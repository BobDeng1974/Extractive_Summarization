it is a time - honored tradition - but @entity1 and @entity2 would rather have been anywhere else than having to watch their dad crack lame jokes as he pardoned the @entity7			1
shuffling awkwardly and rolling their eyes like any teenage girls would while their father laughed at his own - mildly controversial funnies - @entity2 and @entity1 made no attempt to appear anything other than bored stiff			1
indeed , after president @entity16 had pardoned four - month - old , 49 - pound cheese , he asked @entity2 if she wanted to pet the turkey			1
' nah ' , she replied without even smiling , summing up her and her sister 's amusing indifference to the bizarre annual ceremony			2
cracking asides about his recent hotly contested executive action on immigration , @entity16 's shtick left his daughters rigid and disinterested , despite the press corp laughing heartily at the president 's jokes			0
no doubt the girls have heard it all before from their dad but as he relished in his solemn authority to ' spare the lives of two turkeys , @entity36 and cheese ' , both their eyes veered from staring at the floor in embarrassment to barely concealed yawns			1
obviously , like all dads , the president appeared oblivious , smiling and beaming throughout the ritual as he condemned the other turkey , @entity36 to its sad fate			2
' let ’s face it , if you ’re a turkey and you ’re named after a side dish , your chances of escaping @entity52 dinner are pretty low ! ' said @entity16			2
his daughters tried not to fall asleep it seemed through sheer boredom wrap it up dad ! @entity2 almost wills her dad to finish with her eyes while @entity1 has a look that says , ' yup , have heard this all before ' oh god here he goes : @entity2 looks to @entity1 to see if she is as into the @entity52 turkey pardon ceremony as their dad is			1
she is not is it over ? come on dad ! : the president 's daughters dressed in festive colors as they stood by for the turkey pardoning ceremony enthusiasm for tradition : the @entity94 has been announced - a dashing four - month - old bird by the name of cheese bored stiff ? however , the two teenage girls appeared particularly underwhelmed by the affair is he finished ? the girls appear to smile during the ceremony which took place at the @entity64 today cheese - who will be rehomed at a country estate in @entity107 instead of being eaten for dinner - was described as a ' grand champion ' weighing 49lbs			1
his alluring gobble was defined as ' loud ' and ' romantic ' with a ' country ring			0
' this year the @entity64 asked @entity115 users to help decide which bird should receive the official pardon			0
cheese was vying against his buddy , @entity36 but his larger size and head - turning squawk saw him claim victory			2
although only one bird was pardoned , both will be saved from the roasting tray and rehomed at @entity127 , the former home of a @entity107 governor			0
@entity16 joked that he had spared @entity36 and cheese ' from a terrible and delicious fate			2
' @entity132 presidents have been pardoning turkeys since the 1800s as part of the country 's national @entity52 holiday			1
the vote was extended to the public in 2012			0
continuing a family tradition , @entity140 , the chairman of the @entity141 , is responsible for raising the presidential turkey flock each year			1
top catch : cheese - who will be rehomed at a country estate in @entity107 instead of being eaten for dinner - was described as a ' grand champion ' weighing 49lbs soothing tones : his alluring gobble was defined as ' loud ' and ' romantic ' with a ' country ring ' prize specimen : this year the @entity64 asked @entity115 users to help decide which bird should receive the official pardon tradition : @entity132 presidents have been pardoning turkeys since the 1800s as part of the country 's national @entity52 holiday @entity164 occasion : president @entity16 is flanked by his daughters @entity1 ( far right ) and @entity2 ( right ) while @entity167 's breeder , @entity141 chairman @entity140 ( second left ) hold the bird tight his brother previously raised one for the @entity170 in 1996			1
this time around @entity140 began raising 66 birds at his farm in @entity173 , @entity174 , in july with his son @entity175			2
the father - son team then selected two of their finest specimens - based on coloring , size and temperament - and drove them to @entity182 week			0
he selected a hotel that would get them in the mood for a meeting with the president and booked a $ 350 room at the @entity189			0
the custom - suite came complete with a flat screen tv , minibar and wood shaving pit to scratch around in			0
however , it was a little tricky to keep the birds ' behavior in check			0
family affair : @entity16 was joined by his daughters @entity1 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right ) as he announced which turkey he was going to pardon source of amusement : @entity2 smiles at her sister @entity1 ( left ) as their father announces the top turkey ' last night , they were trying to order room service , ' @entity140 joked			1
he made sure he was on hand throughout the night by booking an adjoining room			0
the @entity64 tallied votes on @entity115 until 1pm and the president announced that @entity167 had been named the @entity7 later wednesday afternoon			0
' it 's kind of like @entity214 , you know			0
we 've got the winner and the first runner - up , ' @entity140 told @entity219			2
following the presidential pardon ceremony , the 21 - week - old turkeys will join @entity222 , last year 's winner , to see out the rest their days			1
commercially bred turkeys - more than double the weight of those in the wild - are known to have short lifespans as their large size takes a toll on their internal organs			0
ruffled : cheese and his competitor @entity36 traveled nine hours on monday by car from their home in @entity174 to their lavish $ 350 custom - suite at the @entity189 , complete with a flat screen tv , mini bar and wood shaving pit big moment : but the journey was n't in vain - on wednesday the gobblers met president @entity16 to battle it out for the title of @entity7 - meaning the more beauty sleep they got the better luxurious : an image of the room the @entity64 turkeys were staying in - the bill was footed by the @entity141 rock and roll behavior : apparently the turkeys were trying to order room service as they pecked around their luxury residence			1
