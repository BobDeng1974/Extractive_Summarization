from the squeak of a door to the sound of a bus and the song of a bird , the noises around you are unique to your environment - and all of them make up the @entity12 's ' voice			0
' to catalogue millions of these individual ambient noises , a university researcher from @entity15 is using microphones and sensors to capture ‘ every sound the @entity12 makes ’			2
his project is designed to preserve the world 's changing sounds , and they can also reveal clues about environmental damage			1
these public sounds can be explored on the @entity28 map , and sounds can be filtered by the time of the recording and type of sounds , as well as the location and date later this month , a series of microphones and sensors in @entity15 will go online , designed to capture ambient sounds in the region			1
it follows the launch of the @entity28 project , set up by @entity51 professor @entity50 in april , to coincide with @entity52 2014			1
both projects are designed to capture millions of natural sound recordings , which people around the world can take part in using the @entity28 app for @entity59 and @entity60			1
the @entity28 map features recordings made using the @entity59 and @entity60 app. these public sounds can be explored by clicking red dots on the map			1
yellow stars link through to separate databases that feature numerous sounds from a selected location			0
all the sounds can be filtered by the time of the recording and type of sounds , as well as the location and date			0
people can also use the map to listen specific sounds , depending on their mood			2
for example , the recordings can be filtered by sounds that ‘ make me happy ’ or ‘ stress me out			0
’ they can additionally listen to the existinglibrary of 500,000 natural soundscape recordings from sites in @entity15 , @entity89 and elsewhere			2
all the recordings are added to a database of sounds professor @entity50 and his fellow researchers have been collecting since 1996			1
sounds captured include a dawn chorus in a tropical rainforest in @entity104 , the sound of an ant colony , howls of grey wolves in @entity97 in @entity98 , @entity99 , and urban noises recorded an intersection in @entity108 near the @entity51 campus			1
elsewhere , the @entity28 map features more everyday sounds , including cars driving in @entity31 and trains in @entity33			1
these public sounds can be explored on the @entity28 map , and sounds can be filtered by the time of the recording , and type of sounds , as well as the location and date			1

professor @entity50 said the project shines a ‘ spotlight on the importance of natural soundscapes and the potential for growing research			0
all recordings are added to a database of sounds professor @entity50 and his fellow researchers have been collecting since 1996			1
sounds captured include urban noises recorded an intersection in @entity108 near the @entity51 campus , the sound of an ant colony and howls of grey wolves in @entity99 ( pictured ) the app is available for @entity59 ( pictured ) and @entity60 , and users also have the option of taking pictures of the soundscapes or landscapes they are recording			1
users can listen to soundscapes or the existing library of 500,000 natural soundscape recordings from sites in @entity15 , @entity89 and elsewhere ‘ our aim is to get people from all walks of life and from across the world to record their soundscapes and to answer questions related to how they relate to them			1
‘ we hope to use these collected soundscapes to change the sound of public spaces , hospitals and other venues , replacing them with sounds that make us feel good , sounds that are peaceful and restful			0
’ additionally , professor @entity50 and his team claim sound recordings can help identify changes in climate and the environment			2
the left - hand image is a soundscape depicting a dawn chorus recording in a tropical rain forest in @entity104 in 1996			0
a stream in the rainforest of @entity188 , @entity104 , is pictured right he told @entity191 he believes he ’ll be able to hear changes in the soundscape as the climate evolves			2
previous research has been able to identify dying coral reefs because the fish and other creatures have been quieter , or in some cases , silent , for example			0
‘ as i travel around the world , visiting remote nature parks , it is quite apparent to me that the quality of natural sounds is decreasing as habitats are degraded and animals go extinct , ’ added professor @entity50			2
‘ sadly , we also are replacing these sounds with those made by humans , as noise from planes and cars penetrate deep into wild places on this planet			0
’ the app is available for @entity59 and @entity60 , and users also have the option of taking pictures of the soundscapes or landscapes they are recording .			0

*ecologist* @entity50 is asking people to record sounds on an app
these sounds are *uploaded* to a database created by @entity51
database includes an ant colony , grey wolves in @entity99 , *traffic* in @entity15 and a rainforest in @entity104
an *interactive* map lets users explore recordings from around the world
sounds can reveal information about climate change and damage
the @entity28 project was launched in april and sensors in @entity15 will go online at the end of the month
