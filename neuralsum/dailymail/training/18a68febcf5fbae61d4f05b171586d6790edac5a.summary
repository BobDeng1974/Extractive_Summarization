it 's not uncommon to see a dog on the back of a flat - bed truck , perhaps at a stretch , even the odd pig - but a horse ? police in the northern @entity9 town of @entity10 are stunned by what they have seen - going as far as posting the comment ' speechless ' on social media			1
and animal welfare groups have also expressed their anger , amid claims it was no leisurely drive around the block			0
the ute is believed to have topped 100 kilometres an hour on a state highway			1
no , this is not a horse float			0
police in the northern @entity9 town of @entity10 are stunned by what they have seen - going as far as posting the comment ' speechless ' on social media after photos showed an untethered horse riding on the back of a table - top truck authorities are hoping their decision to post the image on @entity35 , which shows the horse standing in the back , apparently without any sort of restraint , will lead to the identity of the owner			1
it has also sparked much debate about road transport rules in parts of @entity9			2
@entity47 constable @entity46 told the @entity48 the horse had been spotted travelling around @entity50 on the back of the ute quite a few times recently , and in one case a motorist had reported it topping speeds of 100kph on a local highway			1
@entity58 confirming this in the statement : ' this vehicle had been seen at open road speed on @entity63			0
' @entity9 police say other motorists have reported seeing the table - top travel at speeds of 100kph on a highway with the untethered horse in the back some social media comments have taken a light - hearted look at the matter , referring to ' the tail-gate being open ' or ' how much horse - power does that make it ? ' but most have taken a more serious tone , including local police			1
@entity80 quoted @entity58 as providing this statement : ' looking at the horse it seems relaxed - i do n't think anyone would deny that '			0
' however , transporting a horse in that manner on that truck with no sides to speak of , on open and at the moment extremely busy roads is just crazy and dangerous to everybody using the road including the horse			0
' there is nothing to stop that horse or part of it going over the side of the truck			0
' so you can say it 's quiet , trained etc. - but what if the driver has to slam on the brakes or gets hit by another vehicle ? ' or as someone has said it gets spooked by something like a fire truck and siren ? i too have seen other horses transported on the backs of trucks - but never have i seen one on a truck without high sides			2

@entity126 *seeking* *public* 's help to track down the owner of the table - top
