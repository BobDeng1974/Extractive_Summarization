@entity0 has had to have his right testicle removed and has undergone two rounds of chemotherapy , causing his hair to fall out			1
the diagnosis came after the youngster ’s right testicle began to swell in september last year when he took a blow to his groin while playing football at school			1
doctors said it was likely to be inflammation and he was prescribed ibuprofen to decrease the swelling			2
just weeks later he took another knock to his groin when playing at school and was taken to @entity28 and @entity29			2
it was probably this blow that saved his life			0
doctors found his right testicle was significantly larger than his left			1
his parents were told he could have a torsion of the testicle – in which a cord becomes twisted and cuts off its blood supply – or it may be dead and could need to be removed			1
after doctors concluded it was neither of those , a biopsy was taken and it showed there were abnormal cells			0
@entity0 was then transferred to @entity43 where doctors found he had seminoma , a testicular cancer germ cell tumour			1
medics told the family that @entity0 was probably the youngest in the @entity48 , and the world , to be diagnosed with the disease			1
in the weeks since the diagnosis in december , @entity0 has had his right testicle removed and had two cycles of chemotherapy			1
he has also had testicular tubing removed and has had biopsies , ultrasounds and countless blood tests			2
@entity0 , pictured with his parents @entity58 and @entity59 , was diagnosed in december after visiting doctors complaining of a swollen right testicle			1

his father , in a show of solidarity , has shaved his head @entity0 and his family are raising money for the hospital ward where he was treated			2

i thought i had felt heartache before but that nearly killed me			0
@entity0 is taking it all a whole lot better than we thought he would – it ’s probably affected us more than him			2
’ father @entity59 , 32 , added : ‘ the doctors think he is the youngest to have it but said it is one of the most treatable types of cancer so it fills you with hope			2
' it is thanks to those kicks that we found out he had cancer			0
if that had not happened we would never have known – it helped save his life			0
’ cancer of the testicles most commonly affects men aged 15 to 45 , with around 2,200 cases diagnosed each year			0
around 47 per cent of men diagnosed with the disease will be under 35 years old			0
despite it being a relatively rare form of cancer , it is one of the more treatable			0
if caught at an early stage , men can expect a high cure rate with 98 per cent of sufferers disease - free a year after treatment			0
if caught at any stage , 96 per cent of men will still be alive 10 years after their treatment			0
unlike many cancers , there are few known risk factors for testicular cancer			1
men born with an undescended testicle , are at a slightly greater risk			0
around 10 per cent of sufferers will have a history of this condition			0
having a brother or father affected by testicular cancer can also increase a man 's risk			1

my friends have all been really supportive			0
’ dr @entity156 , of @entity157 , said : ‘ only a handful of children are diagnosed each year in the @entity48 with testicular cancer			1
the good news is that , thanks to research into better treatments , most patients diagnosed with testicular cancer survive			1
