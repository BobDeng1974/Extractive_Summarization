by @entity0 published : 03:16 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 04:51 est , 9 july 2012 @entity1 did n't set out to confront gender stereotypes when she split up the boys and girls at her elementary school in rural southwestern @entity6			2
but that 's exactly what happened , with her @entity9 now among dozens of public schools nationwide being targeted by the @entity11 in a bitter struggle over whether single - sex learning should be continued			1
under pressure , single - sex programs have been dropped at schools from @entity17 to @entity18			1
' it does n't frustrate me , ' @entity19 said of the criticism , ' but it makes the work harder			2
' segregation : increasing numbers of schools are splitting up boys and girls as research shows that classes can be better tailored to the needs of each gender while @entity19 's school is believed to be the only one in @entity6 offering single - sex classes , the movement is widespread in states like @entity38 , which has more than 100 schools that offer some form of a single - gender program			1
single - sex classes began proliferating after the @entity43 relaxed restrictions in 2006			1
@entity45 was the secretary of education from 2005 to 2009 under the administration of @entity48			2
with research showing boys , particularly minority boys , are graduating at lower rates than girls and faring worse on tests , plenty of schools were paying attention			1
in 2002 , only about a dozen schools were separating the sexes , according to the @entity59 , an advocacy group			1
now , an estimated 500 public schools across the country offer some all - boy and all - girl classrooms			1
same - sex classes increased under the administration of @entity48 , left , while @entity45 , right , was secretary of education proponents argue the separation allows for a tailored instruction and cuts down on gender - driven distractions among boys and girls , such as flirting			1
but critics decry the movement as promoting harmful gender stereotypes and depriving kids of equal educational opportunities			2
the @entity11 claims many schools offer the classes in a way that conflicts with the @entity81 and @entity82 , a federal law banning sex discrimination in education			1
researchers also have weighed in			2
@entity86 , a former president of the @entity87 , co-authored a review of studies last fall in the journal @entity91 that found research does n't support the benefits of single - sex education			1
additionally , there are lots of problems whenever you segregate people into groups , @entity86 said			2
' stereotyping increases so we really do have lots of data that says it 's just not supported , ' she said			0
however , proponents have put out their own studies , showing the benefits of separating students			0
@entity110 cited the research when it first piloted single - sex classes in a few grades			1
the goal was to address the struggles boys were having in reading			0
targeted : one single sex classroom allowed teachers to address the struggles boys were having reading ( file picture ) the idea proved so popular that single - sex classes have expanded throughout the school			1
parents can opt out , a choice required by law , if they want their kids in a traditional coed classroom			0
in the single - sex classes , teachers use microphones that allow them to electronically adjust the tone of their voice to match the level that research suggests is best for boys			1
when preparing for a test , the boys may go for a run , or engage in some other activity , while the girls are more likely to do calming exercises , such as yoga			0
on a recent tour , @entity19 peeked into a classroom of third grade boys , who had decorated their walls with a camping theme , complete with construction paper campfires and a sign that read ' fishing for books			0
' next door , the third - grade girls opted for an ' under the sea ' motif			0
when they spotted @entity19 in their classroom door way , a few of the girls jumped from their seats and ran to give her a quick embrace			0
they learn the same curriculum , they still lunch and play at recess together , but the differences in their learning environments are apparent , from the blue chalkboards in the boy classrooms , to the red paper hearts that decorated the wall of one of the girl 's classrooms			0
these environments are driven by student interests and what they 're learning at the time , @entity19 said			0
dr. @entity181 , the founder of the @entity182 - based @entity59 , contends the movement is about breaking down gender stereotypes , not promoting them			0
' we want more girls engaged in robotics and computer programming and physics and engineering , ' @entity181 said in a telephone interview			0
' we want more boys engaged in poetry and creative writing and @entity196 language			0
' for advocates like @entity181 , the increase in this form of learning is exciting , but it 's troubling for others			0
the @entity11 launched a national campaign , @entity203 , @entity204 , in may and sent cease - and - desist letters to school districts in @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211			0
the group also asked state officials to investigate single - sex programs in @entity215 , while sending public record requests to schools in another five states , including to @entity19 's school in @entity6			1
@entity220 is legal director of the @entity11 of @entity221 and @entity17 , where he successfully challenged single sex classes in @entity17 's @entity223			1
he argues there 's no proof single - sex classrooms work while there 's plenty of evidence they actually enhance gender stereotypes and lead to sexism			1
' this is n't the right step to address higher dropout rates by boys , ' @entity220 said			0
' they promote false stereotypes about sex - based differences that do n't exist			2
promoting sex stereotypes can harm both girls and boys			2
' both sides agree the idea is not new and has a long history in private schools			2
but @entity246 , staff attorney with the @entity247 , said its history in public schools is much darker and has roots in the @entity38 , where it was broadly instituted in an effort to evade the desegregation requirements of @entity255 to try ' to prevent black boys from being in the same room as white girls			1
' ' in the wake of @entity255 , many schools in the south integrated racially but segregated on the basis of sex , ' @entity246 said			1
@entity265 , a law professor at the @entity266 , addressed this issue at a meeting of the @entity269 : ' think about it , in terms of race , ' she said			0
' what would people say if the state paid for an all - white school or an all - black school ? as long as there was a racial element nobody would have a problem seeing a constitutional difficulty			0
' the analogy drew a heated reaction from @entity181 , who argues that a federal judge in @entity285 debunked this notion when ruling last year against parents who tried to block single - sex classes at a @entity290 school			1
critics like the @entity11 are out of line when they draw parallels to @entity255 , @entity181 said			0
' either they 're really stupid and not able to grasp what the judge is saying in the ruling , or they 're being deliberately misleading , ' he said .			0

@entity38 has more than 100 schools offering single sex classes
