surprising splits within @entity1 now make it highly unlikely that the world ’s most powerful football confederation will put up a candidate to stand against @entity6 for the @entity8 presidency			1
@entity1 had insisted they would field a challenger even if @entity10 decided , as he did in @entity11 last week , to continue for another term as @entity15 football ’s kingpin			1
but that ambition was defeated during a meeting of the 54 @entity15 countries in @entity19 when a number of delegates - notably from @entity22 and @entity23 - made it clear they were happy with the way @entity6 and @entity8 were running the world game			1
then , the @entity1 countries agreed to vote for age and term restrictions for the @entity8 presidency but when the @entity8 vote took place , only 33 of the 54 nations actually backed the limits			1
as a result , none of @entity1 ’s big hitters would want to oppose @entity6 when not even assured of full support within @entity1			1
meanwhile , the sight of @entity10 chilling out at the beach bar at the @entity54 in @entity11 after completing his @entity56 draw duties helped explain why he is content to run @entity15 football for another four years rather than dip his toe in the murkier @entity60 waters			2
trigger - happy @entity62 owner @entity61 is understood to have contacted @entity63 at @entity64 to ask about his assistant @entity65 as a possible manager at @entity67			1
however , the conversation did n’t last long after @entity61 was told that @entity65 , who turned down @entity69 , is earning nearly £ 2million a year in @entity70			1
trigger happy : now sacked @entity62 manager @entity72 with club owner @entity61 wanted : @entity61 made moves for @entity63 's ( left ) no 2 @entity65 ( 2nd left ) but he was too expensive @entity75 , who has kept well out of the limelight since presiding over @entity79 ’s @entity78 debacle in 2011 , is now prepared to take a higher profile , judging by his brief appearance in the @entity82 2015 promotional film for their public ticket sale campaign			1
however , if you blink , you will miss @entity75 ’s nod during a motivational speech by actor @entity89 in the @entity91 dressing room			2
do n't blink : former @entity79 coach @entity75 makes brief appearance in an @entity94 promo video @entity96 ’s ludicrous hyping of presenter @entity97 as the king of their transfer coverage was exposed in their deadline - day promo			2
it showed @entity97 supposedly taking a phone call from @entity104 manager @entity103 , saying : ‘ @entity103 - what have you got for me ? ’ the @entity103 camp understandably objected to @entity103 being presented as a prime source for @entity97 ’s often wayward transfer gossip and the greeting was changed to ‘ hello - what have you got for me ? ’ making deadline : @entity104 boss @entity103 ( right ) , with new signing @entity114 ( left ) , objected to @entity117 ' use of his name in a @entity120 promotion featuring @entity97 @entity122 ’s @entity121 one upshot of the @entity122 ’s assessment of their @entity78 debacle is a change of attitude over @entity79 ’s use of @entity129 before internationals			2
instead of staying there before every game , which had been the plan , the senior team will now only be based at @entity134 when it suits , with the players not relishing the 130 - mile journey from @entity137 to @entity138			0
so @entity79 will again stay at the @entity139 outside @entity140 before wednesday ’s friendly against @entity141 , prompting the question of why they built their £ 100m national training centre deep in the @entity146 countryside			0
sensible stay : @entity148 ( right ) and @entity149 ( left ) train at @entity152 's training base @entity153 in north @entity154 rather than @entity129 130 miles away ahead of @entity79 's friendly against @entity141 meanwhile , sports psychiatrist dr @entity155 cut a remote figure in @entity157 - apart from helping to load baggage on to the bus - as @entity79 ’s @entity78 campaign unravelled			0
yet @entity155 is staying on as part of @entity163 ’s backroom staff when called upon			0
@entity164 , who as @entity79 under 21 manager failed to build a relationship with senior team boss @entity163 , is having no such problems back in @entity168			0
as well as guiding @entity169 to the top of the @entity171 , @entity164 was called upon by @entity173 cricket chief and @entity79 selector @entity174 to deliver a team talk before the county ’s quarter - final against @entity178 in the @entity179			0
‘ @entity184 ’ concentrated on telling the cricketers to maximise their abilities , and @entity173 drubbed their local rivals by 85 runs			0
flying high : @entity164 , whose @entity169 are top of the table , inspired @entity173 cricketers in a talk it 's not too late to play @entity190 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0

@entity6 is likely to run for *re-election* without an *opponent* from @entity1
the confederation had *previously* said they would put up a candidate
@entity1 head @entity200 has ruled himself out of contention
@entity62 owner @entity61 contacted @entity63 at @entity64 about his assistant @entity65 as he looks to *replace* @entity72
@entity103 had his name taken off a @entity208 promo
