by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 06:51 est , 22 april 2013 the zookeepers tried everything , from romantic music to a ‘ love tunnel ’ to get them together and in the mood for passion			0
but when the pandas once again failed to mate at @entity9 , it was decided they needed even more of a helping hand			1
now @entity11 , the female panda , has been artificially inseminated in the hope there will be at last the patter of tiny paws			1
a zoo spokesman said last night she could give birth to cubs by the end of august			1
@entity21 's only giant pandas , @entity22 and @entity23 , had problems during their short mating season and needed help the male panda , @entity26 , nicknamed @entity22 in @entity27 , was expected to mate with @entity11 , known as @entity23 , during her 36 hour fertility window @entity9 zoo management said a successful mating season was critical			1
they need cubs for financial reasons			0
the annual bill for bamboo is £ 70,000 the @entity21 's only female giant panda ( pictured ) was inseminated after just two attempts to get her and @entity22 to mate naturally the decision to inseminate @entity11 – or @entity23 as she is called in @entity27 – comes after just two attempts to get her and @entity26 – or @entity22 - to mate naturally			1
the pandas come into season only once a year and then only for a window of 36 hours between mid april and may			1
it shows the desperation of the zoo management for panda cubs to fulfill their prediction that a million visitors will come to see their most high - profile animals			1
they need the numbers because it is costing the zoo £ 7 million to rent @entity22 and @entity23 for ten years , while the annual bill for bamboo is another £ 70,000 a year			1
in a statement yesterday , the zoo ’s spokesman said : ‘ our specialist team and experts from around the world performed artificial insemination on female giant panda @entity11 in the early hours of this morning			1
natural mating was not attempted			0
@entity26 had been interested and shown consistently encouraging behaviour , however based on his many years ’ experience , our @entity67 colleague professor @entity66 felt that although @entity11 had displayed all of the correct behaviours , she had also displayed signs that told him she would not be conducive to mating			2
’ hopes had been high the two pandas would mate this year			2
the signs were good , with @entity23 showing clear signals she was nearing mating season , including grumpy behaviour and loss of appetite			1
@entity22 explores @entity23 's enclosure and stretches out on the grass			2
the pandas were swapped to explore each other 's environments @entity22 ( pictured left ) and @entity23 ( right ) were played love songs by @entity87 to create an amorous mating environment surprisingly , @entity23 is the mother of two cubs back in @entity67 and @entity22 's father holds the world record for fathering 107 panda pups throughout the last week , keepers swapped the bears between enclosures to prepare them			1
they tuned in radio station @entity97 , which frequently plays songs by @entity99 and @entity87 , to get them in the mood for love			0
the pandas were seen making eyes at each other through the grate separating them in the ‘ love tunnel ’ between their two enclosures			0
sweetie was even heard crying out to @entity22 , who she arrived at the zoo with in december 2011			0
but ultimately , it seems , she just was n’t in the mood			0
the zoo did not put the pandas together to even try and mate , because the animals can turn aggressive			2
sweetie is the mother of two cubs back in @entity67 and @entity22 ’s father holds the world record for fathering 107 panda pups so both are likely to conceive naturally			2
the two pandas were transported from @entity67 to @entity9 in 2011 and are on loan for ten years the zoo opted not to wait another year for the lucrative panda cubs			1
if @entity23 does become pregnant from the artificial insemination , it will take some time to find out			2
giant pandas experience delayed implantation , which means the fertilised egg fails to embed for many days			0
confirmation of whether she is expecting will come in mid-july when she will have an ultrasound scan			0
it is likely that her cub , or cubs , would be born at the end of august or the beginning of september			0
but for now the pandas are taking a break from the weight of public expectation and have been taken off display			0
the zoo ’s spokesman said yesterday : ‘ both pandas and humans are sleeping today			0
‘ the procedures went very much to plan and they are both well , but will be off show until tuesday			0
