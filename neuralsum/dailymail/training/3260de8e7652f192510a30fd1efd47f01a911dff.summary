after seeing the popular 10 hours of walking in @entity4 video , the team at @entity2 ’s @entity1 decided to make a @entity6 version of the popular video			2
and surprisingly , the @entity8 - dressed in a vest top and short skirt - was not catcalled or harassed once			2
as the woman walks through the second most populated city in the world ’s most populated country , several men stare - but nobody catcalls or says anything derogatory			1
‘ not even a single incident of woman street harassment took place in a city that has diversified culture , demographics and economy , ’ a title card at the end of the video reads			0
‘ the female citizens are safe , respected and treated unbiased in this city which never sleeps			1
’ this comes in contrast to actress @entity31 - who was the subject of the original video set in @entity4			0
not even a wolf whistle : walking around @entity6 for 10 hours , @entity8 received no sexual harassment just having a look : the closest the men of @entity6 came to sexually harassing ms @entity8 was staring at her according to the video ' the female citizens are safe and treated unbiased in this city which never sleeps ’ ms @entity31 was told to smile , advised to thank the men for their lewd comments and threatened with rape			1
the difference is stark : in the original @entity4 version , there were more than 100 examples of harassment over the 10 hours ms @entity31 was walking the streets of @entity4 , not including whistles and winks			0
in @entity2 , subject @entity8 received none .			0

@entity8 walked across the city without being sexually harassed
several men start at the woman but nobody says anything derogatory
*filmmakers* say ' female citizens are safe and respected ' in @entity6
