by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent the extent to which savers have been ‘ punished ’ since the credit crunch was laid bare last night			2
low interest rates since the 2007/08 crash have seen those who have sensibly saved throughout their lives losing thousands of pounds - while delivering a bonanza for borrowers			1
research by financial expert @entity12 shows that someone with £ 100,000 in the bank has lost up to £ 21,000 since the start of 2008 thanks to the interest they will no longer be earning on their savings			1
@entity21 governor @entity20 has suggested rates will not rise in the near future - committing savers to years ' more misery every year , the interest income on their money is at least £ 4,250 lower than it would have been in december 2007 , when base rates were higher			1
but a borrower with a £ 100,000 mortgage has enjoyed a bonanza since the start of 2008 , saving more than £ 19,000 if they are on a standard variable rate deal			1
mortgage repayments are now almost £ 3,300 a year cheaper than they would have been at the end of 2007			1
the differing fortunes have occurred because @entity21 base rates are now just 0.5 per cent , compared to 5.5 per cent before the downturn			1
pensioners are disproportionately affected , because they are more likely to have a savings pot than a mortgage			1
even though the economy is now clearly recovering , bank governor @entity20 has suggested rates will not rise in the near future - committing savers to years ’ more misery			1
ms @entity12 , a former adviser to the @entity45 on pensions , said savers had been made the ‘ sacrificial lamb ’ by the government which was keen to see interest rates low in the aftermath of the credit crunch			1
research by financial expert @entity12 shows the extent to which savers have been ' punished ' since the credit crunch and she said she was concerned that many borrowers have been lulled into a false sense of security and will not be able to afford mortgage payments once base rates eventually rise			1
she said : ‘ @entity61 has always valued savers in the past , and people have always been encouraged to save			0
but we ’re not in danger of losing that culture			0
' it ’s the scale of the gains and losses that is stark			0
it is quite staggering the enormous amounts that borrowers have gained by compared to the extent to which savers are losing out			1
‘ savers have put money aside sensibly for the future , expecting to have an income in retirement			1
they have made careful plans so they can set aside money to give them income in retirement			0
' but all their plans are up in smoke because over the past six years they have lost money month on month			0
‘ what has happened is that savers have been made a sacrificial lamb in order to help people borrow sums of money at record low rates			1
’ the research finds that a person with a £ 100,000 standard variable rate mortgage would have paid interest of £ 7,680 a year in december 2007			1
but now the interest stands at just £ 3,280 a year			0
this works out at a saving of £ 3,290 a year or £ 274 a month			0
ms @entity12 said that over the past six years that is a cumulative saving of more than £ 19,000			0
those on tracker mortgages would save slightly less			0
conversely , for someone who has £ 100,000 of savings in a fixed rate bonds , annual interest in december 2007 was £ 5,990 - but by december 2013 it had fallen to £ 1,440 a year			2
this is a loss of £ 4,550 a year , or £ 379 a month			0
over the past six years it will have added up to a loss of nearly £ 21,000			0
for someone whose money is in a @entity115 , the loss will be slightly less - around £ 4,260 a @entity116 added : ‘ this shows that anyone with a mortgage has benefited hugely from higher incomes at the expense of those who saved and did n’t want to borrow large sums			2
‘ people with large mortgages have had an enormous boost to their income , whereas people who have put money aside for the future have seen income fall to support those with huge mortgages			2
there comes a point when you have to ask whether this is socially equitable			0
‘ every society needs savers but what is happening is we are discouraging savers and giving the impression that it is just not worth borrowing , ‘ the danger for the future of the economy is that no country can survive in the long run if all we do is help borrowers and punish savers			2
‘ and once rates go up , many borrowers may find they can not support the additional costs			2
they may have been misled on the mortgages they can afford ’ it comes after a poll over @entity155 found that most people - especially pensioners - want to see interest rates rise			1
over all ages , more people think they will win rather than lose out from higher interest rates - a boost to @entity162 as a rate hike becomes more likely in the run - up to the next election			2
the @entity167 survey showed that two thirds of people think an increase would either make no difference or improve their personal finances			0
pensioners are particularly in favour			2
some 50 per cent of the over- 60s believe a rise in interest rates would make them better off - compared to just 7 per cent who say their finances would suffer			1
@entity181 , divisional manager for @entity182 in @entity183 , said : ‘ while we are currently assessing the extent of the help provided in this case by @entity182 , we can confirm that @entity188 was given support at court through our @entity191			0
‘ we know it takes real courage to come forward and make an allegation of rape and that many complainants find going through the criminal justice process a very distressing experience			0
however , it will be for an inquest to determine the full facts and circumstances of this tragic death			0

base rates now 0.5 per cent , compared to 5.5 per cent before the downturn
pensioners affected as they are more likely to have savings than mortgage
@entity21 governor has suggested rates will not rise in near future
