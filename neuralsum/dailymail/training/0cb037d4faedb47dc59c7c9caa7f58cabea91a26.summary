by @entity0 published : 19:59 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 10:55 est , 30 october 2013 @entity1 appears to be trying to win @entity2 back by helping raise money for a local charity with his latest artwork			1
the elusive artist has taken a painting from a charity shop and added a seated @entity11 officer before returning it to the same shop and allowing them to auction it off for a six - figure sum			1
the @entity18 street artist took his cues from the @entity21 remake as he purchased a painting from the @entity24 shop on 23rd street before adding his own spin to the work and donating it back to the same store			1
the original landscape picture showed sun breaking through clouds above an unspecified mountain range by a river in the woods			1
courting controversy : @entity1 signed below original artist @entity53 @entity1 then added a @entity11 officer with his back facing the viewer , sitting on a bench looking at the scene			1
as verification , the artist posted a picture of the work to his website where he chronicles his daily contribution to @entity2 's art scene			2
he titled the work ' the @entity35 ' on his website			1
he also added his signature beneath that of the original artist , @entity53			2
a spokesperson from @entity24 has confirmed the sale and said that they had no idea who the man was when he dropped off the painting			1
' i do n't know all the details , it was all done very secretively			0
but someone came in and dropped it off as an anonymous donation , ' @entity80 's @entity79 told the @entity84			0
the charity , which is dedicated to helping end homelessness and those living with hiv / aids , received a call confirming the @entity1 connection on tuesday			2
it is being sold via an online charity aution website			2
it was initially listed tuesday evening with a starting price of $ 76,000 according to @entity95			2
as of 11pm local time , it was already up to $ 201,200			0
the painting is being monitored by security and displayed in the window of the 23rd @entity102 branch until online bidding stops at 8pm on thursday october 31			0
just your average thrift shop : housing works is dedicated to helping the homeless and people with hiv / aids protecting the goods : a security guard will be posted in front of the painting until an online auction is completed on thursday evening			1
the price is already up to six - figures that also marks the last day of the @entity18 artist 's self - imposed ' residency ' in @entity2 , where he debuted a new piece of art every day during the month			1
one exception was made on october 23 when he posted on his website that the day 's art had ' been cancelled due to police activity '			0
his new philanthropic turn comes after he penned an op - ed slamming the ' @entity129 ' design that is being built as a replacement for the @entity131			0
his critique - where he called the building a ' shyscrapper ' - landed him in hot water , but he is now earning back goodwill by helping out one of the city 's most popular charities			0
' it â€™s such a great gesture , what he did today is really special			0
he may be controversial , but there is no controversy in the fact that it goes to something good , ' ms @entity79 told @entity145			0
' this is one of the coolest things that has happened to us in a long time			0
