by @entity0 published : 13:42 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 03:37 est , 2 august 2013 hospital bosses have hired a police sniffer dog to stop patients using illegal drugs on the wards			1

the trust treats 40,000 patients with mental health problems every year - some are addicts whose illnesses were caused by years of drug abuse			1
a dog ’s sense of smell is more than 1,000 times as powerful than ours and the moisture on their noses helps trap tiny scent particles			1
wide remit : @entity7 will be policing six of the trust 's hospitals , including @entity54 in @entity17 , pictured above @entity7 underwent about eight week ’s training with former police officer @entity56 who is now also employed by the trust as her handler			1
@entity59 , the medical director of the trust , which has hospitals in @entity17 , @entity63 and @entity8 , said : ‘ she starts at 9am just like the rest of us			1
we like to pick up new ideas and run with them			0
‘ she ’s a lovely dog			0
she is very energetic and lively and charming			0
‘ drugs are everywhere in society and people can potentially bring drugs onto the wards			0
we ’ve even had reports in the past of drug dealers hanging around our hospitals			1
‘ it ’s very important for us to ensure our hospital environments are as safe as they can be and @entity7 is another tool in the box			1
‘ if there are any concerns or suspicions then staff get in touch with the security team and they send @entity56 and @entity7 along and she will do a search			2
‘ drugs and mental illness do n’t mix and we need to do everything we can			0
there is only a small proportion of incidents but they can have a huge impact on vulnerable patients			1
’ @entity7 has been working at the hospital for five weeks and bosses say they were inspired by a similar scheme at @entity100 and @entity102 trust , which hired a sniffer dog two years ago			1
managers at that trust say since @entity106 - a springer spaniel - arrived the presence of drugs on the wards has been drastically reduced and violence has also gone down as he has a ‘ calming ’ effect			2

potential sniffer dogs are selected from the litter when they are just eight weeks old and trainers ’ check their sense of smell by getting them to hunt for hidden toys			0

the dogs live with their handlers - usually police officers - and have a career of between eight and ten years			0
@entity134 , director of nursing and operations at the trust , said : ‘ @entity7 and @entity56 have been an excellent addition to our staff teams and have already made a massive difference to the way we deal with the problem of illegal drug misuse across our services			1
‘ the safety of our patients and staff is our main priority and this scheme will ensure we can continue to offer a safe and supportive environment for those receiving treatment , whilst giving people the confidence to report anything they find suspicious , either in our buildings or anywhere in our grounds			2
’ dozens of hospitals are flouting government guidelines by allowing ambulance - chasing law firms to tout for business on their premises			2
at least 40 @entity166 trusts – around a quarter of the total – are letting personal injury firms display posters and leaflets in hospital wards and @entity173 departments to encourage patients to sue			2
some hospitals are receiving tens of thousands of pounds each , according to @entity176			2
this is despite @entity179 guidelines , issued repeatedly since 2004 , warning that the practice must end			0
it says there is ‘ no place ’ for such advertising , which raises ‘ false expectations of large compensation payouts for minor injuries or that directly or indirectly promotes the bringing of frivolous claims ’			0
the adverts are blamed for fuelling the compensation culture which saw claims against the @entity166 rise 20 per cent last year			0
it emerged recently that the health service has had to set aside more than £ 20billion for future negligence claims			0
as recently as february last year , @entity166 chief executive sir @entity196 told trusts the advertising was ‘ unwelcome ’ and ‘ should not be supported ’ .			0

latest weapon in a hospital trust 's fight against drug dealers is a spaniel
