image represents a service and trademark of @entity11 if being buried in a box underground does n't appeal to you , but you do n't want to be cremated , why not try mummification			1
for centuries , ancient @entity7 mummified pharoahs , and later , other nobility , to preserve their bodies and give them safe passage to the afterlife			0
the ritual eventually died out , yet a company in @entity24 has spent the last 30 years working on bringing it back			1
more than 1,500 people across the world have contacted @entity11 , the world ’s only mummification company , to be preserved after they die			1
and it 's not just for humans			0
the company , based in @entity32 , has previously mummified pets for customers worldwide			1
@entity11 was set up in 1975 by @entity35 , who later changed his name to @entity37 - or @entity38 for short			1
dogs , cats , peacocks , finches and even rats have undergone @entity37 's updated version of the traditional @entity7 burial routine			1

both caskets are covered in gold leaf it is covered with lanolin and wax , followed by layers of cotton gauze and a fibre glass finish			0
the body is then encased in a steel or bronze casket			2
@entity11 counsellor @entity73 told @entity93 : ‘ the chemicals we use are so permeable that if a drop was put on the hand , just seconds later it can be tasted in the mouth			1
' the olden day mummies look very dry and that ’s because it was believed the best way to preserve them for the afterlife was to completely dehydrate them			2
' we do the opposite and believe that hydrating the body fully is the best way to preserve it			0
that 's why the bodies will still look like the day they died - even thousands of years later			1
’ yet the process is n’t cheap			0
cats start at £ 3,600 ( $ 6,000 ) , while dogs cost around £ 15,000 ( $ 25,000 )			1
human mummification starts at approximately £ 40,000 ( $ 67,000 ) but can cost more for ' larger adults			1
' to prepare the deceased for mummification , the internal organs are removed , cleansed and placed back into the body			1
it is immersed in a baptismal font for 70 days			1
the body is then cleansed again , pictured left , before being wrapped in cotton gauze , right			2
it is finally covered in polyurethane , fibreglass resin and metal ' as we have clients from all around the world , including the @entity133 , if a pet dies , then a vet packs it in ice and it is transported to us straight away , ’ continued @entity73			0
some people do like having their mummified pets in their own homes - even animals as small as a rat or finch			2
' ‘ what is amazing is that these animals , like everything else we mummify , just looks exactly like the day it died			0
we test some of the pets after they have been mummified for years and they are perfect			0
’ the first mummified humans were created by @entity11 almost a decade ago , but each had to be opened after 18 months to check on their progress and state law claims that once opened , the bodies must be incinerated			2
the @entity46 mummified bodies because they believed in the afterlife and thought that by preserving their bodies , they would stand the best possible chance of living in the eternal world			0
the process involved washing the dead body as a symbol of purification with wine and water from the @entity61			0
an incision was then made to remove all of the organs			0
these included the liver , lungs , stomach and intestines but the heart was left as it was integral to the life eternal			0
these organs were wrapped in linen and reinserted , and the body was then stuffed and covered with salt in order to dry it out for 40 days			1
it was later cleansed for a second time before being covered with oil to keep the skin elastic			0
@entity11 uses similar techniques , but these have been updated to use more modern materials and processes			1
firstly , the body of the deceased is sent to a local funeral home for traditional funeral services before being sent to @entity32			2
the internal organs are removed , cleansed and placed back in the body , it is then immersed in a baptismal font for 70 days			1
this tank is filled with a preservation solution made up of chemicals , some of which are used in genetic engineering			0
the body is removed from the tank , cleansed again , then covered with a lotion before several layers of cotton gauze are wrapped around it			1
a polyurethane membrane is applied over the gauze , forming a permanent seal , followed by a layer of fiberglass and resin			2
the body is encased within a bronze or stainless steel mummiform , which is then filled with an amber resin , completely surrounding and protecting the mummy			2
the openings in the mummiform are welded closed and it is enshrined within a mummy sanctuary or buried in a local cemetery			0
other humans have signed up to be mummified in the future - and the company said this has tremendous implications for cloning			2
for example , it is feasible @entity228 could be removed at a later date by drilling into the casket			0
@entity73 added : ‘ being able to take out dna at a later date has real appeal for people			0
people like the idea of being able to clone themselves			0
‘ we have a lot of people signed up to be mummified			0
they signed up in their 30 's and 40 ’s , and are now in their 50 ’s and 60 ’s , so we have a lot of work ahead of us			0
