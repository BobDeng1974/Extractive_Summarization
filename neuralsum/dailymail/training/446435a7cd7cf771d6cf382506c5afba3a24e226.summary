by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:59 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 19:03 est , 25 march 2013 @entity2 yesterday laughed off the @entity4 interview that branded him ‘ a nasty piece of work ’ , saying his inquisitor ‘ did a splendid job ’			1
the @entity10 mayor praised @entity11 for the grilling he gave him , and how he focussed on whether mr @entity2 had lied about an extramarital affair			1
but mr @entity2 ’s father took a very different view , denouncing the @entity4 man for a ‘ disgusting piece of journalism ’ during sunday ’s interview			1
he is pictured right visiting @entity27 today visit : mr @entity2 and @entity41 sir @entity40 joined members of the @entity43 on their local beat to launch the mayor 's @entity45 today @entity47 , 72 , said his son had been openly abused on the @entity49 , the corporation ’s flagship weekend political programme , and claimed the @entity4 had ‘ sunk about as low as it could ’			1
‘ @entity11 ’s interview was about the most disgusting piece of journalism i ’ve listened to for a very long time , ’ he told @entity54 in @entity10			1
‘ if grilling people about their private lives , accusing them of guilt by association and openly abusing them is a legitimate interview , then frankly , i do n’t know where we are coming			0
anger : @entity47 , pictured with his son @entity2 , has described the interview as ' disgusting ' ‘ i felt great anger at this man			1
i have no idea who @entity11 is or what he does , but frankly , there is such a thing as respecting the office , even if you do n’t respect the man			0
‘ i do n’t know where @entity11 ’s politics come from , but i suspect he would not have treated the leader of the @entity82 in that way			0
’ during the broadcast the mayor was pressed over whether he lied to then @entity87 leader @entity86 about allegations of an affair in 2004 – which resulted in his resignation as shadow arts minister – as well as claims he was sacked from @entity94 more than two decades ago for making up a quote			2
out and about : mr @entity2 speaks to a member of the public while out on the beat with the @entity43 today ' within his rights ' : mr @entity2 today said mr @entity11 was ' perfectly within his rights to have a bash at me ' arrival : mr @entity2 ( pictured arriving in @entity10 today ) today said : ' if a @entity4 presenter ca n't attack a nasty @entity87 politician what 's the world coming to ? ' @entity2 had his head in his hands after being grilled on live television by @entity11 yesterday insisting that he was talking about ‘ integrity ’ , mr @entity11 turned to a 1990 telephone conversation mr @entity2 had with one of his friends who was demanding the private address of a @entity117 journalist			1
a recording of the call suggested mr @entity2 had agreed to supply the details , even though his friend indicated he wanted to have the reporter beaten up for smearing his family			1
mr @entity11 then asked : ‘ you are a nasty piece of work , are n’t you ? ’ but @entity2 said he had no problem at the approach taken by the interviewer , who is the regular presenter of @entity131 ’s @entity130 programme			1
@entity10 mayor @entity2 had to defend himself over questions about making up quotes , lying about an affair and giving out an address for a journalist to be beaten up the mayor told @entity11 , standing in for @entity49 , that he would not be watching the documentary made about him by @entity139 mr @entity2 appeared thrown as @entity11 grilled him on his sacking from @entity94 more than two decades ago for making up a quote ‘ @entity11 did a splendid job			1
there is no doubt that is what the @entity4 is for – holding us to account			2
‘ i fully concede it was n’t my most blistering performance , but that was basically because i was set to talk about the @entity154 and housing in @entity10 and he wanted to talk about other things , some of them – my private life and so on – of quite some antiquity , the details of which i was n’t brilliant on			0
' he was perfectly within his rights to have a bash at me – in fact it would have been shocking if he had n’t			0
‘ if a @entity4 presenter ca n’t attack a nasty @entity87 politician what ’s the world coming to ? ’ the controversy came as a new documentary was broadcast last night on mr @entity2 ’s ambitions to become prime minister			1
on the spot : @entity10 mayor @entity2 appeared thrown and confused as @entity11 grilled him on a number of subjects , including his sacking from @entity94 more than two decades ago for making up a quote uncomfortable : @entity2 was yesterday granted a prominent interview slot on @entity175			1
its presenter , @entity11 , raised three rackety episodes from the mayor 's life and discerned a pattern of deceit , even of menace in the @entity4 film , the mayor went further than ever before in admitting that he would like to succeed @entity186 , who was two years below him at @entity187 and @entity188			1
‘ obviously , if the ball came loose from the back of a scrum – which it wo n’t – it would be a great , great thing to have a crack at , ’ he said			0
asked if the interview had dented the possibility of his son leading the @entity87 or being prime minister , mr @entity2 senior replied : ‘ @entity2 is clearly a political figure in this country			1
‘ from my point of view , he is not the only conservative political figure , but it seems to me perfectly legitimate that he should , in due course , have a chance to put his hat in the ring			0
’ in the documentary , mr @entity2 ’s sister @entity210 appeared to taunt mr @entity186 by recalling that her brother was captain of the school and elected to @entity187 ’s elite group , known as @entity215 ‘ it gives @entity2 a sense of continuing superiority because he was @entity219 , ’ she said			1
edited transcript of yesterday ’s tv confrontation : @entity11 : the @entity94 let you go after you made up a quote			0
why did you make up a quote ? @entity2 : these are big terms for what happened			2
well , i can tell you the whole thing ... are you sure our viewers would n’t want to hear more about housing in @entity10 ? @entity233 : yes			0
let me ask about another little , er.			0
. @entity2 : well , i mean , i mildly sandpapered something somebody said , and yes it ’s very embarrassing and i ’m very sorry about it			2
@entity233 : let me ask you about a barefaced lie			0
when you were in @entity86 ’s team , you denied to him you were having an affair			0
it turned out you were and he sacked you for that			0
why did you lie to your party leader ? @entity2 : i never had any conversation with @entity86 about that matter and , you know , i do n’t propose ... @entity233 : you did lie to him			2
@entity2 : i do n’t propose to go into all that again			2
@entity233 : the ( @entity139 ) programme includes your reaction as you listen to a phone call in which your friend @entity256 asks you to supply the address of a journalist ... so that he can have him physically assaulted			0
the words “ beaten up ” and “ broken ribs ” are said to you ... @entity2 : yes			2
@entity233 : ... and you , having heard that , you tell your friend , @entity256 , you will supply the address			0
what does that say about you @entity2 ? @entity2 : well i.			2
. @entity233 : are n’t you , in fact , making up quotes , lying to your party leader , wanting to be part of someone being physically assaulted ? you ’re a nasty piece of work , are n’t you ? @entity2 : well , @entity11 , i think of all three things i would dispute ... @entity233 : you do n’t factually dispute them			2
@entity2 : well i do			0
and i can , you know , if we had a long time , which we do n’t , i could explain that i think all three interpretations you ’re putting on those things are n’t wholly fair			0
@entity233 : do you want to be prime minister ? @entity2 : it is completely nonsensical for me to indulge you know this increasingly ... hysterical ... @entity233 : what should the viewers make of your inability to give a straight answer to a straight question ? @entity2 : i think people would rightly conclude i do n’t want to talk about this subject .			1
