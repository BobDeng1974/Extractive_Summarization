@entity1 manager @entity0 insists his players have to step up in the absence of captain @entity4 after a frustrating goalless draw at home to @entity7			1
with a must - win match at home to @entity10 in the @entity11 on tuesday , followed by a trip to @entity13 , the 34 - year - old midfielder was left on the bench until 23 minutes from the end			2
he could not inspire his side to victory but @entity0 admits it should not always be up to him			1
his talent is world - class but that contribution has to come around the team , ' he said			2
' it ca n't be up to him every single game to be the catalyst			2
' it is very hard to replace that quality but going forward that is something of course we will need			0
' he was excellent when he came on and of course he plays on tuesday			0
' he still has that talent , he has world - class ability and it is me looking to manage that			0
' we have a big month			0
until the new year there are big games and the management of @entity4 is fine , there is no problem with that			2
' @entity0 ( right ) decision to rest his captain was in light of @entity1 's crucial @entity11 tie at home to @entity10 on tuesday @entity4 ( right ) came on in the 67th minute as @entity0 ' side pushed for a goal against the @entity7 only @entity62 and @entity63 have scored fewer goals at home than @entity1 's seven and @entity0 ' decision to leave @entity68 out of the squad - meaning he had no striker on the bench - was questioned			1
the @entity72 enjoyed a good loan spell at @entity7 last season and almost joined them in the summer after @entity1 agreed a deal to sell him			1
' that is a decision i make as a manager , ' said @entity0 when asked about the forward 's absence			1
@entity7 manager @entity83 admits he would leap at the chance to take @entity68 back to the @entity85			1
@entity4 's introduction could not help @entity1 get the goal they needed as it finished 0 - 0 @entity7 boss @entity83 ( right ) watches on the touchline alongside @entity1 boss @entity0 ' i would love to , ' he said before attempting to address the collapse of the transfer			1
' it is difficult to explain			0
it was a long summer and the things everyone knows , we agreed a price and we flew to @entity98 ( for @entity1 's pre-season tour ) and he did n't come			1
' the bottom line is he is not with us			0
i am trying to concentrate on what we have got			0
' what they had was good enough to keep their hosts at bay , having been beaten 4 - 1 by @entity108 in midweek			0
' first half we were much better with the ball than in the last three or four games , ' @entity83 added			2
' we are just missing that cutting edge but in the rest of the game we were quite good			0
