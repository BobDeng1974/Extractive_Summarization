i ’ve been out injured for a whole year now , but i ’m finally on the verge of a return to regular training			1
it ’ll be such a relief after such a long time out			0
i ’m actually in my last week of rehab at the moment , then i ’ll transfer to normal training and introduce more cycling into my routine			1
the year has been so mentally and physically tough , but now i can finally look forward			1
@entity11 's @entity13 cyclist @entity12 is desperate to get back on to the track after her recent injuries @entity18 , pictured during a fashion shoot in @entity17 , has been sidelined for a whole year @entity19 cyclist @entity18 supported boyfriend @entity20 during @entity23 ' @entity22 campaign the most frustrating thing was that one moment i ’d be completely fine on the bike , then the next i would be in a lot of pain			1
this happened a lot during my training up in @entity17 , so in october we all sat down and decided the best thing was to send me to @entity35 rehabilitation centre			1
they had everything i needed there – physios , masseurs , coaches – and they did such a great job getting me better up until i left there three weeks ago			2
of course , if i did n’t have my @entity45 funding i would n’t be able to go through all this			0
it ’s so great that , despite my injury , they carried on supporting me the whole time			2
you ’d think that , with 12 months away from the bike , i ’d have plenty of time to myself			0
but in reality , i never thought i ’d be out for that long – i kept having setbacks after thinking i was about to return so i could n’t stop and enjoy myself			0
obviously , there was the stress of being injured as well – but my puppy @entity60 helped me with that ! i did , however , see plenty of the @entity22 , which i do n’t usually get to do because it clashes with my season			1
though being at the @entity65 for the opening loss to @entity67 was n’t great – you can imagine how my boyfriend @entity20 took it			1
all in all , this injury could have made or broken me			2
there were many times i thought i was losing the battle , but i worked through any doubts i had			0
i have learnt a lot about myself in the last year – both as an athlete and a person – and i believe the whole experience will benefit me in the long run			2
right now , with @entity79 on the horizon , i ’m more motivated than ever			0
as well as funding the @entity13 athletes , every week @entity45 players raise over £ 33 million for arts , heritage , charity , community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities			0
