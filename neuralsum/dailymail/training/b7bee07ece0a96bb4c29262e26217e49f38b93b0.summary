@entity13 then nearly laid the second on a plate for @entity14 who missed the chance			0
he was defended before the game by coach @entity101 against the suggestion that he needs to work harder but the former @entity104 man was certainly putting in a shift as @entity2 continued to dominate albeit with limited success against an athletic side playing the offside trap well and catching out real nine times in the first half hour			0
the offside trap could n't save them on four minutes before the half time whistle however when @entity14 climbed above everyone else in the @entity4 six - yard box to head home @entity2 's second from a @entity36 corner			1
@entity47 replaced @entity46 at half time with the defender withdrawn complaining of a calf muscle			0

@entity4 had a rare opportunity at the other end but @entity43 got down sharply to his left to prevent @entity152 ' effort beating him at his near post			0
@entity14 got his second and @entity2 's fourth from @entity0 's cross and it was show of selflessness from the @entity138 on a hat - trick but squaring the ball to his often criticized team - mate			1
it was @entity0 's 50th assist in a @entity2 shirt			2
he threatened to grab his hat - trick with a header from @entity44 's cross but it was saved by @entity58			1
moments later he had the third although he knew little about it , turning @entity45 's shot in with his hip amid complaints from athletic players that the ball had also touched his elbow			0
despite it being the fifth in an easy win , and also slightly fortuitous , @entity0 celebrated it with all the usual gusto			0
