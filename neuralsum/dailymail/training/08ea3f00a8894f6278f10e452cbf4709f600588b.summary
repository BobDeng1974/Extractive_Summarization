@entity0 says he would welcome @entity1 back at @entity2 and hopes to see him one day return to his hometown club			1
the @entity6 striker is in line to face the @entity8 at @entity9 on saturday afternoon having recovered from the ankle injury he suffered during a summer tour of @entity13			1
it is approaching four years since @entity1 sensationally moved from @entity2 to @entity15 in a £ 35million transfer			1
@entity1 ( right ) celebrates with @entity17 after the latter scored against @entity19 last week @entity1 came through the ranks at @entity2 , before his £ 35 million move to @entity15 the 25 - year - old continues to be linked with a return to @entity24 and , rather than kill such speculation , @entity0 admits it could happen			1
‘ i think he would ( want to come back one day ) , and i hope he does come back to his hometown , ’ said the @entity27 boss , who also backed @entity1 for an @entity29 recall			1
‘ he has got that love here			2
i really enjoyed working with @entity1			1
i think he 's a terrific player			0
i know we get linked with him every two weeks , which is always probably going to happen whether it 's me or another manager			0
‘ so i 'm not going to hide from the fact that i like him			0
i 'm not sure that it 's something that 's imminent for us in this window , because he looks fairly happy to me at @entity6			0
‘ i think it 's difficult to take players who are happy out of @entity44 teams			0
’ @entity2 , of course , chose to cash in on their academy product when @entity15 laid down a record fee for a @entity50 player in january , 2011			1
@entity0 , though , never felt the move to @entity52 was right for the @entity54 frontman			1
‘ i think the @entity15 thing , for me , was a strange one , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity1 's style was against the way they play			1
@entity1 struggled to make an impact at @entity15 , so went on loan to @entity6 , before joining for £ 15 million when @entity1 returned to @entity2 , some fans held negative banners , but @entity0 would love him back ‘ he 's much more suited to @entity6 and i think he 's been a big success there , i really do			1
actually , if you speak to any @entity6 fans , they 'll tell you that			0
‘ the only problem is getting him on the pitch - that 's been his biggest issue			0
if he can have a run , there 's no problem with it			0
‘ he 's not just a target man , he 's a good footballer and a real presence of the pitch that can win games			0
’ @entity1 missed the bulk of last season with an @entity83 problem and has been plagued by injuries since leaving @entity85			2
@entity0 , however , feels there is no long - term issue			2
‘ i think @entity88 ( @entity89 ) was right in his assessment of @entity1 - he 's sometimes too brave for his own good , ’ he added			2
‘ he 's going full - hearted for challenges when he 's off - balance			2
he does that in training as well as in games , so , of course , when you 're in a rehab situation he 's over-zealous at times purely because he 's got that good , football aggression			0
@entity1 has struggled with injury in recent months , but is now back fit and in the @entity6 first team @entity1 battles with @entity101 and @entity102 during a @entity44 match last saturday ‘ but i do n't think there 's anything structurally wrong with him - or a major issue			1
he 's just that type			0
@entity108 used to get a lot of injuries			0
it comes with that role			0
’ @entity112 , meanwhile , is another player taking on his former club on saturday			1
the midfielder skippered the side under @entity0 and the @entity2 manager admits that he is indebted to the @entity117			1
‘ @entity112 was brilliant at this football club , ’ he said			1
‘ we owe him a lot - all the players here - with the professionalism he brought and the winning mentality			0
‘ i would like more @entity112 's in my group			2
‘ he 's a very special sort of person in the changing room , and he brings that to whichever club he goes to , that winning mentality , and that 's why he 's had such a fantastic career			2

@entity1 is in line to face his former club @entity2 on saturday
@entity2 boss @entity0 admits he hopes to see him back one day
@entity0 was full of *praise* for @entity1 , and would welcome his return
@entity112 also lines up against his former club on saturday
