from @entity1 winning the @entity2 to @entity3 at @entity5 's funeral - we all know big boys really can cry			0
but a few tears over a bad batch of buns was a step too far for fans of the @entity12 , as tears from two male contestants on tuesday 's show provoked a @entity17 tirade accusing both of being a ' # crybaby '			1
first it was @entity20 , the 46 - year - old teacher from @entity21 in @entity22 , who turned on the waterworks as he explained to the cameras after the disaster that was his almond and apricot brioches and sticky caramel kannelbullen that were so sticky they stuck to the tin			1
but when @entity31 , 51 , who was ditched by judges @entity32 and @entity34 - and the graphic designer - turned - coucil worker from @entity36 seized the chance to show off his own lip - wobbling skills			1
programmes such as @entity55 's @entity54 have already been slammed for relying too much on ' sob stories ' in a poor attempt to stir viewers ' emotions			1
and the @entity61 cookery contest escaped none of the abuse last night , with @entity64 joining in the @entity17 tirade : ' crying is for when we lose the @entity68 , not when you f * * * up your buns on @entity12			1
' @entity71 tweeted ; ' @entity20 crying over his failed brioches on @entity12 makes you realise what an easy life you lead			1
' @entity76 wrote : ' why are people crying on bake off ? it 's not life or death if you 've burnt your cake ! ' while @entity85 said : ' b * * * * * hell great @entity84 bake off is turning into x factor with all these sob stories			1
' others took a more tongue - in - cheek view of the whole spectacle , with @entity92 commenting : ' only in the @entity84 would people cry over slightly disappointingly baked goods			0
' though they were in a minority , one or two fans admitted that their own heartstrings had been tugged , with @entity99 tweeting : ' had to pretend to be texting so my mum would n't see that i was crying at @entity12			2
' break down : @entity20 's brioches did not survive his attempts to bash them out the tin during the show , @entity20 produced a series of unimpressive bakes - his caramel kannelbull earning the put - down from @entity32 : ' what you 've actually got is a very , very sharp , sour - tasting cinnamon			2
it does n't taste good - have you tried one of these yet ? ' and when it came to his almond and apricot brioches , @entity32 said : ' apricots have just been plonked on top like that			0
' even @entity34 had to concede of the kannelbull : ' sadly this is something that really has n't worked			0
' earlier , his signature bake - a ' @entity125 ' - was declared ' definitely underbaked '			0
but even this could not compete with @entity31 's all - too experimental signature bake - a tea loaf flavoured with hemp			2
unusual : @entity34 appears confused by the ingredients of @entity31 's @entity133 loaf and his ' peachy buns ' that failed to taste of peach and @entity136 that were ' very dry ' were the proverbial icing on the cake of his defeat			2
having treated us all to a good weep before the judging , @entity20 would not let himself be upstaged by @entity31 's dramatic exit , as he turned the taps on again in the final moments of the show to choke : ' i feel terrible – it should have been me			1
so now i have to do it			0
i have to carry on and do well			0
' and then came @entity31			2
' it ’s been an absolutely fantastic experience and there are people in there who i have been very , very close to ... ' he sobbed			0
' they are such fantastic bakers and i am dead chuffed that i was there with them			0

@entity12 episode six ended in tears from two contestants
@entity20 cried before cameras , expecting to be voted off
@entity31 was eventual loser - and gave us some tears of his own
viewers *cricitise* ' sob stories ' on @entity17 and say show is too sentimental
