a forged police letter obtained by @entity1 casts new light on the @entity4 ’s controversial decision to drop its documentary on @entity6			1
it was handed to this newspaper last week by a woman who appeared on the @entity11 programme which exposed the entertainer as a predatory paedophile			1
identified only as @entity14 , she said the letter backed her claims that @entity16 had dropped its investigation into the sex abuse allegations because of @entity20 's ill health and ' senility '			1
allegations : ' @entity14 ' during the @entity11 documentary on @entity6			1
she this week handed the @entity1 a forged police letter casting new light on the @entity4 's decision to drop its documentary on the late presenter newsnight journalists were desperate to see the letter because its contents were apparently at odds with what they had been told – that officers were unable to proceed because of lack of evidence			1
producers believed the letter would provide the breakthrough they needed to revive their stalled investigation and get the ten - minute film aired			1
however , @entity14 never sent it to them , and the @entity45 team began to doubt whether it ever existed – and if everything they were being told was the truth			0
the @entity4 has been heavily criticised for shelving the item on @entity20 , which was due to air just a few weeks before @entity52 tributes to the late presenter			1
on friday , it agreed to establish an independent inquiry into why the film was dropped			2
however , last night corporation sources indicated that their dealings with @entity14 – who they said ‘ appeared to be playing games with us ’ – was a contributory factor			2
the @entity1 has seen the letter – and the @entity4 ’s fears appear to be justified because it is unquestionably a fake			1
the note says that @entity14 was interviewed by police in 2006 despite the inquiry not beginning until may the following year			0
the letter is also headed by a @entity16 crest not in use at the time it was supposedly written			1
significantly , there are no reference numbers included within the text			0
a spokesman for @entity16 said : ‘ this letter is not genuine and was not sent by us at any time			1
the suggestion that we advised anyone this case would not be pursued due to the health of the individual concerned is wholly inaccurate			2
‘ an investigation file was passed to the @entity81 who advised there was not enough evidence to charge			2
all those involved were updated accordingly			0
’ the @entity4 has been heavily criticised for shelving its @entity45 item on @entity20 , which was due to air just a few weeks before @entity52 tributes to the late presenter for her part , @entity14 denies forging the letter			1
although she initially insisted that it was genuine , last night she conceded that she may have been the victim of a hoax			0
an @entity11 spokesman declined to comment on the letter last night			1
a source said the programme ’s production team was aware of the letter ’s existence , but had not seen it			2
the insider added that the @entity11 documentary – exposure : the other side of @entity6 – centred on the experiences of girls at the hands of @entity108 , rather than the police investigation			1
@entity14 was first contacted by a @entity45 reporter on november 3 last year			0
she was told the @entity4 wanted to ‘ verify a few details about what happened there in the @entity114 ... in relation to @entity6 ’s visits to the home ’			1
@entity14 claims she spoke with reporters about the allegations of abuse surrounding the presenter and told them about the letter she claimed was sent by @entity124 police officer @entity123 in 2007			1
the @entity45 team contacted her on november 11 and 22 , and again on december 12 asking to see the letter			2
@entity14 claims that she did not respond to the requests because she no longer wanted to be a part of the documentary			2
' sexual predator ' : the @entity4 could be forced to pay compensation if they are found to be linked to the claims that @entity6 molested children she added : ‘ in one of the emails i received from the @entity45 team they said it was n’t just me , that others had also said it , so i always assumed others had been given a letter like mine			1
‘ the @entity45 reporters told me that they had hit a brick wall with the investigation and they needed to see the letter i had received from the police			2
‘ i assumed other people had received [ the letter ] giving the same reasons			0
i had spoken to other people who had been told the same things as to why the investigation was n’t going ahead			0
‘ one of the reporters wanted me to send it to her so i scanned it on the computer and tried to send it in an email			0
when they did n’t receive it i assumed i had done something wrong but i did n’t resend it			0
’ in a final email , a @entity45 reporter wrote : ‘ we ’ve come up against a brick wall in our story – the @entity81 tell us the reason they dropped the inquiry is they did n’t have enough evidence			0
that contradicts what you and others have told us			0
we can only get round this by seeing the letter			0
any chance ? ’ @entity14 said last night : ‘ i now understand the significance of not sending them the letter and i am possibly responsible for them not being able to run the story			0
‘ when they asked for it again i decided this had turned into an argument between who was right , the girls or the @entity81			0
it should n’t be about what the @entity81 were saying , it should have been about the girls			0
