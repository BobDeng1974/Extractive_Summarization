by @entity0 published : 08:09 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 08:28 est , 22 april 2013 @entity1 appeared on this morning today to defend her claim that women must be thin to be happy @entity1 is no stranger to controversy and last week the writer caused a stir by claiming that any woman who wants to be happy needs to be on a constant diet			1
42 - year - old @entity1 confessed that she has been on a diet for 30 years in a feature for the @entity11 , and encouraged other women to do the same			1
she wrote : ' the logic is simple and irrefutable : any self - respecting woman wants to be thin , and to be thin you need to spend your life on a diet			2
' i do n't believe overweight is ever attractive			2
whether we like it or not , we live in an age and a part of the world where men and women regard thin as beautiful			1
' @entity1 was writing an opinion piece in response to news that @entity30 had revealed that the secret to her good looks was to spend every day of her life dieting			1
@entity1 added : ' @entity30 , 79 , said she controlled her weight during a long career so that she could stay in work - an entirely laudable attitude			1
' like @entity30 , i have no intention of letting my body slide flabbily into middle age			1
i believe that any woman with a modicum of self - respect should watch her figure with the same vigour			2
is it any coincidence that @entity30 is still attractive and in demand for work ' @entity1 's comments divided readers and she was soon trending on @entity51			1
today the outspoken blonde appeared on this morning to defend her views that women can only be happy if they are thin			1
she said : ' in the article i talk about the first time that i realised that i was overweight and overlooked and chose to do something about it			1
i am not suggesting that anyone follows my 14 - year - old self 's diet methods but we do have a massive problem in this country with obesity			2
66 per cent of the population are obese and 25 per cent of 4 and 5 year olds are overweight , it is a massive issue			2
' i put on weight while undergoing ivf treatment and my husband has been incredibly supportive but yes i do think that he would leave me if i got fat			1
' journalist @entity1 appeared alongside @entity73 a writer and positive body image campaigner joining the debate was writer and positive @entity80 campaigner @entity73			1
@entity73 , who admitted that she has suffered from an eating disorder in the past , started the @entity83 campaign which educates young girls on self - esteem			1
she said : ' there are hundreds of ways to be gorgeous			0
we believe that healthy and confident is beauty , and healthy and confident means different things to different people			0
' we are not all born to be skinny			0
' women who are confident and rock their own brand of gorgeous are much more attractive			0
some people let being thin take over their life			0
i do n't know much about your life @entity1 but it seems that you ca n't let go and enjoy yourself so i actually feel very sorry for you			1
' at the end of the debate just 6 % of viewers agreed with @entity1 that you can only be happy if you are ona diet while 94 % agreed with @entity73 's view that @entity1 's opinion is dangerous and that we should concentrate on being healthy and happy			1
@entity1 told the @entity108 : ' every woman who voted against me during the debate needs to take a long hard look at the digits on their scales			1
' i find it extremely alarming that , even though 1 in 4 @entity115 women are obese and 66 % are overweight - they still believe diet is a dirty word and that it leads to eating disorders			0
there is zero evidence to back this up			0
' i 've yet to meet a woman ( myself included ) who has lost a lot of weight and wished they remained fat			2
the fact remains that obesity costs @entity115 business £ 2billion a year and obesity is estimated to cost the @entity130 £ 6billion in the next 2 years			0
who is going to pay for this ? ' we 've made drinking - driving and smoking in public unacceptable - we need to do the same with over-eating and the excessive consumption of calories			0
there are grave consequences to pay if we do n't do this ; there is a generation of children who will be buried by their parents if we do n't recognise that eating more than we need is leaving us at risk of heart disease , diabetes and various cancers			0
' i stand by my position that fat is failure			2
every time someone eats more than they need they are failing themselves , their children and society - by assuming someone else will pick up the health tab for their eating habits			0
' i know how hard it is to change cooking and eating habits			0
it took me years and is something i write about honestly in my memoir : @entity166 in @entity167			0
there is no greater pleasure than cooking your own food , with the aware of its calorie contents and eating it with family and friends			0
' @entity73 is co-founder of @entity83 , a positive body image campaign @entity73 told @entity108 : ' at @entity83 we work very hard to promote the ' spectrum of beauty '			1
we believe that there are thousands of ways to be gorgeous regardless of shape , size , age or weight			0
' trying to conform to a very narrow beauty ideal sadly dominates far too many people 's lives and stops them from reaching their potential			0
@entity1 's @entity192 's message that thin automatically equals beautiful is potentially damaging to anyone young or vulnerable that reads her work			1
fortunately , times are changing and opinion 's like @entity192 's are becoming rarer and increasingly perceived as outdated			0
' the response @entity83 has had following the debate has already been phenominal			2
we speak for real people , with real , healthy bodies who want to rock their own unique brand of gorgeous '			0
