by @entity0 published : 12:51 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 12:51 est , 2 august 2013 in news that will come as no surprise to many long - suffering @entity7 women , fashion , dancing and multitasking have been named as the skills @entity7 men are worst at			1
new research out today found men are also woeful at remembering significant dates such as birthdays and anniversaries , carrying out most domestic chores and buying clothes for a partner			1
they also lack skill at buying gifts in general , picking home furniture and cooking more complicated dishes			2
while some @entity7 men think they have the ' moves like @entity24 ' or the fashion sense of a young @entity26 , many more are less confident researchers said the findings showed modern men still rely on women to do the majority of chores and tasks that should involve both partners in a relationship			1
however , it seems men can be relied upon to hurt themselves doing @entity38 , buy wrong size clothes for a partner and get drunk at a family function			1
they are also more likely than women to miss a flight after sleeping in , forget to pick up children from school or an event , forget an anniversary or birthday and miss work because of a hangover			0
the survey of 1,000 adults was commissioned by sauce brand @entity53 for the launch of its pop - up men ’s skill schools in @entity58 and @entity59 , in which experts will pass on tips on everything from dancing to fashion to remembering key dates			2
the poll found 36 per cent of men believe they lack cooking skills , 38 per cent think they are bad at dancing and 36 per cent think they are terrible when it comes to public speaking			1
perhaps surprisingly , 35 per cent of men thought they were no good at @entity38 , while 21 per cent did not rate their chances on the sports field			2
not only do @entity7 men struggle to remember significant dates , they also lack skills in buying present men also rated themselves low when it comes to buying gifts for a loved one ( 52 per cent ) , remembering birthdays or anniversaries ( 33 per cent ) and doing domestic chores ( 30 per cent )			1
1 buying clothes for partner 52 % 2 remembering anniversary / birthday 41 % 3 dancing 33 % 4 ironing 31 % 5 cooking 30 % 6 domestic chores 30 % 7 buying gifts 28 % 8 multitasking 22 % 9 keeping up with fashion 22 % 10 picking furniture 21 % in fact , the only skills that men rate themselves as better than women at are killing insects , changing a car tyre and putting up shelves			1
they also rate themselves better in the gender stakes at playing video games , barbequing and playing sport			0
both sexes agree that men are generally better at some things - such as telling jokes , tying a bow tie , fixing computer problems and eating spicy food			0
however , there is only a slim chance that men will improve in the gender race - three in four ( 76 per cent ) say they are “ good enough at the skills they care about ”			2
it ’s bad news for the opposite sex , with nearly one in 10 ( nine per cent ) of women desperately wishing their partner was better at a range of skills			0
four in 10 ( 43 per cent ) of all the survey respondents thought men were generally worse than women at many life skills , while a third ( 32 per cent ) said today ’s men are no better than their fathers at certain skills			0
a spokesman for @entity53 said : ' our research shows many men are lacking in skills which women seem to have grasped			0
' in fact , time seems to have stood still for many men when it comes to skills like ironing , shopping , multitasking and keeping up with fashion			0
' we hope this research is a rude awakening to those millions of men who still rely on their partners for a variety of skills round the home			0

buying clothes for a partner is the skill @entity7 men lack most
remembering important dates and moves on the dance floor were next
36 % of men have no cooking skills , and 35 % think they are no good at @entity38
think they are better than women at are killing insects , changing a car tyre and putting up shelves
