an asteroid the size of a whale was today on its final approach to a nail biting encounter with @entity5 on sunday evening			1
similar in size to the @entity9 meteorite that exploded over @entity12 ’s @entity11 region in february 2013 , @entity6 says we will have a ‘ very close ’ shave - but that there is no risk			0
at the time of closest approach , asteroid 2014 @entity16 will be one - tenth the distance from the centre of @entity5 to the moon , or about 25,000 miles ( 40,000km )			1
at time of closest approach , it will be one - tenth the distance from @entity5 to the moon			1
@entity27 indicated on the graphic are @entity29 at its closest point to @entity5 will be above @entity32 on 7 september at about 20.18 bst			1
at the time of closest approach , asteroid 2014 @entity16 will be one - tenth the distance from the centre of @entity5 to the moon , or about 25,000 miles ( 40,000km )			1
astronomers say the asteroid will pass below @entity5 and the ring of communications and weather satellites orbiting about 22,000 miles ( 36,000km ) above our planet ’s surface			1
to watch the approach live visit the @entity45 space telescope			0
astronomers have dubbed the asteroid ' pitbull ' because of its small size and threatening path			0
the news comes just days after @entity52 told @entity53 that the world is ill - equipped to deal with asteroid threats , which could someday wipe out humanity			1
from its reflected brightness , astronomers estimate that the asteroid is about 60ft ( 20 metres ) in size			1
at its closest point to @entity5 will be above @entity32 on 7 september at about 20.18 bst			1
' amateur astronomers with small telescopes might glimpse the fast - moving appearance of this near - @entity5 asteroid , ' @entity6 said			1
astronomers say the asteroid will pass below @entity5 and the ring of communications and weather satellites orbiting about 22,000 miles ( 36,000km ) above our planet ’s surface			2
it was initially discovered on the night of august 31 by the @entity77 near @entity78 , @entity79 , and independently detected the next night by the @entity80 1 telescope in @entity82			0
an asteroid the size of a whale will have a ‘ very close ’ shave with @entity5 on sunday , @entity6 has reported			2
this image shows the orbit of @entity88 around the sun. the asteroid is about 60ft ( 20 metres ) in size the asteroid was initially discovered on the night of august 31 by the @entity77 ( pictured ) near @entity78 , @entity79 , and independently detected the next night by the @entity80 1 telescope in @entity82 ‘ while this celestial object does not appear to pose any threat to @entity5 or satellites , its close approach creates a unique opportunity for researchers to observe and learn more about asteroids , ’ it added			1
asteroid 2014 @entity16 will not hit @entity5 , but its orbit will bring it back to our planet 's neighbourhood in the future			1
the asteroid 's future motion will be closely monitored , but no future threatening @entity5 encounters have been identified , according to @entity6			2
however , earlier this week , @entity52 warned @entity53 that ‘ there is an asteroid with our name on it and it will hit us			1
’ no one really knows when a serious impact could happen			0
‘ it could be tomorrow , ’ professor @entity52 tells @entity53			2
‘ the thing that bothers me about that is we do know how to do something about it ’ and no one really knows when a serious impact could happen			0
‘ it could be tomorrow , ’ professor @entity52 told @entity53			1
‘ the thing that bothers me about that is we do know how to do something about it			0
’ he referred to the bus - sized asteroid , named 2014 @entity134 , came within 38,300 ( 61,637km ) miles of @entity5 in march - around a sixth of the distance between the moon and our planet			1
the date of @entity5 's potential destruction has been set at 16 march 2880 , when an asteroid hurtling through space has a possibility of striking our planet			2
researchers studying the rock found that its body rotates so quickly that it should break apart , but somehow remains intact on its @entity5 - bound trajectory			2
they believe it is held together by cohesive forces known as @entity151 - and although this is considered a major breakthrough , scientists still do n't know how to stop it			0
the discovery was made by researchers at the @entity156 ( @entity29 ) , @entity157			0
previous research has shown that asteroids are loose piles of rubble held together by gravity and friction			0
the asteroid is travelling at about 9 miles ( 15km ) a second relative to the @entity5			2
it is due to swing so close to @entity5 it could slam into the @entity167 at 38,000 miles per hour			0
it is estimated that if 1950 @entity168 were to collide with the planet , it would do so with a force of around 44,800 megatonnes of @entity171			0
although the probability of an impact is only 0.3 per cent , this represents a risk 50 per cent greater than an impact from all other asteroids			0
and it was n’t the only one threatening @entity5			0
@entity6 is currently tracking 1,400 ' potentially hazardous asteroids ' and predicting their future approaches and impact probabilities			0
the threat is so serious that former astronaut @entity181 has described it as ‘ cosmic roulette ’ and said that only ‘ blind luck ’ has so far saved humanity from a serious impact .			0

2014 @entity16 will be above @entity32 at 20.18 bst during closest approach
amateur astronomers with telescopes might be able to see it graze past
@entity16 , which is 60ft ( 20 metres ) , is not *expected* to hit @entity5
but its orbit will bring it back to our planet 's neighbourhood in the future
approach will be *broadcast* live online
news comes just days after @entity52 told @entity53 that the world is ill - equipped to deal with asteroid threats
