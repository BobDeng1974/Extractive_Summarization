by @entity0 the @entity2 and the subsequent expansion of the @entity4 did not need @entity5 to set it off , theoretical physicist @entity1 suggested to an audience in @entity8 this week			1
a combination of quantum theory and the theory of relativity would a better explain our existence than divine intervention , he told a packed auditorium at the @entity17			1
and he suggested that turning to the dark side could illuminate fundamental questions about how the @entity4 began			1
easily the world 's most famous theoretical physicist - perhaps the only one the most people can name - @entity1 more then filled the 1,100 - capacity auditorium laid on by @entity17 for the event			1
queues to hear the @entity37 author started forming a 8am , 12 hours before his talk was scheduled to begin , the @entity25 reported			1
by 6pm , those eager to see him in person stood in a line a quarter - of - a - mile long , according to @entity43 , and still many were forced to sit in an overflow space			2
and when that was filled , a thousand more say on a lawn outside the lecture theatre which had been equipped with a big screen and sound system , in a manner after @entity52 's @entity51			0
in a wide ranging talk , the former @entity54 professor recapped various theories of the beginning of the @entity4 , caricaturing the religious position with the myth of an @entity61 tribe whose god vomited the @entity63 , @entity64 and stars			2
he also discussed theories which suggest that existence in fact had no beginning , and claimed that @entity71 's observations of an expanding @entity4 and @entity73 's theory of relativity had disproved those			1
best seller : @entity1 's @entity76 spent a record - breaking 237 weeks in the @entity78 @entity77 best - sellers list he also had time for a few jokes , one of which paraphrased @entity84 's response to a young man who dared to ask what @entity5 was doing before he made the world			2
' if one believed that the universe had a beginning , the obvious question was what happened before the beginning ? ' he asked			0
' what was @entity5 doing before he made the world ? was he preparing @entity95 for people who asked such questions ? ' attempting what could be seen as a kind of @entity100 in cosmology , @entity1 tried to explain his point of view that such questions were nonsensical			2
' the problem of what happens at the beginning of time is a bit like the question of what happened at the edge of the world , when people thought the world was flat , ' he said			0
he suggested that the idea of time running in only one direction ' like a model railway track ' was misconceived and that combining of general relativity and quantum theory can allow time to act just like another direction in space			1
' this means one can get rid of the problem of time having a beginning , in a similar way in which we got rid of the edge of the world , ' he said			0
@entity1 asked his audience to imagine the beginning of the @entity4 is like the @entity132 , with the role of time being played by degrees of latitude			1
just as asking what is south of the @entity132 makes no sense , he argued , to asking what happened before the beginning of the @entity4 would become a meaningless question			2
@entity1 at @entity17 moreover , conceiving of the @entity4 in this way also removes ' age - old objections ' to the idea that the @entity4 had a beginning ; that it would be a place where the normal laws of physics could not hold			1
instead , @entity1 claimed , the beginning of the @entity4 could be governed by laws of science , which justifies a picture he and fellow physicist @entity152 developed as like the formation of bubbles of steam in boiling water			1
this claims that the most probably history of the @entity4 is like the surface of such bubbles , a few of which grow to such a size that they are safe from collapsing			0
' they will correspond to universes that would start off expanding at an ever increasing rate ' like the expanding @entity4 we live in , he said			2
the wonders of space : a picture from the @entity170			0
@entity1 said the observations of an expanding galaxy made by the astronomer after which the telescope is made refuted the idea the universe had no beginning quantum theory could best understand how the state of the @entity4 at the initial point of its formation gave rise to the @entity4 we live in today 13.5billion years after the @entity2 , @entity1 claimed			1
he said : ' general relativity on its own can not answer the central question in cosmology : why is the universe the way it is ? ' however , if general relativity is combined with quantum theory , it may be possible to predict how the universe would start			1
' small fluctuations in the initial state of the @entity4 would lead to the formation of ' galaxies , stars , and all the other structure in the universe , ' he said			0
his theory could be tested when science develops the ability to detect gravitational waves by accurately measuring the distance between spacecraft			0
these waves , he said , originated in the earliest times of the universe and have not been altered by their interactions by ' intervening material '			0
@entity1 , now 71 , has been battling degenerative motor - neurone disease related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or @entity217 's disease , for more than 50 years			0
his works of popular science have acheived great success , despite the arcane nature of the cosmology he investigates			0
a @entity37 stayed on the @entity78 best - seller list for a record breaking 237 weeks			0
he has been spending a month at @entity17 , as he does every year , always drawing huge crowds to hear him speak .			0

quantum theory and general relativity combined could best explain the beginning of the @entity4 , @entity1 tells audience at @entity17
eager science fans began queuing 12 hours before the start of the lecture for a chance to see him in person
