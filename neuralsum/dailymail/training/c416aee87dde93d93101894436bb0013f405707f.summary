a top secret document revealed by @entity4 whistleblower @entity10 shows the agency monitored suspected radicalizers in a bid to harm their reputations			1
six targets , all @entity16 , are identified as ' exemplars ' of how electronic surveillance can be used to find ' personal vulnerabilities ' to discredit them			0
the document revealed by @entity10 says evidence of ' viewing sexually explicit material online ' could call into question a radicaliser 's devotion to the jihadist cause the document says none of the six individuals targeted by the @entity4 is accused of being involved in terror plots and all are believed to currently reside outside the @entity32 among the vulnerabilities listed by the @entity4 that can be exploited are ' viewing sexually explicit material online ' and ' using sexually explicit persuasive language when communicating with inexperienced young girls '			1
the @entity4 document , dated october 3 , 2012 , repeatedly refers to the power of charges of hypocrisy to undermine such a messenger , the @entity37 reported			2
the document says : ' a previous @entity44 [ signals intelligence , the interception of communications ] assessment report on radicalization indicated that radicalizers appear to be particularly vulnerable in the area of authority when their private and public behaviors are not consistent			0
' the director of the @entity4 is listed as the ' originator ' of the document which lists recipients including officials at the @entity32 @entity59 and the @entity60			2
@entity61 , director of public affairs for @entity63 , told @entity37 : ' without discussing specific individuals , it should not be surprising that the @entity66 uses all of the lawful tools at our disposal to impede the efforts of valid terrorist targets who seek to harm the nation and radicalize others to violence			0

top secret document reveals how the @entity4 tried to discredit suspected radicalisers the top secret document was revealed by @entity4 whistleblower @entity10 ( pictured ) @entity82 , deputy legal director of the @entity83 , said : ' it 's important to remember that the @entity4 ’s surveillance activities are anything but narrowly focused - the agency is collecting massive amounts of sensitive information about virtually everyone			1
' ' wherever you are , the @entity4 's databases store information about your political views , your medical history , your intimate relationships and your activities online , ' he added			2
' the @entity4 says this personal information wo n't be abused , but these documents show that the @entity4 probably defines ' abuse ' very narrowly			0
' the director of the @entity4 is listed as the ' originator ' of the document which lists recipients including officials at the @entity32 @entity59 and the @entity60 revelations : the @entity4 headquarters in @entity110 , @entity111 none of the six individuals targeted by the @entity4 is accused in the document of being involved in terror plots and all are believed to currently reside outside the @entity32			1
only one is described as a ' @entity32 person , ' which means he is either a @entity32 citizen or a permanent resident and therefore entitled to greater legal protections against @entity4 surveillance than foreigners			1
