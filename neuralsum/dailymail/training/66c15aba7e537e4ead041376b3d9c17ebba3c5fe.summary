by @entity0 a skydiver beat the sweltering summer heat by landing on a 200ft slip - n - slide			2
experienced jumper @entity4 decided to cool off after leaping out of a @entity6 as it cruised over @entity8 , at 5,000ft			1
the fearless parachuter made a near vertical descent as he approached the giant water slide - before landing perfectly on his bum to slide the full length at around 50mph			1
he said : ' the weather was very hot and we were trying to figure out a fun way to cool off in between jumps			0
' it was a great way to end the day			0
' alongside fellow skydiver @entity28 , the pair can be seen smiling at the camera as they wait their turn to jump mr @entity4 , who has over 8,000 jumps behind him and runs a flight school in the states , captured the entire jump on a @entity20 attached to his helmet showing no sign of nerves having completed nearly 20,000 jumps between them , the professional skydivers nonchalantly leap out - despite being just 5,000ft above the ground the normal height for a skydive is roughly 13,000ft			1
it meant they had to pertorm a tricky ' hop and pop ' routine where they immediately pull their parachute after free falling for only a few seconds			0

@entity4 added : ' this type of landing has a higher risk associated with it because of the high decent rate and additional speed produced when diving the parachute			2
' it is by no means a normal parachute landing and takes many thousands of jumps and years to learn			0
