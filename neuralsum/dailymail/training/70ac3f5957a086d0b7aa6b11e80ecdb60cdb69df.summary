forty - seven million years ago , a pregnant mare drank from a lake that may have poisoned her with its deadly volcanic gases			2
now , her remarkably well - preserved body has been recovered by palaeontologists working in the @entity7 , a former coal , in @entity9 , @entity10			1
the fossilised remains of the mare and her unborn foal are providing scientists with new insights into these ancient creatures			1
forty - seven million years ago , a pregnant mare drank from a lake that may have poisoned her with its deadly volcanic gases			0
now , her remarkably well - preserved body has been recovered by palaeontologists working in the @entity7 , a former coal , in @entity9 , @entity10			1
the ringed area shows her unborn foal they reveal that , despite great differences in their size and shape , ancient horses had very similar reproduction to modern horses			1
these ancient creatures , known as @entity33 had four toes on each forefoot and three toes on each the hind foot , and it was about the size of a modern fox terrier			2
' almost all of the bones of the foetus are still articulated in their original position			0
only the skull is crushed , ' said dr @entity46 of the @entity47 , lead author of the study			0
the specimen was discovered by a team from the @entity47 nearly 15 years ago , but its extent was not fully appreciated until it was studied using micro x-ray			1
these ancient creatures , known as @entity33 had four toes on each forefoot and three toes on each the hind foot , and it was about the size of a modern fox terrier			2
artist 's impression pictured the micro x-ray analysis revealed a structure known as the broad ligament that connects the uterus to the backbone and helps support the developing foal			1
remnants of the wrinkled outer uterine wall became visible after the specimen was prepared , a feature shared between @entity70 and modern horses			1
the specimen was well - preserved due to the oil shales at @entity7 , which have long been known for their intricate fossils			1
modern racehorses are virtually all descended from a legendary @entity78 stallion called @entity79 ( artist 's impression pictured ) modern racehorses are virtually all descended from a legendary @entity78 stallion called @entity79 , a study confirmed last year			2
researchers found racehorses have far less variability of male chromosomes than other domestic animals do			0
they also confirmed that almost all @entity87 contain dna from the famous stallion @entity79			0
it has long been known that the female dna – mitochondrial dna – in modern horses is extremely diverse but , until recently , essentially no sequence diversity had been detected on the y chromosome – the male @entity88 - of the domestic horse			1
foaled during and named after the solar eclipse of 1 april 1764 , @entity79 was an undefeated 18th - century @entity78 thoroughbred racehorse who won 18 races , including 11 @entity100			0
@entity79 's descendants include @entity102 and @entity103 and almost all thoroughbred racehorses			0
these oil shales formed at the bottom of ancient @entity107 and preserve the remains of mammals , birds , and other animals that were living near what is now @entity9 , @entity10 about 47 million years ago			1
no oxygen was present at the bottom of the lake when the dead animals sank down and finally became embedded in the muddy sediments			0
pictured is a comparison between a modern day horse and the @entity70 which lived 47 million years ago there , anaerobic bacteria immediately began to decompose skin , muscles , and other soft tissues			2
as a result , the bacteria produced carbon dioxide , which in turn precipitated iron ions present in the lake water			0
as a result , the organ was not fossilised directly , but is visible as a dark shadow left by bacteria that consumed the tissue and then were fossilised			0
the size of the fetus and the presence of fully developed milk teeth indicate that it was close to term when it and its mother died			0
but its position in the uterus indicates that the two did not die during the birthing process			2
the fetus was upside down rather than right side up , and its front legs were not yet extended as they should be just before birth			0
this is only the second example of a fossil where the placenta can be identified , researchers claim			1
the fossil was preserved in the oil shales at @entity7 in @entity9 , close to @entity158 in @entity10			1

@entity160 was preserved in the oil shales at @entity7 in @entity9
micro x-ray analysis revealed a structure known as the broad ligament
it connects uterus to the backbone and helps support developing foal
it is only second example of fossil where placenta can be identified
it reveals early horses had a similar reproduction to modern horses
