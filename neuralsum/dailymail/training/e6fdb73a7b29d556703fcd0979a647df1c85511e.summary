by @entity0 published : 18:04 est , 20 october 2013 updated : 06:57 est , 21 october 2013 @entity2 mp @entity1 will address @entity3 tomorrow in the debate about the @entity6 's future the @entity9 licence fee is a ‘ medieval anachronism ’ and can only be justified if those who pay it elect the chairman and board , have a more direct say on programme - making and an input on celebrity pay , mps will hear today			1
@entity2 mp @entity1 will argue the licence fee is a ‘ coercive system backed up by the threat of fines and prison ’ in a backbench business committee debate on the @entity6 ’s future			1
mr @entity1 believes the fact that fee - payers have little input into how @entity6 is run makes the @entity9 as undemocratic as a ‘ feudal monarchy			1
’ a debate in parliament on the @entity6 ’s future will hear that public trust in the @entity9 has been eroded by the @entity31 and severance pay scandals			0
the debate will hear that in order to win back public trust , the licence fee should be reformed so fee payers are treated like shareholders in a business they have invested in			1
under proposals , mr @entity1 will suggest today people who pay the £ 145.50 a year licence fee should be allowed a vote on both the election of the chairman and the board			1
they would have some say over the annual report , programme making and celebrity pay , and the ability to call for board members who have ‘ grown out of touch with public opinion ’ to be sacked			0
while there is a statutory requirement to consult its licence fee payers , mr @entity1 said this process is in reality a ‘ sham ’ as most of the decisions they are consulted on , are made well in advance			1
the mp calls for a new system whereby the public are able to cast a vote online using a unique pin number , as a cheap way to ‘ democratise ’ the @entity9 for viewers and listeners			2
@entity9 director general @entity69 , pictured at the @entity6 's headquarters , may come under fire in today 's debate he said it would also help to ‘ spark a genuine debate - a battle of ideas - about the kind of @entity9 that we want , and how it should spend our money ’			0
' the @entity9 is monopolistic , with about a third of tv viewing and half of radio , it is often branded as anti-competitive because it does not have to make a commercial return on its products , and the licence fee is a mediaeval anachronism ’ , he told the @entity89			2
large staff payouts , such as those revealed by head of @entity93 , are cause for concern says @entity1 ' some might feel that the licence fee is a regressive tax which penalises those on low incomes			1
' others will be upset by the salaries of senior @entity9 executives and celebrities			0
‘ the reality is that licence fee payers want choice			1
some might want a beefed - up @entity108 , paid for by reducing expense elsewhere - perhaps by cutting the £ 50,000 a day that the @entity9 spends on taxis			0
‘ at the moment we are powerless ' he said , adding : ' as licence fee payers , we are compelled to pay our dues , and if we do not like that , our only choice is to abandon tv altogether			1
’ the @entity9 made £ 3.6billion from the licence fee in 2012/13			2
it emerged this year that 3,700 a week were prosecuted for not having a tv licence - around one in ten of all cases coming before the courts in @entity122 and @entity123			0
they face fines of £ 1,000 , compared with £ 80 spot fines handed to shoplifters , petty vandals and drunken yobs			0
it later emerged a private firm employed to catch licence fee evaders has hundreds of officers who can earn four - figure bonuses for them to court			2
yet @entity9 managers received £ 25milion in secret severance deals between 2009 and 2012 , and nearly £ 3million was paid over and above what they were entitled to in their contracts in the six years to 2012 , according to an official report this year			0
mr @entity1 will argue the @entity6 has lost its viewers ' trust in the wake of the @entity31 scandal a debate entitled ‘ the future of the @entity9 ’ will be held this afternoon in the @entity146 by the backbench business committee , which represents rank and file mps			1
mr @entity1 said it was no longer acceptable to argue that giving the public a say would result in dumbing down of content			0
‘ look at @entity154 and @entity155 ’ , he said			0
‘ the @entity9 can not continue - dare i say it - to be a kleptocracy , indifferent to the public who pay for it			0
‘ @entity9 pays out huge salaries to executives and celebrities alike			0
her undemocratic licence fee has become an anachronism in the days of multi-channel satellite television			2
‘ if the @entity9 really does depend on the licence fee for its survival , then there must be some genuine checks and balances			2
what better way than democratising the licence fee ? ’ ‘ it would be similar to shareholders having the ability to hire and fire their board , but with one main difference - every licence fee payer would hold just one share and one vote			1

@entity1 feels viewers should have more say in @entity6
@entity2 mp will argue the licence fee is ' coercive system backed by the threat of prison '
new proposals suggest licence fee payers should be able to vote on election of chairman and board
