mr @entity19 said they ‘ drew upon rocket science used in spacecraft to create a wholly down - to - @entity26 cooking experience			0
’ for example , the materials and the structural design were selected specifically to optimise heat flow , while the device can cook food to very precise specifications			1
‘ like controlling the motion of a satellite , @entity3 ’s predictive control system and sensor placement are carefully tuned to avoid overshoot , ’ the company said			0
dimensions : 18 x 12 x 5 inches ( 46 x 30 x 13cm ) weight : 12 lbs ( 5kg ) electric : @entity44 at @entity45 @entity46 ( 550 ° f ) connectivity : @entity48 and @entity49 mr @entity19 said the product enables people to ‘ combine the best parts of home cooking - the creative and sensory experience - with the best part of fine dining , which is the perfectly cooked , delicious food			2

once cooked , the machine can then keep the food at its serving temperature for two hours			2
‘ because the temperature inside @entity3 is so precise and remains constant , it is impossible to overcook or undercook the steak , ’ the company claimed			0
' to monitor the temperature of the food , @entity3 uses a ‘ patent - pending virtual - thermometer algorithm			0
’ @entity3 is available now for pre-order , and will begin shipping in early 2016			0
