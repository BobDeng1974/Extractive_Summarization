by @entity0 by the time @entity4 children reach the age of 15 , they are already languishing three years behind their @entity7 equivalents in maths			1
it is just one marker of how the @entity12 city is racing ahead of @entity4 – and the rest of the world			1
@entity7 is top of the international league table in maths , reading and science for the second time			1
the city triumphed despite spending just 60 per cent of the international average on education – $ 49,000 ( £ 29,852 ) over a pupil ’s lifetime compared to the average of $ 83,382 ( £ 50,793 )			1
hard work : many of @entity7 's pupils study for nine hours a day in @entity4 , the spending per pupil is $ 98,023 ( £ 59,719 ) – yet the investment does not bear fruit			1
the disparity in academic standing can not be blamed on large class sizes , as the average number of pupils in @entity7 ’s nearly 3,000 state schools is 35.4 , compared with 25 in the @entity4			1
the key difference between @entity7 and @entity4 appears to be pushy parents – and even pushier teachers			1
in the @entity12 city , 45.9 per cent of parents got in touch with teachers to discuss school performance compared with 18.9 per cent in the @entity4			1
this was also the case in other top performing countries such as @entity48 and @entity49			0
the teachers also phone parents regularly , telling them how to improve their parenting as well as checking on how hard the children are working at home			0
pressure and expectation seem to bear results – 80 per cent of @entity7 ’s 1.8million pupils enter higher education			1
@entity48 claimed 17th place in the league tables despite spending much less than @entity4			1
the average number of children in a class is 41 , making a mockery of the idea that education depends on low pupil - teacher ratios			1
@entity48 had the highest proportion of parents – 49.2 per cent – who got in touch with teachers to check on their child ’s progress			2
the @entity80 ’s @entity79 , in charge of the @entity78 tests , highlighted @entity48 ’s ‘ star performance ’ in its first appearance in the international tables			1
it was in the top ten for science and outperformed many much wealthier western education systems , including the @entity88			2
@entity89 performing high school students in @entity48 are expected to study additional courses and parents often use tutors to help children at underfunded state schools			2
the average monthly salary of state teachers is between £ 35 and £ 60 a day , so many supplement their income with private tuition			2
@entity4 spends 14 times as much as @entity48 on each pupil			2
@entity103 ’s pupils also outperform their @entity4 equivalents in every subject area , despite it spending $ 55,520 or £ 33,824.78 , around half of what the @entity4 spends on education			1
but it had just 20.6 pupils per class			0
the ‘ pushy parent ’ effect could be a result of @entity12 ’s one child policy or perhaps the fact that 80 per cent of @entity7 ’s youngsters have some form of private tuition in addition to mainstream schooling			1
other reasons for the city ’s success include the intensive training given to teachers throughout their careers and a culture of sharing and competition in the classroom			0
most children spend long hours in school , studying in bursts , before continuing with plenty of homework and extra-curricular activities later			0
the @entity80 study said : ‘ top performers , notably in @entity141 , place great emphasis on selecting and training teachers , encourage them to work together and prioritise investment in teacher quality not classroom sizes			0
‘ they also set clear targets and give teachers autonomy in the classroom			0
children whose parents have higher expectations perform better			0
’ @entity79 , the @entity80 ’s education expert , added : ‘ teachers call up parents at least fortnightly – they ring them on their mobile to check on how their children are working			0
they also tell them how to improve their parenting			0
‘ the pupils in @entity7 have agile , mobile schools and a lot of parental pressure			0
’ the length of the academic day varies between schools , but having children work for nine hours is not uncommon			0
classes are highly selective and competition is actively encouraged			0
mr @entity79 said the system is intensely meritocratic , adding : ‘ if you are better than others , you ’re going to get better chances			0
that ’s the underlying belief			0
’ however , while @entity7 and @entity177 , which also performed well , are @entity12 ’s economic power - houses , the results for the rest of the country are likely to be much more patchy			2
figures for the whole of @entity12 were not submitted for the @entity80 survey			2
@entity7 ’s teachers are paid relatively modest salaries but have the incentive of 30 per cent of their earnings being based on performance			0
falling behind : @entity4 teenagers are lagging behind their @entity12 counterparts			1

@entity12 pupils are racing ahead of their @entity4 counterparts in school league tables
the city topped the table despite spending just 60 per cent of international average on education
