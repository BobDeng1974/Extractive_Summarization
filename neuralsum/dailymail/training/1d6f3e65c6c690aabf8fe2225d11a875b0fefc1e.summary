a stoppage time goal from captain @entity2 handed @entity5 ’s @entity4 side a vital win , and leaves their qualification hopes for the quarter finals of the @entity9 in their own hands			1
in a game lacking quality , @entity2 ’s last - gasp winner was the only notable shot on target , but it was enough to secure a crucial three points			2
the former @entity19 striker , who had been largely disappointing until he burst past the @entity21 defence in the 92nd minute to finish past @entity22 , was back in the team after a bout of @entity25			0
@entity2 ( left ) shoots to score in the final seconds of @entity4 's game against @entity27 @entity2 celebrates , while team - mate - @entity29 youngster @entity28 - is seen behind @entity4 : @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 55 ) , @entity39 , @entity40 ( @entity41 78 ) , @entity42 ( @entity43 84 ) , @entity2 subs not used : @entity28 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 goal : @entity2 90 +2 booked : @entity37 26 @entity27 : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity60 71 ) , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 87 ) , @entity65 , @entity66 ( @entity67 56 ) subs not used : @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 booked : @entity56 45 +1 , @entity65 73 referee : @entity79 but despite his captain 's lack of threat throughout the game , @entity5 left him on the field , and was rewarded seconds from time			1
up until that point @entity2 had n’t looked at all fit , and for a player who possesses as much pace and skill as he does , it was notable that he did n’t get in behind the @entity21 defence for the first time until after more than an hour had been played			0
on that occasion , he fired a tame effort , which would n’t have given @entity96 any trouble even if had been on target , well wide			0
@entity2 ’s return also meant that @entity100 , dangerous in bursts on tuesday , was wasted playing behind his captain – when the @entity103 forward moved alongside @entity2 in the second half the @entity4 were significantly more positive			2
having lost to a late goal against @entity106 , the @entity4 knew they could not afford another defeat against the pre-tournament favourites , and a draw would have meant hoping for other results to go their way			1
tempers flared between @entity4 and @entity27 during the @entity114 match in @entity115 @entity4 defender @entity33 ( left ) intervenes as @entity65 ( second left ) argues with @entity36 @entity36 ( centre ) is pushed by @entity117 midfielder @entity65 ( left ) and forward @entity66 ( right ) but both sides offered very little going forward , with neither keeper making a save of note for 90 minutes			1
after a dire first half , @entity4 did try and play some more attacking football in the second period , but the closest they came to a goal before @entity2 ’s winner was when @entity100 met his brother @entity126 ’s cross with a clever flick that flew over the bar , while @entity2 also saw a header flash across the face of goal			2
in the absence of striker @entity67 , left out of the starting line - up despite scoring against @entity135 , @entity27 switched to a 4 - 4 - 2 , with @entity63 pushed on alongside @entity66 , and @entity117 ’s @entity65 moving to the left side of midfield			1
the @entity139 foxes dominated possession , but their passing lacked any sort of penetration , while @entity4 were happy to sit back and play on the break			2
@entity4 's @entity32 ( left ) challenges @entity27 's midfielder @entity65 during the match in @entity115 neither side could break the deadlock in @entity148 until the final moments of the match the only opening before the break came after 20 minutes , when the @entity21 put together a neat passing move to release right back @entity154 , but his cut - back was sliced so badly by @entity65 that it ended up going out for a throw - in			1
things were not helped by the overly fussy referee @entity79 , who seemed to think that @entity66 needed only to look at the ball to be penalized , but in truth neither side showed anything like the level of quality needed to win the game			0
@entity166 ’s @entity60 was introduced midway through the second half , in attempt to reinvigorate the @entity21 attack , and he did manage to trouble the @entity4 defence soon after , but his shot was comfortably over the bar			0
it summed up a game which disappointed for 92 minutes , before @entity2 brought it to life			0
@entity63 ( centre ) is crowded out by @entity33 ( left ) and @entity37 during the group match @entity32 wins a header ( left ) , while @entity65 ( far right ) is fouled by @entity33 ( second right )			0

@entity5 's @entity4 lost their first match 2 - 1 against @entity106
@entity27 defeated @entity135 3 - 1 in the first major upset of the tournament
neither team could break the deadlock for the *majority* of the match
in the final minute , @entity2 netted to steal the game for @entity4
@entity5 's men now sit level second going into the final group match
