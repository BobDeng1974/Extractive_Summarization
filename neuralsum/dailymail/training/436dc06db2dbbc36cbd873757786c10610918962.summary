' by @entity11 last updated at 7:53 am on 6th december 2011 she 's a picture of professionalism when on duty as a judge during @entity16 's @entity17			2
but normally cool and composed @entity18 lost control a little after she was offered a glass of wine on @entity23 's @entity22 last night			0
as she worked her way through the rest of the bottle , the star offered her - extremely frank - thoughts on @entity17 romances , the @entity8 , and whether dancers are better in bed over the course of the rambunctious interview			1
loosening up : normally cool and composed @entity18 lost control a little after she was offered a glass of wine on @entity23 's @entity22 last night with @entity17 fellow judges @entity38 and @entity39 things kicked off when @entity41 accepted @entity23 's offer of a rosé , quipping ' oh if you twist my arm ' , before admitting ' i 'm anybodies after two glasses			0
' @entity18 took her generous helping with a civilised ' that looks lovely ' , while @entity38 demurred ' if it 's the rosé '			0
however things took a turn for the tipsy when @entity18 let the boys shoulder most of the burden at the start of the interview , sipping steadily away as she sat between them			0
the first sign of high spirits came when @entity23 asked the threesome how close they were to getting @entity62 onto the show			0
can i tempt you ? everyone on @entity23 's sofa was keen to quench their thirst @entity18 emitted a gleeful cackle , leaning back into the chair before agreeing enthusiastically to @entity41 's suggestion that @entity23 should appear on @entity17			0
@entity18 admitted that she thought a ' boy could win this year ' , candidly saying ' the reality is , all the girls really like @entity76			1
' when @entity23 said that he felt sorry for aging dancer @entity77 , who 'd nearly finished her tall glass of wine within a few minutes - interrupted with ' i do n't ' before bursting into yet more giggles			1
getting into her stride : @entity18 drank the bulk of her first glass within minutes she then plunged into juicier territory , declaring : ' everybody is really frisky on the show though , you 've got to be honest			0
' she continued : ' everybody is horny - the year i was a contestant everyone was really gagging for it ' - at which point @entity41 removed her now empty glass from her hand , exclaiming ' no more drink for you ! ' @entity23 gasped ' this is chat show gold ! ' , frantically grabbing the bottle to refill her glass			1
going to your head ? @entity18 was unable to stop laughing as her wine took effect two steps ahead , @entity18 snapped ' give me the bottle ' - seizing it with one hand and taking a long swig - lasting several seconds			1
as @entity41 and @entity38 collapsed with laughter @entity18 picked up where the conversation had left off			0
the audience still clapping , she ploughed on : ' as i was saying , eight to ten hours a day , rubbing up next to each other , of course you 're going to get a bit frisky ! ' take it away ! @entity41 removed @entity18 's glass as things started getting rowdier @entity23 then pointed at @entity41 , exclaiming ' look , he 's touching himself ! ' - to which the @entity125 replied : ' i ca n't help it , she gets me going ! ' @entity41 then commented on @entity18 's claim , saying ' i 've done it for nine years and i 've never seen any boner			1
' @entity18 immediately rebuffed him , saying ' dancing is a very flirtatious sexual thing			1
every year somebody gets together ! ' ' this is chat show gold ! ' : @entity23 could n't wait to pour @entity18 another glass as her answers became increasingly graphic she then contradicted herself , backtracking ' well no - one this year , although there 's always a rumour			1
i 've not heard anyone this year			2
' @entity23 then asked them whether they thought that good dancers are better in bed - to which @entity18 enthusiastically replied : ' well i should think so @entity23 ! ' at this , @entity41 removed the ( nearly empty ) bottle from her hand , and @entity23 showed the group a unbelievably raunchy clip from the @entity153 version of @entity17			0
throwing herself into the debate : @entity18 said that the problem with x factor is ' they focus too much on the drama , and everything else other the singing ' his tipsiest guest was stunned into a brief moment of calm by the sight of contestants across the pond gyrating naked on stage , but it was n't long before she was back on exuberant form			2
when @entity23 mentioned @entity8 , @entity18 gave a little victory jiggle , before diplomatically commenting ' i do n't understand why we ca n't just enjoy both shows , i actually do n't think the public give a sh * *			1
it 's the producers and the media			0
the public will just sky plus one and watch it later , they do n't care			1
' @entity23 commended her saying ' i ca n't believe @entity18 's become the voice of reason after a whole bottle of wine ! ' rude not to ! @entity18 enthusiastically accepted @entity23 's offer of the whole bottle he may have spoken too soon however , as @entity18 continued ' the problem is @entity195 , they focus too much on the drama , and everything else other the singing			2
' @entity23 intercepted with ' you see at this point you 've crossed the line from being a fun drunk to a violent one '			0
@entity18 took this in good humour , laughing uproariously once again before excusing herself ' you know what it is , i just feel like i 'm at home with my mates having a gossip '			0
telling it like it is : when @entity23 asked whether dancers are better in bed @entity18 immediately replied ' well i should think so @entity23 ! ' she then added : ' it 's swings and roundabouts , next year they 'll be beating us , the year after we 'll beat them , who cares ! @entity225 on @entity226			2
' at this @entity41 laughed ' if you ca n't beat them , join them , and downed his own drink			2
a more bashful @entity18 later took to @entity231 to excuse her uncharacteristic behaviour			0
she wrote : ' apologies for being pickled on @entity23 ! i did have fun though ! ' ' i am officially a light weight and clearly a cheap date ! ! ! : ) xxx '			0

said that the year she was a contestant ' everyone was really gagging for it . '
