by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 07:16 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 09:43 est , 8 january 2013 on a frozen windswept hill on the outskirts of @entity1 , half a dozen @entity3 men broke the icy ground with pick axes			1
nearby , the body of eighteen - month - old @entity9 lay wrapped in a plain blanket , her pale face glowing in the gold winter sun. all morning her mother and aunts had washed her remains and prayed over her , in keeping with @entity18 tradition			1
now the men and boys took responsibility for her final journey			1
heartbreaking : the tiny body of eighteen - month - old @entity9 is carried to her final resting place after she froze to death in a refugee camp in @entity1 killed by the cold floor : @entity9 's father , @entity28 , tried to wake his daughter , but she was not breathing			1
he said he was not able to afford a decent stove or the fuel @entity9 ’s father , @entity32 , crouched nearby			1
inconsolable , he was supported physically and emotionally by her uncle			2
in between the sobbing and tears , he said : ' yesterday she was ok			2
she had a little cough and i took her to the doctor			2
' she even spoke children ’s words to him			2
when she went to sleep she was fine			2
this morning , i went to check on her , she was under her blanket by the wood burner			2
' i went to shake her awake and she was not breathing			2
i could not afford a decent wood stove or the fuel			1
the floor was too cold and this is what killed my daughter			1
she has taken her path and left us alone			2
' this is the nearest cemetery to the sprawling @entity57 refugee camp and this routine is sadly common during the coldest months			1
as the hole nears completion , a tribal elder draws my attention to a fresh grave next to it			2
@entity65 lay a three - year - old boy called @entity67			2
also from the camp , he like @entity9 , died in his sleep from exposure			1
last goodbyes : @entity9 is tenderly wrapped in cloths and blankets ready for burial at a makeshift cemetery sombre : @entity3 men and women gather by the burial ground , the nearest cemetery to the sprawling @entity57 refugee camp , where around 90 per cent of residents have fled from the fighting in @entity83 as the men completed the digging , two dozen more gathered in lines to say prayers for the little girl before gently lowering her into her tomb			1
a large piece of slate was placed over her shrouded remains before the dirt and pebbles were returned to the earth			2
finally the mound had two upright stones placed at either end			2
a cloth was tied between them to discourage birds from landing on the grave			2
animals are not welcome in the resting places of such deeply superstitious people			2
we gave @entity107 and his brother a lift back to the camp			1
upon arrival , we navigated the narrow passageways in between the huts to reach the mosque			0
the recent snow had melted quite suddenly turning the streets into sludge			0
barely distinguishable from the network of open sewers , that ran through their centre			0
temporary undertakers : around half a dozen men used pick axes to dig the grave out of the icy groind on a frozen windswept hill just outside @entity1 regrettable ritual : as the men completed the digging , two dozen more gathered in lines to say prayers for the little girl before gently lowering her into her tomb the mud brick buildings of the camp have multiplied year after year since the first tents were pitched eight years ago			1
at present the @entity139 estimates that over 1,000 families reside here			1
local people in @entity1 treat them with suspicion			1
unlike other internally displaced @entity144 , the people of @entity57 are brought here directly by the war rather than the more common land disputes			0
ninety percent of the residents come from @entity83 province			1
the rest , from @entity150			1
hailing from the sun burnt fields of the south these people fair particularly badly in the bitter @entity1 winter			1
as we strode towards the heart of the camp , burka - clad women passed by us			1
usually they would be out of sight hidden from view by deep - set traditions			0
but today @entity162 were operating their tent health clinic so sick children were being brought there in their droves by anxious mothers			0
the queue for the facility stretched back into the twisting lanes of the city of mud			0
other children congregated near two larger tents			0
too common a sight : this routine is sadly a regular occurrence during the coldest months fleeing violence : those attending the funeral live at the sprawling @entity57 refugee camp , which currently accommodates around 1,000 families there are around 460,000 displaced people in @entity144 , according to the @entity187 charity			1
in @entity1 alone , there are 55 informal camps , home to more than 30,000 people , including 5,208 families			1
an estimated 70 per cent of the @entity144 population live in poverty			0
the camps in @entity1 sprung up spontaneously when displaced people arrived in the capital looking for help , and are not formally run by any agency , although charities like @entity187 provide assistance			1
children under five are most vulnerable to the cold , especially if they are already weakened by malnutrition and poor health			1
last year , more than 40 children died from the cold in one month alone			1
earlier they had attended lessons in two makeshift schools housed in marquees another service provided by @entity139			1
the boys and girls of the camp get a basic education in strict segregation from each other			1
more composed now , @entity28 poured us tea at the entrance to the @entity221			1
he was in his late 20s but looked much older			0
when asked how his family came to be in @entity1 , he replied : ' we are not here for sightseeing			1
we left @entity83 because of the fighting , also there was no work and we have no land			1
' if you carry an @entity232 card and the @entity233 stop you , they will claim that you are a spy for the government			0
' if the police find you without one , they will arrest you on suspicion of being @entity233 or @entity237			0
i do n’t care who is in charge whether the government or the @entity233 as long as we have peace			0
' asked if he would return if the fighting ceased following the withdrawal of foreign troops in 2014 , his answer was surprising			0
' there is no point in going back there , ' he said			0
' there is no work except smuggling , or selling drugs , i can not do this			0
even the work here is better			0
' displaced : unlike other internally displaced @entity144 , the people of @entity57 are brought here directly by the war rather than the more common land disputes superstition : finally the mound had two upright stones placed at either end with a cloth tied between them to discourage birds from landing on the grave like most men from the displacement camps he relied on casual labouring work from the market places around @entity1 , though work was rare and poorly paid			1
he said : ' each morning i get up early and go to @entity277 ( a local labour market ) , if i find work , then i can earn around 200 afghanis ( $ 4 )			0
' it costs me one hundred to travel there and back so i am left with just one hundred to support my family			0
from this i must buy food , firewood , tea and medicine			0
' to add to the desperation of @entity288 and other men in his position , much of the work would dry up when the snow arrived in the coming weeks			0
building sites can not operate when the roads are impassable , so their meagre income would wither just as the weather was at its cruellest			0
he concluded with a plea to the government : ' we have lived in this poverty now for five years			0
' these living conditions are not suitable for animals			0
we are tired of moving around we demand and end to the war and a permanent place to live			0
' they should be like our parents , instead they neglect us			0
' his brother snorted and added : ' they think we are stupid			0
we know that other countries are sending us money for the things we need			0
but they are stealing it from us			0
that is why my niece is dead			0

@entity9 froze to death because father could *n't* afford decent heater
father @entity28 said : ' the floor was too cold . this is what killed my daughter '
her body was laid to rest in makeshift cemetery near refugee camp in @entity1
the camp is home to 1,000 families who have escaped violence in @entity83
