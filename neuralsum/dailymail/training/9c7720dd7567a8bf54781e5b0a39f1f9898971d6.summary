a @entity1 health economist who made national headlines last year for talking about ' the stupidity of the @entity5 voter ' was a target monday in a report from the @entity9 state auditor saying the economist may have padded his bills to the state			1
auditor of @entity14 said he referred his findings on @entity16 and his contract with the state to attorney general @entity19			2
@entity20 said @entity16 's invoices billed @entity9 $ 100 per hour for the work of a research assistant – 1,000 hours in 10 weeks			1
' to do so , the @entity25 would have worked exclusively on this project for more than 14 hours per day – every day , ' the auditor said			2
if the assistant worked monday through friday , it would amount to 20 hours per day , with just four hours left over to eat and sleep			1
' the attorney general said in an interview that @entity20 raised ' serious questions			0
' @entity16 said in an email monday to the @entity54 that he did not wish to comment			0
the @entity1 economist got $ 392,600 from the @entity57 for his @entity30 consulting , records show			1
the @entity59 paid him another $ 2 million for @entity61 consulting , and the @entity62 has compensated him to the tune of $ 1.7 million for ' expert witness testimony			0
' four @entity5 states , including @entity9 , contracted with him for another $ 1.6 million in consuting work for advice about health care laws			1
an adviser to the @entity71 administration on the federal @entity30 , @entity16 told groups in 2012 and 2013 that voter stupidity and a ' lack of transparency ' were important to passing the hard - fought legislation			1
he has apologized repeatedly for his comments , saying they were uninformed , ' glib , thoughtless and sometimes downright insulting			0
' @entity9 administration secretary @entity79 said monday the two state officials working with @entity16 , @entity81 and @entity82 , were in contact with him frequently enough – sometimes multiple times a day – to monitor his work			1
still , @entity79 said he is urging staff to step up contract vigilance , and he agreed with @entity20 's criticism that @entity16 's invoices need more detail			2
he said state officials had assumed @entity16 had multiple assistants working with him , but later learned there was just one			2
' we feel that the work was done , but clearly it would have been better if we had documented that and they had documented that , ' @entity79 said			0
@entity20 said the round numbers in @entity16 's invoices were a red flag			0
red flags : billing for a research assistant to work 1,000 hours over 10 weeks – an exact number that seemed unrealistic and also ' rounded ' – got @entity16 in trouble ' it is noteworthy that dr. @entity16 's first invoice reported round numbers of hours worked ( 100 for mr. @entity16 and 500 for the research assistants ) , ' @entity20 wrote			1
' this is possible , but unlikely			0
in addition , the second invoice reported exactly the same figures , which is implausible			0
' @entity9 contracted with @entity16 in july to do economic modeling for @entity116 , a universal , publicly - funded health care system that had been in development since the @entity119 passed and gov. @entity120 signed a bill in 2011 to create the system			1
@entity120 ended up pulling the plug on @entity116 in december , saying it would be too expensive			0
@entity79 said the state has paid $ 160,000 to date on what initially was a $ 450,000 contract , including $ 50,000 for a subcontractor .			0

@entity16 *famously* was caught on video saying that @entity30 became law because of ' the stupiditiy of the @entity5 voter '
the @entity1 economist is now *accused* of *inflating* his hours on a contract with the state of @entity9
@entity16 was *tasked* with creating an economic model that would show all the costs associated with a single - payer health *insurance* system
he billed the state for 1,000 hours of work by a research assistant over just 10 weeks – a rate of more than 20 hours for every weekday
