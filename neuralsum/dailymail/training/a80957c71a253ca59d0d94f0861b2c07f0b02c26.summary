' after digging for five hours , volunteers , experts from @entity39 and the @entity62 , the @entity63 and police found a small , 55 - inch wood casket containing what they believed are the girl 's remains , according to @entity70			1
tests : @entity9 's body was exhumed in an effort to finally identify her with modern technology and break the cold case lost : @entity9 's headstone , paid for by @entity77 , left , was placed on the wrong burial site , making her exhumation difficult her body was taken to the medical examiner 's office for dna tests after it was found , but it could take weeks before tests might shed light on grisly cold case			1

' i thought about her every time i drove by that cemetery			2
' the girl , known as ' @entity22 ' and ' @entity117 ' , was never identified			1

scientists will examine minerals in her bones to try to determine what part of the country she came from , but police think her killer was a local resident			0
' he had to be familiar with the area , ' @entity104 told @entity42			0
' it 's possible she was killed by a relative or someone she knew because her head was taken off			0
' ' but who knows what these killers think , ' @entity104 added			0
it could have been a stranger			0
' @entity104 , who was among those at the cemetery last week when the girl 's body was exhumed , said the sweater she was found in seemed to be new			1
