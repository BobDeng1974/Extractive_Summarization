warning : home secretary @entity0 will make an announcement on stop and search today @entity0 will today promise to change the law if police do not halt the ‘ excessive and inappropriate ’ use of stop and search			1
the home secretary will warn officers that she wants to see a dramatic improvement in figures showing that only one in every ten of the searches ends in arrest			1
if police continue to misuse the powers – which are disproportionately targeted against ethnic minorities – legislation will be introduced to tie their hands			2
mrs may will make the announcement when delivering this year ’s @entity21 , in memory of the murdered black teenager			2
stop and search has been blamed for inflaming tensions between the police – labelled ‘ institutionally racist ’ for their botched response to @entity29 ’s killing – and black people , in particular			1
in 2013 , a @entity32 officer was disciplined for discriminating against @entity29 ’s younger brother , @entity33 , who was followed and stopped while driving in his car			0
mr @entity35 – who said he had been targeted simply because of the colour of his skin - complained that he had been stopped or searched by officers on 25 occasions since the age of 17			0
a recent report by the police watchdog found more than a quarter of police stop and searches are ‘ unlawful ’ and risk promoting ‘ major disorder ’			1
' targeted ' : in 2013 , a @entity32 officer was disciplined for discriminating against @entity29 ’s younger brother , @entity33 ( pictured with his mother @entity50 ) , who was followed and stopped while driving in his car her majesty ’s @entity52 said that , in 27 per cent of cases , police failed to show they had reasonable grounds to carry out the search			1
it was the equivalent of 250,000 people every year being stopped and subjected to hugely intrusive searches without the police sticking to the rules			1
mrs may is expected to say that , during her time in office , she has heard ‘ accounts exposing the excessive and inappropriate use of stop and search			1
’ she will add of ' evidence that if you are black or from a minority ethnic background that you are up to seven times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than if you are white ’			1
stop and search : if police continue to misuse the powers - which are disproportionately targeted against ethnic minorities - legislation will be introduced to tie their hands ( file picture ) mrs may had originally wanted to legislate to curb the use of the powers in last year ’s @entity80 but was blocked by @entity81			1
murdered : @entity35 was stabbed to death at the age of 18 in an unprovoked racist attack at a bus stop in @entity86 , south - east @entity87 , in 1993 @entity88 was said to be keen to support police leaders who argue the search powers are a vital tool against knife crime and gang culture			1
in a compromise , she instead introduced a voluntary code to which every police force , including the @entity98 , has agreed			2
this includes a restriction on the so - called ‘ no suspicion ’ power , which allows officers to stop and search even when they do not suspect a crime has been committed			2
a chief police officer must now believe it is ‘ necessary ’ to authorise use of the power because violence ‘ will ’ take place			2
previously , use of the power could be authorised by a much more junior officer if they believed violence ‘ may ’ occur			0
forces now also have to record the outcome of searches in more detail , including if the suspect was arrested and charged			0
mrs may will tell the conference at @entity87 ’s @entity119 , which is supported by the @entity120 : ‘ it is my hope , expectation and objective that these steps will further reduce the number of stops and searches across @entity128 and @entity129 , as the use of these sensitive powers becomes properly targeted , based on reasonable grounds and accountable to citizens and communities			0
‘ but let me be absolutely clear : if stops and searches do not continue to fall , if the use of these powers does not become more targeted , and stop - to - arrests ratios do not improve , then a conservative @entity135 will not hesitate to bring in primary legislation to make it happen			2
’ @entity29 was stabbed to death at the age of 18 in an unprovoked racist attack at a bus stop in @entity86 , south - east @entity87 , in 1993			0
the public inquiry into his death accused @entity32 of being ‘ institutionally racist ’			0
the @entity120 campaigned to bring the killers to justice and published a landmark front page accusing five men of the murder			0
two of the men named – @entity35 and @entity35 – were eventually convicted of murder in 2012			0
last month , the @entity21 and the @entity120 announced two journalism scholarships			0
