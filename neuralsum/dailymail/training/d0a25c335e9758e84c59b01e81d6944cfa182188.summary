by @entity0 published : 17:48 est , 4 november 2012 updated : 04:27 est , 5 november 2012 the time it takes to diagnose dementia is to be slashed from 18 months to just three following a scientific breakthrough			1
@entity5 will this week announce the creation of a chain of brain clinics to end the agony of those who find out they have @entity12 ’s when it is too late for help			2
experts say early diagnosis will give those suffering from the early stages of dementia 18 months of extra independent living , transforming the lives of hundreds of thousands of vulnerable and elderly			1
needing treatment : thousands of dementia sufferers go without care because their condition goes undiagnosed more than 400,000 people in @entity28 are suffering from dementia but are denied the care and support they need because their condition is undiagnosed – in part because they have to wait a year and a half for it to be confirmed			1
but new technology , which will receive the prime minister ’s backing this thursday , will mean those suffering from memory loss or other potential symptoms will have their condition diagnosed in a sixth of the time			1
vow : prime minister @entity5 had pledged to preserve pensioners ' benefits for the lifetime of this parliament patients at risk will be able to do a series of tests on an @entity51 in the comfort of their local gp ’s office			2
in only ten minutes the software can determine the difference between people with normal and abnormal memory			1
those at risk would then be referred to an @entity61 brain health centre where they would have more extensive memory tests while hooked up to an mri scanner			2
a new computer program can detect signs of dementia such as brain shrinkage and damage to blood vessels that can affect memory			1
the results would be beamed back to the gp			0
the government is also investing in a series of mobile diagnostic clinics which will park outside gp surgeries , so people can be tested on their own doorstep			1
the rate of successful diagnosis is expected to double from 42 per cent at present to 80 per cent – a target set by mr @entity5 earlier this year when he launched a @entity80			1
the pm has pledged to launch a campaign against @entity12 ’s to match the war on @entity84 in the 1980s and 1990s			0
it is estimated that by 2020 there will be nearly one million people with dementia , rising from the current level of 670,000			1
mr @entity5 said last night : ‘ dementia is a devastating disease that puts enormous strain on people and their families			1
early intervention : six out of ten people living with dementia in the @entity28 currently have not received a diagnosis , research found			1
( posed by model ) ‘ prompt diagnosis makes an enormous difference to dementia sufferers			1
this ground - breaking work from @entity28 scientists and companies could change lives for the better and it underlines to the world that @entity28 is great for research and for business			1
’ the government is investing £ 39million in the pilot project via a fund called @entity115 that backs small and medium - sized businesses and universities to accelerate the development of most technologically - advanced healthcare			0
the first ‘ @entity123 ’ will be established at the @entity120 at @entity121 in @entity122			0
the mobile van will run trials in @entity126			0
if they are a success they will be rolled out nationwide			0
the @entity130 will support the project by ensuring the needs of patients and their carers are fully considered in the project , and by undertaking an initial impact assessment on the 200 patients assessed in the two trial @entity138			0
six out of ten people living with dementia in the @entity28 have not received a diagnosis			1
experts say the problem is that many people have never raised the problem with their gp , or may have been misdiagnosed , or are simply waiting for a diagnosis			1
the current way a patient is diagnosed with dementia is both unwieldy and lengthy			2
in fact , there is no set referral pathway for those who complain about memory problems to their gp			0
a doctor may ask the patient to come back in a few months , may put the problem down to old age , or may conduct a basic pencil and paper memory test			0
eventually a patient may be referred to a memory clinic , where other gps will identify whether a problem exists			0
at that point the patient may be diagnosed , may be sent for a brain scan , or may be referred to a psychiatrist or neurologist in a regional centre			0
guidelines mean patients should not wait more than 18 weeks for an appointment with a specialist , but high demand means it often takes much longer			0
once they have an appointment at a hospital – usually in a major city or specialist hospital – they could have to travel long distances to get there			0
usually the patient will then be given a memory test , and may , but not always , have an mri or ct scan			0
the test is assessed by a neurologist or a psychiatrist			0
any brain scans are assessed by a radiologist , who uses their expertise to judge whether there is a problem			0
at that point the patient may get a diagnosis			2
the whole process from start to finish can take up to 18 months			0
under the proposed system , any patient with memory problems will be given a ten - minute test by a gp , using newly developed software on an @entity51			0
it will immediately identify whether a patient is at risk of dementia			2
they hope the proposed system will make diagnoses quicker and more accurate – and the ease and access to scanners will mean people are not put off seeking help			2
the @entity219 charity says earlier diagnosis allows those with dementia to plan ahead while they still have the capacity , and crucially , make decisions about their own care			1
early interventions can also allow doctors to improve cognitive function , treat depression and delay institutionalisation – giving a patient more time to live independently			0
high blood pressure and a lack of exercise have also been linked to the onset of the dementia , and researchers are investigating whether early changes to lifestyle may slow the progression of the disease			2
@entity242 , chief executive at the @entity130 , said : ‘ there are 800,000 people living with dementia in the @entity28 , but fewer than half of people with the condition have a diagnosis			1
as numbers double and costs soar , developing new and earlier ways of diagnosing the condition is imperative			2
‘ this technology could potentially reduce the time people need to wait for a diagnosis significantly			1
after diagnosis , we also need to ensure that people are supported with information and services to enable them to gain the full benefits and support that a diagnosis can give			1
’ professor @entity264 , the national clinical director for dementia , said : ‘ combining innovative technologies in this way should help us to spot early signs of dementia , giving us time to offer patients better support and care			2
’ the project is being run by the companies @entity275 and @entity276 , which developed the @entity51 software , in partnership with @entity279 , the @entity280 of @entity281 and @entity126 and @entity282 .			0

more than 400,000 people in @entity28 are suffering from dementia
estimates forecast by 2020 nearly one million people will have dementia
rate of successful diagnosis is expected to double after these *reforms*
