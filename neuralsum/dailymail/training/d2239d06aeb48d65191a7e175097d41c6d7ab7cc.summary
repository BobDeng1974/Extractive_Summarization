carefully tiptoeing almost 3000ft above @entity0 on a thin wire got a bit too much for this adrenaline junkie - so he decided to have a lie down			0
fearless @entity6 is so used to the perilous heights he decided he deserved a short break and relaxed over the famous @entity11 city			1
balancing his whole body on the wire , he lies completely horizontal on the precarious rope before getting back up and strolling across the rest of the highline at @entity16			0
he dangled almost 2,800ft above the ground attached to the line by only an ankle strap			1
the pair were joined by fellow @entity35 @entity34 and @entity36 who together call themselves the @entity37			1
the group travel the world discovering new highlines and @entity41 jumps			2
@entity42 is considered the pinnacle of the slacklining sport , in which people prove their balancing skills by walking across a polyester or nylon wire is fixed at two points			0
@entity28 is a proponent of ' free - solo ' slacklining , where no safety harness is worn			2
unique view : @entity6 gazes at the sky as he lies among the clouds above the famous @entity11 city paradise : @entity6 lies completely horizontal on the highline at @entity16 the mind - blowing feats of the group were captured by mr @entity36 , from @entity61 , @entity35 , who risks his own life while photographing the incredible moments of bravery			1
he said : ' on a scale of one to ten , highlining is actually pretty safe - but when you do it without a leash , or with only an ankle leash like @entity28 , the danger level can reach nine or higher			2
' we 're very experienced so like to think the risk is fairly low but we all know the consequences are very high - instant death in the case of a fall freesoloing or with the ankle leash slipping off			0
' he said mr @entity28 had to pull himself back onto the line after dangling upside down			2
hanging around : @entity28 hangs upside down over the @entity81 while tied only by his ankle he said : ' to get back up from hanging on the leash @entity28 had to reach up , grab the leash , and climb up to the line which is pretty difficult and requires a lot of practice and upper body strength			1
' but i have known these guys for years and they are the best out there - they have some amazing skills and the massive @entity11 slacklining community were loving every minute of it			0
' it 's great to travel around the world and quite literally hang out with your friends meeting new people and watching how they react to you			0
' these were some of the most spectacular surroundings we have seen and being so high above the city i doubt people could even see what we were getting up to			0
