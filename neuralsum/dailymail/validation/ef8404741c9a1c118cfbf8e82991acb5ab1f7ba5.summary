@entity1 defender @entity0 is convinced his @entity3 international colleague @entity2 will become the best player in the world after a sensational start to his @entity8 career this season			1
@entity2 and @entity0 were this week included in a 20 - man @entity3 squad to play a friendly against @entity12 at the @entity13 on march 29 , and also against @entity14			1
@entity2 , who has scored 18 goals this season , has helped fire @entity8 to third in the @entity20 table , where they sit just a point behind @entity22			2
and @entity0 , who is on a season - long loan deal at @entity24 from @entity25 after impressing for @entity3 at last summer 's @entity26 in @entity12 , believes @entity2 has all the ingredients – and the temperament – to eclipse even @entity30 striker @entity29 and @entity32 's @entity31 as the best in the business			1
@entity8 's @entity2 can become the best players in the world , according to @entity0 ' i have known him for ten years and i think @entity2 has shown what he is made of , ' said @entity0			1
' he has always said that he wanted to be the best in the world and now he has arrived in a team where this can truly become a reality			0
' he can build confidence and where they play for him and he transmits the confidence that his teammates give him but honestly , i am not at all surprised by the quality of @entity2 as a player			2
' i am proud to play alongside him for @entity3 , as i am proud to play alongside @entity50 of @entity25 and @entity51 of @entity30 among others			2
i think together we are able to succeed and it would be fantastic for our country			0
@entity2 was one of @entity3 's star men at the @entity26 and will be a key man at the @entity58 ' @entity2 is a leader as are the other two			1
of course , the team is a group but there are always role models in any team and i think these three in particular are fundamental to ours			0
' there are always high quality players and these three are the pillars of our team and the rest of us must accompany them to achieve great things			0
' firstly @entity2 provides what i believe we lacked before which are his goals			0
' it 's fantastic that he is scoring so much which fills him with confidence and joy and i hope he continues to keep scoring always more			0
' if we were to talk about his characteristics , we could be here all day but for me , i love playing with a player who 's so bold , who is a fighter , runs for 90 minutes and always loves training			0
' i have heard from many of his @entity8 teammates also that he never tires in training or on the pitch and this is fundamental for the team			0
' @entity1 's @entity0 is proud to play for @entity3 alongside the likes of @entity2 and @entity50 of @entity25 also included in the squad is @entity30 goalkeeper @entity51 , former @entity95 midfielder @entity94 , @entity97 's @entity96 , @entity1 's @entity98 and @entity25 midfielder @entity50			1
and @entity0 has issued a warning to @entity12 boss @entity100 to expect a serious test against fellow @entity3 at the @entity13			1
the friendly in @entity103 will take on extra significance as @entity12 secured a dramatic penalty shootout win against @entity3 to reach the last eight at the @entity26 last summer and set up an all - @entity108 quarter - final against @entity109			1
' it 's a game that give brings up some pain , for everything that happened in the @entity26 which was a beautiful game , i think as much for @entity12 as it was for @entity3 , ' added @entity0			1
' the game played on for 120 minutes before going to penalties and sadly @entity12 won but they really had to work for it			2
' to play this game as a revenge match in a beautiful country , and beautiful city such as @entity103 , all @entity120 will take interest and i hope it goes well			0
' @entity12 v @entity3 is on march 29 at 3pm at the @entity13 in @entity103			2
