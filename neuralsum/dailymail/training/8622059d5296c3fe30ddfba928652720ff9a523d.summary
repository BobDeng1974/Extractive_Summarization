the elaborate tattoo emblazoned across @entity2 's muscular shoulder bears the legend : ' @entity4 '			0
but while @entity6 , a 34 - year - old former porn star from @entity7 , might have a manhood worth bragging about now , that was n't always the case			1
instead he is one of an increasing number of @entity13 men opting to go under the knife to enhance their manhood - an operation now so popular , demand has jumped 40 per cent in just one year , according to a leading surgeon			1
satisfied customer : ' gypsy porn ' pioneer @entity20 has spoken out about going under the knife demand : leading plastic surgeon , dr @entity22 , has seen demand leap by 40 per cent ' i know some men – and women – will be amused at what they perceive as self - indulgence , ' says dr @entity22 , who operates on more than 300 men a year in his @entity31 clinic			1
' but believe me , large numbers of men reading this will not be laughing – even visiting the gym can cause heartache [ for them ]			0
' dr @entity22 , who says demand for the procedure has shot up by more than 40 per cent in the last year , is n't the only surgeon to find himself bombarded with applications from men desperate to give their manhood a boost			1
dr @entity45 , a @entity46 - based surgeon , claimed last year that demand for penis extension surgery among @entity50 men was shooting up by a record 25 per cent annually , and pinned the blame on the flood of sexualised images that crop up on everything from tv to billboards			1
' with everyone seeing images of the body the whole time these days , men are more aware and worried about their bodies , ' he told @entity63			2
' all the parts are important and the genitals are no exception			0
we 're living in the age of images , with sexual ones very often on the front page			2
sex gets more attention and people feel the need to be more competitive			0
' dr @entity22 , whose clinic , the @entity76 , is based on @entity31 , agrees			1
' male models , notably @entity78 in the @entity80 adverts , @entity81 for @entity82 and model @entity83 for @entity84 , posing on buses and billboards in tight pants that leave little to the imagination drive the trend , ' he explains			1
' the demand for these operations is growing constantly			2
' but it is n't all @entity81 's fault			0
indeed , as dr @entity22 is keen to point out , porn is also behind the increase - not just in penoplasties , but in breast enhancement and labiaplasty surgery as well			1
insecure : large lunchboxes , such those belonging to @entity100 and @entity78 , make men less confident ' it is also the same for girls with smaller breasts , ' he explains			1
' it ’s a similar problem			0
more and more young people are coming here asking for this operation			0
' i am here to help the people			0
i ’m here to listen			0
i ’m not here to judge			0
but the demand is at an all time high			2
' for those already in the porn industry such as @entity118 , the pressure to have a large penis is extreme , and as a result , there 's little that adult actors wo n't do to enhance their assets			1
' i always had a big one but i wanted a monster , ' says @entity118 who had the girth of his penis increased using fat injections			2
' having a big penis is the ultimate - there 's no way you could make it in this [ porn ] industry without it and having surgery helped me get roles every time			1
' @entity6 , who pioneered a sub-genre called @entity141 porn before retiring after meeting the woman he describes as ' the love of my life ' , describes the sum he paid for the procedure as ' the best money i ever spent '			2
but while @entity6 is thrilled , not every penoplasty works out as imagined , with just 35 per cent of men happy with the results , according to the @entity153			0
50 shades of @entity155 : well - endowed celebrities such as actor @entity83 are fuelling the trend that , however , has n't put men off in the slightest , with many of those who do go under the knife boasting average or large sized penises			1
the issue , says dr @entity22 , is a lack of self - esteem			1
' i always ask why the patient wants the treatment at the beginning of the consultation , ' he explains			0
' most tell me it 's because they lack confidence , have low self - esteem and do n’t feel confident enough to show their penis in front of their partner when it 's flaccid			1
' it ’s a lot to do with the way they see their own body			0
if you go to the gym , you do n’t need to be an expert to see that it 's always the man with a big penis who is the one parading around the changing rooms with no towel			2
' it makes other men , especially those who think they are smaller , feel intimidated and so they cover up			0
this is every day life			0
if you go to the gym and pay attention to that , you will see it			0
' so can plastic surgery really be the answer to this most intimate of dilemmas ? the penis extension market is a large and growing one , with hundreds of gizmos marketed to men desperate to give their manhood a boost			1
chop chop : penis extensions involve cutting the suspensory ligament for an extra one to four inches of length prices for penis extending devices can be as low as £ 10 - a far more affordable option than a £ 6,000 penoplasty - but dr @entity22 says men who try to give their bits a boost using a contraption bought online risk wasting their money			1
' unfortunately there is no miracle cream to enlarge your penis , ' he says			2
instead , surgery is the only option for those who think themselves small - or simply want a boost			2
' the majority of clients are average - sized but you get the odd one who is already very well endowed and does n’t need anything but thinks that he wants more , ' explains dr @entity22			1
' then there are also men who have a real small penis and they need help , yes			2
having said that , there 's not much difference , mentally , between a man with a real small penis and a man with a normal penis who feels small			0
' it 's clear this problem has been neglected by the medical profession for a long time			0
' the number of patients asking dr @entity22 for a penis extension has increased by 40 per cent in the last 12 months			1
but what does having a penoplasty really involve ? the surgeon talks femail through the operation			0
' there are two ways to enlarge your penis , ' explains dr @entity22			1
' to lengthen a penis , i look for a ligament that runs from the base of the penis to the pubic bone , which is called the suspensory ligament			0
' i cut the ligament where it is attached to the pubic bone and in doing that the penis is released and drops out more – and that is the increase in length			2
' for most men , cutting the ligament results in an increase in length of between one and four inches , while dr @entity22 's fat injections can increase girth by the same amount			1
the extra length , however , only applies to flaccid penises - erect ones remain the same length and tilt upwards at a 90 degree angle			0
' i have performed this operation for over 20 years , ' adds dr @entity22 , ' and i can guarantee that there is no increase in length when erect			1
if someone claims this is possible , they are wrong			0

dr @entity22 has seen a 40 *%* increase in demand for penis surgery
says demand for £ 6,000 op is driven by sexualised images and porn
well - endowed *a-listers* such as @entity78 and @entity83 contribute
low self - esteem and lack of confidence among common reasons for op
says many clients tell him they are miserable with average sized penis
demand for breast implants and *designer* *vaginas* also shooting up
