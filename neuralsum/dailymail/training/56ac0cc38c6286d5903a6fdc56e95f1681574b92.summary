by @entity0 a pair of identical twin brothers who were caught fighting in a barbaric street brawl have both been given the same jail sentence - because police ca n’t tell them apart			1
@entity6 and @entity7 , 19 , were caught on @entity8 - both naked from the waist up - taking part in mass violence , in @entity12 , @entity13 , on july 6 last year			1
a court heard the siblings were seen pelting missiles including a portable television at members of a ' rival ' family			1
identical twin brothers @entity6 and @entity7 were caught fighting in a barbaric street brawl and have both been given the same jail sentence - because police ca n't tell them apart a court heard the twins also hurled vases and bottles at their victims - with one brother attacking a group of men with a spanner			1
but because the brothers are almost impossible to tell apart it was ' unclear who did what ' as both were naked from the waist up and wearing blue shorts			1
they have both sentenced to nine months ' detention at a young offenders institute after officers could not work out which one had been involved in more of the violence			1
jailing the pair at @entity47 , judge @entity45 said : ' your conduct has been described by witnesses as mayhem , barbaric and vile			1
' you were not the only people to behave disgracefully			2
' there was undoubted provocation			0
' a group of other men visited the house to cause trouble			1
he and his twin were caught on @entity8 - both naked from the waist up - taking part in mass violence , in @entity12 , @entity13 , on july 6 last year a court heard the siblings were seen pelting missiles including a portable television at members of a ' rival ' family			1
pictured is @entity7 ' that was the catalyst for what followed			1
' the trouble started in the house and spilled out onto the street			2
we can see from the cctv how close this was to the centre of @entity12			2
' the court heard the vicious attack was sparked when members of the @entity84 family banged on the door of the twins ’ friend @entity88 ’s home			0
prosecuting @entity89 , said : ' a witness living in @entity91 described hearing a disturbance in the street			2
' he could see from his living room window four men go into a house			2
' a short time later a man was heard hammering on the door , it was opened and he went inside , followed by six others			0
' a @entity102 car and a van appeared and the occupants of the car got out and stood by the front door			0
' a man then appeared , he was bleeding heavily from his head and was followed by the rest of the men			2
' they were shouting at each other and there was something of a stand - off			0
the twins also hurled missiles at their victims - with one brother attacking a group of men with a spanner			1
but because the brothers ( left @entity6 and right @entity7 ) are impossible to tell apart it was ' unclear who did what ' probably the most famous twins in criminal history were @entity129 and @entity130 from @entity131 in east @entity132			1
it was reported that early on in their careers , both twins were arrested for a particularly vicious assault but the police did not prosecute because they could not identify which twin was the assailant			2
since identical twins - also known as monozygotic twins - come from the same fertilised egg , it was believed that they have the same dna			0
however , a new test is being developed which would enable twins ' dna to be told apart by scientists in @entity148			0
they have found a subtle genetic difference which means there is now a definitive test to learn which twin was at the scene of a crime			0
this breakthrough will stop the current procedure whereby one twin might escape justice because of the inability of the authorities to tell them apart			0
' the witness says one of the twins had a small portable tv that was thrown through the car window			0
' glass bottles and vases were also thrown at the vehicle before the driver of the car attempted to drive away			0
' one of the twins then attacked the vehicle with a large metal spanner			0
' the pair both admitted one count of affray and @entity6 was also caged for a further 15 months to run consecutively for an unrelated affray for an earlier incident			1
@entity184 , defending @entity6 , said : ' it is accepted that the other family came to the house of @entity88 and that ’s what caused this incident in the first place			1
' they even blocked both ends of the road with a car and a van			0
' mr @entity7 has matured since this incident , he is no longer the angry man he once was			1
' he even apologises to the people of @entity91 who saw this going on			0
' @entity201 , defending @entity7 , added : ' since this offence in july last year there has not been any further incident involving @entity7			1
' he is now a roofer and has stuck at it			0
he has reduced his drinking and now has a stable life			0
he has been out of trouble			0
' co-accused , @entity88 , 29 , and @entity209 , 36 , both from @entity12 , were each handed a 12 - month community order , with supervision for 12 months , and ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work .			2
