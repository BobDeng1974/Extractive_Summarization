a puppy with three legs ca n't find a home because she keeps getting passed over for able - bodied dogs			0
five - month - old @entity5 was born with a deformed right front paw which had to be amputated after she was turned into the @entity7			1
puppies are normally snapped up within days , but because of @entity5 's disability no one wants to adopt her			1
@entity5 , a rottweiler and @entity23 bull terrier cross , has been at the centre for a month			1
ms @entity17 said : ' her disability means she is still lonely			0
if she was n't missing a leg , she would have been rehomed by now			0
' @entity5 's owners took her to the centre because they were struggling to deal with her			2
a vet later concluded a birth defect had caused her front leg to be folded up and that amputation was the only solution			1
because @entity5 was already used to getting by with three usable paws she was able to run around straight after surgery			0
ms @entity17 said if @entity5 was n't missing a leg she would have been been adopted by a new owner by now ms @entity17 said while @entity5 , pictured above before her operation , would be more suited to gentle exercise , rather than long hikes , her disability would n't make her more difficult to look after the rottweiler and @entity23 bull terrier cross is ' the happiest puppy you will ever meet in your life ' and since then ms @entity13 and her team have been taking @entity5 to hydrotherapy and physiotherapy sessions to help her build up strength in her legs			1
@entity5 's stump is currently too small for a prosthesis , but ms @entity17 hopes that who ever adopts the puppy might help get the dog back onto four legs			2
ms @entity58 , 25 , added : ' she is the happiest puppy you will ever meet in your life			1
' unfortunately , there was nothing that could be done for her			0
' the @entity7 hopes people can look past @entity64 's disability because she is ' 100 per cent worth it ' ms @entity17 said while @entity5 would be more suited to gentle exercise , rather than long hikes , her disability would n't make her more difficult to look after than an able - bodied dog			1
she said : ' i think people are concerned that because she only has three legs she will be much more difficult to look after and they are worried about taking on the extra responsibility			0
' we would n't want people to take home a puppy without thinking it through carefully but @entity5 is such a great dog and i hope people can see past her disability to see that			2
' she is 100 per cent worth it			0
' she will need some more support from her vet than the average dog , but she is fantastic with children and other dogs			0
