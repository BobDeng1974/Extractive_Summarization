a new ' planking ' style craze is sweeping the internet during the big freeze - posing naked in the snow			1
the impromptu challenge was started by @entity6 care worker @entity5 , 40 , who posed in her underwear with neighbour @entity8 in a bid to amuse friends			1
but after posting the photo on @entity13 the idea quickly snowballed and a page dedicated to naked snow pictures went viral			1
@entity16 : @entity5 ( left ) and @entity8 posed for skimpy pictures of themselves for a bit of fun			1
now hundreds of people have been photographed naked in the snow chilling : this trio of ladies relax with a drink and wear beautiful bright colours outside in sub-zero temperatures the group now has more than 5,500 likes and 250 photos showing people of all ages stripping down and covering their unmentionables in imaginative ways			1
@entity5 , from the village of @entity35 , has been amazed by the response and has had offers of photos from as far afield as @entity39			1
she said : ' it is totally amazing , i really had no idea it would take off like this			2
' people have really embraced it , and a lot of the pictures are of friends of friends , but now there 's some coming in from people i do n't know			2
the @entity52 : probably not a good idea to wolf whistle this rifle - wielding young lady			0
a woman protects her modesty with a pair of tyres ( right ) bareback : @entity60 posted this image of herself on a bike hats : this woman uses tape and headgear to spare her blushes , while @entity68 uses a bin snowball fight : although not naked , these revellers enter into the spirit of the craze with a snowball fight in their underwear ' i 've had interest from @entity39 and @entity78 and people messaging me saying " we 're not in @entity6 , can we send in a pic ? "			1
' they are welcome from anywhere , as long as they are kept tasteful			0
' the group - entitled ' @entity6 , let 's get naked in the snow ! ' - began on friday after @entity5 and her fellow careworkers battled to get to those they support in the overnight deluge of snow after work , as a way to amuse her friends and family , she decided to pose in her underwear with next - door neighbour @entity8 and then invited friends to do the same			1
' i really did just think it would be a bit of fun , to provide a bit of a giggle for maybe 50 of my friends and neighbours in the village , but on saturday it really took off , ' she added			0
' my husband and i went out on saturday to the club in the village and a lad said " hi @entity5 , i did n't recognise you with your clothes on "			1
that 's when i knew it had gone a bit further than that			0
' within 24 hours the page had gone viral , and hundreds of people had also shared photos of ever - more inventive ways of obscuring their dignity - using snowmen , bottles , scarves and even a frying pan			2
brave : a photo posted on the @entity13 group ' @entity6 naked in the snow ! ' by @entity128 cool koala : fun - loving @entity130 poses in her garden and a woman poses with two enormous snow balls @entity135 and a bear : this blonde keeps warm with what appears to be a hot water bottle and a woman covers up with a scarf three women enjoy a spot of naked sledging now @entity5 said she wants to turn what started as ' nothing more than a bit of a giggle ' into a fundraiser for a hospital that helped her daughter when she was born prematurely			1
@entity153 , now 12 , was born six and a half weeks early and was immediately rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit at @entity155 , in @entity156 , @entity6 , where she was diagnosed with a heart condition			1
at just two - years - old the tot underwent major heart surgery at the neighbouring @entity160 and has now made a full recovery			0
the mum - of - two said she could not express enough thanks to both hospitals and really wanted to use the opportunity she had been given to help out the @entity166			0
she said : ' when @entity153 was born we were separated from her and could n't stay on her ward , it was awful			0
snow angels : three beauties make a snowman 's day			2
two smiling ladies ( right ) on a trampoline white wedding : this foursome staged a naked wedding party @entity178 : a @entity180 hat adorns this smiling woman and an outstretched woman welcomes the snow in a garden ' the support and treatment we received was second to none and without the hard work and dedication of the staff at both hospitals we never would have got through			1
' if i can manage to raise some funds to allow them to create a place where a family can stay with their child it will be worth it			0
' and in 2000 when she was born the hospital did n't even have the equipment to know what heart condition @entity153 had so we were rushed in an ambulance between hospitals			0
' from that day on i have always wanted to help them in some way			0
white rider : motorbike helmets save both lives and modesty nude man on an island : hopefully traffic was n't affected by this cheery fellow a tattooed man wearing a tie , a cloth cap and little else			2
bizarrely , most of the people in the pictures wear headgear ' i 'm just so excited , i have managed to do this , i ca n't wait to help them in some way			2
they really deserve the help , they are fantastic			0
' i would love to be able to just provide something for them like a machine , something big , something to say thank you			0
' @entity5 added that her husband @entity239 , 39 , was also very supportive and had already uploaded his own photo on to the site			2
she has two daughters , @entity153 , 12 and @entity243 , 8			0
anyone who wishes to donate can do so here			0
@entity245 ? : a man clears his path in a halo and angel wings and three men bare their bottoms ouch : @entity252 uses freezing snow to cover himself a buff fellow makes a romantic gesture and a man hides his shame behind a space hopper			1
