this year , however , it seems the real fireworks will be off - court – at least if @entity6 and @entity7 have anything to do with it			2
the players , two of the best in the world , have become embroiled in an extraordinary cat - fight ahead of this year ’s tournament , which begins today			0
yesterday defending @entity1 champion miss @entity6 , 31 , tried to calm the row at a press conference on the eve of the tournament			1
it began after she gave an interview to an @entity31 magazine in which she called an unnamed player , believed to be miss @entity7 , ‘ boring ’			1
‘ she begins every interview with , “ i ’m so happy			0
” it ’s so boring , ’ miss @entity6 said			1
‘ she ’s still not going to be invited to the cool parties			0
and hey , if she wants to be with the guy with a black heart [ @entity17 ] , go for it			2
’ public spat : @entity6 , pictured at a press conference on sunday , has said if miss @entity7 wants a man with a ' black heart ' she should ' go for it ' at the weekend miss @entity7 responded by pointing out that miss @entity6 is believed to be dating her married tennis coach , @entity44 , 43			1
the 26 - year - old @entity22 - born star said : ‘ if @entity6 wants to talk about something personal , she should talk about her relationship and her boyfriend who was married , who is getting a divorce and who has kids – and not draw attention to other things			2
’ the pair have had a notoriously competitive relationship on the court , fuelled by the fact @entity21 , the world number three , has not beaten her rival in nine years			0
yesterday miss @entity6 said she had ‘ no comment ’ on whether she felt disturbed by @entity21 ’s dig at her personal life			1
but asked if she felt the player was ‘ trying to attack her mentally because she could n’t touch her on court , ’ miss @entity6 seemed to agree			1
instagrammed : miss @entity6 posted this picture of herself and old flame @entity17 last year she also told the press conference that she had apologised to @entity21 over the row on thursday , when they both attended a glamorous pre-tournament party in @entity75			1
however , in a thinly veiled challenge , she said she was looking forward to seeing miss @entity7 on court during the championship			1
she said : ‘ i personally talked to @entity7 at the player party , incidentally			2
i said , “ look , i want to personally apologise to you if you are offended by being brought into my situation			0
‘ i want to take this moment to just pour myself , be open , say i ’m very sorry for this whole situation			0
’ she added : ‘ i have the most respect for @entity7 on and off the court			0
that ’s another reason why , being a woman , i wanted to reach out to her and say , “ look , this is this , this is this , sorry ”			0
’ she said she thought @entity21 ‘ definitely did accept ’ her apology , saying : ‘ we always have great conversations			0
’ miss @entity6 said that having mr @entity44 as her coach had made her more motivated after she crashed out of the @entity96 last year .			1
