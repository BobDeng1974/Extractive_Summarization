@entity6 , 42 , of @entity16 , ( pictured left ) and @entity22 , 67 , from @entity15 , ( right ) both died after receiving an ' infected kidney ' from an alcoholic donor , an inquest in @entity15 has heard post-mortem examinations revealed that both men had the parasite in their bodies			1
@entity15 @entity30 heard that there have only been five known cases like this worldwide in humans - all of which have proved fatal			2
both men died of meningoencephalitis , an inflammation of the brain caused by the parasite			0
the inquest was told by relatives of both men that they had been informed that the donor 's organs had been rejected by several other hospitals after being deemed ' unfit for transplant ' - but they were only told after their loved ones had already died			1
mr @entity6 's father , @entity49 , told the hearing he would not have signed the consent form for his disabled son had he known the organ came from an alcoholic			1
he said : ' i ended up signing @entity6 's death warrant			1
' i thought the donor was a person who had died in a car crash locally			2
we knew nothing about the donor 's lifestyle			1
' the first time we knew anything was wrong was after @entity6 's death			1
' mr @entity6 said : ' after he died we were told that the donor lived rough , was alcoholic , had cirrhosis of the liver and that they did n't know the cause of the meningitis that killed him			1
' we find it difficult to understand why the hospital in @entity15 used these kidneys			0
they had been rejected from all other hospitals - all his other organs were considered unfit for transplant			1
' that sentiment was echoed by mr @entity7 's widow @entity81			0
she said her husband , who needed dialysis after suffering septicaemia , had been in good health before being bumped up the waiting list			0
the family of @entity6 outside his inquest at @entity89 - from left to right his mother @entity90 , dad @entity91 and sister @entity92 ' he coped very well on dialysis , ' she added			1
' he was very upbeat about the future and would have been happy to stay on dialysis for the rest of his life			0
' he was in surprising good health for someone who needed a transplant			0
' the nurses ( on the transplant ward ) once joked to him ' what are you doing here , you 're in far too good health , you should n't be here '			0
' mrs @entity106 added she had been told nothing about the donor - disputing accusations her husband had been told			1
' i maintain my husband did not properly consent to the operation , ' she said			0
the hearing was told mr @entity7 was told his donor had liver cirrhosis ' while in theatre ' before being given anaesthetic			1
mrs @entity106 said : ' even if this conversation did happen i do not think he would have been aware ( of what was going on )			0
' acting coroner @entity118 said both the men had a transplant at @entity18 last november			0
for mr @entity6 , it was his third transplant , while it was mr @entity7 's first			1
but following a successful operation , mr @entity6 's condition began to deteriorate and an initial diagnosis of viral meningitis was made			1
he died on december 15			0
his father said : ' our opinion was that @entity6 was not going to improve and he was being used as a guinea pig			2
' mr @entity7 and mr @entity6 both underwent the operations at the @entity18 in @entity15 ( pictured ) last year , where they were given kidneys infected with the deadly parasitic worm halicephalobus mr @entity6 senior said he had a meeting with health officials the following month and was told ' all other hospitals had rejected ' the donors ' organs - including eyes , lungs , liver and heart - because they were considered unfit for transplants			1
mr @entity7 's wife , @entity81 , said her husband had twice been told a transplant match had been found , only for the operation to be cancelled			2
at 2am on november 30 , he was told a new match had been found			0
' i was told the operation went very well and the kidney was scanned in recovery , ' mrs @entity106 said			0
' he continued to make good progress and was passing urine			0
' he was discharged from hospital on december 6 and attended a follow - up appointment four days later			0
later that day mrs @entity106 said her husband became ' very confused '			0
she said : ' he kept asking where his father was - even though he had died years ago			2
' he was then readmitted to hospital , where he was sent to intensive care			0
he died on december 17			0
the inquest heard no post mortem had been carried out on the donor following his unusual death before his organs were offered for transplant			1
the inquest also heard the organs of the donor had been rejected by every hospital they had been offered to before they were accepted by the @entity169 in @entity15			1
the kidneys had been described in documents as ' poor function '			0
mr @entity6 told @entity89 about the final desperate days of his son 's life as the parasite in his infected kidney			1
he said : ' @entity6 could n't feel his legs , could n't control his bowels and was coming in and out of consciousness			2
' he said : ' @entity181 i am frightened , i am scared , i do n't know what is happening			0
no more hospital @entity181 , i have had enough '			0
' mr @entity6 said he asked how his wife @entity184 was before slipping into a coma which he never came out of			2
a representative for the @entity169 suggested that the surgeon had told them prior to the transplant that the donor had died of a brain infection which was low risk			1
mr @entity6 said : ' no , that is not true , that is false			2
' the inquest was told the halicephalobus parasite lives in soil , manure and compost			2
its occurance is rare in animals - although it can be found in horses			0
acting coroner mr @entity118 heard neither of the men who died had had contact with horses prior to their death			2

@entity22 and @entity6 both died after having transplant surgery
but the kidneys were infected with deadly parasitic worm
family *members* who signed consent form were not told of donor 's lifestyle
donor was a ' *homeless* ' alcoholic who had cirrhosis of the liver
father who signed consent form feels he *‘* signed his son 's death warrant *’*
inquest heard other hospitals had rejected the organs because they were considered ' unfit for transplant ' - but relatives were only told after deaths
