by @entity0 a @entity2 couple have managed to smuggle their newly adopted daughter out of @entity5 just after @entity6 officially annexed the state			1
@entity8 was waiting for the final pieces of paperwork to be filed for her and husband @entity11 's adoption of a 16 - year - old orphan called @entity14 when @entity6 troops flooded the streets and a referendum decided that @entity5 would become a part of @entity6			1
although the official unification was n't immediate , bureaucrats stopped issuing the documents the @entity22 needed to remove @entity14 , who has since renamed herself @entity23 , from her orphanage and the region			1
reunited : @entity8 and @entity26 with their newly adopted daughter @entity23 with @entity26 returned to work in the @entity30 , @entity8 enlisted the help of @entity32 , a @entity34 woman , to help her and @entity23 escape the area			1
' it was terrifying , ' @entity8 told @entity37 on friday , just hours before flying home to @entity2			2
' we 've had a lot of miracles			0
' as @entity43 crowds marched , denouncing the @entity34 's @entity45 supporters , @entity8 became increasingly frantic			0
@entity32 finally managed to procure a tax identification number for @entity23 , after one refusal after another from bureaucrats unwilling to issue a passport for the orphan			0
uncertain future : the @entity22 met @entity23 when she was almost 16 - the age at which she would have aged out of the @entity34 orphanage system and been left to fend for herself adoptive parents : @entity11 and @entity8 have adopted children from the @entity34 before the document enabled them to buy a rail ticket to @entity59 and the three boarded the train just hours before @entity6 completed its annexation of @entity5			1
as they approached the border , armed soldiers boarded the car , asking the conductor if there were any foreigners aboard			0
he indicated @entity23 and @entity8 were @entity30			1
the soldiers , miraculously , asked no further questions and the train continued on its way to @entity59			0
' when the train came into the station [ in @entity59 ] , @entity32 and i looked at each other and started crying , ' @entity26 said			0
' we were in survival mode and it all hits you			0
' the @entity82 , who have adopted several other children from the area in the past , met @entity23 in december , when she was just short of her 16th birthday - the age at which she would age out of @entity34 's orphanage system and be left to fend for herself			2
new daughter : the @entity22 say @entity23 is bright and confident and believe she will thrive in the @entity30 the connection was instant and the couple felt sure the ' smart , fun ' teen would thrive in their family			1
however , their battle was n't over once @entity8 and @entity23 reached @entity59 , as officials demanded she be returned to @entity5 and refused to issue a passport			1
finally , after days of bureaucratic back and forth , @entity23 was granted a passport and flew to her new home with her new mother on saturday			2
@entity37 reports that other adoptions that were in progress in @entity5 have been halted			0
according to advocates , it 's unlikely @entity6 will allow any adoptions by @entity30 to proceed .			2

@entity8 and @entity26 went to @entity5 to adopt a 16 - year - old orphan , @entity23
while they waited for paperwork to be completed , @entity5 was annexed by @entity6
@entity8 had to smuggle her daughter out of the region just hours before the annexation was complete
@entity5 has now been unified with @entity6 and all @entity30 adoptions have been halted
@entity23 flew to @entity2 on saturday to begin her life as the adopted daughter of the @entity22
