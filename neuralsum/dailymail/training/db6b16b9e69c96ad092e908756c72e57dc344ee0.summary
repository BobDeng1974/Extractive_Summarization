by @entity1 reporter published : 13:32 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 17:00 est , 14 november 2013 one of the founders of lyrics site @entity3 has revealed how a brain tumor he initially dismissed as a toothache turned him mean - even making him tell @entity7 to ' suck my d * * * '			1
@entity10 , 30 , revealed that the tumor left him so moody that his co-workers at the website , which allows users to annotate lyrics with their meanings online , told him to get his act together			1
since he formed the site in 2009 with two fellow @entity22 graduates , the @entity19 - based company has attracted a $ 15 million investment from @entity24 and has now expanded to annotating images - in what the owners claim will revolutionize the way users interact with the internet			1
but several months ago , @entity10 began experiencing some bizarre health problems			1
@entity31 : @entity10 , one of the founders of @entity3 , has revealed he recently underwent surgery for a brain tumor that altered his personality			1
he is pictured at a conference in may after having his wisdom teeth removed , he had a migraine down the right side of his head which he blamed on the dental work - even though it lasted weeks , he told @entity41			1
he was also unable to work out as hard and began having problems with his left hand , such as shaking , which he chalked down to an athletic injury from his youth			0
but as well as physical struggles , he started noticing other changes			2
' my personality became terrible , ' he said			2
he explained how he started smoking a lot of marijuana , his girlfriend broke up with him and he began shouting at people at work			2
' my cofounders were furious at me because i was nâ€™t doing shit , ' he said			0
' they said , " you have to get your act together "			0
' attitude : @entity10 , pictured left with rapper @entity60 , previously told @entity61 founder @entity7 he can ' suck my d * * * ' but he now puts that attitude down to a brain tumor that was discovered this year famous friends : he is pictured with @entity66 and @entity67 , who has invested $ 15m in the company @entity3 is a website dedicated to the annotation and interpretation of lyrics , poetry , news and other forms of text			1
users upload a rap , for example , and can annotate the lines with meaning behind the words or with opinions			1
contributors earn ' iq ' points when they make interesting annotations , so other users can see who best to trust			0
on the site , users can listen to songs , read their lyrics and click the lines that interest them for pop - up annotations , which are marked with a different color			1
others can correct content while moderators monitor it			0
their annotation system has since expanded to images , where users can click on an image for a description or to see how they can buy it			0
and in one particularly bizarre incident , he lashed out at @entity61 founder @entity7 after posting pictures to @entity106 showing them hanging out together with rapper @entity60 and investor @entity67			1
when @entity7 's team found out about the photographs , they asked @entity10 to remove them			1
he responded : ' @entity7 can suck my d * * * '			2
he now blames this outburst on the tumor he unknowingly had growing inside him			0
@entity10 finally went to a doctor six weeks ago and was sent for a brain scan , which found he had a brain tumor			1
he was put in an ambulance to another hospital for surgery the following day			2
but with his personality altered , he just played on his phone nonchalantly as he was prepped for surgery			2
he survived the surgery and spent two nights in hospital , before recovering at home			0
he was left with a large scar , which he hates , ' but girls seem to like it , ' he said			0
after the operation , he said he is back to working out and is now more driven with his business			0
' this really lit a fire under my ass for working on the website , ' he said			0
' this brain tumor motivated everyone , gave everyone a swift kick in the ass			1
everyone 's working 10 times as hard now			0
' now the team is hoping to expand and change the way people interact with the internet			0
on the mend : since undergoing the surgery , @entity10 ( right ) said he is more motivated at the company , which he started with fellow @entity22 graduates @entity153 ( center ) and @entity155 ( left ) in 2009 two weeks ago , they launched @entity157 , which allows users to annotate imagery			1
for example , if a user sees a bag they like , they can click on it and be taken to a website to buy it			0
then @entity3 will get a percentage of the purchase for sending the user there			2
@entity10 still has touches of the hip hop persona he uses to promote the brand , @entity41 noted , but his rhetoric has softened since the surgery			1
he said that drugs are also off limits after the surgery affected his blood - brain barrier			1
' the only drug i have each day is a cup of green tea , and it hits me like about six lines of cocaine , ' he said			0
@entity10 formed his company with @entity153 and @entity188 ; the trio met while studying at @entity22 for their undergraduate degrees			2
he later studied at @entity191 .			0

@entity10 , 30 , is one of the *co-founders* of @entity3 , which allows users to annotate songs , poetry and other texts with meanings
earlier this year he started getting migraines - but blamed it on surgery for wisdom teeth
he also noticed his personality changed , making him lash out at his co-workers and others , like @entity61 founder @entity7
he was *diagnosed* with a brain tumor and underwent surgery the next day
