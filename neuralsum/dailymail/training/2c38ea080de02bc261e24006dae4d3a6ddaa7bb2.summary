dozens of scientists , journalists and tourists were evacuated by helicopter from the stricken @entity22 vessel @entity23 on thursday after it became stuck on @entity25			1
the ship was being used by the expedition to follow the route taken by @entity30 explorer @entity28 in 1912			0
the team intended to repeat measurements taken by @entity28 and so study environmental change over the past century			2
but their ship is classed as ‘ ice - strengthened ’ , which means it can not break ice sheets and can operate only in light ice			1
@entity39 , of @entity41 ’s @entity40 , blamed the team for not investing in a ship suitable to the ‘ easily predictable ’ sea ice			2
mr @entity39 , who has completed successful missions to where the ship was going , said : ‘ the expedition was hopelessly optimistic in trying to carry out this mission on the cheap and has needlessly taken many risks			0
‘ the team were in an area where it is common for ice to suddenly build up and instead of using an icebreaker , they used an ice - strengthened ship , which is totally unsuitable			1
’ it is estimated the rescue , after several failed attempts , will have cost £ 220,000 , a bill which is likely to be paid by @entity30 taxpayers			0
the 22 @entity22 crew members are still on board after the remaining 50 tourists were rescued on thursday the 22 @entity22 crew are still aboard and have to wait until the ice thins before they head home			2

any risk to lives was minimal ’ .			0
