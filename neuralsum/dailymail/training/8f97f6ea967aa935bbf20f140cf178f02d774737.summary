the @entity0 is known for its magnificent beaches			1
but with the recession , the waves of good fortune that generally lap its shores became crashing breakers as the financial storm blew harder			2
@entity8 suffered more than most			2
it 's not the easiest island to get to , and it 's not cheap , so the visitors drained away			2
@entity12 soaked away into the sand , leaving developments marooned , some half - built , on the beaches			0
but though @entity8 lost its mojo for a while , there 's no doubt it 's still a special place - certainly to judge by some of the visitors who have stuck by it , including @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
the heart - stopping waters and white sands of @entity8 are coming back into vogue walking through the soft sand of @entity32 in @entity8 , in the @entity33 , is an aerobic workout of course beaches themselves are not affected by recession			1
and after 25 years of research - exhaustive research , you understand - lying prone on towels and loungers , counting grains of sand , i 'd say that @entity8 has the finest beaches and sea in the @entity0			1
you can get the idea with an early morning walk on a near - deserted strand			0
a gentle stroll ? not in @entity8			2
in places the sand along the mile - and - a - half stretch of @entity32 is so deep that walking becomes aerobic exercise			0
and the waves there are mesmerisingly beautiful - they swell into glassy green , their vertical faces marbling momentarily as they catch the sun , and then furl and crash			0
on top of the bluff at one end of @entity32 is @entity66 , one of the @entity0 's loveliest hotels , which will re-open next month under the flag of @entity70 from @entity71			1
a beachside terrace at the re-opened @entity66 hotel , on top of the bluff at one end of @entity32 @entity76 poses on a beach for last summer 's @entity79 collection - the singer frequents @entity8 celebrities such as @entity76 and sir @entity23 have stuck by @entity8 through its rough period at the other end sits the outsize @entity84 ( with an unfeasible 300 rooms on an island just 16 miles long ) , which has attracted an @entity90 crowd , and sometimes offers good deals			1
for something more sympathetic and self - contained , there 's @entity94 , or the lovely @entity95			0
on the south coast , @entity96 , set on the heart - stoppingly pretty @entity98 , and @entity99 on @entity100 , roll on			0
and that 's not to forget @entity8 's villas , some of the finest in the islands			1
after breaking the mould in the mid- 1990s as the island 's first ' supervilla ' , @entity106 has returned completely restored			1
@entity109 is set on the heart - stoppingly pretty @entity98 a guest enjoys a massage outside under perfect blue skies at @entity96 the spectacular @entity114 , a geometric abstraction in glass and white concrete , which opened to acclaim last year , is opening two more villas on @entity32 soon			0
the restaurateurs have also stuck at it , working hard through difficult times			0
@entity8 's restaurants are excellent - well , it is @entity33 territory with mainly @entity126 visitors - but throw in some @entity128 chefs , and excellent produce brought via nearby @entity130 , and you have excellent cuisine			1
look out for @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			0
on the beach at @entity32 , @entity137 has opened its @entity139 for simple meals , and @entity128 - inspired @entity141 offers an elegant and lazy lunch			0
@entity8 is much lower - key than nearby @entity143 , but do n't let that put you off			1
you might still bump into @entity76 and @entity146 … @entity147 ( turquoiseholidays.co.uk , 01494 678400 ) offers seven nights room only at @entity96 from £ 1,899pp , including @entity149 return flights via @entity151 and onward flights with @entity153 .			2

@entity155 and the *economic* *downturn* saw @entity8 's appeal *diminish*
but the recession has n't made the island 's beaches any less *majestic*
and the @entity0 island is *bouncing* back with some *big* name fans
it 's a special place for @entity76 , @entity23 and @entity24
