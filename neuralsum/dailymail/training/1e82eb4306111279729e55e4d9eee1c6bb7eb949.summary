@entity0 was never going to get the @entity2 job , @entity3 will look elsewhere for his next manager after @entity5 decided to head back to @entity6			1
but it got us thinking … whatever happened to the player - manager ? the man who would call the shots and occasionally turn to himself when all else failed ? they are a dying breed			1
@entity14 gave himself 20 minutes of playing time for @entity15 at the end of last season – 20 more than @entity18 afforded himself at @entity19 in the same campaign – and you have to go back to 2000 , when @entity22 led @entity23 for two matches , to find the previous @entity26 player - manager			1
here , @entity27 has a look at some good and bad player - managers from down the years			1
@entity30 the past 40 years have contained not one but two @entity19 surges from bottom division to top			2
the first of those was led by @entity30 , who was so keen to get into coaching that he took his badges at 18			0
having enjoyed a stellar playing career that included a @entity39 win with @entity40 , he became @entity19 ’s player - manager in 1978 , aged 28			1
he led them from the @entity43 to the top flight in four seasons , during which he actually scored the goal that clinched promotion to the second division			0
@entity30 ( left ) pictured with @entity50 during the pair 's time at @entity19 in the 1980 - 81 season @entity54 the @entity40 legend certainly pulled his weight			1
he took over as player - manager from @entity58 in 1985 and in his first season won the @entity60 and @entity61			1
poetically , he also scored the goal that sealed the league title			0
he went on to score six goals in 18 games the next season ( 1986 - 87 ) , but willingly sacrificed himself to bring younger players through and only played twice in the 1987 - 88 campaign as @entity40 won their 17th title			2
he made his final league appearance in 1990 , aged 39			0
@entity40 player - manager @entity54 poses with the @entity61 ( left ) and the league trophy in 1986 @entity72 @entity72 rounded off his remarkable playing career by turning out 50 times for @entity75 over a five - year spell as their player - manager			1
they won three league titles and three @entity81 under @entity72 , who retained his fiery side in the role			0
recalling a huge row he had in 1989 with @entity86 tea lady , @entity85 , he said : ‘ my marriage had hit problems , i was living in a big house in @entity90 on my own , i was getting followed everywhere , i was banned from the touchline			0
then the tipping point came when we went to @entity86			2
‘ we 'd been there earlier in the season and there had been an incident with the tea - lady			2
then we went back again for a night game and there was another incident			2
the boys were cleaning their boots in the dressing room and she took exception to that			0
she stormed up to see her chairman and i followed up behind her			0
i had an argument with their chairman and i knew within myself that i was ready to explode			0
’ @entity75 player - manager @entity72 ( right ) pictured with his assistant @entity112 ( left ) in 1991 @entity113 the first in a line of three successive @entity117 player - managers			1
@entity113 had been player - manager at @entity118 in the early @entity119 and took them to the @entity26 via back - to - back promotions , including a goal in the 1993 play - off final			1
he followed promotion by taking the same dual role with @entity117 and in his first season led them to the @entity61 final			0
@entity113 also reached the @entity130 semi-final and signed @entity131			1
@entity117 player - manager @entity113 looks on as his side beat @entity134 2 - 0 in the 1994 @entity61 semi-final @entity131 iconic and magnificent as a player , @entity131 was initially a success in management			1
he took over at @entity117 after @entity113 left to manage @entity139 in his first season won the 1997 @entity61 , even though he did not play in the final			2
in doing so , he became the first @entity142 manager to win the trophy and also landed @entity117 ’s first significant silverware in 26 years			2
he was controversially sacked in 1998 , with chairman @entity145 reportedly saying : ‘ i did n't like his arrogance – in fact i never liked him			0
’ @entity117 player - manager @entity149 ( back centre ) joins in the celebrations after winning the 1997 @entity61 @entity152 just as @entity113 was replaced by a man he signed , so was gullit			1
he took over as player - manager with @entity117 in the semi-finals of the @entity157 and quarter - finals of the @entity130 and he won both			1
in winning the latter aged 33 , @entity152 made history as the youngest manager to win a @entity163 competition – a distinction he held until @entity165 won the @entity166 in 2011			2
the following season , @entity117 finished third , which was their highest placing since 1970			0
@entity152 scored against @entity168 in his final competitive appearance for @entity117 at the last game of that 1998 - 99			2
@entity152 ( right ) on the training pitch during his time as @entity117 player - manager in 1999 @entity174 responsible for one notable managerial mishap when he took his first foray into the business as player - manager of @entity179 in december 1996			1
having replaced @entity181 , who had resigned , his task was to lift @entity179 off the bottom of the @entity26			0
his first game was at home against @entity185 and he was delighted with his attempt at selecting a team , until his wife pointed out he had picked 11 outfield players and no goalkeeper			0
he was manager of the month in january but moved aside for @entity191 in march 1997			0
he played on for five more years			2
@entity174 , then player - manager of @entity179 , salutes the crowd before a match in 1996 @entity194 a @entity197 winner as a player , a politician and a general manager of a club who once sacked his old team - mate @entity203 – it is only fitting that the former @entity205 striker will have held the player - manager role at some point			1
in october 2007 , he was appointed player manager at @entity209 in @entity205 and scored 15 goals , aged 41			2
he then tested positive for a drug that can act as a masking agent for anabolic steroids , though he claimed it was for an anti-baldness treatment			0
he was later sacked over a row with his bosses about interference in team selection			0
@entity209 player - manager @entity194 gives instructions to his players during a match in october 2007 @entity223 @entity223 was playing park football in @entity225 when a friend of a friend called and asked if he fancied a few games for @entity229 in 2012			1
he became player - manager , telling sportsmail that year : ‘ i am not ready to stop			1
i might go on to be a great manager , but really i want to have few more games right now			0
i do n’t want to be paid for this , not a dime			0
one afternoon , he sent his team bus to pick up supporters stranded on the hard shoulder of a motorway			0
he also gave himself the no 1 shirt , despite playing midfield , and picked up three red cards in eight games at the start of the 2013 - 14 season			0
he resigned in january 2014			0
@entity223 , then player - manager of @entity229 , on the pitch during a @entity249 match in december 2012 @entity14 the last man to try the role in the @entity26 when he briefly took the reins from @entity253 last season			1
@entity18 had a similar role at @entity19 last season , but never played , while @entity14 limited himself to 20 minutes in his final game			1
@entity15 interim manager @entity14 speaks with @entity257 and @entity258 in april 2014			1

@entity0 was at one point the *bookmakers* ' favourite for the @entity2 manager 's job

@entity14 played for just 20 minutes during his spell as interim manager at @entity15
@entity54 , @entity131 and @entity113 are among those featured as we look back at player - managers from down the years
