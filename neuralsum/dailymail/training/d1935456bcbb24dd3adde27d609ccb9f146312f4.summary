by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 11:16 est , 18 october 2013 an @entity2 teacher has been fired from a catholic school because she married her lesbian lover			0
the principal of mount st mary school , in @entity5 , is alleged to have phoned @entity8 on her wedding day in order to fire her			1
@entity11 claimed she had found out about the union ' through the diocese ' and , according to mrs @entity8 , told her : ' i never thought this day would come , but i have to terminate you			1
' @entity17 girls school in @entity5 , @entity2 , called one of its teachers on her wedding day to tell her she was being fired after finding out her bride was a lesbian it has been reported that the @entity24 teacher , who had been at the school for 15 years , was offered a ' glowing recommendation ' letter and told she could voluntarily resign			1
mrs @entity8 wed @entity28 in @entity29 on wednesday , as the state has previously legalised gay marriage			2
but 45 minutes after the ceremony @entity33 was called by a school secretary and warned not to go through with the engagement which they had apparently learned about ' through the diocese '			1
later ms @entity11 called back and , after confirming the wedding had taken place , fired mrs @entity8			1
mrs @entity8 claims that the school knew that she was a lesbian and was aware of her relationship , which started just a year after she joined			1
mrs @entity8 has since said she will not be returning to the school and is not listed as a staff member on their website			2
the former @entity45 said : ' it is impossible to believe that the first call we received after the most joyous occasion of our lives was a vocal pink slip			0
' @entity8 has been a beloved teacher at @entity52 for 15 years and it ’s a sad day when she is fired for doing nothing more than committing to the person she loves – me			2
' the school were not told about the ceremony and say they found out ' through the diocese ' the school is replying on a clause in its contract which states that staff can be dismissed for leading a lifestyle contrary to church teachings			1
when mrs @entity8 asked how her marriage had violated the clause , @entity11 responded by saying she was n't going to have a theological debate and that there was nothing else she could do			1
@entity28 added : ' they hire people who are n't catholic , with a lot of different belief systems			0
what 's upsetting to me is that the morality clause covers birth control , premarital sex and they are certainly not pro-choice			0
' it 's disturbing to me that no straight teacher is called in and asked if she 's using birth control or unmarried and having premarital sex with a boyfriend			0
' no law protects @entity8 from being fired as a religious institution citing church teaching would be exempt from discrimination laws			2
@entity89 president @entity88 said : ' to fire a beloved teacher simply because she is gay is morally reprehensible			0
' at a moment when @entity94 is urging the @entity96 hierarchy to put aside judgment and a decades - long campaign targeting devoted @entity99 , it ’s shameful that this school is ignoring that hopeful message in favor of explicit and baseless discrimination			0
' @entity11 and school president @entity104 have previously been unavailable for comment			2
