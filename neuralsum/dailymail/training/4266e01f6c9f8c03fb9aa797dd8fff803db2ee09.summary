a new dinosaur species may be the largest land predator ever discovered in @entity2			1
the beast , found in @entity4 , is estimated to have been up to 10 metres long and weighing in at between four and five tons			1
it would have been one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs from the @entity9 era , according to findings published in the journal @entity12			0
fearsome : the enormous creature , named @entity15 gurney , was discovered in @entity16 , @entity4			1
it was more than 30ft ( 10m ) long and had razor - sharp 4in ( 10cm ) - long teeth scientists discovered bones belonging to the dinosaur north of @entity16			1
they were originally believed to be @entity15 , a dinosaur species from @entity24			1
torvosaurs were a type of carnivorous dinosaur that lived between 153 and 148 million years ago during the later part of the @entity9			0
they are only known to have lived in what is now @entity31 and @entity4			2
@entity15 was a large , heavily built , bipedal predator that could grow to a length of about 32ft ( 10m )			1
it was among the largest carnivores of its time - with some specimens measuring up to 36ft ( 11m ) long			0
the species is thought to have had short but very powerful arms			0
however , closer comparison of the shin bone , upper jawbone , teeth , and partial tail vertebrae suggested to the researchers that it may warrant a new species name , @entity15			1
co-authors @entity46 and @entity48 , from @entity49 and @entity50 , said @entity51 had blade - shaped teeth up to 10 cm long , which indicates it may have been at the top of the food chain in the @entity56 roughly 150 million years ago			2
they said the number of teeth , as well as size and shape of the mouth , may differentiate the @entity2 and the @entity63			0
an artist 's impression of a @entity15 gurneyi as the fossilised remains of what scientists believe is the largest land dinosaur ever to have roamed @entity2 one of the original upper mouth palates of the @entity15 is pictured			2
@entity51 had blade - shaped teeth up to 10 cm long , which indicates it may have been at the top of the food chain the bones were found in @entity16 , @entity4 the fossil of the upper jaw of @entity76 has 11 or more teeth , while @entity51 has fewer than 11			1
the mouth bones also have a different shape and structure			0
the new dinosaur is the second species of @entity63 to be named			0
phd student @entity46 said : ' this is not the largest predatory dinosaur we know			0
' @entity86 , @entity87 , and @entity88 from the @entity89 were bigger animals			0
' with a skull of 115 centimetres , @entity15 was however one of the largest terrestrial carnivores at this epoch , and an active predator that hunted other large dinosaurs , as evidenced by blade shape teeth up to 10cms			2
' he said fossil evidence of closely - related dinosaurs suggest that the predator may have already been covered with proto - feathers			0
recently described dinosaur embryos from @entity4 are also ascribed to the new species of @entity63			2

the beast , found in @entity4 , is estimated to have been up to 10 metres long and weighing in at between four and five tons the bones were originally thought to belong to @entity15 ( illustrated ) , a dinosaur species from @entity24			1
but a closer look the shin bone , upper jawbone , teeth , and partial tail vertebrae suggested that the creature may warrant a new species name , @entity15			1

bones originally thought to belong to @entity15 , a @entity119 species
but closer comparison of the shin bone , upper jawbone , teeth , and partial tail vertebrae suggested that it may warrant a new species name
creature , named @entity15 gurney , was discovered in @entity16 , @entity4
it was more than 33ft ( 10m ) long and had razor - sharp 4in ( 10cm ) - long teeth
