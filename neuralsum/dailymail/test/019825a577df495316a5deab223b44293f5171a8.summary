@entity1 's @entity0 is just four games into a new season , but already the behaviour of its players is hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons after a player appeared to stamp on an opponent 's face			1
videos of the @entity13 defender @entity12 , who plays for @entity14 , have gone viral after he allegedly brutally stamped on the face of opponent @entity16			2
@entity14 are ninth in the @entity0 and furious claims have been made that the 23 - year - old deliberately committed the horrific foul after being jostled by 11th - placed @entity21 player @entity16			0
@entity12 ( left ) and @entity16 ( right ) fight it out for the ball on the wing during a @entity0 clash after @entity16 went down , it is alleged that @entity12 stamped down on the face of his fallen opponent despite the vicious looking nature of @entity32 ’s apparent attack and @entity16 ’s dramatic clutch to his face , the defender only received a yellow card and was allowed to play on , much to the fans ' uproar			0
whether or not the foul was intentional , it is suspected that the reason for @entity43 fans ’ outcry is not so much the act itself , but the fact that it was committed by a @entity13 player			0
@entity12 's boot appears to scrape down @entity16 's face , but the man on the floor came out as the winner later @entity12 was somehow only shown a yellow card for the challenge that infuriated fans at the stadium some @entity43 fans have demanded not only the expulsion of @entity12 , but of all @entity13 , from the game			1
however , regardless of the controversy , justice - to some extent - was served when the supposed stamped - on player ’s team won 3 - 1 , with @entity16 among the goals .			2

@entity12 has been *accused* of stamping on an opponent 's face
video *footage* appears to show @entity12 's foot scraping @entity16 's face
@entity16 was among the goals in a 3 - 1 win for his @entity21 side
