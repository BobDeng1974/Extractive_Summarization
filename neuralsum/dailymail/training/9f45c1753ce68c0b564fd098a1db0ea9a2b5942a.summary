the number of lamps being turned off or set to shine less brightly has risen to 1.36million , compared with just 148,000 in may 2010 when the @entity14 came to power			0

it found that 558,000 are now being switched off at night , eight times as many as in may 2010			2
a further 797,000 are being dimmed , ten times as many as when the @entity14 came to power			0

the survey revealed that 558,000 are now being switched off at night , eight times as many as in may 2010 @entity80 , the party 's local government spokesman said , ' @entity83 has been plunged in to darkness ' @entity80 , the party 's communities and local government spokesman , said : ' street lights ensure that people are safe on our roads and feel safe walking home , especially at this time of the year when the nights have drawn in			1
' our research shows however that significant areas of @entity83 have been plunged into darkness since may 2010 as a result of @entity98 and @entity76 ' policies			0
@entity76 has even boasted that he ' loves ' switching off street lights , which will do nothing to reassure people walking home in the dark			2
' @entity98 and @entity76 need to tell their shire councils to get their act together and do what forward - thinking authorities are already doing by investing in new technologies like led lights to save money on electricity bills and keep residents safe			2

' in a time when we are on the cusp with regards to our electricity supply , we ca n't have lights burning all night on the off chance someone wants to get out and do aerobics at 3am , ' he said , adding that turning lights off had ' decreased crime because burglars love ambient lighting '			0
however , a review by @entity146 criminologists in 2008 concluded that ' improved street lighting should continue to be used to prevent crime in public areas '			0
other studies found an average 20 per cent decrease in crime in well - lit areas			2
the @entity43 has warned that low lighting makes fatal accidents more likely at night			0
@entity43 president @entity156 said : ' roads that are safe when lit can be unsafe with the lights off			0
lighting illuminates hazards and gives road users a greater chance of avoiding them			0
' but communities minister @entity164 said : ' this is complete hypocrisy from the @entity32 , given when in government , the likes of @entity167 and @entity80 bullied and cajoled councils into cutting street lights as part of their climate change zealotry			1
