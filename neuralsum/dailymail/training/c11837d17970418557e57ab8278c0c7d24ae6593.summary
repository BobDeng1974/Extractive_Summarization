the number of aggrieved workers bringing sex discrimination claims to employment tribunals has tumbled by 90 per cent in a year since claimants were made to pay a fee			1
it appears that the prospect of forking out in advance – and losing the money if their case fails – is deterring many of those who may be tempted to use a tribunal to make their employer pay compensation			0
but @entity17 business spokesman @entity16 has promised to abolish the fees , claiming they are unfair			1
costs : it appears that the prospect of paying in advance – and losing the money if their case fails – is deterring many who may be tempted to use a tribunal to make their employer pay compensation			0
file picture figures published yesterday by the @entity30 showed there were 6,310 sex discrimination cases in the three months before the charges were introduced in july last year			1
during the same period of this year , there were just 591 – a 90 per cent fall			2
race discrimination claims are down 60 per cent , from 1,089 to 422			1
overall , 44,334 claims of all types were made to tribunals between april and june 2013			2
by this spring the figure was just 8,540 – a fall of 81 per cent			2
the situation contrasts sharply with that in 2008			0
then , sex discrimination cases were running at almost 27,000 a year , just before the recession made jobs more valuable and claims less common			1
in the financial year that ended last march , there were still 18,814 claims made			0
but the new fee system is having such an impact that there will be fewer than 2,500 made this year if the pattern of this spring continues			0
workers who want to bring a tribunal case in a straightforward argument over an employers ’ alleged failure to pay them their proper wages now have to pay a fee of £ 390			1
discrimination cases , most of which involve allegations of sex or race bias , cost £ 1,200			1
the poorest claimants can have their fees waived or reduced			0
if claimants win , the tribunal can order the employer to cover the cost of their fees			2
but if they lose , they must foot the bill themselves			0
the fees have been welcomed by employers , who face an average cost of £ 8,500 each time a case is brought			1
but they have produced a wave of protests from union leaders , lawyers and @entity17 politicians			2
earlier this week , mr @entity16 told the @entity86 a @entity17 government would abolish the fee system and replace it with a means - test one that ‘ ensures all workers have proper access to justice ’			1
@entity91 , head of employment law at legal firm @entity93 , said : ‘ we really have reached the situation where many voices are coming together to say something must be done			0
‘ there is now a serious question of access to justice on account of the level at which fees were introduced			1
it can be no coincidence that @entity16 took the opportunity at this week ’s @entity86 conference to propose a new system for dealing with this issue			0
’ but @entity112 justice minister @entity111 said : ‘ hard - working taxpayers should not be picking up the bill for employment disputes in tribunals , and it is reasonable to expect people to contribute towards the £ 74million bill for the service			2
’ he added : ‘ it is important to remember the government has taken measures to ensure that those who have limited means ... are not excluded from seeking redress in tribunals			0
‘ the government is on the side of people who want to work hard and get on			0

cases brought on race or sex claims cost aggrieved workers £ 1,200
race discrimination claims are down 60 per cent following change
