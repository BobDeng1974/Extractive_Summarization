as it became clear that the ship was sinking , dozens of people on board the ship made the decision to try and swim to safety , but many did not make it			2
the conditions were so horrendous that lifeboats from nearby towns struggled for days to reach the ship , however they were eventually able to rescue 144 men and women			1

people aboard the 15 - boat flotilla of lifeboats sailed to the wreckage site to pay their respects by lowering wreathes into the water			2

@entity103 said : ' it 's a great privilege to be here to share in this very special occasion			0
' even though i never knew @entity107 and his incredible story was n't one i learned about until fairly recently , i felt it was important to be here to pay my respects to him and all the other people who died on the @entity35			0
' he added : ' this has been a great honour			0
' also launched as part of the flotilla was historic lifeboat the @entity125 , which , 100 years ago , was lowered on a rope into the crashing waves in a bid to rescue the 229 people on board the @entity35			1
the @entity125 was one of six vessels which carried out the three - day mission to save the passengers			0
one of the first motor lifeboats , the @entity136 - the only vessel able to reach the last 50 survivors on board the stricken ship - also took part in the event			0
a plaque on @entity15 's @entity143 was also unveiled this weekend while a special church service was held in remembrance of the people on board the doomed vessel , names which included titanic survivor @entity150 , who also survived the disaster			1
@entity15 's @entity33 museum curator @entity152 said : ' this commemorative weekend has been a very long time in the planning and i 'm proud that we have been able to pay a fitting tribute to both those who died and to those who struggled against all the odds to rescue the survivors			2
' fortunately , the weather was kind to us			0
we have had very different conditions to those experienced 100 years ago on board the @entity35			1
' it was very moving to be able to go out to the site of the @entity35 wreck and to remember just what it must have been like for the poor souls on board the stricken vessel , some of them waiting more than two days to be rescued			0
' we must never forget stories like this one , or the people who died during one of the worst tragedies ever to take place off the @entity5 coast			2
' a plaque on @entity15 's @entity143 was also unveiled this weekend while a special church service was held in remembrance of the people on board the doomed vessel twice a survivor : @entity150 was on board the @entity187 and the @entity35 stewardess @entity150 was a stewardess on board the @entity187 when it sunk on april 14 , 1912			1
more than 1,500 people died but she , and hundreds of other people on board the doomed vessel , were rescued			0

not put off life at sea , the mother - of - five continued working on ships for the next two years			0
in 1914 , she boarded the @entity35			0
little did she know that she would be involved in another disastrous shipwreck			0
as the @entity35 sank @entity201 was brought ashore by lifeboat , and was later quoted as saying the @entity35 sinking was worse to endure than the @entity187			2
miss @entity150 , one of only five women aboard the @entity35 , was among the first 17 survivors rescued by the @entity15 lifeboatmen , which went back to rescue a further 18 before it too was smashed by the storm			2
99 years later her trunk , which was left on the ship in the panic to escape the sinking , washed ashore			2
the trunk , an intriguing relic of maritime history , was recovered by the @entity217 , after its curator , @entity218 , spotted it for sale on @entity220			0
he said : ' it ’s spooky , the fact that i have got this here now , 99 years later			0
@entity201 carried it on to the @entity35 and then she never saw it again			0
' when the sea calmed down the rocks would be crawling with people picking up items and it ’s been missing for the last 99 years until it surfaced on @entity220 for sale a month ago			2
