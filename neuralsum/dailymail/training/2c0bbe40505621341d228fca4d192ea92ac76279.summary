last month scientists spotted mysterious jets of water vapour spurting from the surface of comet @entity4			1
and now @entity6 has again spotted jets in new images - but their origin and formation still is n’t entirely obvious			1
it ’s known that as the comet approaches the sun its surface will met , expelling vapour into space , but why the vapour is appearing as jets from only certain points on the surface is unclear			1
this amazing new image reveals more jets of water vapour on @entity24 ( shown )			1
the latest mosaic of the jets was created by stitching together images from @entity6			1
@entity28 of @entity29 first spotted the jets last month but their origin and formation remains a mystery in a blog post @entity34 editor dr @entity33 explains that the four images are a montage taken on 26 september from a distance of 16.3 miles ( 26.3km ) from the comet ’s centre			1
' what we ’re seeing is the product of ices sublimating and gases escaping from inside the comet , carrying streams of dust out into space , ’ she writes			0
‘ zooming in close to the surface and to the source of this activity and it is apparent that it is originating from several discrete locations			0
’ in the image the jets can be seen travelling into space from the comet			0
the @entity6 probe will launch its @entity62 robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles ( 10km ) to @entity24			1
the 220lb ( 100kg ) lander will reach the surface on 12 november			0
it will take around seven hours to descend			0
during the descent , images will be taken and other observations of the comet 's environment will be made			0
@entity62 will make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace , using screws and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface			2
once the lander touches down , it will make a 360 ° panoramic image of the landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has landed			0
the initial science phase will then begin , with other instruments analysing the plasma and magnetic environment , and the surface and subsurface temperature			0
the lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface , delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis			0
the interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards @entity6			2
they are centered on one location , the middle of the comet , with no other part of the comet seeming to have such jets			0
this may suggest that , as the comet has orbited the sun many times before , much of its ice may have already melted			0
this would mean that only small pockets of ice melt and produce vapour in this way as it approaches - which could explain the formation of specific jets			1
as the comet approaches the sun it will become more active , and scientists will be hoping for more opportunities to view features like these			2
dr @entity33 explains : ‘ as the comet gets progressively closer to the sun along its orbit , the surface will become warmer , and the level of activity will increase , producing a vast coma around the nucleus , along with a tail			2
‘ it ’s perhaps hard to believe looking at images like this at less than 30km [ 18.6 miles ] distance from the surface , but recent gound - based images have revealed that @entity142 ’s coma already extends at least 19,000km [ 11,800 miles ] from the nucleus ! ’ in other @entity146 digital imaging professor @entity144 created a 3d model of the comet ’s surface , reports dr @entity28 from @entity29			1
his montage , using data from @entity6 ’s @entity151 , shows the comet as seen on 24 september 2014			0
he explains that the views were made by projecting images of the comet over a digital model			0
this 3d model of the comet 's surface was created by digital imaging professor @entity144			2
using data from @entity6 's @entity151 , it shows the comet as seen on 24 september as soon as @entity6 entered orbit around comet @entity4 in august , engineers rushed to find a landing site for its @entity62 lander - which they have now done			1
this is because as the comet nears the sun it will become more active , with more potentially hazardous vapour and debris released			2
and that activity was first revealed in images last month showing how the comet is indeed giving off water vapour as jets			1
drag the slider in the image below to reveal the plume jets of water vapour have been spotted in images of @entity6 's comet target			1
the material is being shot into space , but it 's unclear why it appears as ' jets '			0
@entity28 of @entity29 spotted the jets by brighting photos from @entity6 ( move the slider above to see the ' before ' and ' after ' effect ) the jets of water vapour were initially spotted by dr @entity195 last month			1
by increasing the contrast on available shots of the comet , she revealed previously hidden jets of water vapour spewing outwards			1
and scientists will be hoping to study these jets in more detail as the comet approaches the sun , and possibly work out exactly how they form and what they ’re made of			2
‘ the challenge with @entity6 's images of the comet is that until quite recently , most of them were taken with the sun nearly behind the spacecraft , ’ dr @entity28 told @entity207			1
‘ that lights up the comet 's surface very brightly compared to the much fainter comet jets			2
‘ but the jets are there ; all you have to do is brighten the image to reveal them , an operation anyone can do with the most basic photo editing software			0
‘ the work i did was to combine a brightened image of the jets with an unbrightened image of the comet , so it 's an artistic enhancement of the original image			0
‘ it 's much like a film photographer would dodge a photo to brighten some areas compared to others			0
‘ i also cleaned up some distracting specks and cosmic ray hits , which make white marks on the original photos			0
’ as @entity6 spends more time on the night side of the comet dr @entity28 says it will be easier to spot jets coming off the comet as the surface will not be so bright			1
she continues : ' every day brings the comet closer to the sun and makes it more active			0
' that will be exciting to watch , but it presents a challenge for @entity6			0
' the jets and the gas around the comet will influence @entity6 's path in unpredictable ways , making it hard for them to steer precisely , which will make it hard for them to place @entity62 where they want to put it on the surface			1
' that is one reason they 're in such a hurry to select a landing site and land @entity62 - it will get harder to achieve as the comet gets more active			1
' as the comet ( seen in this ' selfie ' with @entity6 ) approaches the sun it will become more active			2
ice remaining on the surface will melt , surrounding the comet in gas			1
for this reason engineers want to perform the planned landing of the @entity62 lander on the comet as soon as possible before too much vapour is present in november the @entity6 probe will launch its @entity62 robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles ( 10km ) to @entity24			1
if all goes to plan , @entity62 will then make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace			0
the lander will drill and collect samples from beneath the surface , delivering them to an onboard laboratory for analysis earlier this week scientists picked landing site ' @entity294 ' , shown , as the location where the @entity62 lander will touch down			1
@entity294 offers the minimum risk to the lander in comparison to the other candidate sites , and is also scientifically interesting , with signs of activity nearby in addition , while the jets are mostly made of water vapour , @entity6 ’s @entity304 ( @entity305 for the @entity307 ) instrument has also spotted expected signs of ammonia and methanol in the jets - although a lack of carbon monoxide has been a surprise			1
they are also thought to carry ice crystals and dust specks with them from the surface			0
one thing that is not known however is why the jets are actually appearing as ‘ jets ’			0
as a comet nears the sun its surface sublimates , which means the solid ice turns to gas , creating a ‘ coma ’ of material around the comet			2
why @entity6 ’s comet is only spewing material at specific points in jets , rather than across the whole surface , remains a mystery			1
' that is one of the as yet unanswered questions about comets that @entity6 's scientific data will hopefully address , ' added dr @entity28			1
‘ one thing to remember is that short - period comets like @entity4 have been baked by the sun for a long time so their surfaces are not covered with ice but rather with very dark dust			2
‘ it looks bright in @entity6 pictures only because we 're looking at a dark object against even darker space , and the camera 's exposure settings have been adjusted accordingly - try taking a digital photo of a charcoal briquet against an asphalt - covered street and see how bright the auto - exposure on your camera makes the charcoal appear ! ‘ the ice we see coming out of it is being released from the interior , through fissures or craters			2
but how this process works is n't understood , yet			0
‘ by orbiting a comet for many months and watching it become more active , @entity6 is the first mission that has a chance of answering these questions			2
’ zoom in on the image below to find out where @entity6 is at the moment			0

new images have revealed more jets of water vapour on @entity24
they were revealed in a blog post for @entity384 , *headquartered* in @entity385
the latest mosaic of the jets was created using images from @entity6
dr @entity28 of @entity29 first spotted the jets last month but their origin and formation remains a mystery
it 's known that as the comet approaches the sun the ice on its surface will melt - but why this creates jets is *unknown*
as the comet approaches the sun it will become more active
ice remaining on the surface will melt , surrounding the comet in gas
for this reason engineers want to perform the landing of the @entity62 lander on the comet as soon as possible before too much vapour is present
this could be hazardous to any landing attempt - although the vapour will be of *key* scientific interest to @entity6 throughout its mission
@entity384 's @entity6 spacecraft entered orbit around comet @entity4 in august and is now *slowly* lowering itself closer
