by @entity1 reporter published : 17:21 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 01:20 est , 9 october 2013 the students at @entity3 are among the smartest in the country so it comes as no surprise that they have the most ingenious beer pong table for when they need to break away from the books			1
a company in @entity10 , @entity11 has developed a beer pong table that self - cleans and has spouts to sanitize the ping pong balls mid-game			2
the water will be not be added to the spillage of @entity17 , as there is a gutter that collects all of the run - off			0
the custom table holds up to 215 pounds , meaning even one of the heavier co-eds would be able to jump on top without breaking it			2
a final touch that showed fraternal pride was the placement of a glow - in - the - dark decoration with the @entity41 letters making up the group 's name , @entity44			0
the spraying water wo n't damage the wood table or the well - lit sign as it has been oak stained and treated with a waterproofing sealant and covered with an additional layer of polyurethane			0
in house : the beer pong table was made for an @entity3 frat by a local engineering company that was founded by former @entity3 students wiring : the system beneath the table ( left ) allows for water to be sprayed to clean the top and the balls but a gutter ( right ) on the sides keeps that from making a mess keeping it clean : each side of the table has a spot where the players can push the balls into a tube for cleaning at the right and then it pops up ( pictured ) sanitized on the left side ' reliability and innovation were two key factors in creating this table as it was likely to be used and abused for many years with minimal maintenance , ' the company website boasts			1
the table was constructed by @entity82 and though it may appear as if it was outsourced away from students , the company is run by alums from the @entity3 so it was kept in the family			1
just because of their connections does n't mean that the table came at a bargain - basement price , however , as @entity90 reports that the table costs about $ 1,200			1
final touch : the table can hold up to 215 pounds of weight in case the game gets really rowdy			0

table was custom built for the @entity44 fraternity at @entity3
features ball sanitizing cleansers and gutters to catch the run off
table costs $ 1,200 and was made by an engineering company in @entity108
