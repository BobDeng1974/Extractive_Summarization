in scenes now seared into the fabric of a nation , state troopers in helmets and gas masks stand off against crowds of young , black protesters on the roads between @entity9 and @entity10 , @entity11			1
seconds later they charge , tear gas flowing around them			0
other frames show venerated leaders of the @entity17 marching implacably , despite the threat of harm to them and their supporters			0
the images , now fifty years old , have been assembled from the work of three photographers covering the marches , and are now being displayed in a @entity27 photography exhibition			1
@entity35 , who took the photograph , observed they were ' beaten down like dominoes ' in short order chaos : state troopers deployed tear gas against the marchers , drawing widespread outrage which contributed to the passage of the @entity46 later that year leaders : @entity48 ( center ) , @entity50 ( left ) and reverend @entity51 ( right ) are pictured above marching around the state capitol in @entity10 , @entity11 the first was @entity35 , a staff photographer for the pro-segregation @entity54 , who described dodging heavy - handed authorities , climbing rickety churches and scrapping with other journalists to get the best shots			1

high - quality images of the authorities ' brutal response helped galvanize change and push through the @entity46 just five months later			0
however , the transmission of the images was far from guaranteed - @entity35 recalled how his editors initially tried to suppress his images			1
explaining their logic , he said : ' the largely segregationist editors thought if you did n't publish it , much of this would go away '			2
but , taking the lead of other news outlets , he images were released - and helped effect a profound change in the fabric of @entity112			0
emotions running high : a minister makes a forceful point in the basement of @entity117 during the 1965 marches solidarity : this image shows @entity121 , @entity33 , @entity31 and @entity122 , with @entity124 â€™s @entity123 in the background charging : @entity11 state troopers are pictured above charing into marchers almost immeidately after giving them a two minute deadline to disperse making music : musicians @entity129 , left , and @entity131 , right , entertained demonstrators on the march in the days after @entity29 inversion : a marcher is shown above holding the @entity80 upside - down - which he said was a sign of ' distress ' brought about by the social injustices the @entity139 was facing at the time			1
