@entity6 had been enjoying a night out in @entity7 , @entity8 province , when he thought it was time to return to his b&b for the night			1
after one too many , he staggered into what he believed to be his lodgings and fell fast asleep , only to wake up the next day and realise his mistake			0
one hour before the ship was due to sail on a two - week , 11,000 - mile trip across the @entity28 , and no doubt nursing a hangover , mr @entity6 pulled out his telephone and rang everyone he knew , as well as the police , to ask for help in getting out			1
a police spokesman said : ' the container was sealed and he could n't get out so he called everyone he knew for help and called us too			2
' his problem was , though , that he could n't tell us which container he was in and there were thousands of them stacked on top of each other			0
' eventually mr @entity6 was tracked down to a container stacked 60ft in the air by hammering on its metal side as people searched the docks			2
a dock worker said : ' he 's very lucky			0
if he 'd been asleep for another hour the next stop would have been @entity20			0
