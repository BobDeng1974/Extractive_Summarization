@entity1 frontman @entity0 revealed today he has suffered from glaucoma for two decades - hence his permanent sunglasses many assumed the dark glasses worn by @entity1 frontman @entity0 were a fashion statement			1
but he has revealed the reason he dons shades is because he has suffered from glaucoma for years			1
the star said he has suffered the eye condition – which if left untreated can cause vision impairment and even blindness - for around two decades			1
until now , people put the singer 's ever - present sunglasses – which he even wore indoors – were a rock star affectation			2
but he explained during a recording of tonight 's @entity20 for @entity21 that they are to help with his vision problem			1
@entity23 can make the eyes more sensitive to light , causing sufferers to use dark glasses to alleviate difficulties			0
presenter mr @entity29 asked whether the singer ever removes his shades , to which @entity0 replied : ' this is a good place to explain to people that i 've had glaucoma for the last 20 years			1
' i have good treatments and i am going to be fine			0
' he added : ' you 're not going to get this out of your head now and you will be saying " ah , poor old blind @entity0 "			1
glaucoma is caused by a build - up of pressure in the eyeball when the fluid in the eye can not drain properly , which can damage the optic nerve			1
if left untreated , it can lead to loss of peripheral vision and ultimately complete loss of sight			1
early diagnosis can mean further sight deterioration can be prevented - with laser treatment , eye drops and surgery used to stop it worsening - but the damage to the optic nerve can not be undone			1
several things increase the risk of developing glaucoma			0
age : glaucoma becomes much more common as we get older			0
it is uncommon below the age of 40 but this type of glaucoma affects one per cent of people aged over 40			0
about five per cent of people over the age of 65 have glaucoma race : if you are of @entity75 origin you are more at risk of glaucoma			0
it is also more likely to develop at an earlier age and be more severe family : you are at a higher risk of developing glaucoma if you have a close relative who has chronic glaucoma short sight : if you are very short sighted you have a higher risk of developing chronic glaucoma diabetes : if you have diabetes you have an increased risk of developing glaucoma			0
for the most common type of glaucoma , there are no noticeable symptoms because the condition develops very slowly			2
people often do not realise their sight is being damaged because the first part of the eye to be affected is the peripheral vision			2
vision is lost from the outer rim of the eye , slowly working inwards towards the centre			2
the @entity102 band were on the @entity29 show to promote their new album , @entity105			0
the song was released commercially this week after previously being given away to half a billion @entity108 customers , a controversial move which upset some people who said they did not want it automatically added to their music libraries			0
speaking about the furore , @entity0 told mr @entity29 : ' we wanted to do something fresh but it seems some people do n't believe in @entity118			2
' all those people who were uninterested in @entity1 are now mad at @entity1			2
as far as we are concerned , it 's an improvement			0
' @entity0 revealed that the shades he continually wears help alleviate the symptoms of glaucoma			1
he is pictured here with @entity128 ceo @entity127 during the @entity128 launch last month			0

@entity1 's @entity0 reveals he wears shades because he has had glaucoma
has *secretly* suffered the condition for two decades
glaucoma is caused by a build up of pressure within the eye
this causes damage to the optic nerve which can lead to blindness
if it 's treated early enough , further damage to vision can be prevented
