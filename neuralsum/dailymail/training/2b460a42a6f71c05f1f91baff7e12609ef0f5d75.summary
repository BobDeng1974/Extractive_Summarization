for many mothers , the school run can be one of the most stressful parts of their day			0
spare a thought then for @entity5 , who faces a four - hour journey involving 12 buses to get her daughter @entity8 to and from school after the little girl was turned down by primary ten minutes from their home			1
when the four - year - old starts school in september , @entity14 , 22 , will have to take three buses from their home in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 to drop her off in @entity21 , and three buses back			1
miss @entity5 had applied to get @entity8 into the reception class at her nearest school in @entity17 , which is just 10 minutes walk from the family ’s home			1
however , the school , which has been rated ' outstanding ' by @entity38 is massively oversubscribed and she lost an appeal			2
@entity8 can not get in , even though she is already at the nursery there			2
@entity8 has now been placed on the waiting list , and at an appeal hearing @entity14 was told there is nothing she can do but wait for a place , if one becomes available			2
the school where @entity8 has been offered a place is 4.7 miles away by road , but school places are allocated ' as the crow flies ' - with that distance being 1.78 miles away			1
@entity53 : miss @entity5 will have to get her first bus at 6.50am , travelling from @entity17 to @entity55			1
from there she will go to @entity57 and finally on to @entity21 to drop off @entity8 arduous : when the four - year - old starts school in september , @entity14 , 22 , will have to take three buses from their home in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 to drop her off in @entity21 , and three buses back neither @entity14 , nor her partner @entity63 , 24 , drive			1
miss @entity5 also cares for her disabled mother , which makes her situation even more difficult			1
' we did two test runs of the journey and @entity8 was completely exhausted , ' miss @entity5 said			1
' we will be setting off just after my partner leaves for work every morning , but he will actually get home before us			0
' the full - time mother says she will have to set off at 6.40am for the 6.50am bus to be able to get @entity8 to school for 8.40am - meaning in total she will spend almost eight hours a day on buses			1
' we are having to rely on three buses , ' she said			0
' those buses run at half - hourly intervals so if one of those buses does n’t turn up we are going to be late			2
' i feel so sorry for @entity8 having to make that journey			2
i took her on the bus for a couple of taster sessions and she was so tired at the end of it ' @entity5 ' the schools are now talking about fining for lateness so that is another worry			0
i am so stressed about it			0
' because the crow flying distance is relatively low the family do not even qualify for any help with bus fares - it will cost them £ 35 a week			1
' @entity63 is looking into passing his test and if he did he would have the possibility of a work ’s van , but he still would n’t be able to take us because he sets off at different times to us , ' said miss @entity5			1
miss @entity5 said she will have to wake at about 5.30am to get ready and feed @entity30 before waking up @entity8 at 6am to get ready for school , and would not get home until after 5pm each evening			1
she said : ' when i went for the appeal i took @entity30 with me for them to see how difficult it would be for me but they did not seem to consider it would be a problem			0
' there was even a suggestion for me to walk across a canal towpath but that journey would be no good with children in tow and in dark , damp mornings and evenings			0
' there are other schools that are closer to @entity14 but , because they are also oversubscribed she has been placed on their waiting lists , and because she is further away from those , she is further down the lists			0
@entity21 is also a popular school but it has recently expanded , making places available			1
waiting game : there are other schools that are closer to @entity14 but , because they are also oversubscribed she has been placed on their waiting lists , and because she is further away from those , she is further down the lists miss @entity5 claims she did not receive an admissions form when they were sent out at the end of last year and wonders whether this could be why she did n’t get a place at her preferred school			1
she says she phoned @entity148 ’s @entity147 in november when she had not received her forms			0
' i rang the department and was told to wait and see if the forms came because there had been changes with the postal service and it was @entity157			0
i was told to call back in january , ' she said			0
' i rang back in january as the deadline for applications was nearing and was told i would be sent a form			0
' i still did n’t receive a form and made several calls between then and april to ask for forms			0
they said they could not understand why i was not receiving them and kept sending me forms out			0
' i finally received forms in april , on the same day that parents got their letters confirming school places			2
' i feel so sorry for @entity8 having to make that journey			2
i took her on the bus for a couple of taster sessions and she was so tired at the end of it			0
' and poor little @entity30 will be spending even more time on the bus			0
we are going to have no life			0
' miss @entity5 is the latest among a string of parents who have failed to be allocated slots in their nearest or chosen schools for the new school year starting this september			1
while education bosses insist every child in @entity18 does have an allocated school place , they admit they are ' acutely aware of the pressure ' on spaces			2
@entity190 , @entity148 ’s deputy director of children ’s services , said : ' we are aware that a number of parents in @entity17 have expressed concerns about securing places at local schools and we are working hard to address this			1
' this year has seen us managing an unusually high demand for places in the area which we anticipate will fall next year			1
' we will continue to talk to local schools about possible expansion and will do all we can to support parents to get places in a good school as close as possible to their home			2
' national legislation , which limits early years class sizes to no more than 30 pupils , also means that school place appeals can only be granted under exceptional circumstances			0
' he stressed the importance of parents completing their applications on time as this is ' vital ' in helping secure places at preferred schools			0
miss @entity5 also expressed concern that a major new 180 - house development planned for @entity17 will add additional strain to school places in the area			1
however , the council said no decision has yet been made regarding planning permission for the new scheme and discussions are ongoing with the developers to ensure full community contributions from the developer regarding education provision are secured			0
@entity18 faces a potential shortfall of more than 4,000 primary school places within three years .			1
