the giving and receiving of gifts is considered to be an important part of the @entity189 ’s work in developing good relations with other countries – although courtiers are supposed to discourage the offering of presents of high monetary value			0
any jewels received by members of the @entity189 are not , officially , considered to be their personal property , because otherwise they would be taxable			0
