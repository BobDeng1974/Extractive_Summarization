a couple who met and fell in love while playing the roles of @entity3 and @entity4 in a production of @entity4 have become parents			1
@entity7 was born last month and his parents , who have returned to the stage for this year 's pantomime season , could n't be more delighted			2
@entity11 and @entity12 have also begun to prepare their son for a life on the stage , with the baby cared for backstage during performances			2
delighted : @entity7 and @entity19 , with their baby son @entity7 , met while starring in a pantomime but it has n't all been easy for the couple , who come from @entity26 , after @entity27 was initially diagnosed with two forms of dwarfism - a @entity30 first - while mrs @entity19 was still pregnant			1
so severe was the initial diagnosis , she was advised to have a termination			0
luckily , when the baby was born he was healthy and doctors say he will lead a normal life			0
' we are so lucky , ' his delighted mother said in an interview with the @entity41 on sunday			0

worrying : their son was initially diagnosed with two types of dwarfism but will live a normal life relieved : 24 - year - old @entity19 says she is ' so lucky ' to have her husband and baby son adorable : tiny @entity27 is currently spending his days watching his parents in action back in action : the couple ( left , pictured with fellow cast members ) have reprised their roles this year indeed , mrs @entity19 was so shy , she was afraid to even speak to her 35 - year - old future husband - despite the instant attraction			1
' when i first saw @entity7 playing @entity3 , my heart skipped a beat , ' she revealed			1
' i 'd never seen anyone so handsome and i instantly fancied him			0
' i got butterflies in my stomach the first time i went into rehearsal and saw him			0
' luckily for the enamoured mrs @entity19 , now husband @entity7 felt the same way and the couple got engaged in april last year			2
' i never imagined he would look twice at me , ' added a thrilled mrs @entity73			0
