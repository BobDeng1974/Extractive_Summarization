a rare letter penned by firebrand civil rights protester @entity2 shortly after he converted to @entity3 and changed his name is expected to fetch $ 20,000 when it goes under the hammer			1
the six - page note , written in 1950 , is one of the earliest known examples of the black power campaigner using the @entity2 moniker for which he would later become famous			2
in the letter , written from inside jail , he discusses his love for the @entity16 music scene , and jazz in particular , while grappling with the demons of his ' sinful past '			1
historic : this letter , written in 1950 by @entity2 as he was in jail , discusses his love for jazz music , his ' fear ' about returning to that sinful life , and is one of the first times he signed using ' x ' instead of his last name the activist , who was born @entity2 , was sent to prison in 1946 for larceny and breaking and entering after a life of petty crime and trouble with the law			1
but once in prison he discovered @entity3 and joined the @entity39 , dropping his ' slave ' last name and adopting the letter ' @entity29 ' , symbolic of a stolen identity , in its place			2
@entity2 worked in jazz clubs as a youth , but after being jailed he converted to @entity3 , renounced his former life , and became a civil rights campaigner the letter , which will be auctioned later this month by @entity51 in @entity16 , is addressed from prison to an unknown member of the @entity55 movement			1
in it , @entity2 discusses his love of jazz music , calling the musicians ' wielders of souls ' , and praising its ' comforting effects '			1
however , he also admits that he fears ' the temptations of that life and its memories ' , adding : ' i steer as far clear from the subject as possible unless i know the fellows are brothers [ @entity70 ]			0
' in the note he asks his fellow believer to send him a list of all the jazz musicians he knows that follow @entity3 so he can also write to them from his cell			2
at the end of the note , he signs ' as @entity78 , your brother , @entity2 ' , one of the first known instances where he used his new name			0
as @entity78 is a standard greeting or farewell in @entity3 , and literally translates as ' peace be upon you ' , but is usually interpreted as ' hello ' or ' goodbye ' when used in this context			0
after he was paroled from prison in 1952 @entity2 went on to challenge the mainstream non-violent civil rights movement of @entity90 instead he called on his followers to defend themselves from white aggression ' by any means necessary ' , and advocated black rifle clubs			0
his fundamental belief , taken from the teachings of @entity96 , was that the white man was the devil , and that blacks could never live in harmony with whites			0
his autobiography , and numerous public speeches , formed the basis for the black power movement which gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s .			0
