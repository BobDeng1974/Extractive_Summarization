one - year - old @entity8 was born after social services in @entity10 applied to the courts to forcibly deliver her because of fears over mother @entity15 's mental health			1
the shocking case , which was at first shrouded in secrecy , led to the country 's top family judge , sir @entity18 , to call for family courts to be more open			1
@entity15 was forced to undergo a caesarean after coming to the @entity6 for a training course and her daughter was taken into care the senior judge has now disclosed that he made an adoption order for the child earlier this month , meaning miss @entity15 is unlikely to see her daughter until she is 18			1
following the forced caesarean , miss @entity15 accused the family courts of ' invading my body and stealing my baby '			1
she added : ' something very unfair has been done to me			0
i am fighting to get my daughter back and i never want another innocent mother in your country to suffer as i have			0
' but in her last message to the court last month , miss @entity41 , who has not seen her daughter since may 2013 , did not challenge the adoption			2
sir @entity18 , @entity44 , said the case demonstrated the ' pressing need for radical changes ' in the family courts and @entity49 she wrote : ' me personally , i am trying to forget this bad experience i had in @entity52			0
i love my daughter and i pray to see her one day again			0
' child p , who can not be identified for legal reasons , was born in august 2012 , two months after miss @entity15 was sectioned under the @entity56			1

the @entity49 then gave the trust permission for doctors to carry out a caesarean section and the newborn child was taken into care by @entity10 social services			1
the following october , @entity71 was given court permission to place @entity8 for adoption , and in november 2013 she went to live with a couple , who have now formally adopted her			2
sir @entity18 said both @entity79 and the child 's father , who has never seen her , were sent written notice and emailed by the county council about the adoption hearing on april 1 , but did not attend and were not represented			0

the judge said : ' mr and mrs @entity96 are good and loving people			0
they are admirably equipped to meet @entity8 's needs now and in the future			0
@entity8 is obviously thriving in their care and doing very well			0
' in all the circumstances , @entity8 's welfare throughout her life requires - demands - that she be adopted			0

details of the @entity49 's decision in the case were originally kept secret he added : ' this case must surely stand as final , stark and irrefutable demonstration of the pressing need for radical changes in the way in which both the family courts and @entity49 approach what , for shorthand , i shall refer to as transparency			2
' since the judge 's comments last december , there has been increase in the number of family judgments made available to journalists and the media			1
details of the @entity49 decision to allow a caesarian section remained secret for months , and there was a long delay in the public learning a judge had declared that doctors should be allowed to force ms @entity15 to have a caesarian section because a natural delivery risked rupturing her womb			1
the judge had said there were concerns that if ms @entity15 was uncooperative when she went into labour , doctors would be unable to monitor the baby 's heartbeat and to see whether ms @entity15 's womb might rupture			0
he authorised ' reasonable restraint ' to perform the c - section safely .			0
