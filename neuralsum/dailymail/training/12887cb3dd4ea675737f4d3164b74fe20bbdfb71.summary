sometimes it can really feel like the heavens are smiling down on you			0
that was certainly the case for @entity5 and his team at @entity7 who spotted this upside down rainbow during a morning ’s rowing on the @entity11			1
‘ we ’d just put the boat on the water and were about to set off when we just looked up and noticed it , ’ the 65 - year - old businessman said yesterday			1
‘ none of us knew what it was			0
it was the same colours as a rainbow , but upside down			2
there was a lot of head scratching as we marvelled at it			0
‘ the striking thing was it was really high up in the sky and the clarity of the colour was intense and far more distinct than you see in a normal rainbow			2
above the arc , the sky was clear blue			1
@entity35 side there were two columns of cloud and the arc just hung between those columns			2
‘ it made me think of a rope ladder like you might see across a massive ravine in a film like @entity46 , but this was a beautiful rope ladder between columns of cloud			2
’ @entity51 : the upside down rainbow - known as a circumzenithal arc - witnessed by @entity5 hanging over the river @entity11 the dazzling vision witnessed by mr @entity5 , who photographed it on his smartphone , is in fact called a circumzenithal arc by scientists			1
in non-science terms , they only happen way up high and when skies are blue , and when ice crystals are around			0
unlike a rainbow , the sky has to be clear of rain and low cloud for them to be seen			1
even then , the arc only appears when a low sun shines at a specific angle through a thin veil of cirrus clouds at 20,000 - 25,000ft			1
at this altitude clouds are made of ice crystals , the size of grains of salt , which when lined up horizontally refract and deflect the light into an arc mirroring the sun. mr @entity5 , of @entity83 , photographed this one around 10am last tuesday , alongside the branches of an ancient oak tree			1
he and his fellow rowers then completed their 6 mile training trip			0
‘ when we got back i felt we ’d really earned that smile , ’ he said			0
‘ afterwards i looked up what it was on the internet and discovered sightings are quite rare			0
‘ this one was very , very clear and all the more impressive as the landing stage is near the walls of @entity97			0
’ a @entity99 spokesman said : ‘ @entity109 arcs , sometimes known as @entity111 ’ arcs , are formed when sunlight refracts through horizontal ice crystals at such an angle that the light enters the crystal through its flat top face and exits through a side prism face causing the distinctive upside - down rainbow effect			2
‘ they are commonly associated with cirrus clouds where ice crystals readily form			0
‘ @entity116 arcs are actually quite common as these types of clouds occur throughout the year , however we only sometimes see them as they are usually obscured by clouds underneath			0
‘ in order to be able to see a circumzenithal arc , a combination of atmospheric conditions must coincide just right			1
the height , depth and position of the ice clouds must be right as the cloud needs to be at a specific angle convex to the sun. ‘ the position of the observer is also important since its visibility can vary greatly over short distances			1

@entity5 , a 65 - year - old businessman , photographed the dazzling vision as he rowed with friends on the @entity11
the *inverted* rainbow is in fact called a circumzenithal arc by scientists and only appears in very rare conditions
the sky has to be clear of rain and low cloud , and the sun must shine at a specific angle for them to be seen
