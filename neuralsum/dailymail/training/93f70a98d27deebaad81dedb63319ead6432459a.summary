by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 01:58 est , 25 october 2012 @entity1 could face a multibillion - dollar fine after being charged with breaking @entity4 competition rules			1
the @entity6 software giant has been accused of failing to fulfill a pledge made three years ago to allow users of its flagship @entity11 software equal access to rival web browsers			1
@entity1 had agreed to the condition in order to settle an @entity4 investigation - and avoid a fine of up to 10 percent of its annual turnover			2
dispute : @entity1 faces a hefty fine after being charged by the @entity21 with breaking a promise to give users of its @entity11 software equal access to rival web browsers ( pictured : the firm 's chairman , @entity26 ) but the @entity21 , which acts as competition watchdog in the @entity4 , said the firm had failed to fulfill this agreement between february 2011 and july this year			1
the decision by @entity32 , the @entity4 's antitrust commissioner , opens the firm up to a substantial fine for defying the terms of the settlement - reached in 2009			2
mr @entity32 warned that when a company enters into commitments - ' they must do what they are committed to do or face the consequences			0
' ' companies should be deterred from any temptation to renege on promises or even to neglect their duty , ' he told a news briefing			0
he said he had also warned @entity1 about access to rival browsers on @entity49 , the latest version of the company 's flagship product which will be released on friday			1
' we have been in contact with them regarding @entity49			0
i have precisely transmitted ... what are my concerns , what kind of presentation should be avoided if they do n't want to take the risk of a new investigation , ' he said			0
warning : the firm has also been warned to provide access to rival web browsers via its new @entity49 software - which will be released on friday a sanction could top $ 7.4 billion or 10 percent of its revenues for the fiscal year ending june 30 , 2012 - but the final figure is expected to be lower , as the infringement covered a relatively short period of time			1
@entity1 , which has been penalised 1.36 billion euros ( $ 1.76 billion ) in the last decade for infringing @entity4 rules , apologised			1
it has four weeks to reply to the @entity21 's ' statement of objections			0
' ' although this was the result of a technical error , we take responsibility for what happened , and we are strengthening our internal procedures to help ensure something like this can not happen again , ' the company said in a statement			0
mr @entity32 told the briefing he had no reason to go after @entity1 's operating system for tablets , a market that includes rivals @entity92 and @entity94			0
' we have looked at @entity95 and , on the basis of our investigation so far , there are no grounds to pursue further investigation on this particular issue , ' he said			0
the @entity21 said in july that several companies had accused @entity1 of only allowing its own internet explorer browser to be installed on devices running @entity11 8 on @entity95 tablets			1
with the @entity1 case heading for resolution , the next battle for the @entity21 is likely to be with @entity94 , the target of complaints by @entity1 and more than a dozen other rivals over its core search engine business			2
the world 's most popular search engine is now in talks with the @entity4 watchdog that could help it avoid sanctions which could amount to some $ 4 billion .			2
