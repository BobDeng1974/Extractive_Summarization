you have to hand it to @entity2 because he has certainly seen off some threats in his 16 years as a professional at @entity5			1
some , such as the @entity8 @entity7 winner @entity6 , @entity9 and @entity10 , were more serious than others			0
@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 maybe not so much , but they were all brought in to the club under @entity2 ’s watch			2
better than ever : @entity2 has been remarkable this season , featuring in all of @entity5 's @entity20 games @entity2 , in his 16th season as a professional footballer with @entity5 , remains			1
he is probably playing better than ever			0
little wonder , then , that he is agitating for news of another contract at @entity26			0
they are certainly making him sweat			0
@entity28 , who is @entity30 ’s eyes and ears around the place , appears to have enjoyed the moment she told @entity2 that the club have a new policy in place			2
out of nowhere , it appears any one by the name of @entity2 will only be offered one year contracts now that he is over 30 years of age			2
he is panicking a bit , probably with good reason after putting himself in pole position to be @entity5 ’s player of the year			2
perhaps @entity28 , who is a member of the football club board at @entity5 , remembers the last time she was involved in negotiations with @entity2 back in july 2009			1
more on that in a moment because the unsavoury slog through the media that summer put a few noses out of joint			0
back to where it all matters , though , and his performances on the pitch			0
football clubs will pretty much forgive anything - and there has been much to forgive in this case - so long as they perform out on the pitch			0
@entity2 is not only the best central defender in @entity5 ’s history , but he is also unrivalled in two decades of the @entity20			1
he is the best there has been			0
it was only a couple of weeks ago when @entity2 ’s 600th appearance in a @entity5 shirt was being commemorated before their @entity20 clash with @entity71			1
‘ an incredible achievement by a guy who has given everything for a club for many , many years and continues to do so , ’ cooed his manager @entity72 in his programme notes			2
@entity2 , 33 , has played in all 22 @entity20 fixtures for @entity5 this season and he will captain the team against @entity81 on wednesday			1
he has realigned his game , handing marking duties to his partner @entity84 and using his positioning , which has always been his best attribute , to dictate the game			0
colossus : @entity6 was another robust @entity5 centre half and @entity26 favourite another stalwart : @entity92 's game at @entity71 , @entity81 and @entity93 has been exceptional back to that £ 150,000 a week contract , which expires on june 30 this year : ‘ i trust @entity2 and i think he trusts me , ’ was @entity72 ’s take on the situation last friday			1
last time round , when he was working off pay - as - you - go mobile phones to flirt with @entity99 in 2009 , he tucked up one or two people on the way to securing a five year deal with @entity5			2
still , you live and learn			0
at the time he was so powerful at @entity5 it was untrue : he used to take his kids swimming at the club ’s @entity107 training base as if it was his own personal leisure centre			1
but over the years , with each lurid appearance on the front page of a tabloid newspaper , his authority at the club has slowly eroded			0
he remains captain , but he has had to keep his nose clean over the past couple of years			0
there has been the odd blip , such as the announcement that he was ready to play for @entity121 again on the flight home from @entity123 on april 25 last year , but that ’s about it			0
to be fair to him , if he could put one or two personal issues with the @entity127 to one side , he would play for @entity121 at this summer ’s @entity7 finals			1
top man : @entity2 ( right ) has been a mainstay in @entity72 's @entity5 teams while at @entity5 trophy hunter : @entity2 proudly holds the @entity133 last season let ’s face it , @entity137 would take the country ’s best central defender at the drop of a hat if he was available for selection			1
still , the pressing issue for @entity2 at this moment is @entity5 ’s failure to offer him the contract he believes he has earned			1
if he wants a bargaining chip the next time he knocks on @entity28 ’s door , it might be worth throwing in the name of @entity152			2
on july 15 last year , a couple of months after the @entity155 captain celebrated his 33rd birthday , he signed a new two year contract			2
brick wall : @entity2 has found fine form this season since @entity72 's return at @entity26 star in the making : @entity2 ( left ) holds the @entity165 trophy back in 2000 ( left ) and ( right ) was red - carded during an @entity121 under 21 match against @entity167 ‘ it ’s great news , ’ admitted the @entity155 captain as he prepared for the start of his 16th season at @entity170			1
@entity152 has had a stellar career , playing for the same team throughout and making more than 400 @entity20 appearances			1
like @entity176 , he has also lifted the @entity177			0
still hope ? if @entity2 put aside some differences with the @entity127 , he may yet be on the plane to @entity180 @entity2 , who is the same age , has had a similar career , but can also point to three @entity20 titles in the @entity30 era			1
he also remains the last player to successfully come through the youth ranks at the club , something which should not be overlooked in the final reckoning			0
at some stage his luck will finally run out , but it wo n’t be this summer			0
on the slide ? @entity2 's career has been one marked with controversy ... and success veteran : @entity152 was rewarded with a new contract at @entity155			1

@entity2 playing better than ever this season under @entity72
if he put differences aside with @entity127 he could be on the plane to @entity180
@entity155 showed faith in veteran @entity152 ... will @entity5 do the same with centre back @entity2 ?
