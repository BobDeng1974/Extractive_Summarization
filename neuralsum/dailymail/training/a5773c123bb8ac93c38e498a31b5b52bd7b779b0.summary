a scientist at @entity1 has converted data from the sun into sounds in a process called ‘ sonification ’			1
in a video they use data from @entity1 ’s @entity11 spacecraft to ' listen ' to the solar magnetic field			1
as the solar wind changes in intensity , a shockwave can be heard passing over the spacecraft			2
a scientist at the @entity18 has carried out ' sonification '			1
this involved turning spacecraft data into audible sounds ( illustration shown )			1
this resulted in short clips that revealed shock waves passing over the satellite			1
the data was gathered by @entity1 's @entity11 satellite in 2007 @entity30 , a phd candidate in design science at the @entity18 , performed the process			1
he is also a sonification specialist who trains heliophysicists at @entity1 ’s @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38			1
‘ @entity39 offers a promising supplement to standard visual analysis techniques , ’ he said			0
the @entity11 satellite , which is in orbit around the sun , records electromagnetic fluctuations that can be converted directly to audio samples			1
@entity30 and his team used custom written computer algorithms to convert those electromagnetic frequencies into sounds			2
the result is that when a fast stream of plasma - super hot , charged gas that fills space - passes the spacecraft , it creates a noticeable effect			2
converting data from the @entity11 spacecraft into audio reveals an audible shock wave			1
the @entity11 satellite ( right ) , which launched in 1994 and is still active today , is used to study radio and plasma that occur in the solar wind from the sun ( left ) before it reaches @entity66			1
the @entity11 spacecraft has enough fuel to last in solar orbit for 60 years , during which time it could continue to gather useful data in one example , @entity30 's team analysed data points from the @entity11 satellite from november 2007 , condensing three hours of real - time recording to a three second audio clip			1
while this ' sonification ' process related to an event in 2007 , a powerful solar flare blasting its way towards @entity66 could wreak havoc with communications and power systems in the coming days			2
scientists have warned that the ' extreme ' solar storm could affect power grids , satellites and radio transmissions when the flare arrives at the @entity66 's surface			0
but they said they are not ' scared of this one ' , as the worst of its power looks like it will miss the planet and not cause many problems			0
it should , however , lead to stunning auroras extending out from @entity66 's poles			0
to an untrained ear , the data sounds like a microphone recording on a windy day			2
when @entity30 presented these sounds to a researcher , however , they could identify a distinct chirping at the beginning of the audio clip followed by a percussive event , culminating in a loud boom			0
@entity30 translates the data into audio files through a process known as audification , a specific type of sonification that involves directly listening to raw , unedited satellite data			1
translating this data into audio can be likened to part of the process of collecting sound from a person singing into a microphone at a recording studio with reel - to - reel tape			0
when a person sings into a microphone , it detects changes in pressure and converts the pressure signals to changes in magnetic intensity in the form of an electrical signal			0
the clips have three distinct sections , including a warble noise leading up to a short knock at slightly higher frequency followed by a quieter segment containing broadband noise that is both rising and hissing			2
the sound of a shock passing over the spacecraft can also be heard the electrical signals are stored on the reel tape			1
@entity148 on the @entity150 satellite measure changes in magnetic field directly creating a similar kind of electrical signal			0
@entity30 writes a computer program to translate this data to an audio file			0
' the tones come out of the data naturally , ' he said			0
' if there is a frequency embedded in the data , then that frequency becomes audible as a sound			2
' listening to data in this way has been done before			0
in a study in 1982 , researchers used audification to identify micrometeroids , or small ring particles , hitting the @entity172 spacecraft as it traversed @entity174 's rings			1
the impacts were visually obscured in the data but could be easily heard - sounding like intense impulses , almost like a hailstorm			0
however , the method is not often used in the science community because it requires a certain level of familiarity with the sounds			0
for instance , the listener needs to have an understanding of what typical solar wind turbulence sounds like in order to identify atypical events			0
' it 's about using your ear to pick out subtle differences , ' @entity30 said .			0

a scientist at the @entity18 has carried out ' sonification '
this involved turning spacecraft data into audible sounds
results in short clips that reveal shock waves passing over a satellite
@entity208 was gathered by @entity1 's @entity11 satellite in 2007
same technique was once used to listen to rocks hitting @entity172
