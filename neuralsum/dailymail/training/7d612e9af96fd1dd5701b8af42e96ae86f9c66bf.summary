@entity1 chief sir @entity0 said that faint - hearted heads are failing to impose their authority on schools , resulting in low standards of education and poor discipline faint - hearted heads are failing to impose their authority on schools , resulting in low standards of education and poor discipline among pupils , according to the chief inspector of schools			1
sir @entity0 said school leaders are too worried about offending their teaching staff , many of whom have a ‘ pervasive resentment of all things managerial ’ , and refuse to accept their place lower down the hierarchy			1
in a hard - hitting speech in central @entity24 yesterday , the head of @entity1 said teachers were also failing to make it clear to children that adults are in charge			1
he said there was nothing wrong with telling children ‘ do as i ask , because i am the adult ’			2
but he suggested the problem stemmed from weak heads who lack the will and experience to lead from the top			2
sir @entity0 said : ‘ too many teachers still think that school leaders do not have the right to tell them how to teach or what to do			1
‘ the staff room , in their minds , is just as capable of deciding the direction a school should take as the @entity47			2
‘ i ’ve come to the conclusion that many of their efforts are undermined by a pervasive resentment of all things managerial			0
‘ some teachers simply will not accept that a school is n’t a collective but an organisation with clear hierarchies and separate duties			2
‘ what ’s worse , far too many school leaders seem to believe that they do n’t have a right to manage either			1
they worry constantly about staff reaction			2
they hold endless meetings to curry favour			0
they seem to think they can not act without their employees ’ approval			0
‘ yes , you should consult with staff			2
but never confuse consultation with negotiation			0
’ sir @entity0 also said teachers were also failing to make it clear to children that adults are in charge ( file picture ) children can not ‘ thrive in a chaotic school where there is little authority ’ , sir @entity0 said , adding : ‘ indeed , children who come from homes where there are few boundaries need more structure at school , not less			1
‘ @entity87 attainment is predicated on a culture in which heads do everything they can to reinforce not only their authority but the authority of all the staff in the school			1
‘ if youngsters feel that they are in a more powerful position than the teacher , the teaching assistant or the dinner lady , that they can defy authority and do so with impunity , no amount of theorising about raising attainment will make much difference			0
‘ there is absolutely nothing wrong in my view in saying to youngsters “ do as i ask , because i am the adult , i am older than you , i know more than you and , by the way , i am in authority over you ”			0
’ in 2011 , education secretary @entity113 announced new measures to give disruptive pupils an ‘ unambiguous lesson in who ’s boss ’ , including loosening rules on the use of physical force by teachers , the right to search children for items , such as mobile phones , and increased financial penalties for parents who allow their children to play truant			0
but sir @entity0 ’s comments suggest school staff still do not have the confidence to exert their authority after years of seeing their powers eroded			1
in 2011 education secretary @entity113 , left , announced new measures to give disruptive pupils an ' unambiguous lesson in who 's boss ' , while schools minister @entity137 , right , yesterday announced £ 10m would be spent on doubling the number of specially trained teachers in challenging schools he also warned too many headteachers lack vision for their school beyond a ‘ natty slogan ’ , and do n’t pay attention to detail			1
‘ it ’s pointless concocting grand plans if the school playground is a mess , uniforms are slovenly , staff are too casual , children pay more attention to their mobile phones than to the teachers and the school reception has all the charm of the check - in desk at @entity160 , ’ he said			1
‘ the best leaders get the details right because they know that these underpin the big issues of student achievement and progress			0
’ @entity166 , of the @entity167 , said teachers needed extra training to help them understand their greater powers of discipline			0
he said : ‘ the government should make the guidelines even clearer			0
