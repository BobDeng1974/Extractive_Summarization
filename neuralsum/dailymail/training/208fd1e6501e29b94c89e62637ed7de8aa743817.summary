after more than a week of silence from the bottom of the @entity4 , @entity1 's prime minister has conceded that the best leads will soon be exhausted - and the search for @entity7 will have to stop			1
@entity8 said that when all leads had been exhausted in about a week ' we stop , we regroup , we reconsider			2
' the chances of finding the wreckage of the @entity16 in an area 1500 miles north west of @entity18 depend on the underwater drone @entity11 - 21 , which was today being prepared for its third launch after two earlier search operations deep in the @entity4 found nothing of any significance			2
he remained confident , however , that the search was being conducted in the right area , based on electronic signals , possibly from the @entity48 ' plane 's black boxes - messages from the deep picked up by a ' ping ' detecting device being towed behind the @entity1 ship @entity34 , but while mr @entity8 held out what appeared to be diminishing hope , the use of @entity54 has been criticised by the man who has been at the forefront of the search for the wreckage of the plane flown by aviation pioneer @entity62 in 1937			1
mr @entity64 , founder of the @entity65 , said that on one of his many trips to the @entity68 searching for the wreckage of the @entity62 plane he had employed the use of @entity11 - 21 - and found it lacking			0
' i can tell you , it did n't work for us , ' he told @entity77			2
' we were very hopeful the @entity54 would be the answer , the way to search for the very hard to find wreckage			0
' what we found was that the @entity54 could n't perform reliably , ' we had extremely frustrating aborted missions , just as we have seen in the @entity4			0
' during this week 's searches , @entity11 has had to be brought back to the surface early in each of its first two dives			1
on the first occasion its safety programme kicked in when it reached a depth of about 3,000 miles and it came back to the surface			1
when it was deployed a second time , it had to be brought back up to repair ' technical issues ' before it was put back into the water			1
on each of the two dives it has found nothing that gives searchers any hope of locating the plane 's wreckage			0
the introduction of the @entity11 marks a methodical , slower paced new phase of the search , now in its 40th day and described by the search coordinator , retired air chief marshal @entity108 , as the most expensive in aviation history a @entity111 air force @entity110 takes off from @entity112 in @entity113 , on wednesday to assist with the international search effort for missing @entity7 the drone was forced to end its first deployment early on monday after it exceeded its 4.5 km ( 14,750 feet ) depth limit in the remote stretch of ocean where search authorities believe the jetliner crashed after its disappearance on march 8 with 239 people on board			0

@entity132 @entity131 personnel have said the drone could take up to two months to scour a 600 sq km area where the plane is believed to have sunk			0
