faced with the explosive talent of @entity2 and his wall of @entity5 support , @entity0 was so calm and clinical			1
whatever was thrown at him he soaked it up , like a seasoned football team executing its plan away from home and carving out the result , in this case a 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 3 quarter - final win over the local hero			1
having slain the @entity5 teenager to make his fifth semi-final at @entity17 , @entity0 was gracious in his on - court interview , impressing the crowd with warm words about @entity22 ’s future			1
@entity0 celebrates after taking the second set tie - break en route to victory against @entity2 @entity2 covers himself as @entity0 strikes down on him at the net during a dominant display in @entity17 @entity0 looks to the sky and points his fingers upwards after reaching the @entity31 semi-finals the no 6 seed performs a typical fist pumping celebration after winning a decisive point in the match it was only later , when facing questions about his next opponent @entity38 and his new coach @entity40 — @entity0 ’s long - time friend and former chief lieutenant — that he became slightly prickly			1
@entity44 ’s presence on the @entity46 ’s team , just two months after he finished five years with the 27 - year - old @entity48 ’s team , provides a fascinating subtext to thursday ’s match			1
privileged inside information will be traded			0
but @entity0 is trying not to see it that way and disingenuously claimed that in other sports people do not talk about opposition coaches and managers			2
‘ my goal is n’t to beat @entity40 , my goal is to beat @entity38 , so i do n’t think about that , ’ he said			1
‘ we ’ll see how the match plays out and what the tactics are			0
but i also know what @entity40 thinks of @entity38 ’s game because he ’s told me , so it works both ways			1
i ’m happy to talk about @entity38 and what his strengths and weaknesses are , but i do n’t want to discuss what @entity40 does well and does n’t do well , because i ’m not playing him			1
’ thereafter he reeled off the world no 7 ’s attributes , such as his height , strength and flat ballstriking ability , and how he must be playing well			0
that is true , for the newly - engaged @entity38 has made it through without dropping a set and dismissed @entity79 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 , 7 - 6 , although the @entity80 — short of matches and possibly injured — was woefully out of touch in the first two sets			2
@entity38 is @entity0 's next opponent after he saw off @entity79 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 , 7 - 6 @entity38 celebrates as he makes the next stage where he will face @entity86 at the @entity31 @entity38 's coach @entity40 is @entity0 ’s long - time friend and former chief lieutenant @entity44 ( right ) will be in @entity38 's corner for his @entity31 clash with @entity0 @entity0 showed admirable fortitude against the youthful zest of @entity22 but , whatever the circumstances , will feel more vulnerable against @entity38			1
the 29 - year - old holds a 4 - 2 career record against him , and there have been matches in which he has found his easy power difficult to handle			0
now there is the emotional dimension of having his one - time ally plotting against him , the @entity103 boy who befriended him as an adolescent at their tennis academy in @entity107 and who knows him , warts and all			1
in his exclusive interview with @entity112 last week , @entity40 went out of his way to stay classy , declaring that he would ‘ always be in @entity0 ’s corner , except if i am coaching against him ’			1
he also endorsed the hiring of @entity118 as head coach last summer , even though he was hurt at not being kept informed about the hiring			0
the one thing he has taken exception to is @entity0 ’s suggestion that not everyone in the team was pulling in the same direction towards the end of last year			2
@entity0 waves as he enters the @entity129 , where most of the 15,000 crowd were supporting @entity22 the former @entity132 champion stretches for a return during his 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 3 defeat of the @entity5 @entity135 no 1 @entity0 celebrates a first break of serve as he wins the opening set 6 - 3 @entity118 is @entity0 's new coach and will be in his corner for the @entity31 match what you know is that the gloves will be off as he sits at opposite ends of the stadium to his former colleagues on thursday ( at about 8.30am in the @entity135 ) , and @entity0 will need to show the same resolve as he did against @entity2			1
it could be argued that , for all its breathtaking skill and athleticism , the rivalries in the men ’s game can be a little too cordial at times			0
the untamed demeanour of the 19 - year - old @entity5 has been a welcome blast of refreshment here			0
he had no option but to come out blasting against @entity0 and try to feed off the crowd , though they are fundamentally well - disposed towards @entity0 here			2
instead he found his game brilliantly neutered by the master tactician on an evening when at least the chill temperatures will have made the @entity48 feel at home			0
@entity0 slowed down his opponent ’s quick tempo between points , and prevented him from teeing off with a subtle mix of pace , angles and slices , including some feathered drop - shots			1
not only that but the @entity48 ’s serve was outstanding , and his 13 aces outscored by four the man who came into the match having hit the most in the tournament			0
@entity179 celebrates wildly as @entity0 takes control of the match in blustery conditions in @entity17 @entity0 's girlfriend @entity183 takes her seat for one of the more comfortable afternoons of watching her boyfriend @entity189 will also be backing her son when he faces @entity38 in @entity17 to add to his deflation , at 2 - 5 @entity2 was given an audible obscenity violation , having cursed his way through his previous match without punishment			1
there was inconsistency in that , and the way he escaped censure when smashing his racket in the tiebreak			0
memorably , @entity0 had played an exquisite running lob to stop his momentum in that , and then he performed another on set point to clinch it 7 - 5			2
it was a glorious example of touch and technique , and clarity of thought , under enormous pressure			0
@entity22 , whose brief charge in the third set was undone by some extraordinary flicks from @entity0 off the baseline , will come again			2
asked where he would like to be when he returns here next year he responded drily : ‘ @entity17			0
’ @entity79 , who denied he was injured , needs more matches , and he will get them next month when he heads to clay - court events in @entity222			2
but his defeat will still have served as a boost to the sometimes brittle @entity38 , who had lost to him 17 consecutive times			0
for all sorts of reasons @entity0 will have masses of motivation when they meet , and so will he			0
the double @entity232 winner signs autographs for fans as he leaves after another impressive performance			0

@entity0 beat @entity2 to reach the @entity31 semi-final
@entity0 's next opponent is @entity38 and his coach @entity40
@entity44 is @entity0 's long - time friend and former chief lieutenant
‘ my goal is n’t to beat @entity40 , my goal is to beat @entity38 , so i do n’t think about that , ’ @entity0 said after his quarter - final win
