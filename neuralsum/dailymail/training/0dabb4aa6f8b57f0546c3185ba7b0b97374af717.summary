by @entity0 published : 06:59 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 09:50 est , 4 september 2012 a four - year - old girl who suffered a massive stroke in the womb has stunned doctors by using the healthy side of her brain to walk and talk			1
parents @entity9 and @entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , were left devastated when a scan revealed their newborn daughter @entity14 had suffered a stroke ten days earlier			1
they were told that the stroke had caused catastrophic damage to her brain she would never walk or speak			1
but although it has taken @entity14 longer than normal to reach certain milestones she is all set to go to start her first day at school with her peers			1
@entity9 ( left ) was devastated when she was told her daughter @entity14 had suffered brain damage due to a stroke in the womb			1
but the plucky youngster , now four , has made amazing progress ( right ) @entity9 , 39 , said : ' after she was born we were told that , if she did survive , not to expect her to ever walk , talk or communicate			1
' now , she ’ll be able to run through those schools gates			0
thinking about everything she has overcome fills me with pride			0
' professor @entity37 , consultant obstetrician for the baby charity @entity38 said : ' a stroke in the womb is basically a brain injury that results in disability and is caused by bleeding or a lack of oxygen			1
' around three in 1,000 babies will have some form of brain damage leading to stillbirth while a further one of two per 1,000 will have brain damage but survive			1
' a baby has more potential to recover from a stroke than an adult as they are better able to adapt to using other parts of their brain			2
' that said surviving such a major brain injury before birth is unusual , and it 's remarkable @entity14 is recovering so well			1
' as soon as @entity14 was born , @entity9 and @entity10 , 35 , they say they knew there was a problem with their daughter and and when she was just a day old , their worst fears were confirmed			2
an ultrasound at @entity71 revealed she had suffered a massive brain injury in the womb			2
mrs @entity74 said : ' when @entity14 was born i expected to hear crying but there was none of that			2
' she was rushed off by the nurses and i did n’t see her till she was 12 hours old and she was on a ventilator			0
' we did n’t know what to expect or what was going to happen			0
' then she was taken to the @entity84 , where they told us she had the stoke ten days earlier - when she was still in the womb			0
' when the doctor told us i could n’t believe it , i though a stroke was something that only happened to older people			0
' she had all these wires coming out of her and stuck to her head and she ’d also shown some signs of seizures			0
' @entity14 is treated using a bright blue fluorescent light to treat jaundice @entity9 and @entity10 with @entity14 : she 's one - in - a - million @entity9 said of her daughter @entity14 remained in hospital for five and a half weeks and when she returned home , her parents were faced with the prospect of buying a wheelchair and looking into full - time care for their daughter			1
medics warned the couple , who also have three older children , @entity110 , 20 , @entity111 , 11 and @entity112 , 10 , that their little girl would never reach the usual milestones			0
but they were left stunned as @entity14 used the other side of her brain to learn to walk and talk			1
ready to start : @entity14 is going to a mainstream school in @entity11 mrs @entity74 said : ' she was seven months old when she sat up on her own for the first time			1
' up until then she had never given an indication of hope - she had never babbled like other babies or shown an interest in toys			1
' we were crying and telling everyone about it			0
it might be something most people take for granted but for us it was so special			0
' at ten months old , she learnt to walk and said her first word at two - years - old			1
@entity14 , who still suffers from anxiety , is due to start at @entity133 in @entity11 today			2
it will be a proud day for her parents who only found out she would enter mainstream school in may			0
mrs @entity74 said : ' when we got the news , we were were made up			0
it was a massive weight off our shoulders			0
' we ’ve been told it ’s so rare for a child to come on so far after everything she ’s been through			0
she ’s one - in - a - million			0
' @entity147 , founder of the @entity149 support group , has helped @entity14 and her family over the past few years and watched @entity14 ’s amazing recovery			2
she said : ' @entity14 ’s story and family are amazing , and her recovery is so encouraging			2
having to learn to accept that your baby or child has now got an acquired brain injury is so traumatic and so very isolating , and @entity14 and her family have been very brave			1
' @entity149 effect babies in different ways and some babies do n’t get recognised till some time down the line - even months - when the baby does n’t seem to be developing as normal			1
' there are no exact figures for the number of childhood strokes as there is no registry			0
' a stroke is for life and the hurdles children face are huge			0
stroke is an invisable condition sometimes as it ’s the brain injury people ca n’t see			2
' for mums and dads it so hard to explain the behaviour and problems that are hidden within our children			0
' @entity10 with newborn @entity14 : she has astonished doctors with her progress for more information about the @entity149 support group visit their website at @entity189			1

doctors did not expect @entity14 to be able to walk or talk after she suffered a stroke before her birth
at seven months she sat up for the first time - giving her parents hope
one of two babies per thousand have brain injuries before birth and survive
