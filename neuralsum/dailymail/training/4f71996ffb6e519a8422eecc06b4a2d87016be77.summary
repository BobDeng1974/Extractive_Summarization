by @entity0 a @entity2 teenager is recovering from second - degree burns after he set himself alight after copying a dangerous new trend online dubbed the ' @entity5 '			1
the 15 - year - old , who declined to be identified for @entity7 , poured rubbing alcohol over his chest and filmed himself on friday			1
videos of people doing the same have started appearing online and the teen admitted he was not thinking of the consequences when he decided to imitate them			1
suitably chastened : the @entity2 teenager , 15 , is pictured here with bandages after his lucky escape after setting himself on fire to satisfy his need to copy the ' @entity5 ' game that is sweeping the internet ' i just poured alcohol on it , and lit it , and it just automatically went and burst , ' said the teen to @entity7			1
' @entity28 , yea , basically , ' the teen said about the pain , according to @entity30			2
' literally after it got put out it was already blistering , it â€™s just hard			0
' firefighters arrived at the home of the boy 's aunt and took to hospital for treatment to severe burns on his chest and abdomen			1
the lucky teenager said that he had no idea of the likely effects because in the videos he had seen , the person who did the ' fire challenge ' never kept the camera running long enough afterwards			2
response : @entity51 , @entity2 firefighters rushed to help the boy who set himself on fire at his aunt 's house firefighters in @entity51 said they hope others listen and do n't try to copy the teenager			1
' what they do n't show at the end of the videos is the consequences of doing this , getting second and third degree burns , ' @entity60 captain @entity59 said to @entity7			1
the ' @entity5 ' is the latest internet phenomenon in the same vein as the the gallon milk and cinnamon challenge			2
however , while those are relatively safe , this is far more serious			0
crazy : the ' @entity5 ' has seen many upload videos of themselves setting fire to their arms , legs , chest and even genitals dangerous : some undertake the challenge in a shower so that they can douse themselves with water immediately videos online reveal a number of young men either using an aerosol canister or alcohol as an accelerant and then light their chest , legs , arms or even genital areas			1
most scream and shout as the flames ignite and thrash wildly to put the fire out while friends who are filming laugh out loud			2
others undertake the challenge in a shower , with close access to water should they need it			0
covered in bandages now , the chastened @entity2 teen told @entity7 that he has been left feeling slightly foolish			1
' just watching it and never seeing what ended and just being childish , ' said the 15 - year - old			2
' i do n't know , i was n't thinking really			1
' the teen admitted to @entity7			2
the @entity113 the idea of the cinnamon challenge is take put a tablespoon of powdered cinnamon into your mouth and try to swallow it			0
admittedly humorous videos uploaded online show people trying and failing to complete this challenge			0
however , doctors have warned not to try it because of the danger of choking due to the drying effect of the powdered spice.the gallon of milk in an hour challenge made popular by television show @entity134 , the point of this is to drink a gallon of the white stuff in an hour and then not vomit			0
while obviously disgusting , the seemingly innocent nature of milk had many trying and failing to complete the challenge			0
while doctors warn that drinking one gallon of anything , including water in a hour is dangerous , most fail the milk challenge because it curdles in the stomach and the body simply needs to expel it			0
@entity147 this particular online challenge is prevalent in the @entity149 and began as a drinking game between two people			0
the challenge would be to drink a particularly strong alcoholic drink in one go and then ask another person to accept or deny the gauntlet			0
however , it expanded to include dangerous dares to be done after drinking and at least five deaths in @entity149 have been reported in @entity149 as a result of this .			0

@entity2 teen , who declined to be identified set himself on fire copying latest new online trend
suffered second - degree burns to his chest and abdomen and admitted ' i do n't know what i was thinking '
