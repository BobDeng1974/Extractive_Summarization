if there 's one man in football who knows how to deal with noisy neighbours , it 's @entity6 legend sir @entity5			1
the 13 - time @entity8 champion had to put up with @entity9 's millions for the last five years of his reign			0
now former @entity12 striker @entity11 has a similar task as manager of the @entity15 , who compete for affection locally with the @entity21 champions ' sister club @entity18			1
@entity5 met up with @entity11 and the club 's star striker @entity22 for breakfast on friday in @entity25 , and perhaps offered advice on how @entity15 could deal with their wealthier neighbours			1
@entity15 striker @entity22 ( left ) , sir @entity5 ( centre ) and @entity15 manager @entity11 ( right ) the former @entity30 man at his unveiling with @entity32 , who played for the old @entity15 side @entity34 legend @entity22 poses for photos with supporters after joining the @entity38 club born : june 27 1977 ( age 37 ) 1994 - 2010 : @entity30 ( 741 apps , 323 gls ) 2010 - 2012 : @entity41 ( 66 , 28 ) 2012 - 2014 : @entity42 ( 39 , 11 ) 1996 - 2006 : @entity43 ( 102 , 44 ) @entity11 has a considerable experience playing in the @entity45 , but had never managed a side before taking charge of the @entity15 in 2013			1
ironically , @entity22 's first game will be against the @entity49 , now part owned by the @entity51 's former @entity30 strike - partner @entity50			2
cosmos enjoyed arguably their greatest spell with another @entity55 legend @entity32 in the late 1970s , and although @entity22 admitted the team wanted to entertain the crowd like their predecessors , he was more intent on creating a new golden era than trying to emulate former glory			0
speaking to @entity62 about his recent move , @entity22 said : ' we shall aim to be an entertaining team , which plays football well			0
we want to catch people 's attention , to win over the crowds			0
' the club 's history will always be there , but now the club is starting a new chapter			0
' @entity22 's former @entity30 strike partner @entity50 bought a stake in @entity38 side the @entity49 former @entity30 team - mates @entity22 and @entity50 celebrate winning @entity34 in 2003 @entity78 will join local rivals @entity18 at the end of the @entity8 season			2
