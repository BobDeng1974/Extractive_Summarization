a new exhibition has opened in @entity1 which showcases the art of fake high fashion items and counterfeit designer products			1
faking it : originals , copies , and @entity8 , which is on view at the museum at the @entity11 until april 25 , 2015 , also highlights the incredible popularity of certain counterfeit items , such as the much sought - after ' @entity15 ' designs , which were inspired by high - end brand @entity16			1
and it 's not just modern - day trends that are featured in the exhibit			1
according to the show 's curator , @entity21 , the trend for producing fake fashion spans many a decade - dating back to the early and mid 20th century			1
from high - end to @entity15 : the exhibition showcases some counterfeit labels that have proved to be almost as popular as the original brands they were inspired by seeing double : it 's hard to tell which is the authentic design and which is the fake			1
in this case , the suit on the left was a licensed copy of the @entity38 original on the right it 's all about the label : the easiest way to tell these two designs apart is by spotting which one has a label , and which one does n't ' the oldest piece we have in our show is a pair of shoes from the 18th century with paste stone buckles that imitate diamonds , ' she told i - @entity56			1
' but , copying mostly started with the advent of the couture system and designer labels			0
[ early and mid 20th century ] couturiers created " licensed copies " , which were line - for - line copies with the same materials and technique , except without labels			2
' ms @entity21 also explained that brands have been trying to eliminate copies of their products for decades and added that both @entity69 and @entity70 banned all press from their 1956 collections because they thought it would help to cut down on the number of knock - off fakes being created			1
' it did n't completely work , ' she said			0
' buyers might buy one garment , but they 'd see the whole collection			0
photography and sketches were n't allowed in shows , so they had special copyists and sketchers who would remember			0
' but while some people might view fake fashion items as being obviously cheap reproductions , when it came to differentiating between what exhibition pieces were real and which were fake , ms @entity21 admitted it was n't always that easy			2
' with some of the accessories it 's very difficult to tell whether they 're authentic , ' she explained			2
a red sole is a red sole : often , customers do n't mind whether the product is real or fake , provided it has the same look and feel to it , such as these knock - off @entity103 all the trimmings : the distinctively red - soled shoes even came with their own fake card of authenticity the origins of fashion : some of the pieces included in the collection , such as these vintage dresses , help visitors to understand more about the history of clothing design ' often , it 's only on the inside where it shows			1
there will be shoddy construction or the leather will be buckling , even if the outside is perfect			0
' the exhibition does n't just include exact copies of high - end designs ; there are a number of pieces on display which use particularly distinctive brand logos , such as those used by @entity133 and @entity134 , in completely unique designs , for example an original dress created by an independent designer which is then emblazoned with the iconic @entity133 pattern			2
interestingly , quite a few of the designers whose fake fashions are on display faced no legal action from the brands that they copied , despite their similarities being so blatant - and some designers went as far as to see the counterfeits as something of a compliment			0
' @entity38 , for one , was into people knocking off her things , ' ms @entity21 added			0
' i think she understood the fashion system and that there is n't any bad press			0

the show at the @entity1 's @entity161 examines the history of popular knock - offs
faking it : originals , copies , and @entity8 also *investigates* the origin of fashion
