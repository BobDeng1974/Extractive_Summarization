they share the bond of a grandfather and granddaughter , but in the 18 years they have known each other , have never actually met			0
when she was 11 - years - old , @entity7 girl @entity6 - who asked that her surname not be published - was given a school assignment to write to a pen pal , with an ad placed in different newspapers calling for people in other states interested in corresponding with the students			1
@entity16 , a writer from @entity17 , @entity18 , came across the ad and responded , subsequently beginning an exchange that would - and continues to - last a lifetime			1
that was 1996 , and @entity16 - then 61 - and his wife , @entity23 , started to eagerly await letters from their young pen pal , @entity6 , @entity21 reported			1
finally : @entity6 and @entity16 have been writing to each other for the last 18 years , but have only just met each other in the flesh in @entity29 , @entity18 first meal : the two decided to meet for dinner and share their first meal together			1
both were in tears both would send photos in their letters and celebrate birthdays and holidays with each other from afar			0
one year @entity16 playfully told @entity6 he wanted either a @entity42 or @entity43 for his birthday			1
@entity6 then sent a toy car of each make			2
the couple witnessed @entity6 grow up through her letters , and @entity16 has kept all of them , even a poem @entity6 wrote for him when she was young			2
however , much to his dismay , @entity16 , now almost 80 , was forced to stop writing back to @entity6 recently , as his @entity53 worsens and his hands are too shaky to put pen to paper			1
unwilling to be cut off from her surrogate grandparents , @entity6 traveled the 1,600 miles from @entity7 to @entity17 , to finally meet them			1
a reunion of sorts : @entity16 and his wife @entity23 ( together ) finally got to meet @entity6 ( center left ) and her family , after @entity6 traveled from @entity7 to meet with the couple @entity16 sat anxiously in the restaurant where they planned to meet			1
' i 'm so excited			0
i 'm nervous , ' he told @entity21			0
then @entity6 , now a 29 - year - old woman , finally arrived			2
she ran in with tears streaming down her face and her arms outstretched			0
' we made it , ' she said			0
' how are you ? can you believe it ? ' @entity16 was crying just as much			2
' i 've never had anybody go to this much trouble to see me before , ' he said			0
celebration : together with their families , @entity6 and @entity16 ( back left ) have now finally met once the tears stopped , the two shared their first proper conversation and meal			1
they have now agreed to speak over text , with @entity23 helping her husband type and read the messages			0
@entity6 acknowledged that , with technology the way it is now , other children wo n't get to have an experience like she did			0
' the connections you make are way more important than anything you 're going to learn in a book , ' she said .			0
