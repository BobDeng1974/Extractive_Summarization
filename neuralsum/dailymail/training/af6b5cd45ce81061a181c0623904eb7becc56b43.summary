by @entity1 reporter published : 22:06 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 07:46 est , 30 july 2013 after a prank pulled by @entity5 got a homeless man kicked out of his longtime home in a @entity9 water tank , the secretive @entity3 street artist made amends by giving the man enough money to live for a full year			1
the trouble began after @entity5 turned @entity16 ’s makeshift @entity15 home into a piece of art by spray painting along the side of the bus - sized tank ‘ this looks a bit like an elephant ’ and it only got worse when collectors who covet the elusive artist ’s work bought @entity16 ’s squat to sell to collectors			1
though @entity5 painted the joke on the homeless man ’s home with its occupant ’s approval , it left him without a roof over his head			1
now , it has been revealed just how swiftly @entity5 made amends with @entity16 and the high regard in which he now holds the controversial artist			1
‘ he was an angel to me			0
he helped me more than anybody helped me in my life			0
’ @entity16 , 54 , has lived an eccentric life			1
he once made money by wearing a suit of armor and rollerblading around @entity61 to entertain tourists			0
he ’s also , at various times , worked as a @entity64 , choreographer , @entity67 dancer , and male escort			0
‘ most of my life i ’ve been a performer , ’ @entity16 said			2
‘ i never had a real job			0
’ @entity16 has lived without what most people call a home for many years , since after what he calls a string of bad relationships			1
tank man : @entity16 sits in his extraordinary tank home , which in its prime featured an electricity generator , television , an address and even mail service homeless again : @entity16 made the abandoned bus - sized water tank his home with electricity and even mail service and a television ( pictured ) on his throne : @entity16 spent seven years working on his tank before @entity5 's influence , and his art world adulation , pulled the red carpet out from under @entity16 while living on a hillside above a stretch of @entity15 between @entity96 and @entity97 , @entity16 noticed a water tank being abandoned			1
it was initially park of a failed effort to build a park			0
‘ i watched it for a month or so , ’ @entity16 said			2
‘ eventually , i climbed inside and saw that it was empty			0
i thought , “ wow			0
this would be a cool place to make a house			0
” ’ so for years , that ’s what he called the metal tank			2
he refinished the inside with discarded building materials found in the surrounding affluent beachside neighborhoods and became a staple in the area			0
homeless again : @entity16 perches atop his tank just before it was removed in 2011			1
after @entity5 spray painted his joke on the tank , an art collector purchased it and hauled it away , leaving @entity122 homeless again police left him alone despite neighbor complaints			1
in its heyday , @entity16 ’s tank had a generator , television , security camera , and its own address complete with mail service			1
then , one day in 2011 , he heard some people outside			0
‘ i looked out of the hatch , and there were two guys there , ’ he said			0
the guys said they were making a joke as they spray - painted the vaguely elephant - shaped tank			2
@entity16 did n’t stop them , he thought it was funny , too			2
eccentric : @entity16 says he has always been a performer and at various times has worked as a @entity64 impersonator , a male escort , and armor - clad rollerblader ‘ this looks a bit like an elephant , ’ the tank now read			1
one of the men introduced himself as @entity5			2
‘ i did n’t know who he was , so i did n’t think twice about it , ’ said the oblivious @entity16			2
unfortunately , other people were n’t quite as out of the loop and news quickly spread about the secretive graffiti artist ’s @entity9 cameo piece			0
soon after , an @entity9 - based art organization bought the tank and not long after that , they hauled it away			0
like an elephant : a regretful @entity5 gave @entity16 enough money to live for a year			1
he says he 'll never forget what the artist did for him			0
' there ain ¿ t no better man than @entity5 ' but before @entity16 had a single day to despair , @entity5 righted his wrong			1
' he helped me so fast ' : @entity16 says he 'd never been treated as nicely by anyone before @entity5			1
' it was like a miracle ' back on his feet : though the money from @entity5 has run out and @entity16 is back living on the hill sans tank , he 's now on a waiting list for government - funded housing ‘ he helped me so fast , i did n’t have to spend a single day more on the streets , ’ @entity16 told the @entity50			1
‘ it was like a miracle			0
’ @entity5 gave him money to get settled in an apartment and pay bills for a year			0
though that money has now run out , @entity16 continues to think highly of the artist and has even decided to revisit his glory days as @entity191 , the skating armored man			1
since his eviction , @entity16 has also become the subject of a what some some @entity196 - based filmmakers hope will become a documentary on his unwitting role in the world of high art called something from nothing			2
and this week , a play based on @entity122 and his elephant tank called @entity5 : the room in the @entity207 begins a run at the @entity3 's @entity209 this wednesday .			2

@entity16 lived in an water tank for seven years before @entity5 used it as a joke and caught the attention of covetous art collectors
@entity16 soon found himself without a home again , but the elusive artist quickly *stepped* in to right his wrong
