@entity7 and filmmaker husband @entity8 , from @entity9 , were expecting their first child after 10 years together			2
it should have been the happiest time of their lives			0
' we were really excited			0
our baby was planned , we were delighted and our families were over the moon for us , ' says @entity7 , an entrepreneur and conference organiser for the economist , now 32			1
@entity7 and filmmaker husband @entity8 , from @entity9 , were expecting their first child after 10 years together ' we busied ourselves with work , by that time we worked for ourselves from home , planning out the nursery and thinking of names			1
' just before i fell pregnant , i 'd been to the doctor as i 'd been feeling really quite breathless and was worried that i could never seem to quite catch my breath , but the doctor told me it was anxiety and not to worry			1
' all @entity7 's scans progressed normally and the first half of her pregnancy went without any major problems			2
but one day , when she was in her 21st week of pregnancy , @entity7 suddenly fainted at home			1
concerned , she saw her gp who ran a series of tests			0
nothing came up as abnormal and she was told to go home and rest			2
at 29 weeks @entity7 passed out six times and had a fit			1
she went to hospital but was told to go home by 24 weeks @entity7 was extremely breathless			1
' i could n't make it up the stairs without having to sit down half way to try and catch my breath , ' she says			0
' i could n't even make it to the toilet in the night without gasping for air			0
it was really quite scary , but everyone reassured me it was simply the growing baby taking up space and pressing under my ribcage that was making me lose my breath			2
' i 'm asthmatic anyway so thought that it could have been that having an effect too			0
' i saw other mothers in the second trimester looking and feeling great , with bags of energy - not me			0
i spent more and more time resting			0
i could n't walk our dog			0
it was all i could do to make it out of bed			0
' at 29 weeks @entity7 took a turn for the worse			1
over the course of a weekend she passed out six times			0
and at 5am one sunday morning she started fitting after trying to make it from the bathroom back to bed			2
@entity8 , woken by the noise , rang for an ambulance immediately			0
paramedics quickly arrived , checked @entity7 over and took her to the local hospital where she was declared well enough to go home and rest			1
the following day while in bed , @entity7 passed out again , vomited and suffered diarrhoea			2
admitted to @entity88 general for a second time , her obstetrician recommended a cardiologist run an echo and ultrasound on her heart to rule out any complications			0
@entity7 was advised that the 29 - week - old baby she was carrying would in all likelihood be delivered in 48 hours the news was bleak			1
@entity7 had pulmonary arterial hypertension , a condition that hardens the arteries from the lungs to the heart			1
women suffering it are advised not to fall pregnant as their mortality rate climbs to 50 per cent			1
@entity7 was advised that the 29 - week - old baby she was carrying would in all likelihood be delivered by c - section in the next 48 hours to increase her own chances of survival			1
first , she was rushed to a specialist unit at @entity111 some 30 miles away			0
' it was scary but i do n't think i really realised the seriousness of the condition , ' says @entity7			1
' it was n't until i opened my eyes at about 2am in the morning and found my parents , siblings and husband sat round my bed , all with ashen faces , that it started to sink in just how critical my condition was			2
@entity7 responded really well to the infusion of drugs to the heart , so was able to give birth at 34 weeks ' when the care team explained that i needed to get all my affairs in place as i might not get through the delivery , it really hit home just how ill i actually was			1
' luckily i responded really well to the infusion of drugs they were pumping straight into my heart to reduce its size and give me the best chance of survival			0
i was still very breathless , but the signs were improving			0
' @entity142 was eventually delivered by c - section at 34 weeks , weighing 5lb 2oz			1
@entity142 , now 14 months old , was taken to the hospital next door , queen @entity146 's , while @entity7 was rushed back to intensive care where she spent the next 10 days			1
@entity7 takes strong medication every day and it 's likely she will require a heart and lung transplant in the future two women with the same condition had previously died on day five and seven after being diagnosed , but @entity7 pulled through that critical period and was allowed home a week later			1
' knowing @entity142 was already home and waiting for me really spurred me on to get better			1
' i had to learn to walk again and still had a cocktail of drugs being injected straight into my heart every day , but that feeling of being home is the best ever			0
@entity142 , now 14 months old , was delivered by c - section at 34 weeks , weighing 5lb 2oz ' my husband @entity8 was the only one who really knew how scared i was during that whole time			1
he was brilliant and could n't have been more positive			0
' he was talking to specialists and sufferers all over the world to ensure we were armed with all the information we needed			0
' his support and the love and care of my family , combined with wanting to meet my baby , gave me the strength i needed to get through that incredibly difficult time			2
' @entity7 takes strong medication every day and it 's likely will require a heart and lung transplant in the future			2
housebound for the first 10 months after diagnosis , she came up with the idea of @entity188 , a monthly gift box for new mums containing unique , practical and beautiful gifts for mum and baby			0
' i am hoping the business will do well so we can give something back and help further the research , ' she says			0
@entity7 's life expectancy has increased from 3 - 5 years to 10 years and more , and recently she was delighted to meet a mother who had lived with the condition for over 20 years			1
