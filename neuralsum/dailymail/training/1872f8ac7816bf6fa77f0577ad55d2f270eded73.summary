prime minister @entity0 has caused outrage among @entity2 less than a week after surviving a leadership spill - this time for sacking veteran @entity5 mp @entity4 as his chief government whip			1
mr @entity0 's move yesterday not only angered his backbench but could again risk the questioning of his leadership , the @entity7 reports			1
some even went as far as describing mr @entity0 's decision as ' scapegoating of @entity17 proportions ' amid claims the move was mr @entity4 's punishment for not seeing off the leadership challenge , the @entity13 reports			1
mr @entity4 is the longest - serving member of the @entity22 , as he first elected to for the seat of @entity24 at by - election in 1973			1
he went on to hold many titles , including the @entity27 from 1996 to 2003 during @entity29 's time in office			0
@entity32 mp @entity31 will be taking over mr @entity4 's position , which he has held since september 2013			1
' we really needed a week of healing , not wounding , and i think it really has set us back a fair bit particularly because @entity4 was such a respected character , ' mr @entity37 told the @entity13			2
one backbencher , who has not been named , described mr @entity0 's decision on friday afternoon as ' another disastrous call ' , the @entity7 reports			1
' the @entity0 had my vote on monday even though he refused to get rid of @entity51 [ the chief of staff ] , ' another mp told the @entity7			0
' he has now lost my vote because he had no right to get rid of @entity4			0
' others told the @entity55 that mr @entity0 felt mr @entity4 had not been supportive enough of the prime minister			1
mr @entity0 however denied such claims , saying his decision was based on having ' a deeper and stronger engagement with the backbench and that means it was very important to renew and refresh the whips team '			2
mr @entity0 's move to dump his chief whip on friday not only angered his backbench but also risks the questioning of his leadership once again in a statement released yesterday , mr @entity0 did not offer any reasoning behind his decision and instead thanked mr @entity4 for his contribution			1
' as @entity72 , @entity4 has given over four decades of service to the @entity74 and the @entity55 people			0
he was a senior minister throughout the life of the @entity29 government and was shadow cabinet secretary in opposition			0
later this year , he will become the second longest serving parliamentarian in our history			0
no one has done more than @entity4 helping immigrants to feel at home in their new country and helping members of migrant communities to participate in our national life , ' the prime minister said			2
' i look forward to his future contribution to the government and to our country			0
he remains an important counsellor for @entity98 members of parliament and will continue to serve as @entity100 for @entity101 with distinction			0
' these changes will be in place for the next parliamentary sitting period			0
' this comes nearly a week after mr @entity0 asked his chief whip at the time , mr @entity4 , to call a special @entity109 meeting for 9am on monday february 9 to consider the spill motion			1
the announcement was made on sunday , just after communications minister @entity112 praised mr @entity0 for holding the ballot on tuesday to give his colleagues time to discuss the matter on monday before casting their vote			2
the prime minister held onto his leadership after 61 mps voted against a spill motion and 39 for it			2
but soon after surviving the spill , mr @entity0 came under fire after he described job losses under the @entity126 government as a ' holocaust of jobs ' in parliament on thursday			1
mr @entity0 subsequently apologised and withdrew the comment			0
he replaced the word ' holocaust ' with ' decimation ' .			0
