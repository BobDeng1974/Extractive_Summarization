she nearly lost sight in one eye because of the collision police have released @entity8 images in a bid to catch off - road bikers who ran down and then left a three - year - old girl for dead in a horrifying hit - and - run			1
little @entity1 was struck and flung into the air as she crossed the road with her mother @entity16 four weeks ago			1
three off - road motorbikes were travelling on a road in @entity19 , @entity20 , when one or more of the bikes is thought to have collided with @entity1 , before driving off			1
the toddler suffered serious head and eye injuries , and came close to losing the sight in one eye			1
she was airlifted to nearby @entity2 following the shocking collision			0
thankfully , she has now been released from hospital and is recovering at home			2
@entity30 are still appealing for information to help them catch the culprits - and today released cctv images of three off - road motorbikes and four people in the hope members of the public will recognise them			1
inspector @entity38 said : ' the response from the public has been excellent			0
we have received a number of leads and have spoken to several people as part of the investigation			0
' through the amount of @entity8 we have now been able to recover and collate , we definitely know that there was more than one group of off - road motorbikes in the area at the same time as the collision and we are keen to identify the owners of the bikes and the riders			1
' @entity1 is expected to make a full recovery , however she is only a little girl and she has been through a horrendous ordeal			1
i would still urge the public to please come forward should they have any information they believe may assist the investigation			0
' cctv images of three off - road motorbikes and their four riders have been released by officers speaking shortly after the accident , which happened on the afternoon of july 3 , her devastated mother @entity16 , 20 , said : ' to think that people could do that to her and then drive off while she lies bleeding in the road makes me sick			1
' we 'd just got off the bus and were crossing the road when , out of nowhere , three motorbikes came darting round the corner			0
' i tried to grab @entity1 and screamed her name but she had just frozen from the fear of them coming towards her			1
' she was right next to me but it all happened so quickly so i did n't have time to grab her			0
she almost went under the wheel of one of the bikes but the speed they 'd hit her at meant that she bounced off and was flung a few feet down the road			0
@entity30 have today released cctv images of the riders they want to speak to ' i ran up to her and as i held her , a lad on one of the other motorcycles looked right into my eyes			1
' i begged him to stay and help me and he just drove off with the other two			0
they could see that @entity1 was seriously hurt because she was covered in blood and still they did nothing to try and help			2
' i was a complete mess			0
all i could see was blood and @entity1 was screaming asking me to help her and not leave her			2
' it 's disgusting that a three - year - old has been put through that			2
' i feel so angry when i think of those lads			0
i 'm begging anyone who might know who did it to contact the police			0
justice needs to be done			0
' police would urge anyone who believes they may know the identity of the riders or the owners of the bikes , or who may have seen the bikes in the area at the time , to please contact the police on 101 , or @entity122 anonymously on 0800 555111 , quoting incident number 634 of 3/7/13 .			2
