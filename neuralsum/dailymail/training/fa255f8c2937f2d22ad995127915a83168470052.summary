ancient texts uncovered in @entity2 village @entity1 suggest @entity5 workers had state - supported health care many of us consider national health services as relatively new innovations of the 20th century , but they appear to have much older origins			1
ancient texts uncovered among the human remains of an @entity2 village suggest workers from the @entity5 had their own version of a state - supported health care			1
this scheme , which involved paid sick leave and on - site doctors , made sure workers making the king ’s tomb 3,600 years ago were productive and well looked after			1
the dig of the ancient @entity2 worker ’s village at @entity1 is being led by @entity27 archaeologist @entity26			1
the village was built for workmen who made the royal tombs during the @entity5 ( 1550 to 1070 @entity31 )			1
during this period , kings were buried in the @entity34 in a series of rock - cut tombs			2
the village was purposely built close enough to the royal tomb to make sure the workers could hike there on a weekly basis			1
‘ these workmen were not what we normally picture when we think about the men who built and decorated ancient @entity2 royal tombs - they were highly skilled craftsmen , ’ said dr @entity42			1
‘ the workmen at @entity1 were given a variety of amenities afforded only to those with the craftsmanship and knowledge necessary to work on something as important as the royal tomb			1
’ according to ancient texts found on the site , as well as other historical accounts , the @entity2 state paid workers monthly wages in the form of grain and provided them with housing and servants to help with laundry , grinding grain and porting water			1
the worker ’s families lived with them in the village , and their wives and children could also benefit from these provisions from the state			1
among these texts are also numerous daily records detailing when and why individual workmen were absent from work			1
nearly one - third of these absences occurred when a workman was too sick to work , for example			2
the village ( marked ) was built for workmen who made the royal tombs during the @entity5 ( 1550 to 1070 @entity31 )			1
during this period , kings were buried in the @entity34 in a series of rock - cut tombs			2
@entity1 was built close enough to the royal tomb to make sure the workers could hike there each week ancient texts found among human remains ( pictured with lead archaeologist @entity26 ) include daily records detailing when and why workers were sick and reveal they were also paid a certain amount of sick leave			1
other papyri describe on - site physicians who would treat the workers as part of their employment yet , monthly ration distributions from @entity1 were consistent enough to suggest these workmen were paid even if they were out sick for several days , explained dr @entity42			1
‘ these texts also identify a workman on the crew designated as the swnw , physician , ' she continued			2
‘ the physician was given an assistant and both were allotted days off to prepare medicine and take care of colleagues			0
‘ the @entity2 state even gave the physician extra rations as payment for his services to the community of @entity1			1
’ this physician would have most likely treated the workmen with remedies and incantations found in his medical papyrus			2
these texts acted like a reference book for the ancient @entity2 medical practitioner , listing individual treatments for different ailments			2
the longest medical papyrus ever found is the @entity134 ( pictured )			0
it contains more than 800 treatments for eye problems to digestive disorders texts found on the site of @entity1 identify a workman on the crew designated as the ' swnw ' , or physician			1

these texts acted like a reference book for the ancient @entity2 medical practitioner , listing individual treatments for different ailments			2
the longest of these ever found is called @entity134 and contains more than 800 treatments covering eye problems to digestive disorders			0
the source of the papyrus is unknown , but it was said to have been found between the legs of a mummy in the @entity163 necropolis			0
a suggested treatment for a condition that had symptoms similar to asthma is listed as a mixture of herbs heated on a brick so the sufferer could inhale the fumes			0
another treatment , this time for intestinal worms , required the physician to cook the cores of dates and a desert plant called colocynth together in sweet beer			0
he would then have sieved the warm liquid and gave it to the patient to drink for four days			0
while smearing a paste of dates , acacia , and honey to wool and applying it as a pessary would be used as a form of contraception by the worker 's wives			0

some of these ancient @entity2 medical treatments required expensive and rare ingredients that limited who could afford to be treated , but the most frequent ingredients found in the texts tended to be common household items like honey and grease			2
one text from @entity1 indicates that the state rationed out common ingredients to a few men in the workforce so that they could be shared among the workers			1

paintings on the walls of @entity246 ’s tomb in the @entity34 is shown egyptologist dr @entity26 ( pictured ) also said she found evidence of both health care and significant occupational stress in human bones recovered from the site			1
according to ancient texts the @entity2 state paid workers monthly wages in the form of grain and provided them with housing and servants despite paid sick leave , medical rations and a state - supported physician , it is clear that in some cases the workmen were working through their illnesses			1
for example in one text , a workman called @entity268 attempted to go to work after being sick			0
dr @entity42 said : ‘ the text tells us he descended to the @entity275 on two consecutive days , but was unable to work			0
‘ he then hiked back to the village of @entity1 where he stayed for the next ten days until he was able to work again			1
‘ though short , these hikes were steep [ and ] @entity280 ’s movements across the @entity163 valleys were likely at the expense of his own health			0
’ dr @entity42 said this suggests sick days and medical care were not ‘ magnanimous gestures of the @entity2 state ’ , but were calculated provisions designed to make sure the workers were as productive as possible .			0
