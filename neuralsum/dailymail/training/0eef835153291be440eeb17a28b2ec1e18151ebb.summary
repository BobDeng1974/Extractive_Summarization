the future of the @entity2 rail project was thrown into doubt last night after devastating evidence exposed the full extent of the environmental havoc that will be wreaked by the high - speed line			1
information obtained by @entity9 reveals @entity2 will blight the lives of more than 500,000 unsuspecting people along a 40 - mile - wide corridor through the heart of @entity14			1
according to @entity2 ’s own information , during the seven - year construction phase , huge convoys of trucks will rumble through dozens of peaceful towns and villages far from the line itself , bringing chaos and congestion in their wake			1
the convoys could also put lives at risk , warn campaigners from the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) who forced @entity2 bosses to disclose the bombshell information			1
the report will fuel growing pressure on the government to abandon the scheme			1
would @entity2 be good for @entity38 ? @entity39 has said he is determined to go ahead with it , but faces mounting opposition from @entity43 mps whose constituencies face being cut to shreds by the scheme			1
but this newspaper has established that several cabinet ministers – including , crucially , environment secretary @entity47 – have doubts about @entity2			2
a well - placed source said : ‘ @entity47 ’s view is that he will subject it to such tough environmental tests that he will kill off the whole thing			2
’ the @entity30 analysis – published in the form of maps available online from today – will reinforce those who agree with mr @entity47			2
and the doubts have spread to senior figures in other parties			0
former labour trade minister @entity62 has questioned @entity2 ’s viability , while @entity65 leader @entity64 has been a long - term fierce critic of the scheme			1
until now , official consultation exercises on the estimated £ 50 billion project had suggested only those living closest to the proposed route would suffer any impact on their lives and the value of their homes			2
countryside at @entity76 , @entity77 , where the proposed route will go past , scenic views across the @entity77 countryside threatened by the proposed @entity2 link between @entity81 and @entity82 but after weeks of requests from the @entity30 , @entity2 finally released a starkly different picture of the dramatic effects of the construction phase , which will last up to seven years , set to begin in 2017			1
@entity30 senior transport campaigner @entity87 said : ‘ it is not acceptable that it took a charity to uncover this and let up to half a million people know that they will be affected by this project			1
’ the @entity30 ’s inquiries revealed : controversial : stop @entity2 protest signs in @entity97 , @entity98 where locals are concerned over the impact the link will have on their countryside he said : ‘ we asked @entity2 for all the data on the construction and the scheme itself			1
the draft @entity109 was published on may 16 and that ’s when we asked for the full data			0
‘ i was chasing the data all the time and they just kept saying “ it ’s coming by email ” or “ it ’s in the post ”			0
’ when @entity9 broke the news to mps , councillors and residents in the affected communities , we were met with shock at the scale of the impending invasion – and anger that no one had warned them			0
@entity129 @entity43 mp @entity128 predicted an ‘ appalling ’ impact on her constituents from construction and called for compensation			0
‘ there ’s no doubt that residents are devastated by the prospect of the noise , traffic and pollution in such beautiful and ancient countryside , ’ she said			2
‘ the impact during construction is going to be appalling and will damage @entity129 for ever			0
it is already leaving hundreds of home owners with permanent blight and misery , as well as huge financial loss			0
actor @entity148 has thrown his weight behind the no campaign , pictured at a protest in @entity152			0
@entity153 , @entity98 , which is in the path of the proposed route for the @entity2 rail line ‘ if this project goes ahead , there has to be generous compensation including a property bond to make sure people can move on with their lives , ’ she added			1
‘ hearing about the prospective construction blight right across my constituency just adds to the need for hard and convincing evidence that @entity2 will give taxpayers value for money versus other possible infrastructure projects			1
’ experts at the @entity174 have calculated that the spoil from tunnelling in their area alone could result in 1.7 million lorry journeys , or a truck using local roads every 26 seconds every working day for five years			1
in @entity182 , more than six miles from the line , residents had expected @entity2 to leave them largely unaffected			1
but the @entity30 has discovered the pretty market town , on the ancient @entity184 , will be effectively cut into three by the lorries ’ routes			2
@entity182 ’s mayor and district councillor @entity187 said : ‘ people will be mortified			1
our roads network is already in a shocking state through lack of investment , so having so many of these great big lorries will cause serious damage			2
‘ this will surely affect property prices – after all , once these trucks start rolling and prospective buyers see large numbers of these vehicles trundling through , it ’s bound to deter people			1
safety is also a huge concern – we already have around 16,000 vehicle movements a day through @entity182 and only a few weeks back a young boy was knocked down on a zebra crossing and seriously injured			2
’ the film director behind the iconic @entity211 title sequences expressed his horror at trucks coming through his home village of @entity215 , @entity216			2
@entity217 , 57 , owns a manor house which has the village ’s stunning 12th century church in its grounds			0
mr @entity217 said he could scarcely believe he and neighbours had n’t been told about the @entity2 traffic and said : ‘ i think it ’s very underhand and unfair that small villages in rural places should be subjected to something like this for so many years without people being asked about it			1
‘ we already have a traffic problem here so i can only imagine this is going to make it a lot worse			0
’ in @entity236 , @entity129 , @entity237 , 56 , a project manager for @entity238 , said : ‘ i knew absolutely nothing about this			0
why is it not part of the public consultation process ? ‘ we need to be aware about this if it ’s going to have a significant negative impact on our house prices			0
‘ we only moved here six months ago , to get away from it all			0
it ’s a fantastic place – you come here to forget about everything			0
but if huge convoys of lorries are going up and down 24/7 , there ’s going to be a hell of a noise			1
’ in the tiny village of @entity257 , @entity258 67 , shuddered at the prospect of more heavy lorries storming past her 16th century cottage , which sits on a busy tight bend			0
the retired @entity265 administrator , whose home was built in 1556 , said : ‘ this road is already an absolute nightmare			0
the traffic is constant and never stops as it is			0
‘ i do n’t understand why they are wasting so much money on a high - speed rail line when we need a bypass around the village			2
to me , it ’s a total nonsense			0
‘ we have two schools in the village and i do n’t think any one has thought about the safety aspect of having heavy goods vehicles coming through			0
it ’s a recipe for disaster			0
’ in a statement , the @entity30 said : ‘ @entity2 was supposed to free up space on the railways to get lorries off the roads			1
progress : the @entity290 pictured in 1971 , many supporters of @entity2 liken critics to those who opposed the building and expansion of the central motorway in the fifties and sixties fierce critic : @entity65 leader @entity64 is strongly opposed to @entity2 ‘ but people in dozens of sleepy villages many miles from the route will be finding out today that it could mean the opposite for them			1
‘ the plans for building it would mean endless convoys of lorries taking to their local roads , at best destroying their peace and quiet , at worst putting local people ’s lives in danger			1
‘ less than ten per cent of the materials required to build @entity314 were taken by road			0
‘ the government seems not to want to try to beat the standard set by @entity314 in terms of minimising @entity320 construction traffic on local roads			1
this simply is n’t good enough			0
‘ if these roads are not going to break up under the strain , the government needs to give additional funding to local authorities to tackle the maintenance backlog for roads in the areas likely to be affected			2
‘ many rural roads have no safe space for walking , cycling or horse riding , so new parallel paths should be considered along routes likely to be affected by construction traffic			1
’ @entity337 , from the @entity338 , a campaign group set up to challenge the high - speed rail link , said : ‘ the government has not been honest about how extensively @entity2 will blight people ’s homes and disrupt their lives			1
‘ experience shows that people on the route lose 30 per cent of the value of their homes			0
‘ so people who thought they were safe from @entity2 will be given an unpleasant surprise			2
’ among the other effects of @entity2 will be that areas of tranquillity such as @entity355 in @entity129 , site of the @entity357 , and the village of @entity359 , @entity360 , will face disruption in phase two of the project , the lines extending from @entity363 to @entity82 and @entity364 will blight other peaceful spots , such as @entity368 in @entity369 and @entity370 and @entity371 in @entity372			1
several picturesque locations will also be permanently transformed by embankments , viaducts and cuttings , including @entity377 in @entity378 , @entity379 , which could face demolition , and a @entity382 site at @entity383 in @entity384 , @entity385 , where a viaduct could be built			0
an @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ we have considered all construction access routes as part of the development of the draft environmental statement on which we consulted earlier this year			2
‘ the consultation was open to all members of the public to respond and express potential concerns or suggest alternatives			0
we have sought to provide construction access with minimal disruption and will continue to work with local communities to take on board their views			0
‘ in developing the subsequent formal @entity402 , we will be considering how we can further reduce any adverse impacts			0
’ the spokesman added : ‘ @entity2 is still developing transport routes for the construction of the line , accordingly it is not possible to definitively say how the road network will be used			1
the information supplied to the @entity30 is based on the most accurate assessment , given the progress of the line ’s design at the time			2
