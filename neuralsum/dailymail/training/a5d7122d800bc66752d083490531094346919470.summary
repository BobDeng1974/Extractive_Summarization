by @entity0 published : 05:16 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 08:46 est , 12 april 2013 campaign : protester @entity2 claims getting @entity3 ! the witch is dead to number one would be ' cathartic ' for many a protester behind a campaign to get @entity9 song @entity3 ! the witch is dead to number one in the charts believes buying the july @entity13 hit is ' cathartic ' for those who hated the @entity16 prime minister			1
@entity2 , 39 , denies his cause is wrong and disrespectful to the @entity18 , claiming : ' it is not about the song , it is giving people a voice '			0
his campaign , backed by left - wing agitators , has caused the song from the @entity28 to rise in the pop charts this week , and now sits at number three , @entity24 has learned			1
as well as rising up the official charts , the track , which costs 79p online , is currently @entity34 on @entity35 , and the @entity36 is planning to play the song on sunday			1
in the past , songs deemed to be too controversial have been banned from the airwaves by the @entity36			2
meanwhile counter-protesters have today launched a late campaign to encourage people to buy : ' @entity43 ' , a 1980 punk single by the @entity45			2
' i am not an anarchist , and i am not going out to protest			0
this is a group of normal people who want be heard			0
i wanted to help this community , ' mr @entity2 told @entity24			0
' i feel a bit of sympathy for her			0
to have something like this marking her death shows how strongly feel about her			1
' it is a comment about her as a state figure and what she did , not about her as a person or her family			0
people are n't having a go at her as an old lady			0
' she never said sorry for anything she did			0
she did not make @entity71 great , she took a lot away from @entity71			0
' i think there is quite a tidal wave of emotion with this and it is a very cathartic experience for a lot of people who feel that for many years they have n't been listened to			1
i think they now feel they are being listened to			2
' the big difference between this song and what @entity82 never did is listen to people			1
i do n't think she even listened to her cabinet '			2
climbing up the charts : @entity89 track which has had a surge of popularity in the wake of @entity82 's death is on course for a place in the top five online push : a message running on the @entity100 group which has been set up to push the song to number one in this week 's chart mr @entity2 , who describes himself as a humourist , writer and event curator , criticised national newspapers who have been critical of his campaign , calling them ' out of touch '			1
but he and the thousands who have been buying the pop song have been called ' feeble ' , ' deeply offensive ' and ' disrespectful ' by those against them			2
@entity116 confronted mr @entity2 on @entity118 's @entity117 this morning			0
' i think this is a pretty feeble form of protest , ' he said			0
' the way to treat this is the way that @entity82 would have treated it - to rise above it with dignity and maybe some disdain			2
' the one thing we should n't do is censor a song that which after all has been around for 50 years or more			2
' this is an opportunistic move by a group of protesters to get a bit of publicity for them and their cause			0
' people who have respect for @entity82 and her views will not find this anything other than a distasteful affair			2
' people have been listening to this song for decades			0
it is not new , what is new is that people like you are trying to get cheap publicity			0
' @entity150 leader @entity149 said today : ' if you suppress things then you make them popular , so play the b * * * * * thing			0
if you ban it it will be number one for weeks			0
' personally i think that the behaviour of these yobs - most of whom were n’t even born when @entity82 was in power - is horrible , offensive and disgusting '			2
row : mr @entity163 and former mp @entity116 clashed over the campaign on @entity118 's @entity117 this morning insiders confirmed yesterday that , in a decision which will cause widespread outrage , @entity3 ! will feature in @entity168 's sunday - evening @entity170 countdown			1
before it is played , it is planned to use a reporter from the @entity174 news programme @entity175 to explain to the station 's target audience of young listeners why the song has risen in the charts			1
mps from both @entity182 and the conservative party united in saying it would be wrong to give airtime to a song denigrating our greatest peacetime prime minister less than a week after her death			2
the ruling comes after accusations of ' left - wing bias ' over the @entity36 's coverage of @entity82 's death			1
it could be the first major leadership test for new director general @entity196 , the chairman of the @entity198 and sport select committee warned last night			0
@entity199 said : ' this is an attempt to manipulate the charts by people trying to make a political point			0
most people will find that offensive and deeply insensitive , and for that reason it would be better if the @entity36 did not play it			1
it 's a political act			0
the @entity36 will now need to decide if they will play the 1939 tune during @entity168 's top 40 countdown , hosted by @entity211 , left			1
it is still some distance behind the week ’s biggest selling single , @entity214 ( 100 % ) by @entity215 , right , ft a * m * e place in the charts : the song is also on course to become the shortest top 10 single ever , with the most popular version running to 51 seconds the power of a @entity100 campaign should not be underestimated			1
in 2009 a @entity100 campaign was designed to prevent another @entity226 number one			0
as a consequence rock band @entity227 won the most competitive battle in years for the @entity230 number one			0
the band 's single , @entity231 , sold 500,000 downloads beating @entity226 winner @entity235 's the climb by 50,000 copies to clinch the top spot			1
' sometimes the @entity36 has taken the decision not to play a record because it is offensive , such as the @entity242 ' @entity241 , but that is a matter for the director general , who will be appearing before my committee in two weeks			1
' @entity182 backbencher @entity247 added : ' obviously nobody wants censorship of music or culture but there has to be dignity in death			0
while i disagreed with everything she stood for , she was a leader and a prime minister so i do n't think it would be a good idea to promote that single			2
' @entity3 ! @entity3 was written for the soundtrack of the 1939 film @entity89 and sung by @entity13 , who played @entity262 , the @entity263 and @entity264 , played by @entity265			0
the song , written by @entity267 and composed by @entity268 , is sung as they celebrate the death of the @entity271 after @entity262 ' dropped a house on her '			2
it includes the lyrics : ' @entity276 is dead / she 's gone where the goblins go / below , below , below			0
' since @entity82 died on monday , it has become an anthem of hate for hordes of left - wingers who have set up @entity100 pages encouraging their friends to buy it			1
supporters of @entity82 urged the public to download @entity291 's song @entity292 – the @entity294 codename for the preparations for her funeral – instead			1
decision : in what could be seen as the first major test for the new director general @entity196 , the @entity36 will now have to take a decision about whether they will play the tune during @entity168 's top 40 countdown when places are finalised at the weekend conservative peer @entity305 said : ' so many of these people who are buying this song probably were n't even alive when she was turning this country from being entirely broke , with no future or prospects , into one giving us all hope and enterprise and inspiration			1
i think it 's a great shame if people think it 's the right thing to do to dance on her death			2
' @entity16 mp @entity323 said it would be ' silly and absurd ' for the @entity36 to play the track on sunday			1
he said : ' the song is in particularly poor taste			0
if i was the person in charge of making the decision i would choose not to play that track			1
however , it is ultimately irrelevant			0
@entity82 's towering reputation will survive this			1
she was someone who stood for freedom of expression , so we ca n't ban these sick and misguided protests			0
' another @entity16 mp , @entity323 , defended the @entity36 's decision , saying it had a duty to play the song on its chart show			1
he said : ' it 's a chart programme so if it 's top of the charts they have to play it			1
it 's not for the @entity36 to define on what basis something is in the charts			1
' however i think this whole campaign is pretty pathetic really if the best these left - wingers can achieve in their lives is to campaign for a song			2
compared to @entity82 's achievements around the world , it just shows what a fantastic prime minister she was that she defeated these people time and again and they are still bitter about it			1
' in 1977 the @entity36 refused to play the @entity242 ' anti-monarchy song @entity241 during the @entity366 celebrations			1
it reached number one in the @entity370 music magazine chart , but only number 2 in the official singles chart – selling 150,000 copies in its first week			0
yesterday @entity36 officials officially said no decision had yet been taken on whether to play @entity3 ! on the chart show			1
however , the corporation did not deny an online @entity379 report that a decision had been made to play it if it remains in the top five .			1

@entity383 says those buying song are those who ' have n't been listened to '
' to have this marking her death shows how feel about her , ' he said
@entity394 has now sold *20,000* copies since @entity82 's death on monday
it has been pushed up the charts *due* to an internet campaign
the track , which costs 79p online , is currently @entity34 on @entity35
also on course to become the shortest top 10 single ever at 51 seconds
@entity36 confirms a decision has not been made on whether to play it
