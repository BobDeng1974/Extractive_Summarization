by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 11:56 est , 6 august 2013 the spate of terrifying night - time rapes in an isolated , orthodox @entity4 community went on for four years and yet the victims could barely remember the ordeal and many believed they had dreamed it			1
it was not until 2009 that nine men were eventually convicted of the rape of more than 100 women and girls in their own homes in the @entity15 in @entity16			1
but despite the convictions , it has emerged that the sexual attacks in the closed community are continuing			1
more than 100 women and girls were raped in the @entity15 in @entity16 but despite the convictions four years ago residents have admitted that the sexual assaults have continued ( file picture ) an investigation has uncovered that once more women and youngsters in the @entity30 , where motorised vehicles and electricity are banned , are suffering sexual assaults they can barely remember			1
@entity34 has found that many families believe the assaults are continuing despite the men , aged 19 to 43 , being jailed			1
but members of the closed community told @entity34 that without cameras or streetlights - both forbidden in the community - or a police force , they have no way to stop or catch the rapists			1
they say they will have to wait until someone is caught in the act and in the meantime increase security at their homes			0
one husband , whose wife was raped in the first spate of attacks , told @entity34 : ' it 's definitely not as frequent			2
[ the rapists ] are being much more careful than before , but it still goes on			0
' from 2005 to 2009 , women complained that they regularly woke up to intense pain and semen and blood on their sheets but their claims were not initially investigated and they were not believed			1
some even reported waking up to find rope tied to their wrists or ankles or dirty fingerprints on their bodies but the victims could not remember the previous night			2
many women had hazy memories or images of at least one man on top of them but they were not able to resist			2
residents say they have heard repeated rumours that the night - time rapes have continued but because the closed community does not have a police force the alleged crimes are unlikely to be investigated ( file picture ) the @entity15 in eastern @entity16 is home to about 3,000 people the eventual trial found that the attackers used a powerful sedative to drug whole families before carrying out the rapes			1
many women were attacked as they lay next to their husbands , who were also knocked unconscious by the narcotic			2
a girl of just three was among the victims and a woman of 60 years old			0
a pregnant woman gave birth at just six and a half months after being raped while unconscious			0
young girls were taken to hospital the next morning suffering from terrible pain and bleeding			0
the gang of men , who had led some women to believe they were repeatedly attacked by demons , were eventually caught and jailed in 2009			1
two of the men were found trying to break into a house and their story unraveled			0
each of the nine - strong gang were jailed for 25 years and a vet who supplied the anaesthetic - made from a cow tranquilizer - was sentenced to 12 years			1
the colony - about 94 miles from @entity115 and home to about 3,000 ultraconservative @entity117 - has been deeply scarred by the scandal			1
@entity119 told @entity34 that she tried to stay awake and asked a trusted worker to guard the house but the attacks continued when no one was watching her home			1
she said : ' it happened so many times , i lost count			0
' some residents initially believed the rape claims were concocted to hide affairs while others believed it was down to ' wild female imagination			1
' electricity is banned in the @entity136 and the community lives off the land			0
men and women 's roles are strictly segregated with men working as farmers and given extra education whereas women only are responsible for cleaning and cooking			1
the community has no police force so no one investigated the claims until two men were finally caught trying to break into a neighbour 's house			2
before that there had been no investigation and the authorities were accused of turning a blind eye to the situation			0
@entity160 , @entity15 's civic leader told vice : ' that 's all behind us now			2
we 'd rather forget than have it be at the forefront of our minds			0
' we only knew that something strange was happening in the night			0
' but we did n't know who was doing it , so how could we stop it ? ' offers of help from outside of the colony , including from more liberal @entity176 communities in @entity177 and elsewhere , were rejected			1
orders for psychological help for victims has also never materialised			0
@entity117 do not use motorised vehicles or electricity @entity117 are @entity183 that can be traced from @entity185 groups on @entity186			0
they follow the teachings of @entity189 priest @entity188 , who gave the group his name			0
there are about 1.7million mennonites in 82 countries , with prominent communities in @entity177 , the @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , and parts of south and @entity201 including @entity16 , @entity202 and @entity203			2
almost 400,000 @entity117 live in the @entity196 with more than 220,000 living in the @entity205			0
the vast majority of @entity16 's @entity176 population are ultraconservative			1
over the centuries , members have been severely persecuted and partially due to their pacifism @entity176 fled to other lands where they were tolerated			2
in the @entity136 , motorised vehicles , electricity , dance and sport are all banned			0
@entity216 tend to use horse and buggies for transportation and speak in a @entity221 dialect .			0

in 2009 , nine men in a @entity16 @entity176 community were jailed for raping at least 100 women and girls
the gang used a powerful sedative *adapted* from a tranquilizer to drug households before carrying out the attacks at @entity15
women were not initially believed despite waking to blood - *soaked* sheets
despite the convictions , it has emerged attacks in the colony have continued
