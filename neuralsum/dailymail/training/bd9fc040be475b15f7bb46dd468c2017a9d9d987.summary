@entity0 has urged star man @entity1 to produce a big performance away from the @entity3 in his battle with @entity5 on sunday			1
two of the deadliest attacking threats in the @entity8 go head - to - head when @entity11 travel to @entity12			1
@entity1 has been a revelation since joining from @entity14 in a £ 30million summer move , scoring 18 goals for the @entity17			1
however , only four of those have come away from home , while he was not quite up to his usual high standards in the matches at top - four rivals @entity23 and @entity24			2
@entity1 , pictured after scoring against @entity25 , has found the net just four times away from home the @entity11 frontman has been urged to produce a big performance away at @entity12 on sunday @entity1 ( left ) and his @entity11 team - mates look dejected after conceding away to @entity32 in november ‘ yes , at @entity24 and @entity23 he was n’t at his best , ’ admitted @entity0			1
‘ it ’s maybe because the team has not been as effective away from home , because when you are a striker you depend a little bit on how much your team pushes forward			2
‘ but he can use that as a motivation to play well on sunday			2
as a team we did n’t play well as we would like ( against @entity23 and @entity24 ) and it was difficult for the strikers to get good balls			0
but he has had some good away games , too			0
’ @entity11 legend @entity47 — who will make his debut as a @entity50 pundit for the clash at the @entity52 — said this week that @entity1 has the potential to be @entity0 ’s best ever signing			1
producing a match - winning display against @entity57 ’s side on sunday would further those claims			2
@entity1 celebrates by punching the air after scoring during @entity11 's home victory against @entity61 on sunday ‘ it ’s difficult to compare @entity63 , for example , with @entity1 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ all the signings we made this year were good			0
@entity1 is one of the better ones , but you have to consider the price you pay as well to decide that because we paid good money for him			1
‘ but whichever way you look at it , he is good value for money			0
he is one of the fastest to adapt to the @entity8			1
i believe it ’s because he feels accepted by the other players , that he feels he is an important player			0
’ victory against the champions will provide @entity0 ’s men with a huge confidence boost in their attempts to finish in the top - four			1
per @entity83 has a word with @entity85 following @entity11 's 6 - 3 defeat at the @entity52 in december 2013 their record against @entity91 football ’s elite remains a concern for @entity0 , who admits three points over @entity12 could be a pivotal moment in their season			1
‘ we are going through a period where confidence is important , ’ said the @entity97			0
‘ so a big performance could be decisive			1
i feel we have to play with a bit more freedom			0
from every big game you gain confidence when the result is good			0
let ’s focus on going there and giving ourselves a chance to win by putting a great performance in			0
‘ we want to have a good balance between attacking and defending because we know that @entity12 attack very well			1
’ @entity0 believes victory over @entity12 would prove to be a pivotal point in @entity11 's season meanwhile , @entity0 confirmed the signing of @entity119 midfielder @entity118 , pending a successful medical			1
@entity118 arrived in @entity121 on friday to complete his move			0
@entity0 insists the fee for the 17 - year - old is less than the £ 2m that has been touted — but admitted it was a hefty sum to fork out for one so young			2
‘ it ’s an awful lot of money for a player if he does n’t succeed , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ if he does succeed then it ’s cheap			0
he ’s a defensive midfielder , 6ft 2in , he has a good energy level and technical level			0
but on what we saw it ’s worth to take the gamble			0
he will go straight into the first - team squad			0
