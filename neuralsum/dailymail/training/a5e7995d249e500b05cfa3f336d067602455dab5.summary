females may be the fairer sex , but it seems that men like looking at themselves more , taking almost double the number of selfies that women do			1
this trend has arisen because men see showing off using a smartphone as ' acceptable vanity ' , according to a psychologist			1
the general obsession with selfies , however , is affecting @entity15 ' life experiences			2
@entity16 : men taking double the number of selfies than women , according to a @entity22 survey @entity23 was recently named the word of 2013 , beating tough competition from twerk , binge - watch and showrooming			1
editors from @entity29 , which made it their word of 2013 , said the word has evolved from a niche social media tag into a mainstream term for a self - portrait photograph			0

a third admit they ’ve missed a great live moment because they were taking a snap of themselves , according to a survey of 2,000 people			1
experiences are also being missed out on by @entity15 ’ eagerness to upload selfies to social media sites – so everyone else can see their good looks			1

the poll found that 5.4 million people in the @entity71 post these bragging photos within 10 minutes of arriving on holiday , for example , as well as of hotel rooms , in bars and nightclubs and even of their bed			0
men ’s selfie - obsession stems from the fact that it ’s an acceptable form of vanity , according to behavioural psychologist @entity83			1
she told @entity85 : ‘ selfies are modern day vanity			2
men have come to the vanity game later than women			2
they ’re taking selfies because there ’s a technological aspect to them , so they see it as a more acceptable way of revealing their vanity			1
