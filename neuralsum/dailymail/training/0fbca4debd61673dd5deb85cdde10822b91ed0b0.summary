by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 15 june 2013 in the last years of the 19th century , the hamlet of @entity2 in @entity3 was a thriving farming community			2
a new chapel and schoolroom were built , along with a pretty cottage for the schoolmistress			1
but within 20 years , @entity2 and all its homes had been abandoned			0
the @entity11 sounded the death knell for @entity2 – not one of its men returned after the @entity16			1
for almost 50 years it lay abandoned and decaying , until one summer sunday in 1962 it was rediscovered by @entity18 , an @entity20 businessman , and his wife @entity21			1
village for sale : @entity2 in @entity3 , which was saved by the @entity24 in the 1960s and turned into a holiday village , is now for sale ‘ we used to drive down from @entity29 every weekend looking for something to buy but could n’t find anything , ’ says @entity18 ’s widow @entity21 today			1
‘ we ’d stopped at a petrol station and the man told us @entity2 was for sale but he said , “ it ’s not the sort of place for nice people like you			0
” ’ their interest piqued , the couple drove down the twisting roads , took one look and agreed to pay £ 2,000 for the main house , schoolhouse , 15 dilapidated cottages and a range of barns and other buildings in ten acres – then set about restoring the hamlet , which they renamed @entity53			1
for the past 50 years , the restored hamlet – three miles from the village of @entity56 , between @entity57 and @entity58 in @entity59 – has been operating as a busy tourist business , with hundreds of holidaymakers renting its cottages , swimming in its outdoor pool , playing tennis or relaxing in its very own pub , the @entity65			1
new life : horses riders passing the house that @entity69 is building for himself , nicknamed ' @entity70 ' but after half a century , the family is selling up			2
‘ my dad died five years ago and @entity76 ’s now 86 , and there are other things i want to do , ’ says son @entity72 , who is building his own house in the village			1
@entity69 has already sold two two - bedroom cottages for £ 145,000 each , as well as @entity80 , in which he was brought up , for £ 490,000			0
and now the remaining 15 cottages and a barn with planning permission for conversion into a four - bedroom house are on the market with a price tag of £ 2 million			0
of the cottages , seven have one bedroom , five have two , and three have three bedrooms			0
all have their own gardens , and the price also includes the village ’s tennis court , badminton court , play area , pool and ten acres of land , as well as three barns , which currently comprise the pub , laundry and games room			1
‘ when @entity76 and @entity106 came here , all but two of the cottages had been condemned and the only house that was habitable had an outside loo , so they lived in a caravan while they did it up , ’ says @entity69			0
family project : @entity18 and his son @entity69 , aged five , working at @entity53 in the 70s ‘ locals used to drive up here on a sunday to see what these weird people were doing			2
’ within months , the first house was ready for guests and the couple started work on the rest of the village , and along the way they discovered ancient treasures , including an 11th century aspersorium – a vessel for holding holy water			1
‘ this part of @entity3 was popular with pirates and smugglers and they would have come through here because the @entity133 to @entity134 stagecoach used to go straight through @entity135 , ’ says @entity69			1
the couple then converted a former cider barn into @entity138 , which became the family home until they found another hidden property			2
‘ @entity76 was out walking one day and in the undergrowth she came across a chapel , which they did n’t even know existed			2
it was owned by the @entity148 and they bought it and converted it into their own house , ’ explains @entity69			2
today , all the houses have open fires or log - burning stoves , washing machines , dishwashers and microwave ovens , and many families return year after year , not just in summer but all year round			0
‘ we get a lot of people at @entity165 and , in our best year , had a turnover of £ 345,000 , ’ says @entity69 , who was born three years after his parents moved to @entity3 and has no plans to leave @entity138			0
for the past 20 years , he has been building @entity70 , a vast granite structure which , when finished , will have a medieval living room , banqueting hall , kitchen , winter parlour , one bedroom and a bathroom			0
‘ i ’ve got planning permission for a second wing with another 20ft by 40ft bedroom and en suite and rooms below that			0
i ’ll build it in modules and add things as i go , ’ says @entity69			0
estate agent @entity183 , which is handling the sale , has had a lot of interest from buyers who want to carry on running @entity53 as a holiday village , but the prospective purchasers have struggled to find a bank willing to lend to them			1
‘ we had two families who wanted to buy it and run the business together , but getting a mortgage has been a problem , ’ says @entity192 , of @entity193			0
‘ we are currently negotiating with a group of local investors who are looking to split the village and sell off the houses individually			2
’ while tourists , many of whom have returned to @entity53 year after year , will lose out , the holiday village may be worth less than the sum of its parts , so breaking it up could make sense – and a quick profit			1
