two senior nurses at the centre of one of the worst hospital scandals in living memory have been struck off			0
@entity5 , 48 , and @entity6 , 52 , stood accused of ruling the @entity8 unit at @entity9 ‘ with fear ’ by bullying other nurses into covering - up the appalling neglect of patients			1
they are the first two nurses from the trust to be struck off			0
up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died there unnecessarily between 2005 and 2009			2
disciplined : @entity6 , left , and @entity5 , right , faked patient records to meet targets at scandal - hit @entity20			1
today , they were struck off this year a damning report into the scandal concluded that ‘ appalling and unnecessary suffering ’ was inflicted on hundreds of patients who were left ‘ unwashed , unfed and without fluids ’			2
but until now , not a single doctor or nurse had been struck off or even lost their job over the failings , to the dismay of grieving families			0
yesterday the @entity34 banned the two nurses from ever practising again for undermining the public ’s faith in the profession			0
the panel ruled they had conspired to fiddle the figures on waiting times ‘ with sheer dishonesty ’ and had ‘ coerced and frightened ’ other more junior nurses to do the same			2
horrific : up to 1,200 people died unnecessarily at the ' horror hospital ' as managers put benchmarks above patient care mrs @entity5 , who lives in @entity49 , @entity9 , admitted to the three - strong panel she had once said she ‘ did not give a flying f * * * ’ about one of her patients			1
when told by other staff that a patient had requested something , she said : ‘ they want to get f * * * * * * real ’ , the panel heard			1
mrs @entity5 , who qualified as a nurse in 1993 , also allegedly branded @entity61 junior doctors ‘ suicide bombers ’ and ‘ @entity64 ’s mate ’ , in a reference to the @entity67 leader			1
the former ward sister , who worked in the @entity8 department between 2003 and 2009 , also vowed to make one male nurse ’s life ‘ living hell ’ leading him to take an overdose – which he survived			1
mrs @entity6 , who has been a registered nurse since 1992 , bullied staff into lying about the length of times patients waited in @entity8 to meet the government ’s maximum four - hour target			1
astonishingly she is still working at the hospital and since leaving the @entity8 unit in 2009 had been promoted to one of the most senior management positions			1
she is currently clinical site manager – in charge of allocating patients to beds – on a salary of up to £ 47,000 , about £ 10,000 more than her previous nursing role			2
whistleblower : @entity90 said @entity91 - along with @entity92 - would demand junior nurses falsify the times recorded for when patients were discharged whistleblowing nurse @entity90 revealed @entity91 – along with @entity92 – would demand junior nurses falsify the times recorded for when patients were discharged			1
she recalled : ‘ they would frequently lie about discharge times , and pressurise members of staff to lie			1
they would speak nastily and swear at people who did not change the times , or would change the times themselves			2
‘ the drive for targets was obviously a huge thing at the time			0
we were told that jobs might be on the line if we did n’t do it			2
’ @entity112 , who chaired the hearing at the @entity114 , told the two nurses that they had failed to put patients and their care first			1
‘ instead you made the achieving of statistical targets , by honest or dishonest means , your primary aim			0
this was not a one - off failing , rather it was at the heart of the way you worked over a sustained period			0
’ he said they had resorted to ‘ sheer dishonesty ’ by altering paperwork and said they had ‘ coerced and frightened other , often junior , members of staff into doing the same			2
you shouted and swore at them if they did not comply when you should have been setting an example			0
’ @entity139 , who helped expose the appalling neglect at @entity9 following the death of her mother in 2007 , said : ‘ this is the start of accountability in the @entity145			0
we ’re all very pleased at the outcomes			0
but there is clear evidence these nurses should have been suspended long ago by the trust			0
’ she also said it was ‘ frightening ’ that despite being struck off , the pair could still work in hospitals as healthcare assistants			0
the cases began in march but had been repeatedly adjourned and had only begun considering evidence against the pair this week			0
another five nurses from @entity9 are having their cases considered by the @entity34 including the former chief nurse , @entity161			0
@entity162 , chief executive at @entity163 , said : ‘ @entity6 is still employed by the trust			1
we will need to take some time to consider the @entity34 panel ’s findings			0
’ among the most repellent examples of the behaviour of @entity6 was her lack of care and respect for an elderly woman in her final 24 hours			1
she reprimanded the seriously ill patient by calling her a ‘ naughty little monkey ’ for not taking her laxatives , and refused to help lift her from a wheelchair to a bed , saying : ‘ i ’m not doing this			0
i ’m not hurting my back			0
’ whistleblowing nurse @entity90 said the woman , who died the next day from a pulmonary oedema , or fluid on the lungs , had been given ‘ a very uncared - for and undignified last 24 hours ’			2
another patient , who arrived at @entity8 suffering from bleeding after having an abortion , was refused immediate treatment by @entity92 , who said : ‘ she can wait , if you can do that to your baby			1
’ the whistleblower also claimed : ‘ @entity92 would deliberately make patients wait			1
black patients were being made to wait			1
’ when junior nurse @entity193 was scathingly told off by another manager for faking a discharge time , she said she looked at the paperwork and recognised @entity6 ’s handwriting			1
but the senior nurse did not come forward to admit the forgery and was later promoted to her current role as clinical site manager			0
on the wards , @entity5 sent waves of fear through junior staff afraid to challenge her expletive - ridden diktats			1
when one bullied male nurse took an overdose in despair , she said he ‘ should have taken a few more and done the job properly ’			0
the @entity34 was told @entity91 had vowed to ‘ make his life hell and get rid of him in six months ’ and ‘ drive him to drink ’ so that ‘ he would be out of here ’			2
when a colleague was taken to hospital with a head injury , the mother of two is said to have told staff : ‘ i do n’t care if she lives or dies			1
’ @entity61 junior doctors had to put up with appalling racist abuse from the senior nurse			2
she asked one , ‘ what have you got in your rucksack doctor , is it a bomb ? ’ and referred to others as ‘ him in the turban ’ and ‘ her with the yashmak [ veil ] ’ .			0

@entity5 and @entity6 falsified @entity8 discharge times
they wanted to hit target for patients to be dealt with in four hours
hearing told some racist staff even forced black patients to wait longer
