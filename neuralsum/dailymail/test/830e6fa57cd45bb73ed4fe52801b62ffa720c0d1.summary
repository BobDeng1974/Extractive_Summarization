@entity1 president @entity0 said on saturday that diplomacy was the best option to deal with @entity5 's contested nuclear program , two days after the conclusion of a framework agreement with @entity8			1
@entity5 and six world powers determined the outlines of a landmark agreement which would curb @entity5 's nuclear program and potentially lift economic sanctions			1

explaining that he expects a ' robust debate ' on the deal in the @entity1 , @entity0 said he will keep @entity37 apprised of the " substance of the deal			2
" many of @entity0 's @entity42 opponents in @entity37 have been skeptical of a deal with @entity5 and suggested the @entity1 may be giving too much away in its negotiations			1
echoing comments he made hours after the announcement of the agreement , @entity0 highlighted the rigorous inspections to which @entity8 will be subject			0
' if @entity5 cheats , the world will know it			0
if we see something suspicious , we will inspect it , ' he said			0
' so this deal is not based on trust , it ’s based on unprecedented verification			0
' according to outline text agreed to between @entity8 and the @entity58 group -- the @entity1 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 plus @entity63 -- @entity5 must significantly reduce its number of centrifuges in exchange for a suspension of sanctions			2
the outline was a major breakthrough in a 12 - year international crisis over @entity5 's nuclear program , but the final deal has yet to be reached			1

‘ this deal would legitimize @entity5 ’s nuclear program , bolster @entity5 ’s economy and increase @entity5 ’s aggression and terror throughout the @entity89 and beyond , ’ the prime minister said			1
