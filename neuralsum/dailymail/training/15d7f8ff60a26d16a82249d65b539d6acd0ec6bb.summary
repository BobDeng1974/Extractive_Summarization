by @entity1 correspondent a protein that holds one of the secrets to creating life has been discovered by scientists in @entity7 giving hope to childless couples a protein that holds one of the secrets to creating life has been discovered by @entity7 scientists			1
the breakthrough brings hope of better treatment for childless women and could also help in the development of contraceptives			0
the protein , given the name @entity21 after the @entity24 goddess of marriage and fertility , is thought to be studded on the surface of human eggs			1
it is essential for fertility as it ‘ mates ’ with a partner protein on the sperm at the moment of conception			1
@entity21 holds the key to fertility – without it the sperm and egg can not fuse to create new life			1
researcher @entity40 , of the @entity41 near @entity42 , said : ‘ we have solved a long - standing mystery in biology by identifying the molecules displayed on all sperm and eggs that must bind to each other at the moment we were conceived			1
‘ without this essential interaction , fertilisation just can not happen			0
we may be able to use this discovery to improve fertility treatments and develop new contraceptives			0
’ since 2005 , when an essential protein was found on the head of sperm , the search has been on for its female counterpart			2
the @entity41 team created an artificial version of the sperm protein – called @entity65 , after a marriage shrine in @entity67 – and used it to hunt out its egg version			1
on finding @entity21 , they did a series of tests on mice that proved it to be necessary for fertilisation			0
importantly , mice that were unable to make @entity21 seemed perfectly healthy but were infertile			0
although they made eggs , sperm were unable to bind to them , the journal @entity77 reports			2
the experiments also revealed that @entity21 is quickly removed from the surface of an egg after fertilisation occurs			1
this ensures only one sperm binds with the egg and increases the odds of a successful pregnancy			0
it is thought that a similar protein is found on women ’s eggs – and that flaws in it could explain why some couples can not have children			2
if this is the case , women found to have a faulty @entity21 protein could be treated with @entity101 , a special type of @entity103 in which the sperm is injected directly into the egg			1
this would bypass the flawed @entity21 protein			2
dr @entity40 said : ‘ if this @entity21 protein is missing in infertile women , what we can do is perform a very simple genetic screen test that is n’t invasive			2
‘ this would allow is to guide the fertility treatment so that women can proceed directly to @entity101			0
a team at the @entity41 in @entity42 made the breakthrough - giving the protein the name @entity21 after the @entity24 goddess for fertility and marriage			1
stock picture ‘ and that would save the trauma and expense of going through rounds of fertility treatment			0
‘ by identifying this interaction between @entity21 and @entity129 , we now know the identity of the proteins found on the surface of our father ’s sperm and our mother ’s egg that must interact at the moment at which we were conceived – the moment we were made			1
’ researcher dr @entity138 said : ‘ infertility is becoming an increasing problem , especially in @entity142 countries , and it is remarkable that 20 per cent of infertility cases have an unexplained cause			0
‘ we are now testing whether @entity21 is involved in these cases			0
’ dr @entity147 , a @entity148 fertility expert , said : ‘ the identification of the @entity21 protein opens up many exciting prospects			1
perhaps the most obvious biomedical application of this finding is whether screening for this protein could be used as a test of fertility			0
’ the discovery could also lead to new types of contraceptive not be based on hormones – and thus free from the unwelcome side - effects of existing drugs .			0

breakthrough made by scientists at the @entity41 in @entity42
protein given the name @entity21 after the @entity24 goddess of fertility
it is thought to be studded on the surface of human eggs
vital for fertility as it ' mates ' with a partner protein on sperm at conception
@entity21 is key to fertility - without it sperm and egg can not fuse to create life
