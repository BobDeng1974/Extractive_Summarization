@entity0 headed @entity1 into the quarter - finals of the @entity3 with two first half goals against @entity5 but an awful performance from the holders suggested their crown is very much up for grabs this season			1
@entity12 ’s team were booed off after losing 4 - 3 on the night			0
they stumbled into the last eight 5 - 4 on aggregate but @entity0 ’s goals and the return of @entity18 apart , there was little to cheer			2
@entity12 was even asked if he would be surprised if he was sacked after the performance			0
he said he was just concentrating on doing his job and apologised for the display : ‘ it was bad for the image of the club , ’ he said			0

i still believe in the team because i know what they can give but at the moment they are not giving it			0
we are playing very badly			0
we need to train more , work more , we need more of everything			0
’ @entity0 headed in a @entity73 corner on 25 minutes to cancel out @entity86 ’ shock opener and when @entity5 took the lead again on 40 minutes through @entity117 , @entity0 headed in a @entity70 cross to equalise			1
it was his rage at the lacklustre performance from some of his team - mates more than his finishing that was most striking			0
@entity75 scored eight minutes into the second half but @entity1 still allowed @entity5 to level on the night with substitute @entity54 beating @entity48 with a long range shot and when @entity39 got his second five minutes from time it left @entity128 ’s team needing just one more goal for one of the all - time @entity3 shocks			1
the fifth goal never came and @entity1 stumbled over the line but this was hardly a performance to put fear into the rest of @entity35			1
the mood was set before kick - off when supporters jeered @entity12 ’s name as it was announced			0
the credit he earned for winning this competition last season seems to have long since disappeared			0
he needed a positive @entity3 display from his players – he never got one			2
real looked flat going forward and were slow to cover space at the back and when @entity91 crossed from the right on 25 minutes , he found @entity86 with time and space to shoot past @entity48			2
@entity72 , who will leave on a free transfer at the end of the season had failed to follow @entity86 ’ run and @entity48 was beaten too easily			2
@entity0 turned to shout at his sleepy team - mates after he rose to head in @entity73 ’ corner five minutes later but @entity1 did not wake up			1
@entity75 was also on the scoresheet for @entity1 as he re-found his goalscoring touch against @entity5 @entity75 is congratulated by @entity1 team - mate @entity40 after netting past @entity5 goalkeeper @entity32 ( left ) @entity5 left back @entity86 gave the visitors a shock lead at the @entity33 on tuesday night @entity86 ' goal fave the @entity52 side a lift as they looked to pull off a shock victory against @entity1 @entity5 players congratulate the defender after his goal in the 20th minute in @entity1 in the @entity3 @entity39 restored @entity175 's one - goal advantage when he followed up after @entity48 parried the ball into the danger area the @entity179 striker ran back to the halfway line with the ball after scoring against his former club @entity39 's goal at the @entity33 put @entity5 back in front with the score at 2 - 1 in the @entity3 clash @entity5 are starting to gain a reputation for spectacular exits from the @entity3			1
the @entity52 club have been on the losing end of the highest - scoring tie of the round each time they 've been dumped out in the knockout phase			2
they might not have made progress , but @entity5 get full marks for entertainment , as these aggregate scores show ... 2014 , last 16 @entity1 9 - 2 @entity5 2013 , last 16 @entity199 4 - 3 @entity5 2011 , semi-final @entity201 6 - 1 @entity5 @entity202 a @entity69 back pass almost let in @entity39 who then rattled the bar			1
and with his third chance inside five minutes he found the back of the net			0
@entity48 spilled @entity87 ’s shot straight to the @entity179 and , against his old club , he made it 2 - 1			1
@entity0 stepped forward to level once again but a crescendo of whistles still greeted the half - time whistle			1
@entity75 put them 3 - 2 up on the night on 53 minutes but @entity54 beat @entity48 from distance to cause further embarrassment			1
this was the first time since 2009 @entity1 had conceded three at home in @entity35			1
@entity12 immediately brought on @entity18 and @entity71 for @entity72 and @entity70			0
the @entity221 looked to restore some control to midfield but when @entity39 got his second of the game off the underside of @entity48 ’ bar the miracle looked back on for @entity5 ’s 4,000 following			2
@entity76 was jeered when he shot well wide from a good position			0
he is a victim rather than the cause of @entity1 ’s malaise but is starting to struggle in front of the club ’s unforgiving supporters			2
he will be glad that former @entity234 team - mate @entity18 is now back in the side alongside him			0
his return and @entity0 ’s reliability were the plus points for @entity1 on a night when they answered more questions than provided answers			2
around 1,000 @entity1 supporters had voted for @entity0 to be dropped earlier this week in a poll organized by @entity244 newspaper @entity243			2
whether they were at the @entity33 on tuesday night or at home clicking other online surveys it is impossible to know			0
once again @entity1 ’s @entity248 had been head and shoulders above the rest and had he not been , next friday ’s quarter - final draw might even have been missing the name of the ten - times winners			1
