@entity1 coach @entity0 weathered his first major crisis at the @entity4 club after his team crushed @entity6 7 - 4 on aggregate on tuesday to move into the @entity8 last four			1
the @entity9 in his second season in charge was with his back to the wall after their surprise 3 - 1 first leg defeat in @entity17 last week			1
never had one of his teams lost before the semi-finals in the competition but that prospect suddenly seemed real			0
@entity1 celebrate in front of their delighted fans after overturning a first leg deficit to reach semi-finals @entity27 jumps highest to head the home side in front on 14 minutes and set the @entity1 on their way @entity31 to succeed , @entity0 repeatedly said he was aware of what he needed to deliver at the five - time @entity34 champions for who a league and @entity37 double was just not enough			1
he arrived at @entity1 after their 2013 treble - winning season and expectations have not been lowered since			2
a semi-final exit last season only heightened pressure on @entity0 to deliver another treble this time round			2
but plagued by injuries in recent months and a rare internal strife after long - time team doctor @entity48 quit after 38 years , saying his medical team was blamed for the loss to @entity6 , @entity1 had a far - from - perfect preparation			1
the doctor is hugely respected by @entity1 players with many saying they would continue taking his advice and @entity0 suddenly in the firing line for allegedly falling out with a @entity1 icon			2
@entity0 said after the game that winning is a matter of life and death at @entity1 @entity62 made it three on 27 minutes as the @entity64 striker powerfully nodded the ball into the net failure to advance against @entity6 would have added to an already difficult week and would no doubt fan speculation about the coach 's future in @entity73 despite having a contract to 2016			1
with @entity77 clubs circling , a slip - up on tuesday could prove decisive for both the club and the coach			0
but the @entity9 , who won 14 titles in his four seasons at @entity82 , thrived under adverse conditions with his team playing arguably their best game this season , even without injured @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
@entity1 frontman is congratulated by @entity92 ( left ) , defender @entity93 ( centre ) and @entity95 ' i felt it in the last few days that we would advance , ' @entity0 said after @entity1 fired five goals in 26 first - half minutes			1
' this is about life or death and i know how very important it was , ' he said			0
' i know what is expected of me in this team			0
it is about winning just like at @entity82			2
' fans are now dreaming of a trophy on @entity4 soil in june 's final in @entity111 and with players gradually returning from injury , @entity0 is confident @entity1 will further improve			1
' we can play even better , ' he said in what is no doubt a warning to other title contenders			0
' after the loss in @entity6 the players were my heroes			0
now it 's easy to love them			0
