' @entity0 ' : the news will alarm a growing number of jam - makers the threat of jam - makers being fined under @entity7 rules for selling or donating produce in re-used jars triggered anger and exasperation yesterday			1

the @entity7 regulations ban the re-use of containers unless they are specifically designed for this			1
