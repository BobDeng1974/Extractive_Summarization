happy families : @entity5 ( @entity65 ) and her husband @entity16 ( r ) also have an 11 - year - old daughter @entity67 ( c ) who has welcomed her four new siblings with open arms medical marvels : the girls were born more than two months early and had to spend three months in intensive care before being allowed to go home following the surprise birth of their four daughters , the @entity49 were forced to endure many more ups and downs , as the young girls were whisked straight into the neonatal intensive care unit , having been born more than two months early			1
' when the babies were born more than two months early , they weighed between 2 and 2½ pounds and were critically ill , ' @entity5 explained			1

since then , the @entity113 have been happily settling into their new routine , which @entity5 admits can be incredibly stressful at times , particularly when ' they are all crying at once '			0
but despite the day - to - day chaos of raising four babies , as well as their older daughter @entity67 , @entity5 insists that she and husband @entity16 could n't be happier			2
