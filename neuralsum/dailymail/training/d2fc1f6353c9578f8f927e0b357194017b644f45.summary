this is according to latest research that suggests tuning into a certain programme this @entity12 can change the way a festive drink tastes			1
according to the study , @entity15 should be paired with @entity17 while @entity18 tastes better with the @entity12 special			1
latest research suggests tuning into certain tv programmes this @entity12 can change and enhance the way a festive drink tastes the study , carried out by @entity22 on behalf of @entity23 , asked 50 people to rate wines , beer and brandy while watching four classic @entity29 shows			1
unbeknown to the participants , the drinks served remained constant however the flavours and characteristics detected by the group changed considerably depending on which programme they were watching			2
@entity17 seemed to produce the strongest response , with people rating the drinks as more elegant and refined when watching the popular period drama			1
they were also significantly more likely to pick out traditional @entity42 flavours which would have been popular in @entity44 times when the series is set			0
of all of the programmes shown , @entity17 elicited the strongest response , with respondents rating the drinks as more elegant and refined when watching the popular period drama these included vanilla , mint and cherry in the red wine ; grassy , floral flavours in the beer ; and rose , wood and oak in the brandy			1
researchers suggest that based on these flavour preferences , an elegant @entity15 with notes of dark fruit , vanilla and mint would be the perfect red wine pairing when catching up on the latest escapades of the @entity68 family			2
when watching @entity70 , 16 per cent of respondents were more likely to rate drinks as fun , 22 per cent as more refreshing and 11 per cent as more enjoyable			1
they were also more likely to pick out sweet and fruity flavours , some similar to those found in @entity77 ’s beloved @entity76			2
when watching @entity70 , 16 per cent of respondents were more likely to rate drinks as fun , 22 per cent as more refreshing and 11 per cent as more enjoyable flavours included cherry in the red wine , fruit in the beer , and apricot , apple and citrus in the white wine			1
when tuning into @entity89 the drinks were more likely to be rated as fun , refreshing and elegant reflecting the nature of the show and costumes			1
meanwhile people watching @entity96 rated the drinks as more refreshing and lively but overall less refined			1
they were also more likely to pick out sharp notes , such as bitter in the beer and cherry in the red wine perhaps reflecting the show ’s tumultuous story lines			0
with @entity96 , respondents rated the drinks as more refreshing and lively but overall less refined			1
they were also more likely to pick out sharp notes , such as bitter in the beer and cherry in the red wine perhaps reflecting the show 's tumultuous story lines ‘ we all know that tasting is a multisensory experience , with sight and smell almost as important as taste but this study shows that the effects of sight and sound expand way beyond the glass , ’ said @entity109 , of @entity22			0
‘ what we are seeing here is cognitive priming theory where the stimulus , in this case the tv programme , sets up our brains and in turn our taste buds to respond in a certain way			0
’ traditionally , scientists have thought the tongue , nose , and brain changehow people experience the flavours of food and drink			0
when watching @entity70 , respondents were more likely to pick out sweet and fruity flavours , some similar to those found in @entity77 's beloved @entity76 more recently , studies have found that what you see can be just as important			1
and it 's not just the programmes you watch that can affect the taste of your drink			0
according to professor @entity150 , the room you ’re in has a much larger impact on your taste buds than you might think			0
his latest study undertaken in october found that different environments can affect the sensory experience of whisky by as much as 20 per cent			0
the room you 're in has a much larger impact on your taste buds than you might think			2
the grassy room featured a green light , real grass , plants , the sounds of lawnmowers and sheep and the smell of the countryside in what professor @entity150 described as the world ’s first science experiment to look at how the surroundings can impact flavour perceptions , three hundred whisky drinkers were let loose in a bar			1
the specially designed @entity178 in @entity180 ’s @entity179 saw people tasting exactly the same single malt whisky in three rooms that had very different environments			0
they then had to rate the different flavours they were able to taste in each room			2
the first was a grassy room which featured a green light , real grass , plants , the sounds of lawnmowers and sheep and the smell of the countryside			2
the second was a fruity room with red , round fruits and chiming bells hung on the ceiling			0
a final aftertaste room had wood panels and sounds of crackling wood fires			0
‘ the ratings of the grassiness in the grassy room were about 15 to 20 per cent higher than in the sweet or aftertaste room , ’ said professor @entity150 ‘ similarly the sweetness of the whisky in the red room was about 10 per cent higher than in either of the other rooms			0
‘ you can almost think about using the rooms to season , and bring out the flavours , in the drinks			0

when watching @entity89 , drinks were more often rated as fun
during @entity70 , people were more likely to rate drinks as light
@entity221 should be paired with @entity17 and @entity18 with @entity96
earlier research found the room you 're in can also change flavour of drinks
