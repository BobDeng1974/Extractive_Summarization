@entity1 has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the @entity4 and is now targeting just ten , it can be revealed			1
@entity5 , which will today unveil its manifesto , has reduced the number of constituencies where it is concentrating resources as it loses ground in the polls			2
a party strategist said ' something extraordinary ' would now need to happen for it to win in places outside its target list			2
@entity1 has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the @entity4 and is now targeting just ten @entity19 , @entity20 ( majority : con 7,617 ) @entity22 , @entity23 ( @entity5 12,404 ) @entity24 & @entity25 , @entity20 ( @entity5 2,920 ) @entity26 , @entity23 ( con 92 ) @entity27 , @entity28 ( @entity29 714 ) @entity30 & @entity31 , @entity28 ( con 12,426 ) @entity32 & @entity33 , @entity34 ( con 66 ) @entity35 , @entity36 ( @entity37 ) @entity38 , @entity23 ( @entity39 ) @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 ) after @entity5 won the @entity24 and @entity25 by - election last november and gained its second mp , mr @entity1 said the party could go on to win ' dozens of seats ' in the election			1
but @entity5 campaign chiefs have now adopted a ' shotgun ' approach with a far fewer targets			2
mr @entity1 will this morning launch the party 's manifesto in @entity26 , @entity23			1
a @entity5 source said : ' it will be a broad and open offer to those on low and middle incomes			2
that 's something which no other party is doing			0
' among the seats dropped from the list of hopefuls is @entity64 and @entity65 , where candidate @entity5 was replaced after allegations of fraudulent expenses claims			1
the target list includes @entity19 , where mr @entity1 is standing , along with @entity22 and @entity24 and @entity25 , where @entity70 and @entity71 won by - elections after defecting from the @entity73			1
the party also hopes to win in @entity26 , a tight three - way marginal where the @entity73 are defending a majority of just 92			2
another focus is @entity77 and @entity78 , in @entity41 , where it narrowly lost a by - election to labour last october			0
@entity5 's election co-ordinator @entity81 , who masterminded last year 's by - election wins , is organising campaigns in the ten targets			2
the party is helping write campaign literature , organising mailshots to voters and putting up billboards , while other candidates are mostly being left to their own devices			1
@entity22 , where @entity92 defector @entity70 ( left ) is standing for @entity5 , is one of the few seats the party still thinks he can win @entity5 's immigration spokesman has admitted that even the leadership of the party has been left confused by its policy on foreigners moving to @entity100			1
at an event last month @entity101 said the deputy chairman @entity5 , who has written @entity5 's manifesto , did not understand the immigration policy even when he showed her diagrams to explain it			0
it is claimed that mr @entity101 , who was speaking after a meeting in @entity35 , said : ' the problem is , even within my own party , my own deputy chairman , did n't seem to understand it herself despite the fact i actually put picture graphs			0
' i put the numbers on and the point is people confuse immigration			0
immigration consists of loads of different numbers , the number of students , it 's asylum seekers , it 's family members			0
' @entity1 was earlier this month accused of ' making up his policies as he goes along ' after he called for the number of arrivals to be limited at 50,000 a year , but at the same time claimed overall caps on net migration would be ' ludicrous '			0
miss @entity5 this morning said the manifesto would include an immigration limit of 50,000 skilled workers from around the world , adding she was ' proud ' of the policy			0
most pollsters suggest @entity5 is being squeezed , with an @entity141 poll suggesting the party had slipped to 7 per cent on monday , while a poll by @entity144 at the weekend put the party on a two - year low			1
mr @entity1 has maintained that the party is not losing support but appears to have changed his rhetoric , referring to the election as a ' springboard '			1
in an interview at the weekend he suggested @entity5 supporters should vote @entity92 in seats where the party has no chance of winning			1
a senior @entity5 source last night said mr @entity1 could begin discussions with the @entity73 about a post-election deal through ' back - channels ' before the polls close			1
mr @entity1 ' is minded to do confidence - and - supply with whoever offers an @entity165 referendum ' , he said			0
@entity5 's manifesto will include a pledge to fund 6,000 jobs in the police , prison service and @entity171 for military veterans			0
and mr @entity1 is today expected to pledge that his party would spend ' substantially ' more than @entity175 's target of 2 per cent of national income on defence			1
he has previously said that @entity5 would meet the target			0
the @entity73 have refused to commit to the target beyond next year			0
in a bid to bolster faltering opinion poll ratings , mr @entity1 said @entity5 was offering ' serious , fully costed policies ' aimed at voters who ' believe ' in @entity100			1
an in / out referendum on @entity100 's @entity165 membership ' as soon as possible ' , a five - year ban on unskilled migrants coming in to the @entity100 and a points - based system for others are among other key pledges			0
with the party keen to broaden its appeal after a slip in support after surging to victory in last year 's @entity197 elections , the manifesto also offers boosts for first - time buyers , military veterans , small businesses and hospital patients .			0
