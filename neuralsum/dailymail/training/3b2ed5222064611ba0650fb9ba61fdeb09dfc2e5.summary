convicted killer and mob enforcer @entity2 , nicknamed @entity3 , was discovered along with his associate @entity18 after an anonymous tip off to police			1
investigators said they were ' riddled with at least 30 bullet wounds ' and an attempt had been made to burn their bodies following the hit			0
one senior police source said : ' the hit was ordered from @entity13			1
@entity28 was the main target and @entity18 was probably killed because he was with him at the time			1
the fear now is that their could be more blood letting			2
' the bodies were discovered on wasteland in the hamlet of @entity37 , near to the city of @entity39 , on the @entity9 's island stronghold of @entity16			0
@entity28 , 56 , had been deported from @entity13 last year after serving a 10 year jail sentence for drug offences and was in @entity16 negotiating with mob bosses in a bid to secure lucrative trans @entity47 drug deals			1
@entity7 police were aware that he and @entity18 were in @entity16 after being tipped off by the @entity50 and they were named as wanted in a round up of 24 mobsters earlier this week but could not be found			1
investigators say that @entity28 was working as the @entity9 's ' @entity13 ambassador ' and was a key player in the multi-million pound deals using his ties with well known @entity60 godfather @entity58 as his introduction			1
brutal : @entity7 police discovered the ' bullet riddled ' and charred bodies after an anonymous tip - off fears : police are worried the killings could spark a trans - @entity47 gang war with his good looks and smart designer clothes @entity28 could have walked straight of the set of mob tv blockbuster @entity75 but he had a fiercesome reputation who served time for killing his 17 - year - old girlfriend after punching her so hard in the throat she died			1
connections : police believe @entity2 was a high level player in the clan headed by notorious @entity59 @entity58 in jail he also had a powerful reputation , threatening inmates and using his influence as an enforcer for @entity58 to carve himself influence and secure drugs could be smuggled in for inmates			2
he also managed to secure shipments of drugs from @entity94 and there were even rumours that with his good looks he had managed to seduce female guards at a maximum security jail where he was being held			0
unusually , @entity98 had managed to reach a reasonably high level of power within the @entity58 clan			0
but as he was not @entity7 he would never have earned the ultimate accolade of @entity59 and his own crime family			0
@entity28 had arrived in @entity16 last year and had opened a gym in the @entity39 suburb of @entity106 and @entity18 is thought to have arrived last month from @entity13 to visit him , with the last positive sighting of both men being in early april			1
@entity110 , 49 and his brother @entity111 , 51 , have been arrested by police in @entity39 in connection with the murder but they said others were also being sought for the double killing			0
a police spokesman said : ' we had been monitoring @entity121 's activities for several months but he had not been seen since early april			0
he was named in a prosecution order to be arrested and we believe he was involved in drugs trafficking between @entity13 and @entity16			2
' arrested : @entity110 and @entity125 have been detained in connection with the murders ' we also think he was using his links with @entity58 to look into the possibility of importing drugs from @entity132 into @entity16 and then onwards to @entity13			2
we shall be liaising with colleagues from the @entity50 as part of the investigation			0
' @entity58 was the @entity59 of the @entity136 and was released from a @entity138 prison last november after serving a lengthy sentence for three mob murders in the 1980 's			0
during his time in jail a bloody war raged between rival factions in @entity60 for control of his empire and his son @entity147 was a victim , gunned down at the age of 42 three years ago .			0
