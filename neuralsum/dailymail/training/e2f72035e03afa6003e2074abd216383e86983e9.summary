so when @entity2 tried to get into @entity4 ’s new media centre without the necessary pass , he fell at the first hurdle			2
failing to recognise the former @entity12 major , the security men on duty correctly refused to let him into the multi-million pound venue			1
but their professionalism did not go down well with the @entity16 mp			1
‘ i ’m the @entity7 minister			1
you should damn well know who i am , ’ he snorted			2
faced with blank looks from the guards , the usually mild - mannered @entity16 mp is then alleged to have become ‘ very angry ’ – a claim flatly denied by mr @entity2 ’s spokesman			1
a ten minute stand - off followed before someone inside the building vouched for the minister and he was finally allowed in			0
afterwards a security officer recalled how the mp had snapped at him : ‘ he said , “ i ’m the @entity7 minister			1
you should damn well know who i am ”			0
‘ i did n’t have a clue who he was and we have to check everyone ’s identification whoever they are			0
‘ he should know that better than anyone else			0
’ a second guard added : ‘ he said “ i ’m on the television all the time ” , but i had never seen him before			2
i think it was out of order			0
’ the guards complained to supervisors , but were told by press officers to let the former soldier inside so that he could address waiting journalists			0
a source at the @entity52 of the @entity7 and @entity53 said mr @entity2 was ‘ not happy ’ when he was finally allowed into the building			1
blocked : failing to recognise the former @entity12 major , the security men on duty at the new media centre correctly refused to let him into the multi-million pound venue			1
the @entity61 is pictured last night , a spokesman for the @entity63 , said : ‘ the minister had a cordial conversation with one of the security team to get a pass for a media briefing that was beginning shortly			1
‘ it is day one of the main press centre being opened and we are encouraged that thorough security checks are being carried out			0
’ mr @entity2 , mp for @entity74 and @entity75 , was at the opening of the media centre on the same day that giant @entity7 rings were unveiled on @entity79 to mark one month until the start of the @entity81			1
spectacular : @entity79 is lit up on the day the giant @entity7 rings are unveiled decorative : mr @entity2 was at the opening of the media centre on the same day that giant @entity7 rings were unveiled on @entity79 , pictured , to mark one month until the start of the @entity81 but critics questioned the £ 1million price tag that came with the installation			2
the rings cost £ 500,000 to design , construct and maintain , but will be replaced in seven weeks to make way for the @entity53 logo , which will also cost £ 500,000			0
under @entity93 guidelines , the five rings will be replaced by the ‘ three agitos ’ symbol shortly after the @entity7 closing ceremony			2
yesterday , @entity98 mayor @entity100 said : ‘ @entity101 is recognised the world over and , adorned with the famous @entity7 rings , it is the perfect choice to showcase what @entity98 has to offer this summer			2
’ but @entity104 said it was yet another expense , on top of the £ 9.3billion investment from the public purse			0
campaign manager @entity109 said : ‘ @entity79 might provide a pretty photo - piece but taxpayers will rightly ask at what point organisers are going to stop spending their money and show even an ounce of restraint			0
’ last night , a light show at @entity79 showed off the @entity119 - made 13 - ton rings to their full effect .			0

@entity2 did not have the necessary pass to get into the new facility

‘ i ’m the @entity7 minister . you should damn well know who i am , ’ the @entity16 mp snorted
