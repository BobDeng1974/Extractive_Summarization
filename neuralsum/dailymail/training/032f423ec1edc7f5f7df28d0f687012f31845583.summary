tragedy : the @entity8 air disaster killed 23 of the 44 passengers onboard the @entity65 plane which was bringing home members of the @entity27 football team from a @entity69 match mr @entity9 said : ' i ca n't believe police have n't got better things to do than speak to me about a message which i wrote to get people talking			1
it 's another example of a crack down on free speech			2
' if someone is offended by it then i 'm afraid that 's tough on them			2
people die everywhere and i do n't see why this is distasteful			2
' i put it up on the blackboard , there is nothing disrespectful about it			2
people are edging round death all the time , this is the real world , get on with it			2
' i am a @entity27 supporter and went to 500 consecutive matches			2
i do n't find it disrespectful - whoever does needs to get a reality check			0
' to me it is something thought - provoking to make people stop and think			1
last week , i had a message up about planet earth celebrating its 13.82 billion birthday			1
' complaint : a customer at @entity9 's pub , @entity103 , @entity52 , complained to police about his ' thought for the day ' message about the 1958 crash in which 23 people lost their lives the incident occurred after mr @entity9 who has been landlord at the pub for ten years raised eyebrows by writing the message and in yellow and white chalk			1
he said : ' i was not saying anything derogatory about @entity27 or the air disaster			0
it was purely an acronym and if i thought it was offensive i never would have written it			1
' @entity8 was an awful accident and my heart goes out to the people who died and their families and the people who were in the crash			0
it raised eyebrows at first and whilst the reaction rocketed no one could explained why it is offensive - maybe they are seeing something i 'm not			0
' i know @entity59 quite well and we talked about the air disaster			0
he said of all the airports it could have happened it was @entity8 , he said you do n't suppose it means @entity15 intended @entity16			0
' i 'd never thought or heard of that before and i thought that was very clever			1
i wrote on the blackboard , ' just had a conversation with @entity145 and he points out that the air disaster happened at @entity8 and he thinks it stands for this			0
underneath i put that he was a clever man			0
backlash : mr @entity9 , pictured outside his pub , insists he meant no offence when he wrote the acronym about the @entity8 air disaster on a blackboard ' i thought to myself is this offensive but i could n't see that it was			1
what is offensive is opposing fans chanting ' @entity10 ' at @entity27 fans			0
' i was off work on the friday and the barmaid said there was a woman in who she 'd never seen before who said it was extremely offensive and it should be taken down			0
i explained how i 'd got the remark			0
' the next thing i knew was the police were at the pub and they wanted to arrest me			1

i said if he could tell me why then i would take it down			0
he said it was a public order offence			1

i just could n't believe the over reaction			0
' ' in future under my messages i 'll write : ' however if you find offence with the above statements feel free to use your democratic sights to go and drink elsewhere '			1
one customer , said : ' there are normally little quips on the blackboard , but this upset me			1
' a lot of people died in that crash and it was horrific			0
if someone chanted this at a football match they would probably be prosecuted and i think it was right police spoke to the landlord			2
' what he wrote was disrespectful to the people who died			0
' @entity209 , from the @entity27 online fanzine @entity211 , said : ' if i saw that message on a pub wall , i would walk out			2
it 's a disgusting thing to write			0
' i can understand the landlord 's general point that people are too sensitive towards death , but this is not the way to go about proving a point			0
