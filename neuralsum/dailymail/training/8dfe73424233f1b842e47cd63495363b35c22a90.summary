an emotional @entity0 lingered after the final whistle to say a final farewell to @entity3 after his @entity4 picked up a 1 - 1 draw against former club @entity6 in a battle between the @entity9 's top two			1
@entity0 , given a mixed and muted reception by @entity6 fans when he was sent on by city manager @entity13 as a 77th - minute substitute , stayed on the pitch after every other player had disappeared down the tunnel to applaud all four corners of the stadium , and his name was chanted by some of the remaining supporters			1
the 36 - year - old was making his first appearance at @entity3 since leaving @entity6 for @entity4 last summer after 13 years as the club 's record goalscorer			1
‘ it was a bit of a strange day for me , ' admitted @entity0 afterwards			1
' i was excited but a bit nervous because of coming back here			0
as a player here you do n’t even think about it but i knew this would be different			0
but i enjoyed it in the end			0
‘ i was delighted with the reception from both sets of fans			1
@entity6 quite rightly get behind their side but they showed their class and i am very thankful for that			2
’ @entity0 got some applause when he came on for @entity62 but there were also a few jeers			2
the vast majority of @entity6 fans it appears simply tried to ignore him , chanting the name of their team as he made his entrance			1
but there was a more favourable response when he did his little lap of honour at full - time			0
@entity0 has a shot blocked by long - time former team - mate @entity76 ( right ) @entity0 made sure to applaud all four corners of the ground at @entity3 at full time @entity6 , missing key men @entity80 and @entity81 , took a 41st - minute lead through @entity80 's replacement @entity84 but were pegged back before half - time by a @entity87 goal			1
their priority after the interval seemed to retain their five - point advantage at the top of the table and @entity94 's men did n't register a single shot in the second half ast they played out a draw			2
the @entity6 boss did n't speak afterwards – he still claims there is a campaign against @entity6 and is angry at a three - match ban imposed on @entity80 for stamping – but midfielder @entity101 claimed the midweek @entity102 semi-final against @entity104 which went to extra-time had an effect			1
@entity101 said : ‘ it was a very hard game against @entity104			0
we felt a bit tired , especially in the last 20 minutes			0
' it was difficult to run with @entity4 players because they were more fresh than us			2
but i am happy because everyone gave 100 per cent if not more			0
‘ we expected three points today but i think a draw is a fair result			0
we had some chances and they had some chances			0
