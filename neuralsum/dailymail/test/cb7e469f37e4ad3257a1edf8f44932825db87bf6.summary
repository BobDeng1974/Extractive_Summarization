in @entity12 and @entity13 , crime victims are waiting up to a third longer for a response			1
police response times in some areas have been increased by up to 50 per cent because of funding cuts @entity19 's shadow home secretary @entity18 , pictured , claimed the victims of crime were being put at risk according to figures released to the @entity19 under the @entity25 , across @entity26 and @entity27 , average 999 response times have increased by 17 percent			1
in @entity9 the average response time has increased from seven to 11 minutes			2
crime victims in @entity30 and @entity31 wait on average 14 minutes			0
shadow home secretary @entity18 said : ' 999 waits have gone up significantly for the most serious emergencies and that means victims are being put at risk			0
' this is the direct consequence of of @entity39 police cuts , yet now they want to go even further			1
