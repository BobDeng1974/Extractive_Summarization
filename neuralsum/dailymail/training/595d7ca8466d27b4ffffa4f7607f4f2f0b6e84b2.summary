@entity1 's chosen tipple from an award - winning brewery in @entity4 , @entity5 , has fallen foul of the @entity8 brigade - because its label features black - faced @entity11 dancers when an mp was asked to nominate a guest ale from his constituency to be served at a @entity16 bar , he was only too happy to help out			1
but @entity1 ’s chosen tipple from an award - winning brewery in @entity4 , @entity5 , has fallen foul of the @entity8 brigade – because its label features black - faced @entity11 dancers			1
the beer from the @entity20 was intended to celebrate the @entity21 from nearby @entity22 , who have been performing since 1857 with blacked faces to celebrate the area ’s mining heritage			1
but officials said the image may cause offence , so the beer will be served in the @entity30 sporting the @entity22 crest instead			2
parliamentary chiefs threw out the pale ale which had been specially crafted by a multi award - winning @entity35 brewery , saying the imagery ‘ may have caused offence			1
’ mps and local politicians slammed the decision , saying it ‘ favours political correctness over common sense ’			0
the @entity45 have hit out , saying their traditional black make - up and colourful turbans , red and white kilts and clogs , are a celebration of @entity5 ’s mining heritage			1
it comes days after @entity53 , son of @entity55 mp @entity54 , was embroiled in a @entity57 storm after posting a picture of himself with the morris dancing troupe			2
@entity60 , @entity45 secretary , called the decision ‘ a real sad shame ’			0
he said : ‘ i do n’t understand the furore			0
some people make caustic comments without understanding the tradition			0
‘ after recent comments made about us , i felt compelled to go back through our history , and there is no racial element whatsoever			0
there is no mention of race or ethnicity			0
‘ researchers from @entity78 have done the same , and come to the same conclusion			0
' @entity20 in @entity4 dropped the image of the @entity45 from the beer pump and replaced it with the @entity22 crest , which will accompany the ale in the @entity30			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ we thought of several names , but as the boundary dance was saved earlier this year , i thought it would be a fitting tribute to name the beer after the @entity45 , to celebrate their huge contribution to traditional dancing and their charity work across @entity35			2
a spokesman for the @entity16 said : ' the ale offered was not acceptable as the imagery proposed to be used in connection with sales may have caused offence ' ‘ @entity100 authorities did not feel that this would comply with the strict rules they have regarding the naming of guest beers and requested us to choose one of our alternative suggestions			1
‘ i ’m disappointed in the @entity109 decision			0
people who live in @entity111 obviously have no understanding about our @entity5 traditions			2
’ @entity117 , managing director of @entity20 , said : ‘ after @entity1 suggested we do a beer featuring the @entity45 , i made it up and we sent it down with him			2
‘ he came back to us and said they thought the picture of them could offend people , so we changed it to the @entity22 crest			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity16 said : ‘ the ale offered was not acceptable as the imagery proposed to be used in connection with sales may have caused offence			1
