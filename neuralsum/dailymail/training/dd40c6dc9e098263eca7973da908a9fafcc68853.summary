@entity0 scored an extremely contentious goal that appeared to come straight from a throw - in against @entity3 in the @entity4 on thursday night			1
the controversial incident resulted in the opener for the @entity8 side , who went on to win the @entity11 clash 2 - 1			2
it was officially credited to defender @entity13 ( wearing 22 ) , but it looked as though it was scored directly from the throw by @entity17			2
the ball was thrown in from @entity17 and @entity13 was credited with the goal although he appeared not to get a touch the ball travelled all the way through and beat the @entity3 keeper according to @entity25 's rules of the game 2014 - 15 : ' a goal can not be scored directly from a throw - in			1
' therefore , then , it should have been disallowed			0
but the @entity31 referee @entity30 must have seen something no one else did			0
the ball appeared to miss the head of defender @entity36 ( right ) but it sneaked all the way through to beat @entity3 goalkeeper @entity39			0
