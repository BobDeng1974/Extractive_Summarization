' if @entity31 fails to successfully adapt to these trends , they could threaten the long - term survival of the regime itself			0
' @entity1 have been spending money more openly , a sign that some forms of entrepreneurship are increasingly tolerated and that the state is easing some of its harsh controls over the economy			2
in recent months , consumption has become more conspicuous			0
' the variety and number of places for locals to spend money has really increased , ' said one regular visitor to @entity31 , declining to be identified			0
' people seem a lot more confident flashing the cash than they used to be			0
i 've seen people spend $ 500 on a phone with no hesitation , for example			0
' there is no sign , however , that the regime in nuclear - capable @entity1 is loosening its grip , looking to make substantial reforms or making any change in its unpredictable ways of dealing with the outside world			2
but along with rising incomes , more goods are available in the impoverished country , mostly on the black market but also in some state - controlled stores			0
@entity36 or ' notetel ' - the name is a uniquely @entity1 word combining ' notebook ' and ' television ' - are easily found on the black market for around 300 @entity43 yuan ( $ 48 ) , and are also available in some state shops and markets			1

@entity1 do not have access to the internet - those who can go online are limited to a state - run intranet , while the country 's 2.5 million mobile phone subscribers are not allowed to call outside the country			2
the notel comes from @entity43 , either smuggled or legally imported			2
@entity133 - young , a defector from the @entity1 , said he smuggled 18,000 @entity43 - made notel into the country last year			1
he said he ordered them directly from a factory in @entity138 that was likely still in production solely to satisfy the demands of the @entity1 market			2
the devices have lost their popularity in @entity43 over the years , but still sell well in the provinces bordering @entity1 , according to data on the @entity43 - based online shopping website @entity147			1

they can also be charged with a car battery - an essential piece of household equipment in electricity - scarce @entity1			0
legally - registered notel must be fixed to official state television and radio channels , according to the @entity173 , a @entity103 - based news organisation run by defectors			0
@entity133 , the defector , said the device 's multi-function nature makes it easier for users to get away with watching illegal material			0
' to avoid getting caught , people load a @entity1 dvd while watching @entity23 dramas on a usb stick , which can be pulled out , ' he said			1
' they then tell the authorities , who feel the heat from the notel to check whether or not it has been recently used , that they were watching @entity1 films '			2
@entity51 at the @entity53 organisation added : ' they are small enough to roll up in a blanket and hide in a wardrobe			0
they have become so popular because they are perfect for overcoming the twin barriers to foreign media consumption : surveillance and power outages			0
