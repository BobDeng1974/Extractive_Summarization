@entity1 faces its first dose of deflation for more than 50 years , the @entity0 declared yesterday			2
in a boost to family finances in the run - up to the general election , governor @entity4 said prices generally would probably fall in the coming months as the cost of essentials such as petrol and food come down			1
inflation has already fallen to 0.5 per cent following an oil price slump from $ 115 a barrel last summer to below $ 60 last night			0
@entity4 has said inflation rates could turn negative in 2015 mr @entity4 said the falling oil price was ‘ unambiguously good ’ for the economy , adding : ‘ it is more likely than not that headline inflation will turn negative at some point in the spring and will remain subdued for much of the rest of the year			1
’ an inflation rate below 0 per cent marks the onset of deflation , when the price of goods and services across the board falls			0
if prices do drop , then rising wages and the first bout of deflation since 1960 will push household incomes up at the fastest rate for more than a decade , according to the @entity0			2
it also opens the door to a further cut in interest rates , a move all but ruled out by the bank until now			0
@entity42 and @entity43 will hope that the feel - good factor generated by the boost to family budgets will translate into votes on polling day in may			2
however , mr @entity4 said that if falling prices become ‘ self - fulfilling ’ – and risk triggering a dangerous bout of the deflation seen in @entity52 – then interest rates could once again be cut			1
this would make mortgages even more affordable for borrowers already benefiting from some of the cheapest home loans in history			0
but it would be a blow to savers , who have lost out since rates hit a record low of 0.5 per cent in march 2009			1
the 0.5 per cent interest rates are already an historic low after soaring to 17 per cent in the 1980s mr @entity4 said if the @entity0 needed to tackle deflation , its monetary policy committee could cut interest rates and add to the £ 375billion of emergency funds it has already printed through quantitative easing			1
but he warned : ‘ negative inflation rates are unlikely to endure for very long			1
it is pretty clear that the most likely next move is an increase in interest rates			0
’ as he published the @entity0 ’s forecasts in its quarterly inflation report , mr @entity4 said any rate rise would be ‘ limited and gradual ’			1
investors do not expect the first rate rise since 2007 to come until april 2016			0
rates are not forecast to reach 1.5 per cent until 2019			0
chancellor of the exchequer @entity43 ( right ) will be hoping the feel - good factor generated by the boost to family budgets will translate into votes on polling day in may mr @entity4 said the prospect of a temporary dose of deflation ‘ masks stronger underlying dynamics ’ in the @entity1			1
the @entity0 estimated the economy grew by 3.1 per cent in 2014 – stronger than the 2.6 per cent rise reported by the @entity93 and the best performance since 2003			2
it predicted growth of 2.9 per cent till the end of 2016			0
incomes after tax are expected to grow by 3.5 per cent this year – the best performance since 2001 – leaving families feeling richer			0
mr @entity4 said : ‘ the combination of rising wages and falling energy and food prices will help household finances and boost the growth of real take - home pay this year			1
’ but a feel - good factor ahead of the election could hit @entity111 leader @entity110 , who has railed against a ‘ cost of living crisis ’			0

@entity4 said inflation ' likely ' to turn negative within months
as a result rates could be cut from the current record low of just 0.5 *%*
the @entity0 chief said falling prices would boost the economy
he said inflation is likely to stay at around zero between april and *october*
boost to family finances in run - up to the @entity131
but the @entity0 warned it is still more likely that rates will rise over time
