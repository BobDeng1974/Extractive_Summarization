@entity0 wants @entity2 ’s player of the year @entity1 to join @entity3 as part of @entity6 ’s plans to conquer @entity7			1
the @entity6 coach went public on his desire to sign @entity1 as his club prepared to announce the £ 50million signing of @entity2 ’s disaffected @entity13 international central defender , @entity3			1
@entity2 also have a decision to make on @entity1 ( right ) after @entity0 admitted that he wanted to sign the winger			1
‘ we can discuss all of the systems , or a player ’s individual or collective qualities			0
‘ but a player who can eliminate three , four players at any time in a game is something else			0
‘ we do not know what to expect with these players			0
‘ we know we want plan a. but of course there is a plan b if he does n’t come			0
there is also a plan @entity43 ’ with such seemingly unlimited funding , @entity0 is under pressure to win the @entity46 for the first time in the club ’s history next season after dominating the @entity52 league again last campaign			1
@entity6 ’s medical team flew overnight to @entity13 ’s @entity56 training camp where @entity3 passed a medical assessment to join the @entity20 champions			1
the £ 50m fee was agreed with @entity2 and generous personal terms were successfully negotiated with the player			0
the sale of @entity3 , which was revealed by @entity63 in later editions yesterday , is a massive gamble by @entity2 manager @entity66 as he attempts to build a team that can wrestle the @entity69 title from @entity71 next season			2
following suit ? hazard ( right ) could be next to leave @entity2 for @entity6 after @entity3 ( left ) underwent a medical @entity75 : selling @entity3 , @entity76 's favourite player , is a major risk for @entity66 @entity3 is @entity2 owner @entity76 ’s favourite player and the decision to sell represents a fascinating move by @entity66 after he convinced the board they must cash in			1
@entity6 , owned by the @entity83 , certainly have the finances to conclude a shock move for hazard too , and @entity0 is prepared to pay another £ 50million to lure the @entity88 international away from @entity89			2

@entity2 have released veteran striker @entity96 , but are still hopeful of persuading @entity98 midfielder @entity97 to stay at the club			0
@entity66 will be planning to use the @entity3 cash to bring a star striker to the club with @entity103 ’s @entity102 his main target .			0

@entity6 boss @entity0 says he wants @entity2 's @entity107 star
@entity3 will sign for @entity52 champions after a medical in @entity13
@entity0 may be *constrained* by @entity113 regulations , but wants @entity1 to boost chances of @entity46 success
