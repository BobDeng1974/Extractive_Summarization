and nor , it seems , can his players			0
‘ the unbeaten run is on our minds , ’ admitted @entity28			1
‘ but the team just starts again every time and plays for a win , and if we win or if we draw it is ok			2
what is important is that we do n’t lose			0

so you start confidently , but we need to continue like this			0

all the players want to defend for the team , even the attacking players , even me			0
we are very strong and it ’s important			0
’ you could , though , forgive @entity7 for briefly turning his mind to an undefeated campaign			2
he is n’t new to success but such an achievement would cement his place — if it is n’t already — as one of the greatest managers in history			0
his squad is certainly strong enough to make a decent fist of it , too			0
question marks over how the @entity130 would deal without the suspended @entity131 against @entity26 were emphatically answered by @entity132 who scored one and made another goal in the 3 - 0 win			2
it prompted @entity7 to reveal he is keen for the striker to continue playing for the club past his current deal that expires in the summer			2
