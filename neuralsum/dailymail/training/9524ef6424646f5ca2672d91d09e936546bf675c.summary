by @entity0 created 8:06 pm on 29th september 2011 it was the book the founder of @entity3 said was published to ' screw ' him for cash but despite huge publicity surrounding its release it has become a sales flop			1
@entity10 's unauthorised autobiography came out last week but just 644 copies were sold in its first three days in the shops			2
despite containing the explosive admission by mr @entity10 that he slept with the two women accusing him of @entity16 ( less serious crime ) ' rape ' and sexual molestation respectively , it sat at a lowly 537th in the @entity21 book chart yesterday			1
memoir : the book is being published by @entity24 against @entity10 's wishes and has sold less than 700 copies in three days in 2010 mr @entity10 's @entity3 website catapulted him to world stardom after he published more than 250,000 @entity30 diplomatic cables , thousands of which were top secret			1
but his reputation was hit after the @entity35 government attempted to extradite the @entity36 on suspicion of sexual crimes , which he is still fighting			0
in this new book , which he was paid £ 500,000 to be involved in , he claims the women who say they were sexually assaulted did so because they are either part of the @entity30 conspiracy or because he failed to return their calls			0
' i did not rape those women and can not imagine anything that happened between us that would make them think so , except malice after the fact , a joint plan to entrap me , or a terrible misunderstanding that was stoked up between them , ' he said			2
support : protesters at one of @entity10 's extradition hearings in @entity57 , as many back his publication of government documents ' i may be a chauvinist pig or some sort but i am no rapist , and only a distorted version of sexual politics could attempt to turn me into one			1
they both had sex with me willingly and were happy to hang out with me afterwards			0
' amongst other sensational claims @entity10 also says a contact in a @entity69 intelligence agency told him that the @entity30 government were considering planting drugs and child pornography or embroiling him ' in allegations of immoral conduct ' to get him			2
however , after reading the book 's first draft , written by @entity77 , the 40 - year - old tried to prevent its publication saying he had come to the conclusion that ‘ all memoir is prostitution ’			2
controversy : mr @entity10 claims the rape accusations made against him are part of a conspiracy between the @entity30 government and the two women @entity10 claimed they were ' screwing people over to make a buck ' and the book is ' entirely uncorrected or fact - checked by me '			1
but @entity95 publishers @entity24 decided to push ahead and more than 70,000 copies of the now unauthorised autobiography were supplied to bookshops last week			0
but despite the huge interest in its release it has sold in relatively small numbers			0
' it was only the 50th bestselling hardback non-fiction book of the week , and only the 537th bestselling book overall , sitting directly behind @entity105 's @entity104 ( @entity106 ) and @entity107 ( @entity108 ) , a £ 6.99 collection of three short stories featuring " three of her sexiest , most intense @entity113 heroes and glamorous heroines " , ' @entity115 , charts editor at the @entity117 said			1
but despite the poor sales the publisher maintains they are not disappointed with the sales			0
@entity24 publishing director @entity121 told the @entity117 that is was ' a marathon and not a sprint ' , and they had ' never made any big predictions about the sales of the @entity10 book – particularly on the first three days of sale '			1
' there was no build - up for the trade , the media or with the reading public			0
but we 're proud of the way we handled what has been a difficult and unusual launch , and we are extremely proud of the book , ' he said .			0

it sat at 537 in the @entity21 book chart yesterday , with *similar* sales as a @entity108 set of short stories
@entity10 maintains the book was published entirely without his *permission* after he tried to block its release
this article was *amended* on 8 march . an earlier version stated that mr @entity10 faced ‘ two allegations of rape ’ . in fact , there is one allegation of @entity16 ( less serious crime ) ' rape ' , the other being of sexual molestation .
