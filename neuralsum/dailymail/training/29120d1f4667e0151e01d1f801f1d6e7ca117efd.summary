by @entity0 published : 20:08 est , 27 october 2012 updated : 20:10 est , 27 october 2012 police forces across @entity2 are being forced to deal with petty squabbles on @entity4 , @entity5 and other social network sites every day when they could be tackling more serious crimes			1
officers say they are wasting valuable time and resources tackling internet users directing abuse at each other			0
in most cases , police simply tell victims to delete their tormentors from their networks , but the @entity19 says a ‘ few dozen ’ more serious incidents have led to court , with the figure growing rapidly in recent months			1
internet trolls made sick comments about pop singer @entity26 ’s baby boy within hours of his birth , and @entity28 and diving partner @entity29 were called ‘ @entity36 ’ on twitter by @entity32 footballer @entity31 , who was arrested but escaped prosecution because the duo did not press charges new figures obtained by @entity38 show that at least three arrests are being made every day for sending offensive messages via phones and computers , including people harassing ex-partners by text message and making hoax threats as well as comments on social media			1
an officer from @entity50 who asked not to be named said : ‘ i dread to think how many hours are spent on @entity4 jobs			0
if you do n’t do at least one a day it ’s been a very quiet day			1
’ he told how one man repeatedly called to claim that his ex-girlfriend was setting up fake accounts pretending to be him on @entity4 , which has 900 million members worldwide			0
attacked : teenager @entity59 was attacked by 3,000 trolls from across the world and called a ¿ whore ¿ and a ¿ disgrace to women and her family ¿ after she posted a mildly titillating picture of herself on @entity4			0
some users said she deserved to die			0
when officers told the man to simply stop using @entity4 , he replied : ‘ but then i ca n’t see what they are saying about me			0
’ a young woman told police in @entity75 she had received death threats on @entity4			1
but when officers investigated , they found she had actually threatened to spread malicious rumours about another woman , who had replied : ‘ i hope you die then			0
’ an officer from the @entity83 told how he had advised someone complaining of @entity4 abuse to ‘ unfriend ’ their abuser , only to be told : ‘ but i wo n’t have as many friends			0
’ others expected police to have a ‘ magic wand ’ allowing them to access all @entity4 accounts and find out who was behind offensive messages			2
an officer from @entity96 said : ‘ you will always have one or two serious incidents of harassment and bullying on @entity4 and the like but for the most part it ’s petty stuff			0
it takes up a lot of time and the normal result is advice from us to all parties to grow up			2
’ @entity111 , vice-chairman of the @entity112 , said : ‘ we have concerns that we do n’t have the resources to police everything that ’s said on the internet			2
we ca n’t have people getting upset in a one - off situation and involving the police			1
i do think this could be the thin end of the wedge			0
if we show too much willingness and get involved in every squabble , we ’re setting ourselves up to keep doing this because it will be expected			2
’ he said it was right for police to investigate cases involving homophobia or racism , but added : ‘ we should n’t be dealing with individual squabbles			1
’ storm after @entity137 retweets : @entity138 and @entity140 defender @entity139 retweeted a message from a fan that referred to @entity144 s @entity143 as a ¿ choc ice ¿ ¿ a derogatory term meaning a person is black on the outside and white on the inside the laws most commonly used to prosecute anyone who posts offensive material online , or ‘ trolls ’ who goad public figures and victims ’ relatives , make it illegal to send a grossly offensive or obscene message using an electronic network , and apply even if it is sent privately to only one person or just repeats what another has said			1
statistics from 22 out of the 43 police forces in @entity140 and @entity166 show there were at least 4,098 arrests under the relevant laws between the start of 2009 and the middle of 2012 , averaging three a day			1
more than 2,000 people were either charged or given an out - of - court fine or caution .			2

statistics from 22 out of the 43 police forces in @entity140 and @entity166 show arrests are averaging three a day
police say in most cases people need to ' grow up '
