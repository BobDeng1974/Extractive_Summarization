' this is far from over			0
' @entity71 's rise in the race to succeed mayor @entity17 was as sudden as it was unexpected			2
not even two months ago , he was an afterthought in the campaign but surged in part thanks to an ad blitz that centered on his interracial family , his headline - grabbing arrest while protesting the possible closure of a @entity33 hospital and the defection of @entity26 's former supporters in the wake of another sexting scandal			1

city council speaker and @entity6 @entity9 mayoral hopeful @entity50 , greets supporter @entity146 at a campaign stop on primary election day in @entity6 @entity17 , the businessman @entity15 - turned - independent , is completing his third term			1

@entity105 was the front - runner for much of the year , boasting the biggest campaign war chest and strong establishment backing			0
