it 's based on number of followers and tweets per day			0
according to @entity34 's formula , @entity30 , a nonstop tweeter , is due a whopping $ 20,916,384 while president @entity46 is owed just over $ 5million			1
@entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity37 are each owed several million for their devotion to the site			1
@entity29 recently overtook @entity30 as the most followed person on @entity0			1
the 29 - year - old star now has 46,903,486 subscribers			0
according to @entity10 's equation , @entity0 owes her over $ 4million by dividing a person 's tweets by the number of days they have had a @entity0 account and then multiplying that amount by the number of followers , @entity34 has determined how many potential eyeballs per day a @entity79 generates			1
that number is then multiplied by 25 per cent			0
( the magazine cited a study that ' suggests that around three - quarters of tweets are ignored			0
to estimate a user â€™s current number of daily readers , ( @entity34 ) reduce the potential audience by 75 %			0

@entity93 , ranked no. 10 on the tracking site @entity95 , would have walked away with $ 1,055,074			0
in an interesting twist , having a higher number of followers than someone else does not automatically mean a bigger potential pay - out			0
for example , miss @entity91 has about 20million more followers that @entity64 , but because he fires off more messages per day than her , he has nearly 30million more potential eyeballs per day , thus making him ( in theory ) $ 2,178,695 richer			2
@entity107 president @entity46 has 39.5million followers			1
according to @entity10 , @entity0 owes him just over $ 5million to determine the amount each eyeball is worth per day , the magazine took @entity0 's $ 24.9billion value and divided it by the companies ' estimated 200billion per day tweet delivery service , which equals 12.45 cents			1
it is important to point out that those figures are based solely on @entity10 's equation , and that the value of the social media giant reflects not its current user base , but rather its potential to grow			0
