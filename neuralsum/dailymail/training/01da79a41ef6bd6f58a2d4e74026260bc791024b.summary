an experimental drug has been found to lift depression in just over an hour in people who have n't responded to other treatments			1
the findings open up the prospect of developing a new fast - working type of anti-depressant			2
in a new study , a third of participants responded to the treatment within one hour and 20 minutes , seeing at least a 50 per cent reduction in their symptoms compared to a 15 per cent reduction in those who took a placebo			1
living in a fog : sufferers of depression report feeling emotionally numb this was significant as these patients had failed to improve in seven past antidepressant trials			0
however , while their were minimal side - effects the dramatic improvements were short - lived with patients finding relief for an average of just half an hour			1
the current range of treatments work through the brain 's serotonin system , building up levels of this ' happy ' hormone over a period of weeks			1
this can cause great distress to severely depressed patients as many are at high risk of suicide			0
however , the latest drug called @entity42 , acts by preventing the binding of a brain chemical called glutamate to nerve cells			2
it acts in a similar way to the @entity49 drug ketamine , but without the serious side - effects such as hallucinations			1
drug pioneer : dr @entity53 , who has also studied anti-depressive effects of ketamine scientists at the @entity57 , who conducted the study , said this could be because the new drug does n't block glutamate binding as completely as ketamine			1
in the trial half of the 22 patients received the drug through an iv drip , while the other half took a placebo			2
all of them completed a survey assessing their depressive state immediately after taking the drug and a few days after treatment			0
the two groups then switched the agent they took and went through the same assessment			0
the patients reported only minor side effects , such as dizziness and nausea , when taking @entity42 , which were not significantly different from those experienced with the placebo			2
research leader dr @entity53 , said : ' our findings serve as a proof of concept that we can tap into an important component of the glutamate pathway to develop a new generation of safe , rapid - acting practical treatments for depression			0
' the team reported their results online in the journal @entity96			0
they now want to do further trials , testing whether repeated infusions a few times per week or higher doses might produce longer - lasting results .			0

drug worked within an hour and 20 minutes - current anti-depressants take weeks to have an impact
it works in a similar way to the @entity49 drug ketamine but without causing serious side - effects
however , the effects may be short - lived
