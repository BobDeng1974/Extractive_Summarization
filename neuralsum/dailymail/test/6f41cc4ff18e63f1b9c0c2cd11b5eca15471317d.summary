@entity1 manager @entity0 is out to claim a season - first against @entity3 on saturday - pick up some points after an international break			1
@entity7 's men have enjoyed an excellent campaign by being in the top 10 all season and are currently in eighth place with the club 's best @entity12 points total in sight			1
@entity1 have eight more games to collect the five points needed to beat the 47 - point mark posted in their inaugural @entity12 campaign in 2011 - 12			1
@entity0 is out to claim a season - first against @entity3 by picking up a point after an international break the @entity1 boss gestures towards his striker @entity23 during a training session this week it is a campaign which has exceeded so many expectations but @entity1 have yet to pick up a point after an international break this term , although in mitigation those have been away games at @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
' international breaks are never easy because it does disrupt your preparations but we have to put that right on saturday , ' @entity0 said ahead of @entity3 's visit to the @entity42			1
' a lot of the players come back later on in the week and you might get only two or three days preparation with some of them			0
' but these are the decisions you have to make , you assess them when they come back and see where they are physically and mentally			0
' you see how well they did in those games , make sure there 's nothing from that and then select your side			2
' but i do n't read too much into those games we 've had after the international break because we 've been unlucky in some of them			1
' @entity65 ( right ) marked by @entity66 during the session as @entity1 prepare for @entity3 @entity1 captain @entity68 ( centre ) in training as they look to end their post-international break duck @entity1 are seeking a double over relegation - troubled @entity3 after winning 1 - 0 at the @entity74 just before @entity75			2
but @entity0 says games between the two clubs have always been tight affairs and he is not expecting anything different this time			2
' i watched their last game against @entity32 and thought they performed extremely well and were unlucky to lose , ' @entity0 said			2
' we 've always had close games with @entity3			0
it 's a tough physical game with them but they have got quality to hurt us if we 're not on our game			0
' this is it , the business end of the season and everyone 's fighting for their own reasons			0
' @entity3 are trying to stay away from danger at the bottom of the table , they will be very determined and we have to be prepared for that			0
' but we 're in good form at the moment and we 're trying to push on and focus on our own agenda			0
