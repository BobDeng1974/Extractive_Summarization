@entity2 @entity1 could be given a peerage in a bid to keep him in his @entity6 post in a second @entity7 , it emerged today			0
the high - flyer and close ally of @entity10 , who has won praise as @entity12 ’s second - in - command , is on course to lose his seat to the @entity17 nationalists			1
he would be one of the highest - profile casualties of the @entity20 surge which is set to take the seats of many of @entity17 40 @entity23 and 11 @entity24 on may 7			1
other party stalwarts likely to be ennobled after the election are former leaders @entity40 who may lose his seat of @entity43 , and sir @entity44 who is standing down			1
the @entity2 believe in ultimately tearing up the current @entity37 and making it a fully elected chamber			1
their interim plan is to cut the number of peers to 450			2
however while they wait for support from other parties for @entity53 , they are likely to continue adding to the ranks of their 99 appointed and four hereditary @entity2 peers			0
@entity10 , pictured in @entity56 today , has claimed the @entity2 would serve as the ‘ heart ’ of a @entity59 - led government , opposing welfare cuts , or the ‘ brains ’ of a @entity23 one – reining in borrowing if made a peer , mr @entity1 could serve as a minister in a second coalition particularly with the @entity59 who he has worked closely with as a member of the ‘ quad ’ which approved coalition policy			1
according to party rules , a coalition with either the @entity59 or @entity23 would have to be voted on by @entity2 members , who may oppose it , in the belief that the party needs a spell in opposition			0
but schools minister @entity78 made clear last week that many of the frontbench are keen for another term , saying the party still have an ‘ appetite for power ’			0
a spokesman for mr @entity1 refused to rule out that he would ever take a peerage , but said no such plans were under consideration and that he believed he would retain his seat			2
the @entity6 chief , who is said to have ambitions for the party leadership , is likely to have no difficulty finding a role in the @entity95 or a global financial institution			2
if a second coalition were formed , @entity10 has claimed the @entity2 would serve as the ‘ heart ’ of a @entity59 - led government , opposing welfare cuts , or the ‘ brains ’ of a @entity23 one – reining in borrowing			1
mr @entity10 has appeared in public several times in recent weeks to make economic announcement with @entity78 , who held the @entity6 job before mr @entity1 mr @entity1 has attacked the @entity107 ’ plans to slash £ 12billion from the welfare bill as a ‘ dangerous deceit ’ , and accused them of trying to ‘ balance the books on the backs of the working poor			1
’ he said last week : ‘ we said we will talk first to whichever party has strongest mandate from the electorate			0
it is for the electorate to decide who has the strongest mandate , who has the most seats in parliament			0
that is who we talk to first			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity1 said the plan for a peerage was ‘ complete , total , utter nonsense ’			2
he said : ‘ @entity1 is focused on one thing which is retaining his seat and he ’s working very hard to do that			0
it ’s obviously a fight but he will do miles better than these wretched polls suggest			1
’ a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ this is not on our radar			0
@entity40 is not going to lose his seat and @entity1 is not going to lose his seat , we ’ve seen the figures			1
they are fighting to get back into @entity138 and we believe they will be successful so this is not relevant			0

plan *hatched* for chief secretary to the treasury to go to @entity37
polls suggest he is on course to lose his seat to the @entity17 nationalists
but he is a close ally of @entity10 and worked well with @entity12
