by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 11 november 2012 updated : 02:59 est , 12 november 2012 risks : common allergy medicines have been found to cause memory and concentration problems in older people , researchers say			1
picture posed by model allergy pills taken by thousands of @entity10 could be causing memory problems , researchers claim			1
common treatments including @entity13 for hayfever have been found to increase forgetfulness and concentration difficulties in pensioners			2
@entity19 scientists have also found a link with popular sleeping pills and antidepressants			1
they are now urging doctors to consider whether their patients should really be taking these medications in light of the possible side - effects			0
although the researchers did not look at the risk of dementia , there is some evidence having mild memory problems makes you far more susceptible to the devastating illness			2
academics from @entity37 in @entity19 looked at 68 studies which had examined the potential health risks of certain medications			1
they found that treatments for allergies , insomnia , depression and for overactive bladders were all linked to memory and concentration problems			1
these drugs include @entity13 , for hayfever , benzodiazepines such as the sleeping pills diazepam and temazepam and the antidepressant amitriptyline			1
lead researcher dr @entity54 warned that the potential effects of such drugs on memory problems , or cognitive decline , is ‘ undervalued			1
’ she said : ‘ patients need this information so that they are more comfortable talking to their doctors and pharmacists about safer pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment options			0
‘ each individual has a right to make an informed choice based on preference and a thorough understanding of the effects the medications may have on their memory and function			2
’ the study , published in the journal @entity75 and aging , concluded : ‘ patients are increasingly concerned with perceived memory and attention deficits that may signal early dementia			2
‘ the impact of medications on cognitive function and their ability to affect the results of neuropsychological test scores during the clinical assessment of memory complaints is undervalued			0
recall : having mild memory problems can make elderly people more susceptible to dementia , evidence suggests ‘ there is a consistent body of evidence suggesting that drug - induced mild cognitive impairment can occur with episodic use of medications for insomnia , anxiety or allergy symptoms			1
’ experts think the drugs interfere with chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters , which are responsible for passing on messages			0
this may result in forgetfulness , concentration problems and there is some evidence it leads to dementia			0
earlier this year @entity116 researchers found that benzodiazepines increased the risk of developing the devastating illness by up to 50 per cent			0
most antihistamine tablets are sold over the counter and there are no figures for the numbers of patients currently using them			0
but as many as 15 million @entity10 suffer from some form of allergy in their lives , including hayfever , although not all will seek treatment			0
figures also show that around 1.5 million are on sleeping pills and 6 million on antidepressants .			0

@entity19 scientists say allergy pills can hit memory of older people
drugs for depression and insomnia also linked to concentration loss
