by @entity0 parents thinking of buying land in @entity4 to pass down to future generations should purchase something metres above sea level to account for climate change , a scientist has warned			0
a recent study by @entity10 , from the @entity12 's @entity11 , has suggested sea levels may rise faster than previously estimated because climate models have failed to account for the effects of strong winds in @entity17			1
glaciers on the @entity20 west coast may have begun melting and could raise sea levels by three metres over 200 - 500 years , according to dr @entity10			1
' it 's the first time that i looked at my science and thought , " @entity38 , that is very concerning " ! changes to winds have already been linked to southern @entity4 's drying climate but now it appears they may also have a profound impact on warming ocean temperatures under the ice shelves along the @entity20 coastline			2
the study by @entity49 has suggested sea levels may rise faster than previously estimated because climate models have failed to account for the effects of strong winds in @entity17 ' when we first saw the results it was quite a shock			2
it was one of the few cases where i hoped the science was wrong , ' dr @entity10 said			0
when researchers included projected @entity20 wind shifts in a detailed global ocean model , they found water up to 4 ° c warmer than current temperatures at the base of the @entity20 ice shelves			1
recent estimates suggest the @entity20 ice sheet alone could contribute 3.3 metres to long - term global sea level rise			0
glaciers on the @entity20 west coast may have begun melting and could raise sea levels by three metres over 200 - 500 years , according to dr @entity10 prior to the research by @entity49 and scientists at the @entity12 and the @entity83 , most sea level rise studies focused on the rate of ice shelf melting due to the general warming of the ocean over large areas			1
using super computers at @entity4 's @entity86 the researchers were able to examine the impacts of changing winds on currents down to 700m around the coastline in greater detail than ever before .			0

@entity10 from the @entity12 says sea levels may rise faster than estimated due to strong winds in @entity17
melting @entity20 glaciers could raise sea levels by 3 metres over 200 years
new research found water up to 4 ° c warmer than current temperatures at base of ice shelves
dr @entity10 said it was a rare case where he hoped science was wrong
