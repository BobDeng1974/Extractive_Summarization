by @entity0 last updated at 1:12 pm on 30th december 2011 an aggressive species of crayfish which has been invading @entity4 's waterways is being tracked with radio transmitters in a bid to understand why they move so quickly - and help control their advance			2
the @entity11 predators have colonised the @entity12 near @entity13 , moving at more than 500m per month			1
the crayfish have now taken over 17km of the river			2
the @entity16 said virile crayfish , which are non-native , prey on native wildlife and spread crayfish plague , a disease deadly to native white - clawed crayfish			1
it is believed that virile crayfish arrived in the @entity25 after an aquarium owner released them into an east @entity29 pond			0
the predatory @entity11 crayfish are believed to have escaped an aquarium in @entity29 before colonising a river			1
now they are being fitted with radio transmitters the @entity16 has fitted small radio transmitters on the backs of the unwelcome guests , with preliminary results showing that virile crayfish are moving upstream at a rate of 500 metres ( 1,640ft ) per month			2
this is substantially faster than their cousin , the signal crayfish , which is also non-native			0
the @entity25 's only native crayfish , the white clawed crayfish , was wiped out along the @entity12 following the invasion of the signal crayfish in the 1980s and the associated spread of crayfish plague			1
@entity50 , environmental monitoring officer at the @entity16 , said : ' whilst rivers in @entity4 and @entity52 are cleaner than they have been for decades , there is still a lot to be done in order to return them to full health			0
this includes the control of invasive species like virile crayfish			0
' i fought the claw and the claw won : @entity64 handout photo of @entity66 , @entity67 with a virile ( right ) and signal crayfish ( left ) ' by tracking the colonisation of the @entity12 by virile crayfish , we will better understand how this species impacts the environment and our native wildlife			1
' ' however , one of the most important ways to protect our wildlife is to stop the spread of non-native invasive species			2
we 're appealing to the public not to release unwanted pets into the wild			0
' anyone who catches a crayfish must follow strict guidelines on how to handle them in order to prevent their spread and the transmission of crayfish plague			1
the rise of invasive species is a major challenge in meeting tough new @entity95 targets on the ecology of rivers and lakes			0
they cost the @entity25 economy an estimated Â£ 1.7 billion every year , according to the @entity16 .			0

predatory @entity11 crayfish take over river in @entity13
