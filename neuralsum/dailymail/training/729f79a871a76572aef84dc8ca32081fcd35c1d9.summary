a civil liberties campaigner decided to turn the tables on a @entity3 state sheriff by pulling him over for patrolling in uniform in an unmarked car and issued him a stern warning			1
@entity7 , a former candidate for the @entity8 , videoed the entire incident after he caught the officer on saturday driving through @entity11			1
flagging the patrolling officer down , @entity7 asks the man , who identifies himself as @entity14 of the @entity15 , if he is working undercover or on patrol			1
scroll down for @entity17 you what ? deputy sheriff @entity14 initially entertains @entity7 's intervention and listens as he upholds the law hmmmm ... ...			1
. the attitude of the deputy changes as @entity7 explains that he has fallen foul of the law prove it : @entity7 makes the officer produce his official identification as he explains to him the 1937 @entity3 state law staggered : the officer is mildly taken aback when @entity7 explains that he will not be reporting him and is letting him off with a warning the unsuspecting @entity14 makes the straightforward admission he is driving on patrol , which @entity7 jumps on and tells the deputy that he is breaking the law			1
indeed , he explains to @entity35 that in @entity3 , it is against the law for a non-state officer to work patrols in unmarked vehicles and subsequently any deputy in one could be arrested			1
the deputy then stares at @entity42 and tries to regain the upper hand by telling him , ' this is not a game			0
' unfazed , @entity7 shoots back calmly , ' you are right , this is n't a game , it is the law			2
' the officer then realizes that because he is being videoed it is best to follow through with @entity7 's requests and produces his id when asked by the civil rights champion			2
incredibly , after checking the deputy 's @entity53 , @entity7 tells him that he is lucky - because in this case he will only give him a warning and tells him to return to his station and review the law			0
result : @entity7 has been a thorn in the side of law enforcement officers for years and has even run for congress in the past @entity7 tells the officer that police in uniform on patrol need to be in marked cars for safety reasons			2
he then tells the officer that the public need to know who is representing the law and who is not			0
the directive was first introduced in @entity3 in 1937 and states that ' vehicle marking exemption for vehicles used by sheriffs , local police and local peace officers is continued but is limited to vehicles used for undercover or confidential investigative purposes ‚Äù and was implemented to provide better public visibility of government owned vehicles			0
' @entity7 has a history of interfering in the day to day activities of law enforcement officers in a bid to keep them honest			0
he claims his actions are justifiable because he is acting to ' hold police and other state authorities accountable ' .			0
