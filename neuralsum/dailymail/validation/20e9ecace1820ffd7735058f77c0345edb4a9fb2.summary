@entity0 today took a chance to boast about healthcare reform to a group of six - year - old girls - though admitted that @entity5 is not as impressive as a device for turning the pages of a book			1
the president , put on the spot by a crowd of @entity12 to name something he 'd come up with to match their device , plumped for his much - touted healthcare reforms			1
@entity0 , who was touring exhibits at the annual @entity18 , made the jokey exchange before pledging $ 240million in federal dollars to boost the study of science and technology			1
the girls , all aged six , are members of a girl scout troop in @entity45 , @entity46 , and developed their contraption to help those who are paralyzed or arthritic read more easily			1
when the commander - in - chief asked how they had come up with the device , one answered that ' a brain - storming session ' was the answer , then asked whether he had any to his name			1
@entity0 conceded : ' i have had a couple of brain - storming sessions , but i did n't come up with anything this good			1
' announcement : @entity0 also used the annual fair , held at the @entity18 , to announce $ 240million of funding for science , technology engineering and math whizzes and bangs : the commander - in - @entity67 marveled at the devices on display , including this robot built by @entity71 ( left ) and @entity72 ( center ) from @entity74 , @entity75 ' see , you guys are already better brain - stormers than i am			1
' the persistent @entity80 followed up her question , asking : ' what did you come up with ? ' he replied : ' i mean , i came up with things like , you know , health care			1
' it turned out ok , but it started off with some prototypes			0
' his flagship health legislation is five years old today			1
the girls were among 35 young science fair winners who came to the @entity18 to show off their inventions , which ranged from spinal implants to computer password technology			2
favorites : @entity0 lingered at the display by the so - called ' supergirl ' team , who had made their invention partly out of @entity38 learning : @entity103 , from @entity104 , @entity105 , shows @entity0 how to make waves to illustrate her solution to generate electricity from docks bobbing in the water he later announced the hefty new government investment into so - called @entity113 subjects , an acronym for science , technology , engineering and math. the pledges the president announced include a $ 150million philanthropic effort to encourage promising early - career scientists to stay on track and a $ 90million campaign to expand @entity113 opportunities to underrepresented youth , such as minorities and girls			1
altogether , the new @entity113 commitments have brought total financial and material support for these programs to $ 1billion			2
' it 's not enough for our country just to be proud of you			0
we 've got to support you , ' @entity0 said later , addressing students and scientists in the @entity139			0
talking it up : the president said that his educate to innovate strategy is a way to ' support ' science rather than just be ' proud ' of it more than 100 colleges and universities have committed to training 20,000 engineers , and a coalition of @entity152 has promised to expand high - quality stem education programs to an additional 1.5million students this year			2
@entity0 launched ' educate to innovate ' , his effort to encourage the study of science , technology , engineering and math , in 2009			2
@entity0 said the fair is one of the most fun events held annually at the @entity18			0
he said : ' every year i walk out smarter than when i walked in '			0
another one to try out : @entity0 is pictured here testing a modified wheelchair made by @entity166 , 16 , of @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 , 16 , of @entity170 , who is originally from @entity172 @entity0 's science adviser , @entity173 , joined the president during the tour of the displays , introducing himself to the young inventors and researches			2
he said : ' @entity180 - these kids are so much more advanced than when i was in school			0
' at each of the 12 display stations , @entity0 quizzed the participants about their projects			0
at one , @entity187 , a 17 - year - old from @entity188 , @entity75 , described the special algorithm she had devised to identify other medical applications for existing drugs			0
@entity0 turned to the group of reporters and photographers trailing him			0
' just saying , i do n't know what you all have been doing - this is what she 's been doing			0

president was put on the spot to name an achievement by @entity80 troop
inventors , from @entity45 , @entity46 , *wanted* to know what he 'd brain - stormed
he replied : ' i came up with things like , you know , health care '
@entity5 *insurance* reform laws are five years old today
he later announced $ 240million pledge to boost study of science and tech
