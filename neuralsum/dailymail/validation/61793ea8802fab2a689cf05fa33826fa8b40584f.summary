@entity0 is living proof there is life after @entity4			1
@entity6 ’s manager left the world ’s wealthiest football club at the age of 32 and , like the cliché says , feared the only way was down			1
within three years , he was captain of @entity12 , champions of @entity13			1
the odds of @entity15 mirroring that achievement at @entity17 are long			1
yet @entity0 casts a glance at one of his star midfielders now and sees a rejuvenated figure			1
free of the ulcerative colitis which cast a long shadow over his @entity25 career , @entity15 is playing football again			1
his performances at the @entity28 have drawn critical acclaim			2
@entity6 manager @entity0 has praised @entity15 for leaving @entity4 @entity0 has revealed he is yet to decide if @entity15 ( centre ) will lead @entity6 in their upcoming fixtures @entity6 manager @entity0 says he does n't know who will be his captain for the upcoming fixtures there can be no denying that having a @entity4 player as captain was a boon to @entity42 morale			1
yet @entity0 knew when the time was right to seek fresh pastures			1
@entity15 , he believes , is thriving in his new environment			1
‘ you can , when you leave @entity4 , go on and create a new career for yourself , ’ said the @entity6 boss as he prepared for the twin challenges of @entity48 and @entity49			1
‘ some find it difficult , some get on with it and create a new career			2
that ’s what @entity15 is doing now			1
‘ @entity59 , apart from being a good coach , knows good players			2
getting good people around you is the secret			2
‘ i got on all right after i left @entity4			1
i had good players around me and good people			2
‘ @entity68 players just like playing football			2
@entity15 has got a hunger and a pride			1
it ’s not easy to leave @entity4			1
it ’s one of the best clubs in the world , if not the best			2
‘ so there ’s a point when you think , “ is this it ? ” but then you realise there ’s more to life and your career can continue			2
there is another world out there			2
’ @entity4 was all @entity15 had known			1
@entity0 ( far right , pictured with @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 ) left @entity4 to join @entity12 @entity87 captain @entity86 has been @entity6 skipper in the absence of @entity17 skipper @entity15 born in @entity89 , he signed for sir @entity90 in 2003 and spent 12 years at the club			1
@entity87 tried to bring him back to his native land before the opportunity to remain in the @entity94 proved irresistible			0
in contrast with his latter years at @entity4 , when first - team appearances were bitty and sporadic , @entity15 has played almost every game since signing for @entity59 in the january window			1
‘ i think he ’s happier in himself , which is understandable , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he has played 10 or 15 games this season and is enjoying life			0
‘ he has answered a few questions by playing all those games			0
i saw him a couple of weeks ago at @entity105 and he was terrific , even though @entity17 lost			0
‘ i ’ve been lucky during his absence that i ’ve got @entity86 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			1
in the @entity111 game , @entity109 was as good as anyone in there			0
we have good players in midfield			0
‘ there is a physical and mental side to it for @entity15 but he has dealt with that			1
he has decided what his career is and that it ’s not with @entity4 any more			1
he does n’t want to be a sub , he wanted to do something about it			0
’ @entity15 has played seven games for @entity17 since joining the @entity127 outfit on february 2 @entity15 decided to leave @entity4 after struggling to break into @entity129 's first team plans capped 66 times , @entity15 has been captain of the national team for most of that time			1
it ’s far from clear he will be this time , with @entity87 ’s @entity86 claiming the armband in recent games			1
@entity0 says he has yet to decide his team to face @entity48 , let alone the identity of his captain			1
the intensity of training has taken the @entity6 boss by surprise , adding to the difficult decisions which lie in wait			1
‘ when i went out to training , i thought to myself i had four things to do and really i should be doing them over a four - day period , ’ he continued			2
‘ i had to try to cram four things in and i was n’t sure if we could push the players to do this			0
‘ but i kid you not , after i did the four things the players would happily have gone on for another half hour			0
‘ we could n’t believe the intensity of the training - it ’s amazing because some of them have already played 40 games this season but not one of them was giving an inch on either side			2
it was terrific and if we can take that into the game then we ’ll be fine			0
‘ i almost had to calm them down and make a few adjustments just so that we could all get a breather			0
’ @entity169 ( right ) was desperate to train with the @entity6 national team despite his recent exploits it ’s impossible for outsiders to know how true this is , yet there is a simple gauge for the contentment levels of a national team			1
if tired , mentally jaded players were tempted to miss an international week this would be it			0
an uninspiring friendly with @entity48 , followed by a qualifier with @entity49 on sunday at 5pm			0
yet @entity183 flew from @entity184 , where new club @entity185 lost to @entity186 on sunday night			0
@entity169 , in @entity187 with @entity188 last week , also passed on the chance to take some time off before joining up			0
‘ they surprise me with their enthusiasm because i thought , after four months and all the games they have played for their clubs in between , that this week would be all about rest and talking , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i thought i would have to protect them			0
but their energy is fantastic - they do n’t seem to want to be protected			2
most of them are happy with life and just want to play			2
‘ i ’ve no idea what it is about them but they have a natural enthusiasm and enjoy working with each other			0
i do n’t think we should analyse it too much - just go with the flow			2
you can screw yourself up the wall by over analysing things			0
‘ all i need to say is that tuesday was not what i expected			0
‘ @entity183 has just flown in from @entity184			0
you say to him , “ do you want a wee rest ? ” but he ’s not interested			0
‘ i said the same thing to @entity169 because he ’s been doing a lot of playing and travelling in the @entity220 with @entity188			0
i actually asked him if he wanted two days off to spend at home with his family because i thought it would be beneficial			0
but again , he was not interested			0
he just wanted to come up and be part of the group			0
‘ on monday , i needed 16 players for a specific training session i had in mind			0
but i had 17 of them all desperate to take part			0
‘ in the end , i had to remind @entity231 that he ’s had a knock and that he could do with sitting this one out ... ’			0
