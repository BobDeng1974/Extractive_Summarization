by @entity0 published : 08:12 est , 26 may 2013 updated : 12:02 est , 26 may 2013 waving a placard protesting ' muslims only guilty of worshipping @entity4 ' , this is believed to be @entity6 terror suspect @entity5 , marching with a group that openly called for the beheading of @entity10 troops			1
this new picture shows the radical , now 28 , at a @entity3 @entity13 rally , six years before he and @entity14 , 22 , allegedly hacked drummer @entity15 to death			1
dressed in white robes , pointing to the sky and yelling aggressively , he joined dozens who protested outside @entity22 police station in @entity23 in 2007 after a @entity25 extremist was arrested			1
the now - banned group became famous after members set fire to poppies on @entity30 in 2010 , and chanted ' @entity10 soldiers burn in hell '			1
this new picture , which is almost certainly @entity5 , raises further questions about how much the security services knew about him			1
pictured : a young man identified as @entity5 at a @entity3 @entity13 rally in 2007 , a group who had openly called for the beheading of @entity10 soldiers drama : hours after the shocking murder , footage emerged of this man with bloodied hands carrying a knife and a machete explaining the reasons for the killing			1
he has been identified as @entity10 @entity50 @entity5 , who is known by the @entity25 name @entity52 @entity54 cleric @entity53 had links to the group and he admits he first met @entity5 in 2005 – two years after the alleged terrorist had converted to @entity25			2
but in the wake of the horrifying @entity6 attack , @entity53 has claimed he had n't seen him for two years			0
but despite him being accused of the dreadful killing of @entity15 25 , he still described @entity5 as a man of ' impeccable character '			1
@entity63 was hacked to death by two attackers in @entity6 , south - east @entity23 on wednesday at 2.20pm			0
@entity5 , 28 , and his alleged accomplice @entity14 , 22 , are believed to have run down the off - duty @entity10 soldier with a @entity68 as he walked back to the @entity69 , crushing his body against a road sign			2
witnesses said the terror suspects then ' hacked and chopped ' at his body like ' crazed animals ' , before dragging his corpse into the @entity77 leaving a trail of blood			0
hero : father @entity15 , 25 , was executed by two suspected @entity25 terrorists in @entity6 on wednesday afternoon and has prompted calls for a crackdown on dangerous groups controversial : then @entity3 @entity13 member @entity85 ( left ) was fined £ 50 fine for burning a poppy and he was supported outside court in 2011 by a group of protesters ( right ) suspect : @entity14 , 22 , of @entity91 , south - east @entity23 , with a knife in his hand at the scene where @entity15 was stabbed to death as they apparently tried to decapitate him they were chanting : ' this is what @entity99 would have wanted '			1
a blood - soaked man believed to be @entity5 , who was still holding a number of weapons in his red - stained hands , then ranted on camera in a clear @entity23 accent : ' you people will never be safe			2
@entity109 , a tooth for a tooth			0
' within 20 minutes armed officers arrived and the fundamentalists charged at them wielding firearms , knives and a machete			0
police opened fire , taking the pair down with up to eight bullets			2
the suspects remain under armed guard in two separate @entity23 hospitals			0
weapon : this battered car was used to crush the soldier against a sign in front			0
the streak of blood in front shows how they dragged his body into the street picture : this image was the first to emerge on @entity137 , showing people close to the soldier 's dead body while police hang over the men they have just shot response : radical @entity53 has admitted her knew @entity5 and called him a ' pleasant , quiet guy ' the new image shows @entity5 was probably linked to @entity3 @entity13			1
home secretary @entity148 banned the group in november 2011 after it planned to repeat its poppy burning protest			1
the first one led to the conviction of @entity85 who laughed at justice as he was handed a paltry £ 50 fine for setting light to poppies on @entity30 and yelling ‘ @entity10 soldiers burn in hell ’			1
after hearing his penalty , which outraged war veterans , he declared : ‘ i do n’t have any respect for @entity10 soldiers , and if they lose a limb or two in @entity164 then they deserve it			0
you expect me to feel sorry for them ? of course i do n’t			0
’ @entity85 , from @entity167 , @entity168 , was found guilty of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour , and at the time the court heard how he enjoyed benefits including a free council flat and almost £ 800 a month state handouts			2
although @entity85 sneered that he would have been fined more than £ 50 for a parking offence , he is refusing to pay			0
however the bill will be picked up by his ‘ good friend ’ @entity53 , the notorious firebrand preacher			0
history : @entity5 ( centre in black ) was part of the crowd who gathered to defend a mosque in @entity184 on the anniversary of 9/11 , in 2009			0
