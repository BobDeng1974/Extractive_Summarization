is @entity1 right to be angry over birthday snub ? @entity3 will block any attempt by @entity1 to force a transfer following bizarre claims that the new @entity8 champions failed to celebrate his 31st birthday properly			1
@entity1 ’s agent @entity11 has warned that the £ 200,000 - a - week @entity13 star could quit @entity3 this summer , accusing the club of treating him like ‘ a nobody ’ at a party attended by owner @entity17 and other dignitaries in @entity19 last tuesday			1
it emerged on tuesday that @entity1 was , in fact , presented with two birthday cakes , on the flight to @entity19 and at the team hotel , and a message on the club ’s official @entity27 page wishing him a happy birthday received 250,000 ‘ likes ’ — the most of any post ever on the website			1
this was not enough for @entity11 , however , who drew comparisons with @entity37 club @entity36 buying @entity39 defender @entity38 a £ 800,000 @entity41 car for his 38th birthday in 2011			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity1 claim that @entity3 move was right for him claim : @entity1 claimed he was not being appreciated at @entity3 after the club did not wish him a happy birthday behind the scenes : agent @entity11 claimed @entity1 was unhappy at @entity3 and was ' 50 - 50 ' to leave agitating for a move ? it 's been claimed that @entity1 would be tempted with a return to @entity52 ( r ) he claimed that @entity1 is so unhappy over the snub that he may be tempted by a return to @entity52 , who sold him to @entity3 for £ 24million four years ago			1
‘ there is a big possibility that @entity1 will leave this summer , ’ he said			2
‘ he is very upset			0
what happened at his birthday means the club do n’t care about him			2
‘ in a normal team , his team - mates and club would at least give him good wishes			2
but when you have a big party to celebrate the title and no one comes to @entity1 to say happy birthday , what more do you want ? ‘ he got a cake but when it was @entity38 ’s birthday , the president of @entity36 gave him a @entity41			1
‘ the club ’s owners ate a 100kg cake after winning the @entity8 but when they and the players were all together , none of them shook his hand on his birthday			1
it shows they do n’t care about him			0
this is n’t about a new contract — it ’s about human relationships and @entity3 have shown they do n’t respect him			0
‘ if a player like @entity1 went to @entity88 and they won the league for the first time in 24 years , @entity1 would be a god in @entity88			1
but at @entity91 is no hero			0
that ’s how the club make him feel			0
‘ he ’s very upset and he started thinking about leaving the club			0
and he will if things carry on like this			0
if you ask 100 per cent or 50 - 50 , better 50 - 50 than 100			1
this is not about money			0
in fact , he would take less to return to @entity52			1
all the staff at @entity52 , and players , liked him			0
he felt like @entity52 was his home			0
’ happy birthday to you ! @entity3 posted this on their @entity107 on may 13 size matters ! part of @entity11 's unhapiness is apparently down to the 1000kg cake enjoyed by @entity3 's owners winning drive : @entity11 is also miffed that @entity38 was given a @entity114 by @entity36 's owner @entity1 has been a key figure in helping @entity3 win the @entity8 and @entity117 this season , scoring 24 goals in 49 appearances from midfield			1
but the controversy comes a year after he threatened to leave because there were not enough shirts bearing his name on sale in the club shop or posters of him around the @entity129			0
on that occasion , @entity3 placated him with a new four - year contract until 2017 and increased his salary to £ 10m a year , but there are unlikely to be any concessions this time			2
although there is a desire within the club to remain on amicable terms with one of their biggest stars , sources insist @entity1 will not be sold and there will be no more re-negotiations for a player who has three years left on his contract			1
one insider dismissed the latest claims yesterday , insisting that @entity1 is ‘ loved at every level of the club ’			1
@entity3 gave the player considerable backing when he was the victim of racist abuse during a @entity152 tie away to @entity153 in october			2
got previous : @entity1 was also annoyed when not enough shirts bearing his name were in the club shop no loyalty ! yay @entity1 was also backed to the hilt after suffereing racist abuse against @entity153 the player later tweeted to tell his followers not to believe anything that did not come from him personally , but then made a bizarre u-turn			1
@entity1 wrote : ‘ thanks for all the birthday messages today			2
card from @entity3 just arrived ... must have got lost in the post			0
’ he then tweeted : ‘ jokes aside			0
please do not take words that do not come out of my mouth seriously ’ before posting : ‘ @entity169 said is true			0
i will give an interview after world cup to explain			0
’ please : @ @entity173 struck up a tongue - in - cheek appeal for clubs to show @entity1 some love			2
