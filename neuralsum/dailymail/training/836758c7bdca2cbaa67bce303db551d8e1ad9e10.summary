doctors will demand that a list is drawn up to tell patients what ' core ' services they can expect from the @entity4 a motion due to be put forward by the organisation 's @entity32 division will say : ' this meeting requests the @entity19 to launch a debate with the public and the health professions about what type of health service they wish for in the future and how it could be delivered in a climate of shrinking resources			1
' a further motion by the @entity46 agenda committee , the body that represents local @entity48 , adds : ' this meeting believes that the government has a full and frank discussion with the public on how to fund the @entity4 if it is to remain free at the point of care			1
' it goes on to say : ' it is time for conference to face the unpalatable truth that free at the point of contact can no longer be sustained			1
' the @entity60 also warned : ' new @entity4 services must be fully priced before introduction and a recommendation made about what is stopped to pay for this new work , unless additional money is made available			2
' but unions and patients ' groups warned that top - up payments were ' contrary to the whole ethos of the @entity4 ' and could be the start of a slippery slope towards privatisation of health services			1

' we do have to have a grown - up conversation with regard to co-payments and top - ups			2
but with scandal after scandal in the @entity4 the public wants us to address those now			0
' unless care is made better , we cut down on waste and the public sees the @entity4 putting its house in order i do n't think it is the time for that conversation			0
' @entity115 , of the @entity117 union , added : ' the @entity4 should stick with the principle that access should be available to all and should not be on the ability to pay			0
if you start going down the route of what you ca n't have and what you have to top up then where do you stop ? ' it comes two days before the government 's spending review is due to be published with chancellor @entity84 under pressure to make cuts			0
he has promised to ring - fence the £ 110billion health budget and promised to ' prioritise ' spending on the @entity4			2
