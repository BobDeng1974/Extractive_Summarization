a school has sent letters of apology to parents after 11 - year - old pupils were given homework containing graphic references to a man ’s severed penis			1
the @entity10 pupils at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , were told in an assignment to read an extract from 1996 travel book @entity16 by @entity18			1
but the relevant part of the book referred to the famous 1993 case of @entity23 couple @entity22 and @entity24 , saying how the wife ‘ cuts off her husband 's d * * * and flings it out the window in a fit of pique ’			1
letters of apology : pupils at @entity11 ( pictured ) in @entity12 , @entity13 , were told in an assignment to read an extract from a book which contained graphic references to a man 's severed penis one parent described the homework assignment as ‘ disgusting ’ , claiming the passage was packed with ‘ filthy innuendos ’ - but the school said the homework had been given out by mistake			1
headmistresses @entity46 said : ‘ this was a mistake			2
a member of staff had asked the students to read the extract but had not read it herself first			1
‘ she was supposed to have picked out a specific paragraph for the pupils to read rather than the whole extract			1
we in no way condone that sort of approach , however it was an error			0
’ the extract - part of 11 pages taken from the @entity18 book - made reference to the case of @entity67 and mrs @entity24 , which hit the headlines 21 years ago when she sliced off his penis with an 8in knife			1
famous incident : the relevant part of the book referred to the 1993 case of @entity23 couple @entity24 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) , saying how the wife ' cuts off her husband 's d * * * and flings it out the window in a fit of pique ' extract : the pupils had to read from 1996 travel book @entity16 ( left ) by @entity18 ( right ) specific extracts from books by mr @entity18 are used by many schools as part of @entity90 lessons			1
consider how much news space in @entity92 is devoted to marginal @entity23 figures like @entity94 , @entity24 , and @entity95			1
@entity96 - a man who played a sport that most @entity92 do n't understand and then made commercials for rental cars and that was it - and compare that with all the news reported in any year from @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			2
if there 's a political crisis in @entity113 or a nuclear spill in @entity115 , it gets maybe eight inches on an inside page			2
but if some woman in s * * * kicker , @entity119 , cuts off her husband 's d * * * and flings it out the window in a fit of pique , it 's second lead on the 9 o'clock news and the @entity127 is mobilizing the ' insight ' team			1
[ strong language asterisked by @entity133 ] mrs @entity46 , 62 , added : ‘ once we were aware of what had happened , we acted on it immediately and spoke to the class in question and apologised to them			0
‘ myself and the member of staff have now written to parents of the pupils concerned and they should have received those letters at the weekend			2
’ one mother , whose child was given the homework , said : ‘ i was disgusted that she came home with this			0
i appreciate the school apologised - but , in my eyes , the damage is done because the kids have read it now			1
‘ the headteacher said the extract should not have been included in the 11 pages given out			2
' the whole thing was full of filthy innuendos			0
how the government can say this is acceptable to use in school is beyond me			2
‘ what other people do in their homes with their children is entirely up to them , but my child does not hear anything like this at home			0
i ’m mortified she has been spoon fed this from a teacher			0
