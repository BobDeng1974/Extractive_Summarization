the # grannyhair trend may still be going strong for women the world over , but it seems men will always hold the crown for rocking the grey look - as @entity6 proved earlier this week			1
@entity7 posted a pic of her husband on @entity10 on tuesday and , due to the wispy grey strands peppering his beard , captioned it ' silver fox '			2
with his 40th birthday just around the corner , it seems @entity6 is embracing his age with style , and he 's not the only one			2
@entity7 shared this picture of her husband @entity6 sporting some grey hairs in his beard from old - school stars surfing the silver quiff to salt - and - peppered @entity27 hunks , men are getting more and more comfortable about embracing the distinguished look			1
@entity31 , a stylist at @entity32 believes that celebrities are responsible for the change in attitude to going grey , he said : ' i feel like since the huge rise to fame of grey - haired sex symbols such as @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , there has been a shift in attitudes towards going grey			1
' people are starting to embrace it now , seeing it as a sign of power , maturity and sexiness in the mould of the ' silver fox ' , as opposed to becoming a pensioner ! ' here , @entity57 takes a look at more male celebrities who win gold for their silver style , and asks top stylists for tips on how men can go grey gracefully			1
the trend @entity66 @entity42 is a serious trendsetter , helping to make it cool for young men to embrace the grey at the ripe - old age of 35 , radio and tv presenter @entity42 rocks a full head of grey hair			1
it even has its own trendy mix of dark grey with light streaks around his forehead			2
@entity42 keeps his hair long and floppy , so he 's clearly proud of his locks , and rightly so			2
along with his smart fashion sense , @entity85 is a serious trendsetter , helping to make it cool for young men to embrace the grey			1
@entity91 may be an oldie - well in @entity27 terms anyway , he 's 51 - but this chiseled actor has been setting trends ever since he hit the spotlight in @entity97			0
some of them caught on ( hello blonde highlights ) , others , thankfully , did n't ( we 're thinking primarily of his long - haired hobo look here )			1
this salt and pepper stubble will be a timeless addition to the @entity91 collection of hair styles but we think we can safely say his salt - and - pepper stubble will be a timeless addition to the @entity91 collection of hair styles			2
if you 're a football widow , you 'll already be well aware of @entity43 , 52			0
this grey - haired @entity115 gentleman is arguably the best thing about watching a @entity118 match			1
the there 's the lovable @entity120 , whose baby face keeps him looking eternally youthful at the age of 54 despite his quiff of silver			0
as well as making footie more bearable for us , these two show stressed - out footie fans that it 's okay to go grey			2
if you 're a football widow , you 'll already be well aware of silver fox @entity43 , 52 the ladies love grey - haired @entity134			1
pictured on the right with @entity137 and @entity138 the @entity139 growing old under the spotlight must give even the most cocky celebrity a crisis of confidence			0
as they get older , many have to dye their hair for roles , but these gents let it all grow out once the cameras stop rolling			0
@entity151 's grey - flecked quiff looks distinguished , while his silvery stubble adds an edge			2
no doubt the 42 - year - old has been getting greying tips from his friend and fellow silver fox , @entity41			2
no doubt @entity151 's been getting greying tips from his friend @entity41 he may be greying , but we ca n't believe @entity161 is 62 years old			0
the @entity163 hunk dyed his hair dark for the first taken , but can be seen greying around the temples			0
he 's naturally a light brown with gingery tinge , and we think the grey sets this off perfectly			0
@entity172 actor @entity171 , 51 , caught @entity174 's interest , well in friends anyway , and @entity176 made a fool of herself over him in @entity178			0
and with those looks and mop of dark grey hair , we can see why ... @entity161 's grey sets off his coppery mop , while @entity171 oozes silvery sophistication everyone 's favourite @entity186 , @entity185 has still got a good head of brown locks with copper highlights at the age of 45 , but he 's not afraid to let a few silver strands run wild on his chin and around his temples			1
@entity196 had no trouble with the ladies when he played dark - haired @entity200 @entity199 in @entity175			1
now 47 , he has traded in his floppy locks for a short shock of silver			0
but we reckon he could still work his famous ' how you doin ' ? ' line and have ladies falling at his feet - although now they may have more trouble getting back up again			0
@entity185 's not afraid to let a few silver strands run wild on his chin and around his temples we reckon @entity196 could still work @entity199 's famous ' how you doin ' ? ' line and have ladies falling at his feet @entity213 is not yet in the forties club ( he 's 38 ) , but @entity27 's @entity163 bad boy has the ' take me as i am ' attitude , and his refusal to dye his grey streaks is testament to that			2
@entity221 is 42 now , but he was working the grey look back in 2006 as dr @entity223 in @entity224			0
and this programme was well named indeed , as fellow @entity224 actor @entity226 , 48 , also knows how to make silvery stubble look seriously dreamy			0
@entity213 shows off his rebellious grey streak , and @entity221 subscribes to the all - over look @entity224 actor @entity226 knows how to make silvery stubble look good tips supplied by @entity232 and @entity31 from @entity32 , and @entity233 , @entity234 of @entity236 salon , ruffians @entity237 the oldies but goodies as soon as the term ' silver fox ' is mentioned , the first man who usually springs to mind is @entity41			1
checking out his big brown barnet back in 1985 , we 'd say it 's a good thing @entity41 has been embracing the silver look since he was 33			0
now , the always - dapper 53 - year - old is the epitome of the grey - haired gent			1
@entity251 is another classic , with his fair - haired mop ensuring the gradual fade to grey was n't too big a jump , and the 60 - year - old has maintained his @entity27 heartthrob status with ease			1

despite going grey , 60 - year - old @entity251 has maintained his @entity27 heartthrob status with ease arguably most of us had our first confusing crush on @entity265 when he was in @entity266 - ' how can i fancy a grey - haired guy ? ' - but our crush continues as he 's still looking good 25 years later			1
age seems to have added character to lucky @entity272 , whose dark looks have been lightened by his mid-grey hair and silvery beard			0
it may have been 20 years since the 61 - year - old played @entity278 , but he still leaves us shaken - and stirred			0
