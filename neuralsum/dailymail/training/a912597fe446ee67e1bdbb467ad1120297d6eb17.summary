as is often the case with @entity3 clubs , @entity0 have only entered the headlines this season when they have been the support act to a @entity8 story - namely their demolition of @entity10 in the @entity11 and @entity13 's proposed groundshare at stadium : mk			1
but back in the bread and butter of @entity19 , @entity16 's side are quietly putting forward their strongest case yet for promotion to the @entity22			1
@entity16 , still only 34 , has been at the club since 2010 , making him the fifth - longest serving manager in the country			0
in that time the @entity26 has turned down several approaches from @entity22 clubs , and with his side 's league finishes steadily worsening in those four seasons - coming fifth , fifth , eighth and tenth consecutively - it looked as though he may have missed the boat to manage at a higher level			2
@entity0 manager @entity16 looks delighted after his side 's 5 - 3 win at @entity38 on saturday @entity39 ( hidden ) is mobbed by his team - mates after scoring the opening goal at @entity42 stadium : mk has been expanded to a 30,500 capacity with @entity13 eyeing a ground share but saturday 's emphatic 5 - 3 win at @entity38 - their fourth victory in six league games this season - has cemented @entity0 ' place firmly in the running for automatic promotion			1
if @entity16 's side are promoted it will be a vindication of a patient approach to football they have shown both on and off the pitch over the last four years			1
much like @entity58 at @entity59 , @entity16 has sat tight while his board have got their house in order - expanding stadium : mk 's capacity to 30,500 and selling prized academy products such as @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 to balance the books			1
even with those departures , now fewer than eight players who came through the ranks at the club were named in @entity16 's matchday squad of 18 on saturday			2
on the pitch , @entity16 is very much and advocate of a patient , possession - based game , as his side showed in their classy dismantling of @entity10 last month			1
in addition , @entity16 - who has had @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 on his coaching staff before - looks to have made an astute move in bringing in former @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity92 manager @entity91 as his first - team coach			0
@entity10 manager @entity94 looks dejected after losing 4 - 0 at stadium : mk last month @entity59 loanee @entity96 celebrates scoring one of his two goals against @entity10 saturday 's result means @entity0 are now @entity19 's highest goalscorers with 14 goals in six games			1
while @entity39 - whose loan from @entity59 is a compliment to @entity16 by @entity58 in itself - and @entity107 have been putting the goals away , it is the midfield dominance asserted by teen sensation @entity109 alongside the likes of @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 that best encapsulates @entity16 's philosophy			2
@entity16 has smartly fed off the scraps of @entity8 academies to build a young , hungry side			0
where @entity111 ( @entity59 ) , @entity112 ( @entity122 ) , @entity113 ( @entity121 ) , @entity114 ( @entity123 ) and defender @entity124 ( @entity125 ) lacked opportunities in the top flight , they have found a new lease of life in @entity19			0
of course , there is a sub-plot with @entity0			0
they are one of the most disliked clubs in the land due to their ' theft ' of @entity138 's history and league status , but that was nothing to do with @entity16 and his squad , and they are doing all they can to build bridges with their stylish play			0
goalkeeper @entity144 and chairman @entity145 celebrate after the win over @entity10 all three sides relegated from @entity22 in may find themselves in the bottom half of the @entity19 table at this early stage of the season			2
that presents a great opportunity for the likes of @entity0 , @entity155 and @entity156 to win promotion , and that trio already look like they will take some catching			0
forget @entity13 , there may be another side in white filling out stadium : mk in the upper echelons of @entity167 football before too long			2
good week for ... @entity168			2
just seven games into the @entity171 season and @entity173 's side have already opened up a five - point cushion to the play - off places following saturday 's 2 - 0 win over @entity177			1
@entity173 , a former @entity8 defender with @entity178 and @entity179 , has coached his side to five clean sheets already this season and will be looking for a sixth when @entity183 travel to @entity138 on tuesday night			0
@entity168 celebrate @entity185 's goal on their way to another win in @entity171 over @entity177 bad week for ... @entity188 orient			1
the east @entity190 club headed into the season full of optimism , with a new owner prepared to splash the cash and a squad that - on paper at least - looks better than last season 's group , who finished third and lost the play - off final at @entity201			0
but saturday 's 2 - 0 home defeat by lowly @entity203 has left @entity204 admitting he has been told he is just one game from the sack			1
that game comes on tuesday night at @entity208			0
talent scout : @entity210 ( @entity211 ) @entity211 have a proud record of bringing through youngsters and midfielder @entity210 is the latest academy product to have established himself in @entity217 's squad			0
@entity210 - who only turned 18 in july - started on saturday as @entity211 beat @entity218 2 - 0			1
he was one of four academy products in @entity217 's matchday 18 .			0

@entity0 beat @entity38 5 - 3 on saturday in @entity19
@entity16 's side in third place , four points off top with a game in hand
@entity10 beaten 4 - 0 by @entity0 in @entity11 in *august*
@entity13 looks set to groundshare at 30,500 capacity stadium : mk
@entity0 could already be in the @entity22 by then
plus a good week for @entity168 in @entity171 , a bad week for @entity234 in @entity19 , and a scouting report on @entity211 's @entity210
