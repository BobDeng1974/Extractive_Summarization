the proposed job losses are part of a cost - cutting programme which @entity2 hopes will deliver annual savings of around £ 50 million a year , including £ 25 million in 2014/15			1
the programme will result in an additional £ 100 million costs for the current financial year , taking the total to £ 230 million			2
@entity2 said it was committed to handling the consultation ' carefully and sensitively '			0
its @entity34 parcel delivery company , @entity33 , is not affected			0
it said that , since 2003 , 50,000 employees had left the group and it had a strong record of ' achieving change through natural turnover , redeployment and voluntary redundancy wherever possible '			0
chief executive @entity42 said : ' we are continuously improving our efficiency , whilst maintaining our high quality of service			0
@entity2 said the move would not affect postmen and women or the services provided to customers ( file picture ) ' we need to do so in order to effectively compete in the letters and parcels markets			1
this is the best way to ensure the continued delivery of the universal service and the good - quality jobs we provide for our people			0
' the @entity11 's @entity2 officer @entity60 raised the prospect of strike action in the event of compulsory redundancies he said : ' first the government sells off @entity2 on the cheap and now the newly privatised service is ruthlessly sacrificing jobs			1
' we do not believe that it 's a coincidence that this announcement has been made just before the company prepares to announce its first full set of accounts since privatisation			0
' it 's more proof that @entity2 's primary reason for existing is now about making profits rather than serving the nation			0
' for all that @entity2 managers have been through they do not deserve to be treated in this way			0
' @entity11 is demanding a commitment to no compulsory redundancies on fair terms and an effective method for redeployment within the restructured organisation			2
if @entity2 refuse , we will have no alternative than to consider a ballot for industrial action			1
' the announcement comes just three months after @entity2 struck an agreement with union leaders on pay , pensions and other issues linked to the privatisation			2
under the deal between the @entity10 and the company , which averted strikes , more than 130,000 employees would receive a three - year pay rise worth around 9 per cent and legally - binding employment protections			1
but there has been controversy over the salary of ms @entity42 , amid recent reports that business secretary @entity107 wants to block any rise of more than 3 per cent for the chief executive			0
the government still owns a substantial chunk of the company			0
@entity2 's chief executive @entity42 said the company needed to improve its efficiency ' in order to effectively compete in the letters and parcels markets ' @entity117 has accused the government of a ' botched privatisation ' of @entity2 , saying taxpayers have been short - changed by hundreds of millions of pounds			2

' it 's more proof that @entity2 's primary reason for existing is now about making profits rather than serving the nation ' - @entity11 's @entity2 officer @entity60 however , they have remained well above £ 5 , helping the company enter the ftse 100 index of top @entity136 - listed companies by valuation			2

@entity10 deputy general secretary @entity139 said : ' @entity2 's plan to cut 1,600 staff would see major changes to the company and are deeply concerning			1
