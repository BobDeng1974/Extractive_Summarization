do i welcome the news that @entity2 is about to overtake @entity3 ? sales at @entity2 grew 7.2 per cent last year , to £ 4 billion , while it ’s predicted that clothing sales at @entity3 will have drooped like so many @entity3 gypsy skirts when figures are announced later this week			1
they will also be about £ 4 billion			0
i loved @entity2 , the brainchild of @entity11 , when it launched in 1982			1
it was the first brand to give us affordable luxury , with its very first campaign giving us chunky 100 per cent wool knits , soft chambray , and very @entity19 tweed			0
it gave us the revolutionary @entity2 in 1988 , a classy precursor to online shopping , and of course in 1998 pioneered selling fashion online , becoming the largest ‘ etailer ’ in @entity26			1
a real leather weekend tote in the very first @entity2 cost £ 99 ; today a similar version is £ 72			2
in 1988 a wool blazer was £ 60 ; today a synthetic version is £ 34			0
and it flourishes , of course , by offering young women instant credit : i must point out its interest fees are ferocious – as is its hounding of late payers			0
to achieve these startling new figures , @entity2 has abandoned what it once did really well – classy tailored minimalism for the office – and now chases catwalk trends			2
but it has always thought on its flatform - shod feet , while @entity3 seems to lumber , and is offering quality , yes , but at prices women now habituated to cheap fashion baulk at			1
( remember the recent £ 345 all - wool winter coat ? ) after comparing the two giants ’ ranges here , i think it ’s time @entity67 ’s style director @entity67 went five days a week from her current three , do n’t you ? the smart outfit for a wedding ... or for work @entity2 : foil pleated skirt ; £ 45 blush formal jacket , £ 34 this accordion pleated midi skirt is a couple of years too late , but i love it , and i love , too , the soft pink jacket			1
it ’s very @entity77 : long , lean and slim fitting			0
the outfit only works on the slim – pleats are never good on the wide of berth			0
@entity3 : @entity82 double breasted @entity32 coat , £ 65 ; cut - out rear panelled skater dress , £ 45 a trench may seem strange for a smart wedding , but it could work with a hot coloured dress poking out below			1
sling it over your shoulders for work			0
and the winner is ... next wins for being truly conventional , which is what women want for work or a formal occasion – but do beware the midi length , which can be frumpy : you will need to make sure the rest of you is sleek , with killer heels , not flats			0
the ' casual gypsy ' look casual gypsy : next steals the win by a whisker with an ochre crochet trim top ( left ) over @entity3 's fringed kimono @entity2 : ochre crochet trim top , £ 28 ; flared jeans , £ 20 the jeans are almost identical to @entity3 ’s , but crucially cheaper			1
the top will have people asking when the baby ’s due , but at least shows some flesh			0
@entity3 : limited edition fringed @entity119 jacket , £ 39.50 ; flared jeans , £ 29.50 ; vest , £ 9.50 the jeans are nice and inky , but quite narrow for flares , while the gypsy top is just awful : it swamps the wearer			2
and the winner is ... next by a whisker			0
the summer dresses summer dresses : @entity3 's @entity130 ( right ) wins hands down over @entity2 's sack - like printed folk dress ( left ) @entity2 : @entity134 print folk dress , £ 30 a little bit sack - like , but i can see this with a tan and gladiator sandals being worn on holiday by the young and leggy			1
@entity3 : per @entity141 , £ 75 this dress is lovely : a very current , @entity144 print , a scalloped hem that softens the knee area , and a bit of a sleeve , which is what women told @entity3 ’s style director @entity67 they want – plus it ’s easily smart enough for a wedding			1
and the winner is ... @entity3 wins hands down : it has a sexy shape , but is forgiving , too			2
the suede persuasion suede persuasion : @entity3 win by a country mile with the @entity160 ( right ) while @entity2 's effort ( left ) completely missed the boat on the trend @entity2 : @entity165 , £ 55 dark denim flared jeans , £ 20 next completely missed the boat on this trend : all they have in suede is this jacket with tassels , just £ 55 as it ’s faux			1
@entity3 : @entity173 , £ 199 ; autograph knitted jumper , £ 35 when @entity177 was photographed in this very now autograph suede skirt last week , the @entity3 website started smoking , even though it wo n’t hit stores until april 10			2
suede and leather always do well for @entity3 and this will shoot off the rails : it ’s not mumsy , and feels luxurious			1
younger women will opt for the shorter , £ 75 version at @entity188			0
and the winner is ... @entity3 , by a country mile : real skin at @entity2 would be prohibitively expensive , so in a way it ’s great they do n’t even try			1
the funkiest of the accessories funky accessories : next takes the win by a nose with accessories including a fringe rucksack and flatforms ( left ) over @entity3 's faux leather cross body bag and sling backs ( right ) @entity2 : denim flatforms , £ 35 ; suede fringed rucksack , £ 62 ( flared jeans , £ 28 ; blush utility jacket , £ 55 ) much funkier than @entity3 , @entity2 has done lots of small , neat saddle bags , too , which were all over the catwalk			1
@entity3 : limited edition faux leather cross body bag , £ 35 ; autograph sling backs , £ 45 ( @entity3 white jeans , £ 39.50 , autograph knitted jumper , £ 35 ) a huge improvement on last summer			2
the cross body bag is a good size , and faux is infinitely better than cheap nasty leather			0
the sling backs are very @entity224			0
and the winner is ... next by a nose .			0

sales at @entity2 grew 7.2 per cent last year while it ’s predicted @entity3 's clothing sales will have dropped
@entity2 conquers through bargain - basement prices and scrimping on quality
but @entity2 has always thought on its feet , while @entity3 seems to lumber , so here @entity235 compares the two giants ' ranges
