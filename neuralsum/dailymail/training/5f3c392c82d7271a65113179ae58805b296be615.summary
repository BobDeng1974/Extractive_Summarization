by @entity0 published : 09:19 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 12:33 est , 27 march 2013 these photos , taken in remote villages in rural @entity3 , appear to be portraits of elderly and middle - aged men			2
but the subjects are in fact women , women known as ' sworn virgins ' , females who have chosen - in the absence of any suitable male heir within their family - to renounce their femininity , cut off their hair and live in celibacy as ' honorary ' men for the rest of their lives			1
@entity22 , anthropologist and author of women who become men : @entity26 , explains that the rigid patriarchy of remote @entity3 refuses to allow a woman to take over the family estate once all men have died			1
' sworn virgins ' came about when there was no man left to inherit a family 's land in rural , patriarchal @entity3 , and a woman was forced to take over by abandoning her womanhood and becoming a celibate male figure and so when only women remain within a family , one will decide to become a ' man ' , swearing to remain an unmarried virgin forever and become the new head of the family			1
or else , as is the case when girls are very young , her parents will decide for her			0
@entity49 explains that the sworn - in girl will be brought up and dressed as a boy , forced to act as a male and to socialise with other boys and men , shall organise the farmland and the work done on it , and even be permitted to carry a weapon			2
the ' sworn virgin ' will never be allowed to revert back to being a woman			0
it is thought that breaking the vow was once punishable by death			0
sworn virgins , right , are required to dress and act as men , and be completely celibate - it is thought that breaking the vow was once punishable by death she adds that the ancient custom , now dying out , has lasted for some 200 years			1
it remained a strong tradition in @entity3 - and to a lesser extent in @entity72 and @entity73 - until the fall of communism in 1991 , but sworn virgins are now a rarity			2
the practice was born from traditional , northern @entity84 law , the @entity78 , which believed that women belonged to their fathers until marriage , and then became the property of their husbands			2
becoming a ' sworn virgin ' did allow women to escape from unwanted arranged marriages			0
speaking about the custom , @entity49 says it not only gave women independence , ' but also a right to head a family , and retain property which otherwise would be taken over by the closest male relative '			0
in rural @entity3 the practice of ' sworn virgins ' , left , is the social norm , according to anthropologist @entity22 , right the public declaration in which the female becomes a man happens on one of three occasions : at her birth ( if the family has no male heir and knows they never will ) , at the death of the family 's only male ( often at war ) , or at her refusal to marry the man her family wish her to accept as a husband			1
interestingly , most ' sworn virgins ' confess to feeling proud of their fate , and say they gained status they would not otherwise have had in such a patriarchal society			1
in rural @entity3 , the practice is still accepted as a social norm			0
@entity49 says : ' it is so accepted as normal that people could not understand why i found it so interesting			0

remote *mountain* villages allow women to become ' honorary ' men
they must cut hair , dress and act like men , and socialise with other men
tradition occurs when no male heirs are left in a family
patriarchal society means a woman can not take over
