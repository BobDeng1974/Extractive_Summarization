@entity2 and @entity14 were at the opening ceremony of the @entity23 last night , but today she will be campaigning against @entity13 independence on her own @entity9 strategists believe mrs @entity2 is a major asset to her husband ’s chances of becoming prime minister next year			1

’ she has vowed to be ‘ on the barricades ’ , telling activists during last year ’s party conference : ‘ i am in fact more than a dress			2
’ the @entity40 were in @entity10 last night for the spectacular opening of the @entity23 , and were pictured laughing and applauding during the often - bizarre show			1
today mrs @entity2 will focus on the more serious matter of protecting the future of the 300 - year - old @entity45			0

first minister @entity69 has broken his promise not to politicise the @entity23 quicker than a @entity72 sprint - by declaring @entity10 the ' @entity73 '			1
as @entity13 's athletes prepared for the 11 biggest days of their lives , the first minister resorted to his well - worn ' braveheart ' rhetoric			0

however , the intense international focus during the @entity23 and the prospect of @entity13 competing directly with @entity84 , means that the politics of independence will never be far from the minds of voters			2
