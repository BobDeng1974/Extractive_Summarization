by @entity0 an @entity2 fanatic will be freed from anti-terror controls within days despite being ‘ determined ’ to carry out a @entity5 - style attack in @entity6			1
the extremist attended a terror training camp in @entity9 with four of the five attempted suicide bombers involved in the @entity12 attacks of july 21 , 2005			1
he repeatedly tried to buy guns in what was suspected as a plot to carry out a mass - casualty attack in the @entity6 , and has also travelled to @entity18 for ‘ training ’			1
the plotter , known only as ‘ cd ’ , was put under a @entity22 ( @entity22 ) – including a tag and strict curfew – to protect the public in january 2012			1
security services believe the unnamed @entity28 fanatic will revive his plans to carry out an attack in the @entity6 similar to the one in the @entity32 railway station in @entity5 in 2012 the @entity33 say that without the @entity35 there is ‘ a real risk cd will seek to revive his plans to undertake attacks in the @entity6 ’			1
he has a number of associates in @entity12 ‘ in connection with the attempted purchase of firearms ’ and officials say that he would be able to quickly buy weapons			0
but the order will be lifted on sunday under rules introduced to protect the ‘ human rights ’ of terror suspects			1
this is despite a judge ruling that the man has been trained in terrorism and that his ‘ views and determination are unchanged ’			0
@entity21 is one of six fanatics who are due to be released from their t - pims by the end of this month			0
they also include a would - be suicide bomber involved in the liquid bomb plot to murder thousands by blowing up seven transatlantic planes			0
experts estimate the total bill for @entity33 and the police to keep tabs on the six suspects once their @entity35 restrictions are lifted could reach £ 20million a year			1
the cases will be raised in the @entity72 today by @entity74 ’s shadow home secretary , @entity73			0
she has attacked her @entity76 counterpart , @entity75 , for axing @entity74 ’s control order regime and replacing it with the weaker t - @entity78			2
miss @entity73 said : ‘ her decision to weaken terror controls means suspects described by the courts as highly dangerous only a year ago will now face no restrictions			1
’ @entity85 officials insist that , to comply with @entity74 ’s @entity87 , there was no option but to weaken the rules			2
under the old control order regime , there was no fixed time limit on how long a suspect could be monitored			2
but the orders were repeatedly challenged in the courts under the @entity87 , with terror suspects claiming their right to liberty , a fair trial and a family life had been infringed			1
these cases led to the introduction of @entity78 , which have a two - year time limit			0
believing that a terror suspect remains determined to carry out an attack in the @entity6 is not sufficient for an order to be renewed after two years			1
there must be new evidence			0
@entity74 , which has obtained new court papers relating to the threat posed by @entity21 and his fellow fanatics , said the @entity78 regime had left ministers with their hands tied			0
the court papers on @entity21 , who is guaranteed lifelong anonymity to protect his rights , show he was identified by the @entity33 as a leading figure in a network of @entity2 extremists based in @entity12			2
in 2004 , he attended meetings organised by the jailed fanatic @entity125 and has attended at least one of @entity125 ’s terrorist training camps in @entity9			0
in 2006 , he had extremist training in @entity18 before returning to @entity12 in 2009 , where he was ‘ involved in planning a terrorist attack on the @entity6 , probably involving firearms ’			2
when his @entity35 was renewed a year ago , the judge said : ‘ there remains a network			0
his views and determination are unchanged			0
’ in november 2008 , @entity28 terrorists killed 164 people in 12 co-ordinated shooting and bombing attacks across @entity5 , @entity142 ’s biggest city			0
last night , security minister @entity143 said : ‘ the police and @entity33 have been working for some time to put tailored plans in place to manage the risk posed by these individuals once their @entity35 restrictions are removed			1
