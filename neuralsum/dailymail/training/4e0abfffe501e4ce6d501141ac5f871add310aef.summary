by @entity0 incredible footage has emerged of a fish leaping out of the water and plucking a fast - flying swallow out of the air - an event believed to have never before been captured on film			1
while many fish are known to occasionally eat birds , such as sharks , piranhas , eels and pikes , they usually prey on swimming , floating or stationary birds near the waterline			2
there have been reports of the @entity19 tigerfish , a fierce predator with large teeth found in many rivers and lakes on the continent , leaping out of the water to eat low - flying birds , but the phenomenon has never been captured on film			1
it was taken at @entity44 , a lake on the @entity46 catchment in the @entity47 in @entity19 using a motion capture camera as part of a study by the @entity51 at the @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity19			1
the predatory behaviour has been reported by numerous biologists , but definitive proof has eluded them until now			2
the @entity58 reports : ' as far as is known , this is the first confirmed record of a freshwater fish preying on birds in flight			0
' bird food : the footage was taken by researchers from a @entity19 university the predatory behaviour has been reported by numerous biologists , but definitive proof has eluded them until now scientists believe the behaviour may have been adopted out of necessity because of limited food supplies in the tigerfish 's habitat			1
ironically , the tigerfish 's pursuit of its avian prey also makes it more vulnerable to the @entity76 , a common predator in the region			0
the report added : ' during the 15 day survey as many as 20 successful attempts by @entity83 ( @entity82 ) individuals were observed on a daily basis			0
' two predation strategies were displayed by @entity87			0
these included surface or sub-surface pursuits of @entity91 ( swallows ) , followed by aerial strikes , and direct aerial strikes initiated from deeper water			2

the swallow is flying low over the water when the predatory fish strikes
*astonishing* footage was taken at a lake in @entity19
