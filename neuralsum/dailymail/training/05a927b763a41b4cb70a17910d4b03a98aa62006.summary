the best side i ever faced were @entity2 ’s invincibles			1
they had quality all over the pitch , they were powerful and they hardly had any weaknesses			2
now @entity9 are starting to look just as strong			1
i do n’t know if @entity11 ’s team can go unbeaten , but when you look through the squad they have so many options in every position			1
if you want a war with them , they are up for the fight			2
if they want to open up the game , they ’ve got the pace and skill of @entity25 and his midfield mates			1
and if they want to sit and play on the counter , they ’ve got the speed and power of @entity32			2
@entity32 , here celebrating scoring @entity9 's second goal against @entity2 , has speed and power to burn and @entity25 ( right ) , bought down here for a penalty against @entity2 , epitomises their pace and skill hazard calmly puts aways the penalty conceded by @entity44 defender @entity43 @entity45 has struck up a deadly partnership with @entity32			1
he has already set up four of the striker ’s nine goals in the league			2
he does not look like a man nursing a hamstring injury and his goal showed in a split second what @entity9 are about			1
@entity45 picked the ball up like a quarterback in the pocket and sprayed an inch - perfect pass to @entity32			0
everyone knows what a powerhouse he is , but that finish showed he really does have everything			0
it was the kind of cute scoop you ’d expect from a midfield maestro , not a ferocious forward like @entity32			0
@entity32 's finish for @entity9 's second goal against @entity2 showed the finesse of a midfield maestro @entity9 are starting to resemble @entity74 's ( right ) @entity73 of 2003 - 04 , which included superstars such as @entity76 ( left ) and @entity77 ( centre ) , here in north @entity80 with the @entity82 trophy @entity83 was captain of a team with hardly any weaknesses , much like the current @entity9 side @entity76 , @entity87 ( second right ) and @entity89 ( right ) were important players for many seasons @entity94 , starting to make a mark at @entity93 , celebrates his goal against @entity96 on saturday @entity97 for @entity94 when i was at @entity99 at the end of my career , i remember seeing a young @entity94 play			1
the focus was on @entity104 and @entity105 but you could see his quality			0
but he was such a well - mannered lad you wondered if he had the drive to really kick on			0
after playing for @entity111 and getting his move to @entity93 , it ’s obvious that he does			1
now after such a quality goal , which our graphic below shows , he will feel more settled			2
he ’s not blessed with blistering pace but he ’s so good with both feet and can drop a shoulder to find space			0
now he has to go on and dominate games like he can			2
@entity123 ? he never left ! you could name an entire xi of top quality players who are suffering from a @entity128 hangover , but @entity129 has been getting more stick than most			1
he has not hit top gear yet — a bit like @entity133 — but i expect that goal against @entity136 to get the big man well and truly back into his stride			1
of course there ’s room for improvement but he ’s got so much quality and we ’ve still not seen him ping in a free - kick or penalty yet			0
do n’t worry about @entity129 , there ’s plenty more to come			1
could this @entity129 goal for @entity133 against @entity136 be the catalyst for a return to his best form ? time for swans to become lions the way @entity157 and @entity158 are playing , they are making it very difficult for @entity159 not to pick them for @entity111			1
they are scoring and making goals and offer so much pace out wide			0
@entity157 scored a classy goal a few weeks ago and again against @entity166 while @entity158 buzzes around causing teams problems			1
@entity159 has already called up their team - mate @entity168			0
maybe the two @entity171 wingers are next up			1
@entity171 's @entity157 scores another classy goal for @entity171 on saturday against @entity166 @entity174 @entity158 , taking on @entity166 's @entity173 , has been causing havoc for defences @entity177 , but not in goal @entity179 have a few things to sort out in their defence , but their goalkeeper is not one of them			1
@entity185 was excellent against @entity186 and his saves towards the end won his team the game			1
when i first saw him playing for @entity179 he looked six stone wet through			2
there was barely anything of him and i always thought he would n’t be strong enough to make it			0
@entity185 won the game for @entity179 over @entity186 with some incredible saves teams bullied him by whipping in crosses and packing the box to make life as uncomfortable as possible			1
he learnt from those experiences and he has improved dramatically			0
now he takes total command of his area and is easily one of the best goalkeepers in the @entity82			0
@entity179 still have a lot of work to do defensively , though			1
as good as @entity185 is , they ca n’t keep asking him to produce world - class saves			2
he saved the day against @entity186 , but for @entity179 there is plenty of work to be done			1
@entity179 manager @entity216 's terrific keeper just papers over the cracks in his inadequate defence @entity220 ' tidy transfers @entity220 did some good business in the transfer window but one signing who came in a bit under the radar was @entity227			1
he ’s made the step up from @entity229 but already looks so comfortable in a @entity220 shirt			0
i came from a lower level at @entity233 so know how difficult that transition can be , but he has made it look easy			0
he plays with confidence , is good on the ball and he ’s got a fine left foot , something every club is looking for			0
at 24 he might be a late developer , but he has made a solid start			0
@entity227 ( right ) , challenged here by @entity244 's @entity243 , has impressed since his move from @entity229 in their last three campaigns only one @entity247 player has scored 10 or more goals - @entity251 @entity251 celebrates one of his two goals against @entity254 in @entity247 's big 3 - 1 win @entity256 firing that 3 - 1 victory over @entity254 is a huge result for @entity247			2
@entity260 has been waiting a long time for a win and they badly needed it			2
part of the problem has been a lack of goals and that ’s because they lack a real out - and - out goalscorer			0
when i look at their squad the only natural goalscorer i see is @entity251			0
he has always shown a lot of potential but has never quite been consistent enough			0
the two goals on saturday should give him the confidence he needs to go on and become his team ’s go - to man for goals .			0

@entity2 's @entity73 hardly had weaknesses , much like today 's @entity9
@entity11 has the *luxury* of so many options in every position
they *'re* both up for war or can open teams up with finesse and speed
it 's time for @entity94 to go on and dominate game like i know he can
there is plenty more to come from @entity129 after @entity136 goal
@entity171 's @entity157 and @entity158 must be @entity111 *contenders*
@entity185 saved the day for @entity179 against @entity186 but @entity216 has plenty of work to do at the back
