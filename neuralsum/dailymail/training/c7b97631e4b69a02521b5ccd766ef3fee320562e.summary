a house that was sold in a state of rank squalor has been cleaned and put back on the market just six months later - for £ 10,000 more			1
the filthy three - bedroom semi-detached home in @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , was sold for £ 114,950 in march after being advertised on property search website @entity9			1
the photos of the house resembled a bombsite , with filthy dishes piled on sinks and counter-tops , floors stained and partially hidden by garbage and mountains of clothes heaped in every room			2
the property also boasted a ' family bathroom ' and a third bedroom ' bigger than your normal sized third bedroom ' as well as being just half - a - mile from @entity48 and local shops			2
the kitchen diner was described as featuring ' a range of wall and base units incorporating a one - and - a - half bowl stainless steel sink with drainer , integrated appliances to include oven , hob and microwave '			0
astonishingly - the property was viewed 14 times by prospective buyers and was on the market for one month before being bought for the full asking price in march			1
squalor : the living room was pictured online looking like a bombsite with rubbish piled everywhere - yet the property still attracted a buyer clean up : the latest advert shows a tidier living room - the house in @entity7 , @entity8 , is now on the market for £ 125,000 it was purchased by a property developer who hoped to renovate it and turn it into a luxury family home			1
but today it emerged that the house was for sale again and , in a sign of the rising housing market , had an asking price of £ 125,000 - a £ 10,000 increase in just six months			1
the buyer , who has not been identified , initially described the house as ' a palace '			0
but yesterday his love for the property seemed to have waned as updated pictures of the inside of the house looking tidier appeared on the @entity9 website			1
@entity97 : the bedroom was originally captured with piles of clothes obscuring the bed and drawers hanging open spilling their contents on to the hidden floor empty : the clothes have been taken away but the bedroom is far from welcoming with the door off its hinges and a shoddy - looking cabinet in the middle of the floor @entity112 , of @entity113 , said : ' the guy who bought it was a property developer but he only got as far as emptying all the rubbish out and then he ran out of time			1
' it 's not perfect , it needs a new roof , new windows , new central heating , new everything			0
it 's a massive challenge			0
' and someone who likes gardening			0
homes that need work get more attention			0
it needs everything doing , it needs gutting and starting again			0
' on @entity9 , the latest advertisement confesses : ' the property has featured in the @entity136 when the property was full of furniture and rubbish ( now removed )			2
the property will need a full refurbishment and is on the market due to the new owner not been able to complete the works			2
' it would suit someone with plenty of time on their hands and be able to restore the property to a liveable condition			0
the property is huge inside and should be viewed to appreciate the space on offer either as a family home or multi-room let property			0
' original advert : the post appeared on @entity9 in february with estate agent @entity36 optimistically describing the property as a ' period style ' house fresh on the market : the cleaner property has reappeared online with an asking price of £ 125,000 - £ 10,000 more than it was bought for in march on the latest @entity9 advert , it reads : ' the property would suit someone with plenty of time on their hands and be able to restore the property to a liveable condition '			1

home went on the market in february - appearing on property website @entity9 in a state of absolute filth
amazingly it was sold for its asking price of £ *115,000* to property developer who hoped to turn it into luxury home
but after six months he 's only cleared out the rubbish and cleaned the rooms , with the house still not ' liveable '
despite this - it 's now back on the market for £ 125,000 - with new @entity9 photos showing off house 's tidy rooms .
