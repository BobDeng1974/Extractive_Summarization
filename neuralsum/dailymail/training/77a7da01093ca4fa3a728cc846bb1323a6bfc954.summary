by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 23 march 2013 updated : 17:00 est , 23 march 2013 @entity1 : @entity2 works out from home it ’s 11.20am and @entity6 ’s personal trainer , @entity5 , is putting me through my paces at my apartment in @entity11 ’s @entity10			1
down on my mat , i ’m guided through a series of leg lifts to tone and hone my inner thighs – similar to the kind of moves @entity18 had @entity6 do to get in shape for her @entity21 - winning role in @entity22			1
it ’s part of a workout that @entity26 , a former dancer with the @entity28 , calls @entity29 – which is also popular with her other high - profile clients , actresses @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity35 ’s secret model @entity33			1
my laptop studio as the burn begins to kick in , i can hear groans from other women			1
no – i ’m not hosting a class at home , i have logged on to @entity26 ’s website , @entity43 , and joined one of her classes via my laptop			1
when we finish , @entity26 leans into her webcam – which gives me a full view of her airy space in @entity54 ’s @entity53 where the live class is in session			1
‘ how are you doing @entity0 ? ’ she asks			1
i give her a thumbs - up – even though my leg feels as if it ’s about to go into spasm			1
@entity26 has been training clients remotely since 2008 , when she was working with @entity6			1
‘ she was amazing for my business , but at the same time it meant i travelled with her a lot , ’ says @entity26			1
‘ i did n’t want to leave my other clients hanging , so i bought a laptop and started training people over @entity69			1
’ when she opened her studio , she developed the software to allow people to join her classes online , too			1
a subscription costs £ 185 per month or it ’s £ 23 a class			2
@entity77 ‘ bye - bye gym , hello convenience , ’ says the home page on wello.co , another site offering digital workouts			2
having launched last summer with remote , one - on - one personal training sessions , it began offering classes – open to up to five people at a time – last month			2
here , you can find anything from yoga to full - on boot camp sessions , and the following weekend , i try an hour - long cardio circuits class			2
soon i get an email from @entity95 , the instructor , asking me and the other girls who ’ve signed up if we have any equipment she can incorporate into our workout			2
it turns out we all own a set of dumbbells			2
ballet beautiful : a webcam class from the website so you can take your classes at home in the end , one of the other girls drops out and so @entity110 – who is based in @entity111 – and i get @entity95 to ourselves			0
jumping around my living room with my dumbbells , my eyes on my computer screen where i can see @entity95 in one window and @entity110 in another , is a bit like doing a workout dvd – but better			0
left to my own devices , i might have been tempted to sit out some of the tougher moves , but with the camera on me i am too embarrassed to give up so i power on through			0
by the end of the class , i ’ve got a proper sweat on – just like if i ’d worked out at the gym			0
but for a fraction of the price			0
an individual class costs £ 6.50 , while a one - on - one session with a personal trainer is between £ 25 and £ 130 , depending on who you choose			0
@entity137 an even better deal can be found at another site called fitnessglo.com			0
for £ 8 a month you get unlimited access to hundreds of prerecorded workout videos , ranging in duration from ten to 45 minutes , and covering every kind of workout under the sun. it ’s like having your own fitness dvd library , and while you do n’t get the benefit of personal instruction , it beats them all for convenience – you really can log on wherever and whenever			0
i try a 30 - minute cardio athletic circuits class – the perfect quick fitness fix on another deadline - heavy day			0
all this does n’t even begin to mention the ease with which you can find fitness instruction by watching videos uploaded by trainers to @entity163			0
so will i be handing in my gym membership and switching to digital workouts instead ? probably not			0
for me , you ca n’t beat the energy you get in a live class , with the teacher yelling instructions over a pumping soundtrack and 20 other people going for it on all sides			0
but on those days when time ’s extra tight , i will log on .			0
