a new advertisement campaign telling men to ' man up , put on an apron ' in order to ' give mums a night off ' is under fire for pushing an outdated and sexist message			1
the intention behind @entity10 's television and @entity12 ads appear to have been to send up sexism , stating : ' there are more women in @entity17 's workforce today than ever before but men are still not putting on an apron and doing their share of cooking '			1
however it clearly backfired , with social media users taking to @entity24 and @entity12 to criticise the campaign , dubbing it ' sexist ' and an ' embarrassment '			1
but we know it ai n't easy			0
so we 've developed the world 's first cooking website designed just for blokes			0
with a little encouragement , we might be able to get yours to man up and put an apron on before you know it , ' the website states			1
recipe names include the likes of ' your big pork balls ' , with a glossary definition for the words ' recipe book ' being ' the thing your wife stands on to reach things '			0
one of the instruction for a @entity33 recipe states : ' throw it in a 170 degree oven and watch a @entity36 of women 's tennis ( roughly 30 minutes ) ' while the other instructions measure time in how long it takes to drink a beer - 15 minutes , according to the ad			0
it also features a difficulty metre for recipes , with ' super easy ' represented by ' like burping after a beer ' , and ' challenging ' represented by ' like remembering your missus birthday '			0

' by the way @entity91 all the men in whanau cook extremely well so your sexist representation harms both women and men			2
it 's 2015 not 1950 ! ' a @entity24 user wrote			2
' i actually really like the idea of promoting recipes to men who do n't cook but no @entity91 , no ' , another person tweeted			0
a spokesperson for @entity91 told @entity107 that the sexist criticism were only a minority view			2
' from the 370 000 people who have been exposed to the campaign we have only received a very small 24 @entity12 criticisms that the campaign is sexist , some twitter criticism , one email and a comment from one marketing professor			1
' there have been 71 000 video views and continued and increased support of our campaign by the 8339 people who follow the @entity12 page			2
