referee : @entity80 6 @entity81 : @entity30 stadium : @entity28 's the home side were already cruising four goals ahead when they added four goals in 16 minutes of devastation to annihilate the visitors			1
only two teams have ever scored more in a single @entity89 game ; @entity90 hit nine past @entity91 in 1995 and @entity92 did the same against @entity93 in 2009			2
but this result added @entity17 's @entity3 into the pantheon of great performances			1
even the @entity3 manager admitted he was surprised by the result			2
' i 'm still a little bit in shock , ' @entity17 said afterwards			2
' that is not a normal result			0
i was surprised after 20 minutes about the score ; 2 - 0 up and we did n't start the game well			1
@entity4 were dominating and we had problems			2
' the first 20 minutes it was very flat			0
but that 's football and sometimes you 're surprised how the game is changing			0
if you 're asking me after 15 mins if it will be an easy win my answer would be no. ' in the end we played great football , we scored great goals and it was a great afternoon			2
' the tone was set for the afternoon when @entity23 scored the own goal of the season in only the 11th minute			1
@entity4 's defender can surely not have struck a sweeter volley and the ball flew into the bottom - right corner past his own goalkeeper @entity36			1
@entity124 was momentarily stunned into silence			0
an incredulous @entity76 was the most shocked			0
' even if you watch that 20 times you do n't know how it can happen , ' the @entity4 manager said			2
the home side doubled their lead on 18 minutes when @entity132 ran down the left flank and sent in a low cross for @entity30 , completely free , to continue his tremendous form with a tap in			2
then , with similarly sloppy marking , it was three on 37 minutes			0
@entity38 made a late run into the box and was not picked up , @entity52 picked him out with a clipped ball from inside the box on the left and he forced the ball in			1
substitute @entity61 added to @entity4 's embarrassment by sending the ball into his own net in the 62nd minute			1
the unfortunate @entity148 goalkeeper picks the ball out of his net for the third time while @entity49 wheels away in celebration @entity49 , @entity52 and @entity45 celebrate their side 's third goal , which game eight minutes before half time @entity4 's player sit dejected on the floor after @entity61 puts the ball into his own net , it was their second own goal of the match the 29 - year - old former @entity163 forward adds his second , and @entity3 's fifth , goal of the afternoon summer signing @entity52 jumps into the arms of @entity148 forward @entity30 after scoring his side 's sixth goal former @entity172 man @entity50 celebrates scoring @entity3 's seventh of the afternoon second - half substitute @entity47 completes the rout by scoring his side 's eighth , and final , goal of the afternoon 04/03/1995 : @entity90 9 - 0 @entity91 22/11/2009 : @entity92 9 - 1 @entity93 19/09/1999 : @entity179 8 - 0 @entity180 09/05/2010 : @entity181 8 - 0 @entity93 23/12/2012 : @entity181 8 - 0 @entity182 18/10/2014 : @entity3 8 - 0 @entity4 @entity30 's shot was saved by @entity36 but the ball squirmed into the path of @entity61 , then squirmed between his feet , then squirmed over the line			1
if only @entity76 had pointed his players in the right direction			0
it took only another seven minutes before @entity3 made it five			0
this time @entity30 made no mistake with his shot , running on to @entity52 's through ball and sending a the ball across goal into the bottom left corner			1
that was his sixth goal in eight @entity89 games since signing in the summer , celebrating in fitting style his player of the month award and scoring on his @entity34 debut during the international break			1
@entity3 were as relentless as @entity4 were shocking and added another two goals in the space of a minute			1
@entity36 played his part in @entity4 's comedy show , passing the ball straight to @entity52 who sent it back past him and into the open net on 78 minutes			1
@entity77 pulls off an acrobatic foul on opposition striker @entity214 during their match at @entity28 's @entity77 and @entity59 argue with referee @entity80 while @entity217 forward @entity69 watches on central midfielder @entity132 clears the ball while former @entity219 and @entity37 man @entity64 watches on @entity3 fans watch on as their side complete the sixth biggest win in @entity89 history the electronic scoreboard at @entity28 's shows the full extent of the horror for @entity4 's travelling fans the round - trip from @entity4 to @entity3 and back is a staggering 653.4 miles , which would take the away supporters 11 hours @entity66 tumbles to the ground after @entity3 captain @entity43 puts in a heavy challenge on the former @entity93 man then almost straight from the kick off substitute @entity50 fired first - time past the @entity4 goalkeeper			1
and with four minutes remaining @entity52 crossed low into the box for another substitute , @entity47 , to run in and place the ball into the net			2
the result well and truly dispelled the myth that the winner of the manager of the month award goes on to have a poor result in their next game			0
after the accolade was picked up by @entity17 for leading @entity3 to the top three in the opening part of this season , @entity181 boss @entity246 reminded everyone of the that curse ahead of the weekend 's fixtures			1
opposition managers @entity76 and @entity17 greet each other before their @entity89 meeting @entity69 attempts to reduce the deficit but is surrounded by @entity43 , @entity48 and @entity258 defender @entity44 @entity4 striker @entity68 at full stretch to reach the ball while @entity42 attempts to close him down @entity30 , who was recently given the @entity89 player of the month award for september , takes a shot against @entity4 @entity36 endured a torrid afternoon , conceding more goals in a single match than he has ever done before @entity266 miles @entity3 118.4 73.6 @entity38 90 12.5 7.8 @entity52 90 12.3 7.6 @entity48 90 12.1 7.5 @entity4 112.8 70.1 @entity63 90 12.5 7.7 @entity77 90 11.0 6.9 @entity23 90 10.8 6.7 that he is even mentioning @entity17 says a great deal about how much of an impression @entity3 , in third , are making			1
' maybe i thank @entity246 for that , ' @entity17 joked			0
' he gave my players motivation			0
i look forward to playing @entity181			0
' the game could have been different had referee @entity80 awarded @entity4 a first - half penalty when @entity69 was played through on goal by @entity77 , knocked the ball past the on - rushing @entity41 then tumbled over the @entity3 goalkeeper			1
it was still only 2 - 0 at that point			1
' if the ref did his job , it 's a penalty and a red card and maybe 2 - 1 and then we 're talking about a different game , ' @entity76 explained			0
a @entity4 fan who had made the 650 - mile round trip , across the whole country and back , was caught on camera sobbing by the end			2
no wonder , it was the first time they had conceded eight since september 1982 against @entity293			0
' i ca n't explain what happened , ' @entity76 added			0
' i will let the players explain to you , maybe they will have better words			0
' it 's going to be a difficult week			0
the players who are on the pitch next week are going to do something about it			0
' @entity3 's impressive form this season has seen them rise to third in the @entity89 table , just one point behind the champions @entity69 and former @entity310 winger @entity67 prepare to kick off , something they did nine times at @entity28 's @entity17 proved there was no letting up after winning september 's @entity89 manager of the month award			1
