shot through the eye by an arrow , he died at the hands of four @entity5 knights brutally dismembering his body - or so almost 950 years of history dictates			1
but archaeologists are now claiming @entity9 may have survived the @entity10 , and lived out his years before quietly dying of old age			1
the alternative version of events , put forward in a 12th century document housed in the @entity15 , discounts the @entity5 ' portrayal of his death in the @entity18			1
according to the @entity18 , @entity9 was killed by four @entity5 knights after being shot through the eye with an arrow at the @entity10 in 1066 ( pictured ) excavators will carry out a scan of the grounds of @entity24 in @entity25 ( pictured ) where @entity9 is thought to be buried the artwork , long considered an accurate depiction of the @entity28 , shows @entity9 clutching at an arrow in his eye as four @entity5 knights hack at his body			1
but now a team of historians , who discovered the remains of @entity35 in a municipal car park in @entity37 in 2012 , are eager to dispel the long - accepted story			2
@entity39 and @entity40 , whose efforts were applauded around the world for the discovery , will carry out an underground scan of @entity46 at @entity24 in @entity25 , the supposed site of @entity9 's tomb , to look for his remains			1
@entity9 is thought to have been killed in the 1066 battle ' we have the @entity5 story put through the @entity18 – the @entity54 story is a different one , ' said @entity56 , a historian in @entity24			1
' you put things together and it begins to build a picture that is quite solid			0
if everything backs you up in history , you should look at it			2
' you should n't just leave it , ' the 64 - year - old told the @entity67			0
' i am convinced @entity9 survived the @entity10			1
' if we find the complete remains of an old man in his late 70 's with scarring to his temple from a battle wound then we need to do a dna test			2
' our understanding of this particular period of @entity54 history would have to change			0
' fronting £ 2,000 for the project , mr @entity56 will oversee a scan of the church 's grounds on tuesday roughly 15 yards from his alleged tomb at the @entity84			2
if anything is picked up by the scan , @entity85 will have to apply to the secretary of state for permission to excavate the site			0
however members of the @entity92 think it is unlikely they will find anything of interest as the site has been disturbed by building works over the years			0
the remains of @entity35 were found in a car park in @entity37 in 2012			0
it was the site of the lost @entity102 church where the royal had been buried following his death in the @entity105			0
the remains of @entity35 ( pictured ) were discovered in a municipal car park in @entity37 in 2012			0
