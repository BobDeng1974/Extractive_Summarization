@entity0 was back on our screens on tuesday night , delivering the kind of frank appraisals he won admiration for during his initial stint as an @entity8 pundit			1
his straight - forward assessments were that : this current @entity11 side can not be considered great until they win trophies ; @entity13 should have been on the front foot for @entity16 ’s goal ; and @entity18 ’s defenders struggled to deal with simple crosses from @entity20 all evening			1
no spectacular insight , and hardly cause to cower behind the sofa , but it is clear his natural demand for excellence remains an underlying constant , two and a half months after his sudden departure from @entity27			1
@entity28 , whose tongue can deliver similar sharp critique , might decide that chapter worth studying as he plans his own manual for guiding @entity27 to safety			1
@entity0 ( left ) pictured at the @entity34 on tuesday night alongside fellow pundit @entity35 @entity28 gestures during an @entity27 training session at @entity37 on tuesday @entity0 left @entity27 after clashes with senior players , mainly over training intensity and his high standards towards performance			1
while some in the squad liked his style , his words overall carried too much venom to prove successful			1
ills can not always be cured by a deluge of bitter medicine			2
sometimes the pills must be palatable			2
@entity53 professionals should be capable of engaging in robust discussions on football matters , and any @entity27 player who feels beyond criticism this season needs to take one look at the table			1
but when a group is low on confidence a mix of tactics might require employment			2
this is the subtlety of management			2
it is why sir @entity69 occasionally switched off his hairdryer			2
it is in this context that it is worth visiting @entity28 ’s answer from his monday press conference to a question about his honesty in regards to player appraisals			1
@entity28 looks on as he takes his first training session since becoming the new @entity27 manager @entity0 suddenly quit as @entity27 assistant manager at the end of november ‘ one thing i can guarantee if i 'm going to be guilty of something it will be honesty , ’ he readily agreed before adding a caveat			1
‘ if they do well they will be told , if they do n't do well they will also be told and told why			2
you have to be constructive			2
‘ it ca n't be because of a referee 's decision or if someone scores a 40 - yarder that everyone 's c * * *			2
that ai n’t the case			2
‘ you have to talk to them			2
some people might have played well and need to be patted on the back			0
some people need a kick up the backside at the right time and i need to be that person to be able to do that			0
’ @entity28 famously called out his @entity111 players for lacking guts and character after a 4 - 0 defeat to @entity11 , a public dressing down viewed in quarters as too far			1
‘ watch this space ! ’ he grinned when asked if he would use similar language at @entity27			1
you hope , for his and the club ’s sake , he does not need to go there			0
a deeper guide of his mentality presented itself when probed about the merits of all players in his squad			0
he voluntarily brought up his relationship with @entity130 midfielder @entity129 , who saw his game time limited following that humbling at @entity133			0
discordant , is one way to describe their dynamic			0
@entity27 boss @entity28 shouts instructions during training in @entity138 on tuesday @entity28 speaks to his players during his first training session at @entity37 ‘ everyone has got an important part to play , ’ said @entity141			1
‘ there wo n’t be anyone who is not included in my plans			0
it ’s a fresh start for everyone			0
‘ whether the previous manager liked them or he did n’t , it does n’t matter to me			1
they need to prove themselves on the training field			0
i need to see them train well and see what they produce			0
' it ’s a jigsaw you put together when you pick a team and you look at the opposition			0
you have to leave out a lot of players doing that but that does n’t mean they ’re finished			0
you might leave them out for two weeks and they start getting a bit disgruntled but it does n’t mean they ’re finished			0
‘ you can bring them back because there might be that time at the end of the season when they need to come back in and do a job			0
@entity129 was a good example of that at @entity111 against @entity27 , the last game of last season			1
everyone down south was talking about how i had a big fall out with him			0
@entity28 poses for the cameras as he is unveiled as the new @entity27 manager on monday @entity28 is in good spirits as he speaks to journalists during a press conference on monday ‘ i never burnt any bridges with any players			1
there was always a chance that i would bring him back and put him in the team and i brought him back for that game because i was worried about the counter attacking threat of ( @entity197 ) @entity196			0
‘ i pushed the full backs on and played @entity129 in the pivot role and he did the job for me and got a standing ovation coming off after 60 minutes			0
‘ you do n’t burn bridges with players			0
you ca n’t afford to do that			0
they ’re paid a lot of money by the football club and it ’s an asset you ’re pouring down the drain			0
’ @entity28 spent monday evening watching @entity27 ’s under - 21 side lose 3 - 0 to @entity210 at the @entity211			1
@entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 were among those featuring in a disjointed performance that suggested individual efforts were being made to impress the new boss			1
@entity219 celebrates after scoring for @entity27 in their @entity221 victory against @entity222 @entity141 ( centre ) celebrates after watching @entity219 score for @entity27 in the @entity221 fifth - round match as an exercise in assessing his assets , @entity28 may have left underwhelmed			1
from this point he needs to work out how much he should ruffle feathers , how often to offer a coaxing pat. whatever his call , whether burning bridges or building bridges , the only bridge of concern to @entity27 is the one connecting them to @entity53 football for the 2015 - 16 season			1
on that basis , @entity0 provides an interesting signpost .			1
