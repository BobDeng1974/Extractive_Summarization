police were last night investigating a complaint by the son of an elderly woman who died in hospital after her food and fluids were allegedly withdrawn without his agreement			1
@entity8 says his 83 - year - old mother @entity9 had her intravenous drip removed even though she was ‘ far from being dead ’			1
he claims she died after being placed on the @entity11 – a controversial @entity13 process used across the country under which the dying are helped in their final hours			1
shocked : @entity8 , 55 , of @entity16 , says he visited his mother @entity9 , 83 , ( pictured aged 45 in 1973 ) in hospital to find that she had been isolated and that the intravenous drip had been removed mr @entity8 said that there was ‘ overwhelming evidence of wrongdoing ’ by doctors in his mother ’s case			1
he wants police to consider whether this ‘ extremely cruel ’ treatment amounted to attempted murder			1
the case has led to a fresh wave of concern over the use of the @entity11			1
the older people ’s group saga branded it the ‘ lack of care pathway ’ while a campaign group suggested that in some cases its use amounted to euthanasia			2
mr @entity8 , 55 , a @entity42 engineer , went to police after his mother was deprived of food and fluid for 30 hours while in @entity47 in @entity48			1
she had been referred to the hospital from her care home with a urinary tract infection			1
when he arrived at the hospital on march 14 , he found that his mother , although weak , was ‘ far from being dead ’			1
she was conscious and smiling			2
doctors advised her family to return to their homes and said they would be notified if her condition worsened			2
location : mr @entity8 has made a formal complaint to the @entity13 that doctors at the @entity47 in @entity48 ( pictured ) used the @entity11 to try to hasten his mother 's death deliberately but when mr @entity8 visited the next day he found mrs @entity64 ’s food and fluid tubes had been removed			1
he said medical notes showed she had been placed on the @entity11			2
‘ the effect on me was equivalent to walking into an intensive care unit to discover a patient has been disconnected from their life support machine and the machine removed , ’ he said ‘ i did not notice any change in my mother ’s condition from the previous day and was alarmed that she was cut off from any means of sustenance			1
’ mrs @entity64 was removed from the @entity11 after 30 hours but died two weeks later			1
her son , who lives in @entity80 , @entity16 , said : ‘ to deprive my mother , conscious and aware of my presence , of all means of sustenance appeared to me to be extremely cruel			1
i had the impression that it had been decided to hasten her demise			2
i believe that the evidence of wrongdoing against my mother is overwhelming			1
’ the @entity11 was developed in the @entity90 during the 1990s with the aim of increasing the comfort of the dying and sparing those in their last hours of life from pain and the trauma of useless and invasive treatment			1
first used at the @entity101 in @entity11 , it has spread widely through the @entity13 following the decision to recommend it to hospitals by the @entity104 in 2004			2
the pathway is designed to come into operation when doctors believe it is impossible for a patient to recover and death is imminent			2
last summer professor @entity111 , a consultant neurologist , said that 29 per cent of @entity13 deaths now involve the @entity11 , a figure which suggests around 130,000 a year			2
on average , a patient dies 33 hours after entering the @entity11 , he said			2
once patients are in the system , treatment aimed at their recovery is withdrawn , and instead medical efforts are concentrated on trying to increase comfort and ease pain			1
among the causes of controversy is the perception that patients on the @entity11 are routinely sedated with drugs and deprived of food and fluids by tube , which critics say is cruel and likely to cause death rapidly			1
there have also been claims that it is used to free up beds			2
artificial nutrition and hydration has been considered treatment in legal terms since a landmark @entity142 court decision in 1993			1
defenders of the system say it spares patients suffering and pain			0
last month a ‘ consensus statement ’ in support of the @entity11 by medical colleges and charities said no patient should be consigned to the @entity11 without the involvement of at least two doctors			0
carers and families should always be involved in decisions about patients ’ care			0
a spokesman for @entity161 said it did not discuss individual cases			0
@entity16 police confirmed that mr @entity8 has made a complaint			1
last summer a hospital consultant said the @entity11 had become an assisted death pathway , killing more than 100,000 patients a year , and that it was being used to free beds in wards and get rid of difficult patients			1
professor @entity111 , a consultant neurologist for @entity173 and @entity174 at @entity175 , told a conference that it is not scientifically possible to predict if a patient will die within days			0
yesterday , after details of the @entity64 case emerged , campaigners spoke of their fears about the @entity11			0
@entity183 , spokesman for the @entity185 anti-euthanasia pressure group , said : ‘ we have heard from a large number of people who have lost relatives			0
‘ we believe this is euthanasia			0
there is growing evidence that one factor involved is that using the @entity11 saves hospitals money			0
’ dr @entity195 , director of the @entity197 organisation which provides care at home to thousands of frail and vulnerable elderly people , said : ‘ it would be more appropriate to call it the @entity11 lack of care pathway			0
‘ the families involved are usually in no position to speak for themselves			0
it is really important that their families are properly informed throughout the process			0
‘ this is such a serious issue and it is likely to affect so many people that medical staff must surely want to keep families informed , if only to prevent incidents like the @entity64 case			0
’ dr @entity195 added : ‘ there may be very good reasons for putting a patient on the @entity11 , but that is not to excuse doing it without explaining that to their loved ones			0
the families can not understand what is happening and have to suffer the consequences			0
’ last summer , health minister @entity225 told peers that ‘ some people who have been on the @entity11 have received poor care ’ , adding that ‘ the @entity11 is not of itself a guarantor of best - quality care ’			0
instead , the decision to put a patient on the @entity11 has become ‘ a self - fulfilling prophecy ’			0
commenting after professor @entity111 made his comments , a @entity236 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity11 is not euthanasia and we do not recognise these figures			0
@entity242 is recommended by the @entity104 and has overwhelming support from clinicians – at home and abroad – including the @entity246			0
‘ a patient ’s condition is monitored at least every four hours and , if a patient improves , they are taken off the @entity11 and given whatever treatments best suit their new needs			0
