by @entity0 published : 02:47 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 04:40 est , 23 july 2012 silence : @entity2 , 42 , has accepted a confidential payout and signed a gagging order a former @entity5 has been given a payout by the @entity7 after claiming she suffered sexual discrimination in the @entity9			1
chief petty officer @entity2 , 42 , claimed she was passed over for promotion because she refused to go to sea after rules were changed to allow women on warships			1
after two years of legal battles , @entity16 , who served at @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , has now accepted a confidential payout and signed a gagging order			0
the @entity7 's move has killed off the threat of a legal precedent being set which may have led to dozens more lawsuits costing taxpayers millions of pounds			2
@entity16 chose to retain non-seagoing status when the rules were changed to allow women on warships in 1993			1
around 70 per cent of @entity32 opted for this status and were assured at the time that it would not harm their promotion prospects			1
@entity37 , who was made an mbe in 2001 , felt she was the best candidate for promotion to warrant officer when she went before a promotion board in 2008 as the only female candidate			0
but she did not get the job and took the navy to an employment tribunal			0
that ruled the navy discriminated against her on two grounds - directly because she was a woman and indirectly because she had non-seagoing status			1
the navy appealed against the ruling in december 2010 but lost the part of the appeal relating to discrimination against her non-seagoing status			1
it did , however , win the right for a re-hearing of evidence that @entity16 was directly discriminated against by members of the navy 's promotions board solely because she was a woman			0
@entity18 where chief petty officer @entity2 was denied promotion because of her non-seagoing status fearing a potential wave of litigation from other ex-wrens , the @entity7 spent £ 126,000 fighting the rulings , but the case has now been dropped			1
a @entity9 spokeswoman said : ' we are pleased this long - running case has now been concluded by mutual agreement			0
' it has been a challenging time for both the @entity7 and ms @entity2 who gave many years of loyal and high quality service			2
' we do wish ms @entity2 and her family well for the future			0
' ms @entity2 was unable to comment because of the confidentiality order she signed			0
the navy said it will now review the case to see if ' appropriate lessons ' can be learned			0
@entity87 and employment law expert @entity86 said : ' this looks like a good result for the @entity7 ' @entity90 is always a risky and uncertain process and if the @entity7 had gone back to the tribunal again and it went against them it would have set a case law precedent that could have caused them a problem			2

@entity98 ruled she was discriminated against when going for promotion
wrens who retained non-seagoing status after rules changed were assured it would not harm their prospects
@entity7 spent £ 126,000 fighting the rulings , fearing litigation from other ex-wrens
