by @entity0 last updated at 10:23 am on 21st september 2011 school dinner ladies , as well as hundreds of carers and cleaners , have won an epic battle for equal pay			1
thousands of female workers could now win payouts after @entity9 city council agreed on an undisclosed out - of - court settlement with 900 women			1
the individual payments are thought to range from around ‘ a couple of hundred pounds to tens of thousands ’ , a union source has said			2
payout on the menu : 900 dinner ladies and woman carers and cleaners have won an epic battle for equal pay ( library image ) if the council had gone to court and lost , they would have had to pay £ 20million in compensation			1
the settlement came after unions claimed that woman workers had been discriminated against by the council for years			1
female workers had also been excluded from a bonus scheme which employees in predominately male roles such as street cleaners and gardeners had received			1
they also argued that their pay packet was far less than their male counterparts , in some cases by up to £ 10,000 per year			0
@entity39 , from the union @entity40 , told the @entity41 : ‘ they could have settled for probably half what it is going to cost them now			0
’ he added that he was ‘ disappointed ’ that is had taken three years for the council to finally settle			1
one council care worker of 24 years , @entity49 , said : ‘ this is great news			2
a lot of people will be really happy			0
compensation : @entity9 city council ( pictured ) agreed on an undisclosed out - of - court settlement with 900 women ‘ it was one of the first test cases to go to tribunal in 2005 and it is something that has been a very long time coming			1
‘ we stuck with this case because there were a lot of inequalities			0
men were being paid more and getting bonuses			0
’ @entity69 ’s director of human resources , @entity68 , would not reveal the amount of compensation , but did confirm that a settlement had been agreed on			0
‘ the terms of the settlement are confidential so we will not be making further comment suffice to say we are content this has now been settled ’ , she said			0
general secretary of @entity40 , @entity78 , told the @entity79 last night that 40,000 similar cases around the country had been awaiting the court hearing			0
he said : ‘ it makes sense the council has seen fit to pay women fairly			2
’ the council , which needs to save £ 220million in the next four years , says there will be no impact on finances due to the settlement and council taxpayers will not be affected .			2
