@entity0 hosts @entity1 made it through to the semi-finals for the first time in their history but the game ended in carnage in @entity9 on saturday night			1
the @entity10 beat @entity12 thanks in part to a controversial stoppage - time penalty , which took the game to extra-time			1
referee @entity17 was then chased from the pitch by the @entity20 players after @entity21 had won the game for the home side , with one player aiming a kick at the official			1
as the teams left the field missiles were thrown from the crowd at the visiting players , one of whom picked up a bottle and hurled it back into the crowd			0
it had been a bad - tempered game from the start , with @entity12 ’s play violent and @entity17 completely unable to manage the occasion			2
but for a game lacking in any flow or quality , it more than made up for it with late drama and a spine - tingling atmosphere			2
@entity1 's defender @entity66 ( c ) argues with @entity12 's players at the end of the match with seconds of stoppage time remaining and the hosts trailing 1 - 0 , @entity70 went down under a seemingly innocuous challenge in the box			1
but , inexplicably , a penalty was awarded to take the game to the additional half hour			2
the 40 - 000 fans packed into the @entity9 were excitable and raucus long @entity17 pointed for the last - gasp spot kick , and when @entity21 stepped up to convert in from the spot it felt like they might bring the stadium down			1
but that was nothing compared to the noise when the same man , once a trainee at @entity86 , curled in a beauty of a free kick from 25 yards in extra time			1
despite the controversial decision , there was little sympathy for @entity12 , a side set up to contain rather than create , and whose energies were as much directed at kicking their opponents as the ball			0
@entity12 's defender @entity98 and @entity1 's defender @entity99 ( right ) come to blows indeed , had @entity17 not completely lost control of the game long before the equalizer , the @entity20 could have been reduced to 10 men , or even fewer			1
that the game ended with a brawl including both dugouts and several players was absolutely no surprise			1
@entity12 had gone ahead through @entity110 , but the striker was one of those who was fortunate to be on the pitch when he converted @entity115 ’s cross in the 70th minute			0
@entity110 had lunged , dangerously and unnecessarily , at the @entity118 - @entity117 keeper @entity116 just minutes before scoring what had looked to be the winning goal			0
aside from his goal @entity12 created next to nothing , @entity116 making one serious save , and even then it was exaggerated , perhaps for the camera , or perhaps to life his own boredom			0
at the other end , for all their nice interplay , the home side did n’t make too many clear - cut chances			0
@entity1 's midfielder @entity131 challenges @entity12 's midfielder @entity132 before things got heated @entity135 ’s @entity134 might have scored when he went through on goal , only to be denied by @entity137 , but for the most part it was a game of high tempers rather than high - tempo football			2
that mattered very little though , after @entity21 ’s stunning double			0
like the tournament itself – moved from @entity147 at the last minute - we may not have arrived at the end point in an ideal manner , but few could deny it was the right one			0
but it will be overshadowed by the shameful scenes that followed , with @entity12 in particular unlikely to escape serious punishment			0
@entity1 's @entity154 celebrates after winning their @entity0 quarter final @entity1 's midfielder @entity21 ( bottom - r ) celebrates with teammates after scoring their second goal			2
