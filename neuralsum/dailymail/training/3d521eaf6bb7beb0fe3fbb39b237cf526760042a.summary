@entity0 took a giant stride towards the @entity3 quarter - finals by flooring @entity5 heavyweights @entity4 at @entity6			1
last year 's @entity8 runners - up moved to the top of @entity10 by delivering arguably their most complete performance of the season , cruising home 33 - 10			0
wings @entity13 and @entity15 scored first - half tries , before @entity15 added a second touchdown after the break , while @entity19 reminded @entity21 head coach @entity20 of his quality ahead of next week 's @entity24 squad announcement by kicking four penalties and three conversions for an 18 - point haul			1
@entity19 reminded @entity21 head coach @entity20 of his quality ahead of the @entity24 @entity28 of @entity4 ( bottom ) is tackled by @entity0 ' @entity13 ( left ) at @entity6 on saturday @entity31 giants @entity30 remain favourites to win the group - they host @entity0 on sunday week - but it is probable that one of three best runners - up spots in terms of last - eight qualification will be filled by either club			1
twice @entity8 champions @entity4 , though , are staring at pool - stage elimination - barring a mathematical miracle - for only a second time in the last 17 seasons , even if they defeat @entity48 visitors @entity47 in bonus - point fashion next weekend			1
centre @entity51 's late try , plus an @entity54 conversion and penalty , could not mask @entity4 deficiencies , as @entity0 overpowered them up front and won an overwhelming majority of midfield collisions			0
and while @entity4 's @entity8 fate looks sealed , @entity0 appear well equipped to make another assault on silverware , even if they did not collect a bonus point their dominance deserved			0
@entity65 of @entity0 builds up some momentum as he breaks through the @entity4 defence saracens were boosted by the return of @entity21 centre @entity70 for his first appearance since suffering a calf muscle injury on test duty in late november , while skipper @entity75 recovered from a knock to pack down alongside second - row partner @entity77			2
but @entity0 suffered a late blow when prolific try - scoring wing @entity80 was ruled out with back trouble , so @entity13 deputised and @entity82 featured on the bench			0
and @entity4 's @entity86 international scrum - half @entity84 missed out due to a neck problem just three weeks before this season 's @entity24 kick - off , which meant a start for @entity91			2
@entity0 made the early running , setting up camp inside @entity4 's 22 with @entity15 prominent , and they deservedly took a ninth - minute lead through an angled @entity19 penalty			1
@entity54 of @entity4 ( bottom ) is tackled by @entity19 of @entity0 ( centre ) in saturday 's encounter @entity4 struggled to handle a powerful @entity0 scrum , and it was no surprise when that imposing set - piece platform provided the foundation for an opening try midway through the first half			1
once again , @entity0 found themselves within striking distance of @entity4 's line , and they made it count as scrum - half @entity108 fired possession wide to @entity19 , and three passes later via @entity15 and full - back @entity112 , @entity13 crossed unopposed			1
it was simple rugby executed in majestic fashion by @entity0 , and @entity19 's conversion gave the home side a 10 - 0 lead that their territorial control warranted			2
and @entity4 's early troubles showed no sign of abating as their often - influential number eight @entity125 limped off 12 minutes before half - time , before a second @entity19 penalty put @entity0 13 points clear , with @entity4 offering little to suggest they would recover from such a deficit			1
a @entity54 penalty opened @entity4 's account as the interval approached , and it sparked a temporary spell of dominance before @entity0 were handed back the initiative when the visitors spilled possession in midfield			0
@entity140 of @entity0 looks focussed as his side cruised to a 33 - 10 victory against the @entity143 @entity4 then conceded a penalty on halfway , and @entity0 prospered after opting to run the ball back , with @entity13 sending a brilliant kick behind the @entity5 side 's defence before @entity15 reacted quickest to touch down			0
@entity19 's conversion made it 20 - 3 , and @entity4 could have no complaints , appearing clueless when faced by a heady combination of @entity0 ' power game and silky skills with ball in hand			1
@entity19 could not miss off the tee either , completing his penalty hat - trick with the final kick of a one - sided opening 40 minutes as @entity4 found themselves with a mountain to climb at 20 points adrift			0
they managed to keep @entity0 quiet for much of the third quarter , but a fourth @entity19 penalty took the home side further ahead before @entity4 again were forced into reverse gear , defending frantically inside their 22			2
@entity168 of @entity4 runs forward with the ball as he looks for a way to get his team back in the game @entity4 were a more cohesive unit in the second period , but @entity0 had long since inflicted telling damage as visiting prop @entity176 was sin - binned by referee @entity177 for tackling a player off the ball			0
@entity0 flanker @entity179 and @entity4 skipper @entity180 then got involved in a touchline skirmish , and although @entity177 took no action , it fired the visitors into action and @entity51 touched down near the posts 10 minutes from time , with @entity54 converting			0
inevitably , though , @entity0 had the final word in a game that they dominated when the outstanding @entity15 led @entity4 's defence a merry dance by touching down and completing a richly impressive afternoon 's work			0
@entity192 @entity191 had a relatively stress - free afternoon as @entity0 moved to the top of @entity194			2

the win sees @entity0 move to the top of @entity194
@entity19 impressed ahead of the @entity24 squad next week
@entity4 are facing the prospect of pool - stage elimination
