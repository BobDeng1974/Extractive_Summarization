@entity19 : @entity3 speaking during a presentation ceremony in @entity21 last year			0
today a communications watchdog ruled the intelligence services were not involved in ' mass intrusion ' however the interception of @entity26 did raise fears that the police were engaged in the ‘ institutional overuse ’ of surveillance powers			1

sir @entity13 said he was concerned that police and the @entity38 were failing to consider privacy issues			1
by contrast , the former high court judge gave the three intelligence and security agencies a clean bill of health following a wide - ranging review of their activities			2
he said they did not ‘ misuse ’ the powers given to them by @entity52 to engage in ‘ random mass intrusion in to the private lives of law abiding citizens ’			2
such acts are not permitted by law and would be ‘ comprehensively unlawful ’ , he added			0
speech : yesterday , the rogue agent joined a discussion via video - link , about the @entity7 government 's use of mass surveillance during a parliamentary session in @entity67 the public should be reassured that unless they ‘ associate with potential terrorists or serious criminals ... none of the interception agencies has the slightest interest in examining their emails , their phone or postal communications or their use of the internet ’ , he said			1
sir @entity13 also rejected allegations that spying agencies were ‘ getting around the law ’ by receiving intercepted communications about @entity87 citizens indirectly from @entity7 spy agencies			1
