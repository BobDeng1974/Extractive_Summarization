the @entity1 - based companies that provide the @entity2 with @entity4 tanks , once again proved to be one of the big winners when congress passed a $ 1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill this week			1

' @entity25 chairs the @entity39 and @entity38 of the @entity40 and will retain that position in the next @entity42 , reports @entity43			0

built to dominate the enemy in combat , the hulking @entity4 tank weigh 70 - ton and the army had suggested that production lines could be kept open through foreign sales			1
