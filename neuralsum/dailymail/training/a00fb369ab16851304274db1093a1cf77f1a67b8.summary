@entity1 bosses have been accused of ‘ rationing ’ the amount of sex men with impotence problems can have			1
they have told doctors to prescribe no more than one pill of ‘ generic ’ @entity7 a week to each patient they see			2
the managers sent the note even though unbranded versions of @entity7 , called sildenafil , are now cheap			2
a four - pill pack costs the @entity1 just £ 1.45 , or 36p a tablet			1
as a result , the @entity26 recently scrapped rules on prescribing sildenafil , so the vast majority of men with erectile dysfunction problems can get it on the @entity1			1
but that decision – revealed in @entity34 last week – appears to have worried some local health managers fighting to balance their books			1
cheap : tablets of sildenafil , an unbranded version of @entity7 used by the @entity1 , cost just 36p each in a missive to gps in the @entity47 , managers at @entity42 and @entity43 ( @entity44 ) demanded gps limit their prescribing of sildenafil			1
they wrote : ‘ in light of the pressure on @entity1 budgets , patients who are eligible for @entity1 treatment should be prescribed the lowest effective dose , with a maximum frequency of one tablet per week ( ie four per month )			2

however , @entity75 can make life difficult for doctors they believe are costing them too much			0
@entity44 has also warned doctors to look out for patients who might sell the pills for a profit			0
‘ consider these drugs have a street value and quantities should be agreed after a discussion with the patient assessing realistic needs , ’ they said			0
a spokesman for @entity44 stressed it was not capping how much sildenafil doctors could prescribe , saying it was up to @entity48			0
@entity42 and @entity93 did not comment .			0

drop in cost of ' generic ' viagra recently led to the @entity26 making tablets available to patients on the @entity1
unbranded version that they use - ' sildenafil ' - costs just 36p per pill
despite this - some health managers are still worried about what they *'re* *spending* on the drug and want to limit the amounts prescribed
one gp , dr @entity58 , has *criticised* the idea of ' rationing sex '
