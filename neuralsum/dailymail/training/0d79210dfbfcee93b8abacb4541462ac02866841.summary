by @entity0 published : 09:23 est , 27 september 2012 updated : 05:31 est , 28 september 2012 former @entity2 football captain @entity1 has been banned for four matches after the @entity4 has found him guilty of racial abuse			1
the 31 - year - old @entity7 captain had denied an @entity4 charge that he racially abused @entity9 in a @entity11 match last october			0
he was acquitted in a criminal case in july			2
but following an @entity4 independent regulatory commission hearing , he has now been banned for four matches and given a £ 220,000 fine for using insulting words which included a reference to @entity9 's colour or race			1
the verdict comes just days after @entity1 sensationally retired from international football and his position as @entity2 captain			1
the @entity4 today found @entity1 had used insulting words which included a reference to @entity9 's colour or race @entity1 retired just hours before the @entity4 hearing was expected to begin			1
he claimed the @entity4 made his position ‘ untenable ’ over the well - known incident and that the decision ' breaks my heart '			0
after four days hearing evidence , from @entity1 , @entity9 and other witnesses , the independent panel handed down their verdict this afternoon			1
the fine he has been forced to pay is the equivalent of the footballer working fewer than 10 days based on his current £ 150,000 - a - week deal at @entity7			0
a statement from the @entity4 said : ' an @entity52 has today found a charge of misconduct against @entity1 proven and has issued a suspension for a period of four matches and a fine of £ 220,000 , pending appeal			1
' the @entity4 charged mr @entity1 on friday 27th july , 2012 , with using abusive and / or insulting words and / or behaviour towards @entity62 ' @entity9 and which included a reference to colour and / or race contrary to @entity65 [ 2 ] in relation to the @entity62 versus @entity7 fixture at @entity68 on october 23rd , 2011			1
' the charge was the result of the @entity4 's long - standing investigation into this matter , which was placed on hold at the request of the @entity75 and mr @entity1 's representatives pending the outcome of the criminal trial			2
' the decision of the @entity52 is as follows : mr @entity1 be suspended from all domestic club football until such time as @entity7 's @entity82 have completed four competitive matches , and fined the sum of £ 220,000			2
' the penalty is suspended until after the outcome of any appeal , or the time for appealing expires , or should mr @entity1 decide not to appeal			0
the reason for this is to ensure that the penalty does not take effect before any appeal so that mr @entity1 has an effective right of appeal			0
' earlier @entity1 left @entity24 after two - and - a - half hours in his silver @entity26 , followed shortly after by his legal team clutching boxes of paperwork and a suitcase , who piled into a waiting taxi without making a comment on the verdict			0
barring any appeal , the verdict brings the 11 month controversy to an end after @entity1 allegedly called the @entity62 player , who is @entity1 's former @entity2 colleague @entity109 's younger brother , a " f * * * * * * black c * * * " during a @entity11 clash at @entity68			2

the fine @entity1 has been ordered to pay is the equivalent of him working less than 10 days based on his current £ 150,000 - a - week deal at @entity7 the panel found a charge of misconduct against @entity1 proven			2
the verdict brings the 11 month controversy to an end banned : a four - man panel has heard evidence from both @entity1 and @entity9 , as well as supportive testimony from @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and his assistant when he was @entity2 manager , @entity127 @entity1 was cleared of a a criminal charge of racially aggravated public order offence at @entity130 in july , but the @entity4 brought disciplinary charges under its own rules - he was charged with using ' abusive and / or insulting words and / or behaviour , which included a reference to ethnic origin and / or - colour and / or race '			1
he will have 14 days to appeal against the verdict - meaning that the affair could drag on deep into next month - and the @entity4 could also appeal if it was unhappy with the verdict			0
if @entity1 does not appeal @entity7 's next four matches from which he will banned are are @entity142 away on saturday , @entity143 at home , @entity145 away and @entity146 at home , but he could still play in the @entity148 for his club			0

@entity1 's barrister , @entity157 - @entity156 , initially argued that the @entity4 case should be thrown out because the player had been cleared of criminal charges this year			0
