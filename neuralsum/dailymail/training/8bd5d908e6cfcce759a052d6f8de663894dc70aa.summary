along with many other media companies , @entity5 is anxiously awaiting the government ’s long - delayed @entity97 for its proposed @entity99 which will have major implications for digital media in the @entity90			1
@entity5 has been repeatedly criticised for paying tax on less than a quarter of its @entity90 income			1
in 2010 it generated £ 2.1bn here but locates its international operations in @entity93 ( above ) , where it can take advantage of the 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate last night @entity106 , @entity70 ’s media spokesman , said : ‘ of course it is important for ministers to listen to business , but a meeting with @entity5 every month does look like the sort of privileged access that small businesses can only dream of			1
‘ ministers must disclose what they discussed			0
did they challenge @entity5 over their repellent tax avoidance , which was uncovered by the @entity117 ? ’ the record of meetings , obtained from research into departmental websites , shows other @entity3 ministers to have met @entity5 are further education minister @entity123 , universities minister @entity125 , policy minister @entity124 and business minister @entity126			1
two @entity128 dems – business secretary @entity129 and @entity130 , then an employment minister – have met the firm			0

last night a spokesman for @entity5 said : ‘ it ’s absolutely right that governments speak with companies about issues that affect their citizens			2
links with media giants are a highly sensitive topic for the @entity31			0
@entity153 revelations have included the toe - curling text messages between the pm and @entity28 ' former chief executive , @entity57 ( above ) ‘ the @entity157 makes the list of those meetings publicly available – including the @entity117 ’s 34 meetings over the same period			0
’ last night a @entity3 source said the government was working with internet firms to install higher - speed broadband , to crack down on online porn , and to draw up a major @entity97 on communications , and that it was wrong to say @entity5 had any special access because of mr @entity17 ’s relationship with @entity169			1
a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ all these meetings have been properly declared and it is normal for relevant ministers to meet with a company of this size			1
’ @entity169 and @entity176 have been linked to mr @entity17 since 1992 first it was @entity53 , now @entity31 ' get too close to @entity5 ' the number of meetings between @entity3 ministers and @entity5 executives raises questions because of @entity17 ’s close relationship with his oldest political friend @entity169 and his wife @entity176			1
mr @entity169 was until recently the prime minister ’s most trusted adviser in @entity187 , and miss @entity176 is global head of communications at @entity190 in @entity191			0
the three met in 1992 when they worked together on @entity194 ’s successful election campaign			0
mr @entity17 then became a @entity196 special adviser , alongside @entity197 , while mr @entity169 set up his own consultancy firm			2
the three became lynchpins of the ‘ @entity201 ’			0
mr @entity169 even became godfather to @entity17 and @entity204 ’s late son @entity203 , and the pm is godfather to the @entity205 ’ second son			2
it was @entity169 who persuaded mr @entity17 to run for the @entity3 leadership in 2005 after @entity208 – for whom @entity176 was by this time working as chief of staff – stepped down			1
mr @entity208 ’s resignation prompted miss @entity176 to join the private sector , and she got a communications job at @entity5			2
mr @entity17 took on mr @entity169 , who had been working for advertising firm @entity213 , as chief strategic policy adviser , where he became known for his ‘ blue sky thinking ’ and came up with the idea of the @entity217			2
but questions soon grew over whether mr @entity169 ’s wife ’s position at @entity5 was giving the internet giant too much influence on @entity3 policy			1
mr @entity17 addressed the firm ’s annual conference twice , in 2006 and 2007			2
around this time he began to talk about encouraging patients to store their medical records with companies such as @entity5			2
the then @entity230 health spokesman @entity229 , now a minister in the @entity231 , said : ‘ it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth that there are repeated references to @entity5 , given the closeness of @entity237 to that organisation , and it leaves concerns about commercial advantage			2
’ mr @entity169 moved with @entity237 to @entity187 on the formation of the @entity231			0
many of his policies were described as ‘ bonkers ’ by colleagues , and angered senior @entity128 dems as well as civil servants			0
he wanted to slash protections for workers to help business , advocated ignoring @entity252 laws and most recently called for the welfare budget to be slashed by a further £ 25billion			0
the arch - @entity254 also wanted to sack two in three civil servants , and urged ministers to fly with ‘ upstart ’ @entity257 rather than ‘ fat cat ’ @entity258			0
the shaven - headed son of @entity262 immigrants stood out in @entity187 as a result of his propensity to walk around shoeless and in a t - shirt , a get - up which caused @entity267 to call him a ‘ beach bum ’			0
mr @entity17 and mr @entity169 spoke every sunday and one insider said they were so close that he was the only person who could get the pm to change a policy within minutes			2
while mr @entity169 is an outsider in high society , miss @entity176 had a privileged upbringing more akin to mr @entity17 ’s			2
however , the relationship was not helped in the early 2000s by rumours of an affair with @entity279 , @entity204 ’s stepfather , before she got together with mr @entity169			0
in march it was announced that mr @entity169 was to take up an academic post at @entity282 in @entity191 to be near his wife			0
he plans to return next year			0
@entity176 is not the only senior @entity3 official to have links to @entity5			1
@entity83 , daughter of mr @entity17 ’s @entity287 neighbour @entity286 , worked with @entity197 in @entity5 ’s public policy division and is still an executive there			1
she was previously an adviser to culture secretary @entity25			0
