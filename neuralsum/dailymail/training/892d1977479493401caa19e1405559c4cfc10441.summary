ex-constable @entity7 , 67 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , was stunned when he saw the @entity11 police car while flicking through an edition of @entity13 on holiday last year			1
the limited edition high - performance vehicle was once the enemy of many a villain on the @entity20 police force patch four decades ago			2
reunited : former constable @entity7 , 67 , with the @entity22 he last drove in the 1970s @entity7 instantly recognised the picture of himself and colleague pc @entity24 standing next their old friend ' tango 8 in 1972			1
the pair used to patrol the county together in much the same way as officers in the popular 1960s tv show @entity33			0
now , 40 years after they were snapped , @entity7 has been reunited with the cult car			1
the former bobby last drove his beloved souped - up squad car in 1974 before it was sold at auction for £ 300			2
the 1970 @entity40 , which packed a 1600cc , 109bhp @entity11 engine , finally emerged from under a dust cover in 2006			1
car enthusiast @entity45 bought the exclusive motor , which could hit 108mph , for just £ 500 intending to use only its engine and sell the rest for scrap			1
nostalgia : @entity7 , left , snapped with the @entity40 alongside his colleague @entity24 back in 1972 but @entity53 changed his mind after researching the car 's history and decided to restore the rare vehicle - thought to be one of just two ever made for the police			1
@entity7 said this particular @entity60 was built specially for the police and could out - perform other traffic motors at the time by more than 20mph			2
' @entity11 made us the four - door version of the car because we could n't ask criminals to climb over the front seats , ' he said			1
' it had a sports engine in a normal car and could do 0 - 60mph in nine seconds			0
i suppose for police cars these days it 's more like five			0
' @entity7 joined the force in 1962 and transferred to the traffic unit in 1970 , where he stayed until he left in 1994			2
the picture was taken by a @entity80 officer at the scene of a fatal accident on the @entity83 between @entity84 and @entity85 , he said			0
' i had n't seen the image before i saw it in the magazine because i forgot to pick it up , ' he said			0
@entity33 : @entity7 patrolled the streets in his @entity40 in much the same way as the cult tv show			0
@entity92 , left , plays pc @entity93 and @entity95 , right , plays pc @entity96 in an episode from 1965 @entity100 @entity22 version of @entity11 's @entity40 was @entity102 's most popular new car of @entity104 's patrol car was a version of the most sough - after model - the @entity98 produced : 1,159,389 units0 - 60mph : @entity107 : @entity108 : @entity109 : 875kgs the glamorous and highly sought - after @entity11 has been on show at @entity111 in @entity8			1
' seeing the car again was brilliant , ' said @entity7			2
' @entity53 has done a really good job at getting it back into its former state			0
i got to drive it again			0
it did n't feel exactly the same as it did all those years ago but i 'm so glad that it was saved from the scrapyard			0
' it brought back many flashbacks of running blood samples and transplant organs to @entity125			0
' we could get there about five minutes quicker than any other squad car			0
but seeing the old car next to the current police fleet of @entity132 7 series shows just how much technology and motoring has changed over the years			0
' the @entity60 is now worth more than £ 16,000 and @entity53 hopes to restage the 40 - year - old photo of @entity7 and @entity136 with their old motor at the same spot			1
the ex-police car 's story will be completed when it meets its sister - which is close to being fully restored by a @entity11 mechanic in @entity144 .			1

retired constable @entity7 , 67 , saw a picture of himself with his former patrol car from 1972 in an edition of @entity13 magazine
car enthusiast @entity151 restored the @entity11 after *buying* it for just £ 500 in 2006
it was one of only two ever made by @entity11 for the police and is now worth more than £ 16,000
