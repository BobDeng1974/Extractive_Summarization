by @entity0 , @entity1 editor food prices are predicted to rise faster than incomes every year until 2018 , with meat and fresh fruit and vegetables becoming only an occasional treat for some			1
the cost of putting food on the table is forecast to rise by 3.8 per cent next year and still further in 2015 , according to industry experts			1
they also say the cost of eating out in restaurants and pubs has increased by seven per cent in the past six months			1
fresh fruit and vegetables are due to become a rare treat for some as food prices are set to rise a report from @entity22 , which supplies the restaurant trade , said lower harvests as a result of volatile weather , and high demand for meat from the growing middle classes in countries such as @entity31 and @entity32 have resulted in a ‘ perfect storm ’ to push up costs			1
fruit prices rose by 10.2 per cent in the past year , vegetables by 5.4 per cent , meat by 5.2 per cent and fish by 4.9 per cent			1
evidence from government studies shows that many @entity41 households , particularly those on low incomes , have consumed less fruit , vegetables and meat since the cost - of - living squeeze began five years ago			1
they have switched to less healthy , processed food , while fresh meat and produce are increasingly seen as a treat			1
@entity52 said the horsemeat scandal earlier this year , coupled with high costs of production and rising demand is keeping the price of beef high			2
mature cheddar cheese is up by 13 per cent from last year because of limited milk supply			1
by contrast , chicken should get cheaper , according to @entity63 , after a 20 per cent fall predicted in the cost of corn used for feed			1
there is also hope that a sharp increase in the cost of salmon in recent years is unlikely to continue , because shoppers simply can not afford to pay any more			2
@entity52 said its figures are in tune with those from analysts @entity77 , which has forecast that average household food bills will rise by £ 850 per year by 2018 – adding up to £ 19.6billion to the @entity41 ’s annual grocery bill			1
supermarkets battle it out to prove they give the best value			0
but one shop opening today can really claim to be @entity41 ’s cheapest store			1
the ‘ social supermarket ’ , in @entity89 , @entity90 , is packed with branded groceries , reduced by up to two thirds			0
up to 500 people can become members of the discount store run by @entity94 , as long as they claim one of a specified list of benefits including @entity98			0
@entity99 will arrive daily from manufacturers and suppliers with the consent of shops such as @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			0
@entity109 , of @entity94 ’s parent firm , said 500 people will be given membership for six months to test the idea , with the hope of launching 20 nationwide next year , including six in @entity114			2
‘ it is not just about the long - term unemployed but really hard - working families who are struggling , ’ she said			0
the supermarket will use residual food not needed by larger retailers for reasons such as damaged packaging or the wrong labelling			0
‘ while we have people in the @entity41 going hungry it is wrong such foods should be thrown away , ’ miss @entity109 added			1
average pay rises are running at just two per cent a year in the private sector and one per cent in the public sector , according to figures collated by @entity131			2
@entity132 , chief executive of @entity63 , said : ‘ unpredictable weather patterns caused by climate change , an ever - increasing global population , rising production costs , commodity futures trading and water scarcity is putting a lot of pressure on food prices around the world			2
and this is n’t going to stop any time soon			0
this will not only have a significant impact on the costs of eating out and the things we eat , but also the average grocery bill			0
‘ we urge families to learn from the restaurant trade and take simple steps in planning and shopping to help control spiralling costs			0
’ he recommended families and pensioners consider switching to frozen vegetables rather than buying fresh , only to throw a lot of it away			0
he also suggested a return to simple ‘ meat and two veg ’ meals , rather than elaborate dishes with lots of ingredients			0
mr @entity132 added : ‘ you can get more value out of meat by using cheaper cuts such as chicken thighs instead of breasts or preparing dishes with more mixed ingredients , such as meat stews with pulses , root vegetables and dumplings			2
‘ people should reconsider the weekly shop and switch to frozen			0
recent research has found that up to six meals a week are wasted by the average @entity41 family			2
‘ to reduce this , families should consider whether it would be more economical to pick up fresh produce two or three times a week or consider switching some ingredients from fresh to frozen			0
