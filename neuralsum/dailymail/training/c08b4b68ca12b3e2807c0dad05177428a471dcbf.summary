@entity0 is a ' fraud ' who does not deserve a shot at the @entity5 world title , according to the current champion @entity6			1
@entity7 makes his return to the ring on saturday when he faces @entity10 at @entity11 in his first fight since being knocked out by @entity13 in their record - breaking clash on may 31st			1
on the line is the @entity19 super-middleweight title as well as the nominal @entity5 silver strap – but most importantly , the winner will become the mandatory challenger to @entity23			1
@entity6 says @entity0 is a ' fraud ' who does not deserve a shot at the @entity5 world title but the 29 - year - old , who won the belt by beating @entity29 in @entity30 last month , says @entity0 is not a worthy challenger even if he takes care of little - known @entity33 on saturday			1
talking exclusively to @entity34 , @entity6 said : ' who is this @entity37 guy ? seriously i 've never heard of him			2
how can @entity0 fight him and then be my mandatory ? he 's a fraud			1
' he wants a fight with me ? he 's just lost twice to @entity13			2
tell him he needs to fight someone in the top 10			0
he 's fighting a bum			0
@entity0 fights @entity10 this weekend with the winner due to fight @entity5 champion @entity6 ' i won this belt the hard way and now he thinks he 's going to get a shot without fighting anyone			1
it 's not going to happen			0
' @entity0 , meanwhile , has been sent a letter from the @entity5 stating that the winner of saturday 's bout at @entity11 , just across the road from the @entity56 where he was brutally stopped by @entity13 , will be guaranteed a shot at @entity6			1
that means ' @entity60 ' will have to either face ' @entity62 ' or vacate the title			2
@entity0 and his promoters , @entity65 , will do all they can to get any world title challenge on home soil , but @entity6 insists he will not be crossing the @entity68 to face @entity7			1
@entity6 says @entity0 ' defeats to @entity13 , who also beat @entity6 's brother , means he does n't deserve a title shot @entity6 's older brother , @entity72 , was beaten by @entity13 on a split decision in @entity74 back in 2009 – incidentally for the same @entity5 belt currently held by his sibling			1
and it 's a decision which still rankles with the younger @entity6			0
he added : ' everyone saw what happened to my brother , he got a bad deal in the @entity83			0
it 's in the past now but that does n't mean i 'll let the same thing happen to me			0
' there 's no way i 'll be going to the @entity83			0
if they make @entity91 the @entity93 contender then he 's going to have to come here and try and beat me			0
and he wo n't do it			0
' i wo n't be giving him a shot in his own country			0
everyone knows what happens over there - i wo n't be going over there to fight			0
' champion @entity6 said that if he does have to fight @entity91 the @entity102 is going to have to cross the @entity68 and in a further taunt to @entity0 , @entity6 revealed he would rather try to avenge his brother 's loss and set up a super-middleweight unification fight with @entity107 and @entity108 king @entity13 , who is still yet to decide his next move following his victory at @entity11			1
@entity6 said : ' the @entity13 fight would be an option			1
i want to fight the best - and @entity0 is not the best			2
' @entity13 though , he 's one of the top guys , a good fighter who has beaten @entity0 twice in a row , he 's more deserving but we do n't know what he 's doing yet			1
' we got to wait and see			0
@entity6 wants another shot at him but if the money was right then i would love that fight			2
' @entity6 's last @entity122 fight was against @entity29 last month			2

@entity0 is a ' fraud ' who does n't deserve @entity5 world title shot
that is the *opinion* of current champion @entity6
@entity91 facing @entity10 at @entity11 on saturday
it will be @entity0 ' first fight since defeat to @entity13
@entity91 vs @entity137 winner will face @entity6
