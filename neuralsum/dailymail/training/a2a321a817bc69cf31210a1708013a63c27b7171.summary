by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 failed to provide basic life - saving treatment to the baby when he arrived at the scene a paramedic who failed to give adequate emergency care to a new - born baby boy that was blue and ‘ looked dead ’ was suspended for a year today			1
@entity2 raced to an address in @entity11 , @entity12 , after receiving an emergency call about a woman in labour			1
but when he arrived he made no attempt to give the baby oxygen despite the fact that he was struggling to breathe , the @entity16 heard			1
fellow paramedic @entity21 attended the scene shortly after @entity2 when the emergency call was made at 7.13am			2
she said : ‘ i immediately thought that baby was not breathing adequately enough - it looked a horrible colour and actually , in all honesty , it looked dead			2
‘ the baby was laid on towels with its arms up in the air above its head , not wrapped just with an open towel underneath it			2
’ mrs @entity21 explained the baby was in ‘ serious respiratory distress , almost on the stage of death ’ when she arrived			2
she said @entity2 failed to provide basic life - saving ventilation oxygenation and that the standard of care given was inadequate			1
@entity2 had worked for the @entity38 for 28 years			2
he blew on the baby ’s face and rubbed him with towels but did not use a resuscitation kit because he said he did not have the right equipment			1
the baby improved on the journey to the hospital and recovered at @entity47 on arrival			0
@entity2 was found to have provided inadequate care to the new - born baby , in that he did oxygenate or deliver ventiliations			1
the panel also found that @entity2 did not seek urgent assistance or make his bosses aware of the baby ’s condition			1
@entity16 panel chairman @entity58 said : ‘ the panel is satisfied that the registrant expressed real and genuine remorse as he wanted to see the family after the event to see if the baby was alright			0
the baby boy improved during his ambulance journey and recovered at @entity66 in @entity11 ‘ but the panel is of the view that the registrant has a limited insight into his failings , demonstrated by his admissions			0
‘ however , he does not fully accept that he has failed to act promptly in a time critical situation			0
‘ he has failed to demonstrate that he has reflected on the situation , has learned how things went wrong and how he would address such a situation differently in the future			0
‘ the trust had identified a college based assessment day in respect of paediatric care , the need for a reflective log and the need to be assessed by a tutor in terms of leadership before the registrant could return to being part of a crew			0
‘ the registrant failed to take up any of these suggestions and has instead decided that he no longer wishes to practise			0
‘ although he is no longer operating as a paramedic , he remains employed on an ad hoc basis as an emergency care assistant			0
‘ he has taken early retirement and said that he wished to avoid stress , wanted to give new paramedics an opportunity and wished to devote his time to family			0
