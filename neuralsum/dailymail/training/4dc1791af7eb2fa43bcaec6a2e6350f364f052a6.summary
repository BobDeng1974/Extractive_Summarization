by @entity0 published : 20:30 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 20:31 est , 27 august 2013 atheists are threatening to sue over a 9/11 memorial			1
the @entity1 , based in @entity3 , told the mayor of @entity5 this week that they will take the town to court if the side of a beam recovered from the @entity10 site was displayed on public property or publicly funded			1
the letter says the beam must be placed in a ‘ designated free speech zone that enables members of all other religious groups or otherwise to place their own memorials with their own unique symbols , ’ according to the @entity19			2
controversial : atheists are planning to sue the town of @entity5 , @entity3 over a memorial incorporating a beam with this cross carved into it ‘ while the intention to commemorate those who died at the @entity10 is admirable and appropriate for a community , the use of such a singular religious image will be grossly offensive and alienating to many people , ’ attorney @entity25 wrote in the letter , which asked for a response by sept. 3			1
@entity5 deputy fire chief @entity34 acquired the beam for the town on his own , according to the @entity19			2
he wants to place it on state - owned land near the @entity38 , the @entity19 reported			2
@entity5 has also made land for a memorial available near the old borough hall , the paper noted			0
designed by an architecture firm donating its time , the memorial is estimated to cost about $ 100,000 , reported the @entity19			0
@entity34 told the paper the money could be obtained from the town or through donations			0
putting the memorial on public land and / or funding it with taxpayer money is where @entity53 object			0
they are threatening to file an injunction if either , or both , comes to pass			0
a tribute : firefighters carved the crosses into beams and placed where fallen firefighters were found by rescue and recovery workers ' we have our attorney looking into if we would be open to litigation for this and what the risk is , ' @entity5 mayor @entity67 told @entity72			1
the inclusion of a religious symbol also worried some town council members , with one fearing it would give the impression government favors one religion over others and another saying concerned residents planned to file a lawsuit , they told the @entity19			0
@entity34 defended the cross , saying it is more a part of history than it is a religious symbol , explaining to @entity72 that rescue and recovery workers at @entity87 carved the crosses into the beams where they found fallen firefighters			1
heroes : over 300 firefighters sacrificed their lives to save others at @entity87 on 9/11 @entity25 disagrees			1
‘ while the image of the cross on the girder is the space remaining after a cross was carved from the girder , it nonetheless presents the indisputable image of a cross on a memorial for those who died in the attacks of 9/11 — a religious image in remembrance of the dead , ’ he wrote , according to the @entity19			1
‘ it goes without saying that the image of the cross is a common religious feature on the graves of the deceased who adhered in life to a @entity115 faith			2
’ the town could avoid all this by simply turning the beam on its side so the cross is not visible			1
@entity34 was initially planning to have the memorial in place by this september , that is now highly unlikely given the possibility of this issue being settled in a courtroom			0
calls placed by @entity128 to @entity53 , @entity5 officials and @entity25 seeking further comment were not answered .			0

the use of a beam recovered from @entity87 with a cross carved into it is *catalyzing* the atheists
the crosses were *welded* into beams and placed where fallen firefighters were found by rescue and recovery workers
