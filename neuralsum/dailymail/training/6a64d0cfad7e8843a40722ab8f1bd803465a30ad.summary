by @entity0 published : 11:31 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 19:42 est , 5 february 2013 war of words : @entity3 compared @entity4 to illegal @entity6 settlers in the @entity7 a senior @entity9 politician has sparked outrage by claiming his country will run the @entity4 within 20 years			1
@entity3 , the country ’s foreign minister , also compared the islanders to illegal @entity6 settlers in the @entity7			1
mr @entity3 escalated the war of words over sovereignty during his first visit to @entity17			1
although he ruled out another military invasion of the islands , he went on to denounce the @entity20 as ‘ fanatics ’ who were only interested in the windswept @entity24 outcrop because of its potentially lucrative offshore oil reserves			2
in an interview , mr @entity3 made his controversial predication of future @entity9 sovereignty over the @entity4 , saying : ‘ i do n’t think it will take another 20 years			1
’ he added : ‘ i think that the world is going through a process of understanding more and more that this is a colonial issue			0
’ mr @entity3 also snubbed a member of the @entity4 government who tried to present him with a letter dismissing @entity9 ’s claim over the islands , and then refused to attend a meeting with foreign secretary @entity40 because members of the island parliament would be there			1
mr @entity3 made his unprecedented visit to the @entity20 to discuss issues relating to the @entity4 a month before around 1,500 islanders hold their first vote on whether they want to remain @entity20			1
the historic referendum , set for march 10 - 11 and which will be overseen by international observers , is expected to send a clear message to @entity9 to keep its hands off			2
@entity3 , left , has refused to meet @entity40 , right , because the @entity20 politician insisted on a representative of the @entity4 being present but during heated exchanges in @entity56 , mr @entity3 claimed the vote over the future of the islands – known in @entity9 as @entity4 – was meaningless			1
he said : ‘ the self - determination referendum does n’t apply to the @entity4			2
it is a colonised territory			0
’ he compared the situation to @entity6 ’s breach of @entity65 resolutions by building homes on @entity68 territory in the @entity7 and @entity69			0
mr @entity3 said : ‘ a few weeks ago , @entity20 complained to @entity6 because of building in the settlements and said that was against the peace process			1
' it is strange that you behave one way in the @entity4 but complain about the settlements			2
‘ the people living in the @entity4 are subjects , they are not native			0
' it is a population that came after the invasion of the territory			0
it is like asking settlers in the @entity7 if they want to be @entity6 or @entity68			0
it does not make sense			0
’ mr @entity3 said they has been trying to negotiate a peaceful solution to the dispute for the past 180 years the @entity9 politician said a referendum on whether the islanders want to remain @entity20 is meaningless diplomatic friction between @entity20 and @entity9 has increased since 2010 when oil exploration was authorised in the waters around the islands , which have been under @entity20 control since 1833			1
mr @entity3 added yesterday : ‘ i think the fanatics are maybe in the @entity20			1
[ @entity20 ] is using the people living in the islands for political reasons and to have access to oil and natural resources which belong to the @entity9 people			2
’ @entity104 mp @entity103 said mr @entity3 ’s comments were ‘ offensive ’ and @entity106 , a @entity104 peer , blasted @entity108 for using ‘ megaphone diplomacy ’			0
@entity110 , a member of the @entity4 parliament , had tried to present a letter to mr @entity3 but was brushed aside			1
the letter stated : ‘ the referendum next month will make it very clear that we do not wish to be ruled by @entity9			0
no amount of harassment and intimidation by your government against our community will change this fact			0
’ last year the @entity9 government accused the @entity20 of ‘ militarising ’ the @entity24			0
@entity20 currently has four warships , four @entity127 fighter - bombers and around 1,200 troops on the islands .			0

foreign minister @entity3 said @entity20 only wants @entity4 oil
has refused to meet foreign secretary @entity40 during @entity17 visit
