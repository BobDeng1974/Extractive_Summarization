mr @entity6 , who is also from @entity11 , said : ' i was told that i could n’t work while i was wearing it as it did not match uniform standards			1
' it is ridiculous , it was @entity5 and it was a little thing that i wanted to do to celebrate it			1
' @entity5 is part of @entity4 culture , i did n’t want to offend anyone or cause malice and i do n’t believe i did			2
' i ’m disgusted as i ’m a patriotic guy and to me it is wrong that i was n’t allowed to celebrate @entity4 culture and was deterred from doing so , as i was n’t doing any harm			1
' i think it is a sad state of affairs if we are stopped from acknowledging our culture			0
' @entity9 ( @entity10 ) , where mr @entity6 had worked for eight months , said mr @entity6 was asked not to return because he had ' an issue with the dress code ' mr @entity6 had worked at @entity10 , which stocks @entity41 parts , for eight months through the agency @entity42 , he had handed in his notice one day earlier because he had a new job			1
