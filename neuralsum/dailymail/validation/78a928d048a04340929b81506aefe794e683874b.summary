@entity1 narcotics agents with @entity3 clearances had wild ' sex parties ' with prostitutes hired by @entity7 drug cartel members , according to a blockbuster report from the @entity10 's internal investigations arm			1
the @entity11 has yet to comment on the findings in the exposé from the @entity10 's @entity14			1
at least seven @entity11 agents admitted to investigators that they had sex with hookers while on overseas assignments			1
but instead of firing or prosecuting them , the agency treated their cases as a ' local management issue ' and suspended them for between 2 and 14 days			1
the @entity24 cautioned in the report , released thursday morning , that @entity1 law enforcement personnel who engage in illicit sex – even in places where it 's legal or unofficially tolerated – can be vulnerable to ' coercion , extortion , and blackmail			1
' the @entity34 chairman of the congressional panel that specializes in inter-governmental investigations lobbed rhetorical bombs at the @entity10 after the report surfaced online , calling its allegations ' truly stunning			2
' ' let there be no mistake , this is a national security threat , ' said @entity44 rep. @entity43			0
@entity45 to read the report trouble in @entity7 : @entity11 officers had hooker parties allegedly paid for with drug cartel money @entity51 - @entity50 : @entity11 agents had @entity3 clearances when they went on sex romps with hookers ' we need to hold them accountable and , given the clear evidence in the @entity14 report , they should be fired immediately , ' he said of the offending agents			1
' we need to weed out those who risk our national security , embarrass the county , and skirt the law			2
' @entity43 promised that his panel , the @entity66 , ' will pursue this vigorously ' after next week 's congressional recess			0
in all , the @entity24 report flagged 621 cases where agents in the @entity73 , @entity11 , @entity74 and @entity75 were accused of a wide variety of sex - related offenses			1
they ranged from sexting and sexual liaisons between supervisors and subordinates to the consumption of child pornography and sexual abuse of minors and prison imnates			0
in the prostitudion cases , the @entity24 wrote , ' @entity11 supervisors treated the alleged misconduct as a local management issue ' even though the ' these special agents held @entity3 clearances			1
' one case involved agents ' patronizing prostitutes and frequenting a brothel while in an overseas posting			2
... it was also alleged that one of the subjects in the supervisors ’ group assaulted a prostitute following a payment dispute			0
' ' the acting assistant regional director who supervised the two special agents in this case , ' investigators wrote , ' was also alleged to have solicited prostitutes ... in that case , the @entity110 allegedly engaged in sexual relations with prostitutes at a farewell party in the @entity110 ’s honor			1
' ' there were also allegations operational funds were used to pay for the party and the prostitutes who participated			2
' in all , six hookers attended that soiree			0
supervisors allegedly knew about it but never referred the case to the @entity10 for disciplinary action			1
a tipster ultimately blew the whistle on two of the agents , claiming in an anonymous letter to @entity11 higher - ups that they had frequented prostitutes on a regular basis while on oversead tour - of - duty assignments			2
in a separate case , the inspector general describes @entity11 agents who attended prostitute ' sex parties arranged by a @entity7 law enforcement officer and funded with money from drug cartels themselves			1
the parties , the @entity24 said , happened in the agents ' government - leased apartments over a period of several years			2
agents ' laptops , blackberry devices , and other government - issued equipment were typically lying around , creating ' potential security risks ' and potentially making agents vulnerable to ' extortion , blackmail , or coercion			2
' foreign officers later claimed they held on to the @entity1 agents ' guns while they were indulging in the hooker - fests			2
they also claimed they gave three @entity11 supervisory agents ' money , expensive gifts , and weapons from drug cartel members			1
' ultimately , 7 of the 10 agents the @entity24 interviewed admitted taking part in the ' sex parties			2
' they were suspended for between 2 and 10 days , but never prosecuted criminally			0
overall , the @entity11 limited its punishment to a maximum of 14 days , in part because @entity7 authorities generally turn a blind eye to the sex trade			1
' the @entity178 told us that prostitution is considered a part of the local culture and is tolerated in certain areas called " tolerance zones " , ' the @entity177 wrote			0
' according to the inspector , it is common for prostitutes to be present at business meetings involving cartel members and foreign officers			1
' @entity192 : ' let there be no mistake , this is a national security threat , ' said @entity44 rep. @entity43 the @entity10 's inspector general found a wide range of sex - related offenses in the case files of the @entity73 , @entity11 , @entity74 and @entity200 , including sex with prostitutes and sexual assault of minors the @entity200 also got a black eye in the inspector general report			1
in one 2010 case described in detail , two deputy marshalls traevled to @entity210 to pick up a criminal defendant who was being extradited to the @entity1			0
every time the @entity212 tried to contact one of the men , one of two women with foreign accents would answer his phone and say he could n't be disturbed			0
' a local investigator for the @entity212 spoke to one of the women in @entity210 ' and ' confirmed she was a prostitute , ' the @entity24 wrote			0
when he got home , the deputy was forbidden to travel overseas again			0
but he fuond a way to conduct at least one more extradition mission anyway and kept his security clearance			0
a nother deputy ' entered into a romantic relationship ' with the spouse of a fugitive criminal suspect			0
when his supervisors told him to break off the fling , it took him a year to do it			0
the @entity74 was relatively unscathed by the @entity24 investigation , with one glaring exception			0
an @entity74 director of industry operations , investigators wrote , ' solicited consensual sex with anonymous partners and modified a hotel room door to facilitate sexual play			0
' management at the hotel caught him disabling a fire detection system ; he insisted he had done it before with no problem			0
separately , an @entity73 assistant section chief who trained his fellow agents on child exploitation and human trafficking issues ' engaged in multiple consensual and commercial sexual encounters over a 7 - year period , ' according to the report			1
his partners included ' foreign nationals , including prostitutes , strippers , students in his classes , and members of foreign law enforcement			1
