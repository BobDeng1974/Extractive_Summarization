by @entity0 , @entity1 full - back @entity2 has urged @entity4 to tighten up at the back in order to continue their fine start to the @entity10 season			1
@entity12 boss @entity11 called for defensive improvements after overseeing a thrilling 6 - 3 victory at @entity15 on saturday			1
and , despite the glut of goals , @entity2 too would rather it had been straightforward			1
shape up ! full - back @entity2 has urged @entity4 to tighten up at the back in the @entity10 normal : @entity2 too would rather it had been straightforward like his @entity4 manager @entity11 ' we scored a lot of goals but we conceded a lot as well , and as defenders we are not happy , but at least at the end we got the three points , ' he said			1
' we are scoring more goals but we are conceding more goals from last year			2
' as a defender i do n't like to concede but i think we are playing better football collectively			2
i 'd prefer to win 1 - 0			1
' two of @entity11 's summer signings - @entity37 and @entity38 acquired at a combined cost of Â£ 62million - showed what a difference they can make at @entity42			1
@entity37 , a threat throughout , scored in the first and last minutes while @entity38 was influential in midfield			0
@entity4 have already scored 11 times in three matches , conceding four , and taken a maximum nine points compared to the same spell last season which brought four goals , one against and seven points			2
a lack of goals is what cost them in the title race last term , but that does not look like being a problem this time around			0
' last year sometimes we had to play very well to score goals and sometimes it looks easier now - obviously @entity37 is scoring for us , ' @entity2 added after seeing @entity37 take his tally to four			1
' i played against him last season and he is a good striker and we are happy to have him in our team			0
' he is a competitive guy who tries his best for the team			0
he is a worker and we want to provide better balls for the striker			0
we have to progress and keep improving			0
we have to play with more quality			0
' it is important for the squad to keep pushing because we want to play better and to win the games , which is most important			2
you get nothing for just playing well and having possession			0
' we have a very good squad and we have three wins from three games and it is important to start well			0
' @entity2 : ' as a defender i do n't like to concede but i think we are playing better football collectively ' hopeful : the @entity4 defender believes the @entity12 have a better chance this time around of winning the title			1

@entity4 kept 100 per cent up with 6 - 3 win at @entity42 over @entity15
@entity2 wants his @entity4 side to shape up in defence
the defender admits he would have preferred a normal 1 - 0 on saturday
