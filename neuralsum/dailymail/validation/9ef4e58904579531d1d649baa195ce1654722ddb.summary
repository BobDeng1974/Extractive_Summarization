the number of customers trapped in poor - paying @entity2 has doubled in the last two years savers are being hit with the worst interest rates in history with a third of @entity7 accounts now paying less than 1 per cent a year			1
the number of customers trapped in poor - paying @entity2 has doubled in the last two years as interest rates on them plummet to new lows			1
one in six accounts offer less than the @entity13 ’s base rate at just 0.5 per cent , while some savers are stuck on rates of 0.1 per cent			1
the proportion of these tax - free accounts returning below 1 per cent has doubled in the last two years , from one in six to one in three			1
it means that on the current worst @entity20 of 0.1 per cent , someone depositing £ 15,000 would make a paltry £ 15 a year in interest			0
in contrast , a saver on the most competitive rate of 1.5 per cent would make £ 225 – a difference of £ 210 a year			0
with four weeks left to use this year ’s £ 15,000 @entity7 allowance , many savers will question the value of such accounts			0
the @entity30 said there was not ‘ one single factor ’ driving down @entity7 rates but said the ‘ persistently low base rate ’ had contributed to lower returns			2
a spokesman added : ‘ i do n’t think there is a hard correlation between @entity7 rates and mortgage rates			0
the @entity30 said there was not ‘ one single factor ’ driving down @entity7 rates but said the ‘ persistently low base rate ’ had contributed to lower returns ‘ each provider has to strike a balance between savings rates and mortgage rates as they need both savers and borrowers			2
’ experts also blame the @entity49 for lending scheme , which allowed banks to borrow cheaply in return for handing out home and business loans after the economic crisis			0
the scheme meant that banks were no longer dependent on savers ’ money – reducing the need to offer competitive rates , it is claimed			0
@entity63 , of independent savings website @entity64 , said : ‘ after six years of the base rate at 0.5 per cent , this is toughest time on record for savers , and @entity7 savers have certainly not been immune to the pain			2
‘ isas were once seen as the go - to savings product due to their tax - free status			2
‘ but with rates at an all - time low , some savers – especially those looking to build up a short - term lump sum for perhaps a house deposit or a car – may need to be more creative			0
‘ high - interest savings accounts offer rates of up to 5 per cent before tax , so even a taxpayer could find that this route could earn them more interest			1
’ but @entity89 , of the website @entity90 , warned : ‘ despite the gloomy outlook on savings rates , consumers need to use their tax - free allowance or lose it			1
‘ while there might be an abundance of taxable savings accounts out there , it is always worthwhile to track down an @entity7 equivalent and use the yearly tax - free allowance			1
’ savers have lost out on £ 4.7billion in the last three years due to low interest rates .			0
