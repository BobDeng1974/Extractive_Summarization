by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:37 pm on 27th october 2011 desperate : colonel @entity3 's son @entity2 has demanded a plane to fly him from his desert hiding place to the @entity6 colonel @entity3 's fugitive son @entity2 wants an aircraft to take him out of @entity10 's southern desert so he can turn himself in to the @entity6 war crimes court			1
according to a source within @entity10 's @entity14 , @entity12 - educated @entity2 , 39 , is terrified of receiving the same treatment as his father who met a grisly death last week at the hands of vengeful @entity10 fighters			1
@entity2 went on the run at the time of his father 's capture and has indicated he is ready to surrender to justice like former intelligence chief @entity27 , @entity14 officials have said			2
both men are the subject of arrest warrants from the @entity31 , where officials have not been able to confirm any approach			2
they face charges of crimes against humanity for their response to february 's uprising			1
conflicting reports of @entity41 's whereabouts have circulated since he vanished from the @entity3 stronghold of @entity43 in the north of the country , with some accounts putting him , and @entity27 , in @entity47			1
confirmation from @entity3 's surviving entourage has not been available			1
one international lawyer who says he represents a member of the family questioned the reliability of @entity14 accounts but declined comment on the report of a proposed surrender			2
the @entity14 source said @entity41 had not left @entity10 and was being sheltered by a prominent figure among the nomadic @entity61 people of the desert , whom he had supported financially in the past			2
demise : according a source within the @entity14 ruling council @entity2 is terrified of meeting the same grisly fate as befell his father the rugged and empty area close to the borders of @entity47 and @entity74 has offered an escape route to others in his family			2
however , under @entity31 indictment , @entity41 would find it harder than his relatives to secure a safe haven abroad			0
he was reported by an aide to be fearing for his life when he fled @entity43 , and if he has seen the gruesome video footage of his father 's capture , he is likely to be under few illusions about how he might be treated if he remains in @entity10			2
' @entity2 is concerned about his safety , ' the @entity14 source said			0
' he believes handing himself over is the best option for him			0
' the source said @entity2 wanted the involvement of a third country - possibly @entity74 or @entity93 - in a deal to get him to the @entity6			2
' he wants to be sent an aircraft , ' the source said by telephone from @entity10			0
' stockpile : a huge hoard of munition crates were found at an unguarded storage facility in the @entity10 desert 62 miles south of @entity104 armed to the teeth : some of the heavy weapons discovered at the unguarded desert storage facility colonel @entity3 ’s driver has spoken of the dictator ’s final moments , claiming his boss showed no sign of fear before he was captured by rebels			1
' everything was exploding , ' said @entity116			0
' the revolutionaries were coming for us			0
he was n’t scared but he did n’t seem to know what to do			0
it was the only time i ever saw him like that			0
' moments later the revolutionaries overran their position and @entity116 was knocked to the ground with a rifle butt			0
his final glimpse of @entity3 was of him being dragged from a drainpipe and then surrounded by rebels who started to rain blows down on him			1
@entity116 and @entity3 ’s head of security , @entity136 , are believed to be the only survivors from the guards who accompanied the @entity10 leader during his final resistance in @entity104			1
they spent the five days before @entity3 ’s death moving from house to house			1
the former @entity10 leader , @entity116 said , appeared unable to understand how he had been reduced to such a position : ' he was strange			0
he was always standing still and looking to the west			0
i did n’t see fear in him			2
' following his capture , @entity116 was taken to a makeshift prison in @entity152			0
' if any of the other close staff are still alive , i do n’t know where they are or what happened to them , ' he said			0
' may be somewhere with the revolutionaries , or they may be dead			0
' still dressed in the blood - stained purple shirt he wore on the day @entity3 was killed , @entity116 continued : ' i was with him for 30 years and i swear by @entity159 that i never saw any bad behaviour in him			1
' he was always just my boss			0
i believed them when they said we are fighting bad people			0
' @entity2 's whereabouts and intentions had been tracked by monitoring satellite phone calls , the source said , together with information contained in intelligence cables			2
the @entity14 lacks the logistical capabilities to intercept fugitives deep in the desert			0
it has asked its @entity175 allies for further assistance as the @entity178 mission winds up following the death of the ousted leader			1
@entity175 officials have made clear , however , that they are keen to cut back their commitment now			1
@entity2 had been seen by analysts as his father 's heir - apparent and a potential reformer , but his bloodthirsty comments about the rebels this year forced a rethink			1
@entity190 security officials in @entity43 this week told how the son called his father frequently by satellite phone and became increasingly afraid of being hit by incoming fire			0
' he was afraid of mortars , ' said @entity196 , a lieutenant in @entity3 's army who was also part of @entity41 's personal security team			1
' casualties : a man stands among the graves of unknown victims of the conflict mr @entity27 , who is not related to @entity3 's former security chief , said that @entity2 's convoy was hit by a @entity175 air strike as he fled @entity43 but he escaped alive			1
@entity2 is the last remaining member of the @entity3 family currently at a large			1
it emerged to day that family members currently hiding in @entity74 plan to file a war - crimes complaint against @entity175 for the role they believe the international military alliance played in the former leader ’s death , @entity216 , a @entity217 lawyer who previously worked for @entity3 regime and now represents his family , said the complaint would be filed with the @entity31 in the @entity6 because the family believes a @entity175 strike on @entity224 ’s convoy led to his brutal death			1
@entity10 authorities have said he likely died in crossfire			0
others , including the international rights advocacy group @entity229 , believe he was executed			0
but @entity3 ’s family is convinced that he died as a result of @entity175 aircraft firing on his convoy as it fled @entity104			1
' the willful killing [ of someone protected by the @entity236 ] is defined as a war crime by @entity238 8 of the @entity31 's @entity239 , ' @entity216 said			2
' @entity3 's homicide shows that the goal of [ @entity175 ] member states was not to protect civilians but to overthrow the regime			1
' it was unclear when the complaint would be filed , but @entity216 said the lawsuit would target @entity175 executive bodies and leaders of the alliance ’s member states .			1
