ten years ago , i signed a letter backing @entity2 in the 2005 election			1
earlier this month i signed a letter backing the conservatives for this one			2
why the conversion ? i 'm not a tribally political animal			2
i am someone who runs and starts businesses , but most importantly wants to see our country succeed			2
five years ago the world was facing catastrophic economic problems			1
we had stared into the abyss of a complete failure of the international financial system , and managed – via huge state intervention – to avoid total collapse			2
the recovery of the @entity23 since then has been extraordinary			2
we have outperformed every other major economy			2
former @entity26 ally @entity25 ( pictured ) is now supporting the @entity27 in the election when i speak to investors and business people around the world , they see the recent @entity23 story as something of a miracle			1
the jobs figures alone are astounding : 2 million more people are in work – a figure representing many , many personal triumphs			2
businesses are starting in record numbers			2
i really believe @entity44 and @entity45 deserve much of the credit for this incredible turnaround			1
but back to ten years ago			2
in 2005 i supported @entity2 because they had ended the tyranny of ' or ' – the idea that you could only have a strong and growing economy ' or ' a fair and compassionate society			1
@entity2 recognised that the one helped pay for the other ; healthy tax receipts from business meant more money for schools , hospitals and helping the poorest in our country			1
put simply , @entity26 understood that in order to spend money , you first need to earn money			2
i 'm genuinely concerned that this view is n't shared by the current @entity66 – and that business is viewed as the problem , rather than the essential engine that gives politicians the ability to provide that fair and compassionate society			1
what 's more , they do not seem to understand how businesses work			2
take their energy - freeze policy			2
this betrays a basic misunderstanding of how markets work			0
companies would have elevated prices in anticipation of a freeze – and kept them high despite the recent drop in the price of oil			0
this is just one clumsy intervention that would end up costing people money			0
the current @entity91 has made it very clear that the @entity23 is open for business and endeavours to make business welcome here			1
it 's vital , because fundamentally , the business world is driven by confidence and positive sentiment			1
the former @entity102 boss said mr @entity44 deserved credit for turning around the economy however , it is very fragile and hard to nurture , and the mobility of the modern business world means a tech firm can start up as easily in @entity109 or @entity110 as they can in @entity112 , so they 're not going to pick a place which they perceive will make it hard for them to thrive			1
we need a government that backs business , not one that views us as cartoon capitalists ; a necessary evil to bring in money at best ; the embodiments of greed at worst			1
because the truth is the vast majority of those working in business are trying to build something good and to employ more people			1
there is such a thing as turning an honest profit			0
the man running a local bakery and employing ten people is a capitalist			0
the woman starting up a tech firm in her attic is a capitalist			0
these people are doing our economy and our society a service			0
they are not to be stigmatised but backed			1
i 'm backing the conservatives for this election as they 've shown a determination to stick to the course even when the tide of opinion was turning against them			1
a couple of years ago , a chorus of voices were urging @entity45 to change direction			0
he ignored them , the plan paid off , and now those same people are patting him on the back for his resolve			1
i like what they 've done for small businesses too			0
everyone 's got to start somewhere			0
i started selling mobile phones from my flat			0
and in the age of the start - up , government has to make life easier for people to get going			0
he said the current @entity66 , under @entity176 , viewed business as the problem , rather than the essential engine that gives politicians the ability to provide that fair and compassionate society i was speaking to an @entity184 contact recently who told me that anyone starting a small business in @entity184 gets sucked into a quagmire of bureaucracy , treated like some massive enterprise with their own accounting department			1
he could n't believe that in @entity23 you could get online and register your company in a few short steps – and that is to the @entity148 ' credit			1
most of all i like the confidence that is growing in our economy			0
what the economist @entity203 called ' animal spirits ' ; what used to be called the feel - good factor ; whatever you call it , that can - do feeling has been returning			0
economic success is n't decided on high , it is the collective result of millions of people feeling that we are heading in the right direction ; willing to take chances and work hard to succeed			1
this confidence has returned , beyond doubt – but we must make no mistake , it is a very fragile thing			0
indeed , it still has n't returned to many of our near neighbours			0
i 'm not a party loyalist and i have never donated money to any party			0
but on this occasion i really felt i had to speak out as our economic recovery truly hangs in the balance			1
for me the choice is clear			0
and it is not a choice between backing business on the one hand and promoting fairness on the other			1
there is nothing progressive about attacking business and undermining our economy			1
if the economy fails , frankly it is not the richest who suffer , it 's the poorest			0
it would be a huge and tragic irony if well - meaning people ended up hurting the most deprived in our country			0
but that is what i fear would happen with a @entity2 - @entity256 government – one that is anti-business , anti-aspiration and pro-spending money we have n't even earned yet			1
it comes down to this : we have come a long way in the past five years			0
clawing our way out of recession has meant a lot of hard work and sacrifice			0
we are rounding the corner and really getting somewhere as a country – and we would be crazy to throw it all away now .			0

@entity25 backed @entity2 in 2005 election , but now supports @entity276
@entity278 deserved credit for *remarkable* economic turnaround
*admired* @entity276 for sticking with plan even when opinion was against them
@entity285 under @entity176 *wrongly* saw business as ' the problem '
