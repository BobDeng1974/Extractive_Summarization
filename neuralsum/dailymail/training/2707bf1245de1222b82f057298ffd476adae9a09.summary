breastfeeding can halve the risk of children being obese by the age of eight , a study says			1
the risk of children being overweight is also cut by around 15 per cent in those breastfed for six months , compared with those fed formula milk			1
only a small number of women in the @entity11 breastfeed for long periods , with less than two per cent of babies being breastfed exclusively for six months			1
benefits : the risk of children being overweight is cut by around 15 per cent in those breastfed a new study from @entity19 says breastfeeding should be encouraged ' even in developed countries ' because of the long - term impact on weight gain among children			1
previous research shows breast milk protects babies against stomach bugs , chest infections , asthma , and allergies , and confers health advantages in later life , with some studies suggesting a small cut in the risk of obesity			1
but only a small number of women in the @entity11 breastfeed their babies for long periods and the number of new mums starting in 2011 fell slightly to 73.9 per cent			1
less than two per cent of babies are breastfed exclusively for six months			2
researchers carried out a study involving 43,000 @entity19 children where they had information about their feeding during infancy around 2001			0
they measured for underweight , normal weight , overweight , and obesity at 7 and 8 years of age defined by using international cut - off points of body mass index by sex and age			2
around 20 per cent of children in the study were exclusively breastfed for six months			2
the study found exclusive breastfeeding for the first six or seven months of life compared with formula feeding led to a reduced risk of overweight and obesity among school children			1
encouragement : researchers say women should breastfeed for longer , even though it is less fashionable than it once was at the age of seven , breastfed children were 15 per cent less likely to be overweight and 45 per cent less at risk of obesity			2
the reduction in risk of becoming overweight was similar at the age of eight , but the chances of being obese were even lower with a cut in risk of 55 per cent			2
the study took account of factors affecting children such as sex , television viewing time , and computer game playing time and maternal factors including educational attainment , smoking status , and working status			0
the study led by @entity92 , of the @entity93 , @entity94 , and pharmaceutical sciences , @entity96 , was published in the journal @entity98			0
dr @entity92 said ' breastfeeding is associated with decreased risk of overweight and obesity among school children in @entity19			1
' therefore , it would be better to encourage breastfeeding even in developed countries			0
' breastfeeding is known to be associated with slower weight gain which appears to establish healthier eating patterns - while it is thought infant formula increases the production of fat cells , fuelling weight gain throughout childhood			0
latest figures for @entity115 show one in 10 children was obese when they started school in 2011			0
the proportion doubled to almost 20 per cent among children going to senior school at the ages of 10 and 11 in the same year			0
later problems : breastfeeding can ease difficulties with overweight children overall @entity126 , former nurse and midwife and independent breast feeding counsellor , said mothers who can breastfeed their babies easily are giving them a great start in life			0
she said ' but most women who give up find it too difficult to continue			0
' they are not unaware of the benefits to the baby , they have been brainwashed into thinking if they do n't their baby will miss out and it can be a very worrying time			0
' but many find it too difficult to continue and they do n't get long - term support			0
' the @entity11 has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in @entity145 , with almost one in four new mothers never attempting to breastfeed compared with two per cent in @entity148			1
by four months old , 75 per cent of babies in @entity11 drink formula rather than breast milk .			1

exclusive breastfeeding for first six months reduced risk of obesity
@entity11 has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in @entity145
