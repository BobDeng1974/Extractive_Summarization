@entity0 believes @entity1 will only become a threat on the global stage once they stop being pleased just to have avoided a hammering against the big guns			1
@entity1 put on a brave display as they held @entity9 for large chunks of @entity11 at @entity12 before eventually losing 24 - 16			1
they even had a chance to put themselves on the brink of victory but saw skipper @entity18 pull his penalty wide before the all - conquering @entity9 stormed downfield to score the try which put the game out of sight			1
@entity0 breaches the @entity9 defence to score @entity1 's try on saturday the defeat means @entity1 ’s 109 - year wait for their first win against the world champions goes on			1
but there were clear signs of progress in @entity34 ’s young side			0
however , @entity36 — who scored to put the hosts 7 - 5 up after 12 minutes — insists if the @entity39 are happy to just come close , they will never win			1
‘ we have to be pleased with the consistency levels we have shown over the last two weeks and we have to be pleased with the performance , ’ he said			0
‘ but we have got to stop being a side that allows itself to take positives when you lose to the best team in the world , because if you do that you start drawing lines that you ca n’t cross			2
@entity0 , leaving the pitch after a 24 - 16 loss , says coming close to rugby 's big guns is n't enough ‘ we ca n’t keep saying we are pleased with “ this much ” , because if you come up against a side and your only aim is to come close , it will never be good enough			1
‘ we want to become a consistent threat and allow ourselves to be disappointed by the narrow margins			0
‘ once you do that you can really push on			0
’ the @entity39 were 17 - 16 down with 13 minutes left when @entity18 missed a kick that could have put them within touching distance of victory			1
but the @entity9 came back and @entity67 found a rare gap in the home defence to score the winning try			2
‘ it was an opportunity for us to make history			0
@entity18 had chance to give @entity1 the lead with 13 minutes to go but pushed it wide @entity67 crosses for a late try that saw the @entity9 ' slender one - point lead stretch to eight that does n’t come along very often , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we spoke a lot about that before the game but did n’t let the occasion take over us			0
we wanted to go out and fight for a win that had never been done before			2
‘ unfortunately we came up just shy			0
’ @entity1 face @entity83 next on saturday , but will be without centre @entity84 , due to a hamstring injury			2
@entity36 and @entity18 are among those who require further treatment .			0
