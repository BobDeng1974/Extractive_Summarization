a boy with leukaemia has received hundreds of postcards from around the world , after his family had to cancel their holiday plans so he could have chemotherapy			1
the family 's plea for postcards for @entity11 went viral and he has been inundated with post from strangers who were touched by his story			1
the seven - year - old from @entity17 , @entity18 , was crushed when he found out his summer holiday abroad had been cancelled so he could undergo chemotherapy			1
@entity27 left a post on @entity33 asking all his friends to send a postcard to @entity11 too and this family set up a @entity33 page encouraging strangers to send cards too			1
their plea went viral and so far @entity11 has received almost 700 postcards in just over a week			1
he has been sent postcards from six different continents , in dozens of languages and the campaign has even been supported by actors , @entity48 and @entity49 ‘ we ’ve been blown away by the response - @entity11 is getting more than 50 postcards a day delivered , ’ mr @entity11 said			1
‘ luckily , we have a very understanding postman			0
@entity11 ( pictured left with his postcards ) was crushed when he found out his summer holiday abroad had been cancelled so he could undergo chemotherapy , but a post on @entity33 asking for his uncle to send him a postcard went viral and now he 's receiving 50 postcards daily			1
@entity11 is pictured with the postman ( right ) @entity25 said : ' @entity11 's community nurse said she has n't seen him so bouncy for a long time			1
children as young as four have sent him cards , which is lovely			2
a doctor in @entity31 sent him some dr @entity68 books too , which he loved			0
' @entity11 is pictured with his father @entity25 and mother @entity70 lymphoblastic leukaemia is a cancer of the lymphocytes , which are a type of white blood cells that fight viral infections			1
symptoms show themselves slowly and become more severe as the number of immature white blood cells in the blood increases			0
they include : pale skin , tiredness , breathlessness , having repeated infections over a short space of time and unusual and frequent bleeding			0
the disease means that a person ’s bone marrow releases large number of immature white blood cells known as blast cells , which rapidly disrupt the normal balance of cells in the blood			0
this means that the body does not have enough red blood cells or platelet cells and its white cells are less effective at fighting bacteria and viruses			0
around 650 people in the @entity106 have lymphoblastic leukaemia			0
while it is uncommon overall , it 's the most common type of cancer to affect children			0
approximately 1 in every 2,000 children will develop it and 85 % will be cured			0
‘ when the first few arrived , we made a little map , and @entity11 was going to put a sticker on the map where each card came from			2
‘ but two days later , there were far too many stickers - we ’ve just had to put a sticker on each country			0
‘ @entity11 ’s mother @entity70 and i have been completely blown away by how thoughtful people have been			2
‘ we wanted to take @entity11 ’s mind off his chemo , as it ’s fairly nasty , and he has thrown himself into this			2
’ @entity11 was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukaemia in march and doctors warned he faced more than three years of treatment to rid his body of the cancer			2
‘ since march , @entity11 has been treated with seven different types of chemotherapy and has spent time in hospital on four different occasions with suspected infections , ' his father said			1
the programme of intense chemotherapy , which lasts for six months , has left @entity11 very weak and struggling to walk or write			2
because of ‘ particularly intensive block of treatment , we are unable to take him away on holiday , ' ms @entity144 wrote on the @entity11 's @entity33 page			1
' his latest blood test has shown that he is now neutropenic and has no immune system			0
this means we now have to keep him away from any possible infections ... chances are we will now spend the rest of the summer holidays at home ' to pass the time , @entity11 reads the messages sent to him from as far away as @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity31 and @entity162			1
' @entity11 ’s community nurse said she has n’t seen him so bouncy for a long time			1
it ’s definitely helping , ' he continued			0
‘ children as young as four have sent him cards , which is lovely and a woman in @entity31 sent him some dr @entity68 books too , which he loved			0
@entity11 has been sent postcards from six different continents , in dozens of languages and the campaign has even been supported by actors , @entity48 ( pictured left ) and @entity49 ( pictured right ) ' @entity11 is now crossing off countries as he gets postcards from them - he wants to have one from someone in every country in the world , ' his father said			1
here he takes delivery of more postcards from the postman @entity11 's father hoped that the postcards would take his son 's mind of the ' nasty ' course of chemotherapy and at first they marked where all the postcards were sent from on a map ( pictured left ) before more arrived ( right ) ‘ @entity11 is now crossing off countries as he gets postcards from them - he wants to have one from someone in every country in the world			1
‘ the way it has taken off has really restored our faith in humanity			0
when @entity11 was first diagnosed , we were all devastated			2
it ’s lovely that something like this can come out of something so horrible			0
‘ he ’s had postcards from @entity208 survivors across the world telling him to keep fighting - it ’s been tremendously encouraging			0
‘ he and his sister @entity212 , six , are looking forward to taking the postcard collection into school to show their teachers in september - although they ’ve had a couple of postcards from members of staff at the school already			2
