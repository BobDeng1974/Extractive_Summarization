by @entity0 published : 13:33 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 15:22 est , 4 december 2013 the controversial sweetener aspartame has effectively been cleared as safe to eat by @entity3 experts following human feeding trials			1
human guinea pigs were fed cereal snack bars , some of which contained the artificial sweetener , by a team of researchers at @entity12			1
the study recruited 50 people who had reported reactions after consuming aspartame in the past , such as headaches and nausea			2
safe : @entity20 announced that as a result of the @entity24 research , the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) had decided there is no need to ban or control the sale or consumption of the sweetener there was also a control group of another 50 others who have eaten aspartame in food and fizzy drink over many years without any ill - effects			1
however , the investigation found no evidence of harm in either those who reported past sensitivity to aspartame or the control group			2
significantly , this was a so - called double - blind trial where neither the trial participants or the researchers knew which of the bars was being eaten			2
yesterday , the @entity20 announced that as a result of the @entity24 research , the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) had decided there is no need to ban or control the sale or consumption of the sweetener			1
the @entity20 said : ‘ the expert committee concluded that ' the results presented did not indicate any need for action to protect the health of the public '			1
’ the government watchdog has not released the full details of the research because they remain confidential until they have been published in a peer reviewed journal			0
and despite concluding there is no reason to protect consumers , the @entity20 said the committee had not carried out an overall safety evaluation of aspartame a separate safety evaluation is being conducted by the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) , which is due to be published this month			1
the @entity20 said it will send the results of the @entity24 trial to @entity70 , so they can be taken into account			1
the conclusions of the experts on the @entity21 are unlikely to satisfy the many critics of aspartame , who include @entity78 , professor of science policy at the @entity80			2
he insists there is good quality independent research projects that have identified potential problems , ranging from premature births in women who enjoy diet drinks , to cancer			0
prof @entity78 , of the university ’s @entity90 unit , believes that @entity70 ’s evaluation is biased in favour of aspartame			2
@entity95 drinks : an @entity97 funded project published in 2010 found pregnant women who down cans of fizzy drink containing artificial sweeteners appear to be at greater risk of having a premature baby he claims the @entity70 panel set up to carry out the safety assessment is dominated by experts linked to manufacturers or regulators that have previously supported aspartame			1
the professor pointed to several studies that raise real questions about the safety of aspartame and justify the need for further research			0
an @entity97 funded project published in 2010 found pregnant women who down cans of fizzy drink containing artificial sweeteners appear to be at greater risk of having a premature baby ,			1
it is rare for a mother to be to give birth early - before 37 weeks - assuming all aspects of the pregnancy have been normal			0
the research found this low risk was increased by 38per cent if the woman was drinking an average of one can of diet drink a day			0
the statistics , gathered by academics in @entity136 , showed that a woman who routinely drank at least four cans a day could increase the risk by as much as 78per cent			0
this meant that if the risk of a premature birth was normally one in a 100 , it increased to 1.78 in 100			0
the professor also highlighted work by the independent @entity148 in @entity149 , which has published research suggesting aspartame caused several types of cancer in rats at doses very close to the current acceptable daily intake for humans			0
the concern about artificial sweeteners , such as aspartame , relates to the fact that they contain methanol			1
methanol is a nerve toxin , which can be metabolised in the body to form formic acid , which is another nerve toxin , as well as formaldehyde , which is the chemical used to preserve dead bodies			0
all of these research studies have formed part of the @entity70 review			0
a paper detailing the review ’s draft conclusions found they did not identify a health risk .			0

human guinea pigs were fed snack bars which contained the sweetener
@entity20 say there is no need to ban aspartame
the concern about artificial sweeteners relates to fact they contain methanol
