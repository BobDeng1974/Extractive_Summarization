a @entity1 cosmonaut has taken a stand against sexism by hitting back at a reporter who asked her questions about her hair and make - up ahead of her mission into space			1
@entity9 was swift to chastise the offending member of the press after they made the comment at a @entity15 conference to mark the imminent launch of the joint @entity18 - @entity1 mission to the @entity19 ( @entity19 )			2
in the video clip of the press conference which is quickly gaining traction online , a visibly frustrated and embarrassed @entity9 challenges the journalist , asking why they have not asked her fellow male astronauts similar questions			1
@entity9 was obviously unimpressed by the nature of questions directed at her during the press conference @entity9 was swift to chastise the offending member of the press after they made the comment the type of questions asked of @entity9 were very different to those asked of her male co-astronauts @entity37 ( left ) and @entity38 ( centre ) the 38 - year - old , who studied at @entity41 , will serve as a flight engineer aboard the @entity19 as well as biophysics and medical experiments about the effect of being in orbit			1
she is only the fourth @entity1 woman ever to be launched into space , and the first ever on the @entity19 given the serious nature of her mission , and the extensive training @entity9 has undergone , it is not surprising that she became frustrated when asked inane and totally unrelated questions simply based on her gender			2
‘ you are the first woman cosmonaut in 17 years , so what are you expecting from that flight ? are you going to take make - up with you ? clearly irritated by the question , @entity9 first simply chooses to ignore it , instead correcting the journalist on their facts			0
‘ answering the second part of your question about women cosmonauts i would like to make a correction			0
i will be the first @entity1 woman cosmonaut on the @entity19 ’ however when asked another question , @entity9 answers back directly			0
@entity9 , 38 , ( centre ) who studied at @entity41 , will serve as a flight engineer aboard the @entity19 the highly qualified cosmonaut was visibly annoyed to be asked questions about her hair and make - up a second journalist asks : ‘ can you tell us about your day - to - day life on the station ? for example how are you planning to do your hair ? ’ ‘ and i have a question for you ! why do n’t you ask about @entity38 ’s ( a male cosmonaut ) hair ? this is my answer i ’m sorry			1
’ @entity9 was launched into space today in the @entity85 spacecraft at the @entity86 in @entity87 , accompanied by @entity15 ’s @entity37 and @entity1 @entity38			0
the group docked safely on the @entity19 earlier today she is expected to remain on the @entity19 for six months and many of the questions asked of @entity9 focused on the fact that she will be separated from her 11 - year - old daughter during the trip			2
although @entity9 answers the questions calmly and in detail , the nature of the questions asked of her have riled heckles in feminist circles , especially since both her fellow astronauts also have children .			0

@entity9 is only the fourth @entity1 women to enter space
the highly trainer engineer is expected to spend six months on the @entity19
questions during the pre launch press conference focused on her hair
she was also asked if she would be taking make - up into space
others questioned her *decision* to leave her daughter , though her fellow male astronauts also have children
obviously frustrated , @entity9 eventually asked reporters why they did *n't* ask her male *counterparts* about their hair
