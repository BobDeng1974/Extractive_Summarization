@entity0 has vowed to make @entity1 stronger after accepting @entity2 had to go			1
the @entity1 manager signalled @entity2 ’s departure after @entity5 agreed to pay the striker ’s £ 75million buy - out clause and he will be unveiled next week close to the @entity8 following a medical			1
@entity2 , last season ’s @entity11 top scorer and winner of the @entity14 and @entity15 ’ @entity17 awards , pleaded for understanding from @entity1 fans who idolised the @entity20 but who had also grown increasingly exasperated at the controversy he courted throughout his three - and - a - half - year stay			1
@entity0 , who stood by @entity2 after he bit @entity41 ’s @entity40 last year , said : ‘ the club have done all they can over a sustained period of time to try to keep @entity2 at @entity1			1
‘ it is with great reluctance and following lengthy discussions we have eventually agreed to his wishes to move to @entity51 for new experiences and challenges			1
’ @entity0 faces the task of replacing a player who scored 31 goals last season and led @entity1 to the brink of the @entity11 title			1
@entity61 striker @entity60 and @entity63 ’s @entity62 are his early targets			0
but @entity0 promised : ‘ i am confident we will improve the team further and will be stronger for this coming season			2
if there is one thing the history of this great club teaches us , it is that @entity1 is bigger than any individual			1
i hope our supporters continue to dream and believe that we are moving forward and with continued improvement and progression , together we will bring the success we all crave and deserve			0
’ if the shirt fits : @entity5 staff have already got on the job of printing @entity82 9 shirts putting their shirt on him : @entity5 staff have already got on the job of printing @entity82 9 jerseys @entity2 , who will sign a five - year deal worth around £ 200,000 a week , said he was leaving with a heavy heart			1
in a statement he added : ‘ i hope you can all understand why i have made this decision			0
this club did all they could to get me to stay but playing and living in @entity51 , where my wife ’s family live , is a lifelong dream and ambition			2
i believe now the timing is right			0
‘ it is with a heavy heart that i leave @entity1 for a new life and new challenges in @entity51			1
both me and my family have fallen in love with this club and with the city but most of all i have fallen in love with the incredible fans			0
‘ you have always supported me and we , as a family , will never forget it , we will always be @entity1 supporters			2
i am very proud i have played my part in helping to return @entity1 to the elite of the @entity11 and in particular back into the @entity113			0
‘ thank you again for some great moments and memories			0
’ bye bye : @entity2 will move to @entity5 from @entity1 in a £ 75million deal the deal will be the third biggest in football history after @entity122 ’s £ 86m move from @entity123 to @entity124 and @entity126 ’s £ 80m transfer from @entity127 to @entity124 in 2009			1
there were fears @entity5 would try to negotiate a lower fee due to the player ’s indiscretions but @entity1 ’s owners @entity133 were prepared to resist all offers below the buy - out clause , which was inserted for foreign clubs during contract renegotiations last december			1
@entity1 made it clear in the first meeting with @entity5 that they did not wish to endure a saga similar to the one that followed @entity145 ’s bid for @entity2 last summer			1
the only negotiation remained the structure of the payment particularly once it became clear that @entity149 did not wish to be part of the transfer			0
@entity2 is now facing a fight to appeal his four - month ban , described by his lawyer as ‘ draconian , totalitarian and fascist ’ with an appeal going to the @entity156			1
decision : @entity2 has 10 days to request the full written reasons for the appeal being rejected by @entity159 the ban prohibits @entity2 from attending football matches , training with @entity162 or his club and attending functions organised by his team — a penalty now borne by @entity5			2
@entity2 ’s lawyer @entity167 said : ‘ we hope they revoke this sanction that is blatantly draconian , totalitarian and fascist			2
the right of a footballer to work is being violated , and football should be worried about that			0
the nine international games may seem excessive , but the fact that he ca n’t watch a game of football , or train or carry out his job , we are talking about unpleasant things			0
‘ @entity2 recognised his error but we ’ve seen that for @entity159 saying sorry is not an important factor , ’ added @entity167			2
‘ justice will take its time but it will come			0
we knew that @entity159 would uphold the ban because they are corporatists			0
we will not stop , we are going to go to the @entity156 and we will keep taking the juridical path that is available to us			0
’ for @entity1 , @entity2 is no longer their problem			2
chance : @entity2 could still get his ban put on hold via the @entity197			0
