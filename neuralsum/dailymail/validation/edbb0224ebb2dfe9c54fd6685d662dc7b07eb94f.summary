police have been accused of creating a ‘ charter for criminals ’ with a scheme that allows officers to ignore low - value offences			1
the powers mean they can dismiss a crime if the investigation cost outweighs the value of the item stolen or damaged			1
victims have been told that unless the stolen object exceeds £ 50 in value , police do not have to bother with an investigation			1
police have been accused of creating a ‘ charter for criminals ’ with a scheme that allows officers to ignore low - value offences ( file picture ) last night the move was roundly condemned by @entity24 , anti-crime campaigners and criminologists who said the scheme handed offenders a ‘ licence to steal ’			1
they said the police power of ‘ discretionary disposal ’ could forever change the criminal justice system which was founded on a principle of caution or prosecute			1
@entity35 , a businessman who had his fridge stolen , was stunned to hear police would not investigate as it was worth less than £ 50			1
the 50 - year - old , of @entity39 , @entity40 , was selling the fridge on @entity42 , with the buyer picking it up from his flat			0
the fridge was loaded into his van and he told mr @entity35 he would secure it and then pay him			0
instead , he drove away			0
mr @entity35 called police , giving them the vehicle registration , the man ’s name and description and details of his @entity42 account			2
@entity35 ( pictured ) was told police would not investigate the theft of his fridge because it was worth less than £ 50 but he received a letter a few days later from @entity59 , which read : ‘ i am sorry to inform you that the theft that you reported will not be investigated due to the low value of the fridge ( £ 16.00 ) as the cost of the investigation would outweigh the cost of the item stolen			1
‘ the crime report will be closed using the @entity70 method as it is not in the public interest to pursue the offender			2
’ mr @entity35 said : ‘ i was absolutely astonished police have been handed the power … it is a charter for criminals , a licence to commit crimes			1
' they could make a mint stealing items under the value of £ 50 and never face a courtroom			0
’ he added : ‘ this anoints police the judge and jury … criminals who can be pursued and brought to justice will simply escape unpunished to go on to more serious and larger crimes			1
’ discretionary disposals , created to save policing costs , were first introduced in @entity93 and have yet to be widely used on the @entity95 mainland			0
but critics expressed concern that the power was an option at all			0
@entity100 , criminologist and founder of think - tank @entity102 , said : ‘ in areas where there are problems of disorder it could end up tipping the balance in favour of the criminal element as opposed to the law - abiding			0
’ @entity113 , @entity114 mp of the @entity115 , said the disposals send ‘ a signal that crime is ok and will be tolerated at a certain level ’ , adding : ‘ if we let this take root then we are looking at criminal justice from the wrong end of the telescope			2
’ others said the powers had been introduced by stealth to avoid public outcry and called for an explanation from the @entity131			0
a spokesman for @entity133 said : ‘ this is a preposterous scheme … it ’s time the @entity131 stamped it out			2
’ a @entity131 spokesman said : ‘ this government expects all police forces to investigate all crimes reported to them			2
’ @entity59 stood by the use of discretionary disposal , which it introduced two years ago , but said it was wrongly applied in mr @entity35 ’s case – and would make ‘ further enquiries ’			0
a spokesman said the scheme allowed officers to focus on the ‘ most serious ’ crimes , not those ‘ highly unlikely to be detected ’ .			0
