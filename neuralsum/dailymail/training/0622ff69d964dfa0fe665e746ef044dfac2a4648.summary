playing music to an egg in a dish in an ivf lab increased the chances of it being fertilised by 5 per cent , a study found			1

helping hand : it is known as the food of love - and now it has emerged that music may boost the odds of @entity8 success they think the vibrations may ease the passage of nutrients into the egg and speed the removal of toxic waste , so increasing the odds of fertilisation taking place and the embryo surviving			1
while fully - grown humans may be fussy about the type of music they listen to , embryos are n’t so picky			2
pop , classical and heavy metal were equally good , the @entity40 ’s annual conference in @entity41 heard			0
the scientists , from the @entity47 fertility clinic in @entity48 , injected sperm into almost 1,000 eggs and put them on dishes in incubators			2
they then placed ipods in half the incubators and left them playing music including pop songs by @entity58 and @entity59 , heavier tracks from @entity61 and @entity62 and classical works by @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
star : scientists placed ipods in incubators and left them playing music including pop songs by @entity58 and @entity59 , pictured when they checked the dishes , they found that fertilisation rates were higher in the incubators in which music had been played			1
researcher @entity75 said : ‘ when we work in an @entity8 lab , we try to mimic the conditions in the womb in terms of light and temperature			0
‘ for instance , we work in low light but nobody has studied the effect of sound			0
’ embryos do n’t develop the ability to hear for at least 14 weeks , so dr @entity75 thinks that the vibrations produced by the music are key			1
@entity92 , an @entity93 fertility expert said that while the idea might sound bizarre , it could have some scientific basis			0
he said : ‘ @entity97 produced using @entity8 sit on a dish , stewing in their own juices but those produced naturally are wafted down the fallopian tubes , rocking and rolling all their way to the uterus			0
‘ this movement means that the embryo experiences a very dynamic environment , which may have some advantages , particularly in terms of getting rid of waste products			0
‘ the vibrations caused by music may stimulate this effect			2
‘ one might speculate that techno music , with its pounding bass beat might do the best job of all			0
