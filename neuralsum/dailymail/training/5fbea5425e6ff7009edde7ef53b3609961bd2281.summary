@entity0 and @entity1 were ordered to get tough on immigration today – or lose even more support to @entity4 following last night ’s shock by - election results			1
@entity8 ’s party handed the @entity9 a drubbing in @entity11 – and only narrowly missed out on a second win in the safe @entity14 seat of @entity15 and @entity16 after a dramatic late surge in support for @entity4			1
@entity20 defector @entity19 became the party 's first elected mp , winning his @entity24 constituency with a 12,404 majority , while @entity14 's @entity26 held on in @entity27 by just 617 votes			1
@entity20 and @entity29 united today to urge their party leaders to take action on immigration to show they understood why voters were turning to @entity4			1
@entity8 today called for all immigrants with ' life threatening ' illnesses to be blocked from coming to the @entity37 it comes after immigration figures showed @entity0 was losing his battle to reduce net immigration to ‘ tens of thousands ’ a year – which he pledged at the last election			1
official figures show the number of migrants arriving in @entity37 outstrips those leaving by almost 250,000 a year – similar to the levels seen under @entity14 after the borders were opened to eastern @entity52 migrants in 2004			2
shadow health secretary @entity53 said : ‘ there is more we need to do to listen to people who are voting @entity4 , particularly on immigration and i ’d be the first to say that			1
’ he said : ‘ in my own constituency there will be traditional @entity14 voters with the same concerns about immigration – absolutely we need to hear those concerns and act on their concerns			1
’ mr @entity53 said he could not defend immigrants ‘ sending back benefits ’ to their families in @entity52			2
he said : ‘ i think it does n't meet most people 's test of basic fairness , you know , that you have n't contributed but then you can take out			2
and that has to change			0
‘ i think what they do n't agree with is the idea that people can then just arrive and take benefits and send them back , and that needs to change			0
and @entity1 and @entity84 have both said it needs to change			0
’ labour leader @entity1 today said it was not prejudiced to be concerned about immigration - but insisted capping the number of migrants coming to @entity37 would not work @entity20 local government minister @entity89 insisted the government were acting to cut migration			1
he said the conservatives would put immigration ‘ at the heart ’ of renegotiation ahead of the @entity94 referendum in 2017			2
‘ what people are worried about though is that migration from the @entity94 , and the prime minister as i say made it very clear last week that 's got to be one of the key things at the heart of renegotiation that we will have before that referendum which we will deliver in 2017			1
’ @entity14 mp @entity106 challenged @entity1 to ‘ step up to the mark ’ after the surge in support for @entity4 in yesterday ’s two by - elections			1
he said : ‘ people want action , not listening , on the big issues – and the big issues include immigration			2
‘ people feel that the speed of immigration into this country is too fast , that the price that people are paying in terms of lower pay , in terms of forced housebuilding in areas in the north is too big			2
‘ and we need some action to demonstrate that @entity14 not just is listening , but is prepared to do something on these concerns			2
‘ what he should say is that we want to have and will get back from @entity52 the right to determine the numbers coming in and the skills coming in so that we have that power			0
‘ that ’s the fundamental change that ’s needed			0
and so , yes , at the moment , that would mean a reduction in numbers without question			0
’ the prime minister is failing to fulfil his pledge to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 a year @entity19 was one of the most prominent @entity145 @entity20 mps but his defection to @entity4 in august was still a major surprise in @entity148			1
the libertarian @entity11 mp regularly spoke out against the government on @entity52 , the economy and parliamentary reform			2
the maverick backbencher once led calls for @entity29 ' expenses to be opened up to the public – but was then criticised after it emerged he claimed cash back for a ' love chair ' for his home			0
in @entity11 his popularity outstrips that of the @entity9			2
one senior conservative said : ' there is not a @entity20 machine campaign machine in @entity11 , it is a @entity19 machine			1
' mr @entity19 grew up in @entity166 where his doctor parents worked			0
he was educated at @entity168 , @entity169 , before moving to the exclusive @entity171 boarding school in @entity172			0
fellow @entity14 mp @entity173 said @entity14 needed a stronger message on immigration to address the surge in support for @entity4			1
he said : ‘ but there are lessons in this by - election result			0
we were right to concentrate on the @entity183 ; we ’ve also , however , got to be stronger about our messages on immigration as well			0
’ @entity20 mp @entity185 claimed @entity4 voters needed to understand that the only way to get tougher controls on immigration was to vote @entity20			1
he said : ‘ the only way we ’re going to have that referendum , the only way we ’re going to deliver even tougher immigration controls , the only way we ’re going to continue to grow the economy in the way that we ’ve seen over the last few years is under a @entity20 government , under a conservative prime minister ; not under @entity19 , @entity8 , @entity1 , whoever it might be			1
’ fellow @entity20 backbencher @entity195 said politics needed ‘ far less fudging ’ and ‘ far more talking about how things really are ’			0
he said : ‘ for example , if you want to control @entity94 immigration we 're going to have to take back control over our borders			0
’ last night 's by - election results left @entity1 in pole position to be the next prime minister , mr @entity0 claimed today			1
the prime minister said : ‘ what last night demonstrates is that if you see a big @entity4 vote , you will end up with @entity1 as prime minister , @entity84 as chancellor and @entity14 in power			1
' @entity20 chairman @entity212 added : ‘ let me be blunt			0
what we have seen is a simple truth			0
this just puts @entity1 closer to victory			0
this has just made his job of getting into @entity219 easier			0
' mr @entity1 this afternoon appeared to agree with the @entity20 response			0
he said : ‘ the @entity9 are a party losing in their own backyard and retreating from what they used to call their own frontline			0
the @entity9 are a party that can not win a majority at the next general election			0
’ @entity19 ( pictured celebrating with @entity8 ) is @entity4 's first elected mp in the @entity228 @entity8 said @entity4 was making ' staggering gains in stridently @entity14 territory ' after mr @entity19 's victory @entity4 's next target is @entity233 and @entity234 , where mr @entity19 's fellow defector @entity235 is hoping to return to @entity237			1
mr @entity19 said : ' in @entity233 , as in @entity11 , i believe voters will reject negative campaigns by old party machines			2
' this morning mr @entity8 claimed more mps were likely to defect to @entity4 within the next few months - including @entity14 backbenchers .			1
