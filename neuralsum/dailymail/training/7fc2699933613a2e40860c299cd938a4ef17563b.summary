’ the @entity1 has rarely taken time off due to illness during her six decades as monarch			1

she has , however , suffered occasional problems with her back			2
in october , she was forced to cancel an appearance at a @entity19 investiture ceremony , and also had to miss a church service in @entity67 a few days earlier			1

’ honoured : @entity96 cycling coach @entity95 received a @entity97 at @entity1 's investiture ceremony strong : her majesty has always refused to fuss over a string of ailments over recent years leaders : although the @entity1 has suffered various illness and injury in recent years , it is the health of prince @entity39 that is more often in the spotlight the @entity1 ’s most recent appearance was to present a host of @entity96 stars with honours during an investiture ceremony at @entity18 on thursday			1
she and the @entity112 are scheduled to fly out to @entity113 for a two - day visit next week			1

the 91 - year - old was taken into hospital just hours before the @entity142 ’s closing celebrations at @entity18 , where she was joined by some 12,000 people			2

gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and bowel and is very common in @entity130 , with about one in five people affected every year			0
the two most common causes in adults are a virus , such as the norovirus , or food poisoning , according to @entity133			0
the infection interferes with one of the main functions of the intestines , the absorption of water from the contents of the intestines into the body			0
common symptoms of gastroenteritis include vomiting , diarrhoea and dehydration			0
most types of gastroenteritis are highly infectious , and bacteria can be transferred through poor hygiene , such as not washing your hands after going to the toilet			0
viruses and bacteria on hands can be transferred to whatever they touch , such as a glass , kitchen utensil or food			0
most people with gastroenteritis only have mild symptoms and the infection passes after a few days without the need for treatment			0
but sufferers may need treatment in hospital if symptoms are severe or if they are vulnerable because of their age or another illness			0
this is because diarrhoea can quickly cause dehydration which , if severe , can be fatal			0
each year in @entity130 and @entity9 , an average 190 deaths occur because of gastroenteritis			0
most deaths are in people over 65			0
worrying : it is unknown at this time whether @entity1 will be well enough to travel to @entity113 next week			1

her majesty to miss @entity5 's @entity15 celebrations
visit to @entity113 along with the @entity112 next week could be in doubt
the @entity1 will be spending the weekend at @entity19 , as usual
