by @entity0 published : 10:00 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 15:57 est , 19 february 2013 this time last year , children played on the bone - dry riverbed of the @entity4 in @entity5 as @entity6 was hit by widespread drought			1
but today , the same scene , just north of @entity9 , could not be more different - with the same river now full to the brim with flowing water			1
in february 2012 , the @entity13 was officially declared to be in a state of drought after @entity15 suffered from months of unseasonably dry weather over the winter			1
rivers and reservoirs were at their lowest level for 30 years and people were being urged by the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) to conserve water by taking four - minute showers and turning the tap off when brushing their teeth			1
that was then : last february , children were seen playing on the bone - dry riverbed of the @entity4 in @entity5 as @entity6 was struck by a drought this is now : today , the same scene , just north of @entity9 , is full to the brim with flowing water in february 2012 , the @entity13 was officially declared to be in a state of drought after @entity15 suffered from months of unseasonably dry weather over the winter in contrast to last year , six weeks ago , the @entity4 had a flood warning in place and @entity39 has said there are currently ' all - time high ' ground water levels around the area by april last year , 17 counties were give the label ' water stressed ' and many areas in the @entity13 and @entity13 experienced hosepipe bans			1
but by summer , the country was experiencing the wettest weather on record , with relentless rainfall across the @entity6			1
in total , 1095mm of rain fell over the course of the year			2
@entity39 lifted their hosepipe ban in june while @entity56 was one of the last to lift theirs in july after ' abnormally heavy rainfall '			0
in contrast to last year , six weeks ago on january 9 , the @entity4 had a flood warning in place and @entity39 has said there are currently ' all - time high ' ground water levels around the area			1
there are currently 24 flood alerts in place across the @entity13 as groundwater remains too high			2
but despite the concerns over flooding , the good news is that the chance of unpopular water restrictions being introduced is very low			0
the @entity73 said the chance of a hosepipe ban this year is ' extremely unlikely '			0
the huge amount of rain in 2012 means that the @entity13 - the region most at risk from drought - has enough water to get through two ' dry ' winters , according to the @entity73			1
it added that reservoirs were full and there should be no need to restrict water supplies or issue drought permits in 2013 , regardless of the weather			2
meanwhile , again at the exact same time last year , @entity89 in @entity90 was just 55 per cent full ( left ) , compared to now ( right ) water levels in february 2012 were 20 per cent lower than they should have been at @entity89 - the third largest reservoir in the country today , there is no shortage of water , and no danger of a hosepipe ban either at the exact same time this time last year , @entity89 in @entity90 was just 55 per cent full			1
the sign ' buoyancy aids must be worn beyond this point ' was rendered almost comical as it stood in the scorched earth			0
but now , it too can serve its purpose , surrounded by an abundance of water			0
water levels were 20 per cent lower than they should have been at @entity89 - the third largest reservoir in the country			1
@entity113 even had to apply for a winter drought permit for the first time in more than a decade , so it could drain extra water from the @entity117 to feed the reservoir in @entity89			2
a dragonfly sculpture gazes forlornly at the lack of water in @entity89 last year ... but it 's much happier now @entity113 even had to apply for a winter drought permit for the first time in more than a decade , so it could drain extra water from the @entity117 to feed the reservoir in @entity89 ( pictured last year ) a happier outlook from the water 's edge at @entity89 today in early 2012 , rivers and reservoirs were at their lowest level for 30 years and people were being urged by the @entity22 to conserve water by taking four - minute showers @entity89 this week , a year after drought was officially announced a policeman carries a child to safety at @entity136 , @entity137 , during the great floods of 1953 the @entity6 is ' better prepared than ever before ' to respond to major flooding , according to the environment minister			1
sixty years ago , the @entity141 battered the east coast of @entity15 as high spring tides , deep atmospheric low pressure and exceptionally strong northerly gales led to sea water surging over coastal defences and sweeping two miles inland			2
by the morning of february 1 , the death toll on land was estimated at 307 in @entity15 coastal towns and villages			0
many more died on the @entity152 and at sea			0
it has been named one of the country 's worst peace time disasters			0
speaking last month , environment minister @entity158 said : ' the floods of 1953 saw the terrible loss of over 300 lives and devastating damage to thousands of homes			0
' the tragedy was made all the worse by the fact that no flood warning system was in place			1
' today , people have a much better chance to protect their lives , loved ones and possessions and stay safe by signing up for the @entity73 flood warnings			2
' while the risk of extreme weather has never gone away , the country is better prepared than ever before to respond to major flooding and i thank the emergency services and @entity73 for their hard work during the recent floods			0
' the @entity73 said that , despite major improvements to sea defences and warning systems , 1.3 million people or one in 25 homes in @entity15 and @entity187 remain at risk of coastal flooding			0
the situation is likely to be exacerbated in coming years as a result of climate change , the agency added .			0

@entity4 near @entity9 , @entity5 dried up last february - but six weeks ago , it had a flood warning in place
water levels at @entity89 in @entity90 were 20 *%* lower than they should have been last year ... unlike today
reservoirs and rivers were at lowest level for 30 years in early 2012
but by summer , @entity6 was hit with the wettest weather on record
