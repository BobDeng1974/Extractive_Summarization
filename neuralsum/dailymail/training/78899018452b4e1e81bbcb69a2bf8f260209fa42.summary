they even stole my underpants , ’ says @entity3 , shaking his head			1
he is discussing the recent burglary at his @entity7 home			1
‘ there are some strange people around , ’ he says			1
my car , jewellery , three televisions , clothes , shoes			1
‘ i had champagne bottles in cases which were my man - of - the - match awards			1
they left the glass case and took the champagne			2
my car was found the next day but the most important things were my shirts , one from @entity23 and the other from @entity25			2
’ understandably , the events have left @entity3 feeling uneasy			1
he is not the only @entity28 player to be affected			1
@entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 have all fallen victim to break - ins			2
@entity3 ( right ) believes @entity28 are good enough to qualify for the @entity34 the 23 - year - old ( right ) has had to move into a hotel after his @entity7 home was recently burgled @entity38 : @entity38 has everything			1
he has power , strength , physique but he also has a velvet touch on the ball			2
he can make a terrific pass			2
@entity46 : @entity47 dances like a snake , the way he moves			2
you have to be careful timing your tackles , it ’s difficult to get the ball			2
@entity54 : i like the look of @entity57 at @entity58 , the way he roughs up defenders , but @entity62 is strong and a deadly finisher			2
the @entity64 has moved temporarily to a nearby hotel while his house is fitted with new alarms			1
‘ i need somewhere to feel safe and relaxed to concentrate on my game			2
home does n’t feel like home right now			2
’ the 23 - year - old is polite and softly spoken			1
he is frustrated though following the previous night ’s defeat at @entity73			2
it has been a tough week , the 1 - 0 loss at the @entity75 followed a 3 - 0 defeat by @entity77 and monday brings another acid test of their top - four credentials when they host @entity82 , the club @entity3 supported as a boy			1
‘ we feel we deserve to be where we are , ’ says @entity3 on @entity28 ’s lofty league position			1
‘ the squad is stronger than last season			2
our losses have come down to individual errors and not being clinical with our chances			2
that ’s the difference with the top sides			2
‘ @entity77 are the champions but they set out to defend against us because they know we keep possession well but they were deadly with their chances			0
at @entity73 we were unlucky , they have a magician in @entity46 and we were down to 10 men at a crucial time			0
‘ we deserve to be where we are			0
we have a few injuries too but we know we have to keep working to stay in the top four			0
’ despite off - field problems , @entity3 ( below ) has played a key role in @entity28 's great start to the season @entity3 ( right ) scored in @entity106 's famous 2 - 1 @entity34 win against @entity107 in november 2012 1 ) @entity38 @entity38 has everything			1

3 ) @entity54 i like the look of @entity57 at @entity58 , the way he roughs up defenders , but @entity62 is strong and a deadly finisher			0
@entity3 has already starred in the @entity34 at @entity106			1
his performances , including a goal in their famous 2 - 1 win over @entity107 in november 2012 , helped earn his £ 12.5million move to @entity28 18 months ago			1
the younger @entity28 players quiz him about what it was like			1
‘ @entity133 and @entity134 ask me about the games , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity107 was the highlight of my career so far			0
i tell them how fantastic it was and how great the atmosphere was			0
it is the best club competition in the world			0
‘ it means so much to players			0
some @entity107 players like @entity146 and @entity23 came to me and said “ well played ” but @entity147 was screaming how we had only defended and cheated them and @entity150 was in tears			0
’ beating a resurgent @entity82 on monday would go some way to reaffirming @entity28 as @entity34 contenders			1
the midfielder ( right ) is relishing the challenge of facing boyhood club @entity82 on monday @entity82 are a team he relishes facing			1
growing up in @entity159 , he dreamed of playing for them and it is a dream he still harbours			0

‘ he used to say “ when you ’ve been a footballer you can talk to me ’ ’ so i thought that ’s what i ’ll become			0
‘ @entity82 were my team			1
when their games were on we used to go to an old theatre where you had to pay to watch movies and then extra for @entity82 games			1
sometimes they would stop the movies to show @entity82 ’s match			1
‘ i had posters of @entity180 and @entity181 on my wall			0
they were my favourite players who i wanted to be			0
if i could take anything from them maybe it would be @entity180 ’s passion , his fire			0
i wanted to shake his hand after we played @entity189 the other week but i did n’t find him			0
it ’s a shame he has left			0
’ today @entity3 holds up @entity191 as his favourite @entity82 player			1
‘ he is the best @entity193 player			0
he is strong , powerful , he has that anger that drives his team			0
he lifts them , sometimes carries them			0
the type of guy you would always want on your side			0
’ @entity3 has hailed captain @entity191 as his favourite @entity82 player in the current team @entity3 feels comfortable rubbing shoulders with such illustrious company now			1
‘ i ’m confident but never relaxed			0
you ca n’t be relaxed in the @entity206 , there are too many teams who can trip you up , too many strong players			1

why not ? ’ @entity3 was also full of praise for @entity212 for helping him produce more consistent displays			1

@entity28 host @entity82 in the @entity206 on monday
saints sit one place and one point above @entity82 in the table in third
