' i want to apologize for a comment that i made on last night 's @entity3 about @entity1 's hair			1
' ' as you know , @entity3 is a show that pokes fun at celebrities in good spirit , but i do realize that something i said last night did cross the line			1
' ' i just want everyone to know that i did n't intend to hurt anybody , but i learned it 's not my intent that matters , ' @entity0 continued			1
' it 's the result			0
and the result is people are offended , including @entity1			1
and that is not okay			0
' ' therefore , i want to say to @entity1 , and anyone else out there that i hurt , that i 'm so sincerely sorry , ' she concluded			2
' this really has been a learning experience for me			0
i learned a lot today and this incident has taught me to be a lot more aware of cliches and stereotypes , and how much damage they can do			0
' ' and that i am responsible , as we all are , to not perpetuate them further			0
' furor erupted online on monday after @entity0 claimed @entity1 smelled of patchouli just because she has dreadlocks			1
the comments went further on the @entity8 special when the show cut to a picture of the singer on the red carpet - a voice off camera could be heard saying that the @entity11 star smelled like ' weed '			1

not because i was relishing in rave outfit reviews , but because i was hit with ignorant slurs and pure disrespect			0

' i was referring to a bohemian chic look			0
had nothing to do with race and never would ! ! ! ' this is not the first time @entity3 has come under fore for controversial remarks			2

@entity1 was n't the only entity @entity0 had a go at - she also flipped the bird at the entire @entity8 for leaving fashion police commissioner @entity180 out of the @entity226 segment during sunday 's @entity8			1
' screw them anyway for leaving @entity180 out of the @entity226 segment , ' she said brandishing both middle fingers			0
' @entity229 you , @entity8			0
' @entity0 's sudden outburst came without warning as she was criticizing the @entity8 for the white photo backdrop it provided , which prevented @entity234 's white gown from ' popping '			1
' let 's all blame them			0
let 's blame them for everything , ' she shouted			0
her fashion police co-hosts @entity65 , @entity242 - and the audience - cheered in agreement , while @entity245 added it was a ' miss ' for the @entity8			1
