@entity1 ’s experiment of having two coaches fell apart when tension arose between @entity4 and @entity5 over the need to rest the best players from one - day matches			2
now , things could be different			0
there is a strong case for @entity12 , an impressive assistant coach amid the rubble of this @entity14 , to be given extra responsibility for limited - overs cricket if @entity1 are bold and pick a largely different one - day team when they move on from this disaster			1
the primacy of test cricket remains an important principle but there is no doubt it has contributed to the worst @entity14 showing of them all			0
there is a strong case for @entity1 assistant coach @entity12 to be given extra responsibility @entity12 remains a firm believer that @entity1 coach @entity30 ( left ) will get it right if @entity1 are serious about closing a gap which has become a gaping chasm between them and the best one - day nations , they need to have completely different personnel to the test team			1
and @entity12 , who guided @entity38 to the @entity40 and @entity41 titles last year , has been a calm and sensible presence here			2
he remains a firm believer that @entity1 coach @entity30 will get it right - another reason the pair should be able to share coaching responsibilities			1
‘ it ’s unfair that @entity30 is the one in the limelight , ’ said @entity12 ahead of this morning ’s dead rubber against @entity48			2
@entity12 talks with @entity51 as the disastrous @entity14 campaign comes to a close @entity12 guided @entity38 to the @entity40 and @entity41 titles last year and is calm and sensible ‘ at the last @entity55 tournament , i left having been head coach of the team that won it and you take the adulation then			1
but you also receive the stick when things go badly			0
we ’re all responsible , not just @entity64			0
’ @entity12 also addressed the controversial subject of statistics , adding : ‘ when i was with @entity38 we had a lot more meetings and looked at stats a lot more than @entity1 do			1
’ @entity1 assistant coach @entity12 conducts fielding practice during an @entity1 nets session in @entity74 @entity75 has predicted @entity1 will suffer another whitewash in this summer ’s ashes			1

@entity1 experimented with having two coaches but it failed
@entity12 has impressed as assistant coach in an *awful* @entity14
he could take extra responsibility if @entity1 are bold enough to give him it
@entity12 helped guide @entity38 to *success* and believes in @entity30
@entity75 predicts @entity1 to suffer another @entity77 whitewash
