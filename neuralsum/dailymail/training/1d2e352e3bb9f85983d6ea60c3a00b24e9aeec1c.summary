by @entity0 published : 15:21 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 18:06 est , 13 december 2012 @entity1 has come under fire from child protection campaigners after its claims to have put effective safeguards on access to porn were called into question			0
the internet giant had changed its programming after earlier criticism so as to make x-rated pictures more difficult to find			1
but a trial carried out in the @entity14 by the @entity15 revealed that such images were still easily available.entering the word ' porn ' in a search on @entity1 brought up hundreds of x-rated pictures			1
restricted : @entity1 tweaked an algorithm for their image search database in the @entity14 making it harder to find explicit images giant : @entity1 , based in @entity25 , has become the biggest search engine in the world the result brings into question @entity1 's claim that users in the @entity14 would have to be more specific if they wanted to view porn			1
the changes had affected users in the @entity14 only			1
those in the @entity35 do not at present have the supposedly improved programming and there is no timetable to bring it in			2
@entity1 has also changed its ' @entity41 ' filters which allow users to completely block porn			0
in the @entity14 there are now only two options for pictures – filter all explicit results or not at all			2
@entity35 @entity1 users have three options , which are potentially confusing – no filtering , moderate or strict			1
@entity51 , a @entity52 mp who has convened @entity54 meetings on the misuse of the internet , said the simpler measures in the @entity14 should be used in @entity35 too			1
he said : ' parents need to be able to make a clear choice so they can do what they need to do			0
one system across the western world , including the @entity35 , seems sensible			2
' @entity63 , secretary of the children 's @entity64 on internet safety , added : ' it 's good to see @entity1 acknowledging the problem but let 's hope they get it right because the evidence so far is not conclusive			0
' restriction : @entity1 's search restriction is only in place in the @entity14 but the company said it hopes to roll - out the changes internationally the @entity15 is campaigning for an automatic block to protect children			1
under the plan over- 18s could access porn only if they ' opt in ' after a strict age verification check			0
a spokesman for @entity1 said : ' we aim not to show sexually explicit results unless a user is specifically searching for them			0
' despite @entity1 's aim ' not to show sexually - explicit results unless a user is specifically searching for them ' , users will notice little change			0
the restrictions , which have only been introduced in the @entity14 , only apply to @entity1 's ' image search '			1
further , @entity1 also said that the change applies on computers that have the ' safesearch ' setting activated - a mode that already attempts to filter graphic content from web searches			0
@entity99 last month expressed his desire to introduce restrictions on computers to prevent children from viewing online porn			0
the prime minister has rejected an automatic block on porn but has signalled his intention to set up opt - in controls for parents			0
the move follows increasing concern that children in the @entity35 are being exposed to graphic images at a young age			1
under @entity1 's new @entity14 measures , wide searches such as ' porn ' will return no results			2
but the company said that users could still find what they are looking for by using more specific terms			1
turning on the @entity41 filter in the @entity14 will now entirely wipe clean any results for search words like ' porn ' or ' boobs			2
' some internet - users in the @entity14 described the change as ' censorship ' and took to website 's such as @entity132 to criticise the company			1
one user named okeman wrote : ' you can take away our privacy , but if you mess with porn , the internet is going to be mad			0
' another wrote : ' oh great , now i have to explicitly state what i am looking for , which then gets saved to my search history so i ca n't pretend i just stumbled on it			0

search engine fails to makes it more difficult to find *pornographic* images
plans only in effect in @entity14 but *due* to be introduced internationally
company refuses to say , however , when restrictions will be introduced in @entity35
internet users accuse the company of ' censorship '
