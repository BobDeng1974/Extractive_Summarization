behind the badge : @entity1 worked as a @entity3 agent from 2007 to 2013 and is now a writer a former @entity3 officer has confirmed many of the worst suspicions about airport security screeners : they stop passengers for having an attitude , they confiscate snow globes from children and nail clippers from pilots , they profile passengers based on their nationality			1
and yes , they do see travelers naked in the x-ray photos			0
in a confessional piece for @entity23 , former @entity3 agent - turned - writer @entity1 spills the secrets on the ways that the security workers pass the time during their long shifts			1
‘ i confiscated jars of homemade apple butter on the pretense that they could pose threats to national security			0
i was even required to confiscate nail clippers from airline pilots — the implied logic being that pilots could use the nail clippers to hijack the very planes they were flying , ’ he wrote			0
one of the most coveted rotations while he worked at @entity44 ’s @entity43 airport while @entity1 worked there from 2007 through 2013 was the secretive @entity46 room where guards took turns sitting in the windowless room - that also lacked security cameras - viewing the pictures of passengers that the x-ray machines took			1
‘ many of the images we gawked at were of overweight people , their every fold and dimple on full awful display			0
piercings of every kind were visible			0
women who ’d had mastectomies were easy to discern — their chests showed up on our screens as dull , pixelated regions			0
@entity64 appeared as bulging , blistery growths in the crotch area , ’ he wrote in the @entity23 article			0
‘ all the old , crass stereotypes about race and genitalia size thrived on our secure government radio channels			0
’ the @entity46 room turned into its own experiment in explicit behavior as agents would use it as a secret meeting point for mid0 - work rendez - vous since the lack of security cameras kept them from being busted			1
the @entity3 issued a statement in response to @entity86 , saying : ' many of the @entity3 procedures and policies referenced in this article are no longer in place or are characterized inaccurately			2
' too close for comfort : @entity3 agents laughed at passengers , including every ' fold and dimple ' that was noted by the scanners when an overweight passenger walked through the $ 150,000 machines extra bonus : passengers may not enjoy their last minute purchases , but the @entity3 agents sure do explicit : he said that the agents were judgmental and observed ' crass ' racial and gender stereotypes ' every passenger deserves to be treated with dignity and respect and @entity3 policy upholds this standard			1
@entity3 does not tolerate any form of unethical or unlawful behavior by its employees and takes swift disciplinary action if discovered			2
' since november 2011 , @entity3 has aggressively implemented risk - based security procedures to move away from a ‘ one - size - fits - all ’ approach			1
' @entity3 has installed @entity118 software on every @entity119 ( @entity119 ) unit in use , eliminating the analyzed images referenced in the article			2
it concluded by reporting that the agency ' has instituted one - step removal procedures in many cases for employees behaving unethically or unlawfully '			0
@entity1 , who went on to take a graduate course in creative writing after leaving the @entity3 , even translated the underhanded code - words used by the agents to alert their friends to an attractive passenger approaching the line			1
@entity135 and @entity136 are both used to give a heads - up about an attractive woman headed towards the agents			2
@entity139 and @entity140 are also used in the same way - depending on the color of her shirt			0
while the overly - detailed pictures provided entertainment for the screeners , @entity1 writes that the expensive machines did little else			1
even when a representative from the machine manufacturer came to give the @entity3 agents a tutorial on the $ 150,000 machines , he admitted that they barely worked			1
waste : @entity1 tells how anything can get past the x-ray machines and agents regularly got back at annoying passengers by having them go through extra checks ‘ he said we would n’t be able to distinguish plastic explosives from body fat and that guns were practically invisible if they were turned sideways in a pocket , ’ @entity1 wrote			1
a number of agents became concerned about the amount of secondary radiation they were being put through by working next to the machines day - in and day - out , even though they regularly towed the party line that it was safe when passengers asked them the same question			1
while he expressed empathy for alarmed pregnant women who were told to go through the machine anyway , there were also lighter moments that came as a result			0
one of his code words listed on the blog that he started to vent about life behind the @entity3 shield , called taking sense away , was the ‘ baby - shower - opt - out ’ : when a woman opts out and explains that she is pregnant to the surprise of the friends she is traveling with , who shriek and yell and have an impromptu celebration			2
the more serious allegations that came through in his piece came to his description of the not - so - random security checks of ‘ suspicious ’ passengers			1
a number of boarding passes have a code - @entity201 - printed on them based on the passenger ’s name , indicating that they are on a watch list or have been flagged up for whatever reason			2
beyond that , a passenger ’s nationality could also automatically prove reason for an extra-thorough check and each @entity3 agent is given a list of a dozen countries that they should memorize ( or pin to the back of their shield badge for safe keeping ) : @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230			1
all a farce ? agents regularly make fun of their colleagues who ' thought their job was a matter of national security ' , and called them ' white shirts ' in return conspicuously absent from that list ? @entity242 and @entity243 , two countries with a history of harboring terrorists			2
@entity1 explained that the slip was not accidental but political			0
political posturing and possible security threats were not the only reasons that you could be selected for an extra search , however , as he also explained that ‘ retaliatory wait time ’ was a common practice , as agents regularly made the process more difficult when they simply did n’t like your attitude			1
‘ pretending that something in your bag or on your full body image needs to be resolved - the punitive possibilities are endless , and there are many tricks in the screener ’s bag , ’ he wrote			0
@entity1 began voicing his concerns about @entity3 practices well into his time there , first writing a letter that was published in the @entity272 in 2010			1
his supervisor had ‘ a chat ’ with him about it , but did n’t fire him , and so he continued to write about his complaints but this time on an anonymous blog			0
that blog , taking sense away , eventually went viral and his fear of being caught and desire to leave a job that he never intended to be long - term led to his decision to leave and go to graduate school in 2013			0
he is now working on a book about his time in uniform .			0
