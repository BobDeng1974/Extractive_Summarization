studies have shown that people from @entity2 are officially the happiest people on @entity3 , and now scientists think they know why			1
according to research from the @entity7 , genetics could be the key to explaining a nation ’s levels of happiness			1
researchers who looked at survey data from 131 countries found that the closer a nation was genetically to the @entity2 , the happier its people were			1
@entity7 researchers have investigated why @entity2 are so happy ( stock image shown )			1
the country regularly tops polls of the world 's happiest people			1
they found there was a correlation between @entity28 genes and happiness , while people with @entity28 ancestry were also happier economists at the @entity33 in the @entity34 ( @entity35 ) looked at why certain countries top the world happiness rankings			1
last year 's @entity38 from the @entity39 ranked @entity2 the happiest nation on @entity3 , with an average life satisfaction score of 7.69 out of 10			1
it was followed by four other northern @entity44 countries , @entity45 , the @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			0
the @entity49 was ranked 22nd on the list of 156 countries , with a score of 6.88			2
the world 's most miserable country was said to be @entity55 , @entity56 , which managed only 2.93 on the satisfaction scale			1
other @entity59 countries also dominated the bottom of the @entity61 has also topped the @entity63 's " eurobarometer " table of citizen well - being and happiness every year since 1973			1
the research , published by the @entity69 economic research institute @entity68 in its @entity71 series , could help to solve the puzzle of why a country like @entity2 so regularly tops the world happiness rankings			1
@entity28 birth was also associated with specific versions of a gene that influences brain levels of the mood chemical serotonin			2
compared with people from other countries , @entity2 were less likely to possess a short version of the gene linked to low levels of life satisfaction			1
‘ the results were surprising , ’ said economist dr @entity86 from @entity35			0
‘ we found that the greater a nation 's genetic distance from @entity2 , the lower the reported wellbeing of that nation			1
‘ our research adjusts for many other influences including @entity95 , culture , religion and the strength of the welfare state and geography			0
’ the researchers used data on 131 countries from a number of international surveys including the @entity105 , @entity106 and the @entity107			0
the researchers linked cross-national data on genetic distance and well - being			0
whether money can buy happiness or not ( stock image shown ) is cause for debate , but it seems one sure - fire way to ensure your well - being is simply to have @entity28 dna			2
the new research was published by the @entity69 economic research institute @entity68 in its @entity71 series the second form of evidence looked at existing research suggesting an association between mental wellbeing and a mutation of the gene that influences the re-uptake of serotonin , which is believed to be linked to human mood			0
serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps to relay nerve signals			0
‘ we looked at existing research which suggested that the long and short variants of this gene are correlated with different probabilities of clinical depression , although this link is still highly debated , ’ dr @entity86 continued			0
‘ the short version has been associated with higher scores on neuroticism and lower life satisfaction			0
‘ intriguingly , among the 30 nations included in the study , it is @entity2 and the @entity46 that appear to have the lowest percentage of people with this short version			2
’ a deficiency of the chemical in the brain is strongly linked to depression while levels are boosted by the drug ecstasy			0
compared with people from other countries , @entity2 were less likely to possess a short version of the gene linked to low levels of life satisfaction			1
' the results were surprising , ' said economist dr @entity86 from @entity35			0

co-author professor @entity180 , also from the @entity7 , said : ‘ we used data on the reported well - being of @entity183 and then looked at which part of the world their ancestors had come from			2
‘ the evidence revealed that there is an unexplained positive correlation between the happiness today of some nations and the observed happiness of @entity183 whose ancestors came from these nations , even after controlling for personal income and religion			2
‘ this study has used three kinds of evidence and , contrary to our own assumptions when we began the project , it seems there are reasons to believe that genetic patterns may help researchers to understand international well - being levels			0
‘ more research in this area is now needed and economists and social scientists may need to pay greater heed to the role of genetic variation across national populations			0

@entity7 researchers investigated why @entity2 are so happy
the country regularly tops polls of the world 's happiest people
they found there was a correlation between @entity28 genes and happiness
and they also discovered people with @entity28 ancestry were more likely to have a positive *outlook* on life
last year 's @entity38 ranked @entity2 as the happiest nation on @entity3
