@entity1 chairman @entity0 will open himself up to accusations of cronyism in his appointment of a new general secretary to replace @entity6 if he does not employ headhunters			1
an @entity1 board meeting this week discussed whether they could save money by selecting @entity6 ’s successor through their own contacts rather than hire expensive recruitment specialists			1
a decision has yet to be made but the saving of £ 100,000 - plus has to be measured against the need for such a scrutinised body as the @entity1 having a transparent open process in finding their next lead executive			1
the @entity1 have used headhunters to fill all their senior positions over the last few years — including @entity0 ’s own appointment			1
and @entity6 leaving has given the @entity1 an unexpected opportunity to analyse the type of ceo they want — best served through a rigorous independent search			1
@entity6 will leave his position as the @entity1 's general secretary after 11 years in january @entity31 ( left ) offered the much - maligned @entity32 the chance to have dinner with him even @entity35 find it difficult sorting out fact from the fiction in the constant stories surrounding @entity40 keeping the hunt in - house could lead to significant problems if it emerges that the choice had strong links with @entity0 or any of the other @entity1 power brokers making the selection			1
at least the discarded @entity32 still has one friend from his @entity50 days			1
@entity31 , well enough after his stress - related illness to go on the @entity54 tour , offered the chance to have dinner with him and @entity32 to the @entity58 charity auction			1
it was bought for over £ 10,000 by @entity61 ’s class of 92			2
meanwhile , @entity63 ’s autobiography is proving to have sustained buying interest rather more than @entity32 ’s book after they were both published in a blaze of publicity			1
@entity63 ’s sales last week in the @entity70 and @entity71 were 20,000 hardbacks compared to @entity32 ’s 5,700			2

the owner of rundown @entity74 next door to @entity76 deep in the @entity78 countryside wrote to the @entity1 looking for funding to help refurbish the facilities			2
the @entity1 were not interested in supporting @entity81 despite fast air transport to @entity83 being one sure - fire way of making the £ 100million park more popular with the @entity50 team who still use @entity87 outside @entity88 as their other base during international weeks because of its proximity to @entity91			2

even @entity35 find it difficult sorting out fact from the fiction in the constant stories surrounding their striker @entity40			2
the latest gem doing the rounds is that @entity40 and friends were refused entry into a nightclub in @entity102 because some were wearing trainers			0
so they went back to a late - night bar in @entity107 where @entity40 lives and he treated everyone in the hostelry to drinks for making him welcome			0

tickets prove a point in a week when @entity114 ’s idiot vice president @entity113 said that ‘ a woman ’s place was in the kitchen and not on the football field ’ , the best news for women ’s football is the expected crowd at @entity91 for the @entity50 v @entity124 women ’s international on november 23			0
the @entity1 were originally hoping for around 30,000 to be there			2
but already more than 41,000 tickets have been sold for what will be the biggest attendance ever for a women ’s football match in the @entity70 outside the @entity131			0
@entity113 should be forced to watch as part of his four - month ban			0

@entity134 starting their ‘ whole new revamped ’ @entity136 coverage next friday night with @entity138 v @entity137 presented by stand - in @entity140 has n’t impressed former rights holders @entity142			0
and @entity142 are underwhelmed that the @entity134 are incorporating @entity144 reaction , with all its dangers on live tv , into their interactive final score programme on the sunday			0
@entity134 counter that their first - round offerings will be a significant ‘ step up ’ from last year ’s coverage			0
@entity140 will kick - off the @entity134 's coverage of the @entity136 at @entity138 next friday night @entity154 ’s torturous route to finding a site for the stadium in @entity157 for his @entity159 franchise is expected to become clearer by the new year , with other investors coming on board			1
however , the problems of finding a permanent site in @entity157 are such that the @entity154 camp are considering a stadium share with the @entity166 or @entity167			1
@entity170 ’s @entity169 @entity159 side , who enter the league next year , have not yet sorted out a stadium location and will be playing at the @entity174			0
@entity154 's route to finding a @entity157 stadium site for his @entity159 franchise will become clear in the new year			1

the @entity1 discussed whether to employ headhunters in finding general secretary @entity6 's successor
@entity154 wants to find a permanent site in @entity157
@entity32 was offered the chance to go to dinner with @entity31
