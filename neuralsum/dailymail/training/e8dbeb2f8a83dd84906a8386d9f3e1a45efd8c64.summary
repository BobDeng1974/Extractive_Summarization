@entity0 is ready to boost @entity2 ’s firepower by returning from injury against @entity4 at @entity5 on saturday			1
the @entity8 striker ’s fitness has been in question since he joined @entity2 on loan from @entity11 in the summer and he has not played for five weeks because of a calf injury			1
but manager @entity13 revealed that @entity0 is set to return to the squad this weekend , and @entity15 may also be included after recovering from the dislocated shoulder he suffered in the @entity18 derby at the start of this month			1
‘ i live day by day at this moment			2
it ’s always difficult to say but we have good news			2
maybe @entity0 and @entity15 come back in the 18 , that ’s it i think			1
the rest were already fit			2
’ @entity0 , who will cost in excess of £ 50million if @entity2 sign him permanently in the summer , has made only five appearances so far and scored once			1
asked if he believes the former @entity50 and @entity51 striker can rediscover the form that made him one of the most feared strikers in world football , @entity39 added : ‘ i hope so because we have him on loan because of that			1
‘ every player in my selection has to fight for his position			0
i shall always take the best of the players and it has to be suitable for the mix of players			0
it ’s also an obligation of a player that he does that			0
’ @entity69 led the line as the @entity2 squad took part in sprint drills on friday @entity0 ( right ) has had a stuttering start to his @entity2 career , but is back for the weekend @entity76 ( centre ) takes part in a drill with his @entity2 team - mates at @entity34 @entity39 is confident @entity0 will rediscover his best form when his injury problems clear up @entity82 is set to miss between four and six weeks with ankle ligament damage sustained against @entity84 @entity2 sit fourth in the @entity86 table ahead of the weekend 's match @entity2 still have a worrying injury list with @entity82 the latest to be ruled out for between four and six weeks with the ankle ligament damage he suffered against @entity84 last weekend			1
@entity39 also confirmed that he has given @entity90 a holiday after the midfielder suffered a knee injury playing for @entity94 earlier this month			1
the @entity2 boss said : ‘ @entity82 sustained an ankle ligament injury but with no serious complications			1
he will be out for the next few weeks because of this			2
‘ i gave @entity90 a holiday because in the first week it is more or less rest than exercise			0
he did n’t have so much holiday because of the @entity104			0
you may remember the @entity94 were there until the end			0
‘ he will come back on monday			0
then he has to exercise and practise every day because an injured player has to train more than a fit player			0
’ @entity90 , who injured his knee on international duty , will report back to @entity2 on monday @entity39 was guarded in his optimism that @entity2 will end the season in the @entity114 places @entity2 ’s victory at the @entity116 lifted them into fourth place but @entity39 was guarded in his optimism at seeing his team among the @entity114 spots despite the injury problems and a fixture list that has seen them face @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity84 in three of the last four games			1
‘ i do n’t want to mention that ( injuries ) as a manager because i want to speak about the fit players , but you ’re right when you see how our preparation was , how many injuries , and then how heavy our second part of the matches were , ’ he added			0
‘ it was a very big test but after ( playing ) heavy opponents we are still a force so i ’m happy			0
but we have to be a force at the end of the league , not now			0
now is not so important			0
we have to improve our playing style and beat our opponents more easily			2
’ former @entity2 skipper @entity145 returns to @entity5 with @entity4 on saturday to take charge of his 700th @entity86 game as a manager			1
at the age of 63 , @entity39 knows he is unlikely to reach the same milestone			1
‘ it says that he is a very good manager i think , but i do n’t know , i can not judge him , ’ he said			0
‘ when you have 700 @entity86 matches , i do n’t think i will reach that amount			1
‘ i have seen him playing for @entity2			2
he was a very firm and also a leader			0
mostly players who are leaders become managers			0
’ @entity160 here to like our @entity2 facebook page			2
