she 's the bubbly pageant queen with a penchant for glamorous dresses so it made sense for @entity6 fashion to snap up @entity7 to model its new partywear collection			1
the model and tv star has replaced @entity12 as the face of the brand and showcases the glamorous , girly styles to perfection in the new campaign			1
speaking about her new campaign , @entity7 told @entity19 : ' i am so excited to be modelling this range , it is princess - like , sparkly and girly so i was in my element			1
i come from pageantry and full - on glamorous attire is what i love to wear so the opportunity to wear all these beautiful dresses was one i could n't turn down			1
' the new range is full of party dresses ideal for the season ahead and @entity7 says each and every design makes her feel confident , which , she says , is the most important element of getting ready for a big event			1
beauty buff : @entity7 says it does n't take her very long to get ready , despite what people may think , and she 's really interested in organic beauty and natural remedies ( £ 95 ) in her element : @entity7 said she loved modelling the new range because she is a huge fan of girly , feminine fashion ( £ 160 ) party perfect : the new range , which @entity7 launched yesterday at @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 , is full of party dresses ideal for the season ahead and @entity7 says each and every design makes her feel confident ( £ 95 ) what 's her secret ? @entity7 eats a clean and lean diet - she loves protein - rich meals - and works out every other day to stay in shape ( £ 160 ) ' people do n't believe me but i get ready very quickly			1
i try to enhance myself , not change myself			0
it 's important to highlight the best of what you 've got , ' she said about her beautifying regime			0
@entity7 , who describes her personal style as ' girly girl ' , says another misconception people have is that they think she dresses like a grandmother			1
' they say i dress like an old lady but it 's because i love the fifties			0
everyone is so into looking cool and wearing leather and then i 'm there prancing around in my dress			0
' when it comes to style inspiration , the 22 - year - old cites her style icons as @entity89 and @entity90 ; she takes the classic @entity92 look of @entity90 and combines it with the strong , independent flair of @entity89			2
she 's a pro ! @entity7 recently landed a modelling contract and proves her worth as professional poser modelling the new dresses from the @entity98 collection ( left : £ 65 , right : £ 175 ) despite getting a taste for the world of fashion in this new campaign , @entity7 admits she does n't have the expertise needed to create her own range			1
' i know everyone does their own collection but i need to get a taste of it before i would ever consider it			0
i do n't follow trends so i 'd suck at designing ! , ' she said			2
one project she is considering - and one that she knows all about - is beauty			2
' i would love to look into designing my own hair range or natural organic make - up collection			1
i am a big believer in finding alternative treatments			0
' i make my own hair treatments but i ca n't give you the secret formula in case i develop it ! '			2
maybe one day : despite getting a taste for the world of fashion in this new campaign , @entity7 admits she does n't have the expertise needed to create her own range and would rather venture into beauty ( £ 120 ) beauty guru : @entity7 says the secret behind her glossy hair is a homemade mixture - but she wo n't share it in case she wants to one day develop it ( left : £ 95 ) as well as sticking to an organic beauty regime , @entity7 swears by a clean and lean diet			1
' if i want to feel good , i eat raw , natural food			2
if mother nature did n't make it , do n't eat it , ' she says			0
however , the lithe - limbed star does allow herself the occasional treat and says she 's very flexible when it comes to eating			0
' i do n't let my diet control me , i would never let it rule my life and i love a good pizza			1
i know from first - hand experience from when i was in the jungle on @entity149 that not eating properly is really bad for your body			0
i lost a lot of weight but then just piled it all back on afterwards			0
' the star , who just landed herself a modelling contract with a top agency , says that she exercises every other day and really enjoys it but found the @entity55 marathon ' horrific '			0
fresh from her latest fashion campaign , @entity7 has lots of plans in the pipeline but says they 're all ' top secret '			2
the @entity167 is now available from www.celebrityfashionclothing.co.uk			0

@entity7 , 22 , is new face of @entity27

works out every other day and eats clean and lean
says she treats herself to pizza occasionally and does n't let diet rule her
may consider developing a natural beauty range
