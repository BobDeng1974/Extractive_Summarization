the medical insurer offers financial incentives to those who agree to have heart , cancer or gynaecological surgery in @entity16 hospitals			0
one campaigner said @entity5 was ‘ dumping ’ these patients on the @entity7 because the procedures they need are the most expensive – meaning the company can save money and accumulate higher profits			1
the firm denied this , saying the money given out in the ‘ @entity7 cash benefit ’ offer was simply a rebate because the patients were not accessing the private care their health insurance policies could provide			1
but @entity32 said the company was simply putting increased pressure on the @entity16 , which was already overburdened			0

’ @entity49 , of pressure group @entity50 , said private healthcare firms were ‘ milking the @entity7 ’			2
‘ the operations they are offering to pay people to have on the @entity7 are the ones they are least equipped to deal with … @entity5 has realised these operations are the most expensive and are now dumping these patients on the @entity7 , ’ he said			1

dr @entity74 , a gp in south - east @entity76 , said : ‘ the @entity7 is effectively subsidising the private sector because these private health insurers can charge a smaller premium in the knowledge the @entity7 is there to deal with anything complex and costly			1
