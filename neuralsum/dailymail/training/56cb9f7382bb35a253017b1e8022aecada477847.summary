rethink : @entity0 called for a rethink on religious and gay rights six months after she condemned a @entity4 couple for turning away gay guests from their hotel a judge who condemned a @entity4 couple for turning away gay guests from their hotel yesterday said her decision may have been wrong			1
@entity10 deputy president @entity0 called for a rethink on religious and gay rights six months after she rejected the @entity13 owners ’ arguments in a key test case			1
@entity0 said in a speech that the law has done too little to protect the beliefs of @entity4			2
and she cast doubts over her own judgment in the landmark case in which a gay couple sued @entity4 hoteliers @entity24 and @entity25			1
mr @entity26 , 74 , and his 70 - year - old wife refused a double room at their @entity30 hotel to @entity32 and @entity33 in 2008 because they were not a married heterosexual couple			1
the incident led to a string of court cases , which culminated in defeat for the @entity40 at the @entity10 – where @entity0 , leading four other judges , ruled that the rights of the gay couple outweighed the conscience of the @entity4 couple			1
@entity0 declared in her @entity10 ruling that we should be ‘ slow to accept ’ the right of @entity4 to discriminate against gay people			2
but in march she acknowledged that the laws which ignore @entity4 consciences might not be ‘ sustainable ’			0
last week , in a highly unusual move , @entity0 and her fellow judges ordered that the @entity40 will not be liable for legal costs – a decision which spares them a huge bill which would pay for the lawyers who represented mr @entity32 and mr @entity33			1
and in a speech to @entity59 lawyers yesterday she gave an indication that her judgment against the @entity40 may have been too harsh , asking whether courts would be better off taking a ‘ more nuanced approach ’			1
@entity0 suggested that the law should develop a ‘ conscience clause ’ for @entity4 like the @entity40			2
court case : @entity32 and @entity33 were refused a double room at @entity68 in @entity69 christian beliefs : @entity24 and @entity25 were told last week that they will not be liable for legal costs she said : ‘ i am not sure our law has found a reasonable accommodation of all these different strands ’ , adding : ‘ an example of treatment which @entity4 may feel to be unfair is the recent case of @entity81			1
should we be developing an explicit requirement upon providers of employment , goods and services to make reasonable accommodation for the manifestation of religious beliefs ? ’ last year the @entity40 were on the point of selling their hotel , @entity68 in @entity69			2
however they said they have managed to stay in business thanks to help from supporters			0
mrs @entity40 said : ‘ the pendulum has swung too far one way			0
‘ why ca n’t two lifestyles live together ? it is too late for us , but we are glad the issue has n’t gone away			0
it is being debated so there may be an opportunity for more balance to be brought into this			0
’ and @entity104 , from the @entity105 , said : ‘ the penny is beginning to drop among judges that the law is unfair			0
i hope the @entity10 will find more room to protect @entity4 consciences			0
’ staying put : last year the @entity40 were on the point of selling their hotel , @entity68 in @entity69			0
however they said they have managed to stay in business thanks to help from supporters			0
