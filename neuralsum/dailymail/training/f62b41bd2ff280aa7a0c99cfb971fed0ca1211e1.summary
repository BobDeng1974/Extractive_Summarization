by @entity0 a doctor who was the the first to climb the highest mountains on every continent has survived a brain hemorrhage because of his hobby			1
dr @entity6 is only alive because his body had become used to being starved of oxygen at heights of up to 30,000ft			1
being at such high altitudes had forced open an artery that normally closes down at birth			1
had it not been open , he would have died			1
dr @entity6 is only alive today because his body had become used to being starved of oxygen at heights of up to 30,000ft dr @entity6 at the summit of @entity18 - the highest mountain in @entity20			1
being at such high altitudes had forced open an artery that normally closes down at birth			1
had it not been open , he would have died after successfully summiting the seven highest mountains of the world , he was suddenly struck by the subarachnoid brain haemorrhage , and his family was told he would not survive			1
but despite going into a coma as his body began to shut down , dr @entity6 saved his own life in an extraordinary twist of fate			1
the 49 - year - old said : ' i suddenly felt an odd fast - creeping spasm over my lower neck			2
' the neck pain moved swiftly to head pain and i began to fear i was having a brain haemorrhage			2
' my vision was affected , most things appeared hazy , and i thought i was going to die			2
' dr @entity6 ’s interest in mountain climbing began aged 11 , when he met @entity42 - the first @entity43 person to successfully summit @entity45			1
dr @entity6 on the @entity46 on @entity45 - the most dangerous part of the climb			1
after successfully summiting the seven highest mountains of the world , he was suddenly struck by the subarachnoid brain haemorrhage , and his family was told he would not survive within seven years , he made it to the top of @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity18 , @entity56 , @entity45 , @entity57 , @entity58 and the @entity59 , before facing his hardest climb to date - fighting for survival			1
' from the minute i met @entity42 i was hooked , ' he said			2
' it made me want to know what it felt like to stand on top of the world and how people can get so high without being in a plane			2
' i thought to myself , one day i want to answer those questions			0
' i climbed @entity54 in @entity71 in 2002 and went on to climb the highest mountains in the world over the next five years			1
' dr @entity6 with his wife @entity74			1
he said : ' i suddenly felt an odd fast - creeping spasm over my lower neck ' during his explorations around the world , dr @entity6 , from @entity77 , @entity78 , endured sub-zero temperatures , watched climbers fall to their death coming and was even held at gunpoint			1
he said : ' it was now or never for @entity45 , but we picked the worst year for fatalities			0
seventeen people died , and three of those were on a trek an hour ahead of us			2
' it was actually the morning that we left an hour late or we would have been caught up with them			0
' on another climb , we were taken hostage for 13 hours on a bus floor as raiders tried to extract as much money from us as possible			0

dr @entity6 's interest in mountain climbing began aged 11 , when he met @entity42 - the first @entity43 person to successfully summit @entity45 ' they would have shot us if we had tried to move , but we did what they said until they let us go			1
' but his toughest challenge was yet to come , and it was thanks to his gruelling crusades to date that saved him from death			0
' i had a brain haemorrhage which should have killed me , but a blood vessel opened which ultimately saved my life , ' said dr. @entity6			1
' had it not been open , it would have just burst			2
most people would have died within 20 minutes , but my brain had become used to coping with as little as 40 per cent oxygen			2
“ my brain had been stressed and the blood vessel reopened			0
rather than the brain being cut off , it was directed to the areas that needed the blood and most of the functions regained			0
he said : ' if i had not been climbing , my brain would not have developed an extra vessel , so i would have died ' ' altitude does odd things to the body			2
oxygen deprivation occurs noticeably above six thousand feet , producing an aching in the muscle tissues and a streaming cold similar to a mild influenza			2
“ exercising and breathing feels constrained , as if you have a plastic bag over your head , but in the long run these are the things that saved my life			0
' if i had not been climbing , my brain would not have developed an extra vessel so i would have died			2
' with a medical background , dr @entity6 realised he was having a brain hamorrhage and called his surgeon wife @entity147 , 41			1
after arriving at hospital , he called his parents to say goodbye before drifting into a coma			0
earlier this year awarded the @entity151 by the @entity152 for his bravery and skill dr @entity6 said : ' i could hear the consultant and i could hear what was going on around me - they were telling my family i was going to die and discussing organ donation with @entity147			1
' they found out it was a tumour which usually ends in death , and when i awoke from the coma i lost my sight , which they said was likely never to return			0
' luckily after about six hours it did , but as i was recovering i was so worried about losing my memory and forgetting about my amazing experiences so i decided to write them down			0
' dr @entity6 has since written a book about his mountain climbing and the medical miracle that saved his life - titled @entity173			1
dr @entity6 ( pictured right at at the summit of the @entity59 , @entity176 ) said : ' i have no idea how i got my medal , but i am incredibly honoured			1
someone must have nominated me ' and , earlier this year awarded the @entity151 by the @entity152 for his bravery and skill			0
he said : ' i have no idea how i got my medal , but i am incredibly honoured			0
someone must have nominated me			0
' it ’s the medal that ’s awarded to people that have done the stuff themselves			0
it ’s a really nice one to have			0
' i ’ve been through some really amazing life changing events and it ’s been great being part of these climbs			0
' there ’s not a day that goes by that i do n’t think i ’m incredibly fortunate			0
i live with that in the knowledge that i ’m still here			0
' the reason i ’m still alive is because i know when to stop			0

dr @entity6 , 49 , has climbed the highest mountains in every continent
as a result , his body had become used to being starved of oxygen
high altitudes had also forced open an artery that usually closes at birth
had the artery been closed , he would have died
