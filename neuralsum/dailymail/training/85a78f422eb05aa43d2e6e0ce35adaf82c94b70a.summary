three men have been arrested by the @entity2 army for apparently trying to cut through an undersea internet cable			1
a patrol stopped a fishing boat near the @entity7 port city of @entity8 and arrested three divers , an army spokesman said on his official @entity12 page			1
it is believed they were trying to cut through an sea - me - we 4 undersea cable - one of the main connections between @entity17 and @entity18 , running from @entity19 to @entity20 and linking @entity21 , north @entity22 , the middle east and south @entity17			1
if the men had been successful , experts warned they could have taken an ' entire continent offline ' , but interruptions were reported around the region , including @entity28 and @entity29 , today			1
a picture of the three men who are believed to have been arrested in connection with the incident , which the @entity2 army has posted on @entity12 the cable targeted , the @entity33 , is 18,800 kilometres long , and is the primary internet ' backbone ' between south - east @entity17 , the @entity29 subcontinent , the @entity37 and @entity18			1
it has 17 landing points , pictured above , which are the areas where the cable comes ashore the men were reportedly just 750metres off the shore of @entity8 when they were caught			1
no indication of who the men were or what their motive for cutting the cable was			1
it is also unclear how much damage was done			0
but @entity52 reported that there was evidence of slow internet connections as far away as @entity56 and @entity29 , according to a network security firm which studies web traffic			0
the cable is owned by @entity60 , the biggest web provider in the north @entity22 country and slow services were expected to be improved by the end of today			1
operator seacom said in the hours that followed the men 's arrest that it was confident that full service would be restored quickly			2
it added in a statement earlier today : ' we understand from our @entity2 colleagues that the investigation is in its early stages and nothing is as yet confirmed with regard to the cause of the damage to @entity80 - 4 '			1
the company said that it did not believe that recent damage caused to another cable was caused by sabotage due to its location			2
under the sea lies a multi-billion - dollar network of high - power cables through which 99 per cent of global internet traffic travels			0
submarine cables are expensive to build ( generally ranging from $ 100m - $ 500m ) but they deliver a huge amount of capacity			0
most of the new cables can deliver several terabits ( terabit = 1,000 gigabit ) of capacity			0
each cable costs about $ 10m a year in maintenance costs -- the price operators have to pay to keep repair ships on standby , and other costs			2
the cables themselves are often not much wider than garden hoses and contain fibre - optic lines which can each contain bandwidth for up to 20 million people			0
one cable between the @entity111 and the @entity112 carries 3.2 terabits of data per second - the 7,600 mile journey takes 0.00072 seconds			2
data on newer , hi - tech internet cables is ' flashed ' down the lines by high - powered lasers , and the intensity is maintained by electrical repeaters costing up to £ 1 million each			0
an electrical cable runs parallel to the fibre - optic line to power the repeaters			2
one cable failure - between @entity125 and @entity2 - left more than 50 per cent of @entity29 without power in 2008 , sending the country 's computer industry and stock markets offline for hours			1
@entity130 , chief technology officer of @entity111 - based @entity131 , said a cut cable can cause data to become congested and flow the long way around the world			2
the same @entity33 was seriously damaged back in 2008 by a ship 's anchor			0
then , @entity2 web traffic was cut by around 75 per cent until the cable was repaired			1
news of the men 's arrest comes after a bitter feud between two online companies - a group which aims to block unwanted emails known as ‘ spam ’ and a firm accused of sending them - has already been blamed for days of disruption for internet users , in the biggest cyber-attack ever launched			1
spam - fighting organisation @entity153 said it has been subjected to a massive cyber-attack , apparently from @entity158 company @entity157 which it black - listed earlier this month			0
at its peak , @entity157 clogged up 300 gigabits per second of the @entity163 , it has been reported			0
but if the men had been successful in their undersea sabotage attempt , it would have effectively switched off 1.28 terabits — four times as much bandwidth — and with nothing more high - tech than an axe , @entity172 claims			1
it said : ' most big countries have several redundant cables landing on their shores			0
' but the loss of even a single one means that all the traffic must be jammed through remaining connections , causing congestion			0
' and there is nothing to stop determined attackers from targeting several cables			0
indeed , since many cables go through geographic chokepoints like the @entity190 , it would n’t be difficult to disrupt a whole bunch of connections in a brief period of time			0
' in the past week there have been several reports of severed cables off the coast of @entity2 that are part of @entity200 , a network of cables serving much of @entity22			1
@entity203 , of @entity29 , reports many using @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 and state - run @entity207 ( @entity207 ) had witnessed disruption or a slower speed during the past few days as a result of the recent fibre optic cable breaks off the @entity213 coast , close to @entity8			2
it reports the fibre optics which were cut include @entity216 ( @entity216 ) , @entity217 ( ten ) , @entity17 – @entity37 – @entity18 4 ( @entity218 ) , @entity29 - @entity37 - @entity18 ( @entity219 )			0
it had been thought that ships had accidentally caught the cables , but there are now concerns there could be a concerted effort to take down @entity2 ’s connectivity , although it has not been confirmed whether the incidents are connected			1

web users have reported slower connections across @entity2 since then			2
the firm , which carries traffic for other companies , said yesterday that services had been restored only to report hours later another connection had been cut			0

three men arrested by the @entity2 army for ' cutting undersea cable '
if the *bid* was successful it could have taken an ' entire continent offline '
it comes after one of the biggest cyber-attacks ever launched
