environmentalists have hit out at a giant new solar farm in the @entity2 as mounting evidence reveals birds flying through the extremely hot ' thermal flux ' surrounding the towers are being scorched			1
after years of regulatory tangles around the impact on desert wildlife , the @entity7 opened on thursday but environmental groups say the nearly 350,000 gigantic mirrors are generating 1000 degree @entity14 temperatures which are killing and singeing birds			1
according to compliance documents released by developer @entity18 last year , dozens of birds were found injured at the site during the building stage			0
state and federal regulators are currently conducting a two - year study of the @entity7 plant 's effects on birds , with environmental groups questioning the the value of cleaner power when native wildlife is being killed or injured			1
larger projects are on the way , but for now , @entity7 is being described as a marker for the @entity88 ' emerging solar industry			1
while solar power accounts for less than one per cent of the nation 's power output , thousands of projects from large , utility - scale plants to small production sites are under construction or being planned , particularly across the sun - drenched @entity96			1
' the opening of @entity7 is a dawn of a new era in power generation in the @entity88 , ' said @entity102 , president of the @entity103 , a trade group			1
' we are going to be a global leader in solar generation			0
' the plant 's dedication comes as government continues to push for development of greener , cleaner power			2
president @entity112 has mounted a second - term drive to combat climate change , proposing first - ever limits on carbon pollution from new and existing power plants			2
his plan aims to help move the @entity88 from a coal - dependent past into a future fired by wind and solar power , nuclear energy and natural gas			2
according to @entity130 data , the cost of building and operating a new solar thermal power plant over its lifetime is greater than generating natural gas , coal or nuclear power			1
it costs a conventional coal plant $ 100 , on average , to produce a megawatt - hour of power , but that figure is $ 261 for solar thermal power , according to 2011 estimates			1
the figures do not account for incentives such as state or federal tax credits that can impact the cost			0
@entity146 , a spokesman for the solar association , said in a statement that solar systems have seen ' dramatic price declines ' in the last few years			0
that 's good for utilities in @entity75 , which must obtain a third of their electricity from solar and other renewable sources by 2020			1
supervising power : @entity56 , left , talks with @entity158 as they look out over a part of the five - square - mile field of gigantic mirrors set to produce enough electricity to power 140,000 homes shining beacon : while solar power accounts for less than one per cent of the nation 's power output , thousands of projects from large , utility - scale plants to small production sites are under construction or being planned , particularly across the sun - drenched @entity96 nice view : one of the three boiler towers with uses the reflections from the mirrors to heat water and create steam which powers the turbines to create electricity the @entity7 site , about 45 miles southwest of @entity184 , has virtually unbroken sunshine most of the year and is near transmission lines that carry power to consumers			1
using technology known as solar - thermal , more than 300,000 computer - controlled mirrors roughly the size of a garage door reflect sunlight to boilers atop 459 - foot towers			1
the sun 's power is used to heat water in the boilers ' tubes and make steam , which drives turbines to create electricity			2
while many people are familiar with rooftop solar , or photovoltaic panels , ' these are a little bit different			0
this takes the sun 's rays and reflects them onto towers , ' said @entity80 spokesman @entity56			2
the plant can be a startling sight for drivers heading toward @entity184 along busy @entity216			0
amid miles of rock and scrub , its vast array of 7 - by - 10 - foot mirrors creates the image of an ethereal lake shimmering atop the desert floor			2
in fact , it 's built on a dry lakebed			0
@entity81 announced in 2011 that it would invest $ 168million in the project			0
as part of its financing , @entity18 also lined up $ 1.6billion in loans guaranteed by the @entity232			0
@entity7 can be seen as a success story and a cautionary tale , highlighting the inevitable trade - offs between the need for cleaner power and the loss of fragile , open land			2
the @entity240 concluded that while the solar plant would impose ' significant impacts on the environment ... the benefits the project would provide override those impacts			1
' uniting powers : the gigantic green energy project is a joint mission between @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity18 looking at the man in the mirror : @entity158 stands near some of 300,000 computer - controlled mirrors on the @entity7 all under control : workers monitor more than 300,000 mirrors from the @entity7 's high tech control room field of ( green ) dreams : the field of mirrors sprawls over five square miles of the @entity2 on the border of @entity74 and @entity75 , about 45miles southwest of @entity184 such disputes are likely to continue for years as more companies seek to develop solar , wind and geothermal plants on land treasured by environmentalists who also support the growth of renewable energy			1
at issue is what is worth preserving and at what cost , as @entity75 pushes to generate more electricity from renewable sources			2
in 2012 , the federal government established 17 ' solar energy zones ' in an attempt to direct development to land it has identified as having fewer wildlife and natural - resource obstacles			0
the zones comprise about 450 square miles in six states â€” @entity75 , @entity74 , @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity288			1
the @entity289 is continuing to push a lawsuit against federal agencies that reviewed the @entity7 project			0
its @entity75 director , @entity293 , said alternatives to the site were not considered and serious environmental impacts , including fragmenting the tortoise population , were ignored			0
' do we really need to have these giant plants first , or is it better to generate solar power on people 's roofs , the place it 's going to be used ? ' @entity293 asked			1
@entity80 did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit			0
@entity102 said a key issue for the industry will be maintaining government policies that encourage development , including tax credits for solar projects that are set to expire in 2016 and government loan guarantees			0
' the direct result of these policies is projects like @entity7 , ' he said			0
according to statistics compiled by the @entity232 , the solar industry employs more than 140,000 @entity88 at about 6,100 companies , with employment increasing nearly 20 percent since the fall of 2012 .			0

the @entity7 , the world 's largest solar plant of its kind , recently switched on
the plants is located on five square miles of the @entity2 , near the @entity75 / @entity74 border
state energy officials have released photos of bird with singed feathers from flying into the hot ' thermal flux ' around the towers , which can reach 1,000 degrees @entity14
the plant is made up of three generating units surrounded by more than 300,000 reflecting mirrors
at full power it produces enough electricity for 140,000 homes but is still *attracting* *controversy* over environment
