@entity0 is now facing backlash over her record - breaking 110 - mile swim from @entity3 to @entity4 as other members of the small community of marathon swimmers are questioning whether she cheated			1
on social media and the online @entity10 , long - distance swimmers have been debating whether 64 - year - old @entity0 got a boost from the boat that was accompanying her - either by getting in it or holding onto it - during a particularly speedy stretch of her swim			1
they also question whether she violated the traditions of her sport - many follow strict guidelines known as the @entity21 rules - by using a specialized mask and wetsuit to protect herself from jellyfish			0
' when you know how hard it is , you kind of want those details , ' said @entity29 , a @entity30 long - distance swimmer who crunched the data available from the gps positions tracked on @entity0 's website and concluded that he did n't trust what he saw			1
' never give up ' : @entity0 emerges from the @entity35 after completing a 110 - mile swim from @entity3 to @entity37 , @entity4 @entity0 's navigator and one of the swim 's official observers told @entity42 this weekend that @entity0 did n't cheat and that she was aided during the rapid part of her swim by a swift current			1
neither @entity0 nor her team ever said she would follow @entity21 rules , developed for swimming the waters between @entity49 and @entity50			1
those rules outlaw neoprene wetsuits and contact with a support boat			0
@entity0 wore a full non-neoprene bodysuit , gloves , booties and a silicone mask at night , when jellyfish are a particular problem , and removed the suit once she got over the reef on her approach to @entity37			2
according to @entity0 's team , she finished the swim monday afternoon after roughly 53 hours in the water , becoming the first to do so without a shark cage			1
it was her fifth try , an endeavor apparently free from the boat troubles , bad weather , illnesses and jellyfish encounters that have bedeviled @entity0 and other swimmers in recent years			1
@entity74 : @entity0 's navigator said the above ' spot trackers ' used by her critics to claim she cheated are not accurate @entity0 's progress was tracked online via @entity74 by her team , and some critics say they think information is missing			1
many wonder about a roughly seven - hour stretch when @entity0 apparently did n't stop to eat or drink , recalling her 2012 attempt when she got onto the boat for hours during rough weather			1
@entity0 eventually got back into the water to try finishing , but her team was criticized for delaying the release of that information to the public			1
@entity29 said the hours - long spike in @entity0 's speed after 27 hours of swimming is particularly questionable - she went from her normal pace of roughly 1.5 mph to more than 3 mph , then slowed down again as she approached @entity37			1
@entity0 's spokeswomen did not immediately return telephone calls this weekend , but her navigator and @entity98 , one of the official observers for the swim , told the @entity42 that @entity0 did n't cheat			1
secret weapon : this is @entity0 's first attempt using the prosthetic face mask custom - made to shield her from the paralyzing stings of the box jellyfish , which some fellow swimmers consider to be cheating navigator @entity107 said the increased speed was due to the fast - moving @entity109 working in her favor , nothing more			1
' at some points we were doing almost 4 miles an hour , ' @entity107 said			0
' that 's just the way it works			0
if the current is in your favor at all , that explains it			0
' the data collected by @entity107 and two observers will be submitted to three open - water swimming associations and the @entity125 for verification , @entity107 said			0
an oceanographer not affiliated with @entity0 's team said the swimmer could n't have picked a more perfect current to get from @entity131 to @entity37			2
@entity132 of @entity135 - based @entity134 's @entity133 said he got an email questioning whether @entity0 's swim was a hoax , so he decided to look at the charts for himself			1
what he saw convinced him that she could do it			0
' many times that current runs west - east and you 're constantly fighting the current if you 're swimming north			0
in this case , it was in the shape of an @entity149 , and the angle was almost exactly from @entity131 to @entity37 , ' @entity134 said			0
close to shore : @entity0 pictured about two miles out from shore in the @entity153			2
her critics feel that there is a chance she got out of the water and went on board the accompanying boat @entity98 , a @entity37 boat captain and acquaintance of @entity0 's , was called to be an observer for the swim when @entity163 , a former @entity165 national open - water coach , was unable to make it			1
' i can say unequivocally she swam every stroke without question , ' @entity98 said			0
critics have said @entity98 was too close to @entity0 to be an independent observer of her swim			2
@entity98 has in the past helped @entity0 by providing housing for her when the swimmer stayed in the @entity153 , but she said she remained on the periphery of @entity0 's team			2
' i think anyone who knows me knows me as a person of high integrity			0
i believe that 's why @entity0 asked me , and i took my job very seriously , ' @entity98 said			2
' she was giving her all and i would give her my best			0
' since none of the various open - water swimming associations dictate how someone should swim from @entity3 to @entity4 - officially accomplished only by @entity0 and @entity186 , who used a shark cage - @entity0 just had to follow generally accepted rules about not getting out of the water or using equipment such as fins			1
@entity193 @entity192 followed @entity21 rules in her attempt to swim the @entity196 in june			0
she had to be pulled from the water after 11 hours after being stung jellyfish			0
more than just encouraging words ? some other swimmers say that an uptick in her speed mid race implies that she may have gotten a boost of oxygen from her team ' generally the rules are : you walk in , you swim across and you walk out , and you do it under your own power , ' said @entity163 , who consulted with @entity0 for this swim and observed her attempts in 2011 and 2012			1
the elaborate , full - body wet suit and protective mask @entity0 wore to protect herself from venomous jellyfish actually weighed her down , @entity163 said			2
' to put that on is like putting on a wedding gown in the ocean , ' he said			0
' it 's different from the @entity21 rules , but the water is different from the @entity21			0
' to many , it seems @entity0 has n't exactly endeared herself to those in the marathon swimming community			2
some consider her primarily concerned with gaining the spotlight instead of helping others advance the sport			0
when i 'm 64 ! @entity0 entered the history books after completing the swim without a shark cage exhausted : the grandmother appeared to he covered in salt after the length of time she spent in the water at her post-swim news conference on tuesday , @entity0 admitted that she had not been rooting for @entity240 and that she was miffed some members of her team would jump ship to work for a competitor			1
@entity192 said she was disappointed to hear @entity0 call those crew members ' traitors			2
' ' one of the greatest things , i believe , about international marathon swimming is how people across the world support crew for and mentor each other			0
i would n't change this aspect of our sport for the world ! ' @entity192 posted on her @entity258 page .			0

@entity0 completed the swim in *52* hours , *54* minutes and 18 seconds
*skeptics* think she may have gotten a boost of oxygen from her team or even gone on the boat during the 110 - mile course
