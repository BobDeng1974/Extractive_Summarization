the @entity1 government has called for @entity2 to hand control over its finances to the @entity5 in what would be an unprecedented expansion of @entity9 ' power			1
under the plan , in order for the embattled country to receive a second bail - out - now estimated at up to € 145bn ( £ 122bn ) - a eurozone ' budget commissioner ' would be given the power to decide @entity18 ' tax and spending , the proposed power grab , revealed today by the @entity21 , would be met by strong opposition in @entity18 , where anti-german protests have already been seen on the streets and in the media			1
@entity2 prime minister @entity26 is yet to comment on the proposal from chancellor @entity29 's government			2
the plan would see his state stripped of its power to control tax and spending voters in @entity2 have already expressed anger about @entity5 moves to intervene in its reform process , and any proposal to surrender yet more powers to @entity9 could prompt further protests			1
under the extraordinary extension of @entity44 control , the commissioner would be able to veto decisions taken by the @entity2 government if they were not in line with targets set by international lenders			1
the proposal , which highlights the deep level of mistrust between @entity2 and other @entity5 countries , was apparently circulated to finance ministry officials from the eurozone countries yesterday afternoon			1
' given the disappointing compliance so far , @entity2 has to accept shifting budgetary sovereignty to the @entity44 level for a certain period of time , " the document reportedly says			2
" budget consolidation has to be put under a strict steering and control system			1
" many @entity2 are already protesting against moves by the @entity5 to force a cut in state spending the @entity1 plan comes after months of worsening relationships between @entity5 member states and @entity2			1
the appointment of economist @entity71 as technocratic prime minister in november has not helped improve attitudes towards the financially stricken country			2
the proposal comes amid intense talks to finalise the second rescue package for @entity2 , which has repeatedly failed to meet the fiscal targets set out for it by its international lenders			2
@entity2 first needs to strike a deal with its private sector creditors in the next couple of days to unlock its next aid package and avoid a chaotic default			2
if it does not receive fresh aid , @entity2 could default as early as march , when bonds totalling € 14.5 billion ( £ 12.2 billion ) are due			2
violent protests against cuts have already rocked the @entity2 capital and voters are unlikely to take kindly to @entity5 moves to push through further reforms under the proposal , @entity18 would only be allowed to carry out normal state spending after servicing its debt			1
creditors could be assured that defaults would not occur in future			0
' if a future ( bail - out ) tranche is not disbursed , @entity2 can not threaten its lenders with a default , but will instead have to accept further cuts in primary expenditures as the only possible consequence of any non-disbursement , ' the @entity21 quotes the document as saying			0
@entity18 has not yet responded to the proposal			0
a senior @entity2 finance ministry official said it was unaware of the plan and so was not able to comment			0
' no country has put forward such a proposal at the @entity118 , ' a @entity2 finance ministry official said on condition of anonymity , adding that the government would not formally comment on reports based on unnamed sources			0
meanwhile , @entity2 's international lenders have apparently increased the figure they believe the indebted country will need from the euro zone from 130 billion ( £ 109bn ) to 145 billion euros ( £ 122bn )			0
@entity1 news magazine @entity128 reported that the extra 15 billion ( £ 13bn ) euros were needed because of the deteriorating economic situation in @entity2			0
@entity128 quoted a representative of the troika of foreign leaders - the @entity134 , @entity135 and the @entity136 - saying : ' we 're assuming that it wo n't be possible to collect missing money solely from the private creditors			0
' talks with private creditors on swapping existing @entity2 bonds for longer - term debt made significant progress on legal and technical issues and will continue saturday , both sides said late on friday			0
a preliminary deal could be sealed by sunday evening , a @entity2 government official said , with the aim of submitting a public offer to bondholders by feb. 15			0
however , @entity5 economic and monetary affairs commissioner @entity152 told @entity153 on thursday more public money will be needed to make up a shortfall in the second bailout for @entity2 even if private bondholders agree to take a share of losses			1
@entity152 said euro zone governments and @entity5 institutions would need to make up the difference so that @entity2 's public debt can be reduced to close to 120 percent of annual output by 2020 , seen as a more sustainable level			1
' we are preparing a package which will pave the way for a sustainable solution for @entity2 , and in that package , yes , on the basis of the revised debt sustainability analysis , there is likely to be some increased need of official sector funding , but not anything dramatic , ' @entity152 said			0
it was the first time a top @entity5 official had spelled out that more public money than the planned 130 billion euros would be required for a second @entity2 bailout package			1
@entity1 , @entity181 and other euro zone states have so far described the 130 billion ( £ 109bn ) figure agreed in october as a red line that must not be crossed			0
@entity152 declined to say how big the funding shortfall would be			0
but an @entity5 source said there could be a funding shortfall of 12 to 15 billion euros .			1
