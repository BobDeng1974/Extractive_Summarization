by @entity0 last updated at 7:22 pm on 11th august 2011 peace talks between @entity6 and the @entity4 , which were being held in secret , have been ' blown out of the water ' after details - including the identification of the @entity4 's negotiator - were leaked			1
in a bitter blow to both parties , @entity9 , @entity4 leader @entity10 's former private secretary , was outed as the man leading his side 's negotiations , which have been halted in their infancy			2
the breakdown of the talks , which began before the death of @entity20 , has sparked claims that the details of the clandestine meetings were deliberately leaked by ' paranoid ' @entity25 government figures			1
@entity9 , the former private secretary to @entity4 leader @entity10 , has been outed as the man leading the negotiations it has come to light that the meetings , designed to broker a peace deal between the terrorist group and its opponents who have fought a decade - long bloody war in @entity25 and on the @entity37 border , took place in @entity39 and @entity40 this year			1
it is alleged that @entity9 met with senior officials from the @entity43 and @entity44 , and the discussions were mediated by @entity46 , @entity39 's special representative for @entity25 and @entity37			1
@entity48 diplomats indicated that the negotiations had only been at the preliminary stage , and were designed to show the @entity4 , who admitted to the 9/11 attacks 10 years ago which killed 3,000 people , that the @entity6 and its allies are deadly serious about forging peace			2
the diplomats told the @entity56 that the terrorist group 's leaders were wary of opening talks with the @entity6 , as they thought that the @entity6 only wanted to find out their movements			0
@entity39 's special representative for @entity25 and @entity37 @entity46 was reported to be mediating the discussions further , the leaders believed that if news of the discussions were publically aired , they would lose face and credibility in the wake of their former leader , @entity20 's killing in may			1
however , following just three meetings - one in @entity40 and the other two in @entity39 held in march and april - details have been leaked to the @entity72 and @entity39 newspaper @entity73 - both named @entity9 as the principal @entity4 negotiator			1
sources suggest that @entity9 has not been seen since the revelations , despite the efforts of @entity6 officials , who attempted to contact him through intermediaries in @entity80 and @entity81 in @entity37			0
according to the leaks , talks between the @entity6 and the @entity4 had taken place before he was killed in may ' the talks were a big deal , the real thing , ' a source ' close to the talks ' told the @entity56			2
' i hope people will learn the lesson on the importance of confidentiality in the early stages			0
people in the @entity6 are horrified about what has happened			0
' meanwhile other sources in @entity99 - the second largest city in @entity25 - also agreed that the discussions had been ' blown out of the water '			2
for years the @entity4 had rejected @entity25 president , @entity104 's attempts to get around the negotiation table			0
however , details of contact with a senior aide to @entity10 sparked quiet confidence in @entity99 - @entity6 officials wanted to keep the @entity25 government in the loop , so told them of the meetings			1
the former deputy @entity116 representative in @entity99 and an expert on the @entity4 , @entity114 believes that the leaking of the meeting 's details will be hugely damaging to both sides			2
' the @entity4 have long claimed that they will drive the foreigners out by force before contemplating talks , ' he told the @entity56			0
' they need a period of confidential contact to satisfy themselves that there is something serious on offer to warrant them taking the big step of acknowledging that negotiations have to start now and not after things have been settled on the battlefield			1
' when the fact that talks had taken place and the identity of the @entity4 envoy were leaked the @entity4 shifted into their version of damage control			0
' the leadership put it about that the contacts were nothing out of the ordinary			0
' they were just routine discussions about prisoner releases , which a movement at war has to undertake periodically			0
' it is hardly surprising that the @entity4 chose to downplay the significance of @entity9 's mission			0
' in terms of progress towards negotiations which might end the war , it has proved a case of one step forward and two steps back			1

only three meetings took place - one in @entity40 and the other two in @entity39
negotiations began before @entity20 killing in may
expert : one step forward , two steps back
