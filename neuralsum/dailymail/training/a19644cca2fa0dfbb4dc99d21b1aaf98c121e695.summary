living in a suburb could be putting you at risk of obesity and even heart disease			1
contradictory to the view that living in rural spaces makes you fitter and healthier , researchers have discovered it can actually increase the rates of these diseases			2
they found that the more compact an area is , and the lower the number of intersections or road junctions it has , the lower the chances of diabetes and heart disease			1
researchers from @entity19 examined street network density in areas across @entity22 ( stock image )			1
they compared these networks to data in the @entity26			2
the results revealed that the more compact a city is , the lower the levels of obesity , diabetes and heart disease it has women who live in urban areas are more likely to develop postnatal depression than those who live in the countryside , recent research has claimed			1
women who live in large cities are three per cent more likely to develop the condition five to 14 months after giving birth			0
the researchers believe this could be because city living is more stressful and is associated with less supportive communities			2
dr @entity46 , at @entity47 , in @entity48 , said : ‘ living in an urban area is a marker of more stress , less support and a potentially higher risk of postpartum depression for women			0
‘ our study suggests we need to better target our supports and services towards women based on their geographic location to improve their outcomes and reduce their risk of postpartum depression			2
’ the researchers do not explain why this is the case , but suggest it may be due to the tendency of people in rural spaces to use their car more , and walk less , because of poor public transport options			0
‘ previously we had found that people drive less and walk more in more compact cities with more intersections per square mile , ’ said study co-author dr @entity72 , assistant professor of engineering at the @entity19			1
‘ now we ’ve been able to link these city design qualities to better health			2
’ the study , co-authored by dr @entity80 , associate professor of engineering at the @entity81 , was published in the @entity82			0
it looked at 24 medium - sized @entity22 cities with populations between 30,000 and 100,000			0
‘ we built these dense , connected street networks for thousands of years , but only over the last century or so did we switch to designing sparse , tree - like networks with cars in mind , ’ @entity80 said			0
the researchers examined street network density , connectivity and configuration			1
they then studied data collected by the @entity26 for the years 2003 , 2005 , 2007 and 2009 - sampling between 42,000 and 51,000 adults			1
the results revealed that increased intersection density was significantly linked to a reduction in obesity at the neighbourhood level , and of obesity , diabetes , high blood pressure , and heart disease at the city level			1
the more intersections , the lower the disease rates			2
the study additionally found a correlation between wider streets with more lanes and increased obesity and diabetes rates			1
this graph reveals the types of networks the researchers discovered			0
they include the tight grid - like systems and the more linear , ' tree ' systems			0
the study additionally found a correlation between wider streets with more lanes and increased obesity and diabetes rates the reason , the researchers said , was that wider streets may suggest smaller , or ‘ inferior ’ pavements			1
the presence of a superstore also tends to be indicative of poor walkability in a neighbourhood , and this was associated with almost a 14 per cent rise in obesity rates , and a 25 per cent increase in diabetes rates			1
unsurprisingly , cities with more fast food restaurants were associated with higher diabetes rates , and additional convenience - type stores across a city also correlated with higher rates of obesity and diabetes			2
these images plot the typical evolution of community design and street networks in the @entity153			0
it began with the grid ( pictured left ) , but gradually developed into the ' tree ' system ( right ) as planners tried to incorporate more green and open spaces , explained the researchers ‘ while it is possible to lead an active , healthy lifestyle in almost any type of neighbourhood , ’ dr @entity72 said			0
‘ our findings suggest that people living in more compact cities do tend to have better health			0
' dr @entity80 point continued that in a earlier study , they had found these more compact cities also had much lower levels of traffic fatalities			1
‘ taken together these findings suggest a need to radically re-think how we design and build the streets and street networks that form the backbone of our cities , towns and villages , ’ @entity80 said			0
‘ this research is one more in a long line that demonstrates the myriad advantages of fostering walkable places			0

researchers examined street network density and configuration
they then studied data collected by the @entity26
results revealed that the more compact a city is , the lower the levels of obesity , diabetes and heart disease it has
the density of a city was based on the number of intersections
study also found link between between wider streets and high obesity rates
