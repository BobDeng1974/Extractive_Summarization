smiling and waving , @entity1 victim @entity0 leaves a treatment centre in @entity3 after being given the all - clear for the disease			1
the mother - of - three , a vendor at an outdoor market , was given little chance of survival when she had arrived at the medical centre eight days ago , but has now been allowed to return to her family in @entity13			1
@entity1 kills around 70 per cent of those who become infected , and yesterday the @entity15 announced that the death toll in @entity17 has passed 4,000 , so @entity0 knows she is one of the lucky few			1
@entity3 's crumbling health service is already struggling to cope with the flood of @entity1 cases , and with health workers set to walk out at midnight tomorrow in a strike over pay and conditions , cases like @entity0 's could become even rarer			1
going home : @entity0 , a mother - of - three from @entity3 , leaves an ebola treatment centre after being given the all - clear lucky : she was given little chance of survival when she arrived at the centre eight days ago as @entity1 kills 70 per cent of those infected losing battle : however cases like @entity0 's could become even rarer as @entity3 health workers threaten to walk from tomorrow night demanding better pay and conditions , and more safety equipment nurses and doctors working in @entity1 treatment centres say they are not being provided with enough safety gear , and are demanding better pay and working conditions			1
talks with the government today ended with officials refusing to meet the workers ' demands , and if nothing changes by midnight tomorrow , then hundreds of patients could be left without care			2
' the government of @entity3 has not changed their posture			2
they do not want to engage us so that we can talk , ' @entity53 said			0
' @entity56 is running out , by 1200 midnight on monday morning , we will be starting the go - slow action			0
' @entity3 's deputy health minister @entity58 said the government was not aware of health workers planning to strike			2
' what i do know is that the government has reached an agreement with health workers for their payment , which will be as of september , beginning monday , ' @entity58 said			2
but @entity53 denied the workers had reached any agreement with the government			0
he accused the administration of trying to divide the workers			0
deadly : more than 2,000 people have already died in @entity3 , among them 95 health workers			1
if medical centre staff do walk out tomorrow , it will potentially leave thousands of @entity1 patients without care happy : @entity0 poses with a photographer at the medical centre			1
the mother - of - three , a market vendor , will now be allowed to go home ' the problem is the government			1
the public should get angry with the government , not with us , ' @entity53 said ' the public is aware that health workers are dying because they are not protected			0
nobody is supposed to die while protecting lives , we have been calling on the government to give us protective gear but they are not doing so , ' he said			0
@entity3 has the highest number of infections and deaths of the worst outbreak of the viral haemorrhagic fever that has killed 2,316 people in the poor @entity17 nation			0
a lack of education among the population , and denial about the spread of @entity1 , often leads to populations in slums turning against @entity1 teams sent to retrieve dead bodies , or treat @entity1 patients , as people falsely believe it is the doctors who are bringing the disease in			0
healthcare systems in @entity3 as well as in @entity112 and @entity113 , where the outbreak was first recorded in march , have been overwhelmed by the epidemic			0
the disease has also spread to @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and the @entity120			0
celebration : staff at a medical centre cheer as patients who are now free of @entity1 are checked before leaving			0
but a threatened walk - out by some workers tomorrow threatens to spread the disease even further concern that @entity1 could spread globally has prompted international organisations and the international community to step up support for the affected countries with medical personnel , material and pledges of about $ 1billion to tackle the epidemic			1
but healthcare workers in @entity3 complain they are still working without basic protective clothing and are not receiving adequate compensation while many of them have contracted and died from the disease			2
over 4,000 people have died from @entity1 including 233 health care workers , among them 95 from @entity3 and the same number from @entity112 , according to the @entity146 .			1

@entity0 , a market vendor , smiles as she leaves treatment centre after being given all - clear for deadly virus
however if planned walk - out by health staff goes ahead tomorrow then thousands like her could be left without care
workers demanding more safety equipment and better pay as death toll in @entity3 tops 2,000 including 95 medics
