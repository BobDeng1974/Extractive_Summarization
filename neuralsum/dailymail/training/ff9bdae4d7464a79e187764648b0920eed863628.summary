lean and mean : @entity2 poses in the boxing ring ahead of his first bout on november 30 the @entity10 are just waiting on elements of the medical before they sanction his professional debut			1
a november 30 date at @entity28 has been mooted , although an opponent has not yet been decided			1
once one of @entity7 cricket 's most popular and charismatic characters , it was @entity2 's various brushes with the sport 's authorities and a raffish persona that always endeared him to the @entity39 fans			1
training : @entity2 has given up drinking and has shed more than two stone retiring : plagued by injury , when @entity2 quit cricket he said : ' i love playing @entity42 , but the decision has been made for me - i do n't think i 've been left with any other choices ' he famously lost the @entity39 vice-captaincy after getting into difficulties in a pedalo after heavy drinking - instantly immortalised in the tabloids as ' fredalo ' - following a defeat to @entity52 in the @entity53 in 2007			1

he has cycled from @entity80 to @entity81 and rowed the channel among a host of charity challenges his current weight is understood to be under 16 stone , with a desired fighting weight in the region of 15 - and - a - half stone , which would leave him on the lean side for a 6ft 4in heavyweight			0

@entity100 , the @entity101 and @entity102 heavyweight champion , insists @entity2 is only justified in fighting if his motives are genuine			2
bowing out : flintoff in action on the cricket pitch at the @entity106 in 2009 he said in september : ' @entity2 ’s as entitled as anyone to try it out and some people come to professional boxing later in life but if it ’s just some type of pr stunt then it ’s disrespectful to boxing			1
