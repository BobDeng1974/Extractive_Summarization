by @entity0 @entity1 infected patients with deadly bacteria during heart surgery between december 2008 and july 2010 , because he ' constantly changed his gloves mid-operation ' a heart surgeon who infected at least 11 patients with a bug that killed five of them is seeking to keep his past a secret when he returns to the operating theatre			1
@entity1 has been banned from performing operations since the deaths in 2009 and 2010 were triggered when he passed on the bacteria staphylococcus epidermidis to patients receiving artificial heart valves			1
the bacteria lives on the skin of most people but can be deadly if it enters the bloodstream of those with surgical implants or weak immune systems , and was allegedly passed on due to mr @entity1 ’s habit of changing gloves mid-operation			1
although the surgeon was allowed to continue his work as a consultant in the cardiac department at @entity33 ’s @entity32 , he is being allowed to return to the operating theatre only if he is open about his background with future patients			1
but in what has been described as an unprecedented case , the surgeon is taking @entity40 to the @entity41 after he refused to accept its order			2
mr @entity1 does not believe it is necessary to disclose the deaths , and the hearing next month will centre on the ‘ level of information ’ patients should receive about his background before he operates on them			0
his solicitors are expected to argue that telling patients about his past will be a restriction of trade , while the @entity40 will say that patient safety would be compromised			0
as well as the five patients who died , mr @entity1 infected six others who survived			2
@entity58 ( left ) and @entity59 ( right ) both died after being infected with staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria while mr @entity1 operated mr @entity1 was temporarily suspended before returning to work in 2013			1
he 's not allowed to operate but is fighting to be allowed to return to theatre			0
@entity63 ( left ) and @entity64 ( right ) died after mr @entity1 operated on them lawyers for the families of the five men who died told an inquest in 2010 that mr @entity1 ’s habit of changing gloves during surgery had caused the bacteria to be passed on			1
the hearing was told that of 28 patients who had valves inserted by the surgeon at @entity79 ’s @entity78 in 2009 and 2010 , 11 fell ill. on thursday , the trust sent a letter to all patients and relatives affected by the outbreak , informing them of the legal wrangle			0
mr @entity1 is locked in a legal battle with @entity40 which says he can only return to theatre if he tells his patients about his history before he operates			1
image shows @entity40 in it , bosses said they were ‘ committed ’ to bringing mr @entity1 back to surgery , but only if patients receive ‘ appropriate information ’ about his history			1
yesterday , @entity96 , whose 82 year - old father @entity64 was one of those who died , told of her shock when she read the letter about the possibility of mr @entity1 returning to surgery			2
‘ i lived through the trauma and distress of seeing my father , who was a fit and active man before having his surgery , slowly deteriorating and eventually dying as a result of the infection			0
’ a hospital spokesman said : ‘ we remain committed to mr @entity1 ’s return ... but we are determined that patients will receive appropriate information as they consider having surgery at our hospital			2
’ mr @entity1 ’s solicitors have not commented			0
@entity116 , 68 , contracted the infection after undergoing a heart valve replacement at @entity40 in june 2009			0
he said : ' the situation that happened should never be allowed to happen again '			0

@entity1 caused 11 patients to develop a *severe* infection - staphylococcus epidermidis - and five of them died as a result
he passed on the infection by ' changing his gloves during surgery '
he was *initially* suspended but returned to work in *november*
he has currently not been allowed back in an operating theatre
@entity40 has now said he can start operating again if he tells his patients about his history
he is refusing to do this and is taking the trust to the @entity41
