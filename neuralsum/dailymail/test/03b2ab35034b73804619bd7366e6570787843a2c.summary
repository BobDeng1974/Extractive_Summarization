@entity0 may have described the @entity1 as ‘ the most personal device we 've ever created ’ but reports claim the gadget does n't tolerate some individual ’s tattoos			1
owners of the coveted watch have found the timepiece 's sensors malfunction when worn on tattooed wrists			2
dark , vibrant ink seems to cause the watch ’s heart rate monitor to lose connection and give inaccurate readings			1
some dark , vibrant ink seems to cause the watch ’s heart sensor to lose connection and give inaccurate readings the issue first came to light on @entity28 and @entity29 where a number of users reported similar issues , such as having to repeatedly enter a password to unlock the phone			1
this is required every time the device detects it has left a wearer ’s wrist			0
tests suggest that tattoos in dark and solid colours interfere with the device the most			1
this is because the heart sensor reads a pulse by measuring light absorption though the skin - a process called photoplethysmography			1
' this technology , while difficult to pronounce , is based on a very simple fact : blood is red because it reflects red light and absorbs green light , @entity1 wrote on its support page			1
' @entity1 uses green led lights paired with light ‑ sensitive photodiodes to detect the amount of blood flowing through your wrist at any given moment			2
' when your heart beats , the blood flow in your wrist - and the green light absorption - is greater			1
between beats , it ’s less			0
' by flashing its led lights hundreds of times per second , @entity1 can calculate the number of times the heart beats each minute - your heart rate			1
' it is thought that red and green inks reflect light in a similar way and the sensor ca n't distinguish between the blood and tattoo			2
it appears the pigmented ink of some tattoos affects the watch 's sensor ’s ability to read an individual ’s heart rate , which in turn leads the watch to think it has stopped making contact with the skin			1
@entity1 has yet to comment on the problem , despite there being speculation that the apparent fault could also stop some people using @entity100			1
tests conducted by @entity102 suggest that tattoos in dark and solid colours interfere with the device the most			2
this is because the heart sensor reads a pulse by measuring light absorption though the skin - a process called photoplethysmography			1

so the problem seems to occur when a wearer has something on their skin that reduces the lights reflectiveness , such as ink under the skin ’s surface			2
it appears that the pigmented ink of some tattoos affects the watch 's sensor ’s ( illustrated ) ability to read an individual ’s heart rate , which in turn leads the watch to think it ’s stopped making contact with skin @entity28 user guine55fan thought his 42mm sport edition watch had a bad wrist detector sensor beacuse it locked every time the screen went dark and wouldn ; r receive notifications			1
he tried holsing it against his hand , which unlike his wrists and arm , are n't tattooed			0
' my hand is n't tattooed and the watch stayed unlocked , ' he wrote			2
' once i put it back on the area that is tattooed with black ink the watch would automatically lock again			2
' the user has told @entity1 about the problem who tried to solve the problem , but are also reporting it to their engineers			1
this does n’t include natural skin pigmentation			0
@entity102 tested the watch ’s sensors on tattooed and non-tattooed parts of wrists , as well as elsewhere on the body and found that on non-inked parts , the sensors gave uniformed readings			2
however , ‘ on tattooed sections , sensor readings varied wildly depending on colours and shading , ’ @entity190 reported			2
she said solid colours in darker inks such as black and red ‘ confused ’ the sensor the most , causing misreadings of up to 196 beats per minute ( @entity200 ) , for example			0
the average heart rate is 72 bpm			1
tests on lighter colours such as purple and yellow caused slightly elevated misreadings of @entity208 , compared to @entity209 on the wearer ’s non-tattooed wrist , but did n’t interfere with skin contact detection , unlike with darker shades of ink			0
the team was unable to reproduce problems reported on @entity29 of light , but patterned tattoos creating errors , leading them to conclude that the design and type of tattoo makes a difference in how well the watch works			1
@entity1 has yet to comment on ' tattoo-gate ' but admits on its support page that ' many factors ' can affect the performance of the @entity1 heart rate monitor			1
' skin perfusion is one , ' it says			0
' a fancy way of describing how much blood flows through your skin , skin perfusion varies significantly from person to person and can also be impacted by the environment			0
' if you ’re exercising in the cold , for example , the skin perfusion in your wrist may be too low for the heart rate sensor to get a reading			1
' @entity1 said that motion is another factor			0
' rhythmic movements , such as running or cycling , give better results compared to irregular movements , like tennis or boxing			0
' the sapphire glass screen in the @entity1 has remained scratch - free after being subjected to being rubbed with sandpaper , keyed and even hit with a hammer			0
the test was carried out by @entity258 - based @entity257 repairs specialist @entity256 , which used a sapphire screen from a 38mm @entity1 watch for its experiment			1
two out of the three models of @entity263 have sapphire glass screens - the @entity1 and @entity265			0
the glass is made from synthetic sapphire , which is created by applying heat and pressure to aluminium oxide powder , before the crystals are processed to remove impurities			0
the tiny round disks created are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			0
@entity277 glass is said to be twice as tough as normal glass and almost as hard as a diamond			0
to test the durability of the screen , it was rubbed against a stone wall and then with a coin , before being ‘ scratched ’ by a key			0
the video capturing the attempts at destruction , shows no scratches were achieved to the screen			0
it also withstood being rubbed with abrasive sandpaper at some force and hit by a hammer – albeit not very hard			0
but most impressive , was the screen ’s ability to withstand an electric drill being dragged across its surface , without leaving a mark			0
the test led @entity301 to claim : ‘ @entity277 glass is pretty strong and virtually impossible to scratch ’ .			0

tattooed @entity1 watch users reporting problems with its heart rate sensor
sensor takes readings by measuring light absorption though the skin
@entity314 , solid tattoos seem to confuse the new device the most
@entity1 has yet to comment on the problem , despite people taking to @entity29
