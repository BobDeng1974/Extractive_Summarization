in his glory - filled years as a @entity4 player you knew what you were going to get with @entity6			1
few central defenders were as comfortable on the ball while the former @entity10 captain also knew when to find @entity11 @entity6 could read the game a step or two ahead and had an iron will to win			1
he 's not a @entity4 player anymore though so what , if anything , will have changed as he returns to @entity18 to face his old employers for the first time			1
at 35 he 's no spring chicken and with his new boss @entity23 well into the numbers needed for a free bus pass , we thought the pair would be up for a game of bingo - and you can play along too			1
below is a list of things that could or should happen when @entity6 goes up against some familiar faces on his old stomping ground , just tick them off as and when they happen			1
you can like our @entity4 facebook page here @entity39 applauds both sets of fans this one 's your starter for 10			1
away fans always get a clap , during the warm - up and at the end of the game , simply for making a lot of noise			1
but @entity50 's remembered fondly at the @entity18 so expect the home fans to show their appreciation and him to return the favour			1
@entity6 is guaranteed to be doing a fair bit of clapping at @entity18 this sunday 2 - all aboard the banter bus i there will be a moment in this clash where @entity6 flies into a former team - mate			1
@entity63 could get riled and @entity64 might get fiery			0
but expect them to pick themselves up , dust themselves down , shake hands and have a laugh about it in a ' why i oughta ' sort of way			0
3 - all aboard the banter @entity73 tunnel hugs and handshakes will be the order of the day as the teams prepare to walk out at the corner of the pitch			0
it 's not @entity82 and @entity83 you know			0
do n't rule out a high - five or two			0
@entity6 and @entity63 will be on different teams in the same tunnel this time at @entity18 4 - @entity88 shot @entity89 are n't expected to have much to cheer and @entity6 goals are rarer than hens ' teeth			1
but if he does find himself in the wrong box and manages to ripple the net , he wo n't celebrate			0
no , no , no. it 's the 11th commandment after all			0
' thou shalt not rub their noses in it			0
' or something like that			0
5 - other people 's goals are different though if some other @entity89 player had to fire one in , well , that 's a different matter entirely			2
and @entity6 only knows one way to enjoy a goal			2
expect him to be pictured head and shoulders above his team - mates , hands resting on a pal 's shoulders , screaming at the fans			0
we 've seen this celebration from @entity6 many times over the year @entity6 had many happy times in the home dressing room at @entity18 6 - easy mistake to make after all these years even if @entity6 does this one for a giggle , it counts			1
walking into the wrong dressing room			0
7 - @entity125 who ? now it 's me and you at some point @entity6 and @entity23 , the new man ( ager ) in his life will get together and enjoy that special moment only a boss and his big player can enjoy			2
a cuddle or a handshake ( @entity23 's not a high - fiver ) both count			0
8 - @entity138 big players + big reputations + big salaries = massive headphones			0
look out for @entity6 getting off the bus with the cans on			2
and there 's a bonus point if it 's confirmed he 's listening to the @entity148 classic @entity50			0
it 's unlikely @entity6 is listening to @entity148 but you never know @entity50 who ? if a @entity4 new boy , signed after @entity6 's departure , steps out of line or on @entity50 's toes , expect the squaring up but without the happy ending ( see no 2 )			1
@entity6 has never been scared to stand his ground against opponents 10 - you did n't need to get me a card it wo n't be one with ' welcome back ' written on it			2
tick this one off if the ref dishes out a red or yellow to @entity6			2
with @entity4 expected to launch wave after wave of attacks , @entity6 could well pick up a card 11 - all aboard the banter bus iii mascots love the limelight these days , the furry rascals			1
if @entity174 and @entity6 have anything to do with each other , put a line through no 11			2
@entity174 will be on hand to welcome @entity6 back to his old stomping ground 12 - you never know ... if @entity6 keeps out @entity181 , @entity63 , @entity182 it really will be the game of his life			1
he picks up the champagne for @entity186 , after a 1 - 0 @entity89 win in which he scored with a bullet header , and announces he 's available for @entity10 again			2
@entity6 won 81 caps for @entity10 before retiring from international football			0
