by @entity1 reporter published : 20:17 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 04:44 est , 11 march 2014 @entity3 , 14 , has been suspended from classes at @entity5 , @entity6 , and told he must attend the school @entity8 for naughty kids ¿ a boy has been suspended from classes for five days after he called a teacher by his @entity14 name outside of school hours			1
@entity3 , 14 , has been banned from @entity5 in the mornings and in the afternoons he must attend the school ’s ‘ department for naughty kids ’			1
the school in @entity21 , @entity6 , is sponsored by @entity22 and its executive head is political historian dr @entity24			1
yesterday , @entity3 ’s mother @entity25 , 42 , demanded her son be allowed back in class ‘ as the punishment is over the top ’			1
she claimed the @entity5 was ‘ making an example ' of her son			1
@entity33 mrs @entity32 - who has already lost 106 pounds in wages staying at home to look after him - said she was only told about the punishment in an evening phone call from the teacher @entity41 @entity40 ' this happened in the village where we live - it was outside of school			1
my son was walking home and my son shouted out to him hi @entity40			1
@entity40 followed him and challenged him at school the next day and my son said he did it			1
' then i had a phone call telling me my son was not allowed in school for five days but i have had nothing in writing and no official meeting			1
the night he called the punishment was due to start the next day			2
' the teacher involved said to me your son shouted my name in a way that made me feel small and undermined			1
i said to him because i know this guy ‘ come on @entity40 he is a 14 year old kid - you should not be intimidated by a 14 year old			1
is that all he said and he said yes			2
' i would have thought if they were sanctioning something so serious then i would have been called in for a meeting and laid out on the table what was going to happen - a structured plan			2
but i have had nothing - just a phone call from the teacher involved			2
i have had nothing in writing			0
' i said to the guy on the phone that night when does this start and he said tomorrow			0
i said to him why are you phoning me ? why is the principle not phoning me ? you have a partial view you are the victim			0
you should not be phoning me			0
' i said i have clients booked in and i am a single parent with a mortgage and three kids			1
i just can not afford to cut clients			0
i have lost about 106 pounds			0
@entity90 - who is @entity91 , pictured - confirmed the boy was now subject to ¿ five days alternative learning ¿ following the incident ' i stayed at home the first morning to look after him but then i had to leave him in the house on his own but i did not want too			2
i had to go to work			0
' principle @entity96 was yesterday unavailable for comment			0
but @entity90 - who is @entity91 - admitted the boy was now subject to ‘ five days alternative learning ’ which was a ‘ relatively new sanction ’ for what he had done			2
and he admitted the comment may have been made ‘ on the @entity105 ’ outside of school hours			2
but he stressed : ' he has been sanctioned for an accumulation of incidents			0
it was not a one off - it was a tipping point			0
over a period of time there are a number of young people and @entity3 is one of them who have been involved in repeated and systematic undermining of staff by shouting things behind backs and under breath			1
' the five days alternative learning is not simply because he said @entity40 to a member of staff in the street			0
shouting someone ’s name however jovial it might be in a group situation it is it not as abstract from the parents point of view ' we acted proportionately			0
but i do take that procedurally things need to be @entity134 was an error - we should have made contract with mum			0
' a recent @entity139 report says it required improvement .			0
