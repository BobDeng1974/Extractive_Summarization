by @entity1 reporter published : 03:19 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 12:54 est , 2 august 2012 @entity3 head @entity2 says the bank is ready to intervene in the bond market to drive down countries ' high borrowing rates , and urged @entity9 leaders to get their bailout fund ready to intervene as well			1
@entity2 said today the bank could buy bonds if the borrowing rates stop the @entity3 in its efforts to spread its low interest rates throughout the 17 countries that use the currency			1
such a move could , crucially , lower the borrowing rates that are threatening to push @entity19 and @entity20 into financial disaster			1
@entity2 said today the bank could buy bonds if the borrowing rates stop the @entity3 in its efforts to spread its low interest rates throughout the 17 countries that use the currency at a meeting earlier today @entity2 indicated that any @entity3 intervention would start at the earliest in september and would depend on countries in trouble on bond markets making a request and accepting strict conditions and supervision			1
he also indicated that @entity33 central bank chief @entity32 had expressed reservations about bond - buying and further efforts would be needed to persuade the @entity37 before a final vote to take action			0
at a news conference following the central bank 's monthly meeting , @entity2 said the bank would consider other ' non-standard ' measures to rein in the euro zone crisis			2
' the @entity58 , within its mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term and in observance of its independence in determining monetary policy , may undertake outright open market operations of a size adequate to reach its objective , ' @entity2 said after the bank kept euro zone interest rates at a record low 0.75 percent			1
the bank has already spent 210 billion euros buying bonds under its now dormant @entity64 ( @entity64 ) since may 2010 , with limited impact , but @entity2 said the new effort would be different in scope and conditionality			1
any new @entity3 action was conditional on euro zone governments using their @entity71 and @entity73 bail out funds first , he said			2
calling for action : @entity77 treasury secretary @entity76 said the euro zone must cut borrowing costs ' governments must stand ready to activate the @entity73 / @entity71 in the bond market when exceptional financial market circumstances and risks to financial stability exist , ' he said			1
financial markets seemed underwhelmed by the announcements , with some investors having interpreted @entity2 's comments last week as a sign of imminent rather than future and conditional action			1
@entity2 said all members of the @entity58 endorsed today 's statement with one exception - a reference to @entity96 president @entity32 ' it is quite disappointing ... there is a lack of any action so he has basically passed the buck back on to politicians , ' said @entity104 , strategist at @entity105			2
@entity33 bund futures extended gains , a sign of investors seeking safety , and the euro fell by more than one cent to below $ 1.22 at 1330 @entity113 other countries , especially the @entity77 , have sought to raise pressure on the @entity3 to act over the @entity117 crisis			1
@entity77 treasury secretary @entity76 said the euro zone must take steps to bring down borrowing costs in troubled member states			0
his comments in @entity124 last thursday that the @entity3 would do whatever it takes within its mandate to protect the currency bloc from collapse - ' and believe me , it will be enough ' - had already eased tensions on the debt markets			2
other countries , especially the @entity77 , have raised pressure on the @entity3 to act as the two - and - a - half year old euro zone crisis weighs on global growth			2
the @entity136 dashed expectations among some investors on wednesday by taking no immediate new measures to revive the economy			0
the @entity136 stopped short of offering new monetary stimulus , though it signalled more strongly that further bond buying could be in store to help a @entity77 economic recovery that it said had lost momentum this year			0
the future is bleak : experts warn of months of uncertainty for the euro zone @entity3 action , meanwhile , is hamstrung by @entity152 rules forbidding it from financing governments			0
the @entity3 issued a legal opinion in march 2011 ruling out perhaps the biggest gun , giving the @entity73 bailout fund rights to tap the @entity3 for funds to increase its firepower			1
the @entity3 also has to find a way to get any measures past @entity33 , the euro zone 's largest economy and its principal paymaster			0
the @entity37 issues regular reminders of inflationary dangers stemming from non-standard measures such as bond purchases and the limits central banks face			0
@entity2 said all members of the @entity58 endorsed thursday 's statement with one exception - a reference to @entity96 president @entity32			0
' the decision to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro as a stable currency has been unanimous , ' @entity2 said			2
' it 's clear and it 's known that ( @entity33 's ) @entity37 have their reservations about the programme of buying bonds			0
the idea is we now have the guidance , the monetary policy committee , the risk committee and the markets committee will work on this guidance and then ( we ) will take a final decision and the votes will be counted			0
' his wording suggested he was prepared to outvote the @entity33 central banker if necessary .			0
