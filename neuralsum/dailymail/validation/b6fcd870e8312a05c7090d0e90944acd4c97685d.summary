@entity1 midfielder @entity0 admits it took longer than they expected to turn their season around but he now has every confidence they can make it a success			1
a dreadful start to the campaign saw them slip to 10th , seven points off the minimum requirement of a top - four place , in mid-december and exit the @entity14 at the group stage			1
since then , however , they have taken 30 points from their 12 subsequent @entity18 matches to put themselves firmly in the mix for a top - four place and have an @entity22 quarter - final replay against @entity24 side @entity23 to face next month			1
@entity0 ( centre ) warms up with @entity26 and @entity27 ( right ) last week @entity0 ( left ) trains with team - mate @entity28 and right back @entity29 ( centre ) ' we always knew we 'd turn it around but we wondered how long it was going to take			1
it did take longer than we expected , i think , ' said @entity37 midfielder @entity0			2
' losing @entity38 in the summer ( to @entity39 ) and @entity40 being out ( injured ) for so long as well and the change we had , we always knew there 'd be a little bit of a rocky patch but we did n't expect it to go on so long			2
' we put expectation on ourselves because we think we 're good enough to go on runs like this			0
@entity1 manager @entity49 is trying to tie down a number of his first - team stars to longer deals @entity53 and @entity54 ( right ) battle each other as they go for a sprint during training ' with the players we 've got , and the confidence we 're playing with , i think it 's a case of long may it continue			1
' the turnaround came after their @entity14 failure was followed immediately by a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity66 , their main rival for a top - four spot			1
a change in system to a 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 formation has brought the best out of a number of players , particularly 22 - year - old playmaker @entity75 and utility man @entity53 , who recently turned 21			2
@entity1 goalkeeper @entity26 gets down low to his right to stop a ball with his hand in training @entity1 striker @entity82 strikes one on the volley with his left foot during training @entity86 works on his fitness and conditioning with @entity1 coach @entity89 ( left ) ' people forget sometimes that we 're a pretty young team and squad , ' @entity0 , who is fit again after a hip problem to face former club @entity91 this evening , told liverpoolfc.com			1
' the beauty of that is that we will get better			0
we 've shown that as the season has gone on			0
' with this run of games we 're going on , we 're really looking forward to monday night 's game and we 'll be setting our stall out to go there and pick up three points			1
' we 've grown massively and i think you can see the change in formation			0
we 've taken to that really well and quickly , which is important			0
' i think we seem to have that edge back , even if we 're not playing the most flowing football or things are n't going 100 per cent to plan , we still look like we 're going to get the result and i think that speaks volumes about how much everyone has taken things forward			0
' manager @entity49 is keen to keep the nucleus of this young side together , and while contract negotiations with @entity123 and @entity124 have dragged on for several months now they have just opened talks with the 24 - year - old @entity0 over a new deal			1
' we 're at the early stages at the moment but the signs are good , ' he told @entity130			0
' from my point of view i 'm looking to commit my future here and hopefully i can be here for years to come			0
' for me it 's just a case of playing regularly and putting in consistent performances			0
i 've always been confident that i 'll be able to be successful here			0
