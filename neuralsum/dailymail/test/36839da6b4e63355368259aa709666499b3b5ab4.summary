the fact @entity1 and sir @entity2 are the leading wicket - takers in @entity5 history proves cricket is a game in which players of completely different character can thrive			1
it takes a range of types to make a successful team and you could not get more contrasting personalities than sir @entity2 and the quiet lad from @entity18 who broke his @entity20 wicket - taking record on friday night			1
when i played for @entity5 we had @entity23 , meticulous and well organised , opening the batting with that scruffy herbert @entity25			0
@entity1 celebrates taking a record 384th @entity5 wicket for @entity5 against the @entity27 on friday the 32 - year - old is congratulated by his @entity5 team - mates following the dismissal of @entity31 then we had @entity32 , who needed reassurance and an arm round the shoulder , opening the bowling with a character in @entity38 who loved the limelight and wanted to be the centre of attention			1
@entity2 was always larger than life and in your face , had huge self - belief as a player and still has an aura about him now			2
when sir @entity2 walks into a room everybody notices him			2
@entity1 , by contrast , would go unnoticed if he walked into a room			0
he shuns the limelight — so unlike the angry youth we so often see on the field			1
sir @entity2 watches on and applauds as @entity1 beats the former @entity5 cricketer 's @entity5 record @entity2 gives two thumbs up as he watches the action unfold during the test match in @entity60 the quality they do share is their stubbornness			1
i have never heard @entity2 admit he was wrong about anything			0
the only smidgeon of self - doubt came when admitting he perhaps should n’t have taken on the @entity27 so often with the hook			0
that absolute belief that he is right about everything was what made @entity2 the cricketer he was			0
@entity1 , too , knows the way he wants to do things and does n’t like to be told to do it any other way			2
he had a bit of an argument with @entity82 on the fourth evening of this test			0
@entity82 wanted to keep the slips in but @entity1 has been worried about batsmen rotating the strike and taking singles his whole career and wanted the chance to go at certain players for the whole of an over			0
@entity2 will be very happy for @entity1 he is not one of those former players who look at records and hope they stay at the top of the tree			2
the 59 - year - old was one of the first people to congratulate @entity1 after the test match had finished @entity82 had to remind the leader of his attack that @entity5 had more than 400 to play with and needed to attack so the captain got his way , even though @entity1 looked grumpy about it			1
the point is , you do not have to have the same rules for every player in your team			0
there really can be one rule for sir @entity2 and there can be a different rule for @entity1			1
@entity1 was one of the nicest blokes i captained and i was delighted when he broke sir @entity2 ’s record here			1
you could see how much it meant to the @entity5 team , too , who were urging him towards this landmark			0
@entity2 , up in the commentary box with us , was very happy for @entity1			2
he has been waiting to give @entity1 some wine and now he will hand it over gladly			0
@entity2 has always been larger than life and showed huge self - belief as a player and he still has an aura @entity5 's @entity82 takes the catch as @entity1 celebrates taking his record - breaking wicket clearly a popular figure , @entity1 is swamped by his team - mates following the all - important wicket			1

@entity1 becomes @entity5 's leading test match wicket - taker
@entity1 *surpasses* sir @entity2 will 384th @entity5 dismissal
32 - year - old shuns the limelight - so unlike the angry youth we so often see on the field
@entity2 was always larger than life and in your face
both are stubborn and do *n't* like to be told to do it any other way
