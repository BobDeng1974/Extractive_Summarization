by @entity0 @entity1 is often depicted as a pointy - prowed traditional ship			1
but new research suggests it was very different from popular imagining , and was actually a circular craft made out of reeds			2
dr @entity7 reveals his ground - breaking discovery into the ancient myth in his new book called in @entity11 : decoding @entity12			1
as an expert in deciphering cuneiform script , dr @entity7 managed to piece together information on the ark from a 3,700 - year - old clay tablet			1
new revelation : according to an ancient @entity21 tablet , @entity1 was a 220 - ft wide coracle - the equivalent of six @entity25 buses - with walls 20 - ft high his translation of the ancient text throws light on the @entity31 story , which became the account in @entity33 in the @entity34 , of @entity1 and the ark that saved his menagerie from the flood waters which drowned every other living thing on earth			1
the text describes god speaking to @entity42 , a @entity44 king who is the @entity1 figure in earlier versions of the ark story			2
he says : ' @entity48 , wall ! @entity50 wall , reed wall ! @entity53 - @entity52 , pay heed to my advice , that you may live forever ! destroy your house , build a boat ; despise possessions and save life ! draw out the boat that you will built with a circular design ; let its length and breadth be the same			0
' dr @entity7 , assistant keeper of the @entity66 at the @entity67 , translated the cuneiform script on the tablet the ancient @entity21 text describes the ark as a round 220 - ft diameter coracle with walls 20 - ft high			1
according to the tablet , the ark had two levels and a roof on the top			0
the craft was divided into sections to divide the various animals into their own sections			0
the 60 lines of text , which dr @entity7 describes as a ' detailed construction manual for building an ark ' , claims the craft was built using ropes and reeds before being smeared with bitumen to make it waterproof			1
there are dozens of ancient tablets that have been found which describe the flood story but @entity7 , assistant keeper of @entity31 script , languages and cultures @entity101 at the @entity67 , says this one is the first to describe the vessel 's shape			1
' in all the images ever made people assumed the ark was , in effect , an ocean - going boat , with a pointed stem and stern for riding the waves â€“ so that is how they portrayed it , ' said @entity7			0
' but the ark did n't have to go anywhere , it just had to float , and the instructions are for a type of craft which they knew very well			0
it 's still sometimes used in @entity122 and @entity123 today , a type of round coracle which they would have known exactly how to use to transport animals across a river or floods			0
' @entity131 is now planning a documentary based on the reconstruction of the ark following the guidelines on the tablet which dates from about 1850 bc. the artefact was discovered in the @entity138 by @entity139 , who indulged his passion for history while serving in the @entity142 from 1945 to 1948			0
the relic was passed to his son @entity144 , who took it to dr @entity7 to translate			0
@entity1 is typically portrayed at a traditional ship , such as in this @entity149 mid- 16th century painting			2

dr @entity7 has translated cuneiform text on an 3,700 - old clay tablet
the ancient script details the @entity31 story of @entity1
the text also contains instructions on how to build an ark to escape a flood
but its describes the craft as being a round 220 - ft diameter coracle
the design is very different to the popular imagining of a traditional ship
