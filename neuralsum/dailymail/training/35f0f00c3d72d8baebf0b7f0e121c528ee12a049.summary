the old saying goes that nice guys finish last			0
but @entity2 made a mockery of that , and the bookmakers here in @entity6 , to become the new middleweight champion of the world on an emotionally charged evening on the strip			1
and , although he might not describe it as such , there was a sense that the popular 30 - year - old fulfilled his destiny in front of the widow of his former trainer , the legendary @entity17 at the @entity19 arena inside the @entity20			0
@entity17 guided @entity2 through his formative years as a professional and even up until his first challenge for a world title , the unsuccessful attempt to wrestle the @entity48 title from @entity49 in 2012			1
but @entity2 was forced to go it alone four months later when @entity17 passed away until he linked up with @entity23 , who was in the corner here , and the brains behind @entity2 's preparation for this shot at the @entity29 title			1
@entity2 admitted in the week , in the suite 45 floors above the venue , that a defeat here would likely end his career , with no desire to fight his way back from another failed title challenge			2
he also said that he was completely confident of beating undefeated @entity25			2
referee @entity66 steps in to end the fight as @entity25 looks stunned while @entity2 races to celebrate until @entity2 stopped the unbeaten man , the fight had been tentative with neither fighter able to make his mark and he showed exactly why in the sixth round of this contest , which was otherwise tentative , quiet and cagey			1
in fact , the only moment of note before the stoppage was when @entity2 momentarily stiffened the @entity79 with a left hand in the centre of the ring			1
it was a sign of things to come			0
in the sixth round , @entity2 shipped a left hand but , almost immediately , connected with a right hook that is swiftly becoming his trademark			1
@entity25 tottered , stunned from the impact , and @entity2 did not waste a second , swarming the 31 - year - old			1
referee @entity92 waved it off quickly			0
the celebrations were passionate as @entity2 , truly one of boxing 's good guys , embraced his new trainer @entity23			2
his wife was also hoisted into the ring to join the new @entity29 champion			2
he is the first @entity101 middleweight to clinch a world title since @entity103 who , 20 years ago , won this very belt			1
he is also the first man from the travelling community to win a world title in the history of professional boxing			0
the decisive moment came when @entity2 landed a right hand which rocked @entity111 to his core @entity25 had edged the opening stages but had no answer when @entity2 landed the big shot in the sixth session speaking of the travelling community , this victory also sets up a mouth - watering contest between @entity2 and @entity119 , who is the mandatory challenger for the new @entity29 king			1
that is one to look forward to next year , but for now , @entity2 and his team should savour this moment and their achievement against the odds in this famous gambling district			2
when asked how to sum up the feeling of becoming champion , he said : ' it 's tough to describe			0
when i thought about this moment , i had a speech in mind			0
' i would like to say than you to my manger who has done so much for me over the last couple of years			0
' but then @entity2 paid a poignant tribute to @entity17 , whose widow @entity138 was in attendance for the bout , along with a clutch of other @entity40 natives who cheered @entity2 on from the crowd			2
he went on : ' but it 's also for the man who made me , @entity17			0
' we spent seven or eight years together and he said i would win a world title			0
the fight heats up in the middle of the ring and @entity2 was soon to finish it altogether with his stoppage @entity25 lunges forward and tries to land a left hand on @entity2 as he battles during their world title fight ' his wife @entity138 came here today , flew all the way from @entity40 so from everybody from @entity40 and @entity39 , thank you very much			1
' @entity25 was giving me nightmares but i could hear all the cheers from all that came to see me from @entity164 and @entity40			0
' we were trading and a lot of the times he was having the better of it but my right hook is a killer punch i thought he was n't going down but i was n't taking any chances			0
' @entity2 dedicated his world title win to former trainer @entity17 - who died in 2012 and what of that showdown with @entity119 ? ' i am a champion now and i want to defend my belt in @entity176 , ' he said			1
but , for now , it 's back to @entity176 to celebrate a @entity178 as world champion .			1

@entity2 *recovers* from a slow start to stop @entity25
@entity101 landed huge right hand in the sixth round to rock the @entity79
@entity2 threw a *barrage* of *unanswered* punches and the referee stepped in
@entity2 is the new @entity29 middleweight world champion
