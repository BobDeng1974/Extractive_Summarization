by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 25 april 2012 updated : 12:01 est , 25 april 2012 behind bars : @entity1 was at the very heart of the looting and rioting in @entity5 last august , according to the attorney general a riot ringleader who was at the heart of last year ’s @entity5 disorder had his sentence of four years detention nearly doubled today because it was too lenient			1
@entity1 , 20 , attacked police , robbed , pillaged and looted during a shocking orgy of ‘ mayhem and carnage ’ during last august ’s mass disorder			1
he was given 48 months in a young offender institution when he appeared at @entity18 in january			1
but attorney general @entity19 referred the case to the @entity21 on the basis that the total sentence imposed for offences of violent disorder , robbery , burglary and criminal damage on the evening of august 8 , 2011 was unduly lenient			2
today , the lord chief justice lord judge , sitting with mr @entity30 and mr @entity31 , agreed and said it should be increased to seven years			2
lord judge said : ‘ these were offences of great seriousness			0
’ the attorney general , who presented the case to the court , said later : ‘ @entity1 was at the very heart of the looting and rioting in @entity5 last august			1
‘ consider the extraordinary list of crimes that he committed : he led an attack on a police line ; robbed a bus driver who he had forced to halt ; armed himself and ransacked a shop , forcing the petrified owners to flee , only to rob them moments later in a hijack of their van ; repeatedly attacked and mugged a terrified man at a cash machine , acting as if pushing a gun into his neck ; led a gang into a supermarket , looting and vandalising ; and finally directed his group into a betting shop , destroying a fruit machine and looting the office behind the counter			2
lives at risk : images from the rioting in @entity5 became iconic of the mass violence and crime committed across @entity71 ' mayhem and carnage ' : @entity1 , 20 , led an attack on a police line ; robbed a bus driver who he had forced to halt ; armed himself and ransacked a shop during an orgy of criminality which left @entity5 devastated ‘ for this catalogue of mayhem and carnage he received a four - year sentence			1
i ’m very pleased that the @entity21 has today quashed that sentence and replaced it with one of seven years			0
’ @entity88 chief crown prosecutor @entity87 said : ‘ we referred this case to the attorney general as one that had attracted a sentence which was unduly lenient			0
' unduly lenient ' : attorney general @entity95 took action to increase @entity1 's sentence because it was too lenient ‘ i welcome the strong message that the @entity21 has now sent out as a result of this ruling			1
‘ @entity1 was a ringleader during the riots in @entity5 and his conviction for 10 offences committed that night shows the extent of his criminality			1
‘ his offences were amongst the most serious which @entity88 has prosecuted in relation to the summer riots and this increased sentence reflects that			0
’ @entity1 , of @entity112 , west @entity71 , buried his head in his hands as he sat in the dock of the court while lord judge recounted the ordeal of a convenience shop owner , who was beaten up in front of his wife and and saw his business ransacked			1
when the couple tried to escape in their van , they were both pulled out of the vehicle and a knife was held to his stomach			0
lord judge said the man had moved into @entity5 to make a fresh start and build a new life in the community , and that was beginning to happen before the riots			2
but what had happened had affected him more than he ever thought possible , so he had pulled out of the business and was now unemployed and in great financial difficulty			0
this offence on its own was of the ‘ greatest possible seriousness ’ , he added			0
@entity1 , who used a brick , a wooden and a metal pole , a hammer and a waste bin as weapons , had pleaded guilty in the context of his identification on @entity153 footage and from blood found on the cash machine			2
wrecked : @entity5 saw some of the fiercest violence and disorder during the @entity71 riots , with an entire row of shops and buildings on @entity163 , @entity5 , gutted after widespread looting and arson the judges went on to dismiss an appeal against a five - and - a - half - year prison sentence imposed on 23 - year - old @entity169 for offences of arson , burglary and violent disorder in the riots in @entity175 on august 9 last year			1
@entity169 , of @entity176 , @entity175 , was part of mob violence which left 49 police officers injured and resulted in a @entity181 @entity175 van being torched in @entity182 , causing £ 60,000 damage			0
confronted with @entity153 footage , he admitted his guilt and expressed disgust at what he had done			0
rejecting the appeal , mr @entity30 said the sentence handed down at @entity189 in january was severe , as intended to be , but not manifestly excessive			0
blaze : while @entity1 led a rampage through @entity5 , emergency services found themselves overstretched by the scale of the disorder			1

@entity1 , 20 , led an orgy of violence and criminality including hijacking , burglary , looting , mugging over a few hours in @entity5
@entity203 's top judge extends his jail term from just 48 months in a young offender institution to seven years in prison
