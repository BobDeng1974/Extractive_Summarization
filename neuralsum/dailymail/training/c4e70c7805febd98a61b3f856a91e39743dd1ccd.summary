by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale sir @entity1 , @entity2 ’s greatest all - round cricketer , was conspicuous in his lack of visible support for cricket ’s big charity day at @entity7			1
@entity8 , which supports the game ’s major charities — @entity11 , chance to shine and the @entity14 benevolent fund — dressed @entity7 in light blue on saturday to promote the causes			1
but @entity1 , who ironically was knighted mainly for his huge contribution in raising money for charity , was the one regular @entity20 commentator on screen not wearing a light blue tie on the day			1
@entity8 gave ties the day before to @entity20 cricket producer @entity24 for his commentary team to wear			1
but @entity1 preferred to sport the colours of @entity27 , the @entity28 team for whom he made 11 appearances			1
charity figure : sir @entity1 , right , pictured in december with @entity32 , chose to wear a tie with colours supporting football team @entity27 at @entity7 on saturday , rather than one for @entity8 meanwhile , @entity36 motorcycle firm @entity35 were the only company with a perimeter advertising board at @entity38 who did not change to a light blue colour on saturday			1
a @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ we had a tie for sir @entity1 but it ’s entirely up to him whether he chooses to wear it on screen and we were very grateful when he did so last year			1
as for @entity35 , they gave us no reason why they did n’t want the change			2
’ the row simmers on between senior rabbi @entity51 and @entity53 chairman @entity52 as to who said what about @entity2 all - rounder @entity55 wearing ‘ @entity59 ’ and ‘ @entity61 ’ wristbands during the third test against @entity58			1
rabbi @entity51 remains furious with @entity52 ’s version of their conversation — claiming he never threatened to resign from the @entity65			2
he also berated @entity52 , a fluent @entity66 speaker who went to university in @entity68 , for politicising the issue by criticising @entity71 ’s prime minister @entity70			0
@entity51 said : ‘ @entity52 has forfeited any credibility as an unbiased chairman of the @entity53 by portraying his political prejudices			0
’ @entity52 said : ‘ there are two sides to every ghastly story and rabbi @entity51 launched a tirade at me about @entity59			0
it was a humanitarian gesture by @entity80 that has been sensitively handled , with the players themselves voting not to publicise political messages on the pitch and that should be the end of the matter			0
’ simmering row : @entity53 chairman @entity52 , left , and rabbi @entity51 disagree over who said what online giants @entity90 and @entity91 are both showing interest in covering the live international cricket that has been put out to tender by the @entity94			2
@entity97 cricket ’s ruling body have controversially split the live rights for the 50 - over @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 between television and digital in the next contract , starting in 2015			2
this would mean a far greater viewing reach for the sport , especially in @entity58 and @entity108			0
but the strategy has upset both @entity110 and @entity20 , who wanted the opportunity to bid for both rights and not have exclusivity diluted by worldwide online availability			0
star : @entity91 and @entity90 are interested in covering international games with players like @entity119 in demand it will certainly affect the @entity122 tv companies ’ bids for the competitions and the money that trickles down to the @entity127 counties as a result of the revamped @entity94 governance			2
the @entity53 ’s attempts to promote women ’s cricket have not been helped by @entity133 ’s hosting of a @entity101 double - header			1
@entity2 men play @entity58 on september 7 on the final day of their dismal tour , after the @entity2 women ’s team have taken on @entity139			1
yet the women ’s match has not been mentioned on the tickets			0
@entity143 blame the omission on uncertainty about the opponents , although the @entity53 say the women ’s match was first discussed in february			0
explanation : friends of @entity150 say his slurred commentary during @entity153 's win against @entity154 was due to medicine he takes to help him fight ulcerative colitis and depression @entity150 's slurred speech during his co-commentary stint for @entity160 on @entity153 ’s late win against @entity154 sparked social media claims that the former @entity2 star was the worse for wear			2
@entity150 , following previous allegations about his drink troubles , revealed in @entity167 last february that he was fighting ulcerative colitis and bouts of depression			0
and it is the medicines he takes to combat those serious ailments that make him slur his words			0
friends say that was the problem @entity150 had to contend with at the @entity177 .			0

@entity2 's greatest all - round cricketer sported the colours of his former football club @entity27 rather than those of @entity8
saturday at the @entity7 was cricket 's big charity day , as *people* dressed in light blue to promote the game 's major charities
@entity1 was knighted mainly for contribution to raising money for charity
