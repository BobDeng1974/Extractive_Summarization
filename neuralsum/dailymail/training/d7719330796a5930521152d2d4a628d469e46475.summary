but the @entity10 's head of communications admitted that he inflated the figures by ten times the real amount because only 3,409 people had bothered to vote but the association has now admitted that its head of communications did indeed inflate the figures by ten times because hardly anyone actually bothered to vote			1

@entity49 , head of communications at @entity10 until friday morning , admitted that he was the one who fiddled the figures by ten times the real amount because only 3,409 people had voted			1
' we 're very sorry ' : @entity10 's chief @entity53 , personally humiliated himself after he initially scolded media for reporting doubts about @entity10 's vote - counting , apologised today his confession came after prolonged rumours of vote fixing that were hitherto vigorously denied by the club			1
shortly after being made to walk the plank on friday @entity62 said candidly : ' i ’ve messed up and cooked the numbers			0
' his boss , head of @entity10 @entity53 who fired him , has ordered a full investigation			1
it lays @entity10 wide open to claims of kickbacks from car firms to promote their vehicles and a nasty suspicion that the whole competition has been a total fix for the decade it has been running			2
' we 've got our work cut out for us to repair the tarnished reputation , ' said @entity10 managing director @entity53 , who called @entity49 's actions ' an inexcusable mistake '			2
' we 're very sorry , ' added @entity53 , personally humiliated himself after he initially scolded media for reporting doubts about @entity10 's vote - counting			2

' i cooked it up ' : in 2012 the @entity105 ( pictured ) received the coveted ' @entity107 angel - accolade with 330,000 votes - a figure dreamed up in @entity49 's imagination as @entity10 now believes just 76,000 votes were actually cast another scandal : it is a nightmare reminiscent of 2005 when @entity10 was forced to admit fixing a test on the @entity115 - built budget car the @entity116 when it put out a press release saying the car 's wheels were dodgy ( pictured : 2012 's @entity120 ) ‘ credibility and trust are our key commodity , ' said @entity125 , adding that @entity10 would be apologizing to car producers			1

the @entity141 received a tip off from a whistleblower that in fact the wheels were purposefully damaged prior to the test to make it perform badly			0
@entity49 was also editor - in - chief of car industry magazine @entity146 and he has lost that post too			0
in the land where car is king and top marques like @entity154 , @entity133 and @entity132 fill the nation ’s driveways and autobahns , the fixing of the competition is front page news			0
@entity154 , eager to distance itself from any part in the manipulation , has demanded ‘ clarification ’ about what went on			0
