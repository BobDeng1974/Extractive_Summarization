speaking about the abortion scandal , @entity1 , @entity3 mp for @entity4 and @entity5 , said : ' it 's a mockery ' dozens of doctors found to be signing off abortions for women they had never met will not face any disciplinary action , it was revealed yesterday			1
the 67 doctors were identified in an investigation by @entity16 watchdog the @entity15 as having illegally signed blank abortion forms , which should be filled in only once they have a thorough understanding of a woman 's circumstances			1
one of the doctors had signed so many blank forms that they were still being used by the abortion clinic four years after he left			1
all 67 were referred to the @entity25 but a @entity27 request has now established that none of them will be brought before a fitness to practise hearing , where they could be disciplined , suspended , or struck off			1
the @entity25 has also refused to pass the names to the police , even though the offence can merit a jail sentence			0
@entity37 say the figures are evidence of a society where ' abortion is on demand ' and have accused watchdogs of covering up the crimes of doctors who remain free to practise			1
by law , a woman can have an abortion only if two doctors sign a form having agreed that continuing the pregnancy could cause her physical or emotional harm			2
the government advises that at least one doctor has seen the woman – and at the very least , they should have thoroughly read her medical notes or spoken to her on the phone			0
but the @entity15 found that at least 67 doctors working at private and @entity16 clinics had pre-signed abortion forms without even knowing the names of the women they would be used for			1
@entity1 , @entity3 mp for @entity4 and @entity5 , said : ' this is clear evidence of the abortion - on - demand culture throughout the medical establishment			0
' sixty - seven doctors happily referred for abortions without knowing a single thing about the woman requesting them			0
worse , at the very top , senior doctors and lawyers at the @entity25 decided to keep these crimes to themselves			0
this shames the @entity25 and makes a mockery of the @entity77			0
' @entity78 , the @entity79 mp for @entity80 and parliamentary chairman of the @entity82 , said : ' there is something frightening about this			0
by law , a woman can have an abortion only if two doctors sign a form having agreed that continuing the pregnancy could cause her physical or emotional harm ( stock picture ) abortions can legally be performed under certain conditions			2
the first is that continuing with the pregnancy involves a greater risk to the physical or mental health of the woman , or her existing children , than having a termination			0
the woman 's ' actual or reasonably foreseeable future environment ' may be taken into account			0
a non-emergency abortion must be agreed by two doctors – or one in an emergency – and carried out by a doctor in a government - approved hospital or clinic			2
the two doctors who give their consent must work for either an @entity16 clinic or gp surgery , or at a private provider affiliated to the @entity113 , such as @entity114 or @entity115 , the @entity115			1
staff also have a duty to provide impartial and objective counselling			0
in september 2011 , mps rejected an attempt by @entity79 mp @entity122 to stop abortion providers giving @entity16 - funded counselling to women			1
' it says something about how sinister and unaccountable abortion practice in the @entity129 has become that such a large number of doctors could brazenly break the law and the most senior medical establishment in the land omit to refer their crimes to the police			2
' the @entity15 carried out spot checks on 250 private and @entity16 abortion clinics in 2012 after it emerged that some doctors had been letting women terminate their pregnancies simply because the foetus was the ' wrong ' sex			1
an undercover investigation for the @entity145 filmed consultant @entity146 , who worked for both private clinics and @entity16 hospitals in @entity149 , telling a woman : ' i do n't ask questions			1
if you want a termination , you want a termination			0
' dr @entity156 , who worked at the private @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity159 , was also filmed agreeing to conduct the procedure even though he told the woman : ' it 's like female infanticide , is n't it ? ' both doctors are being investigated by the @entity25 , although they will not face criminal charges because the @entity167 said it would not be in the public interest			0
the @entity15 said that during the course of its investigations its inspectors had found piles of pre-signed forms at some clinics			1
one was still using forms signed by a doctor who had left four years before			2
the @entity178 used @entity27 requests to obtain figures from the @entity25 on the numbers of doctors referred to them for pre-signing forms following the @entity15 investigation			1
but the @entity25 refused to reveal the names of any of the doctors or give details about their exact job titles or where they practise			2
professor @entity189 , chairman of @entity190 , the pro-life pregnancy counselling charity , said : ' i think it is utterly disgraceful that the @entity25 has n't pursued these doctors			0
' how can anyone say that they are acting in “ good faith ” when they sign , in advance , forms authorising a serious medical intervention ? ' @entity202 , a @entity3 peer , said : ' whatever one 's position on abortion , for or against , we can all agree on one simple principle : the law passed by @entity210 should be enforced			2
