@entity0 may have introduced a no - swearing protocol , but @entity3 manager @entity2 must surely have had a few expletives running through his mind , if not passing his lips , as his side twice squandered the lead in their top - of - the - table draw			1
@entity3 dropped to second and @entity0 third as both sides missed the chance to move three points clear - allowing @entity15 to go top with a 2 - 1 win at @entity18 - as @entity19 cancelled out @entity21 ’s opener and @entity22 equalised after @entity23 sent the home side ahead again			1
@entity0 manager @entity25 wants his players and staff to stop swearing to concentrate them in matches , but in one so frenetic that is no mean feat. @entity22 fires home emphatically from close range to ensure a share of the spoils for @entity0 the experienced striker wheels away in celebration after scoring his fourth goal since joining the @entity37 @entity21 fired home from close range to give @entity3 the lead after 12 minutes @entity3 : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity21 ( @entity45 93 ) , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity49 77 ) , @entity50 ( @entity51 77 ) , @entity23			1

goals scored : @entity19 30 , @entity22 68 referee : @entity76 att : 11,031 did they manage to maintain it during this one ? ’ if you heard me at half - time , no , ’ @entity25 revealed afterwards			1
this was a proper top versus second match			0
one between a clash of philosophies ; arguably the league ’s most attractive yet stringent side , @entity3 , and the big names and spending might of @entity0			0
the south coast club were hosting in their 12,000 capacity @entity93 ground			0
if the game were at @entity0 ’s @entity97 it would ’ve been full to it ’s 33,000 maximum			0
pure football struck first when the home side took the lead in only the 12th minute with a wonderfully constructed move			2
@entity50 cushioned a cross from @entity23 into the path of @entity21 and the midfielder took a touch before finishing from eight yards out			2
the winger celebrates after giving the @entity107 the lead against their promotion rivals @entity19 hit a precise left - footed drive to get @entity0 back on level terms on the half - hour mark the 23 - year - old - on loan from @entity116 outfit @entity115 - wheels away in celebration after making it 1 - 1 @entity2 was priced out of a january move for @entity121 ’s exciting winger @entity120 despite five bids and they signed no one to reinforce their promotion push			1
conversely , @entity0 shelled out on loan moves for @entity22 from @entity128 and @entity115 ’s @entity19 and it was those two who combined for their equaliser after half - an - hour			2
@entity22 , who came on in the 15th minute when top - scorer @entity67 hobbled off , did well down the right flank and passed to @entity19			1
with blistering pace he beat a man before burying a left - footed shot into the bottom right corner			0
but the home side scored a minute before the break , when top - scorer @entity23 fired into the top left corner from a tight angle on the right			1
@entity2 broke the bank - in @entity3 terms - to sign @entity23 for a club record £ 3million from @entity144 last summer			2
that goal was the 22 - year - old ’s 18th of the season in all competitions			0
but @entity0 were able to call on £ 65,000 - per - week @entity22 , who has commanded almost £ 50m in transfer fees during his career , to fire them level from close range in the 68th minute			1
@entity23 's right - footed shot put @entity3 back in front just before half - time the @entity107 top scorer ( second right ) celebrates scoring his 18th goal of the season @entity2 said : ’ for me names of other teams do n't scare me in the sense of where they ’ve been or the sides they ’ve played for			1
i would back my players to go toe - to - toe with anyone			0
we ’re where we are on right			0
’ @entity22 had a half - volley saved at the near post by @entity40 , who also fumbled but kept out @entity64 ’ effort and @entity23 twice went close in the first half			2
@entity25 and his players would n’t like to admit it out loud , but what an eff - ing game .			0

@entity21 gave the hosts the lead after just 12 minutes
@entity19 scored his third goal in just two games to level proceedings
@entity107 top scorer @entity23 put the @entity107 back ahead
but @entity22 's emphatic close - range finish drew the @entity37 level
as a result of the draw both sides move down a place in the table , with @entity15 taking top spot in the *championship*
