@entity0 has told a series of whoppers about her family history in order to appear more sympathetic to immigrants ' - rights activists , according to documents that surfaced online wednesday			2
@entity7 found @entity9 records and @entity11 documents – draft cards – that establish that three of the former secretary of state 's grandparents were born in @entity16			1
that clashes with what @entity18 herself has claimed publicly , including wednesday afternoon in @entity21 , @entity22			1
he started there when he was a teenager and just kept going			0
' @entity18 made the statment to underscore her support for changing the status of milions of illegal immigrants			1
' we are turning down people who really want to work , ' she said			0
' i mean , they are here to work			0
and a lot of them now have children who are @entity16 citizens , and they are doing the best they can to try to make a good life for themselves and their families			2
' the underpinnings of her personal story , however , seem false			0
staging : most reporters were kept out of the @entity67 company ' for space reasons ' although the warehouse had plenty of room to go around both of @entity18 ’s maternal grandparents , named @entity74 and @entity75 , were born in @entity76 , according to @entity7 's records research			1
and while her paternal grandfather , @entity79 , immigrated to the @entity16 , his wife @entity78 was born in @entity43			1
in a speech last year in @entity81 , @entity18 claimed @entity78 ' immigrated with her family as a young girl to @entity42 [ @entity84 ] and went to work , very young , in a silk mill. ' ' she traced her @entity86 back to the @entity88 brothers themselves , ' @entity18 said , ' who converted her great grandparents in the small coal mining villages of @entity93			1
' the @entity18 camp quickly acknowledged the accurate @entity78 family history			0
' as has been correctly pointed out , ' a campaign spokesperson told @entity7 , ' while her grandfather was an immigrant , it appears that @entity0 ’s grandmother was born shortly after her parents and siblings arrived in the @entity16 in the early 1880s			2
' but the insider insisted that mrs. @entity0 had simply believed what her family members had told her			0
' her grandparents always spoke about the immigrant experience and , as a result she has always thought of them as immigrants , ' the spokesperson said .			0

@entity18 claimed wednesday in @entity22 that ' all my grandparents came over here ' as immigrants
she said last year that one of her grandmothers immigrated to @entity43 and worked in a silk mill
but @entity7 found @entity16 @entity9 records showing that only one @entity18 grandfather , *adn* neither of their wives , was born outside the @entity16
@entity18 apparently *shaded* the truth to seem more *authentic* with her argument that illegal immigrants should have more legal access to jobs
