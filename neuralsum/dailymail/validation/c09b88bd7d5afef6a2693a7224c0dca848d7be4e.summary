with their silver hair and kind smiles , @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 look like three normal grandmothers , enjoying a quiet drink and a chat			1
but their innocent looks bely a wilder reality and when the trio , who are aged between 61 and 64 , travel abroad on one of their regular grannies ’ trips , all thoughts of a quiet life are left behind			2
instead of enjoying quiet days out with their grandchildren , fancy dress , colourful cocktails and @entity23 party spots are the order of the day for the three @entity26 pensioners			0
now the trio are to appear on a new documentary called oaps behaving badly , a @entity45 series that follows the nation ’s craziest pensioners			1
the trio 's party plans swung into action as soon as they retired , with @entity0 and @entity1 joining june in @entity54 for a huge party to mark her retirement			1
the riotous trip to the @entity23 holiday island included nights out wearing comedy wigs and boobs , plastic penis noses , and flirtations with much younger male holidaymakers			0
innocent : june , seen here in an everyday ensemble , likes to zip between bars on her mobility scooter getting ready : although the trio like to go out in @entity26 , they save their biggest parties for holidays unusual look : @entity0 ( far right ) says she wore a prostitute 's outfit for her son 's 40th birthday party ' on holiday no man is ever safe because i can guarantee i always feel somebody ’s bottom or something else , ' explained @entity0 , a grandmother of three			1
; my behaviour is a bit erotic sometimes			0
if i ’ve had a drink especially			0
' but husband @entity89 , 67 , does n’t mind being left behind or his wife ’s flirty behaviour and indulges in several solo weeks in @entity23 himself			0
according to @entity0 , ‘ what happens in @entity54 , stay in @entity54 ’ , with all three ladies happy to make the most of their time abroad			1
' when i went to @entity54 for my son ’s 40th i got dressed up as a hooker , ' reveals @entity0 , admitting she got into trouble with a local woman , who thought she was a rival escort invading her patch			1
leading the charge : @entity0 is the ringleader and says ' no man is safe ' when she is out and about propping up the bar : the trio have long been fans of wild all - night parties apologies : june says the trio often have to apologise when they return to bars following a booze - fuelled night just as excitable is june who rides a mobility scooter as a result of having had 10 leg operations			1
not that she has any plans to slow down			0
' when she gets on that scooter , you ’ve got to watch out because you ’re never safe , ' says @entity0			2
' she can be a tearaway when she gets speeding on that scooter			0
' but despite her tearaway nickname , june says @entity0 is the wildest of the group			2
' once we ’ve been somewhere , we ’re never forgotten			0
' we go back for the second time and we have to apologise for what @entity0 ’s done the first time			2

@entity0 , 64 , is one of a new breed of partying grandmothers
