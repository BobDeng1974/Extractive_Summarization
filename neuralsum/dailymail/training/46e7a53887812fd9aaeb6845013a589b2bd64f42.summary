the @entity2 scientists , at @entity3 , are now homing in on radio signals from worlds found by the telescope , and ' objects of interest ' which might or might not be worlds			1
they are already sifting through ' hits ' - points of electromagnetic energy that look like potential transmissions from alien worlds			2
early this year , they will move their search on to the terabytes of signals from the @entity7 radio telescope - and they already know what to look for			1
' we 've started searching our @entity2 observations and our analyses have generated a few ' hits , '' say the @entity3 scientists			2
' but all are undoubtedly examples of terrestrial radio frequency interference			0
' the scientists look to see if signals are ' duplicated ' elsewhere in the sky - a clear sign that they are caused by interference			0
so far , all the ' hits ' that the scientists have unearthed have been ' false positives '			0
the @entity14 has homed in its search for alien life on the few alien worlds we know to exist - using data from @entity8 's world - hunting @entity7 telescope project but a ' real ' transmission would not look that different			1
the scientists are hunting for signals of ' narrow ' frequency - space phenomena tend to produce relatively ' broad ' signals			0
' even though these signals are interference , detecting events with similar characteristics to what we expect from @entity70 is a good indication that the first steps of our detection algorithms are working properly , ' say the scientists			0
artist 's concept of the @entity79 planetary system : ' we 'll apply our algorithms to all our observations of @entity7 planets , ' say the @entity3 scientists			0
' during the coming weeks , we 'll be posting more of our results as we process the nearly 50 terabytes of data we collected in early 2011 ' having ' tested ' their algorithms , the scientists now aim to sift through a huge amount of @entity7 data			1

@entity8 's @entity7 telescope has found dozens of ' known ' worlds
@entity2 scientists now scanning @entity7 worlds for signals
sifting first ' hits ' - and now know what to look for
will scan 50 terabytes of data early this year
