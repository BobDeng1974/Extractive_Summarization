all week criticism has been raining down on them			1
from being likened to the @entity2 , to being told they are rudderless , to warnings about the manager ’s job			2
tumbling out of the @entity7 at such an early stage causes a maelstrom at @entity10 and plenty — from @entity12 to a raft of former @entity15 players — have had something to say about how poorly @entity17 and his side have performed this season			1
so when the topic of criticism is raised with @entity23 , there is a wry smile			2
@entity15 ’s vice-captain has not shut himself away from the disparaging comments but he did n’t need to hear them			2
that is why he does not shirk the issue as this particular conversation unfolds at @entity31			0
@entity23 ( left ) wheels away in celebration with @entity34 after the latter scored a free - kick despite @entity34 's goal , @entity15 crashed out of the @entity7 , continuing their poor campaign the @entity40 table , showing @entity41 in third and @entity15 ninth ‘ you ’ve got to take ( the @entity47 comment ) as a bit tongue in cheek , ’ said @entity23 , gearing up for sunday ’s trip to @entity44			1
‘ ( @entity12 ) has said it as a joke			0
he does n’t think either team is playing really well at the minute but that does n’t bother us			0
‘ we know we are not playing well			0
we know we need to be doing better and i ’m sure @entity41 feel the same			0
’ @entity23 has developed a strong relationship with @entity17			1
the @entity57 midfielder refers to his manager as being ‘ one of the best in the world ’ and has made no secret of how big an influence he had in reviving a @entity15 career that , at one stage , never looked like coming into bloom			2
it is significant , then , to hear @entity23 ’s appraisal of @entity17 ’ mood and methods following tuesday ’s disappointment against @entity72			1
‘ he ’s still confident in the way he wants to play football and is doing everything he can for us to start getting results , ’ he said			0
‘ the outside world might accept that ( it ’s all down to the manager ) but as players we certainly do n’t accept it			0
we ’ve got full confidence in the manager			1
’ despite their poor form , @entity23 is confident @entity17 ( pictured ) can guide them to a win the @entity15 players were in high spirits as they trained ahead of their game against @entity41 aware that victory at @entity44 would dramatically alter the mood around @entity10 , @entity23 is quick to think back to how it was in march when @entity15 made the short trip down the @entity96 and terrorised @entity98 ’ team			1
the score that day was 3 - 0 but it could have been doubled such was @entity15 ’s superiority ; nine months on , @entity23 does not accept @entity41 are now the better team , nor does he entertain the idea that sunday will see @entity105 ’s side exact revenge			1
‘ we ’ve got enough quality and character in this group to win on sunday and the next game as well and then build from that , ’ said @entity23 , who has put contract talks to the back of his mind until @entity15 ’s results improve			1
@entity34 scored two penalties in @entity15 's comprehensive 3 - 0 win at their fierce rivals last season @entity34 has scored more goals as an away player at @entity44 than anyone else in @entity40 history ‘ although @entity41 have been picking up some good results of late and showing some great resilience , i do n’t think they ’ve played fantastically well			1
are they a better team than us ? no. i see the quality and character that we ’ve got at this club every day in training			0
‘ but it ’s all well and good me sitting here and saying that but it ’s up to us to go and do the business			0
‘ i ’m not saying @entity41 are n’t a good team because they are and they ’ve got fantastic players but so have we			2
so we ’ve got to go there and do it			0

@entity15 have received heavy criticism over the last week
they have been likened to a *pub* team , and told they are rudderless
@entity23 says @entity15 are not bothered by the comments
the midfielder says they have full confidence in @entity17
he thinks @entity15 have enough quality to beat @entity41 on sunday
