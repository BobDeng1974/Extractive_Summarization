' the explosion was so powerful and loud that i could not hear anything for ten minutes , ' said @entity94 , a teacher waiting at a bus stop			0
' it was early and there was n't much traffic			0
' the bombing came a day after hundreds of @entity9 burned cars and threw rocks at a @entity103 military base in the capital in a demonstration against the anti-islam film			0

proximity : the bomb blast happened near @entity5 airport , killing nine and injuring eight others ( file picture ) @entity14 is led by former warlord @entity115			1

@entity14 is a radical @entity15 militia that has thousands of fighters and followers across the north and east of @entity9			0
its 65 - year - old leader is a former @entity9 prime minister and one - time @entity103 ally who is now listed as a terrorist by @entity132			0

at least nine other people were killed			2
the news will raise fears that anger over the film will feed into deteriorating security as the @entity103 and other @entity181 countries try to protect their forces from a rash of so - called insider attacks by @entity9 colleagues			0
the @entity103 has sent ships , extra troops and special forces to protect @entity103 interests and citizens in the @entity172 , while a number of its embassies have evacuated staff and are on high alert for trouble			0
despite @entity199 's efforts early in his tenure to improve relations with the @entity203 and @entity204 world , the violence adds to a host of problems including the continued @entity103 military involvement in @entity9 , @entity209 's nuclear programme , the @entity211 civil war and the fall - out from the @entity214 revolts			0
