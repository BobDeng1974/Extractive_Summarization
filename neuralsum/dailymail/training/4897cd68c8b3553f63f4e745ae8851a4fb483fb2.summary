by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 07:41 est , 21 november 2012 a grandmother has found a way to avoid shelling out for expensive skin creams - by letting live snails slide all over her face			1
@entity6 , 62 , said she has maintained her youthful looks by allowing the slimy molluscs to slither across her skin for at least 15 minutes every week			1
the grandmother came up with the idea after seeing adverts for luxury facial creams featuring the garden creature 's ooze			1
these amazing pictures show her enjoying the unique beauty therapy treatment at her home in @entity31 , @entity19			0
ms @entity6 told @entity19 ’s @entity33 newspaper she believed the bizarre ritual had helped her keep her looks			1
she said : ' i just let the snails crawl over my face , my neck and my hands			1
' once a woman reaches a certain age you need to look after your skin , and this costs me nothing			2
' ms @entity6 told the @entity33 she started using snails as part of her beauty therapy two years ago after spotting a television advert for an anti-acne cream imported from @entity52			1
ms @entity6 says her garden snails can last up to weeks once caught and kept in bags she now regularly goes hunting in her own garden and those of friends and neighbours for the slimey creatures , which she keeps in a bag in her bedroom			1
ms @entity6 lets the snails out at least once a week to slide across her face , neck and hands			1
she sits back and stays still as the creatures leave a trail of mucus on her skin			1
she then just needs a quick wash with cold water before her beauty routine is complete			0
the grandmother said the home - made therapy was just as good as expensive creams			2
she said : ' i ca n’t afford the expensive cream made from snails in @entity52			2
that ’s when i started collecting the snails and using them			2
' she added : ' i have my snails right here , i keep them for weeks in this packet and i do n’t even need to feed them			0
' @entity87 said many of her friends had been stunned when they found out about her bizarre beauty routine			0
but she said some had started using snail therapy themselves after seeing the results			0
she added : ' i told a friend in @entity98 to try it out and she called me a few weeks later to say it does work			0
' however ms @entity6 ’s idea has not gone down well with all members of her family			1
her brother @entity106 told the @entity33 he hated seeing snails sliding over his sister			0
he said : ' i ca n’t watch when she does this - it ’s too creepy			0
' snail extract has become a key ingredient in expensive skin creams snail slime has recently been heralded by cosmetic firms as a useful beauty ingredient			2
several upmarket facial creams now include the shelled slug ’s mucus			1
those who apply the cream are told the slime can help reduce wrinkles , clear up acne and reduce pigmentation and scarring			0
but commercial creams can prove costly for those wanting to try the healing power of the snail			0
a 130 ml tube of cream containing snail slime was being sold by @entity134 for $ 33.99			0
meanwhile a 30ml jar of cream made from 85 percent snail slime was on offer from the beauty firm @entity139 for $ 64.99 .			0
