a 90 - year - old woman who shattered her pelvis in a fall was forced to wait six hours for an ambulance to take her to hospital			1
@entity5 , who lives alone , was found lying face down by her neighbour crying in agony			1
after the alarm was raised at 5.45pm on august 29 , guidelines stipulate an ambulance should have taken mrs @entity5 to hospital within 90 minutes			1
but the widow , who said she feels she was treated like a ' dog ' , did not arrive at the @entity15 and @entity16 until after midnight			1
' i do n't think you would have treated a dog like that			1
' the former ward sister at @entity32 , @entity15 , added : ' i have never suffered so much pain in my life			2
' i will never forget it			0
' her neighbour @entity36 , 68 , rushed to help after the 90 - year - old pressed an emergency help - line button			2
but it was more than two hours before a rapid response paramedic arrived and more than six before mrs @entity5 was taken to ambulance by a crew			1
mrs @entity36 said she repeatedly called to find out if an ambulance had been sent			2
a paramedic finally turned up after 8pm in a rapid response vehicle			1
' the paramedic told us that if an ambulance had not arrived by 11pm we should phone 999 , ' said mrs @entity36			1
but with no ambulance she rang again at 11.15pm			0
' again it was confirmed that an ambulance was on its way coming from a very long way away but without blue lights , ' said mrs @entity36			2
it was 12.15am before an ambulance arrived , by which time mrs @entity5 had been lifted into her bed			1
mrs @entity5 added : ' i never want to go through that again			1
' i could n't move because of the pain in my leg and i knew i had fractured it			1
' the former nurse said she feels she was treated like a ' dog '			1
she said : ' i never want to go through that again			0
i could n't move because of the pain in my leg ' @entity16 - born mrs @entity5 trained at the @entity15 and @entity16 before starting her career as a nurse in 1948			1
she moved into her current home in 1980 , her husband @entity70 died four years later and she has lived by herself ever since			0
' one of the biggest fears i have is falling over , ' said mrs @entity5			1
an @entity73 spokesman said mrs @entity5 had been conscious and breathing so the incident was graded as a ' green call ' as it was not life - threatening			1
@entity77 , senior locality manager for the ambulance service , said : ' i 'd like to apologise to the patient for waiting as long as she did to be taken to hospital			2
' a paramedic attended her two hours after the call but an ambulance crew was not available to visit her until much later			2
' i am heartened that she was pleased with the level of care given when we attended			0
' we are looking at this patient 's case and will visit her to discuss what happened			0
' we 're working hard to get more ambulances on the road , recruit hundreds of new frontline staff , upskill staff , and save money to reinvest and improve patient care so that patients get a quicker response and a level of service they expect			0
' health minister and @entity15 mp @entity102 said : ' the impression i get is there has been a reduction in the horror stories , but this case demonstrates there is still a long way to go			2
' there are still failings , which are unacceptable and i think renewing the ambulance fleet and recruiting hundreds of student paramedics will bear fruit			0
' but it will take time			0
' between april and august this year , there were 164 instances in north @entity15 where response times to non-life - threatening patients were breached			1
this was just under 4 per cent of all calls			0
ambulance services across the @entity124 categorise each call according to how serious the patient 's condition is			0
the aim is to ensure the most serious , life - threatening calls are dealt with first			0
the categories are nationally agreed , by the @entity131 and each ambulance service across the @entity124 are measured according to required targets			0
- @entity134 the most serious category , @entity136 is reserved for those patients who have suffered traumatic life - threatening injuries or those who are displaying the signs of suffering a heart attack or cardiac arrest			0
an ambulance is expected to reach a patient within eight minutes			2
where possible two ambulance crews are dispatched to @entity134 calls - commonly a rapid response car , who can make initial assessments and start to treat the patient at the scene , followed by an ambulance , who can transport the patient to hospital			1
ambulance services across the @entity124 categorise each 999 call according to how serious the patient 's condition is			2
the aim is to ensure the most life - threatening calls are dealt with first - @entity162 the second most serious category is for all other life - threatening emergencies			0
examples include patients who have suffered a stroke , with serious symptoms or those who are struggling to breathe			0
similarly to @entity134 ambulance crews are expected to reach the patient within eight minutes of the 999 call being logged			2
for both @entity173 calls the response times are set out as national requirements rather than recommended times			1
the guidelines dictate that an emergency response - usually in the form of a rapid response car - will reach 75 per cent of these calls within eight minutes			1
where onward transport to hospital is required , 95 per cent of life - threatening calls will receive an ambulance capable of transporting the patient within 19 minutes of the request being made			1
- @entity188 1 these are serious but not life - threatening calls , for example diabetic problems or a suspected stroke with no serious symptoms			0
a @entity188 1 call requires an emergency response within 20 minutes			2
- @entity188 2 also deemed serious but not life - threatening , @entity188 2 calls can include suspected fractured arms or legs , or a patient who has fallen and maybe immobile			0
these calls require an emergency crew to be on the scene within 30 minutes			0
- @entity203 these are non-emergency calls which require an on - scene response within 60 minutes or an assessment over the phone from the clinical support desk within 20 minutes			0
a patient who has suffered a suspected overdose , but is showing no serious symptoms , or someone who has suffered a non serious injury would be classified as a @entity203 call			0
- @entity188 4 these are the least serious calls , which require emergency crews to be sent to the scene within 90 minutes or a telephone assessment within an hour			1
@entity219 , a fall with no apparent injuries or someone in pain , but showing no serious symptoms would be classed as a @entity188 4 999 call			0
response times for @entity188 calls are recommended and are set locally rather than being national requirements .			1
