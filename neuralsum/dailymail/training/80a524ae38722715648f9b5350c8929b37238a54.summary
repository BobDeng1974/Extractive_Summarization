@entity1 's bold plan to land a robotic spaceship on the moon and bring it back to @entity4 has moved another step forward			1
the service module of @entity1 's unmanned test lunar orbiter successfully entered an eight - hour orbit around the moon , state media reported			1
this brings it within 125 miles ( 200 km ) of the lunar surface at its closest point , and out to a range of 3,293 miles ( 5,300 km ) at its highest point			0
the craft , loaded with support systems for operating a spaceship , will collect further data to aid planning of the 2017 chang'e 5 mission , state broadcaster @entity29 said			1
chang'e 5 is being designed to make a soft landing on the moon and collect at least 4lbs ( 2kg ) of rock and soil samples before returning to @entity4			1
if successful , that would make @entity1 only the third country after the @entity44 and @entity45 to meet such a challenge			2

chang'e 5 is being designed to make a soft landing on the moon and collect at least 4lbs ( 2kg ) of rock and soil samples before returning to @entity4 @entity1 is also looking to mine the moon for the rare helium isotope that some scientists claim could meet global energy demand far into the future , according to a report in @entity59			1
the lunar dirt brought back by mankind 's first moonwalkers contained an abundance of titanium , platinum and other valuable minerals			0
but our satellite also contains a substance that could be of even greater use to civilisation – one that could revolutionise energy production			0
it 's called helium 3 and has been dumped on the moon in vast quantities by solar winds			0
now @entity1 is looking to mine the moon for the rare helium isotope that some scientists claim could meet global energy demand far into the future , according to a report in @entity59			1
professor @entity82 , the chief scientist of the @entity83 , recently said , the moon is ' so rich ' in helium 3 , that this could ' solve humanity 's energy demand for around 10,000 years at least			1

@entity90 , scientists argue , could power clean fusion plants			0
it is nonradioactive and a very little goes a very long way			0
for instance , two fully - loaded @entity95 cargo bay ’s worth - about 40 tonnes worth - could power the @entity44 for a year at the current rate of energy consumption			0
this would require mining an areas the size of @entity102 the isotope is so rare on the @entity4 because our atmosphere and magnetic field prevent any of the solar helium 3 from arriving on the surface			2
the moon does n't have this problem as there is nothing to prevent helium 3 being absorbed by the lunar soil			2
@entity1 's lunar exploration program has already launched a pair of orbiting lunar probes , and in 2013 landed a craft on the moon with a rover onboard			1
none of those were designed to return to @entity4			0
@entity1 also has hinted at a possible crewed mission to the moon			0
@entity1 sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 , the only other country after @entity45 and the @entity44 to achieve manned space travel independently			0
it also has launched a temporarily crewed space station			0
@entity1 's program has received @entity45 assistance , but has largely developed independently of @entity44 's , which is now in its sixth decade of putting people into space			2

feat achieved by service module of @entity1 's unmanned test lunar orbiter
it is now in an eight - hour orbit around the moon , state media reported
the craft will collect data to aid planning of the 2017 @entity143 mission
