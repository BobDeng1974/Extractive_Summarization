@entity1 wildlife officials are preparing to release @entity3 's largest land mammal into its native @entity5 habitat for the first time in more than a century			1
the @entity7 plans to begin moving wood bison , which can weigh up to 2,000 pounds and stand six - feet - tall at the shoulder , from a conservation center near @entity11 to the village of @entity13			1
a hundred wood bison will be released into the @entity15 about 350 miles southwest of @entity16 in a few weeks after they 're acclimated			1
two containers will be trucked sunday to @entity11 and flown by commercial carrier for the hour flight to @entity13			0
a @entity30 from @entity31 , one of the multiple corporate sponsors involved , can carry two containers each flight			0
half the initial herd moved will be adult cows			0
the rest of the herd will be juveniles two years old or younger			2
@entity40 will be barged to the area in summer			0
@entity43 feed on grasses , sedges and forbs and wider variety of other plants like the state 's abundant willow biologist @entity51 said : ' this has been an incredibly long project - 23 years in the making , ' to say we 're excited is an understatement			1
' the state hopes to complete the flights by tuesday but will proceed slowly if there are snags			0
@entity43 are very large , very powerful wild animals , @entity51 said			2
she added : ' we 're making them do something they do n't want to do / ' once in @entity13 , the bison will be kept in pens several acres large before being released in two or three week after ' they 're in good shape '			2
@entity43 are the larger of two subspecies of @entity5 bison but did not roam in lower 48 states			2
the smaller subspecies are plains bison , which were not native to @entity1 but were introduced to the state in 1928 , where they have thrived			0
@entity43 flourished for thousands of years in @entity1 but disappeared in the 1800s or early 1900s			1
they feed on grasses , sedges and forbs and wider variety of other plants , including @entity1 's abundant willow			1
the state had a strong interest in reintroduction as a source of food for subsistence hunters and as a game animal for sport hunting , but plans ran into a political snag			0
@entity43 flourished for thousands of years in @entity1 but disappeared in the 1800s or early 1900s in 2008 , the state imported 53 wood bison from a national park in @entity100 , adding to a smaller herd that was held at the @entity102 in @entity103			1
however , wood bison are a threatened species and state officials worried that the federal government would designate their new home in the wild as critical habitat , requiring consultation with federal agencies before oil and gas drilling or other development could occur			1
the problems were worked out			0
the @entity116 in 2013 declared that wood bison reintroduced in @entity1 would be considered an experimental population not essential to the continued existence of the species			1
the wood bison will be managed by state wildlife officials and exempt from certain restrictions in the @entity123			1
the @entity124 does not expect predators to be a problem			0
biologist @entity51 said : ' @entity128 do n't seem to know what to do with them			0
' @entity1 did not record a bear or a wolf killing a plains bison until nearly 30 years after they were introduced 87 years ago .			2
