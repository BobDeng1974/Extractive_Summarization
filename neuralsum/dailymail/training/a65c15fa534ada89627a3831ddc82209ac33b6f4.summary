@entity0 announced it was splitting its messaging services in april , and the changes have begun rolling out to users worldwide @entity0 has begun forcing people to use messenger after announcing its split for the main app in april			1
members have been left annoyed and outraged by the changes , and have flocked to the @entity11 app store @entity10 to complain			1
this is in addition to concerns being raised about the app ’s permissions , that give @entity0 access to send texts and make calls on the user ’s device			1
according to @entity10 , the app has access to find accounts on the device , read contacts , access the user ’s , as well as edit , read and receive text messages			1
other permissions give @entity0 the ability to directly call phone numbers , modify or delete files on usb storage , take pictures and videos , record audio , download files without notification , control vibration and change network connectivity			1
this has led to user ’s complaining the app violates their privacy			2
earlier this week , the app was averaging a one - star rating on the @entity48 , but has since risen to 4.1 – this is despite 90 per cent of the first 100 reviews rating it as low as possible			0
reviews on the store include : ‘ i do not want this messenger			0
why is @entity0 forcing this on everyone ? this application sucks			2
’ another reads : ‘ why does it need to have access to your phone data , audio , usb files , and network when you 're not even using it			2
oh and it can listen to your conversations and turn on your camera / recorder even when you 're not using it			0
big brother ! ’ one reviewer said : ‘ i like messenger , i just hope it ’s not true what they are saying that it 's not private anymore			0
’ and another added : ‘ calm down people ! of course it needs access to your camera , how else would it allow you to take and send pictures and videos through the app. ’ @entity86 , partner at @entity87 wrote : ' i 'm prepared to give up some personal data for the right to access a game , content , or social network for free and to have an improved advertising experience while enjoying that free service			1
' however , the current situation goes too far			0
it 's time we stood up and said " no ! " take the first step by deleting this app. ' @entity0 recently responded with a blog post explaining why it needs certain permissions			1
it said : ‘ almost all apps need certain permissions to run on @entity11 , and we use these permissions to run features in the app. ‘ keep in mind that @entity11 controls the way the permissions are named , and the way they ’re named does n’t necessarily reflect the way the @entity73 app and other apps use them			1
experts have also raised concerns about the vast number of permissions the app asks for on the @entity11 versions ( pictured )			1
these give @entity0 access to send texts , make calls , access usb storage and more find accounts on the device			1
read your own contact card			0
your approximate and precise location			0
edit , receive and read your text messages			0
test access to protected storage			0
modify or delete the contents of your usb storage			0
read phone status and identity			0
for example , it states that the picture and video permissions allow users to take photos and recordings within the app , and send to friends			1
it wants access to text messages to let people add mobile numbers using confirmation codes			0
@entity0 ’s ‘ call phone numbers ’ permissions means people can call a contact from within a message thread			1
@entity189 , principal mobile analyst at @entity190 told @entity191 that these permissions apply to @entity0 ’s main app , and many of them are standard for social media apps of this kind			1
he added the permissions @entity0 is asking for are needed for the app to be able to work in the way its users want			1
‘ if you ’re going to add voicecalls at some point , you ’ll need to access and sync your contacts			0
‘ if you want to take photos , the app will need access to your gallery			2
these are needed , however @entity0 probably could have communicated this better			2
’ other users have complained as to why @entity213 permissions are n’t so comprehensive , but this is due to the way the two different operating systems work			2
@entity11 automatically asks for permissions for all the actions the app is likely to take now , or in the future			1
by comparison , @entity221 software checks permissions on a task - by - task basis			0
@entity225 is n’t new , it originally launched in 2011			0
when asked why @entity0 decided to separate its apps , mr @entity189 said : ‘ @entity0 split the app so it could have a dedicated messenger app. this reduces the different ways in which @entity0 has to handle message in its standard app. ' voice calling has been ramping up , and by separating the apps , @entity0 can make this feature available			1
it would be too cumbersome to add to the standard app. ' this also makes voicecalling easier to deploy in other countries			0
‘ with a portfolio of apps , there ’s more room to manoeuvre ; you do n’t have to use @entity0 anymore			2
earlier this week , the app was averaging a one - star rating on the @entity48 , but has since risen to 4.1 ( pictured ) this is despite 90 per cent of the first 100 reviews rating it as low as possible			0
reviews on the store include : ' i do not want this messenger			0

’ analyst @entity279 , research director of @entity280 at @entity281 added : ‘ as with most changes that @entity0 makes , users are typically not happy in the beginning and they do n’t understand the motivations as to why the changes are being made			2
‘ and , as with most changes we see from @entity0 users will accept the change and just move on			2
‘ this issue probably wo n’t impact @entity0 over the long term			0
' for users annoyed with the change , there is currently an alternative way to use @entity0 messages , by accessing the site through a mobile browser			1
this lets users access and responded to messages without using the @entity73 app.			2
