three lucky punters had a day to remember on saturday , as joint @entity2 favourites @entity3 and @entity4 were dumped out of the competition			1
when putting a bet on , most could be forgiven for backing the favourites - especially when it comes to the @entity10 big boys - but a risk paid off as one @entity13 customer won £ 36,000 for a £ 2 stake			2
elsewhere , another punter had £ 100 on the @entity16 and @entity17 double - backing the two favourites to crash out - and even they must have been surprised come full time when £ 29,000 dropped into their account			2
@entity21 ( centre ) celebrates scoring the winning goal as his @entity17 team - mates enjoy the moment around him @entity16 striker @entity26 celebrates after scoring for his side against @entity4 completing the trio of huge @entity13 wins , a £ 2 five-fold including @entity17 , @entity16 , @entity29 ( who beat @entity30 ) , @entity31 ( who knocked @entity33 out at @entity34 's ) and @entity35 ( who brushed aside @entity37 ) won an unexpected £ 24,000			1
after the shocks of saturday afternoon - and @entity39 's failure to beat @entity40 , @entity31 are currently the highest - ranked of the teams left in the competition ahead of sunday 's games			0
@entity45 , who were themselves held to a goalless draw by @entity49 side @entity48 on friday night , have been installed as @entity49 's 3/1 favourites to lift the trophy from holders @entity52 , who are 7/2 second favourites			0
@entity54 ( right ) celebrates with his team - mates after scoring for @entity31 at @entity34 's @entity56 celebrates after scoring the winning goal in added time in north @entity57 against @entity30			0

there were @entity2 shocks as @entity4 and @entity3 crashed out
@entity4 lost to @entity16 while @entity3 were knocked out by @entity17
three lucky punters had unlikely **accumulator*s* that returned big money
one five-fold *accumulator* returned £ 36,000 from a stake of £ 2
