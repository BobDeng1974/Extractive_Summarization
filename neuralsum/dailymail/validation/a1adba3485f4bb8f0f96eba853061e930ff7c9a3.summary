@entity1 's navy today took delivery of its biggest warship since the @entity4 as it continues expanding its military capability in an attempt to shed its post-war pacifism			1
today the @entity8 , a helicopter carrier as big as the @entity11 aircraft carriers that battled the @entity12 in the @entity13 , was delivered to the navy in a crowning achievement for the nation 's military forces			1
with a crew of 470 sailors , it is a highly visible example of how @entity1 is expanding the capability of its military to operate overseas as prime minister @entity23 seeks lawmaker approval to loosen the restraints of @entity1 's pacifist post-war constitution			1
here civilians watch as it departs from @entity51 , south of @entity52 sailors stand at attention on the deck of the warship , while a @entity1 naval flag flutters before them			2
the huge warship is considered symbolic of @entity1 's growing military capabilities the 248metre ( 813ft ) long warship resembles @entity62 amphibious assault carriers in size and design but it is designated as a helicopter destroyer - a label that allows @entity1 to keep within the bounds of a constitutional ban on owning the means to wage war			1
aircraft carriers , because of their ability to project force , are considered offensive weapons			0
@entity76 , @entity1 's minister of defence , told media at the handover ceremony in @entity51 : ' the vessel can serve in a wide range of roles including peace keeping operations , international disaster relief and aid			2
it also helps improve our ability to combat submarines			0
' @entity1 is also adding longer - range patrol aircraft and military cargo planes to its defence capability , and buying @entity93 fighter jets , amphibious assault vehicles and @entity97 's @entity96 troop carrier , which can operate from the @entity8			1
president @entity23 's attempts to ease @entity1 's pacifist constitution and its build up in defence capabilities is unnerving neighbour @entity102			1
the @entity8 does not have a catapult necessary to launch fixed - wing fighters , but a planned vertical - take - off - and - landing ( @entity107 ) variant of the @entity93 could fly from the @entity8 's flight deck			0
based at @entity109 near @entity52 , also the home port of the @entity111 carrier battle group , the @entity8 will join two smaller helicopters carriers already in service that are also classed as destroyers			2
soldiers march and salute on the deck of the massive warship , which is capable of holding a maximum of 28 aircraft however , @entity1 classes it as a helicopter destroyer , a label that allows it to keep within the bounds of a constitutional ban on owning the means to wage war @entity76 , @entity1 's defense minister , speaks to naval soldiers during the commissioning ceremony of the @entity8 warship soldiers untangle a rope on board the aircraft carrier , which measures 250m in length @entity1 's constitution , known as the @entity136 , is most famous for the renunciation of the right to wage war			1
it was drawn up under the @entity141 occupation which followed the @entity4 and was intended to replace @entity1 's previous militaristic and absolute monarchy system with liberal democracy			1
@entity1 was responsible for drawing the @entity12 into the war after it launched a surprise attack on the @entity12 naval base @entity146 in 1941			0
the attack was intended as a preventive action to keep the @entity12 from interfering with its planned military actions in @entity151 , which included overseas territories of the @entity153 , @entity154 , and the @entity12			0
the conflict escalated massively when the @entity12 dropped an atomic bomb on @entity157 on august 6 , 1945			0
this led to the surrender of the @entity160 on september 2 , 1945 and brought the hostilities of @entity4 to a close			0
@entity1 's constitution was enacted on may 3 , 1947			2
@entity157 was left devastated ( pictured ) after the @entity12 dropped an atomic bomb on the city , ending the war and leading to the ' @entity136 '			0

@entity1 's navy has officially taken control of biggest warship the country has owned since the @entity4
the @entity8 , a 250m aircraft carrier , is as big as the @entity11 carriers that battled the @entity12 in the @entity13
it has a crew of 470 sailors and is symbolic of how pacifist @entity1 is expanding its overseas military capabilities
