it 's only day two of @entity2 's return to @entity3 and she 's already made an enemy of her conservative co-host , former @entity6 aide @entity5			1
the fracas started off with the question of whether president @entity9 is a people person and devolved when @entity2 took offense at the assertion by @entity12 that he might not be			1
' i 'm not saying things all @entity15 disagree with , ' insisted the @entity17 pr whiz , before @entity2 went on the attack			1
' he revealed was how personally wounded he was by that statement , ' @entity12 said of her then boss , who wrote of his dismay over @entity36 's assertion in his 2010 memoir decision points			2
she then called @entity2 's words ' an attack			1
' @entity2 snatched the opportunity to turn @entity12 's words against her			1
' he was very upset in the plane as he flew over @entity30 , ' quipped the comedienne			0
' it was a very long time before he showed up			0
that is a fact , not an attack			0
' @entity12 , who just the day before admitted on the show that she had nothing to do with @entity6 's decision not to visit @entity30 -- but simply fly over it -- was forced to agree			1
ironically , on the season 's same inaugural episode , @entity2 made sure to say of @entity12 : ' i like her , i swear ! ' whether that 's true or not , the hot and cold chemistry appears to have worked , at least for the time being			1
the season 15 premier on monday , which also welcomed @entity61 to the panel , won the show its highest ratings in eight years			1
according to @entity66 , it 's the second most watched premier ever for the daytime series			1
the argument began over @entity6 's handling of the @entity30 disaster , and @entity2 ended up forcing @entity12 to admit the president made a major mistake by taking so long to visit the ravaged southern city controversial : here , @entity6 and his @entity75 members discuss a response to @entity30 in august 2005			1
many critics point to the administrations sluggish response in helping the @entity80 as one of the biggest mars on @entity6 's presidency it likely did n't disappoint , at least not viewers interested in seeing @entity2 up to her old ( some say intentionally ) irksome tricks			1
complaining of sciatica , the comedienne did the entire show with no shoes on and at times rubbed her feet well above the table for all to see			1
backstage , @entity95 said the hosts had been told the past few years to avoid political topics			2
that clearly was n't the case monday , either , as the four cast members dove right into a discussion about domestic abuse and the @entity103 , along with changing attitudes toward corporal punishment			2
@entity2 said that while she was able to look past abuse charges against @entity107 and enjoy his work , she could n't do that with @entity110 and no longer sees his movies			1
@entity95 could n't stifle giggles when talking to @entity12 about @entity113 , with whom she clashed while working for the @entity17 's 2008 national ticket			2
' when did you want to just pop her ? ' @entity115 asked			0
otherwise , @entity12 struggled to get a few words in during her first show			2
' i 'm a @entity17 , we should get that out of the way , ' she said in introducing herself			0
as for @entity2 , she said she 's expecting a smoother time than her previous eight months on ' @entity3 , ' which ended in 2007			1
in part that 's because longtime producer @entity125 is out , replaced by @entity127 's former producer , @entity126			0
' we had a different idea of what the show could or should be , ' she said about her first tenure			0
' but when someone invites you into their house for dinner , you do n't rearrange the furniture			0
this is a new house with a new owner , and i was invited to consult on what the furniture should be			0
' unsanitary : @entity2 immediately perturbed her co-hosts by insisting on doing the entire show without shoes on monday back to their old tricks ? backstage , @entity95 said the hosts had been told the past few years to avoid political topics unimpressed : @entity61 voted to move on from the topic of @entity30 and @entity6 after @entity12 and @entity2 traded barbs @entity5 helped stir the first of what could be a lot of major @entity3 sparring matches			1
tuesday 's fight , which should be noted came in just the second episode of the season , started when she argued that @entity9 is n't much of a people person			0
' are you implying that @entity9 does n't ( love people ) ? ' @entity2 barked			1
' yeah ... i do n't think so , ' the former @entity6 aide replied			1
' oh , that 's bull crap , ' new host @entity61 snapped			0
' you are so wrong			0
' things became truly heated when @entity2 recalled rapper @entity26 's claims in the aftermath of @entity30 that @entity6 ignored black people			1
' let me just ask you something , when @entity26 says " i do n't think president @entity6 cares about black people " it 's like an international incident , ' she said			1
' but you can say that you do n't think @entity9 likes people ? ' ' @entity6 , when he wrote his book , one of the most interesting things he revealed was how personally wounded he was by that statement , ' said @entity12			2
@entity2 pounced , to audience applause			2
' i think he was very upset in the plane as he flew @entity184			0
' ' we talked about that yesterday , ' said @entity12			0
' @entity187 , one could understand the righteous anger of [ @entity26 's ] statement , ' @entity2 said			1
' let me just answer your attack on president @entity6 and @entity30 , ' @entity12 said			2
' a lot of people were very happy with what got done to rebuild @entity80			2
@entity80 is a safer place because of what it went through			2
' ' i did not attack him , ' @entity2 responded			2
' i simply stated the fact that he flew over in a plane before he ever went to address the people who were there and it was a very long time before he showed up			0
a nodding @entity12 was forced to agree			0
source : @entity205 she 's still got it ! despite her retirement , @entity3 co-creator @entity208 showed up for a cameo as the forum 's queen and proved she still knows how to produce controversy after tuesday 's fight and monday 's raked - in ratings @entity2 was the ringmaster during commercial breaks , taking a microphone and interacting with the audience			1
it created some moments funnier than what appeared on the air , like when one onlooker asked whether someone else might be added to the four - person cast			0
' this is n't enough for you ? ' she joked			0
' get the ( expletive ) out			0
' onscreen , she played a brief game with an audience member and @entity115 , asking them to guess which @entity2 had said or done certain things			2
also monday , @entity236 came on for a song in tribute to the late @entity239			0
@entity208 , who invented the format nearly two decades ago , watched the proceedings from offstage			0
she filmed an awkward show - opening segment seated in a ' throne ' where the four hosts briefly approached and bowed before her			2
@entity126 said he talked to @entity208 a couple of times a week to get advice			0
the new executive producer , brought on midway through the show 's makeover , said he was largely responsible for hiring @entity115 and @entity12			2
' this is our chance to take our leap forward creatively , ' @entity126 said			0
he said he hoped the audience would recognize that the four cast members are all smart , accomplished , able to have vigorous conversations and disagree with one another while still liking each other at the end			0
it 's a work in progress : except for one practice run - through , monday was the first time all four women had been together			1
@entity2 returned to @entity3 today for what is being billed as a new version of the long - running show			1
but apparently the cantankerous comedienne is up to her old tricks behind the scenes			0
sources at @entity3 tell @entity275 that @entity2 has already become a terror , only allowing the three new executive producers and co-hosts ; @entity95 and newcomers @entity61 and @entity5 , to communicate with her and making it clear to everyone in earshot , she 's literally running the show			1
' she was at @entity3 for several days last week , meeting with producers and telling them " how things are going to go "			0
she has a definitive view of how she would like the show to go and wants everyone else to fall in line , ' a show insider told @entity275 last wednesday , @entity2 and new co-host @entity291 did a test show with two fill - in hosts in an effort to build chemistry			1
neither @entity61 or @entity95 were present			0
despite the fact that @entity95 is the regular moderator for the show , leading the discussion , @entity2 took charge of the test show with @entity291			1
' it was almost as though she was rehearsing for when she eventually takes over as moderator			0
it 's clear that she would have preferred being in that capacity as she was before , ' offered our source			0
@entity2 joined @entity3 in 2006 , replacing @entity307			2
but the following year @entity2 and @entity308 had a heated exchange that got so intense producers cut to a split screen , something that @entity2 despised			1
she walked off the set that day and never returned to the show			0
but @entity95 was clear after @entity2 complained several times in recent days : ' i 'm moderating and that 's how it 's going to be , so work with me babe ! ' ' @entity2 actually said aloud , " this is taking forever ! i know we 're on tape , but should it take 4 hours ? " ' no one responds when she makes snarky comments except @entity95 , because everyone else fears for their job , ' detailed the source			1
the sentiment backstage after the test show was that the four co-hosts were ' boring together ' and they were going to have to find some excitement before today 's show .			1

the yin and yang co-hosts duked it out after @entity2 *slammed* @entity6 's sluggish response to help ailing @entity80
monday 's premier won the 15 - year - old show its biggest ratings in 8 years with *3.259* *million* viewers
the debut also included very *conspicuously* @entity2 's bare feet , which
