mr @entity2 interrupted proceedings to say : ‘ somebody asked how long the statement would run , but i would just point out , if i may , that there is intense interest in it and that the frequency of the prime minister ’s tennis playing on the one hand and his jogging regime on the other means that he is quite fit enough , i am sure			0
