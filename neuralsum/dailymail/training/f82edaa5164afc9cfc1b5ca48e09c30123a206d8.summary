@entity0 was given an extended contract until 2020 on wednesday , then told that failure at next year ’s @entity3 will not be tolerated			1
while some questioned the wisdom of making such a long - term commitment to @entity10 ’s head coach and his assistants , @entity5 chief executive @entity4 was defiant			1
‘ we want to win the @entity3 , ’ he said			2
‘ we are trying to galvanise the @entity10 coaching team and do our best to win it			1
there will be a review at various stages and one of those will be after the @entity3			2
it will be a very simple review if we win it			0
anything less than that , we ’ll review afterwards			0
@entity0 will coach @entity10 beyond the @entity3 in 2019 after being handed a contract extension the @entity5 also handed contract extensions to @entity10 coaches @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 @entity29 @entity10 coaches extend contracts to 2020 1969 : born october 9 in @entity31 , @entity32			1
1992 : makes his debut for @entity35 , where he became a regular and , eventually , captain			0
2000 : retires from rugby 2001 : appointed head of the @entity35 @entity40 2006 : becomes director of rugby at @entity43 , led them back to the @entity45			0
2008 : appointed the head of the @entity5 's elite player development 2010 : becomes manager of the @entity49			2
2011 : announced @entity50 would head up an interim @entity10 coaching team			1
2012 : @entity10 finish second in @entity53 , @entity0 is appointed @entity10 head coach			1
2013 : @entity50 's @entity10 are pipped to the @entity53 crown by @entity56 after losing 30 - 3 in @entity57			1
2014 : march - @entity10 again miss out on the @entity53			2
october 1 - @entity50 contract extended to 2020 by the @entity5 ‘ then you get into that delight of what is and is not acceptable below that and what the criteria are , and i ’d really rather not go into that			1
’ @entity0 said : ‘ it ’s great that the @entity5 have faith in us as a coaching group and their support has been critical to what we have achieved			1
while our focus is on the @entity74 international against @entity76 , and the @entity77 on home soil , we want to build a team that leads into @entity80 in 2019 and beyond			1
‘ we believe @entity10 is moving in the right direction , we have the right coaching and management team to take us forward and are excited about the challenge ahead			1
’ @entity4 admitted that approving contract extensions for @entity50 , @entity26 , @entity25 and @entity27 at this juncture is a gamble			1
‘ of course there are some elements of risk to it , ’ he said			0
‘ but coaching at international level is unique in that the time @entity0 and the coaches have with the players is limited and in that regard it requires a special and stable coaching team			2
‘ we therefore felt it important to secure their long - term future			0
’ one risk appears to be fudging @entity50 ’s remit			2
while part of his brief is to plan for the medium to long term , as he does so adeptly , the bottom line is the quest for here - and - now victories			0
@entity4 said : ‘ of course it ’s about results , but it would be short - term if you looked purely at results			2
you have to look at their contribution in a broader sense ; the relationships the guys have with directors of rugby , premier @entity10 , with the community game			0
results are extremely important , but there ’s more to it than that			0
’ @entity10 coaches ( from left to right ) @entity25 , @entity27 , @entity50 and @entity26 have been given new contracts matches won : 18 matches drawn : 1 matches lost : 11 win percentage : 60 points scored : 720 points conceded : 523 biggest win : @entity10 54 - 12 @entity139 ( nov 2012 ) worst loss : @entity76 36 - 13 @entity10 ( jun 2014 ) best record : 100 per cent records against @entity143 , @entity139 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 worst record : @entity50 ’s @entity10 have never beaten @entity148 @entity0 can not afford to think the same			1
despite the breathing space , he must see @entity151 success in this season ’s @entity53 and next year ’s @entity3 as a necessity			2
there have been too many barren years			0
@entity10 are undoubtedly a rising force but whether they can climb fast enough to mount a convincing challenge next year remains to be seen			1
first , they must negotiate their way out of a proverbial ‘ @entity158 ’ containing @entity159 and @entity56			0
even if that is achieved , going through as runners - up would surely leave them in the path of @entity148 , then the @entity164 , rather than on a less treacherous route to the final			0
no matter how difficult the terrain along the way , the world ’s richest union have a right to expect a minimum return of a semi-final place in this country , while reaching the final should be a realistic objective			0
the doomsday scenario of a pool - stage exit would leave @entity4 and the @entity5 board facing fierce pressure to consider a management change			1
@entity4 said @entity5 bosses acted swiftly to secure the long - term future of @entity50 and his coaching group @entity4 spoke of various objectives : plotting a course for @entity80 2019 while continuing the fine work of re-engaging with the rugby public			1
these are worthy targets , but they are more in tune with a wide - ranging director of rugby role			0
@entity0 is committed , resourceful and meticulous , but he should be left to focus on the approaching @entity3			1
in explaining the timing of this move , @entity4 said that the priority was to show ‘ four very talented coaches ’ that they are supported and valued , and to ward off potential suitors , should the @entity3 reach a glorious conclusion			2
there is sense in that , as @entity25 was previously coveted by @entity56 head coach @entity203 and @entity26 ’s motivational qualities are admired far beyond these shores			1
but @entity0 and his assistants are immersed in the @entity151 system and their salvage operation after the @entity210 debacle stems from a detailed knowledge of the domestic landscape that would not be an asset overseas			0
these patriotic men are unlikely to have their heads turned , aside from the prospect of a possible call - up by the @entity218			0
they are doing a good job , but this is still a profound leap of faith by the @entity5			0
‘ we have a belief that we are going to be successful , ’ said @entity4			0
he must hope this belief is well - founded to avoid the need for a grim post-mortem examination and regrets			0
@entity25 and @entity27 look on during the @entity45 match between @entity228 and @entity229			2

@entity0 and coaching staff handed six - year contract extension
deal will take the @entity10 coach beyond the @entity236 in @entity80
@entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 also given extensions
questions were raised over signing deals year before home @entity3
@entity5 chief executive @entity4 says the decision can ' galvanise ' @entity10
@entity50 is ' excited ' about the ' challenge ' of @entity247 in 2015 and 2019
