the world is aging so fast that most countries are not prepared to support their swelling numbers of elderly people , according to a global study by the @entity5 and an elder rights group			1
the report ranks the social and economic well - being of elders in 91 countries , with @entity12 coming out on top and @entity14 at the bottom			1
it reflects what advocates for the old have been warning , with increasing urgency , for years : @entity5 are simply not working quickly enough to cope with a population graying faster than ever before			1
@entity21 , 82 : ' i am most afraid of losing my mental and physical independence and becoming a nursing case			1
the biggest problem for the elderly is living a solitary life			1
' @entity28 , 65 : father of six daughters , three of whom are married , said he is terribly afraid of the absolute misery that may descend on his family if he , the only earning member , loses his job as a rickshaw puller retiree @entity35 , 63 : ' i am afraid of illnesses and being financially dependent on others			2
growing older , there is a great sense of fear of being alone			2
i have children , but they have lives too			1
what about other elderly who have no children ? ' by the year 2050 , for the first time in history , seniors over the age of 60 will outnumber children under the age of 15			1
@entity53 , who runs a small tea shop on the sidewalk near his home in @entity57 , @entity58 , is 65 and acutely aware that he , like millions of others , is plunging into old age without a safety net			1
he wishes he could retire , but he and his 61 - year - old wife depend on the $ 50 a month they earn from the tea shop			1
and so every day , @entity53 rises early to open the stall at 6 a.m. and works until 2 p.m. , when his wife takes over until closing			2
@entity66 , 80 : ' my biggest fear is that one day i will not have anything to eat or even the energy to work on my own			2
in the rural areas of my country , we , the elderly , die and nobody notices			2
as you become old , no one cares			2
' @entity79 farmer @entity78 , 75 : ' i 'm afraid that my children will hurt me , kick me out of my house and i will die alone			1
the biggest problem facing elderly @entity79 is the lack of health insurance and retirement pay like in civilized countries			1
' ' people at my age should have a rest , but i still have to work to make our ends meet , ' he says , while waiting for customers at the shop , which sells green tea , cigarettes and chewing gum			1
' my wife and i have no pension , no health insurance			2
i 'm scared of thinking of being sick — i do n't know how i can pay for the medical care			2
' @entity53 's story reflects a key point in the report , which was released early to @entity105 : aging is an issue across the world			2
perhaps surprisingly , the report shows that the fastest aging countries are developing ones , such as @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity58 , where the number of older people will more than triple by 2050			1
all ranked in the bottom half of the index			2
the @entity119 ( www.globalagewatch.org ) was created by elder advocacy group @entity120 and the @entity121 in part to address a lack of international data on the extent and impact of global aging			2
the index , released on the @entity5 's @entity129 , compiles data from the @entity5 , @entity131 , @entity132 and other global agencies , and analyzes income , health , education , employment and age - friendly environment in each country			1
@entity140 , 79 : ' i 'm afraid of nothing			2
i just do n't really know how to continue my life as i get older like i used to live for almost the last 80 years			2
i do n't like when young people treat me as an old man when i wait in line at the supermarket			2
' @entity148 , 67 : ' i 'm most afraid of losing my memory			2
with so many cases of @entity152 's , it frightens me			2
i worry about remembering the past , people and friends and the things i have done and ca n't recall			2
' @entity156 , 74 : ' i 'm not afraid of getting older			0
i surf , i fly fish in @entity158 , i teach at a high school			0
i happen to be a little different than most : i 'm religious			0
i 've taken vows of poverty , chastity , and obedience			0
' the index was welcomed by elder rights advocates , who have long complained that a lack of data has thwarted their attempts to raise the issue on government agendas			0
' unless you measure something , it does n't really exist in the minds of decision - makers , ' said @entity176 , director of ageing and @entity177 for the @entity131			1
' one of the challenges for population aging is that we do n't even collect the data , let alone start to analyze it			1
... for example , we 've been talking about how people are living longer , but i ca n't tell you people are living longer and sicker , or longer in good health			0
' the report fits into an increasingly complex picture of aging and what it means to the world			0
on the one hand , the fact that people are living longer is a testament to advances in health care and nutrition , and advocates emphasize that the elderly should be seen not as a burden but as a resource			0
on the other , many countries still lack a basic social protection floor that provides income , health care and housing for their senior citizens			1
@entity14 , for example , offers no pension to those not in the government			1
life expectancy is 59 years for men and 61 for women , compared to a global average of 68 for men and 72 for women , according to @entity5 data			1
@entity223 , 74 : " since @entity222 allowed me to live to 74 , i can only thank him			0
i am concerned for the young children , and i am really worried for their future			1
life is too expensive , there is too much unemployment			0
' @entity230 , 65 : ' my health is the problem , i do n't have strength , the way i am getting old			0
there are different types of old people			0
those who have money can be taken to the old people 's home			0
' that leaves @entity243 struggling to survive			0
at 75 , the former cook and blacksmith spends most of his day trying to sell toothbrushes and toothpaste on a busy street corner in @entity250 's main market			0
the job nets him just $ 6 a day — barely enough to support his wife			0
he can only afford to buy meat twice a month ; the family relies mainly on potatoes and curried vegetables			0
' it 's difficult because my knees are weak and i ca n't really stand for a long time , ' he says			1
' but what can i do ? it 's even harder in winter , but i ca n't afford treatment			0
' although government hospitals are free , @entity243 complains that they provide little treatment and hardly any medicine			0
he wants to stop working in three years , but is not sure his children can support him			1
he says many older people can not find work because they are not strong enough to do day labor , and some resort to begging			0
' you have to keep working no matter how old you are — no one is rich enough to stop , ' he says			1
' life is very difficult			0
' many governments have resisted tackling the issue partly because it is viewed as hugely complicated , negative and costly — which is not necessarily true , says @entity277 , chief executive of @entity120			0
@entity278 and @entity279 , she says , have among the highest proportions of elders in the world , but also boast steady economies			1
' there 's no evidence that an aging population is a population that is economically damaged , ' she says			1
@entity288 , 71 : ' @entity290 elderly have no biggest fears of old age , as our revolutionary government within its means helps us with minimal requirements - a pension , free medical care , food , home , and keeps us active in society			1
' @entity302 , 75 : ' i 'm not afraid of much but the thing that would upset me the most is if someone took away my car			0
i realize the day is coming as i continue to have birthdays that i wo n't be able to drive but that 's my freedom			0
' prosperity in itself does not guarantee protection for the old			0
the world 's rising economic powers — the so - called @entity314 nations of @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 and @entity319 — rank lower in the index than some poorer countries such as @entity322 and @entity323			1
however , the report found , wealthy nations are in general better prepared for aging than poorer ones			0
@entity12 , where the pension system is now 100 years old , makes the top of the list because of its social support , education and health coverage , followed by @entity334 , @entity279 , the @entity335 and @entity336			1
the @entity337 comes in eighth			0
@entity12 's health system earns praise from @entity341 , an 80 - year - old @entity342 resident			1
' the health care system , for me , has worked extraordinarily well , ' she says			0
' i suffer from atrial fibrillation and from the minute i call emergency until i am discharged , it is absolutely amazing			0
i ca n't complain about anything — even the food is good			0
' still , even in an elder - friendly country like @entity12 , aging is not without its challenges			1
the @entity12 government has suggested people continue working beyond 65 , a @entity354 cautiously welcomes but warns should not be a requirement			1
@entity341 also criticized the nation 's finance minister , @entity358 , for cutting taxes sharply for working @entity12 but only marginally for retirees			1
' i go to lectures and museums and the theater and those kinds of things , but i probably have to stop that soon because it gets terribly expensive , ' she says			0
' if you want to be active like me , it is hard			0
but to sit home and stare at the walls does n't cost anything			0

@entity12 came out on top and @entity14 was in last place
@entity5 are not working quickly enough to cope with a population graying faster than ever before
