by @entity0 published : 12:57 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 17:25 est , 13 november 2013 an @entity2 retiree expecting a shipment of photos from her dying father was floored by what she ended up receiving instead : 1,000 love letters he ’d sent her mother after @entity10 forced them apart			1
@entity12 says the lovesick and strikingly intelligent dispatches from the warfront were likely included by her fiercely private father , @entity15 , accidentally			1
but the error revealed an unbelievably complete account of what war was like for the young @entity19 and his wife @entity20			2
‘ in one of his letters he said he remembered kissing her in the snow that first night they met , ’ said @entity12 , whose book details the initially desperate but ultimately triumphant tale of her parents ’ early years as a couple fighting to stay together during @entity10			1
‘ he was from the other side of the tracks			2
’ her father was even the leader of a gang , @entity12 said , and her mother 's father was a national church leader , so the stakes were high			1
both for @entity20 and @entity15			1
while @entity15 may have been the frontrunner in the quest for @entity20 ’s affections , she had many other men vying for her			1
one thing that shocked @entity12 while reading her father ’s letters was learning that her mother had received marriage proposals from many men during the war			1
‘ she had so many other boyfriends , ’ said @entity12			1
‘ she was very beautiful and very talented			2
’ ' he remembered kissing her in the snow that first night they met ' : @entity12 immersed herself in the 1,000 pages of letters , which showed her a side of her parents she otherwise never would have known while he was dying of cancer in 2008 , @entity15 accidentally sent his daughter 1,000 pages of love letters he 'd sent his wife while he was at sea during the war from december 1941 to november 1945			1
@entity78 was so moved by the riveting , emotional courtship the letters revealed that she used them to write a book to @entity20 : a romance in two voices			1
she also has started a project dedicated to preserving the stories of @entity10 veterans called @entity88			2
@entity12 provided the excerpts below , taken from her father 's many letters : a 1942 photo of her father shows the @entity94 in his sailor 's uniform			1
over the course of several years , the letters @entity15 wrote to @entity20 show their budding romance , their near break - ups , and ultimately their marriage may 1 , @entity103 write that you wonder if the world will ever be the same again			1
of course , the world is going to settle down again			2
we ’ll all live those very normal lives — the sort of lives that we used to hate at times because they seemed to be so dull and uninteresting			0
i must keep believing that			0
we all must , or there is no use fighting.may 14 , @entity115 ’re now reading a letter from the happiest fellow in the world ! i ’ve got a brand new queen of the seas for my ship			0
honey , she ’s a huge @entity125 cargo ship			0
i ’m so excited that i ’m @entity126 ’s getting late			0
there are many things on my mind tonight			0
i want to lie here for a long while and figure things out			0
there ’s this business of secret codes , quite a load on my mind			0
but by tomorrow i ’ll have this ol ’ @entity141 mind cleared up , things in their right @entity143 , @entity138 - @entity137 have eased up with us , and i can now sit here and listen to a broadcast station again after dark			0
as i sit here , something somehow demands of me to remember how darn lucky i have been so far in life			0
things could be so different with me , could n’t they ? but here i am			0
feeling great , working at a good job , feeling as if i have a bit part in the war , and looking forward to a leave at home			2
there are luckier guys , i guess , but they ca n’t feel any happier than i do @entity159 25 , 1944sitting here with the static beating a regular tattoo on my ears , i suddenly got the brilliant idea to read over some of your letters again			2
maybe it ’s just that i happened to get the wrong letters , but in the three i picked up , @entity168 branded for life — a cynic , unfaithful dog , drunkard , @entity173 13 , @entity174 suppose that everyone at home is watching for the news of the invasion			2
i know that we all are hoping that they put it off for a while so we can get at least close to it when it starts			0
it ’s going to be something huge , and i ca n’t help but think that peace will come shortly after it starts			0
let ’s just hope that things go perfectly for the boys when they hit the beach over @entity192 is dark			0
i have a small desk lamp on , and the radio is playing static to me			0
the ship is asleep and quiet except for the throbbing of the thousands of horsepower pushing us along			0
there ’s a cigarette burning in the ash tray sending smoke up to be scattered by the fan which is spinning this hot , moist night			2
the ports are down , the huge steel doors are closed about me			0
i ’m quite alone with all of these dials , meters , trimmers , and gadgets			0
alone with my thoughts and my work			0
and my thoughts , quite naturally are about you			0
happy mistake ? as @entity15 was dying from lung cancer in 2008 , the @entity10 veteran mailed his eldest daughter four bankers ' boxes , each one overflowing with a lifetime of family photos			1
but in one box was something even more precious she ’d even accepted two rings			2
but @entity12 said that ’s just what women did in order to preserve soldier morale			1
' she was being a good girl and listening to @entity230 , ’ @entity12 said , referring to the famous etiquette writer of the day , who encouraged women to ‘ just say yes			1
’ so what made her mother say yes to at least two other men but ultimately marry her father ? it was n’t just his bad boy behavior , @entity12 said			1
‘ if you have the opportunity to read all the letters , you see he ’s so intelligent , ’ @entity12 said			1
‘ i think that attracted her			0
’ @entity247 sweets : the letters were typed on a mill , which was often used by seamen in order to translate morse code beautiful and talented : while her father was smitten by her mother , @entity12 says that her mother often dreamed of bigger things outside marriage and family and nearly walked away from the relationship code : the couple used a code when describing geography , presumably as a way to reveal information soldiers were supposed to keep secret the couple met just after @entity265 , @entity12 told @entity266 , and the letters spanned from december 1941 to november 1945			1
in between , there were hardships			0
@entity15 was at sea for long stretches and there was even a time when @entity20 nearly chose another man			1
‘ he almost lost my mother , ’ @entity12 said			1
but on his final leave in 1945 , after @entity20 lied to her parents in order to go see @entity15 , something changed			1
‘ she was just swept off her feet on that last leave he had , ’ she said			0
‘ she gave up her dreams of being something big like a movie star			0
’ at midnight on july 14 , 1944 , @entity20 and @entity15 were married in @entity286			1
two hours later , @entity15 was shipped out to sea for the final time			1
thankfully , the couple would have a joyous reunion in due time and go on to raise a family together			2
one that included a daughter who , until both were dead and gone , had no idea how romantic her parents ’ courtship had been			1
her historical novel to @entity20 : a romance in two voices is based on that courtship and was as much a means of understanding her parents as it was a way to celebrate them and other couples like them			1
‘ i learned so much about the war			2
i learned how tough it was			0
i learned how hard it was for these men , and how lonesome it was for them , ’ @entity12 said			2
‘ but i also learned how tough it was on the women			0
it 's like their lives stopped because all of the young men were gone			0
’ @entity15 signed his letter ' beat , ' for his last name , which was @entity15			2
according to his daughter , @entity15 numbered the letters so that @entity20 could line them all up in proper order smitten : @entity15 was fiercely intelligent , says @entity12 , and his bad boy ' other side of the tracks ' attitude made him fascinating to her bishop 's daughter mother married : despite the obstacle of a world war and several falters , the couple eloped in 1944 just hours before @entity15 was shipped out to sea for the last time to @entity20 : @entity12 ( pictured ) has written a book about her parents based on the letters she discovered and describes the experience of uncovering their past an emotional one ' i learned so much about the war ' : @entity12 says writing her historical fiction around her father 's touching letters became a lesson about the war 's high cost on the then youthful @entity347			1

@entity2 retiree @entity12 was shocked to find the reams of emotional letters her father sent her mother while the war kept them apart between 1941 and 1945
she believes her *deeply* private father @entity15 , who was in the @entity357 , accidentally included the letters in a box of photos he sent her before his death in 2008
' he remembered kissing her in the snow that first night they met ' : @entity12 has turned the amazing story of her parents ' tragic separation and triumphant reunion into an historical novel about love during wartime
