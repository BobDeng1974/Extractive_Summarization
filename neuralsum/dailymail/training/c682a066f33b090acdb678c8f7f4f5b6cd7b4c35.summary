@entity0 successfully launched its biggest ever rocket today in an effort to ramp up its ambitious space programme			1
the rocket , designed to carry heavier communication and other satellites into higher orbit , blasted off from @entity8 in the southeast state of @entity10			1
the launch was the next crucial step in @entity0 's space programme history , after the nation successfully put a satellite into orbit around @entity17 in september			1
@entity0 today announced two more successes in its space program — launching the country 's largest rocket and testing the re-entry of an unmanned crew module , part of @entity0 's quest to send humans into space ' this was a very significant day in the history of ( the ) @entity0 space programme , ' @entity29 ( @entity29 ) chairman @entity28 said from mission control			1
@entity29 scientists have been riding high since an @entity0 spacecraft successfully reached @entity17 on a shoe - string budget , winning @entity38 's race to the red planet			2
although @entity0 has successfully launched lighter satellites in recent years , it has struggled to match the heavier loads sent up by other countries			1
the new rocket , weighing 630 tonnes and capable of carrying 4 tonnes , is a boost for @entity0 's attempts to grab a greater slice of the £ 190 billion ( $ 300 billion ) global space market			1
the rocket was carrying the crew module and released it 78 miles ( 125km ) above the @entity52			1
the pod , meant for carrying two to three astronauts , splashed down in the @entity55 @entity0 , which is striving to become a player in the multi-billion dollar space market , has successfully launched lighter satellites in recent years , but has faced problems sending up heavier payloads			1
pictured is the @entity61 which launched today ' @entity0 , you have a new launch vehicle with you			2
we have made it again , ' @entity29 mission director mr @entity63 said			2
' the powerful launch vehicle has come to shape , which will change our destiny ... ( by ) placing heavier spacecraft into communications orbits			0
' the rocket - officially named the @entity72 - was carrying an unmanned crew capsule			1
@entity29 said this successfully separated from the rocket and splashed down in the @entity55 off @entity0 's east coast 20 minutes after liftoff			2
@entity29 says the crew capsule project would take at least another seven years to reach the point where an astronaut could be put into space			1
@entity0 prime minister @entity82 hailed the test mission as ' yet another triumph of ( the ) brilliance and hard work of our scientists ' in a post on @entity90			0

the new rocket , weighing 630 tonnes and capable of carrying 4 tonnes , is a boost for @entity0 's attempts to grab a greater slice of the £ 190 billion ( $ 300 billion ) global space market the 630 - tonne @entity108 ( @entity109 ) blasted off from @entity8 in the southern state of @entity10 on this morning , the @entity0 space agency reported the rocket blasted off from @entity8 - barrier island off the @entity55 coast located in @entity10 in september , @entity0 triumphed in its first interplanetary mission , placing a satellite into orbit around @entity17			1
in scenes broadcast live on @entity0 tv , scientists broke into wild cheers as the orbiter 's engines completed 24 minutes of burn time to place the spacecraft around @entity17			0
scientists described the final stages of the @entity127 , affectionately nicknamed @entity127 , as flawless			0
the success marked a milestone for the space program in demonstrating that it can conduct complex missions and act as a global launch pad for commercial , navigational and research satellites			1
reaching the fourth planet from the sun is a major feat for the developing country of 1.2 billion people , most of whom are poor			0
at the same time , @entity0 has a robust scientific and technical educational system that has produced millions of software programmers , engineers and doctors			0
@entity0 describes @entity127 as the first successful @entity17 mission on a maiden attempt by any country , although @entity150 also did it on its first @entity17 mission in 2003			0
rival @entity152 is also expanding its space exploration program with a space station in orbit and the landing of a lunar rover on the moon earlier this year , although it has not sent a satellite to @entity17			1
@entity0 also as its sights on a low - budget missions to land on the moon and study the sun after its recent space successes			2
' the aim is three years from now , an @entity0 lander and @entity0 rover will land on the moon , ' mr @entity28 said			0
' we have a programme to study the sun that is by putting a satellite into the sun - @entity52 lagrangian point , ' he said , referring to the position where the satellite , held by the pair 's gravitational pull , can orbit with them			2
@entity0 has come a long way since it began its space programme half a century ago when it set up the first rocket launch pad in a field in the southern state of @entity184			1
a church in a fishing village was the agency 's main office			0
the chairman said the agency was reaping the benefits of years of hard work , after sticking to its ' mantra of self reliance ' rather than relying on other countries for assistance			0
@entity197 sanctions were slapped on @entity0 after it staged a nuclear weapons test in 1974			0
@entity29 also remained committed to its national mandate of benefitting the ' common man ' - for example by launching @entity0 satellites that help with weather projections and disaster management - in a country with tens of millions of poor			2
' twenty - two years we worked on it ( a launch vehicle for satellites and other craft ) and we got it			2
we adapted and we improved , ' said mr @entity28			0
' it was not a soft route , it was the hard route			0
' the @entity61 rocket shoots skyward past a flock of geese , from the @entity217 island of @entity8 in september , @entity0 triumphed in its first interplanetary mission , placing a satellite into orbit around @entity17			1
scientists described the final stages of the @entity127 , affectionately nicknamed @entity127 , as flawless			0
an artist 's impression of the spacecraft is pictured a comparison of how much countries have spent on their attempts to reach @entity17			0
both @entity230 and the @entity231 failed their first attempts to @entity17 , while the @entity152 mission to @entity17 , dubbed @entity236 mission failed in 2011 and the @entity238 mission to @entity17 ran out of fuel			0

the rocket can carry heavy communication satellites into higher orbit
it blasted off from @entity8 in the southeast state of @entity10
@entity248 was carrying a capsule
this capsule could *someday* take two to three astronauts into space
