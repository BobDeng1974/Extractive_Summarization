by @entity0 published : 10:51 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 14:04 est , 27 august 2013 up to 260 convict mothers every year apply to bring up their babies behind bars , @entity1 can reveal today			1
around 75 children are currently spending the first 18 months of life in jail to prevent them being separated from their mother			1
the female prison population has more than doubled to more than 4,000 since 1997 and currently around two a week will become a parent while in jail in a ' worrying ' trend			1
start to life : this prison mother holds her child while watched by a prison warden at the baby unit at @entity18 in @entity19 new figures from the @entity21 reveal that 711 new mothers have applied for one of these spaces , but they are so oversubscribed only 220 have been successful since 2010			1
it means that many will be taken into care or looked after by family outside the prison walls			0
in most cases , the mother were sent to prison for crimes committed while pregnant			0
@entity34 , criminologist and director of the think tank @entity36 , said : ' this is a worrying trend and deeply regrettable for the children who are spending their infancy in jails			1
but culpability lies with their mothers			2
' nobody should be spared a custodial sentence on the ground that they have children			2
prison acts as a deterrent â€“ we can not send a message that people with children will get away with crime '			2
services : @entity57 in north @entity58 is one of seven jails with baby units attached for its female inmates rules : this baby is one of around 75 that the prison service have space for , pictured here in at the ' light room ' at the newly refurbished @entity70 and baby unit of @entity57 in @entity58 there are seven prison baby units around the @entity74 , including @entity75 in @entity58			1
in order to qualify , the majority of the mothers will have committed serious crimes while pregnant , including violence and drugs offences			2

@entity85 , of @entity86 , took a 14 - year - old boy to a hotel for sex and got him high on cannabis			0
@entity92 @entity91 heard that after she was arrested , she deliberately got pregnant with a new boyfriend - thought to be an attempt to stay out of prison			0
but judge @entity96 , @entity97 , told her that would not dissuade him from locking her up - because a man who preyed on a young girl would face jail			2
he said : ' the law sets out to protect those that are under the age of consent , whether they are boys or girls , from those who would take advantage of their youth			0
' they are not to be preyed upon by those who are older than them , and certainly over the age of consent , and that is why these are very serious offences			0
' in the first 18 months women will be able to feed and play with their child , and are given childcare so they can take part in other elements of prison life			1
government guidelines insist young children behind bars must have contact with their family and see the world outside prison , with trips outside jail with nursery nurses to go shopping and visit local parks			1
the cost of formula and nappies would be taken from the prisoner 's benefits			0
after the 18 month period is up , if their mother is still imprisoned , they will be returned to life on the outside , either with a family member or in care			0
a spokesman for the @entity148 said : ' forcibly separating a baby from his or her mother should only be done to protect the welfare of the child and too many babies are being taken away from mothers in prison ' the government offers the places in the ' assumption that the best place for a young child is with his or her parent '			1
each application by a mother is considered by a board who will recommend to a prison governor if it would be best for the child if they come to prison			0
' we provide @entity172 for the benefit of the prisoners ' babies who would otherwise have to be separated from their mothers			1
the primary consideration is the best interest of the children , ' he said .			0
