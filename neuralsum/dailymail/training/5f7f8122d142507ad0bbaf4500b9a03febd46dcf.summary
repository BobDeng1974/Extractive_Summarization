it 's not easy being beautiful ! poor @entity1 the phrase ' nobody likes a show - off ' does n't apply to the realm of celebrity , where boasting about your natural gifts , fame and achievement while pretending not to do so has become something of an art form			1
the actress @entity1 demonstrated it this week , bragging about her greatest asset by seeming to dismiss it			1
discussing her striking looks , she said : ' obviously they got me contracts ... but there have been as many , if not more , parts that i have n't got because of the way i look			1
' ah , poor love			1
the stresses you have to deal with			1
but @entity1 is not alone			1
in fact , a new word has been invented for these boasting - by - stealth celebrities who tell us how marvellous they are while disguising their vanity with a quip			1

@entity102 : so weird to be back and know my collection is being worn around the country ... # humbledandproud @entity105 : now , please @entity106 , let your telly be free of me for a while			0
oh s * * * , @entity111 is still on ... @entity112 : i ca n't do the ' mean stare ' @ bad drivers in traffic anymore cos they just go ' oh look it 's @entity112 ' & start waving , then i wave back @entity118 : wow ! i still ca n't believe i have a @entity120 cover # randomtweet @entity121 : had fun [ on the @entity123 ]			0
@entity124 , a movie star & shared a valentine with a pop icon			0

@entity150 : i always wanted to have a lot of friends but i never imagined it would be so many ... 86m ! so humbled , ca n't thank you guys enough for your support			0
i feel so fortunate to have you			0
@entity157 : if your a-level results are n't joyous take comfort from the fact i got a c and two @entity162			0
