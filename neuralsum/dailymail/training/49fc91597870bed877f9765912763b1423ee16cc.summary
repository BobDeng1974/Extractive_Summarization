by @entity1 reporter when @entity2 was four months old , she could n't bear to be held by her parents			1
confused that their daughter seemed to be in pain from their touch , @entity4 and @entity5 took her to the doctors - and were stunned to learn her body was unable to make bones			1
now more than six years on , in a show of medical and the extraordinary bravery of @entity2 and her parents , the young girl is growing - and has even learned how to dance			1
@entity2 , from @entity18 , @entity19 , was born with the most severe form of hypophosphatasia , an extremely rare bone disorder which leads to loss of all bone mineralization during childhood			1
' she did n't used to like to be held in my arms , ' her mother added			0
' the only thing she liked was to be put up on a pillow			0
that would make her comfortable			0
' she was unable to move any of her body , and her bones did n't even show up on x-rays			1
by the time she turned two , she was still relying on ventilators and tracheotomies as she did not have ribs to support her breathing - and her parents were uncertain how much longer she would survive			1
@entity54 : @entity2 , who is nearly seven and improving every day , loves to bop to music in her stroller progress : the little girl 's bones were so small they could not be seen on x-rays after she was born , but 18 months after taking a new drug doctors saw she was developing a rib cage @entity2 has a rare condition called hypophosphatasia , a genetic disorder that affects the development of bone and teeth			1
it can cause a loss of all bone mineralization			0
the condition occurs due to an enzyme deficiency , which causes the bones to become soft as they ca n't absorb important minerals such as calcium and phosphorus , increasing the risks for pain and bone deterioration			2
the condition affects about one in 100,000 babies born in the @entity81 the earlier the diagnosis is made the more severe the skeletal manifestations			0
more than half of those born with the disease do n't survive beyond their first birthday			2
a milder form , which can be diagnosed in adulthood , occurs more frequently			2
depending on the severity , people with the condition might see deformities of the limbs and chest and regular fractures			0
losing teeth earlier than usual could also be a sign			0
but when she turned two years and eight months old , her parents put her forward for a clinical trial involving an experimental medicine at @entity104 at @entity105			1
the clinical study treated nine toddlers from across the world with a biologic enzyme called asfotase alfa , which encouraged bones to grow			2
a special port was inserted into her abdomen so she could receive the drug			2
@entity2 was the smallest child in the study , and while the other children started noticing bone growth as soon as three weeks after taking the drug , it did not appear to be working for @entity2			1
' we were fearful that her bone disease was so terribly severe that it might not work , ' dr. @entity121 , a metabolic bone disease specialist with @entity123 , said			0
' we were very concerned when the therapy started that there was no mineral in her bones to target with enzymes , ' he told @entity39			1
' so would the enzyme find its way to bone and hook onto something to help her ? but apparently - although you could n't see the mineral on an x-ray - there was still enough there that the first molecule or enzyme to land did something			0
' but her parents started noticing she was gaining muscle control and , after a year of treatment , she was finally able to move all of her limbs			1
after 18 months , her ribs started to form			1
now , four years since the start of her treatment , she no longer uses a ventilator and loves dancing and bops along to music in her stroller			2
thankful : she is pictured with her mother @entity5 and father @entity4 ( right ) when they met the leader of the clinical trial , dr. @entity121 ( left ) , for the first time this month care : doctors at @entity104 at @entity105 have celebrated her progress she uses a wheelchair and she is still the size of a child half her age , but her bones are growing and doctors are hopeful			1
they hope to be able to remove her tracheotomy tube this spring , which has prevented her from speaking			0
her cognitive abilities will be tested in july - but she appears to be improving each day			0
' this is why we get into medicine in the first place : to truly make a difference in the life of a child , ' her physician , @entity173 , @entity174 , a pediatric endocrinologist at @entity105 , told @entity182			0
' my goodness , to go from no bones to bones			2
that 's the most impressive thing i have seen as a physician			0
' see below for video			0

@entity2 was four months old when she was diagnosed with a rare disorder which stops bones forming during childhood
she could not move or breathe on her own
before her third birthday , she started taking part in new drug trial
now she is breathing and eating and enjoys bopping in her stroller
