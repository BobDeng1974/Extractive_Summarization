a new documentary about the deadly @entity1 featuring interviews with former investigators claims that the official explanation given for the ill - fated flight is wrong			2
the flight crashed off the coast of @entity8 in 1996 , killing all 230 people on board in what is the third - deadliest aviation accident in @entity13 history			1
the official explanation given by the @entity17 was that the crash was caused by a gas tank explosion , but the documentary gives ' solid proof ' there was an external detonation , its co-producer said			1
many eye - witnesses claimed they had seen a streak of fire heading towards the plane before it crashed			2
theories have suggested it was a missile strike from a terrorist or @entity32 vessel , and that the incident was subject to a government cover - up			1
' of course , everyone knows about the eyewitness statements , but we also have corroborating information from the radar data , and the radar data shows a ( n ) asymmetric explosion coming out of that plane - something that did n't happen in the official theory , ' @entity45 told @entity57 's @entity56			2
he said many witnesses said that there was an external force and ' there 's no evidence ' of the explosion in the center wing tank			0
he added that none of the witnesses had been allowed to testify			0
the producers have now submitted a petition signed by former investigators calling for the @entity17 to reopen its investigation , based on the new evidence , @entity45 told @entity57			1
among the whistle - blowers who worked on the investigation are @entity75 , a senior accident investigator , @entity77 , a @entity79 investigator , and @entity80 , an accident investigator for the @entity81			1
investigators who worked on the plane following the crash and co-producer @entity45 , said there was no evidence that the explosion came from the wing tank @entity89 : images from the documentary show damaged seats on the plane , aboard which 230 people died ' we were n’t allowed to talk about the @entity37 investigation when we were inside , ' @entity77 said			1
' we had to retire first			0
' what [ witnesses ] told us does n’t fit the mechanical failure scenario that was presented to the public at the end of our investigation			0
' ' the very next day [ after the crash ] , the @entity107 came to speak to me and said , " you did not see that , you saw nothing " , ' one investigator said			0
the documentary features interviews with these key members of the original investigation team , who now claim that their investigation was systematically undermined			1
' this team of investigators who actually handled the wreckage and victims ' bodies , prove that the officially proposed fuel - air explosion did not cause the crash , ' said the film 's producers			1
' they also provide radar and forensic evidence proving that one or more ordinance explosions outside the aircraft caused the crash			0
' the whistleblower team claim that at the time they were placed under a gag order by the @entity17 , which they charged falsified the official conclusion of the cause of the crash , reports @entity137			1
however , the statement said they did not speculate about the source or sources of any ordinance explosions			0
the deadly crash occurred just 12 minutes after take - off from @entity144 on the flight bound for @entity39 , @entity146			2
skeptic : @entity80 , an accident investigator for the @entity81 who appears in the documentary , inspects damage after the crash			0
right , part of the plane 's wing is seen in the water off @entity38 officials have dismissed allegations of a cover - up , saying evidence strongly points to their conclusion more than 600 people gave eye - witness accounts after seeing the plane crash and the majority described seeing a ‘ rising streak of light ’ moments before the crash ' which many believed was a missile hitting the plane			1
many witnesses to the accident had seen a ' streak of light ' that was usually described as ascending , moving to a point where a large fireball appeared , with several witnesses reporting that the fireball split in two as it descended toward the water			0
there was intense public interest in these witness reports and much speculation that the reported streak of light was a missile that had struck @entity79 800 , causing the airplane to explode			0
these witness accounts were a major reason for the initiation and duration of the @entity107 's criminal investigation			0
' revelations ' : the documentary , @entity37 , premieres on july 17 at @entity195 on cable network @entity43 an image shows the reconstructed section of the plane			0
although 90 per cent of the aircraft was recovered , only the section around the central fuel tank was reconstructed approximately 80 @entity107 agents conducted interviews with potential witnesses daily			0
they conducted a 16 - month investigation and concluded that there was no evidence to indicate that any criminal act occurred			2
the @entity17 told @entity57 that it was aware of the documentary and that the producers intend to file a petition to reopen the investigation			1
' as required by @entity17 regulation , a petition for reconsideration of board findings ... must be based on the discovery of new evidence or on a showing that the board 's findings are erroneous , ' @entity17 spokeswoman @entity214 said in a statement			1
the documentary - @entity37 – premieres on july 17 , the anniversary of the crash , at 8pm et on cable network @entity43 .			2

members of the original investigation team claim their report into the 1996 crash was subject to a government cover - up
