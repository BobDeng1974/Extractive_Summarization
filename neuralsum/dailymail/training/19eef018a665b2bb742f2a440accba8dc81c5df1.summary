@entity0 last night attacked ‘ bizarre ’ claims that his decision to go to war with @entity3 in 2003 caused the current wave of violence in the country – and blamed everyone but himself for the crisis			1
the former prime minister insisted he was right to topple @entity10 with the @entity11 and said things would have been worse if the dictator had not been ousted from power a decade ago			1
mr @entity0 ended a week - long silence after mounting claims by diplomats and @entity18 that his and mr @entity20 ’s handling of the @entity21 sowed the seeds of the attempt by the @entity26 - backed @entity25 terror group to conquer @entity3			1
in a 2,800 - word ‘ essay ’ on the new @entity29 conflagration , mr @entity0 refused to apologise and argued : @entity0 , right , pictured alongside @entity20 , left claimed their handling of the @entity3 war is not responsible for the current crisis facing the country defiant mr @entity0 said he was determined to reply ‘ forcefully ’ to ‘ inevitable ’ claims about his record in @entity3 following the rapid advance of @entity25			1
‘ i understand , following @entity37 and @entity3 , why public opinion was so hostile to involvement			2
‘ but every time we put off action , the action we will be forced to take will ultimately be greater			0
instead of re-running the debate over @entity3 from 11 years ago , we have to realise that whatever we had done or not done , we would be facing a big challenge today			2
‘ it is bizarre to claim that , but for the removal of @entity10 , we would not have a crisis			0
we have to re-think our strategy towards @entity50 and support the @entity3 government in beating back the insurgency			1
‘ extremist groups , whether in @entity50 or @entity3 , should be targeted			1
however unpalatable this may seem , the alternative is worse			0
’ mr @entity0 hit back at critics who say false claims that @entity10 had deadly chemical weapons fatally undermined the @entity0 - @entity20 justification for the @entity21			1
turning the argument on its head , he said it was essential to picture @entity3 with @entity10 still in power : he had used chemical weapons before and would have done so again			0
@entity26 backed terrorists , pictured , are currently marching on @entity65 after major successes in northern @entity3 and , confronted by the ‘ @entity67 ’ of 2011 , @entity10 would have provoked ‘ a full - blown sectarian war across the region with national armies ’			1
‘ we have to liberate ourselves from the notion that “ we ” have caused this – we have n’t , ’ said mr @entity0			1
and he pointed the finger of blame at @entity3 prime minister @entity76 – and more pointedly at mr @entity77 – for leaving @entity3 defenceless			1
‘ three or four years ago , @entity26 in @entity3 was a beaten force			1
the sectarianism of the @entity76 government snuffed out a genuine opportunity to build a cohesive @entity3			2
and there will be debate about whether the withdrawal of @entity11 forces happened too soon			0
’ in response , residents of @entity65 , pictured , are preparing to defend their city against the terrorists approaching from the north mr @entity0 poured scorned on the @entity93 ’s decision to topple @entity95 ’s @entity94 who ‘ gave up wmds and co-operated in the fight against terrorism ’ while letting @entity50 ’s president @entity99 , who ‘ kills his people on a vast scale including with chemical weapons ’ , off the hook			1
‘ there is no easy or painless solution			0
the @entity108 groups are never going to leave us alone			0
9/11 happened for a reason			0
‘ this is , in part , our struggle , whether we like it or not			0
’ @entity77 was ‘ right to put all options on the table in @entity3 , including military strikes			1
the choices are all pretty ugly , but @entity50 is slowly but surely wrapping its cords around us , pulling us down with it			0
we have to act now to save the future			0
’ @entity121 , whose ‘ @entity123 ’ soldier son @entity122 was killed in the @entity21 , told @entity124 last night : ‘ i wondered when @entity0 would surface to try to justify himself			1
before he and @entity20 kicked down the door on @entity3 , @entity126 and @entity127 lived side by side			0
now there is a power vacuum , which allows terrorists to walk into the country			0
‘ @entity10 may have been an evil dictator , but @entity3 needs a strong leader to keep the tensions in check			2
@entity0 installed a weak puppet government			2
when @entity122 was killed , the @entity3 police meant to be protecting the @entity138 ’ position dropped their guns and ran			2
that is what the @entity3 forces did this week			0
’ mr @entity121 added : ‘ it is lamentable that @entity0 is still banging the @entity147 drum			2
he and @entity20 must take ultimate responsibility			0

former *pm* claims bungling @entity3 government has allowed @entity26 return
@entity0 said the alternative to not *intervening* in @entity3 was a far worse option
@entity0 said @entity93 was wrong to topple @entity94 instead of @entity99
@entity77 ordered @entity11 troops to leave @entity3 too soon .
@entity160 and @entity11 must *launch* *renewed* military attacks in @entity3 and @entity50 .
@entity26 was ‘ beaten ’ in @entity3 thanks to the @entity163 , but the bungling @entity3 government let them back in .
