key elements of the @entity4 are to be re-written to stop driverless cars bringing gridlock to @entity8 's city centres , the official @entity1 review into self - drive vehicles will announce tomorrow			1
but the re-write will also serve to allow groups of cars and lorries to run far closer together in ' convoys ' or ' platoons ' with separation gaps between automated vehicles just a fraction of the recommend spaces between automated vehicles compared to those with drivers			1
rules on tailgating may need to be removed entirely to enable the driverless cars to run almost nose to tail – taking up less road - space , reducing jams an improving fuel efficiency thanks to on - board sensors that can act with far more precision than a human driver			1
key elements of the @entity4 are to be re-written to stop driverless cars bringing gridlock , pictured five drivers steered automated @entity36 ’ into a convoy at a test track in @entity39 a @entity41 insider said : ' it seems likely that the introduction of driverless cars wil in due course necessitate changes to regulations , to common practice and to conventions governing the interaction of road - users			1
' other parts of the @entity4 are on course to be relaxed because driverless cars can pass other vehicles with greater precision			1
so recommended passing distances to cyclists and pedestrians may have to be changed to prevent self - driving vehicles clogging up highways across the country			0
under the existing @entity4 , drivers overtaking cyclists are expected to leave as much room as they would leave for a car			2
the official review into driverless cars , to be published on wednesday , will confirm that the @entity4 will need to be reviewed			1
rules on tailgating may need to be removed entirely to enable the driverless cars to run almost nose to tail , pictured @entity73 's early protype for the a two - seater self - driving car on saturday the @entity75 revealed exclusively that ministers would give the green light to trials on public roads of the new vehicles which will not require a licence to drive			1
insurance costs could be slashed because the machines are less likely to make an error , say experts			0
transport minister @entity86 said recently : ' driver and human error is reported to account for over 90per cent of traffic incidents , and so it is clear that driverless cars will make a huge difference			1
' using the technology to manage traffic flows on trunk roads will smooth traffic flows and reduce the stop / start of congestion , which will , in turn , reduce emissions and improve fuel consumption			2
' she added : ' we are also looking at ' platooning ' of heavy goods vehicles on the trunk road network			0
i am sure you will know that platooning is the electronic coupling of vehicles to run in close formation			2
by allowing vehicles to run closer together , the government recognises the potential fuel and carbon savings , reduced congestion by creating more efficient use of the network , and reduced road casualties by eliminating driver error from accidents			1
' @entity122 has begun testing the driverless - car technology			2
here , a driver drinks tea as his car automatically drives itself , keeping a safe distance from the lorry in front @entity130 , head of an academic research programme in @entity132 and part of one of three official pilot programmes , said : ' if everyone obeyed exactly what it said in the @entity140 , the roads would probably grind to a halt			0
if we ask driverless vehicles to respect every aspect of the @entity4 we will quickly discover that some things would be unworkable			1
' the government 's major six month feasibility study into the practical , safety and legal issues surrounding the autonomous ' robo - cars ' will conclude that there is ' no barrier to testing driverless technology on @entity8 roads ' from this summer			2
it paves the way for the first proper tests on @entity8 highways of vehicles that drive themselves amid other cars and real traffic			0
until now the technology has only been trialled on private land or specialist test facilities			0
but in a move that puts the government on course to fulfil its ambition to make the @entity8 the world centre for self - driving vehicles – and draw in lucrative foreign research investment - the report will advise that ' the @entity8 is well placed to lead the development of driverless technology			0
' the report is expected to distinguish between ' highly automated cars ' fitted with steering wheels and pedals in which motorists will be expected to take control at any time , and ' fully ' automated cars , where a licence will not be required because they are essentially a passenger in ' a car which is capable of operating on the road network without hman intervention			0
' in this case ' a driver need not be able and ready to assume control			0
' drivers of highly automated cars could still face prosecution and penalties for mobile phone use , failure to wear a seatbelt and eating at the wheel			0
