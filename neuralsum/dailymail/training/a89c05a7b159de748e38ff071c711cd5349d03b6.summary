such was the ease with which @entity1 broke down @entity2 in exactly four minutes on saturday night that he immediately returned to his dressing room to hit the pads with his trainer for half an hour			1
‘ i was scheduled for 10 rounds and it only went two , so it was back to work to make up the rest , ’ he said			2
that warm - down was just five minutes shorter than the time the heavyweight has spent in the ring since making his professional debut at the same @entity15 12 months and nine fights ago			1
@entity1 fired out a warning to his rivals with the crushing defeat of veteran @entity20 @entity2 @entity1 's warm - down lasted just five minutes less than the @entity23 - born fighter spent in the ring he displayed a hitherto unseen menace as he licked his lips , grinned , and brutally dismantled the @entity20 veteran of 47 fights			1
@entity2 had not been stopped in almost a decade and was expected to give @entity1 the rounds he craves , but proved to be just another punch bag			1
‘ it ended a bit early , ’ lamented @entity1			1
‘ i wanted to learn and practise some stuff			2
even when i was an amateur , i had a desire to hurt opponents			2
when i ’m sparring , i get that same vision i had against @entity2 , i want to get you , i want to hurt you			1
i ’ll never forget where i came from and that gives me that desire			0
these guys are in there to take what i ’ve been working towards for seven years			0
‘ they ( his fights ) get stopped pretty early			1
i wanted him on the floor , out cold			0
@entity1 batters @entity2 as the @entity47 racks up his ninth win in his ninth professional fight ‘ i do n’t like it when the referees step in and stop the fight			1
that ’s why i end up hitting them because they get in the way ! ‘ it ’s fun			0
if he had me up against the ropes , punching my head , he would love it but it ’s the other way round			2
’ @entity1 picked up the @entity60 title , little more than a piece of expensive bling , which will head straight into storage			1
but the lasting impression will linger long in the heavyweight division			2
‘ i need to put this behind me , ’ was @entity1 ’s oft - repeated mantra as the 24 - year - old attempts to keep his feet on the ground while others predict both fame and fortune			1
‘ not everyone will get knocked out like that , not everyone will fold under pressure			0
there ’s a whole ocean of heavyweights out there , ’ he added			0
‘ there ’s been a long line of heavyweights and there ’s always two or three that rise to the top			0
i ’ve got the potential but i ’ve got to graft and grind to bring that dream to a reality			0
’ and after a low - key 25th birthday on wednesday , @entity1 must turn his attention to six weeks hence when he faces @entity92 in @entity93			1
@entity2 looks to hit back but he was overwhelmed in a fight which was stopped in the second round @entity1 celebrates victory in the ring with his team of trainers and promoter @entity100 ( right ) the 39 - year - old from @entity102 had won five consecutive , if underwhelming , fights before he was knocked out in the first round by an unheralded @entity104 in june			1
promoter @entity100 was barely half - joking when he said he could imagine @entity92 having a change of heart or at the very least demanding a larger cheque			0
while @entity1 insists he remains ‘ the contender ’ , @entity100 has long predicted a @entity109 title fight at @entity23 ’s @entity110 next summer , just three miles from the @entity111 where @entity1 grew up			1
beyond that the likes of @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 will follow his every move			0
the man himself would go as far only to say that he hoped to be at the top of the domestic pile by the end of his second year			0
as for his first , the @entity122 champion refused to rate himself higher than one out of 10			0
‘ i ’ve got years to go , ’ he added			0
‘ let me do the same thing to @entity124 then i ’ll give myself a 10			0
that was @entity2 not @entity124 , he ’s not a world champion			2

@entity1 stopped @entity2 in the second round in @entity129
the @entity23 fighter now has a *record* of nine wins from nine fights
@entity2 had not *previously* been stopped for almost a decade
with the win , @entity1 now holds the @entity60 heavyweight belt
@entity1 's impressive win provides a warning to his rivals
