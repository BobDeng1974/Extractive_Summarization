it was the maths problem designed for 14 - year - olds that baffled people around the world			1
for those who did not manage to work out the cryptic clues that were designed to lead them towards the fictional @entity10 's birthday , then the answer was july 16			1
those who were able to reason their way to this answer followed a series of logical steps that allowed them to rule out the other dates given as part of the question			1
the question , ' so when is @entity10 ’s birthday ? ' was one of 25 questions set in the @entity23 and @entity24			1
at first , it appears impossible to answer without more information but pictured is the method used to work it out the question , ' so when is @entity10 ’s birthday ? ' was one of 25 questions set in the @entity23 and @entity24			1
it asked : @entity32 and @entity33 just became friends with @entity10 , and they want to know when her birthday is			0
@entity10 gives them a list of 10 possible dates : may 15 , may 16 , may 19 , june 17 , june 18 , july 14 , july 16 , august 14 , august 15 and august 17			1
@entity10 then tells @entity32 and @entity33 separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively			0
the puzzle asked : @entity32 and @entity33 just became friends with @entity10 , and they want to know when her birthday is			0
@entity10 gives them a list of 10 possible dates			2
may 15 , may 16 , may 19 june 17 , june 18 july 14 , july 16 august 14 , august 15 , august 17 @entity10 then tells @entity32 and @entity33 separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively			1
@entity32 : i do n’t know when @entity10 ’s birthday is , but i know that @entity33 does not know too			0
@entity33 : at first i do n’t know when @entity10 ’s birthday is , but i know now			0
@entity32 : then i also know when @entity10 ’s birthday is			0
so when is @entity10 ’s birthday ? @entity32 said : ' i do n’t know when @entity10 ’s birthday is , but i know that @entity33 does not know too			0
@entity33 said : ' at first i do n’t know when @entity10 ’s birthday is , but i know now			0
' @entity32 said : ' then i also know when @entity10 ’s birthday is			0
' to reach the answer , it is possible to work through the information both men known to rule out nine of the dates in a number of steps			1
first , we know @entity10 has already told @entity32 the month of her birthday , and @entity33 the day			0
each of the men does not know what the other has been told			0
so , for @entity32 to be ' certain ' that @entity33 can not know the answer - as suggested in the first statement he makes - we can deduct that the birthday can not possibly be in may or june			2
this is because in the months of may and june there are numbers ( dates ) that only occur once across the four months - namely may 19 and june 18			2
if @entity32 had been given may or june as the month , there is no way he could be sure @entity33 did not already know the birthday as @entity33 might have been the number 18 or 19			0
for @entity32 to be ' certain ' that @entity33 does n't know , @entity32 must have been given a month that does not contain one of these ' unique ' dates - i.e. july or august			1
the problem was posted on @entity71 by ‘ @entity23 ’ television presenter @entity72 , and went viral as people posted their various solutions to the problem			1
it was set for 14 - year - olds in the @entity23 and @entity79 ( @entity78 ) , which were held on april 8 ( stock image of exam room shown ) @entity32 's disclosure now gives @entity33 the clue he needs to work out the birthday for himself			1
@entity33 only knows the number of @entity10 ’s birthday , but from @entity32 ’s statement he has now also ruled out both may and june			0
this is because he realises @entity32 has ruled out may and june because of the ' single number ' aspect above			0
as @entity33 says he knows the date , we can whittle it down further to three dates by ruling out the numbers that appear in duplicate			2
if @entity10 had told @entity33 that her birthday fell on the 14th of the month , then he could not have worked out the date at this stage			0
however , as he states that he now knows the date , we can rule out july 14 or august 14			2
this leaves just three dates to chose from - july 16 , aug 15 and aug 17			1
following @entity33 's statement , @entity32 is then apparently also able to deduce the date of @entity10 's birthday			0
this means her birthday must be the only remaining date in the month he was originally told			0
given that there are two dates left in august and one in july , it has to be the july date			2
so the answer is july 16			1
organisers of @entity78 said the question was set to filter out the most intelligent of participants			1
this year around 28,000 students from countries across the world including @entity23 , @entity119 and the @entity120 took the test the problem was posted on @entity71 by ‘ @entity23 ’ television presenter @entity72 , and went viral as people posted their various solutions to the problem			1

this year around 28,000 students from countries across the world including @entity23 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity119 and the @entity120 took the test			1
@entity132 , executive director of @entity78 , told @entity133 : ' being @entity134 out of 25 questions , this is a difficult question meant to sift out the better students			2
@entity78 contests target the top 40 % of the student population and the standards of most questions are just high enough to stretch the students			2
' of course , perhaps the more important question is whether @entity10 deserves a birthday gift at all after putting us through all of this .			0

@entity150 problem set for 14 - year - olds left people around the world baffled
question uses logical reasoning to rule out all of the dates apart from one
it was set in the @entity23 and @entity160 ( @entity78 )
teaser generated *furious* online *debate* - but correct answer was july 16
