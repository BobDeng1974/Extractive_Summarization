strewn with algae , dirt and graffiti , they are a sad echo of a very @entity6 golden age			1
some of the country 's grandest swimming baths lie abandoned and derelict , as documented in stunning new photographs by @entity11 - born photographer @entity10			1
the 37 - year - old was captivated by the urban decay of @entity6 's pools , which took off during a boom for public swimming in the late @entity18 era			1
many stayed open for more than 70 years , but have been forced to shut by dwindling numbers , council cuts or high - spec gyms			2
these incredible images by @entity10 , 37 , show the decline of @entity6 's swimming baths and lidos , which once numbered into the hundreds			1
public baths saw a surge in popularity from the @entity18 era but many have since closed @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , which opened in 1932 and closed in 1988			2
the pool is pictured in a dire state , with filthy water in the deep end			2
the photographer said : ' i fell in love with these decaying , dry buildings			0
i thought i could stand with my camera inside the pools and tell the story from the swimmers ' point of view ' at a monstrous 73 yards long , @entity53 , @entity39 , opened in 1935 and included a unique 12 - sided star shape in its centre			1
the pool shut in 1998 , and for years was left strewn with dead leaves and graffiti			0
it has since reopened with many of the @entity62 listed features restored and was used as a training pool for the @entity64 mr @entity10 stood in the shallow end of former pools and lidos in @entity39 , @entity68 , @entity26 and @entity69 for a series called @entity71			1
some had been closed only a few years before he began his project			0
the @entity73 in @entity68 was drained and demolished in 2007 to make way for a new leisure centre			0
others had been closed for more than 20 years when mr @entity10 launched his project , including @entity77 in @entity39 , which shut its doors in 1988			1
he said : ' i fell in love with these decaying , dry buildings			0
i found some great examples of forgotten baths and pools			0
' i thought i could stand with my camera inside the pools and tell the story from the swimmers â€™ point of view			1
' standing inside the pools , i realized how these places represent an authentic testimonial to bygone times			2
' they were in vogue places , and fundamental to life years ago			0
' @entity96 - which draw their name from the @entity11 word for beach - exploded in popularity in @entity6 from the end of the 1800s			1
the craze reached its peak in the 1930s , when councils across the country built more than 150 of the outdoor pools			0
on summer days , revellers in traditional full - body bathing suits and caps would jostle for space on stone and concrete promenades			0
there was a surge too in indoor pools , which gave more serious - minded swimmers space to practice			2
with high arched ceilings and hundreds of seats for spectators , they continued to be built beyond the @entity123			0
the spectacular marble - lined @entity124 in @entity39 opened in 1931 , in a congested area of the capital not accustomed to wide open space			2
it shut in 1997 for redevelopment and has since reopened as the centrepiece of the @entity131 , with many @entity62 listed original features retained it is more than 20 years since the closure of @entity135 in south east @entity39 , and it is showing its age			1
opened in 1924 , it was once a haven for outdoor swimmers			0
the decline of public swimming means 10 pools in @entity39 have closed since 2010 , though another 24 have re-opened , according to figures from @entity145 @entity69 's @entity146 opened in 1907 and closed almost a century later , in 2004			1
since then the ornate @entity148 building has been at the centre of a fierce battle between history - lovers and @entity152 , which initially said it could not afford the repairs			0
earlier this year former @entity154 councillor @entity154 vowed to chain himself to the building in protest			0
it now appears the pool may have won a reprieve , with locals still bidding for lottery funding @entity164 's @entity163 , which opened in 1937 and closed in 2006 , are popular with historians and local photographers if not swimmers			2
the once gleaming white pool and arched ceiling now show signs of age , though the striking black - and - white image of a diver on the rear tiles still looks as clear as the day it was made as @entity6 advanced through the 1970s , 80s and 90s , the pools ' popularity waned			1
ten swimming pools have closed down in @entity39 since 2010 alone , while 24 have opened , according to figures from @entity145			1
mr @entity10 , who moved to @entity39 from @entity181 in 2002 , said : ' gradually , living conditions and tastes changed , resulting in a drop in attendance , leaving the public pools uneconomical to run			1
' many fell into decay and many were demolished			0
they were symbols of civic and architectural pride in @entity18 times			0
today only a handful of them remain			0
' the series allows us to reflect on water and its importance it has for the development of human society			0
' @entity201 in @entity39 were open for almost a century since 1907			2
the @entity148 pool closed for health and safety reasons in 2006 when problems with the roof were identified , and has since been demolished			0
like many old pools , it has been replaced with a state - of - the - art new leisure centre , which opened last year @entity68 's @entity73 opened in 1965 and closed in 2008			2
though newer than some pools , it too was demolished and replaced with a new sports centre bathers at the @entity215 in @entity216 , @entity217 , pictured left in june 1939 ; right , bathers shiver before jumping into the @entity218 in @entity39 's @entity219 outdoor swimming was not confined to the big cities			1
here hundreds of swimmers jostle for space at the bathing beach lido in @entity225 , @entity226 , in 1935 @entity39 's @entity227 in june 1955 on the day it recorded the highest visitor numbers in its history			1
sadly , public pools have since declined			1

@entity11 - born photographer @entity10 , 37 , captured the decline of @entity6 's public swimming from the shallow end
he *decided* to take the photos from inside the swimming pools to tell the story from the swimmers ' point of view
ten public pools have been shut completely and another 24 shut and reopened since 2010 in @entity39 alone
