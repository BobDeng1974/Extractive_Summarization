by @entity0 published : 19:00 est , 27 june 2012 updated : 05:10 est , 28 june 2012 tense time : @entity1 , pictured with @entity2 on the @entity3 of the @entity4 on tuesday , faces the @entity6 ruling on his healthcare reforms @entity1 faces @entity8 as the @entity6 is set to announce today whether his healthcare reform will be struck down and attorney general @entity10 faces being held in contempt of @entity12			1
having spent his first 14 months in office on achieving @entity14 , for the former constitutional law lecturer to see his signature reform declared unconstitutional would be a humiliating blow			1
in ramming the bill through @entity12 , @entity1 failed to secure a single @entity20 vote , thereby shedding his campaign image as a bipartisan uniter			1
although passing the bill was a legislative victory , the reform itself has proved to be a political millstone			2
the censure of @entity10 , in which a number of @entity30 are poised to join @entity20 , would also be a major embarrassment because @entity1 has claimed executive privilege , something he blasted his predecessor @entity35 for doing			1
@entity20 on @entity36 have pursued @entity10 tenaciously over the botched ‘ gun walking ’ sting operation in which thousands of weapons were allowed into @entity39 and into the hands of drug criminals			1
two of the weapons were found at the murder scene of border agent @entity45			0
with the @entity6 justices peppering @entity1 ’s lawyer with hostile questions about @entity14 and @entity20 united and in control of the @entity50 , the @entity4 is bracing itself for a dismal day			1
if the legislation is upheld , presumptive @entity20 nominee @entity57 can run on repealing it if he ’s elected – an almost sure - fire crowd pleaser			1
but if @entity14 – formally named the @entity14 – is struck down in whole or in part then @entity1 will look like a failure as well as a president who has exceeded his powers			1
a split decision might be the worst outcome for him as full rejection would force republicans to come up with an alternative plan and full support would hand @entity57 a popular rallying cry for repeal			0
@entity1 ’s planned strategy for the reform being struck down was to condemn the @entity6 justices as being controlled by a partisan core of right - wingers			2
but that has been undermined by this week ’s split ruling over the @entity89 immigration law in which conservative chief justice @entity90 wrote a majority opinion that largely backed the @entity1 administration			0
under pressure : the censure of attorney general @entity10 ( pictured ) , in which a number of @entity30 are poised to join @entity20 , would also be a major embarrassment for @entity1 deep in discussion : @entity10 with chairman of the @entity100 senator @entity99 the day before a ruling on his role in withholding documents in a weapons crackdown @entity8 for @entity1 comes at a perilous moment for him			1
he faces a brewing rebellion among @entity30 who are refusing to attend the national convention in september where he is due to be crowned as his party ’s nominee			1
at least three @entity30 senators and eight members of the @entity50 have said they will not attend the party festivities in @entity114 , @entity115 – a clear sign that they view the @entity1 brand as toxic			2
among those who will stay at home is senator @entity119 of @entity120 , who was virtually attached to @entity1 ’s hip on his campaign plane in 2008			0
representative @entity123 , head of the @entity124 , urged all democratic candidates to stay away , saying : ‘ if they want to win an election , they need to be in their district			0
’ although @entity1 leads nationally by three per cent in the @entity133 national average , undecided voters tend to break decisively against incumbents and there are a number of alarming underlying factors for the president			2
outlook : house speaker @entity140 ( right ) and @entity4 minority leader @entity141 ( left ) are seen together on wednesday a day before historic @entity143 decisions are to be made in the latest @entity146 / @entity145 poll , 49 per cent felt less optimistic about the economy as a result of recent news , 53 per cent disapproved of @entity1 ’s handling of the economy and a whopping 61 per cent felt the @entity143 was moving in the wrong direction			2
although @entity1 retains some strength in swing states and has boosted himself with @entity158 voters because of his recent decisions to allow up to 800,000 young illegal immigrants to stay in the @entity143 , his number sin each of those key categories have slipped since the last @entity146 / @entity145 poll			0
@entity1 faces criticism from the @entity163 over his aggressive drone strike policy in @entity165 and @entity166			0
@entity167 , the former president who backed him over @entity168 in the 2008 primaries , this week wrote that the @entity143 under @entity1 was ‘ abandoning its role as the global champion of human rights '			0
decision : having spent his first 14 months in office on achieving the healthcare reform , it would be a humiliating blow to @entity1 if his signature reform is declared unconstitutional ' strategy ' : it 'll be hard for @entity1 to blame right - wingers for @entity6 decisions after this week 's ruling over the @entity89 immigration law as conservative chief justice @entity90 mostly backed the president @entity167 charged : ‘ revelations that top officials are targeting people to be assassinated , including @entity143 citizens , are only the most recent , disturbing proof of how far our nation 's violation of human rights has extended			1
’ the unusual criticism from a former president comes just weeks after @entity198 stated that @entity57 had a ‘ sterling ’ business record and that the work of @entity202 , @entity57 ’s former private equity firm , was ‘ good work ’			0
@entity198 ’s words undercut the centrepiece of @entity1 ’s attacks on @entity57 – which have led to his campaign vastly overspending , even as @entity57 outraises him – which have been that he is a corporate predator who has made profits out of cutting jobs			0
senior @entity57 officials , however , believe that the attacks only emphasise that the @entity20 was a hugely successful businessman whereas @entity1 , who has never held a job in business , has presided over an economy in which unemployment has just risen to 8.2 per cent			2
