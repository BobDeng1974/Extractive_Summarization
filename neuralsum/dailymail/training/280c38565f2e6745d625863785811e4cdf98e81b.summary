by @entity0 published : 04:03 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 04:41 est , 9 may 2013 a remarkable set of family pictures showing the doomed @entity5 royal family 's private moments has been has been found in the vaults of a remote @entity8 museum			1
the photographs show the royals in the months and years before @entity11 was forced to abdicate as the toll of the @entity13 and the storm clouds of revolution overwhelmed the @entity16 which had ruled as autocrats for more than 300 years			1
two years before the emperor and his family were shot dead by the @entity20 on the orders of @entity23 founder @entity22 , he is showing apparently teaching his youngest daughter @entity25 how to smoke			1
newly - discovered pictures show @entity11 with his 15 - year - old daughter @entity25 in @entity27 , apparently teaching her to smoke in this 1914 picture , four years before their execution , @entity11 's heir @entity28 is seen with sisters @entity33 , left , and @entity34 , right grand duchess @entity33 is seen looking through a family album - a neat twist to the newly - discovered photographs of the @entity16 the princess is seen puffing at the cigarette with every encouragement from the @entity41 and @entity42			1
' at the time there was not the same stigma attached to smoking , ' reports the @entity46 , which revealed the pictures found in a museum in @entity49			1
' in fact a year earlier @entity25 had written to her father : " i am sitting here with your old cigarette that you once gave me , and it is very tasty "			0
' another photograph taken by the tsar the same year - 1916 - shows @entity28 , heir to an autocratic throne that would be abolished only months later , posing on a tree in winter with his beloved pet spaniel @entity60			2
the boy is also shown playing on a beach with his father			0
these young royals @entity25 and @entity28 would soon be key figures in the mystery of what became of the @entity16			1
for decades there were claims , widely believed in the @entity71 , that one or both had survived the 1918 shooting			2
the pictures , including this one of @entity75 are thought to date from the time of the @entity13 the grand duchesses @entity33 and @entity34 are seen posing in the outdoors in this private family photo taken in 1916 @entity34 is seen again surrounded by flowers as she reads the execution in @entity82 wiped out @entity5 's last royal ruler , his former empress @entity84 , and their other three children , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity87			1
@entity11 abdicated his throne in 1917 as revolution swept @entity5			1
he and his family were placed under house arrest in @entity92 , then evacuated to @entity93 in the @entity8 in august that year			1
the @entity20 came to power in october 1917 and by march 1918 the family were forced to live on soldier 's rations			1
the next month , the @entity98 moved the @entity16 to @entity82			1
there were plans to put @entity11 on trial , but these were scuppered when the city became the target of the rival anti-communist @entity104			1
the @entity20 decided to shoot the entire family on july 17 so they could not be rescued by the @entity104			2
they woke them , told them to get dressed and pretended they were being moved from @entity82 away from the oncoming battle			0
they were shot in a basement and their bodies buried in a pit near the city			0
their remains were reburied in 1998 by the @entity5 government , who gave them a state funeral			0
in the event , the scientific analysis of bones found in a forest in the late @entity23 era and subsequently has shown that all were indeed killed in 1918 when the @entity128 were concerned that white forces could reach and free the abdicated tsar and his family			1
the remains of @entity25 and her brother who perished aged 17 and 13 respectively were , however , buried separately from the rest of the family after their slaying			2
' the images of @entity28 show a surprisingly strong boy given that his haemophilia saw him portrayed as sickly			0
' indeed it was his serious illness that led his mother to rely on debauched holy man @entity144 , a relationship that did much to undermine royal credibility as the country became embroiled in an ugly war and revolutionary fervour , ' said the @entity46			0
in one of the earlier pictures - snapped by the tsar and his children - the four carefree @entity16 princesses are seen in 1914 aboard the royal yacht @entity156 on the @entity157			2
the same year at @entity159 , the tsar is shown relaxing on rocks in a picture almost certainly taken by one of his children using a camera he had imported from @entity165 or the @entity166			0
and in another picture , the @entity167 , @entity28 and the boy 's tutor are seen walking an elephant near their palace in @entity92			0
a zoo on the estate would be closed after the 1917 revolution , but on this day the ruler wrote in his diary : ' took the elephant to our pond with @entity28 today and had fun watching him bath			0
' @entity182 is seen on a hospital visit to injured servicemen grand duchess @entity34 is seen with an unidentified soldier in another photo from the collection with war breaking out in 1914 , the unfortunate heir is shown in a military game with his tutor 's two smaller children			0
some of the pictures - including the one of @entity194 - were taken near @entity27 from where @entity11 commanded @entity5 forces during the war			2
the tsar wanted his family around him			2
other pictures show the older princesses visiting wounded soldiers in military hospitals			0
the images have been released 400 years after the @entity16 dynasty came to power in @entity5			1
' the emperor was very fond of photography and passed his passion for it to his wife @entity182 and children , ' said @entity212 , an historian at @entity213 where the album was hidden in @entity23 times			0
another picture shows @entity11 and @entity28 on a boat in @entity218 the pictures , including this of @entity11 , left , are held at the @entity220 it remains unclear how the several hundred pictures came to be in this remote city			1
one theory is that the album was taken from the royals by a revolutionary called @entity228 , nicknamed @entity229 , who was an escort when the exiled royals were brought westward from @entity93 in @entity232 to @entity82 on their final journey before they were shot			0
