by @entity0 published : 10:06 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 15:35 est , 18 april 2013 as people lay badly bleeding in the smoke of the @entity5 bombings , rescuers immediately turned to a millennia - old medical device to save their lives — the tourniquet			1
using belts , shirts and other materials , they tied off bleeding limbs in fast - acting bids to prevent major blood loss , shock and death			1
such fast work no doubt saved many lives , doctors at @entity19 area hospitals said			2
so it 's interesting to note that if this had happened a decade ago , many emergency responders might have avoided the tourniquet			1
heroes in @entity19 : a man tries to stop the bleeding of the leg of a man injured in the first explosion at the @entity5 , using a tourniquet as recently as the early 2000s , the tourniquet was still enmeshed in a long standing controversy about whether they were more trouble than they were worth			2
' some people saw them as lifesaving , and others said they were the instrument of the devil , ' said dr. @entity44 , an orthopedic surgeon with the @entity46 's @entity45 in @entity47			2
although tourniquets have been used to stem blood loss since at least the time of the @entity52 , modern military surgeons had grown to doubt it			1
there were no good studies proving their benefit			2
and there was a common belief that some tourniquets could do more harm than good , cutting off blood and oxygen to limbs and resulting in amputations			1
some tourniquets that were used in the right situation were not tight enough , causing bleeding to actually get worse			1
some were not wide enough			0
compression device : @entity19 firefighter @entity69 carries an injured girl away from the scene , who sports a tourniquet on her calf making a comeback : a decade ago , many emergency responders might have avoided the tourniquet ( women pictured after the @entity19 bombings ) ' there are a number of ways to mess it up , ' said @entity44 , who is a leading researcher on methods to control bleeding			1
' in @entity87 , tourniquets were not typically used ' because it was thought they led to many amputations , said dr. @entity91 , an @entity46 lieutenant colonel who is chief orthopedic surgeon at @entity92			1
tourniquets date back to @entity94 , when @entity52 used the device to control bleeding during amputations			1
@entity98 surgeon , @entity97 , then developed the idea further in 1718 by creating a screw device for occluding blood			0
the tourniquet was continued to be used regularly in the surgical field in the 1800s and 1900s , before some military personnel questioned their effectiveness in the early 2000s			1
they were n’t used typically in the @entity107 because some professionals thought they led to many amputations			1
the compressing device works by controlling blood circulation during traumatic bleeding			0
a stick or some other elongated object supports the tourniquet once it ’s twisted around the stick to stay fastened			0
that 's because tourniquets often were placed too high above the injury , leading to loss of tissue that otherwise might be saved , he said			1
now they are used lower , and ' a lot of lives and limbs have been saved by the use of a tourniquet , ' @entity91 said			0
the @entity129 came to call tourniquets a last resort for stemming severe bleeding			1
the dust settled only in the last decade , according to some experts , following publication of studies from the @entity137 war by @entity44 and others that showed tourniquets were clear - cut lifesavers			1
those studies showed timely use of tourniquets could raise survival rates as high as 90 percent			1
tourniquets are now routinely issued to soldiers			1
however , some experts remain cautious about their use			0
the @entity129 , for example , continues to worry that tourniquets may be used improperly or in situations when blood loss is not great enough to warrant their use			1
' clearly , if a leg is blown off , it 's ok to go straight to tourniquet , ' said dr. @entity152 , a member of the @entity129 's scientific advisory council			0
but the @entity129 continues to advise that direct pressure be applied to a wound in less extreme situations			0
tourniquets should be at least 1½ inches wide , and pulled very tight , to properly shut off blood flow			2
medical supply companies make tourniquets that do the job best			2
@entity152 also stressed that it 's important to use a real tourniquet if possible			0
news coverage of the @entity19 tragedy describes emergency responders using all sorts of things as makeshift tourniquets , including neck lanyards			2
' is a lanyard better than nothing ? probably , ' @entity152 said			0
but other kinds of care , and rapid transport to hospitals , may have been at least as important as tourniquets , he added			2
medical advice : doctors say , ' clearly , if a leg is blown off , it 's ok to go straight to tourniquet ' ( @entity19 marathon victim pictured ) monday 's blasts injured at least 170 people near the finish line of the @entity5			0
three spectators died and 13 people lost one or more limbs			0
@entity189 of @entity19 was with his wife and friends watching another friend cross the finish line when the explosion occurred			0
@entity189 's wife had an injury to her lower left leg			0
another woman with them had a leg injury , too			0
@entity189 ducked into a nearby sports store for t - shirts that they tore to create a tourniquet			2
at @entity206 , surgeons fixed the smaller of the two bones in her lower left leg that was apparently shattered by shrapnel from the blast			0
' my worst fear was that i could have lost my wife			0
other than that it was autopilot , adrenaline , chaos			0
there was a lot of just ' not - even - thinking , ' sort of animalistic , you know , thought			1
what needs to be done , you do it , ' @entity189 said .			0

the once - doubted devices may not have been used a decade ago under *similar* circumstances
tourniquets were used by the @entity52 and gained *popularity* during the 1800s and 1900s but were then doubted in recent times
tourniquets were *n't* used during the @entity107 because some military thought they led to more amputations
