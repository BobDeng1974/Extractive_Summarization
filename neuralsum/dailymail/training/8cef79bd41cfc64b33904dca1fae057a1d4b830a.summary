by @entity0 , deputy political editor @entity1 : a source said @entity4 communities secretary @entity3 is being compared to a private investigator no one can accuse communities secretary @entity3 of not taking his job seriously			1
while most ministers seem content with shaping national policy , mr @entity3 took direct action when he saw a group of travellers heading towards his constituency			1
he gave chase in his car and bravely confronted them after they pulled on to a cricket pitch			1
mr @entity3 – who has brought in a raft of measures aimed at preventing itinerants from setting up camp on greenfield land without permission – first noticed their convoy turning off a motorway as he drove towards his home			1
he then followed them and watched as the 40 travellers with their 15 caravans moved on to the cricket pitch at around 10pm last thursday			1
the minister pulled over and asked them what they thought they were doing			0
unhappy with their answers , he then called in the police and local council to deal with them			0
one @entity4 source said the minister ’s actions had led to @entity45 wags comparing him to a private investigator			2
he said : ‘ we ’re calling him @entity49			0
people in @entity51 know you do n’t mess with @entity3			2
this is a great example of local people taking action			0
’ after police got involved , the travellers were issued with a @entity60 eviction notice and told to leave the field in @entity62 , @entity63			1
if they had failed to do so , they could have been hit with unlimited fines under new rules introduced by mr @entity3			1
however in an apparent act of vengeance , some of the travellers returned the next day and wrecked the cricket square , forcing @entity71 to cancel a match set for the weekend			1
witnesses said the travellers drove up and down the wicket , making hand - brake turns to wreck the grass			2
the club ’s groundsman said : ‘ it was obvious they were doing all they could to plough up the pitch and do as much damage as they could			2
‘ it was just very lucky we have n’t had rain for a while and the surface was hard			0
if we had had any rain that would have been it – it would have turned into a ploughed field			0
‘ someone had tried to dig some initials around the crease of one strip , but he had given up because the ground was too hard			0
’ last night mr @entity3 told the @entity99 : ‘ i ’m pleased that they have gone but such appalling behaviour clearly demonstrates we are dealing with a small minority of people who have no respect for the law			1
‘ this government is clamping down on unauthorised traveller sites and the public want to see fair play and planning rules properly enforced			2
‘ after seeing the trouble this has caused i ’ve never felt it more important to protect our green belt land and the communities who live in and around it			2
’ strict : @entity3 has brought in measures to stop travellers from setting up camp on greenfield land without permission @entity125 , chairman of @entity62 parish council , said £ 600 of damage had been done			1
he added that the club will close for a month and a further £ 1,500 will be spent on better security			0
‘ nothing will stop a determined effort with machinery and power cutters but we must make it harder to gain unlawful access , ’ he said			0
under the @entity139 , planning guidance on traveller sites has been tightened so that camps located in the green belt , whether they are temporary or permanent , are regarded as ‘ inappropriate development ’			0
council chiefs have also been told that they ‘ should strictly limit new traveller site development in open countryside ’ .			0

@entity4 communities secretary had 40 travellers and 15 caravans removed from @entity63 cricket pitch
@entity152 *retaliated* the next day by raking up cricket pitch with their cars
mr @entity3 is a strong *supporter* of tightening rules around *illegally* setting up camp
