by @entity0 a group of @entity3 cooks are rivalling the @entity5 's renowned frog legs by coming up with their own delicacy – the poisonous cane toad			1
the cooks have started using the legs of the pest species in six different dishes and are dubbing it the ' new feral fine food '			2
@entity15 food blogger @entity14 said the cane toad was overlooked as a food source			1
@entity15 food blogger @entity14 has started using the poisonous cane toad in her cooking ' there are just so many cane toads it is mind boggling , but they are also surprisingly easy to catch , ' ms @entity14 , who is part of the @entity20 blog , said			1
' the most humane way reported is to catch them by the back legs and whip them into a dark airtight canoe bag , you do n't want to stress them out			0
' ms @entity14 's blog – growing and @entity33 – is part of a community project that focuses on using locally grown foods			1
the @entity20 team are the ones behind the cane toad leg recipes			2
the cane toads are killed by freezing them before cutting off their legs the legs of the cane toad are then skinned to rid it of its poisonous skin ms @entity14 has experimented with a number of recipes including marinating the toad legs in soy , garlic , ginger and chilli ingredients 8 toads legs with skins removed 2 tbls butter 3 cloves of garlic @entity62 to taste 1 baguette garlic chives , finely chopped method 1			1
melt butter in a heavy based sauce pan and fry garlic until softened 2			0
add toad legs and cook in butter until tender 3			2
lightly toast the baguette 4			0
serve two toad legs on a piece of baguette 5			2
drizzle with garlic butter and garnished with chives ' i tried marinating them in soy , garlic , ginger and chilli			0
after a couple of hours in the fridge i sautéed them in sesame oil and served them with heaps of local @entity91 coriander and random salad greens , including sweet leaf and rosella leaves , ' ms @entity14 said			0
cane toads produce poison through its parotid gland and some parts of its body are poisonous for many species including humans			1
ms @entity14 said the way cane toads are killed is important because they disperse more poison when stressed			1
' so give them the most calm end possible , ' she said			0
' after you have a few pop them in the freezer			0
after sufficiently frozen thaw these guys out … ( and ) with a meat cleaver or sharp knife cut off their legs			0
' because of the fact these creatures contain poison in their back and skin , you want to skin them and avoid the upper body			0
we skinned the legs which is really easy			0
' the group experimented with cooking road kill like snakes and wallabies before turning to cane toads			1
' if you are going to try some pest management , you might as well get some protein from this unwanted visitor , ' ms @entity14 said			2
ms @entity14 runs a blog , growing and @entity33 , which has a focus on locally grown foods			1
