from @entity1 to @entity2 , the signposts all point to trouble ahead for @entity4 and their beleaguered manager @entity5			1
it will require his best win as @entity4 boss against @entity2 at the @entity10 on wednesday for @entity5 to save the club ’s @entity12 dream and , possibly , his job			1
but @entity4 set out for @entity15 on monday on the back of a dismal defeat at @entity18 and a withering assessment of their shortcomings from @entity1 ’s match - winner @entity23			1
@entity23 celebrates his sweet strike that saw @entity1 upset @entity4 on saturday @entity1 's @entity26 tackles @entity27 with the kind of physical presence he says helped them win the @entity31 accused the @entity33 champions of lacking both the appetite for a physical battle and willingness to track back and defend			1
it was something @entity1 detected when they recovered to draw 2 - 2 at the @entity38 in december and exploited again after analysing @entity4 ’s defeat at @entity40 earlier this month			1
‘ you saw it recently against @entity45 , they do n’t track back as well as they go forward so we knew we could exploit that and we did , ’ said @entity23 , who scored with the sweetest of strikes after an hour			1
‘ i think it was playing to our strengths and getting in their faces that got us the win			0
you find with the bigger teams if you get in amongst them , press them hard and tackle they do n’t really like it , and we did that			0
‘ i do n’t think @entity2 will be in their faces as much as us and playing the long balls we play , but i thought we fully deserved the victory			2
‘ we did n’t think they would play as strong a team with wednesday in mind , but obviously they came here to win and we were better than them			0
’ @entity23 drills home his left - footed shot for the famous win against a side that goes to @entity2 on wednesday city boss @entity5 is under pressure although his future will be decided at the close of the season it is not the first time @entity4 ’s work ethic has been questioned this season , but there appeared to be a deeper malaise			1
it was as bad as anything in the post-title slump under @entity82			0
they were flat , dull and at times almost uninterested			0
everything that @entity1 were n’t			2
@entity86 ’s @entity85 said it was the kind of performance that gets a manager the sack			0
no wonder @entity5 ’s agent was touting him to @entity92 last week			2
there wo n’t be any knee - jerk reactions from @entity4 , however , @entity5 ’s performance will be assessed at the end of the season			1
city prepare to kick off after conceding the first goal at @entity18 that they were unable to peg back @entity101 's attempt on goal is blocked by some desperate @entity1 defence the @entity104 could yet mastermind a recovery in @entity2 and take @entity4 into the quarter - finals of the @entity12 for the first time , having emerged from the first leg only 2 - 1 down			1
but apart from @entity111 and @entity112 this was close to the team that @entity5 is expected to put out at the @entity10 and they lost to a side battling relegation			2
instead of making up ground on @entity118 in the title race , @entity4 are now in danger of getting swallowed up in the chase for places in next season ’s @entity12 and that would test the patience of @entity5 ’s employers			1
he maintains that the situation is not as bad as the corresponding period last season when @entity4 went out of the @entity129 and @entity12 in the space of four days , losing at home to @entity132 and away to @entity2			1
the 61 - year - old said : ‘ it ’s always the case before a big game that maybe the minds are not completely on this game , ’ he said			0
‘ but i do n’t think it was a case of them not trying			0
i do n’t think @entity1 had any chances to score apart from the free - kick which led to the beautiful goal			2
‘ of course we are not doing well			0
you can see that from the amount of points we have dropped			0
the only thing i can tell you is that it ’s not down to the effort of the players			0
they want , but maybe they ca n’t at the moment			0

@entity23 scored as @entity1 *toppled* @entity4 1 - 0 on saturday
the @entity31 said @entity4 were *n't* up for the physical battle and could be exploited
@entity4 go to @entity2 for the second leg of their @entity12 tie
@entity5 's side must overcome a 2 - 1 home loss to *progress*
