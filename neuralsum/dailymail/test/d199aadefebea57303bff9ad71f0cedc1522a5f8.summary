a milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the @entity2 to scrap quotas restricting production a milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the @entity2 to scrap quotas restricting production			1
the quota system was abolished today after 30 years - allowing dairy farmers to produce as much milk as they like without suffering a financial penalty			1
the move is expected to drive a spike in production , particularly in countries like @entity15 , @entity16 and the @entity17 , who plan to boost exports of milk and other dairy products to the @entity22			1
as a result , a price war over the cost of milk is likely to break out , bringing down the price for consumers			2
however , @entity30 farmers are likely to find the price they are paid by supermarkets is driven down , which will be particularly difficult for smaller family businesses			1
milk quotas were introduced in 1984 to address the oversupply during the late 1970s and early 1980s that had led to the infamous milk lakes and butter mountains			2
farmers who produced above their quota were hit with punishing cash penalties			1
the new free - for - all will promote dairy factory farms , where super-size @entity44 cows have been bred to produce more milk than any calf could drink in order to cut production costs			1
the industrialisation of dairy farming has seen the number of @entity22 farms producing milk fall from 50,000 to 14,116 over the last 30 years			2
at the same time the average herd has risen from 64 cows to 134			0
the average milk production from @entity44 dairy cows , which have been labelled ‘ udders on legs ’ , has risen by 55per cent to 7,327 litres per animal per year – around 12,900 pints			1
in some cases this has been done through selective breeding programmes designed to create supersize cows , which are bulked up with high protein feed and kept inside for much of the year in what are known as ‘ zero grazing ’ barns			0
dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint , making it cheaper than some bottled water			1
some dairy processors have starting to raise farm gate prices recently , however farmers remain concerned the end of quotas could bring enormous price swings			1
chairman of the dairy board at the @entity86 , @entity87 , has urged all @entity2 countries to act responsibly and collectively in order to manage future volatility			0
mr @entity87 said : ‘ farmers and dairy processors here do have some concerns about how other @entity2 countries will react to the ending of quotas			2
‘ some are rapidly increasing their output without an end market for these goods			0
with milk prices yet to show any strong signs of recovery , this could push farmgate milk prices down further in the @entity2 , and stall any recovery in the dairy markets			1
‘ it ’s vital that expansion in any @entity111 is planned in accordance with available market opportunities			0
’ dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint , making it cheaper than some bottled water mr @entity87 said the new freedom could allow @entity30 dairy farmers , who are particularly efficient , to win new sales in @entity126 and around the world , particularly the @entity128			1
he said : ‘ we also need @entity22 dairy processors to recognise and promote potential markets both at home and abroad and look to develop new products such as sports drinks			0
’ the idea of milk being promoted as a sports drink has been given credence by @entity139 , which has recently launched its own brand of milk in the @entity142			2
the new @entity144 milk costs more than twice as much as regular milk , but the firm believes consumers will pay more on the basis it contains 50per cent more protein and half the sugar			2
earlier this week , some @entity126 farmer groups mounted a protest over the changes outside the @entity154 in @entity155 , which involved a funeral march the lighting of a warning fire			0
the @entity159 , a federation of dairy farmers with member organisations from 13 countries , said it was likely that the market would not be able to cope with significantly expanded production in a reasonable way			1
its president , @entity167 , said the changes are a particular threat to small dairy farmers , who tend to have higher costs			2
‘ chronic price collapses are inevitable , the next crisis is on its way , ’ he said			0
‘ prices will be rock - bottom , as @entity126 ’s farmers will have even less market power to achieve a cost - covering milk price in the future			1
’ @entity180 , an mep for the @entity181 , warned about the loss of small farmers			0
‘ @entity126 could see more factory farms with 1,000 , 2,000 or even 5,000 cows , merely providing raw materials for the industry , ’ she said			0
the @entity188 , which represents milk processors , has backed the end of quotas			0
its secretary general , @entity192 , said : ‘ it goes without saying that the end of the quota will lower the administrative burden on all levels			0
this will naturally further enhance the competitiveness of the whole sector			0
’ @entity203 dairy farmers have embarked on a massive expansion plan and will be looking to make big in - roads to the @entity30 market			1
a study by the @entity208 ( @entity208 ) estimated the ending of quotas would create 9,500 extra jobs in @entity15 , and at least 1.3 billion euros ( £ 950m ) in extra exports			2
while productions restrictions have been scrapped , the @entity2 will provide a safety net for dairy farmers			0
@entity155 will have the power to buy - in butter and skimmed milk powder at a guaranteed figure if there is over-supply , which will shore up the price .			0

quota system abolished so farmers can produce as much milk as they like
production increase expected in @entity15 , @entity16 and the @entity17
could drive down prices for @entity30 farmers who are already squeezed
