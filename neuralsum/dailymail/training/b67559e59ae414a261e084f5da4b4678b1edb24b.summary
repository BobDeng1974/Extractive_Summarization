it is a gripe that frustrates subway riders daily : men with their legs splayed			1
so one woman decided to confront male commuters about the amount of space they consume			1
the investigation comes a month before @entity10 's @entity9 launches a campaign targeting ' manspreaders '			1
each man is asked if they think their own ' leg splay ' is appropriate given the people around them			0
many insist this is not normal behavior			0
one 's splay is to accommodate a bag , another is exhausted			0
a defiant passenger insists all men biologically require ample space			2
they are then asked to measure - with a measuring tape - the appropriate amount of space allotted for a considerate ' manspread '			2
that is where the results differ - from six inches to 18			0
measure it up : handed a measuring tape , each man was asked to determine how wide is appropriate different opinions : each man came up with a different measurement for inner leg to inner leg distance explanation : they each had ideas about when it was and was n't appropriate to ' manspread ' biology : one man insisted it is biologically mandatory that men sit with their legs splayed is it a problem ? some insisted nobody around them appeared ' squished '			1

@entity9 will next year target ' manspreaders ' asking them to be considerate
woman questions men spreading their legs on the subway
they give very different answers about how many inches one can spread
