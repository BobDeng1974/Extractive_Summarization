i ’m satisfied it was impulsive and i believe you have become sexualised by your exposure to and the corruption of pornography			0
‘ your exposure at such a young age has ended in tragedy			0
it was the fault of the world and society			0
’ the schoolboy , who can not be named for legal reasons , attacked his victim in december after being paid £ 10 to take care of the girl , who lived in a neighbouring house near @entity85			2
