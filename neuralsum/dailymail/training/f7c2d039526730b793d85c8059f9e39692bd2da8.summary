shoppers have been warned about the dangers of buying budget car seats online after it was revealed one model was available to buy through @entity5 despite failing every single @entity7 safety test			1
the @entity9 car seat was supplied directly from @entity10 but could be bought by @entity7 customers via @entity5 , and can be shipped over to this country via several other sites			1
that is despite the seat being outlawed for failing all the safety tests required for a seat to be sold in this country , putting children at risk of being killed			0
the @entity9 car seat was available to buy on @entity5 's @entity7 site despite being outlawed in this country for failing every single crash test rather than being made from a hard casing like most @entity7 approved car seats , the @entity9 seat was made of nothing more than fabric			1
it also has four straps attaching it to the car seat , which violates @entity7 regulations stating that every seat must have only one catch to release it so it can be removed from a car quickly after a crash			1
in order to be sold in the @entity7 car seats must pass two crash tests , one front - on at 30mph , and another from the rear at 20mph			1
crash dummies are strapped into the seats and sensors are used to measure damage , which must be below certain levels			0
passing such tests will allow a seat to go on sale in this country , but road safety groups will usually carry out additional tests before giving each seat a rating			0
a trading standards at @entity56 council said : ' foreign companies with no @entity59 presence are increasingly advertising in the @entity7 and shipping direct to customers			2
rather than a hard casing the @entity9 was made only from fabric and is held down by four straps despite regulations stating seats must have a single release strap so they can be removed from cars quickly ' such companies are incredibly difficult to regulate as they are not subject to @entity7 law			1
' we are aware of similar car seats that have been tested and this has shown that they provide totally inadequate protection and i have no doubt that in a car accident there is a strong possibility that any child in one would be killed			0
' @entity83 , spokesperson for road safety charity brake , said : ' child seats are subject to strict safety standards for a reason , and can save a child 's life in the event of a crash			2
' a child in a sub-standard seat would be at much greater risk of death or injury than if they were in a seat that meets @entity7 safety requirements			2
' we strongly advise parents to buy the safest seat available			0
even if it costs a bit more , it 's worth every penny to make sure your child is as safe as possible			0
