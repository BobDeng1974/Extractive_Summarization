by @entity0 three - year - old @entity1 looks sombre as he plays in his enclosure at @entity3 , in @entity3 , @entity4			2
indeed , despite his carefree age , the baby orangutan has lately had little joy in his life			0
just last week he was found , along with his brother @entity9 , languishing alone in the wild			1
the pair had been separated their mother in @entity14 , a vast expanse of supposedly protected tropical rainforest on the east coast of @entity18			1
@entity1 , a three - year - old @entity20 orangutan , plays in his enclosure at @entity3 after being rescued from the wild the young orangutan looks pensive as he gets used to his new environment just five days after he and his brother were found alone in @entity14 @entity1 and his brother were found separated from their mother , who may have been killed while clearing forest for palm oil plantations @entity1 stares into the distance from his enclosure at the @entity3 , where he and his brother have been treated for various injuries the centre for @entity33 says that many of the orangutans it rescues are orphans whose mothers have been killed by loggers they were in a malnourished and in critical condition when they were rescued by wildlife conservationists from the @entity32 , with wounds mainly to their feet and hands			1
now they are being nursed back to health , but the pair - like all @entity18 's orangutans - face an uncertain and difficult future			1
deforestation on the island has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of orangutans , says @entity52			0
as loggers move in to clear a path for palm oil plantations , they often slaughter orangutans they come across			1
many of the animals the group rescues are severely traumatised orphans whose mothers have been shot and hacked to death with machetes			0
@entity1 appears a little more cheerful as he plays with netting installed in his enclosure as a diversion for the captive orangutans damai with his brother @entity9 , who was found with him			1
the pair were malnourished and in a critical condition when they were picked up now they are being nursed back to health , but the pair - like all @entity18 's orangutans - face an uncertain and difficult future the brothers cuddle while playing on the net hammock in @entity3 's orangutan enclosure deforestation on the island of @entity18 has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of orangutans , says the @entity32 many of the animals the group rescues are severely traumatised orphans whose mothers have been shot and hacked to death with machetes a keeper checks on @entity1			1
he and his brother were suffering multiple injuries to their hands and feet when they were rescued by conservationists a spokesman for @entity52 said : ' @entity52 realises the absolute vital importance of protecting rainforest – home for the orangutans and many other species of wildlife			1
as far as we know we are the only organisation in @entity4 out there every day investigating and reporting forest crimes			0
' our work takes us all over @entity101 ( @entity18 ) , documenting the devastation to forests caused particularly by oil palm companies			2
some of what we observe is ‘ legal ’ , but wrong			0
a lot of what we see is definitely illegal and we do our best to stop it			0
' we regularly file reports with our government and hold protests in @entity112 to raise awareness of the problems			0
because of what we do , we make ourselves very unpopular with the government and even some conservation organisations who prefer to remain friends with those who tear down our forest and kill orangutans			0
@entity1 and his brother are being prepared for release back into the wild some day			2
but with the world 's appetite for palm oil - widely used in the commercial food industry since the switch away from trans fats - only growing , there may not be much wild left for them to return to .			2

@entity1 and his brother @entity9 were found *wandering* alone in @entity14 on the east coast of @entity18
they were separated from their mother , severely malnourished and had suffered injuries to their hands and feet
much of @entity18 's tropical rainforests , orangutans ' *natural* *habitat* , is being cleared to meet demand for palm oil
