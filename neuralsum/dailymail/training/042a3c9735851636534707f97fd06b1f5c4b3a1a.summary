by @entity0 published : 05:02 est , 7 december 2012 updated : 17:08 est , 7 december 2012 86 - year - old @entity1 called his next door neighbours ' home in @entity4 a ' midden ' , a 14th century insult meaning dung heap , in a feud that dates back 40 years he has already been jailed for his anti-social behaviour and last year was forced to wear an electronic tag to ensure he kept the peace			1
but that did n’t stop 86 - year - old @entity1 launching yet another torrent of abuse at his long - suffering neighbours			1
the retired book - keeper was sweeping his drive when he accused @entity19 and @entity20 of living in a ‘ midden ’ – a 14th century word for a manure dump			1
of @entity26 origin , the term is still in use in @entity28 and the @entity29 where it refers to anything that is a mess			0
@entity1 also called his 66 - year - old neighbours – who were filming him with a camcorder – ‘ scumbags ’			1
his actions resulted in him breaking the restraining order the couple had taken out against him			1
@entity1 was first handed an order in 1998 which banned him from contacting the couple			1
tensions have grown during the five decades they have lived next - door to each other in a cul - de - sac in @entity44 , @entity4			0
he has breached the order eight times , resulting in a further three convictions and was jailed in 2001 and tagged last year			1
the court at the time of the jail sentence heard how @entity1 plagued the lives of families he thought did not keep their homes up to scratch			1
he has now been found guilty of breaching the order again after he hurled abuse at his neighbours on may 7			1
@entity4 magistrates deferred his sentence for six months			0
@entity1 admitted shouting at @entity59 and @entity60 , but said he had been provoked by them filming him			1
in his defence , he said : ‘ they are plaguing my life with the camera			0
i was just out trying to make my place look nice			0
@entity20 and husband @entity19 have been victims of a 40 year campaign of harassment by neighbour @entity1 , which saw him jailed in 2001 and electronically tagged last year ‘ she came out and said she had me locked up before and would do again			1
‘ she said we were snobs and no one liked us and we should just leave			0
i called them scumbags in response to that			0
’ after seeing a video of the rant and hearing from other neighbours who watched the exchange , magistrates found he had no excuse for the insults he directed at the couple			2
chairwoman of the bench @entity89 said : ' we believe it has been proved that you breached the order			2
@entity4 magistrates watched a video of @entity1 's rant and found he had no excuse ' and we are satisfied that evidence we heard from @entity59 and @entity60 and the other neighbours was credible			1
' we do not accept you had reasonable grounds to breach the order and therefore find the case proved beyond all reasonable doubt			2
" instead of sentencing @entity1 straight away , the magistrates deferred the sentence for six months and he will be back at the court on may 1			1
mrs @entity89 added : ' during that time , we expect you to keep away from your neighbours			2
' speaking after @entity1 ’s latest conviction , @entity59 and @entity60 said they wanted to call an end to their feud			1
the couple said they had lived in fear of their neighbour since moving into their home in 1970			2
mrs @entity20 said : ‘ all we want to do is to be able to enjoy our lives in peace			0
' we have been here before			0
' he has been to jail and had a curfew and been warned by judges about his behaviour , but it has n't stopped him			0
' the couple say they have lived in fear of their neighbour since moving into their home in @entity133 , @entity44 , in 1970			2
a ' midden ' is a @entity136 term deriving from the @entity26 word ' mykdyngja ' which literally translates as ' manure pile '			1
the term ' midden ' is commonly used by archaeologists to describe any kind of feature containing waste products relating to day - to - day human life			2
the @entity149 midden , on @entity147 , is a famous example of a large @entity152 midden mound contains numerous discrete layers of flint , charcoal , bones , pottery and excrement			2
the couple have tried to sell their £ 200,000 home three times , but the buyers have pulled out each time after hearing about @entity1			1
@entity1 also claims to have tried to sell his home but neither family have managed to move			1
mrs @entity166 added : ' no one wants to live next to a man like him			0
he would have a better chance of selling the house			0
' there have been sale signs up twice but i do n't think he will move really			0
i do n't mind him living there , as long as he keeps out of our way			0
' he can sweep his yard , walk past our house and do whatever he likes - as long as it does n't involve us			0
' we do n't bother him , so why should he bother us			0
' he said we should n't film him but i only do that when he starts harassing us , mit is the only way to prove what he is like			0
' @entity1 , who lives with wife @entity186 in the @entity187 , said he has listened to the magistrates and will do his best to keep the peace			2
speaking after the case , he said : ' i have got to accept the court 's decision and do as they say			0
' i will keep myself to myself and keep out of their way			0
