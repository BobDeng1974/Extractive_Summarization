by @entity0 a father still grieving over the death of his daughter last year in a car accident received a letter addressed to ‘ daughter killed in car crash			1
’ @entity8 , of suburban @entity9 , received the shocking letter thursday from @entity11			1
the insensitive addressee was on the second line , under his name			0

horrifying : @entity8 received this letter addressed to ' daughter killed in car crash ' the devastated father told the station he thinks about his daughter ’ 10,000 times a day , ’ and wanted to know why the office supply chain had such personal information			1
‘ why would they have that type of information ? why would they need that ? ’ he asked			0
‘ what purpose does it serve anybody to know that ? and how much other types of other information do they have if they have that on me , or anyone else ? and how do they use that , what do they use that for ? ’ mr @entity8 debated on @entity49 about to handle it before calling the @entity11 call center , they disregarded his complaint			2
still grieving : mr @entity8 said he still thinks about his daughter 10,000 times a day tragedy : @entity15 , 17 , died last april when she lost control of her suv and hit a tree all that was left : the suv was barely recognizable ‘ the manager [ said ] that it was impossible , that this ca n't be happening , ’ he recalled			1
a subsequent follow - up by @entity20 led to @entity11 blaming the disturbing mailing on a ‘ third - party mailing list provider			1
’ the company also apologized in a statement			0
‘ we are deeply sorry that mr. @entity8 and his family received this mailing from us , and we are reaching out to mr. @entity8 to convey our sincerest apologies on this unfortunate matter , ’ the statement said			0
‘ based on a preliminary investigation today we believe this to be an inadvertent error ; and we are continuing the investigation			0
’ that explanation brings little comfort to mr @entity8 , who told the station the letter made him feel victimized .			0
