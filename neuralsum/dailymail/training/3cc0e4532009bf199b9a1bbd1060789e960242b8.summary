@entity58 rioters in @entity6 attack the @entity59 in december 1978 the @entity0 embassy in @entity6 has long been the centre of tensions between the @entity0 and @entity2			1
in november 2011 , under hardliner @entity64 's presidency , @entity2 announced it was expelling the @entity0 's ambassador in retaliation for @entity0 support for tougher sanctions on @entity6 over its nuclear programme			1
hundreds of protesters stormed embassy compounds two days later , smashing windows , torching cars , burning @entity74 , and chanting : ' the embassy of @entity0 should be taken over ' , ' and ' death to @entity77 '			0
the riots had echoes of an uprising in 1979 uprising when the pro-western pahlavi dynasty was deposed and replaced with a theocratic regime			0

one hostage was killed and two were injured			0
it was eight years before the @entity0 government re-opened its embassy in @entity6			2

it took a decade for the embassy to be reopened			0
today he announced said the ' circumstances are right ' to restore the diplomatic base after a significant thawing in relations over recent months			0
' our two primary concerns when considering whether to reopen our embassy in @entity6 have been assurance that our staff would be safe and secure , and confidence that they would be able to carry out their functions without hindrance , ' mr @entity7 told @entity125 in a written statement			1
' there has never been any doubt in my mind that we should have an embassy in @entity6 if the circumstances allowed			0
' @entity2 is an important country in a volatile region , and maintaining embassies around the world , even under difficult conditions , is a central pillar of the @entity0 's global diplomatic approach ... ' i have therefore now decided the circumstances are right to reopen our embassy in @entity6			1
' however , the @entity0 remains concerned about @entity2 's nuclear programme and its sponsorship of terrorism			0
@entity143 later rejected the idea that the diplomatic rapprochement was connected to the crisis in @entity23			0
speaking at a press conference in @entity148 , he said : ' @entity0 believes in and i believe in step by step building our relationship with @entity2 because we need to have proper dialogue with that country			0
' we are having dialogue over the nuclear weapons issue and i think we should be having dialogue with it on issues of regional security , ' the premier said			0
' obviously our relationship was at a low point after the appalling things that happened with respect to our embassy , but it is right step by step with a clear eye with a hard head , to rebuild that relationship			0
' now we would be doing that anyway irrespective of what is happening in @entity23 , but i think what is happening in @entity23 is certainly not a reason for not taking that step			0
' it came amid reports that @entity6 is considering military support to the @entity181 - led administration in @entity23			2
representatives of @entity2 and the @entity184 powers met in @entity185 to discuss international concerns about @entity6 ’s nuclear ambitions			2
in the @entity190 yesterday , @entity189 ’s shadow foreign secretary @entity188 said : ‘ there is now an urgent case for ensuring an effective @entity0 diplomatic presence in @entity6 to help co-ordinate discussions and to advance dialogue			1
’ mr @entity7 said he had discussed ' a number of matters , including the situation in @entity23 ' with @entity2 counterpart mr @entity49			1
@entity0 has not had a diplomatic presence in @entity6 since 2011 , when an angry mob ransacked offices and carried away a royal coat of arms the anti-british protests saw flags burned in the street outside the embassy in november 2011 mr @entity7 spoke to @entity2 foreign minister @entity49 on saturday to discuss taking further steps on improving bilateral relations ' he said that there was a case for a further step forward in our bilateral relations			1
' i have discussed that with him , and i shall have something more to say about our discussions imminently , ' mr @entity7 told @entity125			0
' however , our work on that is distinct from discussions on @entity23 , which is partly why i shall address those separately			0
' meanwhile , @entity13 secretary of state @entity14 has indicated that the @entity18 administration is willing to talk with @entity2 over the deteriorating security conditions in @entity23			1
the president announced last night that around 275 @entity13 military personnel could deploy to @entity23 to provide support and security for the @entity13 embassy and its staff in @entity38			1
mr @entity14 said in an interview with @entity232 that @entity233 is ' open to discussions ' with @entity6 if the @entity2 can help end the violence and restore confidence in the @entity23 government			1
he said he would not rule out military co-operation , and a senior @entity13 official revealed @entity13 and @entity2 diplomats have already discussed the @entity23 issue during nuclear talks in @entity243			1
mr @entity14 said : ' we 're open to discussions if there is something constructive that can be contributed by @entity2 , if @entity2 is prepared to do something that is going to respect the integrity and sovereignty of @entity23 and ability of the government to reform			2
' on military co-operation , mr @entity14 said : ' at this moment , i think we need to go step - by - step and see what in fact might be a reality			0
but i would not rule out anything that would be constructive in providing real stability , a respect for the constitution , a respect for the election process and a respect for the ability of the @entity23 people to form a government that represents all the interests of @entity23			0
' we are open to any constructive process here that would minimise the violence			0
' but the @entity272 says it has no plans to co-ordinate with @entity2 on possible military action in @entity23 despite mr @entity14 's comments about engagement with @entity6			1
in a sign of @entity2 's deepening involvement in the @entity23 crisis , the @entity277 reported the commander of the country 's elite @entity282 is helping @entity23 's military and @entity181 militias respond to the insurgency			2
the @entity2 general @entity287 , has been consulting in @entity23 on how to roll back the @entity289 breakaway group , according to @entity23 security officials .			2
