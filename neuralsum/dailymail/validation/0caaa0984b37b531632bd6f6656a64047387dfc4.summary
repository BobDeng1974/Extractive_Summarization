@entity0 said young people were facing ' unimaginable ' pressure from threats such as revenge porn and cyberbullying teachers are to be issued new guidance this week to help children cope with the ‘ unimaginable ’ pressures of the modern digital age , including cyberbullying , sexting and ‘ revenge porn ’			1
education secretary @entity0 said last night that @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 ( @entity15 ) lessons needed to be improved – and placed at the heart of the curriculum – to give young people the tools to cope with these growing demands			1
children will also be taught about consensual sex to help vulnerable girls ‘ spot , report and tackle abuse ’			0
mrs @entity32 , addressing the @entity30 think - tank , @entity31 , said the new guidance will be published later this week , in conjunction with the @entity34			0
she added : ‘ let ’s be clear , the internet and advance of the digital age are things to celebrate and to embrace			0
but let us not deny they bring new pressures that require new responses			1
‘ the pressures young people face today were unimaginable to my generation			1
’ mrs @entity32 highlighted research that showed two in three 11 to 16 - year - olds reported having friends who had been bullied online			0
she said the bullying can take many forms but there were increasing incidents of abuse , sexting and so - called ‘ revenge porn ’			0
she added : ‘ the evidence base is still small but in a survey conducted last year , just eight police forces reported 150 allegations relating to revenge porn over a two - year period			0
’ explaining the focus on teaching about sexual consent , mrs @entity32 said : ‘ in this modern world where many young women , and for that matter many young men , are exposed to so many pressures day in and day out , surely we have a duty to make sure they know they can say no and know how to do it			1
‘ it does mean telling young people the difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship , about when something crosses the line , what they can do about it			1
’ ms @entity32 said lessons on how to deal with these new online threats , in addition to teching on safe realtionships , needed to be made ' central ' to the curriculum ( file image ) ‘ if the revelations of recent weeks have shown us anything it ’s that the stakes are too high to let our young people leave school without this knowledge			1
‘ i do n’t pretend for one minute that lessons on consent would have been enough to stop the horrific abuse in @entity100 or @entity101			2
' but i will not rest until i know that we have done everything we can to arm young women and particularly the most vulnerable young women with the information they need to spot , report and tackle abuse			2
’ mrs @entity32 said she was concerned that children were growing up in a world that places ‘ huge value on style and arguably not always as much value on substance ’			0
she added : ‘ the democratisation of communications opens the world up but brought its own pressures too			2
' in research conducted at the start of this year , a third of 11 to 16 - year - olds said they felt the pressure to update their social media profiles with pictures or postings that make them look good			0
’ it has already been revealed that schools are to teach pupils as young as 11 about rape and consensual sex .			2
