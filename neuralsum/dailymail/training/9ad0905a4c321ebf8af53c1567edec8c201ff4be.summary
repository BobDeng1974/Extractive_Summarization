however , for the time being , @entity12 will now remain at @entity21 in @entity22			1

however last year doctors concluded miss @entity179 was suffering from @entity181 disorder , a psychological condition that causes sufferers to feel pain , although there is no physical cause for it			1
sufferers do not feign the physical symptoms they feel , rather they present themselves as the result of mental strain			1
doctors can not identify the sources of patients ' pain and instead prescribe anti-depressants			2
