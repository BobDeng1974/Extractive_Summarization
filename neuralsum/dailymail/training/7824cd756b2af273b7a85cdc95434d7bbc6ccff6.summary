by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 so , they have missed out on the first piece of silverware of the year			0
a last minute goal , scruffily conceded from a set piece , would suggest @entity7 was left tearing his hair out on a sultry night in @entity9			2
if anything , the opposite was true			0
@entity13 's manager will not be losing any sleep after @entity16 's late own goal clinched the grandly - named @entity17 for @entity18 and for good reason			1
@entity13 's squad took a step closer to full fitness and a classy performance from @entity24 augers well for the future			0
@entity26 may be mourning the departure of one sumptuously gifted @entity28 but there is no doubt @entity24 has the ability to fill @entity33 's void and cement his place in @entity13 affections			0
@entity36 won : former @entity38 man @entity37 celebrates , but it was @entity16 with the last touch full - blooded : @entity41 ( right ) goes in hard on @entity42 in the first - half wing play : new signing @entity45 floats the ball in from the left for @entity13 @entity13 : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity42 , @entity54 , @entity24 , @entity55 , @entity45 , @entity56 subs : @entity58 , @entity16 , @entity59 , can , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 @entity18 : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity41 , @entity74 if there was concern for @entity7 from the game , it was the shoulder injury to @entity55 that curtailed his night after just nine minutes but , that apart , this was just the kind of work out @entity13 were looking for			1
and , with key performers such as @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 to slot in - plus the imminent arrival of @entity83 to provide more forward options - it was no surprise to see @entity7 make the post match lap of the pitch sporting a relaxed smile			0
results do not matter at this stage of the campaign , it is about making sure preparations go smoothly and since they have been in the @entity98 , @entity13 's have gone like clockwork			0
another step forward will now be essential when they face @entity101 in @entity102 on sunday in the @entity103			0
@entity7 ' team stepped up on their opening friendly performances against @entity106 and @entity107 with a more accomplished workout against the classy @entity109 , for whom @entity69 was making his first appearance			2
men at the top : @entity7 , @entity113 and owner @entity114 before kick - off in @entity9 eye on the ball : @entity56 attempts to get the ball under control in front of the @entity120 scoreboard novelty : fans in the stands at @entity124 were in good voice despite a lacklustre opening it was a tight game , one that looked destined to be decided by a penalty shootout but in the dying moments , substitute @entity37 ’s header took a big deflection off @entity16 , wrong - footing @entity13 keeper @entity49 and securing the win for @entity18			1
@entity69 , as you would expect , cruised through this contest for the time he was on and while he was booed by a small pocket of @entity13 fans , he was involved in the best scoring chance of what was sterile first 45 minutes			2
with the pitch hard and the temperature high , neither team was in a hurry to press and press as they would normally but in the 33rd minute , @entity69 scampered down the left - flank to catch @entity147 ’s pass and , typically , he produced a perfect cut back			1
marshaled : @entity56 competes with former @entity149 and @entity150 star @entity69 @entity151 hoping for fresh start at @entity18 something new : new recruit @entity153 is tacklied by @entity154 new start : a rather shocked - looking @entity69 on the ball for @entity18 unfortuately for @entity69 , @entity41 , the veteran striker , slightly mistimed his run and he only succeeded in making a connection with his knee , sending the ball fizzing past the wrong side of @entity49 ’ right - hand post			1
@entity13 had offered little in the opening half , other than shot from outside the area that @entity24 dragged wide but , after the break , they were a different proposition and dominated the game in terms of chances created and possession			0
@entity24 , a surprising omission from @entity174 ’s @entity173 squad , was the reason @entity13 were able to wrestle back the initiative , his dancing feet and elusive movement carrying him beyond challenges and into the areas that matter			0
blessed with energy and vision , he has all the attributes needed to flourish in the @entity184 and with @entity33 now gone , the stage could be set for @entity24 to step up a level and become a star in his own right			0
he created @entity13 ’s best chance in the second period when he slipped a ball into @entity45 ’s feet but the @entity150 striker ’s powerful shot after 56 minutes was beaten away by @entity18 keeper @entity195			1
injury concern : @entity55 holds his shoulder and receives treatment after falling awkwardly trouble : the injury could come as a blow to @entity13 's attempts to sell @entity55 to @entity202 a raft of substitutions from both sides disrupted the flow of the contest from then – @entity24 was given a standing ovation when his time was up – on but the injury to @entity55 aside , @entity7 had reason to be satisfied , not least when he thinks back to his last visit to @entity124 two years ago			1
@entity18 were the opposition back then and they ran out comfortable 2 - 1 winners , illustrating that @entity7 had a significant amount of work to do to implement his vision and get @entity13 , who had just finished eighth , in a position to challenge again			2
@entity37 ’s header ensured another defeat at this famous old stadium but @entity7 has confidence that @entity13 will again be a match for the best around and , with another three weeks to hone their game , they should be in shape for when it matters on august 17 against @entity228			1
head up : @entity50 ( left ) gets in front of @entity18 's @entity74 in the first - half attack : defender @entity53 escapes two @entity18 players as he ventures down the wing colour : @entity124 was a sea of red as @entity13 fans piled in to the baseball stadium to see their side shielded : @entity18 's @entity147 ( left ) keeps the ball from @entity243 line up : @entity13 's starting xi for the friendly against @entity18 in @entity9 preparation : @entity13 players warm up prior to the friendly at @entity124 in @entity9			1

@entity16 deflects in @entity37 's header in the 90th minute
@entity55 goes off holding shoulder in the first - half after awkward fall
@entity45 tests *goalkeeper* with fizzing effort in second period
first - half of few chances at @entity124 baseball stadium in @entity9
@entity149 and @entity150 defender @entity69 starts for @entity18
