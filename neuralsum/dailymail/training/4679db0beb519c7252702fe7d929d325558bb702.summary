by @entity0 @entity1 is demanding that 26 police forces across the @entity3 should have access to the personal details of every motorist in @entity7			1
so far home secretary @entity8 is yet to implement the diktat @entity1 is demanding that 26 police forces across the @entity3 should have access to the personal details of every motorist in @entity7			1
the government is being threatened with fines totalling millions of pounds unless it obeys the ‘ orwellian ’ edict			0
foreign police also want open access to the @entity7 ’s national dna database and fingerprint records so they can check them against crime scenes and camera footage			1
mps and civil liberties groups fear identity mistakes will lead to @entity7 being accused of crimes they have not committed			1
but there is particular alarm at the idea of overseas police having access to information about every registered driver in the @entity7			1
the @entity33 database contains details of 38million drivers			0
if foreign police give the @entity7 authorities a single wrong digit from a number plate – or if criminals have cloned a @entity7 registration – then the officers would be given names , addresses , purchase details and a wealth of other personal information on the wrong suspect			1
motorists could then face a lengthy ordeal to prove their innocence			0
there are fears that , once a foreign force has the @entity33 data , it could fall into the wrong hands or be ‘ lost ’			0
concerns have also been raised about checks against @entity7 ’s dna database , which is the largest in the world			1
some @entity3 countries have worryingly high error rates when it comes to checking dna samples			0
@entity67 rules allow police to conduct tests of a lower quality than are permitted in @entity7			2
academics in the @entity72 , which has been running the scheme for four years , found that two - thirds of ‘ matches ’ at the lowest level wrongly identified an innocent person as a genetic match			0
the nightmare scenario could see a @entity80 placed under a @entity81 and bundled off to another country before they can prove mistaken identity			0
@entity84 quietly signed @entity7 up to the regime , known as the @entity86 , in 2008 , and it was supposed to come into force at least two years ago			2
foreign police also want open access to the @entity7 's national dna database and fingerprint records so they can check them against crime scenes and camera footage but home secretary @entity8 – concerned about civil liberties and handing too much power to @entity1 – is yet to implement the diktat			1
according to @entity100 papers seen by the @entity101 , this has angered the @entity102 , who are now threatening to issue @entity7 with ‘ infringement proceedings ’ if it does not obey by the end of 2014			2
the ultimate sanction is a fine issued by the @entity108			0
the minimum is £ 7.5million for each ruling against the @entity7			2
the @entity100 report admits : ‘ a considerable number of member states consider that the matching rules , in particular for dna data , are not fully satisfactory and should be designed in a better way so as to avoid matches that are identified as false upon subsequent verification			0
’ but it then goes on to say there should be no excuse for @entity7 and a small number of other member states who are resisting implementing the regime			2
last night @entity127 mp @entity126 , who unearthed the @entity100 ’s report , called the scheme ‘ orwellian ’			0
he said : ‘ it beggars belief that in the same report that acknowledges the vulnerability of the regime to mistakes and serious risks of overloading national systems , the @entity100 is threatening to fine @entity7 and other member states for not doing its bidding			1
this reckless scheme is a disaster waiting to happen			0
‘ the risks of data - sharing on such a massive scale have not been addressed , especially given the potential for innocent people to be caught up in the investigations of foreign authorities , and the risk of criminals gaining fraudulent access to such information			2
’ supporters of the treaty argue that it will help to fight cross-border crime			0
they say @entity7 police will get access to information on foreign suspects living in the @entity7			1
innocent @entity7 may suffer because of errors by foreign police			1

foreign police also want open access to the @entity7 ’s national dna database
but @entity168 and civil liberties groups fear identity mistakes will lead to @entity7 being wrongly accused of crimes
