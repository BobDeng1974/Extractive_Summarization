by @entity0 for @entity1 a racial row has gripped an @entity4 college campus where a sorority sister on saturday posted a photo on @entity7 with a racist message bragging that their chapter had no black women			1
' @entity12 go no n * * * * * ! ! ! ! ! ' reads the caption from a sister at the @entity4 's @entity12 sorority in @entity17			1
the responsible sister has since been kicked out of the chapter , which just that day had pledged two @entity21 women			2
scandal : this photo showing women from @entity12 's chapter at the @entity4 purportedly included a caption with the racial epithet a message appeared on the national @entity29 condemning the message on monday			1
' what was expressed is absolutely reprehensible and completely inconsistent with @entity12 's values and policies , ' said the organization 's post			1
' @entity12 took swift disciplinary action in accordance with the organization 's policies and procedures			1
' it also said that ' the @entity12 chapter at the @entity4 pledged a diverse group of young women , which included several new members who self - identified as minorities , including two @entity21 - @entity21 women			1
' that information was supported by university newspaper @entity49 , which tweeted ' [ ... ] all 16 panhellenic sororities participating in recruitment offered bids to @entity21 women			0
' sisterhood : two african - americans reportedly pledged @entity12 at the @entity4			2
the sorority members from a previous year are seen here the woman responsible and the other sisters in the photo had yet to come forward as of tuesday , but someone took the time to anonymously email @entity63 humor blog @entity62 with denials that the poster meant to use the racist epithet at all			1
' the snap was , apparently , an auto correct from the word " ninjas " to “ n * * * * * , " ' one tipster told the website			0
' these so - called " ninjas " are , after how alabama rush works , a sorority gets stuck with girl that were n’t their top picks			2
the reason these dumb , non proofreading chi o ’s were so happy was that they got a " perfect pledge class " this rush season			0
now , do n’t get me wrong , being a part of the alabama greek system there is a tradition of racism , but it stems from alumni in sororities not usually the actives			0
' last september , @entity49 reported that black women had been systematically blocked from receiving bids from sororities at the university , calling it ' an almost impenetrable color barrier			0
' another user told total sorority move the offending image had been photoshopped			2
' whoever edited the image took the " g " from " got " and moved it into the " nj " in " ninjas " ( the story update actually makes perfect sense ) , ' the user said			0
' if you zoom in and check the kerning of the letters then you can see that the first ‘ g ’ in " n * * * * * " was stretched the make up for the wide empty space where the " n " used to be and that the second " g " was kept at the original dimensions			0
' that user also wrote ' i sympathize with the girl because it seems someone saw an opportunity to be malicious and acted upon it			0
' requests for comment to the chapter , the national @entity12 organization , and the @entity4 from @entity1 were not immediately returned .			1

a photo of *smiling* sorority sisters from the @entity4 included a caption bragging that the chapter had no black girls
@entity29 's national organization condemned the photo and said ' the woman who took the photo is no *longer* a member of the chapter '
meanwhile , others have *claimed* the photo caption may have been an *accident* , or *possibly* a photoshopped hoax
