by @entity0 published : 18:56 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 18:15 est , 1 may 2012 @entity1 was more than just a national treasure — she was one of the @entity4 crown jewels , a walloping great diamond on a firmly knotted headscarf			2
when she died in 2003 , aged 91 , one obituary summed her up perfectly as a cross between the @entity9 and a @entity11 saucy seaside postcard			2
but she was also a superb character actress and , for many , as host of @entity12 ! , the real face of sunday worship			2
treasure : @entity1 's 90 - year career was not enough for @entity18 so a decision by @entity18 to deny her the honour of a blue plaque is n’t just stuffy and pompous — it ’s downright incomprehensible			1
when the advisory panel , which includes @entity25 , former poet laureate sir @entity26 and former @entity28 chairman sir @entity27 , ruled that @entity30 ’s contribution to theatre might be forgotten in 20 years or less , they betrayed their total ignorance of a career that stretched across an incredible nine decades			1
she was eight weeks old when she made her first stage appearance in her mother ’s arms			1
‘ it was the first and only job i ever got through influence , ’ she said			2
( her father @entity39 ran the @entity40 in @entity41			2
) at the other end of her life , she played a centenarian in a @entity45 play by @entity46 , called waiting for @entity47			2
talk about a lifetime devoted to theatre : @entity30 packed enough into her career for two whole lifetimes			1
it is baffling that @entity18 ca n’t see this			2
it ’s not , after all , as if accolades were n’t forthcoming during her lifetime			1
@entity30 was made a dame in 1993 , back when the honour was reserved for theatre heavyweights such as @entity61 and @entity62			1
staying power : @entity1 and actor @entity64 at the @entity65 at @entity66 in 1965 it helped , of course , that she played the @entity9 ’s favourite character in the @entity72 ’s favourite tv show , @entity73			1
@entity30 was @entity74 , the hectoring , house - proud president of the local ladies ’ coffee morning			2
@entity30 ’s artful performance delighted in @entity74 ’s snobbish side — when there was company , her voice would lose its coarse edge and turn quite snooty			1
hugely amused , writer @entity85 was inspired to base a whole sitcom on the trait — and @entity88 in @entity89 was born			2
@entity74 ’s character was inspired by the socially anxious , lower - middle - class women whom @entity30 had observed during her early years working behind the till at the co-op in @entity41			1
she spent ten years as a cashier , working by day , acting in the evening and learning lines deep into the night			2
potential : this publicity picture of ' actress miss @entity1 ' was issued in november 1953 she never lost her sense of those humble roots			2
‘ i scrubbed my mother ’s doorstep when i was a young woman , ’ she liked to tell reporters			1
‘ now go and fetch me mink ! ’ she married @entity101 , a drummer in the theatre orchestra , in 1937 , after a four - year courtship , and their only child , a daughter called @entity105 , was born a year later			1
@entity30 always claimed that , because there were no forceps handy , the midwife used a pair of fish knives			0
in later life , her son - in - law was the crooner @entity113 , and she visited her daughter ’s family in @entity117 at least two dozen times			1
she was never tempted to make a home in @entity120 , though			0
‘ there ’s no corner shop , love , ’ she would say			1
surely the @entity18 committee can not be prejudiced against her @entity126 accent and working - class humour ? legends : @entity1 in june 1970 with comedian @entity129 who collapsed on stage during a live televised show in 1984 and soon after died it ’s true that @entity30 was salt - of - the - earth , while recent blue plaques have been awarded to the sprinkling - of - chopped - tarragon - and - a grated - truffle type : sir @entity137 , playwright of the drawing room , for example , or the aristocratic @entity141 poet @entity140			1
her rejection has provoked outrage among fans			0
@entity145 , herself a sitcom actress with strong claims for national treasuredom , called the decision ‘ imbecilic snobbery ’			1
@entity153 mp @entity152 immediately announced he would table an @entity154 in the @entity155 to force the committee to reconsider			1
but it seems unlikely to succeed : there ’s a rule applications can not be reviewed for at least ten years			1
the most puzzling aspect is that @entity30 ’s case met the criteria of @entity163 ( sorry , @entity18 )			1
the rules state that to be considered blue - plaque - worthy , a person has to have been dead for 20 years or the centenary of their birth has been passed			1
the centenary of her birth was reached last year , on may 28 : she would be 101 this month			0
she had lived and worked in @entity171 , moving there when the musical hall star @entity173 asked her to audition for a film with him at @entity176 , during the @entity177 in 1941			0
she did n’t get the part , but the test led to a 1942 film called @entity181 , opposite comedian @entity182			0
incidentally , @entity182 has got a blue plaque , so has the film ’s producer , @entity184			1
and she died at @entity186 , a retirement home for actors in @entity171			0
@entity1 is so much a part of her adopted city that she is one of the few actors to have inspired a piece of @entity193 rhyming slang			0
popular : @entity1 pictured in 1987 when she was starring in long running @entity4 sitcome @entity73 which went for 31 series @entity197 students who scrape through their exams are said to get a @entity1 — or third , as in third - class degree			0
if that seems disrespectful , you should hear the stories @entity30 liked to tell about herself			0
@entity46 noted one of her favourites in his diary — she claimed that when she was a girl growing up next - door to the theatre in @entity41 , an alley ran along the back where the seaside town ’s only lady of the night , miss @entity210 , would take her clients			1
one night , @entity30 heard a man ’s complaining voice : ‘ @entity215 , i wish you ’d stop nodding your head			1
’ ‘ i ca n’t help it , ’ @entity215 replied			0
‘ you ’ve gone and got tangled in me scarf			0
’ it ’s not the sort of tale @entity30 would have told on @entity221 ! — the sunday evening collection of viewers ’ favourite hymns she hosted , which ran for 17 years on @entity225 in the teatime ‘ @entity228 slot ’			1
like former @entity230 entertainer @entity229 who presented @entity231 , she became an unofficial symbol of the @entity233			0
varied : @entity1 also appeared in the tv show @entity234 , set in an undertakers business , which ran from 1979 until 1986 it was no stretch to imagine @entity30 reading her @entity237 at home and being comforted by familiar verses , or being moved to tears by the plain poetry of well - loved hymns			0
each week , five million people tuned in			0
she had a wisdom in her voice that was rooted in common sense , something that audiences could recognise and cherish			0
it was that quality which @entity46 captured in his 1988 short play , @entity252 , written for @entity253			0
she played an elderly widow who had suffered a fall			0
gradually , in a monologue that becomes mumbled as her life slips away , @entity30 revealed her fall was the consequence of climbing up on to the furniture , trying to do the dusting			0
it was a portrait of abandonment and loss , depicted with such heart - rending pathos that @entity30 ’s postbag was bulging for days after the broadcast with letters from people begging her to come and live with them			1
how can @entity18 fail to see how beloved this woman was ? and why would they think she might be less warmly remembered in a couple of decades ? a look at recently approved names on plaques provides a clue : they are largely male			1
so , too , is the committee : seven of the ten , including the chairman , historian professor sir @entity278 , are men			1
@entity280 : this picture taken in 1966 shows @entity1 enjoying a night at the fashionable @entity282 in @entity171 's @entity283 plenty of plaques have been granted to actors in the past few years			0
@entity287 , a star of @entity176 comedies , was honoured with a blue plate at his @entity291 home			0
@entity287 was a lovely , lugubrious comic , but he is hardly a household name — never the star of tv ’s longest - running sitcom , for instance			1
to test the theory that there ’s a sexist bias at @entity18 , i suggested a couple of candidates — both actresses			2
one was @entity305 , the matron of the @entity306 movies			0
the other was @entity309 , the only bona fide sex - bomb of @entity4 cinema ’s golden era			2
both were younger than @entity30			0
both have been dead for more than 20 years			0
both lived and worked in @entity171			0
in other words , they meet the criteria			0
a spokeswoman for @entity18 admitted last night that neither @entity305 nor @entity309 had ever been considered			0
but for a committee that is incompetent enough to deny an honour to the @entity9 ’s favourite actress , it ’s probably not surprising			1
or as @entity30 might have said : ‘ them ’s too numb to know they are numb ! ’ @entity0 compiled @entity326 : from @entity327 ( @entity328 )			2
