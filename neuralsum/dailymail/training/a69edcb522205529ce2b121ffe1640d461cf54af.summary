click here to read sportsmail chief sports writer @entity2 's appraisal of @entity4 's loss to @entity5 at the @entity6 if it was an audition for a coaching job in @entity10 football at some point in the future , then it was a case of ' do n't call us , we 'll call you ' for @entity15 on tuesday night against @entity5			1
if there is one thing the @entity10 dislike it 's a coach who errs on the side of caution â€“ they laud those who fight fire with fire and those who first and foremost try to make themselves hard to beat are looked down upon			2
it 's one of the reasons why former @entity4 coach @entity28 has never quite enjoyed the unanimous approval of his countrymen , despite his trophy haul			0
' poor image of @entity4 , ' cries as while @entity33 praises @entity5 's ' @entity34 ' ( faultless ) on wednesday some will have understood @entity15 ' attempt at smothering @entity5 's midfield passing game but @entity37 as chief football writer @entity38 spoke for the vast majority when he wrote : ' giving up on the result from the moment of team selection was a crime against his club 's history			1
' others compared the @entity4 coach to @entity49 boss @entity48 , who had said before last weekend 's match against @entity5 : ' all i ask for is that they do n't walk all over us			1
' that seemed to be one of the motivations behind the team selection , although when respected @entity59 journalist @entity58 was asked about that comparison he said : ' yes but that was @entity49 , this is @entity4			1
' in his daily editorial @entity38 added : ' it takes two to tango and yesterday @entity4 did n't want to dance			2
even at the end when they brought on ( @entity68 ) @entity67 and ( @entity70 ) @entity69			0
they were only one goal behind still did n't really go for it			0
' @entity4 boss @entity15 did n't impress the @entity10 media on tuesday night against @entity5 @entity15 rested a number of key players , with captain @entity67 joining the action from the bench @entity15 was given 4.5 out of 10 in @entity33 's ratings			1
' the @entity4 coach prioritised the @entity81 , ' said the @entity5 sports newspaper , who ran the headline : ' little more than a friendly ' above its match report			1
there is a phrase in @entity10 football , ' @entity91 sin despeinarse ' ( ' winning without messing your hair up ' ) , that also featured in their coverage of a victory achieved with surprising ease			0
@entity15 impressed everyone in @entity10 last season with @entity4 's title charge			1
the way he took the favourite @entity104 team of so many football fans in @entity10 to within touching distance of the title will have put him on the radars of most clubs			0
even @entity110 , whose current coach @entity111 has not covered himself in glory so far , will be monitoring his progress			0
but the reaction in @entity116 to tuesday night 's showing was equally lukewarm			0
video visit the @entity118 for more @entity4 videos from the @entity6 @entity121 journalist @entity120 says @entity15 ' line - up was not ' behavior of a distinguished manager ' @entity126 journalist @entity120 wrote : ' dismissing the @entity127 and dismissing the @entity6 in such a way is not the behavior of a distinguished manager			1
' @entity15 will have the last laugh if @entity4 beat @entity133 at the weekend , and qualify for the knockout stages of the @entity127 , where he will get another chance to impress outside of @entity104			2
if that chance does not come though , then the lasting memory in @entity10 of @entity15 this season will be of a man who brought the second best team in @entity104 last season to play the third best team in @entity10 last term , and never really gave them a game			2
video we did n't need to play with intensity - @entity147			0
