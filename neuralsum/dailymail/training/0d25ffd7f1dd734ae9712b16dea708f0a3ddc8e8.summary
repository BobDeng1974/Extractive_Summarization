by @entity0 @entity1 : ' they 're getting special treatment ' gipsies who falsely accused a grandmother of racial abuse are set to be given a new caravan site at a cost to the taxpayer of more than £ 500,000			1
the move has outraged people living near what is currently tranquil farmland , with at least two imminent house sales said to have fallen through as a result			1
the council behind the proposal has already spent £ 145,000 trying to throw the group off their existing camp on green belt land			2
and the gipsy family meant to benefit from the new site have said there is no guarantee they would move there in any case			2
the plan would see taxpayers provide a new site for five mobile homes belonging to the @entity34 family			2
last year the family falsely claimed toy shop owner and community stalwart @entity1 , 78 , had called them ‘ dirty * * * * * * * gippos ’ in a row over their illegal camp			1
mrs @entity41 , a widowed former sunday school teacher , was given a criminal record after being found guilty of racially aggravated harassment , but after an 11 - month nightmare her good name was restored when a judge quashed the conviction			0
now the council has been told it must find the @entity49 a permanent site and residents of a quiet row of terraces this month learnt that farmland behind their homes had been chosen – despite being the most expensive of nine potential sites to develop , at £ 560,000			1
mrs @entity41 said : ‘ i do n’t see why they should receive special treatment like this , especially if it means another beautiful spot is spoiled as a result			2
’ the proposal has led to a campaign from residents of @entity66 , the chosen site on the edge of the @entity69 market town of @entity70			1
developing the fields - currently grazed by cattle - would require building an access road across land which is understood to have been given to the council by a former mayor for £ 1 on condition it was used to benefit the townspeople			0
@entity80 , landlord of the adjacent @entity82 pub , said : ‘ it ’s not the right place , it ’s as simple as that			0
it ’s a semi-rural location on the outskirts of town			0
all the residents around here are appalled we were not informed of this by the council even though dozens of others were consulted			2
’ the proposed site at @entity66 on the edge of @entity70 , @entity69 is currently grazed by cattle another resident said : ‘ my fear is that they wo n’t stop at five caravans , we could see other travellers stopping off there as well			1
’ @entity70 council identified nine potential sites for the @entity49 ’ five caravans and earlier this month announced that it had chosen a site known as @entity107			1
the proposal is now out for consultation			0
@entity70 council had set aside £ 145,000 to evict the @entity49 from a plot of green belt land they own less than a mile away			1
but last year it was forced to give them temporary permission to stay after the @entity116 said the council had failed to make enough provision for travellers and gipsies			0
council leader @entity121 said : ‘ time and again decisions on what ’s best for @entity70 have been taken out of our hands by the @entity116			1
’ @entity126 pictured outside @entity127 the cost of developing the site – part of a larger plot earmarked for 158 homes – comprises a new access road , hard - standing , utilities , secure fencing and a play area			0
the council may be able to claim the cost back from central government			0
despite all that , the @entity49 – who have lived in the @entity70 area for 40 years – are undecided on whether they would even move in if it went ahead			1
‘ we have n’t even seen the site yet , ’ said @entity126 , a father of three whose wife @entity144 is governor of a local school			2
‘ there ’s lots of details that would need to be ironed out			0
’ @entity150 , the @entity49 ’ planning adviser , said there was a ‘ chronic shortage ’ of official traveller accommodation , with no new sites built in @entity70 in 20 years			1
ministers introduced new rules in 2012 aimed at letting local authorities decide how to accommodate travellers			0
‘ this government has scrapped @entity162 ’s top - down targets for traveller sites , increased @entity165 protection and ripped up @entity167 ’s 200 pages of politically correct guidance , ’ local government minister @entity159 said last night			0
‘ councils now have tough new powers to stop unauthorised traveller sites to ensure fair play in the planning system			0
