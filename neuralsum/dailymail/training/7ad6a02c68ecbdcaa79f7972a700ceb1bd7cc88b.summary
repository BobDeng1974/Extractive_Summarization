president @entity0 plans to sign executive orders monday prohibiting discrimination against gay and transgender workers in the federal government and its contracting agencies , without a new exemption that was requested by some religious organizations			1
@entity0 's action comes on the heels of the @entity13 @entity12 's recent ruling in the @entity15 case that allowed some religiously oriented businesses to opt out of the federal health care law 's requirement that contraception coverage be provided to workers at no extra charge			1
senior administration officials said friday that ruling has no impact on non-discrimination policies in federal hiring and contracting			2
they spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plans publicly			0
order : @entity0 plans to sign an executive order on monday that prohibits discrimination of @entity35 federal employees since @entity0 announced last month that he would sign the orders , he 's faced pressure from opposing flanks over the religious exemption and given no indication of where he would come down			1
many religious leaders and conservative groups wanted him to exempt religious organizations from the order , while liberal clergy and gay advocacy groups adamantly opposed such an exemption			0
until last month , @entity0 long resisted pressure to pursue an executive order for federal contractors in hopes that @entity52 would take more sweeping action banning anti-lgbt workplace discrimination nationwide			1
a bill to accomplish that goal — the @entity57 — passed the @entity58 last year with some @entity60 support , but has not been taken up by the @entity60 - controlled @entity61			0
the senior officials said @entity0 's action planned for monday at the @entity61 would amend two executive orders			2
the first , signed by president @entity65 in 1965 , prohibits federal contractors from discriminating based on race , religion , gender or nationality in hiring			2
@entity0 plans to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of protections , and order the @entity76 to carry out the order			1
the officials said that means the change will probably take effect by early next year			0
identity : @entity0 will also amend a @entity84 - era anti-discrimination law to include gender identity as a protected class president @entity87 had amended @entity65 's order in 2002 to allow religious groups to hire and fire based upon religious identity			2
churches also are able to hire ministers as they see fit			0
the senior administration officials said @entity0 will not change those exemptions			0
the second order @entity0 will amend was signed by president @entity84 in 1969 to prevent discrimination against federal workers based on race , religion , gender , nationality , age or disability			1
president @entity105 added sexual orientation , and @entity0 will include gender identity in a change to immediately take effect			2
@entity111 president @entity110 said : " with two strokes of a pen , the president will have a very real and immediate impact on the lives of millions of @entity35 people across the country			1
" religion : the order follows the @entity15 ruling , which allowed businesses to opt out of the federal health care mandate for religious reasons the administration officials said the change for federal contracting will impact some 24,000 companies with 28 million workers , or one - fifth of the @entity13 workforce			1
many large federal contractors already have employment policies barring anti-gay workplace discrimination , as do 21 states			0
however , the @entity135 at @entity135 estimates that the executive order would extend protections to about 14 million workers whose employers or states currently do not have such nondiscrimination policies			0
while few religious organizations are among the biggest federal contractors , they do provide some valued services , including overseas relief and development programs and re-entry programs for inmates leaving federal prisons .			0

the order will protect federal workers and employees at companies that contract with the federal government
' with two strokes of a pen , the president will have a very real and immediate impact on the lives of millions of @entity35 people across the country , ' human *rights* activists said
