the @entity2 women ’s draw was blown wide open when top - seed @entity3 was dramatically bundled out by the unheralded @entity5 of @entity6			1
the world no 1 crumbled after a dominant start in a rain - delayed third - round clash to lose 1 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 in 124 minutes against the 24 - year - old from @entity11 , who has never made the last 16 of these championships			1
a dazed @entity5 tried to address her amazing accomplishment soon after winning and declared : ‘ i just can not believe it			1
‘ a few years ago i could n’t even play on grass , i was so bad			0
and she ’s at home here , she plays so good here			0
wow , it ’s just a dream			0
i tried to fight on every point			0
i do n’t know how i did it , just with heart			0
‘ she played very well , but i tried to focus and make sure i had nothing to regret			0
delight : @entity5 celebrates beating top seed @entity3 in the third round ‘ she helped me a bit because she made two big mistakes , she is human like everyone else and that ’s what i was thinking about			1
‘ this is the biggest upset of the tournament because she is number one and has won so many titles at @entity2			1
‘ i can not believe that it was me who did it , i ’m going to have to celebrate with my team			0
’ @entity3 has won 17 @entity52 titles but her inconsistency in the @entity54 is becoming something of a problem			2
this is the fourth time in the last five that she has been knocked out in the fourth round or earlier , and the latest upset comes barely three weeks after she was defeated in the second round of the @entity61			2
agony : @entity3 lost her way after zipping through the first hard - hitting : @entity3 plays a return to @entity5 1			1
@entity5 is 24 and comes from the @entity67 port of @entity11 , which is also her favourite city			2
the @entity6 has won four @entity71 singles titles , the most recent of which came in april in @entity73			0
@entity5 had only won one of her previous four matches against @entity3 but that also came this year in the semi-finals in @entity79			1
she went on to lose the final of that tournament to @entity3 ' sister @entity83 , who she has never beaten in four attempts			1
saturday 's victory was @entity5 's first over a top - 20 player at a grand slam and the first over a current world no 1 in her career			1
@entity5 's favourite surface is clay and she won the junior title at the @entity61 in 2007			2
@entity5 had never previously reached the fourth round at @entity2 and has never gone beyond the last 16 at any grand slam			1
the @entity6 made her senior slam debut at the @entity61 in 2005 aged just 15 , beating @entity98 in round one before losing to @entity100			0
she reached her highest ranking of 11 as a teenager in 2009 but slipped out of the top 100 in 2012 before climbing back up over the last two seasons			0
her current ranking is 24			0
@entity5 has a cat called @entity106 and a dog named @entity108 .			2

top seed *serena* lost out in three - set *thriller* at @entity2
five - time champion lost to @entity5 for second time in 2014
@entity3 and @entity83 fail to reach last 16 for first time since 2006
