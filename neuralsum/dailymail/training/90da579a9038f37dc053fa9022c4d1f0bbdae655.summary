@entity8 ( pictured ) , in the @entity7 , said teenagers sitting mock exams will have to be accompanied to the toilet block by an invigilator , and they will not be allowed to close the cubicle door the move has been condemned by angry parents , with one saying : ' this would be degrading to anyone - let alone to kids of 16 and 17			1
' it is a clear disregard for basic human rights and is downright wrong			1
' in an e-mail to parents informing them of the school 's decision , mr @entity14 said : ' we have had students attempt to cheat using phones while on toilet breaks during an exam			1
' this means that from now on , if a student does require a toilet break during an exam , they will be accompanied into the toilet area by an invigilator of the appropriate sex , and will not be allowed to close the door if they need to use an individual stall			2
' although this may seem a little extreme , it is the only way we can ensure a student does not use a mobile phone while in the toilet			0
' ideally , students should ensure they do not need to break their concentration by going to the toilet in the middle of the exam			0
' i know i can rely on you for support with these security measures			0
' principal @entity14 admitted that the decision was ' extreme ' but said it was ' the only way ' ( file picture ) the college has taken drastic action over fears pupils will cheat on exams by looking up the answers on their smartphones while hidden away in the toilet			1
the principle said it follows cheating last year ( file pictures ) the new rule will come into force when mock @entity80 and @entity80 exams take place later this month			0
mr @entity14 said the crackdown was an attempt to ' protect the future chances of our students '			0
he said : ' the college is implementing this toilet breaks policy during examinations to make students aware that attempting to cheat is simply not worth it			2
' a very small minority of students attempt to cheat and they use increasingly inventive and sophisticated techniques , including using mobile phones smuggled into the toilets			0
' however , the consequences of cheating are very severe because students will find themselves disqualified from that exam by the exam board , and possibly even disqualified from all their other exams too			2
' we are protecting the future chances of our students by implementing strict security measures			0
' the majority of students will not need to use the toilet during an exam , but if they do , our experienced invigilator team will supervise closely , but sensitively , to ensure that no cheating takes place			0
