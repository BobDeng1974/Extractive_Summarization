the pm knows that @entity1 ’s — the fast food chain that ’s spreading across the country like wildfire — crosses class , political and ethnic divisions forget the @entity7 , tax cuts or tv debates			1
the way to win @entity13 people ’s hearts at the next election is through their stomachs			1
when @entity17 told a hip youth radio station this week he ’d like to take world leaders to lunch at @entity21 — rather than a harvester or a @entity24 restaurant — he knew what he was talking about			1
not only has he visited a @entity27 outlet of @entity21 ’s — the fast food chicken chain that ’s spreading across the country like wildfire — but he also knows that the restaurant crosses class , political and ethnic divisions			1
whoever gets the @entity21 ’s vote at the election will sweep the nation			1
there are 333 @entity21 ’s outlets in @entity13 ; 1,000 in all , in 35 countries			1
main markets are @entity13 , @entity42 and @entity43			2
but @entity1 ’s is big in @entity44 , too			1
when president @entity45 spoke at the @entity46 in 2013 , he said of the @entity43 chain : ‘ in @entity44 , we see the reach of your culture — we ’ve got a @entity1 ’s a couple of blocks from the @entity53			1
’ what is the special ingredient that explains the chain ’s extraordinary success ? the literal answer is its peri-peri sauce			1
@entity60 — swahili for ‘ pepper - pepper ’ — originally comes from @entity63 , where the sauce was adopted by @entity66 colonials			2
the ingredients are a secret combination of hot chilli pepper , lemon , garlic , herbs and spices			0
the restaurant ’s chickens — fresh , never frozen — are trimmed of fat , marinated overnight , and regularly basted with the peri-peri sauce while being flame - grilled			1
it is n’t just the peri-peri sauce , though			1
when it opened in @entity13 in 1992 , @entity1 ’s hit the sweet spot of @entity83 dining through a combination of luck and hard - headed analysis of how to make money in the unpredictable restaurant trade			1
@entity21 ’s is a little more expensive than @entity90 ’s or @entity91 , but healthier , and far cheaper than any fancy restaurant			1
four boneless , flame - grilled chicken thighs plus rice and salad — yours for £ 10.25			2
on top of that , you get much more of a restaurant feel than the usual fast - food chains			0
a waiter shows you to your table ; you order at the counter ; the waiter brings you your food , with china plates and proper knives and forks			0
service is extremely quick — crucial in our i - want - it - now culture ; handy , too , for harassed parents with demanding children			0
‘ fast - casual dining ’ is the buzzword of the modern restaurant business , and @entity21 ’s has nailed the trend			1
there is variety on the menu : you can choose how spicy you want your chicken , from plain to extra-hot			0
and there are other dishes : veggie burgers , steak rolls , mushroom and halloumi dishes and different salads			0
but on the whole , the only big choices customers make are the size and type of the chicken portion — quarters , halves , wholes , butterfly breasts , thighs , legs , wings , chicken livers and chicken burgers — and what sauce they want			2
the prime minister posed for a selfie with @entity21 diner @entity150 after visiting the restaurant in @entity27 the prime minister tucked into half a chicken , chips , coleslaw - washed down with a glass of red wine - in a @entity21 in @entity27 last year			1
he said this week he 'd like to take world leaders for a dinner at the chicken chain the chicken is n’t quite fully free - range , but it is ‘ @entity167 ’ standard , which means it is @entity13 and approved by independent inspectors			1
some outlets are franchised ; others directly owned by the company			0
so it ’s largely chicken , chicken and more chicken			0
and that leads to low overheads , a simple supply line and very little food thrown away			0
it ’s a formula that has conquered the nation : from the pm to @entity182 , who ’s been seen in the @entity1 ’s in @entity183 — @entity185 ’s epicentre of the @entity187 world			1
the formula is also popular with young , black customers			0
the @entity191 market , too , is catered for : halal chicken is available in 50 @entity13 outlets			1
the @entity21 ’s marketing campaign is shrewd			2
the @entity199 , @entity7 workers , policemen and firemen get a 20 per cent discount			0
and the latest wheeze is the mythical @entity1 ’s @entity202 , aka the @entity203 , which entitles its exclusive owners , and four of their friends , to @entity1 ’s meals for life			1
@entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 are alleged to have a @entity203			0
rapper @entity213 and @entity215 boxer @entity214 confess to having one			0
boxer @entity217 and singer @entity218 have apparently been photographed with one			0
and @entity219 , the @entity220 chairman , says he yearns for one			0
but in a brilliant bit of marketing , @entity1 ’s refuses to admit the cards actually exist			1
so , hey presto , like @entity225 ’s @entity224 in @entity224 , the @entity203 enters the realm of dream , fantasy and magic			2
not everyone in @entity21 ’s higher echelons has cottoned on to the beauty of the myth			2
in 2013 , @entity13 marketing director @entity234 said : ‘ no gifts are given on the condition of anyone plugging us			2
it ’s just thank yous			0
’ but the co-founder of @entity21 ’s goes along with the mystery of the @entity203			1
‘ it ’s a rumour , i believe , ’ @entity243 , 55 , from @entity244 , said this week			0
‘ i have n’t got one			0
it ’s about time they gave me one			0
if it does exist , i ’d like one			0
’ @entity21 ’s keeps snowballing and plans to increase the number of @entity13 restaurants every year by 30 outlets , with the same number across the rest of the world @entity243 cooked up the whole @entity21 ’s idea in 1987 when a friend , @entity256 , took him to @entity21 , a cafe in a @entity244 suburb			1
so knocked out was brozin by the delicious chicken that he and @entity256 borrowed £ 25,000 from family and friends to buy the cafe			0
they renamed it @entity21 ’s , after @entity256			2
despite having no restaurant experience — @entity243 had failed his accountancy exams and was selling electrical goods — he had unwittingly struck gold			0
the founders quickly opened a second branch in @entity244			0
the chain retains strong @entity43 links			0
@entity274 is in charge of the @entity244 factory that produces all the company ’s peri-peri sauce			1
and there is so much @entity43 art in @entity21 ’s restaurants worldwide that the chain claims to be the number one buyer of contemporary art from that country			2
when @entity243 and @entity256 opened a third branch in @entity43 , the @entity287 family put £ 57,000 into the business			0
it was a shrewd investment : today , @entity243 and the @entity291 are the principal shareholders in the multi-million - pound empire			0
for its first 15 years , @entity21 ’s was touch and go : it often ran out of cash , and @entity243 had to go cap in hand to his bank manager to exceed his overdraft			2
between 1997 and 2003 , the company was listed on the @entity300 , but the share price never prospered			0
since @entity1 ’s has gone back into private hands , it has boomed			1
@entity243 remains chief executive , but devotes most of his time to philanthropy , while his empire goes on growing			0
the outspoken tycoon still keeps an eye on the business and ensures the company sticks to what he calls the ‘ do n’t f * * * withs ’ of the business , which include @entity21 ’s distinctive cockerel logo and the ‘ people - centric business ’			1
@entity1 ’s made a £ 58.2 million profit in @entity13 in 2013 and is expanding			1
it ’s making so much money that , some have claimed , it is legally sheltering millions in complicated offshore accounts to cut its @entity13 tax bill			2
the chain has denied this , saying it paid more than £ 12 million in corporation tax in 2013			2
still , @entity21 ’s keeps snowballing			1
it plans to increase the number of @entity13 restaurants every year by 30 outlets , with the same number across the rest of the world			1
any politician who bottles that ever - growing peri-peri magic has got the keys to @entity335 for life .			2

@entity17 told radio station he would like to take world leaders to @entity21 **'s**
he was spotted dining at @entity27 branch in may 2013 and posed for selfie
whoever get @entity1 **'s** election vote will sweep nation - there are 333 outlets
success of chicken shop is down to its secret ingredient peri-peri sauce
also has the @entity203 , which entitles exclusive owners to meals for life
@entity1 ’s made a £ 58.2 million profit in @entity13 in 2013 and is snowballing
