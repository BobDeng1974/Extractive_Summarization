by @entity0 published : 06:16 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 09:52 est , 3 may 2013 car parks in @entity2 are fast becoming the hottest place in town for archaeologists			2
following on from the discovery of the remains of @entity10 buried deep under a car park in the city , the team which worked on that astonishing find has discovered another gem - under another car park			1
experts from the @entity2 archaeological unit that unearthed the last @entity19 king , spearheaded another dig and discovered a 1,700 - year - old @entity22 cemetery with remains thought to date back to @entity24			1
archaeologists have found 13 burials , belt buckles , a ring bearing a possible @entity30 symbol and people with different beliefs were buried alongside each other a ring bearing a possible early @entity30 symbol , found by archaeologists at the site			2
experts believe it may show an @entity41 ) monogram taken from the initials of @entity43 in @entity44 researchers found 13 sets of remains of mixed age and sex , and discovered the unusual practice of @entity30 burials alongside pagan burials			1
personal items such as hairpins and belt buckles , remains of shoes , and a ring bearing a possible early @entity30 symbol were also found at the @entity60 site in @entity2 ’s historic city centre			1
in addition , the team has found a jet ring with a ' curious ' symbol etched on it , apparently showing the letters ix overlain			2
opinion as to its meaning is divided ; researchers said it may just be an attractive design but it is also reminiscent of an early @entity30 symbol known as an @entity41 ) monogram taken from the initials of @entity43 in @entity44			0
archaeological project officer @entity73 said : ' we have discovered new evidence about a known cemetery that existed outside the walled town of @entity78 during the 3rd to 4th @entity79			0
' the excavation , at the junction of @entity60 and @entity81 , lay approximately 130m outside the south gate of @entity78 , adjacent to one of the main routes into the town from the south ( @entity60 )			0
the site of newly - discovered @entity22 burials under excavation below a car park in @entity2 ' roman law forbade burial within the town limits so cemeteries developed outside the walls , close to well - used roads			1
' previous excavations on @entity81 had discovered numerous burials to the immediate east and north of the present site , all of which appeared to have been buried according to @entity30 traditions - buried in a supine position , facing east with little or no grave goods			0
' unusually , the 13 burials found during the recent excavations , of mixed age and sex , displayed a variety of burial traditions including east to west and north to south - oriented graves , many with personal items such as finger rings , hairpins , buckles and hob - nailed shoes			1
' researchers have so far found 13 burials , belt buckles , a ring bearing a possible @entity30 symbol , and found people with different beliefs were buried alongside each other mr @entity73 said the jet ring was found on a set of remains that were buried in a @entity30 tradition - facing east - and nearby was a grave that showed a possible @entity133 burial			1
this grave had a north - south orientation , he said , with the body laid on its side in a semi-foetal position , with the head removed and placed near the feet alongside two complete pottery jars that would have held offerings for the journey to the afterlife			0
he added : ' this would seem to be a very pagan burial , so it is possible from the variety of burials found that the cemetery catered for a range of beliefs that would have been important to people living in @entity2 at this time			1
' researchers said the excavations also added information to the increasingly well documented medieval southern suburb of the town , revealing remains of 12th to 13th century quarries , cesspits and rubbish pits that would have been dug in the backyards of properties fronting onto @entity60			2
mr @entity73 added : ' all of these pits contained a wealth of information from pottery , bone and environmental remains to help build a picture of medieval life in this part of the town			0
a large 17th century defensive ditch running alongside @entity81 was also discovered which was part of the town ’s defences during the @entity177			0
' the site is earmarked for development			0
to great fanfare and cheers , scientists earlier this year announced to the world that the skeleton found under a council car park in @entity2 is that of @entity10 it was , they said , a historic moment , finally ending the centuries - old mystery of what happened to the body of the last @entity19 king			1
but the best was to come			0
academics were also able to reveal details of how one of the nation ’s most controversial monarchs met his end – and how appallingly he was treated in death after defeat at the hands of @entity202 at the @entity203 in 1485			0
stripped naked with his hands tied , and scarred by multiple ‘ humiliation wounds ’ inflicted as his body was paraded through @entity2 , @entity10 was dumped in a shallow grave with no coffin or shroud			2
there his body remained until his skeleton was discovered last year following a campaign led by @entity213 , of the @entity214			0
