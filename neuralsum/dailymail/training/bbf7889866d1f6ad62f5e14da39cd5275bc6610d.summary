at least 10,000 @entity1 emigrants are enjoying life in the sun on sickness benefits of up to £ 94 a week			1
this could be costing the taxpayer almost £ 1million a week in a time of austerity			2
claimants in the @entity1 are being forced to take new tests to see if they really are as sick as they say			1
a ( taxpayer funded ) place in the sun : at least 10,000 @entity1 living overseas are enjoying handouts thanks to incapacity benefits			1
( picture posed by models ) but officials admit that 4,000 older recipients of the benefit living in @entity20 , @entity21 and elsewhere will be able to continue drawing the handout until they reach retirement age			1
this is because @entity26 ’s @entity25 will not re-test the entitlement of those reaching state pension age before 6 april 2014			2
the government is forced by @entity31 rules to pay certain benefits even if the recipients eventually move abroad			2
in addition , @entity34 has reciprocal arrangements with other countries , including the @entity38 and @entity21 , to keep up expatriates ’ handouts			2
it emerged last month that expat pensioners receive £ 13.4million a year in winter fuel payments – even though many live in sunnier climes where they seldom need to turn on the heating			2
exemptions : @entity26 has decided not to re-test the entitlement of those over 60 but the cost of incapacity payments going abroad dwarfs that of winter fuel payments – costing up to £ 49million last year			2
and even though some of the remaining 5,800 expat claimants will be reassessed , ministers will have to rely on foreign gps to carry out the assessments , raising questions over whether they will be as thorough as the independent doctors hired by the @entity25 to carry out the assessments in @entity34			2
the highest rate of incapacity benefit is £ 94.25 , meaning that up to £ 940,000 is going abroad every week to claimants			2
if the allowance was initially claimed in @entity34 , anyone is entitled to continue claiming after moving to any of 30 @entity67 countries or their overseas territories			1
under @entity67 law , benefits acquired in one member state must be paid to those who move to another			1
the deal also includes @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 – none of which is in the @entity31			0
the @entity1 also has reciprocal arrangements with some @entity83 countries			1
@entity85 backbencher @entity84 said : ‘ these figures are deeply alarming			0
huge sums of public money are going to people unjustifiably , and it is all down to @entity31 regulations			0
‘ @entity1 doctors will be strict in reassessing claimants , but we need an assurance that doctors in other countries will be just as strict			1
’ @entity99 , of the @entity100 ’ @entity98 , said : ‘ it is ridiculous that @entity31 rules prevent our government from making our own choices about whether to give benefits to those who have moved away			0
’ assessments : @entity109 claimants in the @entity1 face stringent new tests to see whether they are eligible to continue claiming			1
( picture posed by models ) ' deeply alarming ' : @entity85 backbench mps @entity84 and @entity113 both say the issue of expatriates claiming incapacity benefits must be tackled a spokesman for the @entity25 said those who are genuinely too disabled or ill to work are entitled to the new @entity120 under @entity31 rules			0
if someone from the @entity1 now living abroad has paid enough in national insurance contributions , he or she can receive contribution - based @entity120 subject to the same checks as someone living in the @entity1			1
he said : ‘ @entity126 is an outdated benefit which is now closed to new claimants			0
we are currently reassessing everyone of working age on @entity109 , whether they live in @entity34 or abroad			0
‘ people from the @entity1 living abroad will only be entitled to @entity120 if they have paid sufficient national insurance contributions			1
if they are found to be fit for work they will have their benefits stopped			0
’ he said those emigrants on @entity126 will be reassessed for @entity120 using exactly the same criteria as those in @entity34			0
the @entity25 estimates that there are around 10,000 on @entity109 abroad , the majority in @entity67 with many in @entity20 and @entity142			1
about 5,800 living overseas are expected to be reassessed for @entity120 between february 2011 and april 2014			0
as in the @entity1 , those who are approaching 60 or more will not be reassessed because they are deemed to be too old to seek work			1
@entity1 - based sickness benefit recipients will be assessed by @entity25 - approved doctors			1
but the @entity25 will have to rely on foreign gps to carry out assessments for those based abroad			0
@entity85 mp @entity113 said : ‘ i applaud the government for getting to grips with @entity126			0
but we must n’t allow people to escape having to be reassessed by moving abroad			0
’ * in an earlier version of this article we said the @entity25 would not re-test those over 60			0
in fact , the reviews will not affect those people due to reach @entity161 age before 6 april 2014 .			0

4,000 can continue to claim until retirement
@entity67 law forces @entity1 taxpayers to continue to fund handouts
