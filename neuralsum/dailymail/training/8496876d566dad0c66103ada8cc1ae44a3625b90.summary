@entity1 gov. @entity0 , while not mentioning the commander in chief by name , took a shot at president @entity5 on thursday during a @entity6 gathering for conservatives over the @entity10 leader 's staunch refusal to characterize extremists in the @entity12 as ' radical @entity14 ' terrorists			1
taking his turn on the stage at the @entity17 , a testing ground for @entity20 presidential hopefuls , @entity0 told the confab 's attendees , the country needs a leader ' who stands up and realizes that radical @entity14 terrorism is a threat to our way of life and to all freedom - loving people around the world			1
' ' we need a president , a leader , who will stand up and say , " we will take the fight to them , and not wait for them to take the fight to us , " ' @entity0 added			2
and according to @entity0 , he may very well be that leader , having had to take on nearly 100,000 angry union members in his first term			2
his administration 's reforms , backed by the state legislature , to their health and pension systems incited a recall election , which he handily won			0
during a question and answer portion of his session on thursday , @entity0 , when asked how he would handle the conflict with @entity66 if he were in charge of the military , invoked his 2012 victory over state and national unions			2
the likely 2016 presidential candidate , currently surging in the polls with @entity20 voters in early primary states , said that like most parents , he wants a commander in chief , ' who will do everything in their power to make sure the that threat from radical @entity14 terrorists do not wash up on @entity84 soil			1
' repeating his earlier statements , the father of two teenage sons said the country needs a military commander with the ' kind of confidence ' to fight terrorists where they are			0
he then said : ' if i can do that with 100,000 protesters , i can do the same across the world , ' seemingly comparing critics of his policies in @entity1 - some of whom showed up at @entity17 and tried to shout him down - to violent extremists pillaging the @entity12			1
the @entity103 immediately pounced on the remarks , contending in an email to reporters they prove the 47 - year - old @entity20 is n't ready for prime time			0
' if @entity0 thinks that it 's appropriate to compare working people speaking up for their rights to brutal terrorists , then he is even less qualified to be president than i thought , ' @entity103 communications director @entity108 said			1
' maybe he should go back to punting , ' @entity108 added , referring to @entity0 's evasions in the past of questions he did n't want to answer			2
on one of those occasions when @entity0 was pressed to give his beliefs on evolution he asked his interviewer if he could ' punt ' and refused to put his views on record			0
a spokesperson for @entity0 's political action committee , @entity125 , later told @entity126 that the governor ' was in no way comparing any @entity84 citizen to @entity66			1
' ' governor @entity0 believes our fight against @entity66 is one of the most important issues our country faces , ' the spokeswoman , @entity130 , said in an email			1
' what the governor was saying was when faced with adversity he chooses strength and leadership			0
those are the qualities we need to fix the leadership void this @entity145 has created			0
' @entity0 was among friends and spent the bulk of his speech ticking off support for issues that are important to his base , including right to work and voter id laws			0
he also slapped president @entity5 down , though not by name , for refusing to call @entity66 extremists ' radical @entity14 terrorists ' at thursday 's conference , surrounded conservative voters from across the country who share his values , @entity0 was among friends and spent the bulk of his speech ticking off support for issues that are important to his base , including right to work and voter id laws			1
@entity0 at one point said @entity84 need a president ' who will stand with @entity166 ' - another blow intended for the current occupant of the @entity169			1
like @entity0 , @entity166 prime minister @entity170 is also visiting the @entity84 ' @entity171 this weekend for a conference			2
he will make remarks at the @entity175 's annual gathering and address a joint session of @entity177 while he is stateside			0
@entity5 wo n't meet with @entity170 while he is in @entity6 , however , because he is competing to reelection later this month , and the @entity145 worries that @entity5 would appear to be inappropriately influencing the contest if he were to open his arms and invite him to the @entity145			0
@entity0 on thursday slammed @entity5 for the move , saying the country needs a leader who will show the the head of state of a longtime ally like @entity166 with ' respect ' when he requests to visit			0
technically , it was house speaker @entity188 who invited @entity170 to @entity6			0
@entity188 independently sent an invitation to the world leader , without the @entity145 's knowledge , drawing ire from @entity10 , dozens of whom plan to boycott his tuesday address , during which he will make the case for additional sanctions on regional foe , @entity197 .			1

@entity84 needs a leader who ' realizes that radical @entity14 terrorism is a threat to our way of life and to all freedom - loving people , ' he said
' if i can do that with 100,000 protesters , i can do the same across the world , ' @entity0 later said , seeming comparing his critics to violent extremists pillaging the @entity12
if @entity0 ' thinks that it 's appropriate to compare working people speaking up for their rights to brutal terrorists , then he is even less qualified to be president than i thought , ' a @entity10 spokesman said in response
a spokesperson for @entity0 told @entity126 that the governor ' was in no way comparing any @entity84 citizen to @entity66 '
