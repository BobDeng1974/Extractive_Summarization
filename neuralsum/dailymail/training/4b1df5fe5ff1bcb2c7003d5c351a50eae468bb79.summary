close your eyes for a moment and you will recall @entity5 ’s maiden season at @entity6 and the 26 goals that took sir @entity8 hurtling towards his 13th league title			1
then there was the @entity11 in @entity12 , when his flying header in the 5 - 1 defeat of @entity16 was immortalised by some street artists inside a favela			0
it was dreamy stuff , alright			0
since then there have been times when you want to shake @entity5 like a rag doll and ask him straight out whether he will ever be the same again			2
please @entity5 , say yes			2
there is a sense they will stay there now			0
certainly there were flashes here , against @entity26 , that @entity29 wants to add to the single @entity42 trophy he has to show for brilliant career in front of goal			1
in our heart of hearts we know that @entity29 , who scored in each half of this 2 - 1 victory , is every bit as good as @entity60 striker @entity59 or @entity61 forward @entity62			1
perhaps we have grown accustomed to @entity29 over the years , scoring goals for @entity64 , @entity6 and @entity65 , and have simply grown accustomed to his name appearing on @entity68 ’s ticker			1
these days we seem to talk ceaselessly of @entity59 and @entity62 , arguing blindly on twitter , on bar stools or with colleagues about who is the better striker			0
he has been forgotten in all this , assumed to have taken his eye off the ball after @entity65 blew it all in the @entity11 semi-final against @entity78 in @entity79			0
@entity29 now has six in the @entity42 : one each in games against @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity61 , @entity84 and the two here against @entity26			1
@entity29 joined @entity6 for £ 24million in 2012 after leaving @entity64 @entity59 and @entity62 have been in outstanding form for @entity60 and @entity61 respectively both were tidy finishes , beating @entity89 in the first half with a weighted shot to put @entity6 in front and then reading @entity94 ’s flighted free - kick to win it			1
when he scored the opener , he nodded his head and ran towards the outstretched arms of his captain			2
he still has it ; maybe you never lose it			0
the goals were good , but there was also much to admire about his improvisation when his spin made @entity26 ’s central midfielder @entity107 look a mug in the second half			2
this was the real @entity29 , the man who took responsibility for launching @entity6 ’s title charge when he made sure @entity64 sold him in july 2012 for £ 24million			1
the little boy inside him called it right			0
it is easy to look back at last season , when injury affected his game and many regard it as a failure			0
he still scored 12 times in 21 @entity42 appearances and infamously claimed ‘ to be learning something new every day under @entity124 ’ in a ridiculous interview with @entity6 ’s matchday programme			1
it is fair to say that he was never at his best			0
@entity29 and @entity94 have managed to keep @entity129 out of @entity131 's starting line - up @entity132 gives fellow countryman @entity29 a celebratory hug after the striker inspired his side to victory here at @entity26 he had just two shots on target and scored from both of them , which goes a long way to explaining why he is such a revered finisher			1
@entity6 did not play well and yet @entity29 ’s two finishes made the difference on a night when @entity26 lost their third successive fixture ( @entity60 and @entity64 were the other two )			1
working alongside @entity94 , who has taken complete responsibility for the words of encouragement during the game to his strike partner , they suddenly appear to be a formidable partnership			0
undoubtedly they work better together when they @entity131 dispenses with the nonsense of who is ‘ nine ’ and who is ‘ 10 ’			0
they were made to play together and their relationship benefited as a result			0
his first goal was a deft finish and so was his second , arriving at the back stick to meet @entity94 ’s accurate 71st minute free - kick			1
it was there that he ran straight toward the thousands of travelling @entity6 supporters chanting ‘ @entity131 ’s red and white army ’ throughout the second half			2
make no mistake , @entity29 is one of them again .			2

@entity6 ace @entity5 scored two goals against @entity26
@entity29 struck @entity6 's winning goal in the 71st minute at @entity38 's
the @entity33 has scored six goals in the @entity42 this season
