by @entity1 reporter published : 11:56 est , 16 november 2013 updated : 12:13 est , 16 november 2013 the real name of a 4 - year - old girl who was murdered more than 20 years ago but not identified until this year finally has been etched into her tombstone after the girl was known simply as ' @entity6 ' for the last two decades			1
the body of little @entity8 has been buried in @entity9 in the @entity10 since it was found in a cooler on the side of a highway in @entity15 's @entity14 in 1991			1
detectives working the case of the then - unidentified body gave the girl the name ' @entity20 ' as they vowed to catch her killer			2
at a ceremony at the grave site on friday , @entity8 's mother and other family members left flowers and lit candles for the girl , who would now be 26 years old			2
identified : a grave that has been marked ' @entity20 ' for the last 22 years now honors the girl who is buried there blessing : dozens of people - including police who investigated the case for years - showed up to bless the newly engraved tombstone ' i 'm just glad that her name is on her stone , ' the girl 's sister , @entity39 , told @entity44			1
father @entity45 , who presided over the ceremony , blessed the grave site , telling mourners , ' bless the engraving of @entity8 's name and bless any child who at this moment may be suffering at the hands of evil hearts			2
' when @entity8 's body was found 22 years ago , detectives determined the girl had been sexually assaulted and suffocated before being put in a cooler and dumped on the side of a highway			1
' we could n't imagine how anybody could be so cruel to such an innocent little child , ' retired detective @entity60 said			0
for years , @entity64 and retired deputy chief @entity65 work feverishly to find ' @entity6 's ' killer , but the case eventually went cold			0
but authorities never forgot about ' @entity20			0
' in july , the @entity69 relaunched its investigation into the girl 's murder on the 22nd anniversary of they day her body was found			1
cold : after investigating the case for years , leads in the ' @entity79 ' case dried up never forgotten : police reopened the ' @entity6 ' case this year , which led to the discovery of the girl 's identity - and her alleged killer authorities canvassed the @entity14 neighborhood with flyers with a sketch of ' @entity90 ' in the hopes that it would turn up new leads			1
the day after authorities reopened the case , a call came into @entity98 - the @entity69 's tip line - from a person who claimed to have information about the case			1
the caller ' gave specific family members , where to look -- ethnicity , origin , approximate dates of birth , and she turned out to be right , ' detective @entity103 said			0
that tip led to the arrest of 52 - year - old @entity113 , a cousin on @entity8 's father 's side			1
@entity113 confessed to the murder , but later recanted , saying the confession had been coerced			0
after admitting to the murder , @entity113 gave a jailhouse interview to the @entity120 claiming that he did n't actually kill the girl , but he did help dispose of the body			2
@entity113 told the paper that @entity8 and her sister , @entity125 , were the children of his uncle and they had been living with him and his sister in their @entity131 , @entity130 , apartment			2
one day , the girls ' father never came home , and @entity113 said he and his sister - who has since died - were then tasked with caring for the girls			0
monster : authorities say @entity8 's cousin @entity113 sexually assaulted her before suffocating her and leaving her body on the side of a highway ' like garbage ' : @entity8 's body was found dumped on the side of a highway inside a cooler ' i told my sister : ‘ ' you should get some kind of receipt , ’ ” @entity146 said			1
' even if it ’s not notarized or formally prepared by a lawyer , get the real mother to sign something			0
you are going to be the one raising those girls			0
’ @entity113 claims his sister called him one day on his cell phone and told him that @entity8 had fallen down the stairs and that she needed help getting rid of the body			2
as the @entity120 notes , fewer than three - percent of @entity161 had cell phones in 1992 - when the alleged murder was committed - and the probability of a poor , immigrant kitchen worker being amongst those with a cell phone is beyond slim , so his account does n't seem to add up			0
in his confession , however , authorities say @entity113 admitted to things that only the killer would know			0
despite his recanting the confession , prosecutors contend that @entity113 sexually assaulted the girl in his apartment and then smother her with a pillow when she would n't stop crying			1
he then stuffed her lifeless body into a cooler , took a cab to @entity14 and dumped the body on the side of the highway			0
@entity113 has since been charged with murder in the girl 's death			1
his next court appearance is scheduled for november 21 .			0

@entity8 's identity was unknown until authorities reopened the case earlier this year and received a tip about the girl 's murder
