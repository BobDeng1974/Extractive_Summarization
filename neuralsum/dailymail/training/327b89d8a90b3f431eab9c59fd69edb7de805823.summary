by @entity0 published : 10:47 est , 22 october 2012 updated : 07:16 est , 23 october 2012 at 6pm tonight , @entity2 boss @entity1 is set to take to the stage in a @entity5 theatre to introduce @entity2 's latest blockbuster product - a mini tablet set to fend off competition from @entity10 ’s @entity9 and a raft of relatively cheap smaller tablet computers			1
the shrunken @entity13 is rumoured to have a screen that is 7.8inches across the diagonal – which compares to 9.7 on the original version			1
tech watchers suggest the device – like the latest incarnation of the @entity20 – will work on the superfast @entity22 mobile network that will launch next week in the @entity23			2
is this the finished @entity24 ? a leaked photo shows the purported mini on top of a full sized @entity13 for comparison the mini is thought to be 7.85in diagonally , compared to the 9.7in of the full - size ipad			1
this would allow it to be used easily on public transport , and fit into a ( large ) jacket pocket			0
@entity35 is predicting the mini - which some are dubbing the @entity13 nano - will use a 1,024 x 768 pixel panel , not a retina dispaly as seen in the latest @entity20 and larger screen @entity13 interest in the new gadget has been huge - with monitoring firm @entity43 saying 1 in every 6000 @entity23 internet searches last week were for the ipad mini			1
@entity47 technology analyst @entity46 said in a note to investors that he expects the ipad mini to launch on 2 november			1
the firm believes @entity2 could sell 5 million @entity13 minis in the december quarter , but that will be at the expense of 1 million 9.7in @entity56			1
' for every 5 million smaller @entity56 , you lose 1 million standard @entity56 , ' @entity46 wrote			0
@entity2 is said to be planning to charge £ 200 for the smaller version , which is around half the price of the cheapest @entity13			1
however , it will remain considerably more expensive than @entity10 ’s @entity9 , which costs £ 129 , and the higher specification @entity60 , which is £ 159			0
@entity10 has suggested it is selling its tablets at a loss in order to get it into the hands of families			0
the idea is that it can then cash in through sales of a vast library of books , music , films and tv programmes			0
@entity2 ’s innovative phones , tablets and computers have always come with a hefty price premium , while its rise to become the world ’s most valuable company has been fuelled by sales through its vast @entity81			0
@entity82 , the editor of @entity23 , said : ‘ if the leaks are correct , we can expect @entity2 to announce an ipad mini that ’s more like a shrunk - down ipad 2 than an @entity13			1
‘ it should have a 7.8 - inch screen with a resolution of 1024 x 768			0
it will have the new , smaller @entity90 port seen on the @entity20 , which means you ’ll need to buy a converter to plug it into any equipment that uses the old - style , large @entity2 plug			2
‘ i am expecting it to come in around the £ 200 mark , which would enable @entity2 to compete with the avalanche of cheap tablets appearing in the shops from @entity101 , @entity10 and others			0
‘ with @entity10 selling a 7 - inch tablet for just £ 129 , though , @entity2 is going to going to have a real fight on its hands as it attempt to dominate the tablet market in @entity107 in the way it has until now			2
’ it is thought that @entity2 will also launch a tweaked version of the @entity13 3 that works on the @entity23 ’s @entity110			1
the historic @entity111 where @entity2 is set to introduce its long - rumored @entity24 today @entity2 's yet - to - be - announced @entity24 has apparently been revealed in full for the first time in the best set of pictures yet leaked on the internet			1
@entity116 , a researcher for fansite 9to5mac.com , published the images on his @entity120 feed last week , sparking a wave of excitement among @entity2 enthusiasts			2
the images ( above and below ) show a device that is significantly smaller than the regular @entity13			0
according to rumours it boasts a 7.85in liquid crystal display , making it a rival to @entity101 's @entity131 and @entity10 's @entity9			0
the images also show the @entity24 utilises the controversial new connector introduced with the @entity20 , which has made all accessories available to previous @entity2 gadgets obsolete at a stroke			1
it emerged yesterday that @entity2 had instructed suppliers in @entity138 to manufacture 10million of the new smaller tablet computers , showing faith in their product in the face of stiff competition			2
insiders say the @entity24 will be announced on october 17 , a few days from the releases of @entity10 's @entity9 and @entity148 's surface tablets , and go on sale november 2			1
as yet , however , @entity2 has not officially confirmed any of the reports , rumours of leaks about a smaller @entity13			1
@entity2 's 9 - inch device dominates the market , but smaller , cheaper tablets have been eating away at the @entity13 's popularity			1
changes : this picture , leaked by the same source , compares the new connector on the @entity24 with the old version as seen on previous versions of the @entity13 the launch comes in a week of hi - tech product releases			1
@entity10 has already enjoyed huge success in the @entity166 with its updated @entity168 tablets - but will release them internationally for the first time on the 25th october			0
the gadgets , are available in both 7 - inch and 8.9 - inch versions ( although only the 7 - inch version is currently set to go o sale outside of the @entity166 )			2
@entity148 is also launching its surface tablets on the 26th , when @entity101 is also believed to be revealing new tablets and software			0
the @entity24 launch comes as research suggests a quarter of us - 22 per cent - own a tablet , with another three per cent regularly borrowing someone else 's tablet for web browsing			2
about 68 per cent of the 9,5123 adults surveyed said they purchased their tablet within the last year			0
the @entity166 survey by the @entity188 also suggests the flood of cheaper tablets , such as the @entity191 or @entity9 , are weakening @entity2 's grip on the market			2
a year ago , @entity2 had more than 80 per cent of the market , but this has now dropped to less around 52 per cent			0
the @entity9 has 21 per cent of the market , meanwhile @entity197 's @entity196 tablet has eight per cent			0
out of those surveyed , 44 per cent of adults who said they have a smartphone , 46 per cent have an @entity201 phone , 38 per cent , have an @entity20 and 10 per cent have a @entity202			0
@entity203 famously ruled on a smaller @entity13 , saying ' the current crop of 7 - inch tablets are going to be @entity206 , dead on arrival			2
' we do n't think you can make a great tablet with a 7 - inch screen			0
' however , devices like the @entity213 and @entity101 's @entity131 have shown that there is a market for smaller devices that consumers can use on public transport , causing @entity2 to reportedly change its mind on an ' ipad mini ' with a 7 or 8 inch screen .			1

gadget believed to have a 7.85inch screen - compared to the 9.7in on the most up - to - date version of the full - size @entity13
1 in every 6000 @entity23 internet searches were for the ipad mini last week
controversial new ' *lightning* ' connector also expected to be used
estimates claim @entity2 has already ordered 10 million @entity13 minis from suppliers
@entity24 , @entity236 and @entity9 all set to go on sale this month
