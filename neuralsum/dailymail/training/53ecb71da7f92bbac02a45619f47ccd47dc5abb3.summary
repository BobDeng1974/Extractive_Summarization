by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 17:36 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 17:37 est , 5 october 2012 doctors have enjoyed pay rises of up to three times the rate of inflation despite the public sector pay freeze , it was revealed yesterday			1
@entity8 , the body which negotiates salaries with the unions , said the earnings of individual doctors had gone up by between three and eight per cent a year since 2010			1
they said if doctors ’ pay was increased next year , it may put patient care at risk because savings would have to come from the front line			1
doctors have enjoyed pay rises of up to three times the rate of inflation , despite the public sector pay freeze doctors ’ pay rises over the past two years – which compare with an inflation rate of 2.5 per cent – come mainly as a result of stipulations built into their contracts			1
even though there is meant to be a pay freeze , what this means in practice is that staff are not allowed to move to a higher pay band			1
but they still get specified ‘ incremental ’ increases within their pay band , simply for continuing to do the same job			1
it means that a typical new consultant appointed in 2010 on £ 81,954 would now be earning £ 89,652 – an increase of 9 per cent			2
the figures do not include the salaries of @entity48 , who are effectively self - employed			0
@entity51 employers used the revelation to argue that the pay for doctors should be ‘ frozen ’ for the third year in a row			2
the body told the doctors ’ and @entity58 ’ @entity59 the move was ‘ essential to protect services and minimise job losses ’			0
@entity51 employers said it did not believe increases in national pay rates from april next year were necessary or affordable			2
last week , financial experts warned that monetary pressures on the health service , which has been told to make £ 20billion in efficiency savings by 2015 , will start to bite next april as the two - year public sector pay freeze comes to an end			1
the @entity73 report said an average staff pay increase of 1 per cent would add £ 400 - £ 500million to @entity51 expenditure			0
the @entity8 submission to the review body said the remuneration package for doctors remained ‘ highly competitive ’ when pension and non-pay benefits were taken into account			2
' if we do increase pay ... it will mean less investment for patient services and a greater risk of @entity51 job losses ' @entity90 , director , @entity8 @entity90 , director of @entity8 , said : ‘ everyone , including doctors , knows these are challenging times for us all			1
the simple truth is that @entity51 organisations can not afford an unnecessary increase in doctors ’ pay rates over the next year without it impacting on patient care			2
‘ we understand the frustration felt by many doctors about freezing pay scales , but we know they recognise the financial challenges facing all organisations			0
most doctors in the @entity51 already benefit from annual incremental pay increases and pay progression through training			1
any additional increase is unaffordable for the @entity51			0
' frustration ' : the doctors ' union said there is already a ' major problem with morale ' ‘ sixty - five pence of every @entity51 pound is spent on staff and they do a tremendous job			0
we must , however , make sure we get the best possible value for the money we have available to us			0
’ he added : ‘ if we do increase pay , we risk serious consequences for the sustainability of some @entity51 services and their responsiveness to local needs			0
‘ it will mean less investment for patient services and a greater risk of @entity51 job losses			0
’ the @entity136 , the trade union for doctors , rejected mr @entity90 ’s comments			0
chairman dr @entity139 said : ‘ the argument that continuing the freeze on doctors ’ pay will help @entity51 employers maintain quality of care simply does not stand up to scrutiny			2
‘ there is already a major problem with morale , with doctors at the front line dealing with huge efficiency savings and wholesale @entity51 reorganisation			1
‘ maintaining and improving care in the face of probably the biggest ever financial challenge for the @entity51 requires a more strategic response than just continuing to cut the terms and conditions of its staff			0

increasing doctors ' pay next year would be at the expense of front line services , @entity8 claims
the earnings of individual doctors have gone up by between 3 and 8 per cent a year since 2010
doctors still get specified ' incremental ' increases within their pay band despite *supposed* pay freeze
