by @entity0 for @entity1 distressing photos show a toddler boy strapped to his nap cot at a @entity6 daycare that is currently under investigation for child abuse			1
the saddening photos were taken at @entity10 by teacher @entity11 , who witnessed facility owner @entity12 carrying out the abusive act on a 2 - year - old boy			1
@entity11 then sent the pictures to the boy 's parents , @entity18 and @entity19 , saying their son was one of two boys and a little girl restrained during nap time			1
the @entity24 reports that when @entity11 confronted @entity12 about the act , she said : ' do not say anything about this			2
i know this [ is ] illegal but felt it was necessary			0
' i feel like this should never happen to any child , ' mrs @entity44 told @entity49 @entity48			0
' i was angry , i was shocked , i felt an extreme amount of guilt about how i could have chosen a place that would do this to my child			0
' shocked : @entity44 pulled her son , one of the toddlers pictured , out of the school immediately after seeing the evidence after informing @entity59 about the duct - tape incident , @entity11 elaborated on other abusive actions she witnessed at the child care center			1
she said one other child had been left alone in a room , and that kids were denied water throughout the day to reduce diaper changes			0
the @entity68 immediately pulled their son out of the school after seeing the pictures , and started informing other parents of the alleged abuse			2
when they confronted @entity12 about the incident , she initially ' appeared to shrug off the accusation as implausible , ' according to the lawsuit			0
' it was only after the @entity68 advised her that they had copies of photographs of their son duct taped to the nap mat that ms @entity12 became visibly shaken ; not distraught with what she had done but rather distressed that she had been caught , ' the suit states			1
@entity88 's son was one of the other children strapped to a bed , and she was contacted by @entity12 before hearing from other parents			2
according to the lawsuit , @entity12 called @entity88 and told her that @entity11 was spreading false accusations about her because she was ' pregnant and hormonal '			2
she admitted to using duct tape on the boys but said the @entity98 were blowing the whole incident out of proportion			1
open : the day care remains open , pending the investigation , but with far fewer students			1
the day care previously issued a statement saying they are cooperating with investigators she told @entity88 ' that she did something " incredibly stupid and one of the dumbest things she had ever done " and decided to duct tape her son and the other little boy to their nap mats			1
' @entity12 apologized to ms @entity88 and advised her that other parents " were freaking out " and that the @entity119 of the other little boy had sent out a " big email , " ' the lawsuit reads			2
@entity12 then held a school meeting on june 19 where she described the incident , saying she had tried several times to get the boy down for a nap and then made a ' very foolish decision ' to place a strip of duct tape across his blanket			1
he was not in any anguish			0
â€¦ he was not harmed in any way , emotionally , physically , at all , ' @entity12 allegedly told the parents , according to the lawsuit			0
victims : @entity138 's son was also strapped to a nap mat. she says she is also looking into her legal options she called it ' stupid ' and ' inappropriate ' and claimed the duct tape was only touching the blanket and not actually holding the child down			1
in the images , that 's clearly not the case			0
she also said she self - reported herself to the center 's director and @entity59 but attorneys say that reporting only happened after she found out about the photos			0
