a crocodile - like amphibian that was the size of a small car dominated prehistoric lakes more than 200 million years ago , a new study has found			1
palaeontologists discovered the fossilised remains of the ' super salamander ' while excavating on the site of an ancient lake in southern @entity10			1
the predator , which grew to be around two metres ( 6.5 ft ) in length and lived in lakes and rivers during the @entity16 , has been named @entity17			1
the researchers behind the discovery , which was made in mudstone flats close to @entity31 , in the @entity32 of southern @entity10 , say that the new species was similar to other primitive amphibian that were widespread at the time			1
the rare giant salamander is thought to be one of the world 's oldest species			2
it first appeared on the planet around 170 million years ago but there are now just a handful of surviving populations left in the wild			0
the @entity47 giant salamander are now the largest living amphibians and can grow to be up to 1.8 metres ( 5.9 feet ) in length			2
a @entity50 holds the giant @entity47 salamander found in @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity47 however , pollution of the rivers and streams where they live has put the species under threat			2
a park ranger in southern @entity47 recently caught a giant salamander weighing 5.5kg and measufing 83cm in length in @entity52 in southern @entity47 's @entity53 , the first of its kind to be found in the area			0
after keeping it in a temporary tank , officials released the creature back into the river , watched by a crowd of fascinated tourists			0
they say they were probably the forerunners of modern amphibians such as frogs , newts and salamanders			0
dr @entity79 , a vertebrate palaeontologist at the @entity81 who led the study , said : ' this new amphibian looks like something out of a bad monster movie			0
' it was as long as a small car and had hundreds of sharp teeth in its big flat head , which kind of looks like a toilet seat when the jaws snap shut			1
' it was the type of fierce predator that the very first dinosaurs had to put up with if they strayed too close to the water , long before the glory days of @entity100 and @entity101			2
' scientists said the giant creature ( illustrated ) would have terrorised lakes during the rise of the dinosaurs the researchers , whose work is published in the @entity109 , discovered the remains of @entity111 on the bed of an ancient lake			1
it was found within a large bed of bones where several hundred of the creatures may have died when the lake dried up			1
the image above shows the fossilised skulls of @entity17 excavated in @entity10 's @entity32 so far the researchers have excavated just four square meters of the lake and say they could find hundreds of creatures preserved in the mudstone			1
most species of giant salamander - like amphibians were wiped out during a mass extinction 201 million years ago which marked the end of the @entity132 period			2
this was when the supercontinent of @entity135 began to break apart and paved the way for the dominance of the dinosaurs			0
other species of @entity140 have been found in parts of @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
dr @entity146 , another researcher involved in the study and a palaeontologist at the @entity149 , said : ' most modern amphibians are pretty tiny and harmless			0
' back in the @entity132 these giant predators would have made lakes and rivers pretty scary places to be			0

@entity17 grew up to 2 metres long and preyed upon fish
with a mouth of needle - like teeth it could have also eaten small dinosaurs
scientists describe the new species as having a mouth like a ' toilet seat '
its fossiled remains were discovered on the dried bed of a prehistoric lake
researchers say there could be hundreds of others at the site in @entity10
the creature was related to other primitive salamanders living at the time
