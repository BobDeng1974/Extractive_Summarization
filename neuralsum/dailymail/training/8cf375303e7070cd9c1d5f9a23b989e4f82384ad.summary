@entity0 triumphantly returned home to his gym in @entity3 and , after being confronted by a huge mural of himself , laughed off suggestions he is not a big enough name to face @entity7			1
the welterweight - fresh from his victory over @entity10 - arrived in @entity11 on wednesday and addressed the media on thursday at his @entity13 in @entity3			1
@entity0 posed for pictures in front of a giant mural of himself in his refurbished gym and with the 24 - carat shorts he wore during his emphatic win over @entity10 last saturday			1
@entity0 has announced that he will donate the £ 30,000 shorts he wore during his last week to charity @entity0 posted two pictures of his refurbished gym and clothes from his fight with @entity10 on thursday @entity0 was all smiles as he talked to the assembled press at his gym in @entity3 @entity0 is hoping his next fight will be against @entity7 next year @entity0 put on his own gold - standard display against @entity10 and won much praise on both sides of the @entity32			1
he has been vocal in his desire to face @entity7 in his next fight , but the pound - for - pound king poured cold water on the idea and has called out @entity37			1
' the other night i think he did 4,000 ( attendance ) , so , @entity0 , his name holds no weight , ' @entity7 told reporters during the @entity44 convention			1
' no one knows who @entity0 is , except for people who are involved in boxing			2
' but @entity0 has hit back saying , ' i want the fight , but is @entity7 going to take the fight ? is @entity7 going to give me that chance ? that 's something we 're all waiting to hear from @entity7			1
' i 've been asking for the fight for the last two or three years			2
now he needs to come back to the press and say , " i want the fight with @entity0 "			1
i know i 'm touching distance away from that super fight			2
i think i 've proven myself many times and i think this time i 've proved myself in the biggest way so he has to take the fight			2
what else do i have to do ? ' i have a bigger name than ( @entity69 ) @entity68 did or @entity70			0
i 'm one of the biggest names in boxing			0
i know if i can bring @entity7 to @entity73 then i 'll sell out @entity74			1
how big does he need my name to be ? ' i think these are little excuses			0
i 'm sure people realise that			0
it seems to me he does n't want to fight me			0
i have the speed , dexterity , accuracy , movement , power ; i think it 's something that he does n't really want to mix with			0
' @entity0 lands a left hand during his impressive win on decision against @entity10 @entity0 arrived back in @entity92 along with his wife and daughter on wednesday @entity7 says @entity0 's ' name holds no weight ' and that he will not fight him the chance to face @entity7 has been something @entity0 has long wanted			1
he pulled out of his original fight with @entity10 last year because he believed he had a may date with the @entity101			1
however , @entity7 instead fought @entity68 , leaving @entity73 's former @entity103 silver medallist without a fight in 14 months before he took on @entity105 in may			1
@entity0 says he will not make the same mistakes and will fight in may regardless of whether @entity7 says yes or no. however , it seems unlikely that he will take on @entity109 champion @entity108 in a battle of @entity73			1
he said : ' i 'm not really interested in the @entity108 fight			0
i 'm looking at the biggest names in boxing			0
@entity7 , @entity37 , i think that 's where i belong			2
it is probable that @entity7 will insist on fighting @entity37 , an eight - division champion , in his adopted hometown of @entity118 @entity7 age 37 born @entity120 , @entity121 professional debut october 11 , 1996 fights 47 wins 47 @entity123 26 losses 0 draws 0 @entity37 age 36 born @entity125 , @entity126 professional debut january 22 , 1995 fights 64 wins 57 @entity123 38 losses 5 draws 2 @entity0 age 28 @entity129 , @entity73 professional debut july 16 , 2005 fights 33 wins 30 @entity123 19 losses 3 draws 0 ' if the fight does n't happen with @entity7 then maybe @entity37 is another option			1
i 'd like to fight in may to keep myself busy and sharp			0
i think that helps me			0
' it 's very frustrating			0
it 's just a waiting game			0
but this time i 'm not going to wait and pull out of a fight			0
if it 's not @entity7 , then i 'm going to have to look at other opponents , but if it is @entity7 then i 'm going to grab it with both hands and put on a great performance			2
' i really believe i can beat him			0
the way i fought and the way i 'm learning , i 'm getting better and stronger			0
i really believe i have his number and maybe @entity7 knows that as well			2
' meanwhile , @entity0 's shorts - at £ 30,000 the most expensive in sporting history - will be donated to charity to help raise money for the school in @entity154 where 132 schoolchildren were shot dead by the @entity156 on tuesday			1
@entity0 added : ' i 'm going to be donating them towards what happened in @entity154			2
i want to rebuild the school and strengthen the security over there			0
