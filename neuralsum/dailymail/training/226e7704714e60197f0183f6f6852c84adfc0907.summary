by @entity0 , city editor published : 17:00 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 20:32 est , 8 march 2013 @entity1 , international development secretary , wants @entity4 businesses to help build up ' responsible trade ' with developing countries foreign aid is to be diverted through @entity4 companies to prevent it falling into the hands of corrupt and wasteful regimes			1
firms will use the money to win infrastructure contracts and boost struggling economies in @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
the radical move , to be announced by international development secretary @entity1 next week , is being seen as a victory for common sense in the bitter controversy over the £ 11billion international development budget , which has been ringfenced while other departments face cuts			1
it follows years of criticism that the nation ’s ballooning aid budget is being squandered by @entity31 governments on ineffective projects , or lining the pockets of corrupt officials			1
prime minister @entity35 was said to be ‘ hugely enthusiastic ’ about the shift of emphasis from simply fighting poverty with handouts to economic development			1
in future , a significant portion of the aid budget – adding up to billions over the years – will be used to secure contracts for @entity4 firms to build roads , railways and key buildings such as schools and hospitals			1
miss @entity1 will tell the @entity51 next week : ‘ i want to see @entity4 business joining the development push with [ the @entity54 ]			1
we all have a huge opportunity to help build up responsible trade with the emerging economies of developing countries			0
‘ @entity54 will work not just across government with the @entity61 and the @entity62			0
for the first time we will be teaming up with the @entity64 , industry and others to see how we can help @entity4 businesses make a difference for developing countries			0
‘ we ’re not doing anyone a favour leaving the economic coast clear and i believe @entity4 companies can have a real role in growing developing economies through trade			1
’ @entity76 receiving foreign aid - the government is promising an overhaul of the way @entity4 's aid budget is handed out one of the problems @entity83 will face is the @entity4 's self - imposed ban on so - called ‘ tied aid ’			1
this ban means development projects using foreign aid money have to go out to an open bidding process			2
for the last 12 years , the government has followed rules that stop @entity4 firms directly benefiting from contracts funded by @entity4 aid			1
' tied aid ’ has been frowned upon by the @entity96 and the development community , which insist on international tenders			2
but this has n’t prevented @entity4 ’s competitors , such as @entity101 , from insisting only their firms can benefit from their cash			0
since replacing @entity104 , pictured , @entity1 has said she wants @entity4 's aid money to be spent more usefully the move is certain to be resisted by the aid lobby and @entity109 , which led the @entity110 designed to end poverty and hunger in poor countries by 2015			1
miss @entity1 wants investment money to be available to typical @entity4 firms – not just the multinational giants – which wish to take advantage of @entity16 ’s emergence as the fastest growing continent in the world			2
aid the government has faced huge hostility for sticking with its target of spending 0.7 per cent of national output on foreign aid , while departments at home are cut			0
but since replacing @entity104 in the post last september , miss @entity1 has made it clear that if @entity4 is to maintain its commitment to international aid , the money must be spent more usefully			1
she has cancelled future assistance to @entity135 , where there are more billionaires than in @entity4 , and earmarked part of the budget to support @entity141 peacekeeping programmes			2
and now she proposes to make @entity4 investment overseas the main priority			0
the department will continue existing spending in ‘ crisis countries ’ such as @entity147 , where the government believes that ‘ soft ’ help in the shape of aid can help @entity4 ’s broader foreign policy objectives			2
to support the new policy , miss @entity1 plans to use the expertise of the free market @entity155 to help design and implement projects			0
the government is acutely aware that while @entity160 has been paying for and building infrastructure across @entity16 , @entity4 is being left behind			2
companies such as @entity163 , one of the best road and rail contractors in the world , are being left at the starting blocks because there is no real government support for investment projects			0
@entity171 and @entity172 have told @entity4 that it is now growth , infrastructure and prosperity that need cultivating			0
and the government has formed the opinion that countries across the @entity180 no longer need general development assistance , and can work on their own or with experts in the field to address health and poverty issues			0
ideas to implement the new policy include creating some kind of @entity188 to organise and scrutinise investment programmes and joint ventures			0
it would work alongside existing institutions including the @entity4 - based @entity193 and the @entity194			0
ideally , the government would like the policy to reach @entity4 ’s smaller companies , which do not currently have expertise in @entity16 .			0

@entity4 companies will use money to win infrastructure contracts
