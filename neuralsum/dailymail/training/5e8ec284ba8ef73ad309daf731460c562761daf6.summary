these smiling pictures - forgotten for more than a century - offer an unusually relaxed insight into how a wealthy family once holidayed			1
doing away with the somewhat stilted , awkward pose usually adopted in family pictures at the time , @entity15 and @entity14 and their three children , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , are shown enjoying a family holiday like a great deal many others would have done , in the town of @entity25 , @entity26			1
yet these images are particularly poignant , because they were taken by the sports - loving family 's disabled son @entity19			2
a set of touching family photographs taken in the early 1900s and showcasing the talent of a disabled photographer have been unearthed in a small museum @entity36 took the photographs between the ages of 16 and 36 and died in @entity39 , @entity40 , in 1947 aged 57 they catalogue the holidays of the wealthy @entity14 family from @entity44			1
it is believed many were taken by @entity36 , one of the family 's sons while his family enjoyed the fashionable leisure pursuits of the era , @entity19 , who suffered with an unrecorded condition , documented their life with his camera capturing the @entity55 relaxing on the beach , posing in front of a @entity59 pillbox and taking part in fashionable leisure pursuits and games			1
amateur photographer @entity63 found the slides stashed in shoeboxes in a cupboard at @entity68 museum in @entity25			1
mr @entity63 said he believed the family gave @entity19 the camera because his disability prevented him from taking part in so many other things			1
he said : ' it was one of his few outlets			0
' there are a lot of photos of family parties and people standing on the croquet lawn and in front of the grass steps , which they seemed very proud of , ' he said			2
' they always seemed to have a sporting implement in their hands and there are lots of photos of them having afternoon tea			0
' @entity36 suffered from an unrecorded condition which resulted in him being shorter than average and meant that he needed metal calipers and a wheelchair			1
it is believed the sports mad family gave @entity19 the camera because his disability prevented him from taking part in so many other things @entity36 with his mother by a @entity59 pillbox , an armoured trench used to defend the country from attack in the @entity59 a car belonging to the family			1
amateur photographer @entity63 found the slides stashed in shoeboxes in a cupboard at @entity68 museum in @entity25 smart : the family and their friends are all impeccably dressed even as they relax on holiday fascinated by the images he discovered , mr @entity63 has been scanning and cataloguing the collection and researching the @entity14 family pictured in the photographs			1
mr @entity63 said : ' there were nearly 1,200 images in the collection sitting in old shoe boxes			0
' nothing had been done with them			0
' i looked at them and saw it was quite a treasure of photographs			0
' as i started to photograph these things , i started to become interested in the people in them and started to do a bit of family history research			2
' the family , lived a comfortable life in @entity44			1
wealthy @entity141 made his money selling horse medicine as a partner in a company which still exists today under the name @entity148			2
close : mr @entity63 said he believed the family gave @entity19 the camera because his disability prevented him from taking part in so many other things relaxed : @entity19 looks happy as he stands in this picture with a family member the pictures , taken between 1906 and 1926 , show the family and their friends enjoying the good life in @entity25 where they had a holiday home the seaside resort was an eighteenth - century invention			1
many doctors at the time prescribed ' sea air ' for the sickly and disabled as an alternative to ' taking the cure ' at a spa			0
as a result , generations of holidaymakers , from the early @entity173 age until the @entity169 , saw @entity7 's seaside resorts flourish			0
here was a place where holidaymakers and visitors could enjoy the beauty , the power and the much - touted healing properties of the sea , all from the safety of the sturdy pier			0
during the great @entity173 building boom , all seaside towns wanted a pier , and soon they had sprung up around the coastline			0
such was their popularity that by the turn of the century there were 90 piers around the country			0
the family built a holiday home they named @entity199 on the corner of @entity201 and @entity202 in @entity25 in 1903 , which has now been converted in to flats			2

the collection shows the family and their friends enjoying the good life in @entity25			2

he has also learned that although @entity223 and @entity18 both married neither of them had children			0
mr @entity63 , who has now become one of @entity68 's trustees , now plans to continue his research in to the @entity14 family			2
@entity25 's @entity228 , which is run mainly by volunteers , lacked the manpower and resources to formally catalogue the negatives and slides when they were donated in 1991			1
they were left in a cupboard for more than two decades as a result			0
a Â£ 6,000 @entity237 grant has enabled the museum to begin tackling the backlog , properly preserve the @entity14 collection and buy touch screen computers to enable visitors to view all of its photographs easily			2
