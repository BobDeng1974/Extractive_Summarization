radio 5 live presenter @entity0 led a growing mutiny against @entity4 chiefs yesterday as ‘ civil war ’ broke out over the @entity7 crisis			1
she publicly rounded on senior figures after @entity12 editor @entity11 was ‘ hung out to dry ’ by the director - general , @entity10			1
@entity4 executives at the heart of the scandal have now enlisted personal lawyers as the blame game turns increasingly vicious			1
ms @entity27 allegedly had ' impossibly high demands ' for the investigation during his grilling by mps on tuesday , mr @entity10 barely missed a chance to twist the knife over mr @entity11 ’s disastrous handling of @entity12 ’s @entity22 investigation			2
but his strategy to heap all the blame on mr @entity11 sparked a backlash at the corporation – and calls for @entity45 boss @entity27 to be quizzed about claims she was involved in the debacle too			1
both she and her deputy , @entity50 , and mr @entity11 have all employed individual personal lawyers to advise them , it is understood			1
one source said : ‘ it feels like civil war			2
the relationship between management and the news division is at an all - time low			2
' no one [ linked to the scandal ] in news wants to say anything without a lawyer present			2
there is zero trust at how management will handle all this			0
’ the @entity4 announced mr @entity11 had ' stepped aside ' on monday as it corrected inaccuracies in his october 2 blog there is also a split within news with some journalists now accusing the @entity74 team of having looked into @entity75 a year before the planned @entity12 investigation			1
the @entity4 said @entity74 strenuously denied this			1
yesterday miss @entity0 told her 32,000 followers on @entity26 : ‘ if @entity4 journos / eds make a poor editorial call , ( & most of us hve at some point ) , will they be treated by mgemnt like @entity11 has been ? ’ former radio 4 today programme editor @entity87 said mr @entity10 had ‘ dobbed @entity11 in ’			1
he told @entity12 host @entity88 : ‘ @entity89 looked as though he was hanging the editor out to dry , as members of your staff are hanging the editor out to dry , ’ and added : ‘ i find it very , very difficult to accept there was no pressure on @entity97			0
’ mr @entity11 was ordered by the director - general to ‘ step aside ’ from his role this week after he wrote an error - strewn blog on why he canned @entity12 ’s investigation into @entity75			0
he has come under fire for allegedly ‘ killing ’ the @entity22 expose by declaring the victims were ‘ not too young ’ and saying ‘ they were n’t the worst kind of sexual offences ’			0
embattled mr @entity11 has repeatedly insisted he alone took the decision to scrap the @entity12 film without anyone more senior ‘ leaning ’ on him to do so			2
yesterday it emerged his boss @entity27 , director of @entity45 , could face questioning from the same committee of mps that grilled mr @entity10			0
it was claimed she allegedly set an ‘ impossibly high barrier ’ before @entity12 ’s plans to expose @entity22 by insisting journalists act as though he was still alive and be able to sue the @entity4 for libel			1
her intervention last year is said to have influenced mr @entity11 ’s decision to scrap the report			0
@entity124 , a @entity12 reporter , speaking on @entity74 earlier this week			0
she apparently believed @entity27 put a block on the programme 's six week @entity22 probe which influenced mr @entity11 's decision miss @entity27 , 56 , has not publicly uttered a word about her role since the scandal engulfed the corporation nearly four weeks ago			1
in 2006 , she was photographed in high spirits with @entity7 at an awards lunch , and she and her husband own a holiday home in @entity136 , one of @entity7 ’s favourite haunts			0
the £ 340,000 - a - year news chief told mr @entity11 that ‘ just because @entity7 was dead , it did n’t mean there could be any skimping in journalistic standards ’ , mr @entity10 told @entity114			0
asked whether mr @entity11 might have interpreted that as pressure from above to drop the investigation , mr @entity10 said it had not been ‘ an inappropriate point to make ’			0
but a @entity12 source told @entity150 that @entity154 and @entity124 , the journalists leading the programme ’s investigation , believed miss @entity27 ’s intervention had effectively blocked their report , adding : ‘ @entity27 placed an impossibly high barrier to the story			0
’ mr @entity50 , miss @entity27 ’s deputy , is also under the spotlight after it was confirmed he had read the @entity12 editor ’s ‘ inaccurate ’ blog before publication			0
@entity4 sources confirmed the corporation would not be paying the bills for executives personal lawyers .			1
