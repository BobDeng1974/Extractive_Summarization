a millionaire fed up with being abused for driving a 2012 @entity1 has released a video revealing just what it 's like to be behind the wheel of the world 's most revered sports car			1
@entity8 , a millionaire originally from @entity9 , was inspired by a video in which a woman was filmed walking through the city as she was relentlessly cat called and approached by men			1
so mr @entity8 decided to use the cameras he had installed in his car to show both the good and the bad reactions he receives while driving a £ 260,000 ( $ 410,000 ) sports car			1
mr @entity8 recorded the video to show people 's reactions when he drives his 2012 @entity21 ( pictured ) through @entity9 this passing motorist was complementary - he called mr @entity8 's @entity1 ' beautiful ' a man pretends to wipe dust off the edge of mr @entity8 's @entity1 as he navigates a corner in @entity9 while driving through @entity9 in his blue 2012 @entity21 the video shows people pawing at his car , complementing him , or insulting him			1
for better or worse , the video makes it clear that the car turns heads			2
mr @entity8 said : ' i 've had issues before where complete strangers would throw coins at my car simply for having an expensive car			1
' i figured that having cameras would deter them and i would have protection against insurance scammers			0
' the worst encounter i had was when three young adult males were sitting on the hood of my @entity44 at a parking lot and were catcalling the girls that were walking by			0
the hood could n't support all of their weight , so it bent inwards as they were sitting on it			0
' there were several occasions when a key in the back pocket or a metal button on ( strangers ' ) pants would leave a deep scratch on the car after sitting on it			2
' i 've caught more than a dozen people sitting on my cars and i do n't know how many there are that i did n't catch sitting on the car			0
most of the time , they do it to take a picture of themselves			0
' a man stares in disbelief as he walks past mr @entity8 's @entity1			2
the model he is driving retails at £ 260,000 ( $ 410,000 ) in this interaction , a stranger gives a pointed complement about mr @entity8 's license plate this man yelled unintelligibly and pulled the finger at mr @entity8 as he drove past him two men wearing hi - visibility vests stare at the 2012 @entity1 while crossing the street mr @entity8 is aged in his 20s and became a millionaire after creating a phone app called 5 - 0 radio , a police scanner app. he said his video began as a ' parody ' of the now - infamous @entity9 cat calling footage , but claims it has a ' very real message telling people to stop damaging other people 's property '			1
' i just hope that people would stop laying their hands or butts on cars that they do not own			0
they may not understand that rubbing paint while dirt / dust is on it leaves visible scratch marks and swirls on the car			0

@entity8 made millions after he created a phone app called @entity110 - 0
he subsequently bought a 2012 @entity21 worth £ 260,000
but he claims to have been *heavily* abused while driving the *flash* car
so he decided to make a video filming the reactions he received
