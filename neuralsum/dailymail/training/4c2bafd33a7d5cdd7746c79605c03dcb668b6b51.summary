foreign secretary @entity0 said the @entity1 is now a ' putative superstate ' @entity3 is ' lighting a fire under the @entity1 ' by pledging an in - out referendum , foreign secretary @entity0 said today			1
mr @entity0 said @entity6 would not be able to extinguish public demands for a vote on @entity3 's membership of the @entity1 following the prime minister 's pledge to hold a referendum by 2017			1
the foreign secretary , who remarks are among the most @entity14 ever made by a serving cabinet minister , added that the @entity1 has become a ' putative superstate ' without @entity3 's say - so			1
mr @entity0 's claim came in a @entity19 debate today on a @entity21 bid to guarantee an @entity1 referendum in law after the next election			1
he told the @entity25 that the issue was ' surely the most important strategic question facing this country ' , adding : ' we are lighting a fire under the @entity1 by this piece of legislation			2
' we are setting off a process that politicians and governments do not have the power to stop			1
' he claimed that the threat of leaving the @entity1 would give the government ' a very powerful weapon in our armoury ' when renegotiating @entity3 's relationship with @entity6			1
it came after the @entity21 mp launching a new legislative bid for a poll said it was time for opponents of a referendum on @entity3 's membership of the @entity1 to ' put up or shut up '			1
mr @entity51 , the mp for @entity52 and @entity53 , introduced the @entity54 surrounded by @entity55 but facing only a handful of the @entity58 opposition mps			0
the @entity59 is identical to one which cleared the @entity19 last year before getting trapped in the @entity25 and failing			0
@entity62 's mp @entity61 , who voted for the @entity59 while a @entity21 mp in the last session , was one of about a dozen mps on the opposition benches while mr @entity51 introduced the second reading			0
' it 's a straightforward and simple bill because the proposition of choice and a democratic principle for our people is a simple one			0
' it is not a bill about the future of our relationship with the @entity1			2
it is not a bill about whether we should in the long term stay in the @entity1			2
it 's a bill about giving the people of this country a choice			0
' @entity62 mp @entity61 said he would support the @entity21 bid to guarantee a referendum on the @entity1 @entity100 is facing a growing rebellion from his own party over his refusal to offer an @entity1 referendum , it emerged this week			1
thirty - four @entity105 have now declared publicly that they disagree with their leader ’s stance on an in / out vote on @entity3 ’s place in @entity110			1
they include @entity58 ’s policy chief @entity111 , shadow education minister @entity112 , and two former @entity58 government ministers , @entity114 and @entity115			0
meanwhile yesterday it emerged that @entity117 , the shadow chancellor , has suggested @entity58 should back the @entity21 in proposing reform of @entity1 free movement rules			2
mr @entity117 agreed there could no longer be a ‘ free - for - all ’ in terms of the migration of workers within the @entity1			2
mr @entity0 , who said he was speaking for the @entity21 rather than the government , stressed that the instincts of the @entity3 people should be trusted			1
he told the @entity19 : ' it is right that the @entity3 people should make the decision on whether the @entity3 stays in the @entity1 or leaves altogether just as it was right that the @entity130 people made the decision about their future in the @entity3			1
' every poll shows that whatever their view on the answer to that question the overwhelming majority want the right to decide			0
' in the 41 years since the @entity3 joined the @entity140 , in the 39 years since we last had a referendum on @entity110 , the @entity1 has changed profoundly			1
' it has grown enormously in its power and its reach			0
it 's grown in its competences , its legislation has spread and the role of the @entity148 has increased almost beyond recognition at the expense of the other @entity110 institutions			0
' it has morphed from a common market into a putative superstate			1
' put plainly , @entity110 today is very different from the @entity110 people voted for in 1975 and yet the @entity3 people have never been asked whether they agreed with any of these changes			2
' so it should be no surprise to us that democratic support for the @entity1 is fragile to put it diplomatically			2
ever closer union has led to ever greater dissolution			0
' red lines : prime minister @entity163 told @entity55 yesterday that he plans to set out ' all those issues ' that will form the basis of @entity3 ’s demands ' in the months ahead ' mr @entity0 added : ' this is surely the most important strategic question facing this country today - the future of our relationship with the @entity1			1
' and it is a question on which we should trust the instincts of the @entity3 people			2
' mr @entity0 added : ' the ultimate decision of whether to or whether to stay should be for the @entity3 people			1
' the key thing is when we have completed the negotiation and we bring back the result of it , it 's not a question of whether we think the outcome is good enough			0
it 's not a question of whether @entity148 thinks the outcome is good enough			0
' it will be a question of whether the @entity3 people think the outcome is good enough			0
not only is that good for democracy it is also good for our negotiating position			0
' shadow foreign secretary @entity194 said : ' @entity58 believes any judgment about a referendum on the @entity3 's membership of the @entity1 has to be based on what is in the national interest			1
' we do not believe a @entity201 calling for an in / out referendum in 2017 on an arbitrary date , unrelated to the likely timetable of major treaty change , that puts jobs and investment at risk , is in our national interest			0
mr @entity194 also declared the recent defections of two conservative mps to @entity62 - mr @entity61 and @entity212 - the ' real reason ' for the timing of the @entity59 .			0

mr @entity0 said @entity6 will not be able to extinguish demands for a vote
