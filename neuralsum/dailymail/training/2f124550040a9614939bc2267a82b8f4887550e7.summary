by @entity0 and @entity1 streaking across the sky , this massive bolt of lightning was part of a huge electrical storm that brought chaos to rail and road users			1
@entity10 had to cancel services after the lightning struck an electrical sub-station next to the @entity15 entrance in @entity16 , @entity17 , causing a fire			1

then the lightening strikes came - great loud cracks from the sky down onto the @entity43 housing estate			1
' electric atmosphere : another @entity75 ( cloud to ground ) lightening bolt struck in the same area of the town exactly a minute after the first during last night 's storm massive storm : the third , and loudest , lightening bolt struck a house in @entity86 belonging to @entity46 , who said on @entity88 she cried from fear photographer mr @entity33 took this stunning panorama of @entity36 just before sunset last night , just before the sky turned red and an electrical storm struck now , however , with a sunshine weekend forecast , you could be forgiven for thinking that it is already summer			1

summer bluebells , which normally form carpets of blue in may , are already flowering			0
and our gardens are also full of colour from blooming tulips , peach blossom , blackthorn and the may tree – which usually only erupts into white flowers in time for @entity115			0

but despite the devastating floods up until last month , the average temperature was @entity123 ( @entity124 ) throughout winter across @entity125 – making it the fifth warmest winter since records began in 1910			0
because the soil is far warmer than usual , plants have begun their spring growth early			0

last year , the average date for bluebell flowering was may 2			2
hawthorns have began to bud three weeks early and blackthorn , another hedgerow tree , is already in blossom			0
meanwhile , many daffodils and snowdrops have already bloomed and withered			0
magnolia have been in full bloom for the last couple of weeks across much of the country , while peach blossom , which normally bursts out in early april , is now at its peak			0
@entity167 trees do not usually flower until late april , but some are already showing buds			0
the @entity138 has also had dozens of reports of tortoiseshell butterflies and hundreds of sightings of ladybirds			2
dr @entity174 , project manager of the @entity138 ’s @entity175 , said : ‘ @entity176 is well and truly on its way			0
’ @entity178 , of the @entity179 , said : ‘ @entity176 is running two or three weeks earlier than usual			0
it is due to the temperatures we have been having since january			0
' some things kept growing through the winter because it was mild and other things have started growing because the temperatures have not been as cold as they were			0
’ white : this picture shows the conditions residents in @entity190 , @entity133 , woke up to this morning - houses , gardens and cars carpeted in a thick layer of snow @entity196 contrast : the forecast comes just a day after freezing conditions were reported in @entity132			1
above , snow falls in @entity190 in @entity133 , @entity132 , yesterday morning @entity201 , of the @entity202 , said sunday could turn out to be the hottest day of the year so far , topping this year 's highest temperature of @entity204 , which was recorded in @entity205 , @entity17 , on 9 march			1

it will be cloudier in the south west , although there will be some sunshine there , too , while further north and into @entity214 there 's a high chance that it 's going to be quite overcast			1
' also in the north east and in north east @entity214 tomorrow there 's a chance of showers , and on sunday there will be a similar divide across the @entity125			1
' she said temperatures were forecast to reach up to 20c or higher on sunday , adding : ' there 's a chance we may reach the high so far of @entity204 and even just top it slightly in the south			1
