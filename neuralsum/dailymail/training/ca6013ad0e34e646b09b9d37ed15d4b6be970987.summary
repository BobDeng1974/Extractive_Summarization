sexually - charged videos and explicit lyrics are so endemic in the pop industry that parents are unable to protect their children from them , a disturbing survey has revealed			1
more than four - fifths of mothers and fathers have caught young children repeating offensive words or phrases from songs without knowing what they mean			1
the tide of sexual and violent imagery means that by the age of ten more than half understood the raunchy references anyway			1
one in thirteen parents reported that they had caught their children copying @entity20 ' ' twerking ' moves pop stars ’ images push girls into being ‘ sexual too soon ’ according to two - thirds of parents and a similar proportion say boys expect women to have ‘ unrealistic porn star bodies ’			1
a quarter said boys thought women wanted men to be ‘ into violence and gangsta culture ’			1
the extent to which the pornification of pop has been normalised in children ’s lives is demonstrated by the fact that a third of parents said their kids have acted out ‘ porn - style dance moves ’ , such as pole - dancing			1
@entity47 's outfits on prime time shows such as the x-factor have prompted complaints from parents , who believe they are not suitable for children one in 13 also reported their children copying @entity20 ’s degrading ‘ twerking ’ performance at the @entity56 in august			1
three - quarters of adults attempt to shield their children from provocative music videos , many of which are freely available on television music channels during the day			1
but their efforts are undermined by lewd spectacles on what is supposed to be family viewing			0
two - thirds said their children were exposed to unhealthy images on pre-watershed shows such as the @entity71 - proving channels and regulators are out of step with the values of ordinary members of the public			1
@entity47 prompted more than 100 complaints to @entity78 last month after appearing on @entity71 dancing provocatively in underwear			0
@entity80 responded by saying her performance was not ‘ inappropriate for the family audience ’			0
it followed appearances by @entity85 and @entity86 in skimpy clothes on the programme in 2010			0
@entity78 was criticised at the time for saying the performances were ‘ at the very margin of acceptability ’			0
attempts to bleep out offensive lyrics on the television and radio are pointless because children often ask what the words are			1
many find out anyway by talking to friends or hearing a purchased version that is uncensored			0
the extent of the problem was revealed in an online survey of more than 1,500 @entity105 members with children under the age of 16			2
almost nine in ten complained modern pop stars were ‘ far more explicit ’ than those from their own youth			0
stars such as @entity112 , @entity85 and @entity47 send negative messages to youngsters , according to more than two - thirds who young girls were learning to ‘ flash your body and be sexual to get noticed ’			1
one in ten said it enforced the belief that girls are ‘ just sexual objects ’			2
according to the study female stars such as @entity85 ( pictured ) promote a negative message to young girls only one in 50 parents agreed with pop acts ’ claims that their behaviour is ‘ empowering ’			1
more than half said they were more like porn stars and a quarter believed artists - particularly female singers - were exploited by the music business			2
parents singled out songs including @entity136 ’s ‘ @entity135 ’ , which has been banned by about 20 student unions for trivialising rape			2
other bad influences include @entity85 ’s ‘ s&m ’ and @entity142 ’s ‘ @entity141 ’			0
@entity105 founder @entity143 said : ‘ modern parents are n’t prudes - they know sex sells			2
but there ’s a strong feeling that things have gone too far now			0
‘ it ’s toxic to tell young kids casual sex and violence are something to aspire to			2
instead , if a star wants to make a statement , why not use their brain , not their body			0
’ the survey follows comments yesterday by the head of an exclusive boarding school who complained teenage girls were receiving damaging mixed messages from role models who ditch clean - cut images for raunchy personas			0
@entity169 , who runs £ 30,000 - a - year @entity170 in @entity171 , @entity172 , highlighted the transformation of @entity112 , who previously starred as a wholesome all - american teenager in @entity176 on the @entity177 .			0
