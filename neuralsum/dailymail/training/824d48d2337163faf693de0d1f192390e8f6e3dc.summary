a car enthusiast has spent five years turning a £ 100 @entity1 into an exact replica of a £ 1million supercar - using scrap parts bought on @entity4			1
@entity5 , 53 , bought an old @entity7 engine for £ 89 with the intention of transforming it into an elaborate coffee table - similar to the one on @entity12 @entity11			1
but when he realised it was too big he decided to create a replica of the 200mph @entity17 supercar			1
however , he had a problem - he had never actually seen a @entity17 in real life , so instead he bought a toy model of the @entity37 supercar before downloading photographs from the internet			1
he then spent thousands of man hours manipulating the parts in a bid to clone the thoroughbred racer			1
during the project he sliced the top off his index finger in the turbo with the digit then shooting out of the exhaust pipe			1
he also had it shipped to @entity51 - where he worked for a while - and had it registered to be driven legally			2
but the @entity7 engine died in @entity51 when customs left the engine running for hours in blistering heat to drain the petrol as he left the country			0
so he bought a second - hand @entity61 , which blew up , before buying another @entity63 which is currently in the car			2
the real @entity17 , pictured , is one of the world 's most advanced supercars able to hit more than 200mph mr @entity5 tried his best to replicate the interior of the @entity17 as well as the exterior he took his car to @entity51 where he was allowed to drive it on the roads , although it is not legal in the @entity71 with twin - turbos , @entity5 believes the car now boasts in excess of 500bhp - although he ’s yet to put his car to the test			1
the married father - of - three , from @entity77 , @entity78 , said : ' all i wanted to do was make a coffee table , but i ended up building a car			1
' it was a fun project to do with my children although my wife was n’t overly impressed			2
' in the first year the project became obsessive			2
i would do audio calls with the angle grinder in one and the phone in the other			0
' a lot of blood and sweat went into it , literally			0
on one day i lost the tip of my index finger in the turbo and it came out of the exhaust			0
' my wife likes the colour and i think she is proud of what has been achieved			0
' people who drive past and always slam their brakes on and look at it			0
if you have never seen a @entity17 before , you might not know it was n’t one at first look			2
' the body is n’t perfect but it makes people smile and my children love it			0
' spot the difference : one of these cars is worth � � 1million and the other was built in a shed with spare parts he bought most of the parts from @entity4 , including the current engine which set him back just £ 240 the various donor parts came from a range of other cars including a @entity121 and even a @entity122 the car is built on the chassis of a 1990 @entity1 and originally had a @entity7 v12 engine after using the 1990 @entity126 as a base , @entity5 scoured @entity4 for parts which include a £ 5 gearbox , wheels off a @entity121 and tyres from a @entity132			1
the fibreglass for the body cost £ 50 while the current engine was £ 240			2
the most expensive parts are the lights , which cost £ 95 each			1
however the costs have added up and mr @entity5 thinks he has spent around £ 15,000 on the car			1
he added : ' i would never do it again and in hindsight i probably would n’t have started			0
' i have gone through four engines , two gearboxes , three windscreens			0
' it has come to about £ 15,000			1
when i imported it into @entity51 i had to pay £ 5,000 in import tax but i got that back when i left			0
' the car is road legal in @entity51 and it was great fun driving around			0
' the hardest thing was probably hooking up the electric windows , air conditioning and central locking			0
i have really enjoyed it			0
' while it is not road legal in the @entity71 , the car sits on @entity5 ’s driveway next to his classic @entity163			1
he eventually hopes to take it to a drag strip or the @entity11 airfield to see how quick it is .			0

car *mad* @entity5 has spent £ 15,000 turning a @entity1 into a supercar
the 53 - year - old it specialist used parts *salvaged* from @entity4 on his project

mr @entity5 managed to chop off part of his finger building his project
