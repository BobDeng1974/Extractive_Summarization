a photographer has described the horror of being left almost completely blind in one eye by her contact lens			1
@entity4 , now 27 , developed an ulcer known as a corneal abrasion , caused by a bacterial infection which grew under her right lens			1
miss @entity4 had been wearing contact lenses since she was 15 with no problems , but woke up one day with an itchy and irritable right eye			1
@entity4 , 27 , was left partially blind in her right eye after bacteria began growing underneath her contact lens , causing an ulcer known as a corneal abrasion miss @entity4 had worn contact lenses for 12 years with no problem , but woke up one morning feeling as though her eye was ' the size of a golf ball ' miss @entity4 feared she would not be able to carry on with her photography degree due to going partially blind in one eye			1
but she learned to take photographs with her left eye and passed with first class honours she said it felt like it had swollen to the size of a golf ball , and rushed to see her gp , who prescribed drops			1
a few days later her eye was still swollen and bloodshot so she went to hospital , where tests revealed the corneal abrasion			1
doctors said the ulcer was growing on the surface of her eye , millimetres away from permanently blinding her			1
she spent a week in hospital , where medics broke the news that she was still partially blind			1
as a result , she feared she would not be able to complete the last year of her photography degree			2
determined not to give up , she taught herself how to take photographs with her left eye , and passed her degree with first class honours			1
fortunately , laser eye surgery was later able to restore her sight			2
miss @entity4 , a freelance photographer living in @entity51 , said : ' that day i 'd put my lenses in late that morning , but by 4pm my eye was aching			1
' it was itchy and usually if you rub it , it was okay			0
' but that day i had a sharp shooting pain , the worst i 'd ever experienced			0
' two hours later i took my lenses out and removed my make - up , thinking it might be irritating my eye , but there was no relief			1
corneal abrasions are a small scratch on the cornea , the clear window at the front of the eye			1
they are generally a result of injury to the surface of the eye			2
common causes include a fingernail scratching the eye , walking into something , and getting grit in the eye , particularly if the eye is then rubbed			2
it can also be caused by certain eye conditions , including trachoma , a bacterial infection			1
injuries can also be caused by contact lens being put in and removed from the eye			1
abrasions are very painful because there are many nerves that supply the cornea			0
the pain gets better as your eye heals , but this can take between 24 and 48 hours			2
if the abrasion involves the central part of your cornea , your vision could also be temporarily affected			2
apart from the pain , your eye might be watery , red and sensitive to light			2
if your eye becomes increasingly red or painful after treatment or your sight becomes much more blurred , see an eye doctor again or contact the hospital			2
source : @entity109 ' i could close my eye and thought that might take the pain away but it did n't and straining gave me a headache			1
' i was awake most of the night			0
' the next morning miss @entity4 , who is originally from @entity117 , looked in the mirror and found her eye was swollen			1
she said : ' it felt like size of a golf ball			2
' my gp said i could have conjunctivitis but i 'd had it before			0
' it made my eye itchy but this felt worse , painful			1
' she was given eye drops , which she used for a couple of days until the pain got worse and she went to @entity131 , where she was given cream to soothe her eyes			2
however , just two days later her eye was so bloodshot she went back to hospital			0
tests showed she had a corneal abrasion , an ulcer on her eye , caused by bacteria getting under her lens			1
because her eye was so sensitive she spent a week in a dark room , a nurse coming in every half an hour , 24 hours a day , to give her eyes drops			0
' the pain was under control but i was so bored , ' she recalled			0
next , doctors broke the news that she had lost sight in her right eye , due to the ulcer 's position			1
she said : ' the good news was if the ulcer had been millimetres over i would have lost my sight completely			0
' as it was slightly off centre , i would be left partially sighted in that eye			1
' but i 'd got used to that			0
my vision had been blurred since my eye first itched			0
' miss @entity4 was terrified she might not be able to complete the second and third years of her photography degree at @entity162			1
after she was discharged from hospital she had to learn to use her left eye to take pictures			1
previously she had used her right eye to do this , but she could n't now she was partially sighted in that eye			1
she was told she would not be able to have laser surgery to fix it as it required cutting a flap in the lens , which was not strong enough for the procedure and would tear			0
miss @entity4 was forced to spend a week in hospital where nurses put drops in her eye every half an hour for 24 hours			1
fortunately , years later she had laser eye surgery to restore the sight in her eye miss @entity4 struggled with her photography course as she was partially blinded in one eye			1
she says her friend @entity183 ( left ) helped he take notes and assisted her on shoots a specialist then suggested she could ' piggy back ' her lenses , to improve her sight in that eye			2
it meant wearing a hard lens directly on her eye as a softer one would sink in to the ulcer , then putting a soft lens on top of that			2
miss @entity4 said : ' i 'd have to get used to wearing two lenses so i said , " i 'll just wear glasses			2
" for the next month miss @entity4 continued to use the drops and creams she had been given , to help her eye heal			1
she said : ' my eye was uncomfortable and still watering			0
' i struggled with my uni course and had to teach myself how to use my left eye to take photos as my right one was blurry			1
' my tutor said i should take a year out but i refused and stuck it out			0
' my best friend , who was on my course , helped me take notes and assisted me with photo shoots			0
without her i would n't have got through it			0
' then my dad found a specialist who suggested a stronger hard lens to improve my sight			0
' it meant miss @entity4 could complete her degree and gain a first class honours			2
she wore the hard lenses for the next few years			0
however the sight in her right eye was still limited and the lenses started to become irritating and uncomfortable			0
then , she was referred to the private @entity227 , and told that in fact she could have laser surgery to renew and improve her sight in both eyes			0
she said : ' as i 'd been told before i would n't be able to have laser treatment , i thought they would n't be able to help			0
' but miss @entity4 had surgery on both eyes , to improve her left eye so she would n't have to wear glasses or lenses			1
miss @entity4 wore glasses as a young girl ( pictured ) but had worn contact lenses ever since she was 15 with no problems , until she developed the corneal abrasion that left her partially blind next , ultrasound was used to guide a laser to remove the scarred area of her right eye , while preserving the clear tissue underneath , restoring her sight in that eye			1
she said : ' the surgery was painless and took only a few days to heal			0
i was nervous but it was over in a minute and i did n't feel a thing			0
' having an infection was rubbish			0
' you do n't want these things to happen			0
' but if it had n't , there 's no way i would have got to the clinic , where the staff were great			0
' after i took out my lenses that day i threw them away but if i 'd kept them i could have sent them off to find out what the bacteria was and how it caused my infection			2
' i find it hard to understand how a contact lens could have damaged my eye so badly			0
' i did everything right but still almost lost my sight			0
' rising numbers of young people are suffering potentially devastating eye infections due to a lack of knowledge of the risks of contact lenses , say experts			0
