by @entity0 ‘ let me @entity1 that for you ’ is a phrase a lot of @entity6 users might soon have to get used to			2
it ’s been revealed that @entity1 ceo @entity8 is intent on getting @entity9 to switch its default engine from @entity11 to @entity1			1
currently @entity11 is the default search engine on all @entity9 mobile devices			1
@entity1 ceo @entity8 , seen here delivering her keynote address at the annual @entity15 ( @entity15 ) in @entity16 , @entity17 on 7 january 2014 , is intent on making the tech giant a big player in the search engine market by getting @entity9 to dump @entity11 as its default search engine whether you ’re using the web or talking to @entity25 , @entity11 ’s powerful algorithms are the automatic method of finding what you were after			1
of course , you can alter your device ’s settings to change this to one of the other providers like @entity1 or @entity34 ’s @entity33			2
according to sources speaking to re / code , however , @entity11 ’s competitors are not going down without a fight			0
for starters , @entity33 has taken over from @entity11 as the brains behind @entity25			0
it has been a difficult 12 months for @entity1			0
last may , @entity41 announced it was switching its 6 million subscribers from using @entity43 after reports of problems and bugs with the service			0
then , in october , a redesign was met with outrage after thousands of users complained the new @entity43 had removed popular features and was more difficult to use			0
in december , @entity1 was also among the major companies targeted by the pony botnet in which two million accounts were compromised			0
and most recently , @entity1 was announced as one of the many websites susceptible to the @entity58 bug			0
but with the impressive performance of @entity62 's @entity61 , in which @entity1 holds a large share , the company could get a cash injection that will enable it to boost its profile			2
and @entity1 has already set in motion plans to pitch @entity9 a bold idea to dump @entity11 for good			1
it has been reported that @entity1 's search functionality , which was previously powered by @entity33 , will be given a revamp as a standalone service			1
‘ this is the aim of the whole effort here , to grab the pole position in @entity78 search , ’ one person working on the plans said			0
‘ it will take more than pretty pictures , though , to convince @entity9 to give up on @entity11 , given its focus on consumer experience being top - notch			2
‘ but @entity8 wants it very badly			0
’ if successful , the bid could signal a turn in fortunes for a company that has struggled to keep itself relevant on the @entity86			0
since 2007 @entity1 has had seven different @entity87 , each of whom has attempted to reverse a downward spiral for the website			0
and last year , @entity41 ended its affiliation with @entity43 after reported problems with the service			0
but things now seem to be on the up , especially with an impressive quarterly performance for @entity62 ’s @entity61 , which @entity1 has a large stake in			0
despite a sometimes frosty relationship , @entity9 and @entity11 have worked in tandem for many years although both @entity101 and @entity102 were dropped as default apps on iphones and @entity105 last year this decision to focus their efforts to search engines , however , will be a whole new challenge for @entity1			1
the company is said to be intent on making itself a powerful player in the mobile search engine business			1
and @entity116 ’s dream to make @entity1 the default search engine for the @entity118 on @entity9 ’s @entity6 and @entity105 is a big part of that effort			1
@entity116 is said to have even prepared images and details of what the product would look like to pitch to @entity9			2
@entity9 , meanwhile , is yet to comment but it is believed a deal is not imminent			0
this is n’t the first time @entity1 and @entity11 have locked horns – it was recently reported that the former was planning to launch a competitor to @entity11 ’s @entity102			1
although @entity9 ’s relationship with @entity1 is reportedly very good , the @entity78 giant will understandably be reticent to burn any more bridges with @entity11 , considering its services are generally loved by @entity9 consumers			1
@entity9 has already dropped both @entity101 and @entity102 as default apps on their devices			2
would @entity9 be willing to burn more bridges with @entity11 ? that 's what @entity116 will be hoping when she pitches the revamped @entity1 search service to the company soon in a bid to become its primary search engine getting customers to accept @entity1 as their primary search engine might be a big ask			1
but @entity116 ’s previous experience in charge of product development within search functionality at @entity11 could prove invaluable			1
she will be all too aware of the revenue @entity11 reaps in from being the number one search engine			1
the plan is also rumoured to signal an end to @entity1 ’s search and advertising partnership with @entity34			2
@entity116 seems determined to make big waves in the search engine field with @entity1 .			1

@entity164 is reportedly planning a *secret* assault on @entity11
the @entity1 ceo has plans to get @entity9 to drop @entity11 as its search engine
default *option* on iphones and @entity105 would be @entity1 's revamped service
@entity116 is reporedly intent on making @entity1 a big player in search
could signal a change in fortunes for the @entity181 tech giant
