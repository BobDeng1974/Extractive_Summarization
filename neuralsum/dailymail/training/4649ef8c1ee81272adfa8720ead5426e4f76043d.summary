by @entity1 reporter published : 01:59 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 01:59 est , 6 march 2014 several participants in the carnival parade in the @entity5 marched wearing @entity7 outfits - and the island nation 's @entity8 has come out in defense of the outfits following an outpouring of criticism			1
the culture ministry is tasked with approving groups that are permitted to march in the annual parade , so when a group showed up wearing klan outfits - which represent hate , fear and oppression against @entity22 in the @entity24 - people expressed their outrage			1
in a series of post on @entity29 on monday , the ministry defended the group 's attire by explaining that it was for a portion of the parade dedicated to commemorating historical events			1
hate : the @entity7 represents a dark , painful episode in @entity37 history			1
@entity7 imagery is widely regarded as offensive ( file photo ) ' every group is free to choose their themes , whether using elements of the @entity5 identity or universal culture in their costumes , ' the ministry tweeted			1
another tweet noted that the @entity5 is a ' free country ' where people are at liberty ' to express their creativity			1
' the controversy was first reported by @entity53			0
in a followup statement , the ministry claimed that the costumes were intended to be critical of the @entity7 in the @entity37 , which has a history of violence against blacks , and still exists - albeit in a much smaller capacity than in the past - today			1
not everyone was convinced , and many took to social media to voice their disdain			0
' if the point was to demonstrate the obscurantism of a historical period , the message didnâ € ™ t come through ! ' write @entity29 user @entity69			0
the @entity71 blog caught wind of the story after it gained traction in the @entity5 media on monday			2
the bloggers were equally outraged			0
disgrace : the @entity7 still exists in the @entity37 today , although in much smaller , isolated , powerless sects ( file photo ) ' if the @entity7 procession was meant to be humorous or satirical , it obviously failed , ' @entity79 wrote , as initially reported by the @entity81			2
the @entity5 is no stranger to controversial racial issues			2
last year , the @entity84 issued a ruling that eliminated the birthright citizenship to be applied retroactively			0
this ultimately jeopardized the immigration statuses of thousands of @entity92 immigrants and their @entity5 - born children , the majority of which are black			0
according to the @entity81 , human rights groups estimate that the ruling could strip more than 200,000 people of their citizenship			0
the @entity5 government says those estimates are too high .			0

the ministry of culture claims the outfits were part of the parade commemorating historical events
officials said the @entity5 is a ' free country ' and groups in the parade are free to choose their themes
tweets from the ministry later said the outfits were intended to be critical of the @entity7 in the @entity37
