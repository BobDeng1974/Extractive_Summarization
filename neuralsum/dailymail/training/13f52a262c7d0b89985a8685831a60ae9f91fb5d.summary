the former head of the military , lord @entity0 , pictured , has hit out at government defence cuts the former head of the military has hit out at the government ’s defence cuts , saying they could leave @entity8 with an army more suited to a ‘ banana republic ’			1
lord @entity0 of @entity11 , who stood down last summer , said the reduced numbers of regular soldiers would be ‘ a problem ’ if the country was involved in another long - running conflict			1
in a separate swipe at defence secretary @entity18 , he said he respected him , but suggested he was not ‘ clubbable ’ , and said that he would ‘ never make a soldier ’			1
and lord @entity0 said he had disagreed with the strategy of cutting soldier numbers and relying increasingly on reservists - claiming he was not involved in the decision , which was taken out of his hands			1
around 20,000 soldiers will be cut over the next four years in the largest redundancy programme ever attempted , coinciding with the end of @entity8 ’s 13 - year campaign in @entity29			2
but the peer - formerly general sir @entity0 – warned that a failure to retain quality people in the army , navy and air force would be disastrous for the long term future of the forces			1
‘ you will always have an army or armed forces			2
every country does ’ , he said			0
‘ the difference between the @entity8 armed forces and those of most other countries , and i ’ve come across many , is the quality of our people			0
we do n’t pay them brilliantly by any means			0
only now , when i ’m outside , do i realise for the first time what people can be paid			0
‘ but because we look after them and because it ’s socially at every level acceptable to be in the @entity56			0
whether you are a private in the greenhouse from @entity60 , or the heir to the throne , or you are a captain in some smart organisation , the fact is there is a consensus that it ’s a good to be in the armed forces			0
‘ if you lose that because you do n’t look after your people well , you will have an army , a navy and an air force , but it will be the sort of army , navy and air force with which we do n’t associate with the @entity8 , that you associate with banana republics ultimately			0
’ lord @entity0 said defence secretary @entity18 , pictured , would ' never make a soldier ' lord @entity0 commanded the armed forces in @entity29 in 2006 - 7 and was made @entity78 in 2010			1
cutting the numbers of soldiers to 82,000 meant on similar sustained campaigns ‘ they yes , we would have a problem			2
our regular soldiers would have to go back more frequently than is desirable			0
’ this would be a long - term problem , but by 2020 , he said , ‘ the @entity8 forces will look very impressive , will still be the second biggest spender in @entity87 and after the @entity88 we will be the most capable			1
’ while he added that he would always wonder if people would feel he let the forces down by allowing soldiers to be made redundant , he had felt it was crucial to get the economy back on track			0
as to relying on reservists , he said this decision was taken out of his chain of command , and he had argued for smaller cuts			2
in his maiden speech to the @entity102 this week , lord @entity0 said @entity8 ’s armed forced would need more resources to deal with the global threat of jihadis , and called for defence spending to increase as the economy starts to grow or the forces ’ effectiveness ‘ will inevitably deteriorate ’ .			1
