by @entity1 reporter published : 11:22 est , 11 may 2013 updated : 11:25 est , 11 may 2013 the mother of @entity4 's children repeatedly went to authorities with accusations he was beating , abusing and threatening her			1
but her complaints never reached the point where @entity4 was imprisoned or triggered additional police investigations			2
the @entity12 's accusations against @entity4 began in 1989 and the last came in 2005 , three years after he allegedly kidnapped the first of three women and held them in a run - down house in @entity16			1
in the first case , he was not sentenced to prison and in the other two @entity12 chose to drop proceedings			2
family : @entity12 , is shown with two of her children , @entity21 , left , and @entity24			2
@entity12 , who died last year , was the wife of @entity4 , accused of kidnapping and holding three women captive for a decade in his @entity16 home			1
in custody : @entity4 was arraigned on four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape to which he pleaded not guilty the three @entity4 brothers , from left @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , all appeared in court this week on separate charges @entity4 looked down at the ground for nearly the entire proceeding , biting his collar and signing documents with his handcuffed hands			1
he did n't speak domestic abuse experts said victims in such cases often change their mind because they are afraid , or they lack knowledge of the legal system			0
@entity4 now has been charged with three counts of raping @entity4 , @entity4 and @entity4 and four counts of kidnapping the three women and his daughter born to @entity56 while in captivity			2
an @entity59 prosecutor said on thursday he intends to charge @entity60 with murder in connection with the starvation and abuse of @entity4 during pregnancies that led to miscarriages			1
@entity12 died in april 2012 , at the age of 48 , from an accidental overdose of painkiller oxycodone , according to an @entity71 coroner			1
her last complaint against @entity4 , a 2005 request to the court for an ' order of protection ' could have been a missed opportunity to expose him , domestic abuse experts said			1
if he had violated the order he could have been investigated by police and possibly arrested			0
that could have been an opportunity to find the women he allegedly held captive , or it could have made things worse if they had been abandoned without him and unable to leave the house			0
@entity4 , a former school bus driver , showed no reaction during the prosecutor 's statement , staring intently at the floor @entity12 also filed a police report in 2005 saying @entity4 had threatened to ' beat your ass ' in front of their daughter , according to the report			1
a spokeswoman for @entity16 mayor @entity99 said that police told @entity12 that year to go to the county prosecutor 's office and file a criminal complaint but she did not			1
instead , @entity12 sought a civil order of protection in county court			1
in @entity59 , a victim can get a civil order without criminal charges because they believe this will be less upsetting to the offender , said @entity112 , director of the domestic violence and stalking unit for the city of @entity116 , which is 140 miles from @entity16			0
@entity12 eventually dropped even that request for a protection order and so the court case was dismissed			1
' that breaks my heart , ' @entity120 said			0
@entity12 had four children with @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 - and her efforts to protect herself from him spanned at least 16 years			2
the first incident was in 1989			0
@entity4 pleaded no contest and was given a year of probation after @entity12 made a domestic violence complaint against him , according to a @entity135 court document			1
on december 26 , 1993 , @entity4 was arrested after he arrived home drunk and began beating @entity12 , police said			1
' i was afraid that he would come home in this condition so i had already called police , ' a police report at the time quoted @entity12 as telling them			2
she told police that he had thrown her to the ground , hit her about the face and head and kicked her , according to a @entity16 police report			0
their 12 - year - old son , @entity125 , ran out of the house to get help for @entity12 and was pursued by @entity4 , the report said			1
when a grand jury considered the incident , @entity12 said she could not remember the abuse , according to court documents			1
' she was afraid , ' said @entity162 , a former police officer and owner of @entity164 , a private investigations company , who tried to help protect @entity12 from @entity4			1
domestic violence experts say abuse victims often raise charges and then back down from pursuing them out of fear or other difficulties with the legal system			0
' if they do n't have the support and the knowledge to go through with what they need to do , a lot of victims stop , ' said @entity179 , chief executive officer of @entity16 's @entity180			2
according to @entity135 court documents , @entity12 had been granted full custody of her and @entity4 's children by 1997			1
by then , she was in a new relationship with a man named @entity186 , who was a guard at a hospital where she went for her injures from @entity4 's beatings , according to @entity186			1
on august 29 , 2005 , @entity12 went to court again , seeking an order of protection against @entity4			1
she also said he had threatened to kill her and her children during the previous year and had ' abducted ' the children			0
a year before that complaint , two of the daughters , @entity128 and @entity126 , accused her new partner , @entity186 , of sexual abuse , @entity162 said			2
he investigated the case on behalf of @entity186 , and believes that @entity4 manipulated his daughters into accusing @entity186			1
@entity12 and @entity186 denied the abuse			2
@entity186 was convicted in september 2005 on five charges of child molestation based on the testimony of the daughters , and was sentenced to three years of community supervision , according to court documents			1
@entity210 declined to be interviewed by @entity211			0
@entity212 is in prison serving a 25 - year sentence after being convicted of attempting to murder her baby daughter in 2007 by slashing her throat			0
also in september 2005 , authorities tried to serve @entity4 with a summons to attend a hearing on @entity12 's complaint			1
' they went to his house three times and no one answered , ' said @entity225 , administrative judge for the domestic relations court in @entity16			2
@entity4 came to the court to get the summons , she said			2

court records show @entity4 and @entity12 both attended the hearing as did @entity4 's lawyer			1
@entity12 's lawyer , @entity238 , did not show up , citing a conflict with another case in juvenile court , records show			1
@entity238 , a former @entity135 judge , resigned from the practice of law in 2011 as he was facing discipline , according to the @entity245			0
his law license had been suspended twice before in 1999 and 2000			0
repeated attempts by @entity211 reporters to reach @entity238 by phone or at residences listed for him were unsuccessful			0
@entity12 decided not to proceed with the request for a protection order , according to court documents			1
her lawyer advised her that she would be at a severe disadvantage if she went ahead without him , documents show			0
the case was dismissed and she did not exercise her legal right to revive it			0
' she feared this man ( @entity4 ) , ' said @entity186 , who now is unemployed and on disability			0
' this man had her psychologically under control			0
every movement she made , he was aware of			0

' beaten : @entity12 , pictured in a family photo , allegedly suffered broken noses , teeth and ribs house of horrors : in a photograph taken in 2001 , suspect @entity4 stands with a former girlfriend in front of a padlocked door , which led to the basement where he allegedly kept the girls since 2005 , victims ' advocates have been added to the justice system in @entity59 to guide women through the hearing without a lawyer , said @entity284 , senior attorney at the @entity285			1
another innovation is that in the past 15 to 20 years the justice system has become more sensitive to the pressures on battered women , said @entity289 , prosecuting attorney for @entity291 , @entity59 , and chairman - elect of the @entity294 's criminal justice section			0
authorities are now more willing to prosecute domestic violence cases even when the victim does not want to , he said			0
if @entity12 had gotten the protection order , it would have been effective for five years			2
any violation by @entity4 could have been prosecuted as a crime			0
' it 's possible that had she gotten that order , there could have been follow - up prosecution , absolutely , ' @entity284 said			0
@entity12 decided in late 2005 to move her children to @entity71 , according to @entity162 and @entity186			2
after she died last year , her son @entity60 , who now lives in @entity116 , @entity59 , posted on the funeral home online guest book : ' dear mom			0
