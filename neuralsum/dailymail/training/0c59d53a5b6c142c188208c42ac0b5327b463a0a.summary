by dr @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 15 march 2014 updated : 17:01 est , 15 march 2014 modern mums are often portrayed as being irrational for stopping their children playing with dirt			0
but the plight of @entity7 skier and flag - bearer @entity8 shows there are real reasons to be wary			0
the 15 - year - old was blinded in one eye by an infection known as toxocara , which is contracted from contaminated soil			1
@entity8 of @entity16 , 15 , pictured with guide @entity17 at the @entity19 , was blinded in one eye by toxocara what is toxocara ? @entity22 are essentially dog worms , whose eggs are passed out in the dog ’s faeces			1
accidental ingestion causes humans to be infected			0
children playing in parks are most at risk , as soil may be contaminated by passing canines			1
toddlers putting their hands in their mouth after playing in dirt or eating soil are another at - risk group			2
@entity22 is contracted from soil contaminated by dog faeces and can cause blindness how many people are affected by toxocara in the @entity45 ? studies have shown that up to three per cent of the @entity45 population have antibodies to the parasite , which means they have ingested it at some point			1
but it is usually symptom-less and causes no problems for most people			0
how does toxocara cause blindness ? once ingested , the eggs hatch in the intestine and the parasite larvae cross the gut wall into the bloodstream			1
this allows them to travel to organs including the liver , heart , brain and eyes			2
the larvae do n’t develop at these sites , but in rare cases local inflammation in reaction to them causes the disease toxocariasis			0
in the eye , it can cause blindness , as happened to @entity8			2
how can i prevent my child getting toxocara ? handwashing after being in the park , and before eating , are essential , as is washing all raw vegetables before eating .			0

@entity22 is contracted from soil contaminated by dog faeces
it is essentially *dogworms* which hatch in the intestine and *spread*
if the parasites travel to the eyes it can cause blindness
