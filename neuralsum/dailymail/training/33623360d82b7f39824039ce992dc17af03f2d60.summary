@entity8 , 32 , who has been dubbed the man with no face , suffered years of abuse over his disability and was terrified his unborn child would inherit the same condition			1
but he and wife @entity15 , 25 , from @entity16 and @entity17 in the @entity19 @entity18 have been able to enjoy every moment with newborn daughter @entity21 after she was given a clean bill of health			1
as soon as @entity8 held his new daughter he quickly checked her over for any visible marks			1
but the new parents were overjoyed to find their little girl was healthy and unmarked			1
@entity8 suffers from the skin disorder , @entity43 , which causes multiple flaps of skin to cover his entire face , imparing his vision and effectively making him almost faceless			1
he said : ‘ i was extremely worried about my baby ’s facial features			2
when i saw that she was pretty and fine , it was a great relief			2
she has a fair and beautiful face , just like an angel			1
’ happy family : the proud parents pose with members of their family near their home in @entity16 and @entity17 in the @entity19 @entity18 @entity8 explained his new daughter has brought joy into his life after years of misery because of his own facial features			1
he said : ‘ i want to forget about my past life			2
being a father is a new chapter in a man 's life and i am embracing every second of it			1
i will enjoy it and i ’ll now be a lot more worried about her than myself			2
i do n’t care so much about me anymore			2
’ when his wife @entity15 found out she was expecting , the pair suffered many sleepless nights worried whether @entity8 would pass on his condition			1
@entity15 , who was born with just one foot , married @entity8 in august 2008			1
@entity8 struggled to find a wife for many years but when he met @entity15 , they bonded over their disabilities , and finally agreed to marry			1

she and @entity8 bonded over the disabilities before deciding to marry @entity8 said : ‘ we had always wanted children but we were always too scared			1
in the end we took a chance but i prayed throughout the pregnancy that we had a healthy child			1
i did n’t care if it was a boy or girl as long as he or she did n’t have to hide its face in shame			1
‘ when i finally heard my daughter ’s cries , it was such a special moment , my heart was full of happiness			2
’ even though @entity8 can not see enough to get involved fully in his parenting duties he has been helping where he can			1
he said : ‘ i ca n't see properly , so i ca n’t do much to help my wife			2
my wife is much more organised anyway , she knows how to handle a baby			0
' fathers are not trained but i do what i can			0
i sometimes hold her while my wife is in the kitchen or doing other work			0
” @entity8 and @entity109 would like more children , but their financial problems might not allow it			1
‘ i thank god for blessing me with a beautiful daughter and we ’d love more children			0
' but i do n’t earn enough			0
no parent would want their child to suffer any health problems , but they do not want them to suffer financially either			0
’ @entity8 has taken to begging to support his family			1
his condition has meant he ca n’t see properly so is unable to secure a job			1
he travels to @entity17 's capital city , @entity127 , every year for several months to make enough money to send home			1
‘ i do n’t want to leave my daughter but i do n’t have much choice and i will have to leave in the @entity132			0
i have to earn money to support my family and this is the only way i can make any , ’ he added			0
@entity15 said @entity8 has been a wonderful husband and believes he will go on to make a great father			1
‘ we were worried for a long time about what our children would look like but now i ’m sure all our children will be healthy , ’ she added			2
‘ no matter what @entity8 looks like , i love being married to him			1
i do n’t regret one day as his wife			0
i like him just the way he is			0
his face is god ’s wish , we ca n't do much with it so we accept it and live our lives			2
' but thankfully it was not the same wish for our daughter			0
our prayers were answered and our baby is fine			0
we refuse to waste another minute worrying about it now			0
we will live our lives , happily			0
’ in its mild form the condition typically causes harmless coffee - coloured patches on the skin @entity43 is the name for a group of conditions that cause lumps to grow on the coverings of nerves			1

some people have a very mild form and may not realise they have it – developing six or more harmless coffee - coloured patches on the skin			2

they can also grow along deeper - seated nerves inside the body , which can be painful if knocked			0
