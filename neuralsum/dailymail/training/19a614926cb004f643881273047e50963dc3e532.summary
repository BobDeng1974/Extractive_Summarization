the inexorable tick of time moving forward is something that has puzzled scientists for more than a century			1
but now a new theory has been proposed that may help answer some questions - at least with regards to the beginning of time and what happened in the ' past '			1
they say that at the moment of the @entity13 a ' mirror universe ' to our own was created that moves in the opposite direction through time - and intelligent beings in each one would perceive the other to be moving backwards through time			1
since the @entity13 the universe has given rise to planets , stars and galaxies ( illustration shown ) as time ticks forward and matter clumps together			1
but a new theory suggests that at the same time a second universe is moving in the opposite direction , with a ' backwards ' arrow of time to us the radical theory was proposed by dr @entity34 of @entity35 in the @entity36 , dr @entity37 of the @entity38 in @entity39 and dr @entity40 of the @entity41 , also in @entity39			1
their research attempts to answer questions that remain about the ‘ arrow of time ’ - which is the concept that time is ‘ symmetric ’ and everything moves forwards			0
they say that at the time of the @entity13 not one but two universes formed – both moving equally in each direction through time , but opposite to each other			1
‘ time is a mystery , ’ dr @entity34 told @entity56			1
‘ basically , all the known laws of physics look exactly the same whichever way time runs , and in the world in which we live everything goes in one direction			0
in 1927 @entity36 astronomer @entity68 first devised the ‘ one - way direction ’ or ‘ asymmetry ‘ of time			1
he said that by studying the organisation of matter , it was possible to make a 4d map of the universe			0
the so - called ‘ arrow of time ’ supposedly points to a move spread out and ‘ random ’ future , toward which everything is moving			1
this is also known as entropy , which tends to increase with time			0
entropy , a consequence of the @entity84 , will increase as energy dissipates and matter and energy disperse			0
this means that entropy will always increase in the universe			2
some say this may lead to a ‘ heat death ’ future where everything is spread so thinly that nothing can exist any more – a scenario famously postulated in @entity97 ’s short story @entity96			0
however , owing to the law of gravity , some think such a future is not a possibility			0
‘ the universe is expanding , we get older , the order seems to grow - at least in our immediate vicinity			0
’ dr @entity34 gives the analogy of an ice cube melting in a glass of water as the universe moving from structure to disorder - known as entropy			1
he says at the end of the 19th century this caused concern - as people thought the universe would end in a ‘ heat death ’ where the temperature in the universe was the same everywhere , just like the ice cube			0
but when gravity is taken into account it seems the theory no longer holds true - and it may also explain a dramatic start for the universe			2
@entity130 , writing for @entity132 , said : ‘ thus , the sheer force of gravity sets the stage for the system ’s expansion and the origin of time ’s arrow			0
’ by assembling a simple model with 1,000 particles , the researchers say their theory shows that as you move backwards through time - to disorder - you eventually come out the other side after the @entity13 in order again - a ‘ mirror ’ universe			1
the new research attempts to answer questions that remain about the ‘ arrow of time ’ – which is the concept that time is ‘ symmetric ’			0
they say that at the time of the @entity13 not one but two universes formed – both moving equally in each direction through time , but opposite to each other , like two one way systems while time moves forwards for us , intelligent beings in the ' mirror universe ' would think that we are actually moving backwards			1
however , we would both have come from the same beginning - the @entity13			2
it should also be noted that the universes are not identical , but simply time - symmetric this universe would not be exactly the same as ours , though ; it would have evolved and changed in its own way , completely separate to our own			2
however , it would be subject to the same laws of physics , so it would likely have planets , stars and galaxies just like in our version of the cosmos			0
explaining the model as a swarm of bees , dr @entity34 says that as time increases , the universe moves from an initial chaotic ‘ swarm of bees ’ to a more structured and ordered cosmos			1
‘ if you look at a simple model with a swarm of bees in the middle [ the @entity13 ] but breaking up in either direction , then you would say there are two arrows of time , pointing in opposite directions from the swarm of bees , ’ he said			1
‘ one arrow would be forwards , and one backwards			0
‘ if you define time as the direction in which order is increasing , you always get two arrows in opposite direction from the central chaotic region			2
’ he continued that it is opening up a new way to think about the @entity13			2
‘ at the moment when people talk about the @entity13 , they more or less throw their hands up in despair and say they ca n’t say what happened			2
‘ now our work is beginning to suggest we can actually say more than people thought			0

scientists have proposed a radical new theory of time for the universe
@entity36 physicist dr @entity34 and others say there are two arrows of time
these move in opposite directions and both formed at the @entity13
this means at the @entity13 there were two universes that formed
*observers* in either universe would view the other as moving backwards
