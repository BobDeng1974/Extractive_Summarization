by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:02 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 19:02 est , 15 january 2014 @entity3 : ' a country of the size and global reach of @entity8 leaving would be very bad for the @entity9 ' a @entity8 exit from the @entity9 would be a disaster for its other members , chancellor @entity3 warned yesterday			1
in one of his most significant speeches to date on the nation ’s future in @entity17 , he said : ‘ a country of the size and global reach of @entity8 leaving would be very bad for the @entity9			1
’ the @entity22 leadership is seeking to regain the initiative on the issue of @entity17 following a demand from 95 backbench mps for @entity8 to demand a unilateral veto over any @entity9 edict , a move that critics say would mean the end of the single market			1
the @entity33 have promised that if they remain in power , an in / out referendum on @entity8 membership of the @entity9 will be held by 2017			1
mr @entity3 suggested he wanted to chart a course between hardcore @entity38 who want to leave the @entity9 no matter what , and pro-europeans who once urged @entity8 to enter the euro			1
‘ the one thing that unites those who urged @entity8 to join the euro and those who advocate leaving the @entity9 is their shared conviction that any change is impossible and that there is no other way , ’ he said			1
‘ there is another way			0
it is time to change the @entity9 and to change @entity8 ’s relationship with it and then to place the decision in the hands of the @entity8 people			1
‘ @entity17 urgently needs economic reform			0
@entity61 integration is necessary for the euro to survive , but proper legal protection for the rights of non-euro members is absolutely necessary to preserve the single market and make it possible for @entity8 to remain in the @entity9			1
‘ i believe it is in no - one ’s interests for @entity8 to come to face a choice between joining the euro or leaving the @entity9			1
‘ we do n’t want to join the euro , but also our withdrawal from a @entity17 which succeeded in reforming would be bad for @entity8			2
decisive : the chancellor made the comments during a pan-european conference on @entity9 reform fittingly , @entity3 spoke under a portrait of the great @entity8 railway engineer @entity81 ‘ and a country of the size and global reach of @entity8 leaving would be very bad for the @entity9			1
’ mr @entity3 was speaking at a conference organised by the @entity88 group of conservative mps , who want a reformed relationship with @entity91 , and the @entity93 think tank			2
the @entity33 are backing a ‘ red card ’ system which would allow @entity8 to block any @entity9 proposal , or undo an existing law , if it won the support of a small number of other @entity9 countries			1
they are also examining a proposal by @entity102 , head of the @entity88 group and a member of the prime minister ’s policy board , that @entity8 should be given an effective veto over financial services @entity109 would allow a member state to block any proposal if a vital national interest is at stake – an argument which could apply to @entity8 ’s financial services industry , given its importance to the economy			2
mr @entity3 warned that from 2016 , under the terms of the @entity120 agreed by the last government , the @entity61 countries would be able to impose financial services legislation on nations across the @entity9			2
he said that @entity8 would demand reforms to ‘ protect the collective interests of non-eurozone member states ’			2
warning : mr @entity3 said that from 2016 , nations will be able to impose pan-european financial services laws mr @entity3 told the conference : ' over the last six years , the @entity17 economy has stalled			0
in the same period , the @entity132 economy has grown by a third , the @entity135 economy by 50 per cent ' mr @entity3 said there was a need for reform of the @entity9 , at a time when @entity17 is falling behind the rising economic powers of @entity141			2
he added that the financial crisis of 2008 had dramatically exposed the underlying weakness of the @entity17 economy			0
the chancellor said : ‘ we knew there was a competitiveness problem in @entity17 before the crisis			0
‘ but the crisis has dramatically accelerated the shifts in the tectonic economic plates that see power moving eastwards and southwards on our planet			0
over the last six years , the @entity17 economy has stalled			0
‘ in the same period , the @entity132 economy has grown by a third			0
‘ the @entity135 economy by 50 per cent			0
over the next 15 years @entity17 ’s share of global output is forecast to halve			0
’ @entity157 is refusing to back the idea of an in / out referendum			0
shadow foreign secretary @entity160 said : ‘ the conservative leadership seems to be spending more time negotiating with their backbenchers than negotiating with @entity17 to deliver real reform			0
’ but the @entity165 business group said mr @entity3 had set out a ‘ compelling ’ case , adding : ‘ a growing @entity9 is in the @entity8 ’s national interest so we must build alliances with other member states to get the reforms we need			1

chancellor claimed @entity9 relies heavy on the *strength* of the @entity8
he is demanding @entity9 reforms if @entity8 is to remain in the group of nations
