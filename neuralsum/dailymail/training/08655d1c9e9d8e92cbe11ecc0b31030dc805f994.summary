blame it on the alcohol : the top reason for unfaithful behaviour was revealed to be : ' i was drunk and things got out of control ' the other reasons were : ' i had cold feet and felt stressed about the wedding ' , ' i wanted to enjoy my last chance of freedom ' , ' i had a " hall pass " e.g. my partner agreed we could have a fling on our stag and hen dos , and ' i was pressurised by other attendees of the stag or hen do '			2
