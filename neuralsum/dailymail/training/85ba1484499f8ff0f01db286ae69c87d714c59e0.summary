@entity9 , a weight loss guru and presenter of tv show @entity10 ( left ) , believes the poor eating habits of @entity1 ( right ) are sending out the wrong message that eating unhealthy food makes people happy mr @entity9 , who has worked with overweight families for the last eight years , said : ‘ when i see cartoon characters and any promotion at all in the media that says you can be fat and happy and eat as much as you want , i will raise my concerns strongly			1
‘ i do n’t want people seeing @entity1 being fat , stuffing food in and being happy			2
what we should be doing is elevating the promotion of people who are happy and slim			2
‘ the reason i decided to write to him [ @entity17 ] is because i want to see @entity1 take up a realistic regime where he is determined to be fit , healthy and happy rather than fat and happy			0
‘ because that ’s the message i want to get to the nation			2
it ’s about giving children - our next generation - the right message			2
‘ being fat and happy do n’t go hand - in - hand because you are potentially putting yourself in danger			0
’ mr @entity9 , who once lost four stone himself , said he believes @entity1 should be put on his 80/20 eating plan – where you eat healthily 80 per cent of the time and have ‘ what you fancy ’ the other 20 per cent			1
he said : ‘ when it comes to role models , anyone in the media that ’s fat needs to really think about it because it ’s sending out the wrong message			1
‘ i am very anti size acceptance because we have to remember that being too fat can lead to significant health problems , including diabetes and cancer			0
mr @entity9 has written to @entity69 creator @entity17 ( pictured ) urging him to ' slim @entity1 down ' by putting him on a healthy eating plan			1
he believes it will help influence healthier eating habits across @entity3 ‘ i would love to see @entity1 go on a health regime that does n't mean he cuts out everything , but he lives my by 80/20 rule			1
‘ you eat well 80 per cent of the time and can have a bit of what you fancy the remaining 20 per cent of the week , but you watch the portion size			0
‘ as somebody who works full - time with fat people helping them to lose weight , it works really well			0
‘ i ’d love to see @entity1 take back control over food			2
because millions of people around the world watch the programme it would be such an inspirational message , especially to young people , that actually you can be fit and happy			0
‘ i 'm not saying lets get @entity1 on a ridiculous diet , lets do it realistically			0
the message it would put out would be fantastic			0
’ mr @entity9 , a hypnotherapist , also said he would like to see mr @entity17 put the cartoon character in hypnotherapy sessions to help him achieve weight loss			1
