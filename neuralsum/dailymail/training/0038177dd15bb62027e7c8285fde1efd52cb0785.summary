by @entity0 and @entity1 counter-terrorism experts have warned the threat of homegrown jihadists is growing as more @entity6 extremists , like @entity7 , take to social media to spread their ideologies			1
a spike in supporters for terror group @entity12 in @entity14 and posts relating to extremist views is a cause for concern , according to experts			1

the latest of these posts are a threat against a @entity50 doctor who spoke out against @entity7 and another jihadist @entity31 and an image of @entity7 's son holding a severed head			1
posted underneath these taunts are messages of support for the jihadists from @entity58 , and have spawned messages of support online			0
one of them was from a physical education teacher residing in @entity63 who wrote on @entity65 accompanied by pictures of @entity7 : ' he was a good brother the area surely misses him			2

despite the rise in online chatter from jihad supporters , @entity14 's security threat level has not shifted from ' medium ' - meaning an attack could happened - and counter-terrorism experts say the most significant concern facing the nation is a ' lone - wolf ' attack			1
these types of attacks are similar to the @entity96 bombings or the attack on @entity99 soldier @entity98 who was hacked to death , according to @entity103 's @entity102			0
' if they ’ve got the savvy to plan something quietly without telling their mates , they may well pull something off , ' he told @entity112			0
' i think we just have to accept that we might be lucky and not see that happen but there ’s certainly enough intent and serious association that someone in this larger network might try to do something			0

it is now looking at introducing more legislation to combat this issue , including people travelling to areas where terror groups are operating to justify their trips			2

' and it can only be done by a very sick person '			0
dr @entity33 , a prominent member of @entity58 's @entity6 community , was a finalist in the 2009 @entity207 awards			0
he said he was familiar with @entity7 's father but had never met the younger @entity7 who has turned to terrorism			2

he was a founding member of @entity214 and the @entity215			0
