he would not disclose the victim 's nationality , or say how he had sustained the injuries			0

in all , 77 people received medical treatment including 13 who were seriously injured , he said			0
criticised : @entity71 agencies and human rights organisations have called for the camps to be closed down due to the living conditions for the refugees tension : the camp , pictured in july last year , houses around 1,300 men from countries including @entity39 , @entity42 's @entity41 region , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , and @entity48 @entity32 initially said the injuries had occurred outside the camp but later said he was uncertain whether the fatal injuries had been inflicted within the camp or outside , adding that local authorities are investigating the matter			2
