by @entity0 published : 05:52 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 05:55 est , 19 march 2012 astronomers who scan the skies for dangerous asteroids – space rocks that might cross the @entity6 ’s path – are in line for a huge funding boost from @entity9			1
the @entity11 space agency is awarding $ 4.1 million ( £ 2.6m ) to the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , based at the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , to upgrade its search capabilities			1
most will consider this money well spent , since some asteroids , were they to crash land on @entity6 , would be capable of causing global devastation			1
ever watchful : the @entity12 's @entity19 scans the skies for dangerous space rocks the money will be used to upgrade and operate the @entity12 telescopes through to 2015			1
the @entity12 program , part of the @entity13 's @entity26 , has led the search for so - called near - @entity6 objects , or @entity29 , since 2005			1
@entity12 consists of two wide - field survey telescopes and a dedicated follow - up telescope located in the @entity12 mountains north of @entity33 , @entity34			1
@entity35 's the limit : the @entity19 is located on @entity37			0
@entity38 in the @entity39 just north of @entity33 , @entity34 in 2011 the @entity12 science team discovered 586 near - @entity6 asteroids , representing 65 per cent of @entity29 discoveries for the year			1
in addition to its record - setting searches for asteroids , the team was the first to observe an asteroid on a collision course with the @entity6 , allowing it to be tracked and eventually recovered as meteorites in the desert of @entity51			1
their large and growing data set has also found new relevance in the search for objects far beyond the solar system			2
with their new grant , @entity12 astronomers will be able to expand the power of their largest telescope four-fold , develop more sensitive software , and conduct their search more nights every month			1
‘ @entity9 has recognised that over the last seven years , our program has constantly strived to improve its performance , and has collaborated with others to find new ways to exploit the nearly 1,000 images we take every night with our two telescopes in the mountains north of @entity33 , ’ said @entity65 , principal investigator of the @entity12			1
‘ i think @entity9 recognises the @entity12 as a valuable service to , well , humanity			1
’ to spot @entity29 , @entity12 observers use two telescopes to take four images of selected portions of the sky , spaced about 10 minutes apart			2
@entity80 then processes the images , looking for faint objects that appear to be moving across the sky in a straight line			0
specialised software then removes known asteroids , applies filters to remove false detections and presents the results to the observer for final validation			0
asteroids suspected of qualifying as @entity29 are reported to the @entity94 for analysis and follow - up images are scheduled			2
it takes several hours of such observations to reveal whether an object is an neo			0
finally , objects whose orbits intersect with the @entity6 's are called out for additional study by amateur and professional astronomers around the world			2
a key element of the new grant , a more powerful camera will allow the project to cover more sky with the 1.5 - meter telescope on the summit of @entity37			0
@entity12 co-investigator @entity113 , who designed the new camera , said : ‘ when we began observing in 2000 , our image sensor was 16 megapixels , which was large by any standard			2
today , commonly available consumer digital cameras have surpassed that size , and we were reaching the limit of productivity with our current camera design			0
’ a few years ago , @entity123 , a local vendor of scientific imaging systems , presented a sensor totalling 110 megapixels			0
together with @entity33 - based optical designer @entity127 , @entity113 developed a powerful new camera system that would increase the amount of sky it can cover each month by four times			0
danger : some asteroids have the destructive power of nuclear bombs ‘ we believe this will translate into a nearly proportional increase in the number of discoveries we make each month , ’ @entity113 said			0
the grant will facilitate other enhancements too , such as support additional software development to improve the speed and sensitivity of the @entity12 software , and the addition of a new observer that will allow them to work more nights each month			2
the @entity12 program is not limited to the search for asteroids			1
a spinoff project called the @entity158 makes further use of the data acquired for the asteroid survey			0
‘ we image the entire sky every month with our telescope on @entity38 , ’ @entity65 said , ‘ in partnership with colleagues at @entity167 who had developed software to search for changes in the stationary cosmic objects			0
almost as fast as we can acquire the data , they are able to detect changes in the brightness of stars and galaxies that can reveal important clues about objects millions of times farther away than the asteroids we search for			0

the @entity12 in @entity34 found 586 near - @entity6 asteroids last year
