by @entity0 there is a dimension to the harnessing of @entity4 to @entity5 which stretches far beyond @entity6 , higher even than the utmost reaches of the @entity8 to which this middling club merrily aspires			1
here is the next @entity12 management team in waiting			1
if the wheels on @entity15 ’s bandwagon fall off a second time , come in ‘ @entity17 and @entity18			1
perfect partnership : @entity5 has appointed @entity4 to his staff at @entity6 tricky period : @entity15 needs to hit the ground running to stave off any talk over his future as boss @entity5 was the people ’s alternative the last time the @entity27 went fishing for a national team boss			1
@entity4 might still have been in the job had he not given public airing to his unorthodox religious opinions			1
the @entity27 plumped for the coaching intelligence which has always been @entity15 ’s stock in trade and has been enriched by a wealth of experience abroad			1
that was preferred to the quick - witted , inspirational man - management style of @entity5			2
@entity4 , however , is a thoughtful tactician and if he and @entity5 hit it off in @entity41 ’s @entity40 the temptation will arise , sooner or later , for @entity12 to see in that partnership the best of both worlds			1
the bad cop and the @entity47 cop , the tongue - lasher and the quiet talker , the backside - kicker and the gentle persuader			2
more and more in the world of football it takes two to tango and this pair are each other ’s alter - egos			2
most importantly , @entity5 and @entity4 each bring something to the party which is different from the other			1
dismal : @entity12 were eliminated from the @entity63 in @entity64 this summer after just two group games new era : the @entity12 needs leadership after the international retirement of captain @entity69 @entity5 has no problem admitting as much			1
he is talking openly about @entity4 revolutionising the tactics of a @entity6 team which his own street-wise instincts dragged to the @entity8 by its bootlaces last season			2
where @entity5 was born and bred to 4 - 4 - 2 , @entity4 was an early convert to the 3 - 5 - 2 system which has been finding favour in the foreign leagues for some years , becoming more prevalent during this @entity64 @entity63 summer and is preferred by new @entity82 manager @entity81			1
@entity4 flirted with that conversion during his spell as @entity12 manager which was brought to an abrupt end after he made known his apparent belief that the disabled are being punished from on high for misbehaviour in previous lives			1
no amount of dissembling could get him off that hook but he has found out for himself now that time not only heals but makes men wiser			0
wrong decisions : while manager of @entity12 , @entity4 handled @entity97 poorly @entity5 , by contrast , would have handled the maverick @entity97 more cleverly			1
@entity4 , in the heat of an unseemly ruckus , expelled @entity101 from @entity12 ’s @entity63 squad for @entity103 98 , not realising how sensible it would have been to keep that genius on hand in case the day came when he was needed			1
inevitably it did , as @entity5 would have known			0
just as he can see the attraction in a pairing of opposites with @entity4			2
@entity15 , having survived after @entity63 2014 elimination inside two matches , has the acumen to turn his and @entity12 ’s fortunes around for @entity116 , for which the qualifying fixtures are about to commence			1
but there are no certainties at international level and , by a neat twist of the draw , that campaign opens with an away match against the @entity125 , who he turned into awkward tournament rivals during a spell as their national manager			0
video staying in the @entity8 is the main aim - @entity5 talking tactics : @entity6 are set to change their formation under the guidance of @entity4 this season the @entity27 are pleading patience for a decent man and that is not unreasonable			1
but unless @entity12 ’s results improve in the immediate @entity141 era , @entity15 knows how fierce the public backlash will be			1
whenever that clamour becomes irresistible the most difficult question to answer is always who should get the job next			0
by the time @entity12 ’s fate in the @entity148 unfolds , @entity5 and @entity4 could well be the most popular answer			1
this wednesday has marked the tenth anniversary of the opening ceremony for the @entity152			0
the days and weeks prior to this landmark have been notable for damning photographs and reports of the state of neglect into which the venues have fallen			0
many have also sought to blame the cost of the @entity161 for @entity163 ’s dire economic crisis			0
dossier : @entity165 - the @entity166 of @entity152 – has commissioned a study into the real costs now the remarkable woman who drove through the completion of construction and a of myriad other preparations in time to deliver a highly acclaimed games – to the chagrin of all the doomsayers who predicted @entity176 would never be ready – is fighting back			2
@entity165 – the first lady of @entity177 and as such the @entity166 of @entity176 – has commissioned a forensic study into the real costs as well as the full extent of the benefits to the city			0
@entity165 , who almost killed herself working 20 hours a day to get @entity176 built in less days than seemed humanly possible when she took over a failing operation , is a formidable foe			0
she also has influential friends			0
president @entity187 is just one global powerbroker who has endorsed her new book - about the struggle to save the @entity161 - as inspirational			2
@entity165 has instructed the highly respected @entity190 ‘ to conduct a detailed and scientific investigation into the overall impact of the @entity161 ’			0
while there can be no disputing the dramatic pictorial evidence of venues such as the @entity197 pool , the rowing centre , the stadium itself and the canoeing facility being in sorry disrepair , @entity165 denies that is the full story			0
where 's the legacy ? reports of the state of neglect into which the venues have fallen have been damning that , she and her allies insist , is to be found in the transformation of @entity176 into a modern @entity213 capital by the @entity161			2
against every rundown venue she can cite the bustling shopping mall which used to be the @entity216 , the badminton hall which is now a regularly - packed theatre and a majority of other sites which have been sold off			2
when it comes down to the hard cash , @entity165 is confident that a significant percentage of the reported £ 6.8billion spent on the @entity197 and @entity224 will be found to have been invested in roads , tramways , hospitals , hotels and the long overdue restoration of fabled archaeological sites			0
no backing down now : @entity165 is insistent that the @entity161 were a success and helped @entity163 even by the most extravagant estimates the @entity161 can not be held accountable for more than one per cent of the @entity163 national debt			0
in return for that , this ancient capital has been rejuvenated as a contemporary showcase for its historic past			0
@entity239 is the @entity197 buzz - word but in the narrow terms of the stadia it is arguable that @entity176 is no worse off than @entity244 , while the infrastructure of that city hardly benefited			2
and whither @entity248 , it is being asked , eight years from now ? the @entity176 study is due for publication ‘ before the end of this year			0
’ then , let the fun and games begin			0
my @entity163 drama , by @entity165 , @entity256 at @entity257 - $ 26.95 @entity258 has just launched his foundation at a star - studded dinner in @entity261			1
@entity263 ’s two - time world champion boxer and @entity152 silver medallist is giving back by supporting many charities for impoverished children , notably funding orphanages in deprived parts of the world as well as providing for under - privileged youngsters in @entity271			0
want to help ? @entity272 the @entity273			0
the man himself expects to be back in the ring this december , still with an eye on a mega-fight with @entity279 in @entity280 next may			0
giving something back : @entity258 has just launched his foundation at a star - studded dinner in @entity261			1

@entity15 could come under *scrutiny* during the @entity116 *qualifiers*
@entity4 's reign as @entity12 boss ended after ill - *advised* public opinions
@entity258 has just launched his foundation at a star - studded dinner
