@entity5 gov. @entity4 showed his pop culture chops and channeled the @entity8 rivalry on a @entity10 video posted on his page			1
in the three minute video , @entity4 is thwarted , time and time again by @entity15 mayor @entity14 , who last month rescued a neighbour from a burning building			1

‘ you guys got any problems you want me to handle , like a fire anywhere , people trapped ? ’ the @entity5 governor asks			0
‘ maybe a cat in a tree ? ’ the trooper shakes his head and tells him there is nothing happening			0
moments later , @entity14 turns up and assuredly tells @entity4 : ‘ governor , i got this ! ’ @entity60 : @entity8 , a disgruntled postal worker , and @entity62 had an embattled relationship throughout the long - running @entity65 series i got this : @entity14 popped up everywhere , and even helped @entity4 change a flat tire on his car - only enraging the @entity37 governor , who muttered ' @entity14 ' in @entity8 fashion when @entity73 gets a flat , there @entity14 is , telling him ' i got this ' with jack in hand			1
@entity14 later helps @entity78 replace a missing guitar ( ‘ i always carry a spare ’ ) and @entity81 after catching a baby dropped from a state @entity83 balcony before @entity4 's eyes			1
each time , @entity4 grits his teeth and laments : ' @entity14 ! ' @entity14 is then shown on a phone telling @entity89 he would n't make a good running mate , saying : ‘ yes , that was me running into the fire			1
yes , i do shovel snow as well			0
‘ yes , you ’re very persuasive , but i ’m not a number two guy			0
i ’m not a background singer			0
’ @entity4 grabs the receiver , saying : ' excuse me mayor , i got this			2
' @entity8 and @entity102 had a tumultuous relationship throughout the entirely of the @entity65 comedy			1
the jaded postal worker , played by @entity106 , was always coming up with schemes to outdo neighbour @entity8			2
at the ready : @entity14 offered @entity78 an extra guitar face off : while @entity4 could n't keep up with @entity14 's good deeds , @entity14 conversely was no match for playing veep to @entity89 the @entity5 governor has had his fair share of comedy in the past month			1
at the @entity117 ’ dinner last month , host @entity115 singled out @entity4 for his waistline			2
@entity115 had joked : ‘ you know , they say that inside every @entity121 governor is a president struggling to get out			0
in @entity4 ’s case , it ’s the only one where you can still hear him screaming			2
’ but the jokes did n’t ’ stop there			0
@entity115 said : ‘ gov. @entity4 , i think you might be misunderstanding @entity5 ’s slogan – it ’s not the @entity132			2
’ not to be outdone , @entity4 fired back a few days after the dinner , saying : ‘ ( when you have @entity134 ) next to you do console you … you do n’t care what the heck @entity115 said			0
’ the @entity138 actress shared a table with him during the night ’s festivities			0
jokers : @entity14 and @entity4 have always had a jovial relationship - here , they 're pictured in 2011 sharing a laugh last laugh : at last month 's @entity147 , @entity115 poked fun at @entity4 's weight , but the governor fired back , saying he was at least sitting next to @entity134 watch videos here :			1
