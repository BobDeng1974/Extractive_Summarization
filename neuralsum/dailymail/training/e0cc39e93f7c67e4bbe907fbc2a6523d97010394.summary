introduced to the world in 2009 , @entity0 was hailed as the most fearsome of all prehistoric creatures			1
an immense , big - headed marine reptile - said to have been 50ft long with a bite four times more powerful as @entity7 - spawned a host of excited commentary , documentaries and even a b - movie			1
now , four years after the initial discovery of the beast 's fossilised remains , @entity0 has finally been given a technical description and a name - and it seems the hype overreached the facts			1
fearsome : an artist 's impression of @entity0 , who has now been fully studied and named @entity0 by the team who discovered its remains in the @entity25 island of @entity26 a team from the @entity28 uncovered two big pliosaurs - short - necked , large jawed marine reptiles - between 2004 and and 2012 on the @entity25 island of @entity26			1
previously the only pliosaur remains found on the island was a section of tail vertebra , so the find was hailed as a major discovery			0
the specimen dubbed @entity0 got greater fame , while the other enjoyed five minutes in the spotlight as @entity41			2
writing in the @entity46 , palaeontologists @entity43 , @entity44 , and @entity45 have now named the creatures @entity0 , and they admit the remains of both only offer partial views of what this marine apex predator was like alive			1
@entity26 's regular freeze - thaw cycles have severely fragmented the fossilised skeletons , the trio reports , and some parts further degraded as they dried them out in the lab. in the case of the specimen used as the basis of the new species , known as @entity62 , the surviving material consist of only a few fragments of jaw , some vertebrae from the neck and the back , and parts of the right front flipper			2
the second , larger specimen - @entity62 214.136 - includes parts of the back of the skull , a few vertebrae and ' several fragmentary and unidentified bones '			0
fossilised : this image shows a section of snout belonging to specimen @entity62 214.135 from two angles			0
yellow shading indicates dentary teeth , red shading indicates premaxillary teeth and numbers indicate tooth number fragment : this shows a part of the same specimen 's lower jaw with the same key study : cervical centrum from @entity62 shown in articular ( @entity95 ) and lateral ( @entity97 ) view , and a second cervical centrum from the same specimen in lateral view ( @entity102 ) flaky : @entity104 vertebrae from @entity62 214.135			0
@entity26 's regular freeze - thaw cycles have severely fragmented the fossilised skeletons and some parts further degraded as researchers dried them out in the lab ancient : a piece of dorsal centrum from @entity62 seen from two angles bone structure : four dorsal vertebral centra and three associated neural arches ( shaded yellow , orange , and red ) from @entity62 marine reptile : right coracoid from the specimen in ventral view			1
a fault ( red dashed line ) runs obliquely across the coracoid			0
several dorsal ribs ( shaded orange ) lie dorsally to the coracoid			0
the posterior part was reconstructed based on a preserved element , which was displaced along a fault the same fragment seen in dorsal view : several gastralia ( shaded yellow ) lie on the dorsal side of the coracoid aquatic : the specimen 's right front paddle , showing @entity139 and epipodials in dorsal view ( a ) , and the humerus in proximal view ( @entity102 ) fingers : the phalanges of the right front paddle of @entity62 shown in ventral view efforts to figure out the size of @entity0 were complicated by this incomplete nature of the remains , with the palaeontologists only able to estimate the size of their specimens based on measurements of other pliosaurs			1
both creatures had originally been estimated at a monstrous 50ft long - making them the biggest pliosaurs ever found , according to professor @entity45 when he announced the discovery			1
the new paper shrinks the beast somewhat			0
now the palaeontologists estimate the complete skull of @entity165 to have been between about six and eight feet long - big , yes , but comparable to the size of at least one other known pliosaur			0
the skull of the other specimen was smaller at between five and six - and - a - half feet long , which is still impressive but within the range of what researchers have previously found			0
the beast : partial basioccipital including the occipital condyle of specimen @entity62 214.136 - aka @entity0 - shown in right lateral ( a ) , posterior ( @entity102 ) and dorsal ( c ) views massive : left posterior jaw fragment of @entity0 seen in in lateral ( a ) and oblique posterior ( @entity102 ) view conjecture : what researchers believe to be the left surangular of @entity0 in what they think are the dorsal ( a ) and lateral ( @entity102 ) views inconclusive : anterior cervical vertebral centrum of @entity0 in what is thought to be anterior articular ( a ) , left lateral ( @entity102 ) and ventral ( c ) views making good estimates of body length is more complicated still			1
guessing the size of pliosaurs is notoriously difficult since many species are known only from fragmentary remains , with palaeontologists forced to estimate size based on bones thought to act as a proxy for overall length			2
on the basis of measurements of the creatures ' vertebrae , the @entity212 team 's educated guess is that @entity0 was between about 33 to 42ft long , putting them squarely in the same size range as the largest specimens previously known to science			2
back - pedalling from the hype surrounding to discovery of @entity0 , they now describe their specimen as merely ' one of the largest pliosaurs described so far '			1
with so many gaps in the evidence , the view of @entity0 remains incomplete			2
nevertheless it seems @entity26 's pliosaur fossils are not nearly so big or spectacular as had been hoped			0
indeed , the palaeontologists now ' urge caution in drawing far - reaching conclusions of pliosaur ecology and behaviour ' based on their findings .			0

prehistoric marine reptile first announced in 2009 when it was *claimed* to be biggest and most fearsome of all pliosaurs
it spawned reams of commentary , documentaries and even a b - movie
but now research shows @entity0 was not as massive and fearsome as first thought
