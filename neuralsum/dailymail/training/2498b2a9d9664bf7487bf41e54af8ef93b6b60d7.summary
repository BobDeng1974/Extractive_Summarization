by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:52 am on 16th january 2012 a new generation of skin creams hailed as the ‘ holy grail ’ of anti-ageing has received more than 5,000 pre-orders in the @entity7 alone - a week before they even go on sale			1
the @entity10 cream uses science to ‘ trick ’ the skin into regenerating by artificially boosting levels of glycans , complex sugars that play a crucial role in the structure of healthy skin			1
experts in ‘ glycomics ’ or glycobiology - the study of glycans - say they are vital to maintaining the body ’s systems but decline in old age , with the skin particularly effected			1
the @entity10 range ' tricks ' the skin into regenerating by artificially boosting levels of glycans the study of the sugars was dubbed ‘ one of the ten emerging technologies that would change the world ’ by journal @entity41 in 2003 , and it has already led to the development of the @entity37 vaccine against fatal infant flu			1
but it is also vital for the skin , @entity44 parent company @entity43 says			2
researchers have found that by synthesising glycans and boosting the levels of three types of the sugar can give the skin greater thickness and elasticity			2
a @entity43 spokeswoman said : ' at our research department the race is on to work out the glycome - all the glycans - of skin because glycans are the key to skin health and regeneration			2
' to develop the new @entity10 range , @entity43 enlisted the help of chemist professor @entity67 , of the @entity68			1
smooth : experts in ' glycomics ' say they decline in old age , with the skin particularly effected in two years of research he found that glycans have a role to play in almost every aspect of what skin looks like and also discovered the number of glycans in our skin diminishes with age , meaning cells no longer receive the messages they need to maintain youthful - looking skin			0
the team realised that by artificially raise the levels of glycans in older skin , you could trick it into behaving like younger skin			1
the glycan combination , known as @entity95 , has been patented and the firm says it is the first time glycobiology has been applied to skincare			0
in self tests on 50 women , 88 per cent said their skin looked more luminous while 72 per cent said fine lines appeared less visible			0
@entity43 says that more than 5000 @entity7 women have already registered to order the cream , which goes on sale next week			0
@entity105 , general manager of @entity10 , said : ' this is one of the most amazing scientific breakthroughs we have discovered in relation to anti-aging			2
' the products are set to be the holy grail of anti-aging for many women given their proven efficacy			0
' glycobiology is opening up a whole new area of possibilities when it comes to skincare			0
“ we ’re just at the very start of it and are already excited			0
