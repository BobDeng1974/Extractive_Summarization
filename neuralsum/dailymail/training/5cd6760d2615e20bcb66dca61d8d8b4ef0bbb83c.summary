by @entity0 published : 19:59 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 04:23 est , 16 august 2013 abduction victim @entity1 has been seen in public for the first time since she was rescued by federal agents less than a week ago			1
the 16 - year - old wore sunglasses , a blue top and short jean shorts as she attended a fundraiser with friends and supporters in @entity12 , @entity13 less than a week after her ordeal ended			0
it comes as questions remain over what exactly happened when she was kidnapped by @entity20 , a family friend who killed her mother and brother before abducting her and taking her to @entity24 where @entity26 officers shot him dead			1
@entity62 county sheriff @entity61 has been adamant that @entity1 was an unwilling victim from start to finish			2
" i ca n't make it any clearer , " he said at a news conference monday			0
she has spoken to friends and strangers over social media and released a number of pictures of herself via her @entity73 account but the first time she was seen publicly came thursday evening when she went to a fundraiser for her family			0
her mother @entity30 and 6 - year - old brother @entity78 were killed and their bodies were set on fire by their family friend @entity82 , who ' tricked ' them into coming to his home and then killed the mother and brother before running off with @entity1 and being shot dead six days later			1
@entity1 was only briefly seen walking from their car into the back entrance of a @entity62 restaurant where the fundraiser was being held			2
support : her father said that she is happy to be home and among friends @entity1 's appearance at the fundraiser comes the same day as a growing list of evidence recovered at @entity20 's house has been revealed , including firebombs , military assault rifle ammunition , and handwritten ' letters from @entity104 ' to @entity20			1
one of the most puzzling pieces added to the ongoing investigation into this crime is that a dna test kit was found in the burnt out car that once belonged to @entity110			1
@entity111 reports that other items listed in the search warrants released today include ' crow bars and other weapons , instruments and objects capable of inflicting blunt force trauma ' , as well as bomb - making materials like gas cans , various types of duct tape and arson wire			1
a number of personal items that could potentially be used for dna collection were also gathered , including clothing and toothbrushes but also used condoms			0
the meaning behind the items was not listed , as emergency responders appear to have grabbed as many items as possible on august 5 as they tried to get a better idea of @entity1 's relationship with @entity20 as they were missing			1
what remained : firefighters found the bodies of @entity30 and @entity31 covered with tarp , showing that they were killed before the fire that burnt down @entity82 's @entity141 ( pictured ) the 13 calls between @entity20 and @entity1 on the day of her abduction remain curious , though @entity145 's spokeswoman @entity144 said that they may have been discussing what time she needed to be picked up from cheerleading practice			1
today , @entity1 did not make a statement to the awaiting press , but her father @entity150 came outside and made a statement , saying that his daughter was happy to be home			2
' she 's with her family and of course with some friends and she 's just happy to be here , ' he said thursday			0
' @entity1 sends her love and she keeps moving day by day			2
' the fundraiser was largely attended by relatives and friends within their neighborhood , and mr @entity31 cited their strong support as helping them through			0
' this is a small community that we 're a part of and they really came together ... this is how @entity12 rolls , ' he said			0
he also said that he has spoken with the four horseback riders who spotted @entity1 in the @entity24 woods with @entity20 and called police			2
' it was a chance encounter but it did save my daughter 's life , ' he said			0
@entity177 turned spokesman : @entity150 stepped outside and said a few words , telling how he was so thankful for the national support that helped lead to his daughter 's rescue spreading the love : @entity150 said he spoke with the four horsemen who spotted @entity1 with @entity20 and called police , leading to her recovery the fundraiser came the day after a search warrant revealed that @entity1 's mother and brother were both killed and tortured before @entity20 's cabin set on fire			1
a police report that describes the scene that firefighters found when they responded to the call about @entity20 's cabin being burnt to ashes in @entity141 , @entity13 on august 5th			1
they found the bodies covered with tarp , and a crowbar lying next to @entity30			0
when the responders went to the garage to check for more victims , they found the @entity31 's deceased dog and noted that it had blood near its head			0
the details surrounding the nature of the bodies are scant , but the fact that the humans were draped with tarp before the firefighters got there - and that there was blood coming from the dog 's head - implies that they were all killed before the fire ravaged the home .			0

abduction victim was seen attending a fundraiser for her family , making it her first public outing since being freed less than a week ago
comes the same day as new search warrants made public that list piles of evidence that the first responders collected at @entity20 's burnt house
' @entity240 ' among the evidence at her kidnapper 's house , along with ' possible blunt force weapons ' and bomb making materials
@entity1 's mother @entity30 had a dna test in her burnt car , raising more questions about their relationship
