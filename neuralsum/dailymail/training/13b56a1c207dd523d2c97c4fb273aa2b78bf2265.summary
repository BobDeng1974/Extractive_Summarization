by @entity0 published : 06:57 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 19:57 est , 6 december 2012 after decades of embarrassing the neighbours , the scruffiest house in @entity2 has , well , turned over a new leaf			0
the previous owner went 20 years without trimming the ivy that covered the outside of the property – until eventually it started to invade the inside too			2
by the time the house went on the market last year , it had an asking price of just £ 120,000 in a street where better - kept homes often fetch three times as much			1
engulfed : @entity18 covered the entire front of the house , including the garden and the wall , and had become a ' tourist attraction ' in the area but fortunately for fed - up residents , the new owner was not so content to rest on his laurels			0
the house has been stripped of the ivy , renovated inside and out at a cost of tens of thousands , and is now up for sale for £ 350,000			1
hard work : once all the ivy had been removed from the outside and inside of the house , the owner faced thousands of pounds of further refurbishment to make it inhabitable extreme home makeover : after massive restoration work , the house is now for sale for £ 350,000 - nearly three times the original price one neighbour said : ‘ we are so relieved			1
' people would stop their cars to stare at it and whilst it may have looked amusing , i honestly believe it was having an impact on the house prices along the road			0
’ it took a team of workmen more than a week just to strip the ivy from the three - bedroom house in @entity59 , @entity60 , after insurance company chairman @entity61 bought it in august last year			1
at the time , he said : ‘ i could not even see the house – just a house shape underneath the ivy			0
' there was as much ivy on the inside as well so the house was completely dark , with no lights and no power			0
’ then : the ivy - covered house looks tattered and scruffy next to the neighbours now : with the ivy removed the house has nearly trebled in value , much to the joy of both owner and neighbours before : @entity79 were complaining that the ' @entity80 ' was dragging down the value of their properties after : the house now matches the others built in the same style on the street			2

the ' @entity80 ' is on the market for £ 350,000 after makeover
the @entity59 property went up for sale for £ 120,000 last year
