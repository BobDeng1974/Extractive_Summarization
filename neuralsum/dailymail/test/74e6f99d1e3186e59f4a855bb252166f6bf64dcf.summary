@entity0 today announced plans to give millions of workers three days paid leave a year to do volunteer work			1
the prime minister said he will amend the @entity6 regulations so for three days people can volunteer or serve as a school governor , and get paid in addition to their 28 days of paid holiday			1
but business leaders criticised the move as heavy - handed government intervention ' , amid doubts about how the policy would be paid for			2
volunteers would be able to take the time to volunteer in a block or flexibly			0
announcing the policy mr @entity0 said : ' this election is about building a better future for our children and grandchildren			1
the foundation stone of that better future is our economic security			0
but conservatives know the society we build on top of that is just as important too			0
' this is the clearest demonstration of the @entity24 in action - and i 'm proud it 's a @entity51 government that will deliver it			1
' but @entity53 , director general of the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) , criticised the announcement , saying the policy did not appear to have been thought through			2
' many , many businesses are already highly engaged in their local community and with charitable causes , and the @entity54 thoroughly supports them			0
passing a law to compel firms to pay their staff to volunteer for charity is hardly in keeping with the spirit of philanthropy			0
' businesses should support their staff if they want to volunteer , but the architects of this idea can not pretend that forcing firms to give an additional three days of paid leave will do anything other than add costs			2
time off for charity work and volunteering is a matter for managers and employees to discuss between themselves , not a target for heavy - handed government intervention			2
' this announcement not only undermines the @entity51 record on reducing business regulation , it also puts additional pressure on public sector employers , and ultimately the taxpayer			0
frankly , the essence of volunteering is that it is voluntary			0
the @entity54 would welcome proposals to incentivise and make it easier for companies to facilitate volunteering , but it has to be a choice			0
' mr @entity0 's plan will affect around 15 million workers across @entity99 in private and public sectors survival expert and @entity103 star @entity101 said that he supports mr @entity0 's volunteering scheme the plan was praised by the chairman of @entity108 @entity107			1
he said : ' corporate volunteering is a triple win - a win for the community , a win for individuals doing the volunteering , and a win for companies			0
' survival expert and tv star @entity101 also lent mr @entity0 his support for the scheme			1
' any initiative that encourages people to volunteer is good news , ' he said			0
' all of us struggle to find extra time and that 's why to have firm government support that enables millions to volunteer is a huge step forward towards building solid communities all around the @entity132			0
' however , just hours after @entity0 's announcement , communities secretary @entity133 said companies would not be forced to organise paid time - off for their employees , suggesting the policy would be unworkable			1
' nobody is forcing anybody to volunteer and no one is forcing companies to organise this volunteering if it causes problems to the company , ' mr @entity133 told @entity146 's today programme			1
he added there would need to be ' a bit of give and take ' with the prime minister 's plan			1
the communities secretary insisted it would not add to costs in the @entity154 , with potential gaps having to be filled by extra agency workers			0
' we 're talking about three days and it would be worked out according to patterns of work and it will be worked out to ensure that it does n't cause inconvenience to the health service , ' he said			2
the former deputy prime minister @entity164 said mr @entity133 had given a ' car crash ' interview			1
he tweeted : ' if yesterday 's @entity168 interview was a car crash , @entity133 just caused a motorway pile - up # r4today			1
' mr @entity133 suggested companies would not be forced to give staff days - off for volunteering under the plan former deputy prime minister @entity164 offered his view on @entity133 ' interview on the today programme the @entity177 raised concerns about the cost of the policy			1
shadow minister @entity181 said : ' this is a re-announcement from @entity0 that has unravelled before it 's even been made			2
' giving every public servant three extra days off could cost millions of pounds but there 's no sense of how it will be paid for			2
if just half of public sector workers took this up it would be the time equivalent of around 2,000 nurses , 800 police and almost 3,000 teachers			0

he described announcement as demonstration of the @entity24 in action
