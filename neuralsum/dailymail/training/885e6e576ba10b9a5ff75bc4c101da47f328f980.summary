by @entity0 published : 04:27 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 09:49 est , 5 june 2013 the girl at the centre of the child cruelty trial told the @entity4 she went along with her mother ’s shocking attempts to get her pregnant because she thought : ‘ if i do this			1
maybe she will love me more			0
’ the girl had been adopted as a baby and raised in a ‘ toxic cocoon ’ of her mother ’s making – an atmosphere of intimidation and disapproval behind the closed curtains of their terrace house			1
despite the bullying and coercion , the girl remained pathetically devoted to her adopted mother and obeyed her commands , driven by a powerful mix of fear and love			1
authorities missed four significant opportunities which may have prevented a woman from forcing her adopted daughter to impregnate herself with sperm bought on the internet in a moment of unbearable poignancy the girl , known only as a , told how she had gone along with her mother ’s plans to win the woman ’s affection			1
she told the @entity4 : ‘ @entity41 said to me , “ a , the only way i can have a fourth child is for you to get pregnant ”			1
‘ i was shocked , pretty shocked at first			0
and then i suddenly thought , “ maybe if i do this then everything will be over			0
@entity41 will be happy like she was before ”			2
‘ and i also thought from a selfish point of view , “ if i do this			2
maybe she will love me more ”			0
’ @entity49 was only 13 when her mother revealed her plans , and just 14 when the humiliating and painful ordeal of the insemination ‘ programme ’ began			2
in march 2009 , aged 15 and having already suffered a miscarriage , she sent a @entity57 card			2
the girl wrote : ‘ @entity59 ( the things i can not give you but would if i could )			2
’ she stuck photographs of her mother ’s favourite singers and television programmes on the card			0
below them , next to a photograph of a positive pregnancy test , she wrote : ‘ and the one thing that i can			0
’ remarkably , @entity49 told the court hearing she was grateful to her mother for adopting her and her sisters , saying : ‘ my mum has done as much as she could to give us a good and happy life			2
’ but mr @entity76 heard the mother had excluded her ex-husband from her daughters ’ life and had schooled them at home , leaving them isolated from the world outside			0
she could be ‘ critical , rigid , suspicious and obsessive ’ , the judge said , adding : ‘ for the children , who love her deeply , the threat of her disapproval is always in the air			0
’ eldest daughter a in particular had coped with her domineering mother by becoming submissive to her , even dropping her voice so she could barely be heard			2
@entity92 said she was so quiet and timid that they had wondered if she had a ‘ vocal disability ’			0
remarkably , it was only by becoming a mother herself that @entity49 found the strength to stand up to the maternal bullying she had suffered			2
midwives noticed that she refused to hand her baby son to her mother , and she rejected the woman ’s demands that she call him @entity105 , instead choosing a traditional @entity107 name			2
astonished : family judge mr @entity76 expressed his ' abiding sense of disbelief ' in a @entity4 judgement fears for her son ’s wellbeing finally drove her to confide in a family friend , an act of courage and defiance she had been unable to make on her own behalf			0
a , now 19 and living in a foster home with her toddler son , told the court : ‘ i was scared to go home , because i knew i would n’t be able to raise him as my child and i was scared at how my mum might raise him			1
’ her mother , an educated and highly articulate woman , also gave the teenager recordings to listen to which contained subliminal messages , saying : ‘ i am going to conceive a girl			2
’ the girl , who was adopted , had not wanted to become pregnant but was terrified of jeopardising hermother ’s love for her			2
the plan fell apart after the girl gave birth to a boy and midwives at the hospital became suspiciousof her mother ’s ‘ pushy and insensitive ’ behaviour towards her and the baby , and raised the alarm			1
the @entity147 can reveal that social workers were warned three times about the mother , but decided her children were not at risk			1
on one occasion a social worker closed the case after speaking to the mother on the telephone , without even visiting the family ’s home or seeing the children			1
the mother , a 48 - year - old former nanny , was jailed for five years for bullying her daughter into the surrogate pregnancy plan and for cruelty towards another of her adopted children			1
the case raises worrying questions about the regulation of adoptions from abroad and the sale of donor sperm over the internet			0
the @entity4 case was heard in secret but can be reported following a legal challenge by media groups			0
@entity4 judge mr @entity76 said he felt ‘ an abiding sense of disbelief that a parent could behave in such a wicked and selfish way towards a vulnerable child ’			1
the court heard the @entity185 - born mother , who can not be named to protect the identities of her three adopted children and her grandson – the child born to her daughter , chose to be sterilised in 2001 so she did not pass her diabetes on to any children			1
the case was heard in the @entity4 but reporting restrictions prevent the naming of the family , the local authority and the area they lived in instead , she adopted three daughters as babies from foreign orphanages and foster homes , two while married to an @entity204 man and a third as a single parent , and raised them in @entity206			1
she was banned from adopting more children but longed for another child , and forced her eldest daughter to conceive			1
she told the girl about her plans when her daughter was only 13 , and the two - year insemination ‘ programme ’ began when the teenager – identified in legal documents only as a – was 14			1
the judge said : ‘ a did not want to take part in the programme , but she allowed her body to be used by her mother because she loves her			0
‘ a ’s participation in the programme caused her continuous anxiety			0
the physical steps that the mother asked her to take were degrading , humiliating and , on occasions , painful			0
’ the mother bought frozen sperm over the internet and prepared syringes full of it for her daughter to use to inseminate herself			1
she was desperate that any resulting baby should be a girl , and forced her daughter to follow a special diet of dairy and alkaline foods in the belief this would affect the gender of the child			1
in july 2010 , the mother wrote an ‘ affirmation ’ on her computer , setting out her wishes for the future – a lottery win and a healthy baby girl , who she wanted to call @entity245			1
she wrote : ‘ i desire to win the thunderball jackpot of £ 500,000 and for a to conceive and carry @entity245 to term for birth in april			0
’ in october that year , @entity49 became pregnant and she gave birth to a son in june 2011 , after a difficult labour which left her needing surgery			0
nurses knew she planned to give her baby to her mother to raise , but were worried by her mother ’s aggressive behaviour , including a refusal to let a breastfeed her baby , saying : ‘ we do n’t want any of that attachment thing			2
’ midwives raised the alarm when the mother tried to take the newborn baby from the ward , and @entity49 later confided in a family friend about her ordeal			1
all four children were taken into care and the mother was charged with child cruelty			1
she initially denied the allegations , accusing her daughter of being a fantasist , and told authorities the girl was mentally ill. she later pleaded guilty to five charges of child cruelty			1
the @entity4 heard she had raised her three adopted daughters in a ‘ toxic cocoon ’ , teaching them at home so they would not go to school and isolating them from friends or neighbours			0
when she was 15 , @entity49 was left alone to look after her youngest sister , then only four or five , while her mother and the middle sister went to the @entity185 for a ten - day holiday			0
@entity49 told the court she had seen her mother smack her youngest sister regularly , and said she had tied the little girl to a chair when she would not sit still and had stuck duct tape over her mouth for answering back			1
the court also heard disturbing details about failed attempts to alert social services to the family ’s set - up			1
@entity92 described the mother ’s terrace home as like a ‘ fortress ’ , with the curtains always closed and no one allowed inside			0
in 2006 , a gp neighbour contacted social services , saying she could hear the mother shouting and swearing at her youngest child , who was then two , and said the toddler was left crying for up to two hours at a time			2
social workers investigated and saw all three children and the mother , but decided there was no cause for concern			1
in january 2007 , an anonymous letter was sent to social services and other authorities			0
a social worker ’s report warned that the mother ‘ appears to be doing things secretively for her own gain ’ , but concluded there was no evidence of ‘ significant harm ’ to the children , and the case was closed again			1
in 2008 , the @entity331 made another referral to social services			0
a third investigation was launched but the case was closed after social workers spoke to the mother on the telephone , without seeing the children or visiting the house			1
mr @entity76 said : ‘ between 2006 and 2008 , the mother succeeded in keeping social services at arm ’s length so that their investigations were essentially superficial			2
‘ concerns were seen off by a parent who was recognised to be domineering			0
the children were never heard			0
’ the local authority can not be named for legal reasons but its @entity349 has launched a serious case review , due to be published next month			0
the @entity349 said : ‘ nothing can change what has happened to the children in this truly terrible case			0
‘ it is clear that public bodies must highlight the major public policy issues which arise from this case			0
