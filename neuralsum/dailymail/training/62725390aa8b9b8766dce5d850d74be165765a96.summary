@entity2 defender @entity1 wrestling striker @entity0 to the floor was a stonewall penalty and referee @entity5 should be congratulated on having the courage to give it			1
too often these days defenders get away with this sort of grappling , particularly at corners and free kicks			0
he booked @entity1 as well and it â€™s good to see a referee acting firmly in an attempt to put a stop to this type of desperate defending			0
@entity0 was wrestled to the floor by @entity1 in the penalty area @entity5 is surrounded by @entity2 players after awarding a controversial penalty against @entity1 @entity21 won a penalty for @entity2 after a challenge from @entity25 defender @entity24 however , @entity5 suffered a momentary lapse and got it completely wrong later in the first half when he awarded a penalty for what was clearly a dive by @entity2 forward @entity21			1
although @entity25 defender @entity24 was running alongside @entity21 as he ran into the area there was little or no contact			2
in cases like this it should be possible for retrospective action to be taken against @entity21 for blatant simulation			2
video it was a penalty - @entity42			0

@entity25 were awarded a penalty when @entity1 *pulled* @entity0 to the *ground*
@entity5 was *brave* to award the penalty for @entity25
@entity21 won a penalty for @entity2 when *fouled* by @entity24
there was little or no contact and @entity21 should face retrospective action
