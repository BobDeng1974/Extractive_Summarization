by @entity0 carefully manoeuvring the pushchair through the doors of my local bank , i return the friendly smiles from customers			1
as usual , @entity7 and i are treated like royalty , with bank staff fussing over her in the stroller and remarking how pretty and placid she is			1
every mother knows just how precious the ‘ buggy years ’ are			0
when my son @entity13 outgrew his eight years ago ( he ’s 11 now ) , i missed it enormously			0
there are other plus points , too			0
i would load the pram with shopping bags , strategically park it in cafes to make sure i had plenty of room , relishing that ‘ out of the way ! mum coming through ! ’ power that only a baby - carriage allows			1
it ’s fair to say that as a single mum just months away from my 41st birthday , i did n’t think i ’d once again be pounding the pavements surrounding my @entity43 home with a trendy , jogger - style three - wheel buggy			2
but i am , and i ’m loving it because it makes me feel like a young mum again			0
however , the attention i attract with @entity7 is very different to what i experienced when @entity13 was a golden - haired little boy			1
and why ? because @entity7 is a four - year - old @entity50 , and we are using a pet pushchair			1
the reaction from passers - by as we walk around town varies greatly			1
i ’ve been laughed at , asked if she is ill , told i ’m cruel , and even accused of being an attention - seeker			2
in fact , i was inspired by a sweet old lady i met in @entity60 a few months ago			0
hitting the town : @entity0 is pictured above hitting the shops with @entity7 and pram - she is pictured left outside @entity64 's and right near a @entity66 branch aged 90 if she was a day , she was pushing three elderly pekingese dogs ( all in various states of decline ) down a wooded path			1
she told me the stroller had transformed all their lives and that she would n’t be without it			2
‘ and it makes me feel just like i ’m wheeling a baby around , ’ she confided in hushed tones			0
i was immediately sold on the idea			0
when @entity7 was a puppy , i ’d experimented with dog carry bags and had taken her out in a holdall - like contraption over my shoulder			1
but she did n’t like it - and neither did i. it was heavy and , to my mind , hot and stifling for her			2
a pushchair would be more comfortable ; it would let her see the world yet still give me control over where she goes			0
@entity91 , the company i got my cream - coloured model from , tell me the 90 strollers they have sold in the past year have gone mainly to owners who have elderly dogs , or pets with mobility problems			2
they are also popular for people with puppies , as young dogs get tired walking longer distances			2
having a browse : the pair pause for a while to look at a shoe display , with @entity7 sat calmly in her pram there are dozens of different types on the market in an array of colours , starting from about £ 40 and rising to £ 260 for a top - of - the - range model			1
some of the more expensive ones have cupholders so the owner can enjoy a coffee , and there ’s a built - in tray for treats			2
other features include mesh panels to aid ventilation and stop insects flying in , clip - on straps so your dog ca n’t fall or jump out , hoods with clear plastic windows so your dog can watch the world go by but stay dry when it rains , sun canopies for hot , cloudless days and large , air - filled wheels ideal for bumpy terrains			2
most are suitable for medium - sized dogs such as a beagle or @entity136 , but you can get one big enough for a labrador			2
@entity7 is not immobile in any way , as her energetic dashes around the local park show			1
but in many ways she is my baby , so it makes sense to place her in a pushchair			0
after all , she is absolutely one of the family , and i dote on her as much as i do my son			0
in fact , ‘ @entity152 ’ is one of my pet names for her			0
the pushchair , which cost £ 139 , also allows us to spend time together we would n’t otherwise have			1
just last week , i took @entity7 to @entity155 for a four - day break			1
out and about : according to @entity0 , the stroller lets her take @entity7 further afield without piling on the stress usually she ’d go to our fabulous dog - minder , but she was away so i had no choice but to take @entity7 along , too			1
in the past , taking @entity7 has been stressful for all concerned			1
when visiting attractions , it always means one person has to wait outside on dog duty			0
despite being a nation of dog lovers , we are pretty intolerant when it comes to allowing our four - legged friends into shops and restaurants			0
now , thanks to @entity7 ’s pram , establishments with dog bans are n’t as much of a problem			1
tucked up in her buggy with the hood down and a plentiful supply of biscuits to keep her sweet , no one was any the wiser when i popped in with @entity7 in tow			1
and those who did spot she is a dog and not a toddler were generally so taken aback and intrigued that they were happy to let us stay			0
stowed away : the pushchair can be carried around in the back of her car happy to pose : @entity7 enjoys simply being wheeled along and watching the world go by critics say @entity7 should be running freely in the park on her own four legs , and not cooped up in a pram			1
of course she still enjoys those pleasures — but she also clearly enjoys being wheeled along and watching the world go by			0
i also feel that with my buggy i am being extremely responsible when i take her out - which is not the case with many other owners			0
i have lost count of the number of times out - of - control animals have jumped up at my son , and we routinely see dogs tied up outside shops or tethered to tables in pubs , all barking , yapping and generally getting very distressed - and being an absolute nuisance to everyone around them			0
even more worryingly , i have witnessed disturbing numbers of pets being left in boiling hot cars by irresponsible owners			0
so i feel i am beyond criticism for keeping my dog with me			0
safe in her stroller , @entity7 is secure and can not cause a nuisance to anyone else - while i bask in the mostly positive attention it attracts			1
@entity7 , too , delights in being taken out in her stroller			1
in fact she leaps with excitement the moment she sees it being unfolded			0
call me barking mad , but i ’m revelling in this second chance at motherhood .			2

@entity0 , 41 , loves hitting the town and strolling with pet @entity7
the @entity50 , aged four , is pushed around in a pram
using her £ 139 stroller @entity0 can take @entity7 on long *journeys* stress - free
pushing her around is also ' a second chance at motherhood ' for @entity0
says some people criticise her - but she and @entity247 love using the pram
