' she was lying down in the field about 20ft from the house ( when she was found )			0
she says she did n’t know how she came to be in the that position but she came round when she heard voices			0
' but recorder of bradford judge @entity104 said @entity7 had done everything ' to keep herself out of the way and avoid detection '			2
he added : ' the only sensible reason is she was trying to lie low and avoid the situation '			0
the judge told her : ' you must have been significantly over the prescribed limit for driving			0
' you failed to negotiate a fairly moderate bend in the road , going straight on a hitting a wall			0
it must have been apparent to you he was very badly injured			0
' the court heard the @entity122 and the @entity123 were friends , and mr @entity9 ’s family had supported @entity7 after the accident			1
traffic constable @entity126 , of @entity128 ’s @entity127 , said : ' @entity7 showed a callous disregard for mr @entity9 ’s welfare when she left the scene of the collision			1
isolated : police said the crash was in a country lane ( pictured ) between the villages of @entity137 and @entity39 businessman : police said hotelier mr @entity9 was a popular member of the community and his family was on good terms with @entity7 's			1
his relatives remained supportive towards her after the accident , the court heard ' the sentence reflects the gravity of the offences she committed and how seriously all agencies in the criminal justice system view them			0
' @entity153 , deputy chief crown prosecutor for @entity14 and @entity154 , added : ' by getting behind the wheel of her vehicle after she had been drinking she took a huge and irresponsible risk and , very sadly , mr @entity9 paid for it with his life			1
' she then neglected to alert emergency services as soon as practicable and it was several hours after the accident before any potential help arrived			0
' @entity164 was very well - known and much - loved in the local community			0
he was a father , a son and a friend to many and will be sorely missed			0
' this terrible case has resulted in the loss of his life and devastated that of many others			0
i hope it serves as a stark warning of the potentially tragic consequences of drinking and driving			0
