the @entity0 on tuesday passed a religious freedom bill similar to one recently approved in @entity2 , landing the contentious issue on @entity5 governor @entity5 's desk			1
@entity5 has said he 'll sign the measure , even though he 's facing protests from activists who say it could open the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians			1
like @entity2 's new law , the @entity0 measure aims to keep the state government from forcing business owners to act against their religious beliefs , but critics say it will be a ' license to discriminate ' by refusing service to gays and lesbians			1
concerns about wedding vendors who have religious objections to playing a part in same - sex ceremonies have driven most of the controversy			1

' surrender : @entity2 gov. @entity50 walked back his state 's new religious freedom law on tuesday , saying he would work with lawmakers to ' fix ' it @entity40 , an attorney in private practice , sponsored the bill			2
he said the legislation ' focuses on the civil rights of people believing what they want to believe , and not letting the government interfere with that			0
' but he said he agrees with @entity2 gov. @entity50 , who has been fighting a tide of resentment after he signed a similar bill into law , that ' there needs to be some clarity in the perception of the legislation			0
' ' as it sits right now , ' he told the @entity46 , his bill is ' not going to enable a person to discriminate			0
' final approval came when the @entity0 overwhelmingly concurred with three amendments added by the @entity76 , which approved the bill last week			2

the outcry over the @entity2 law was so fierce that the state 's governor , @entity41 @entity50 , on tuesday said he would ' fix ' the legislation to make it clear businesses can not use it to discriminate against same - sex couples			1
earlier in march , a @entity76 - approved religious freedom bill in @entity128 was put on hold after a @entity0 member added anti-discrimination language			1
on monday , @entity133 's governor said he would not sign similar language into law because it would allow government officials to refuse to perform marriages on religious grounds			0
if enacted , the @entity88 proposal would prohibit state and local governments from infringing on a person 's religious beliefs without a ' compelling ' reason			2
but unlike in @entity2 , @entity88 lawmakers said they will not modify their measure			2
