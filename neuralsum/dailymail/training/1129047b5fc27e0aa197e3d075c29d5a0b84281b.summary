by @entity0 this is the shocking moment a tombstoner hurled himself off a historic @entity5 bridge - plunging more than 60ft into the water below			1
the young man was caught on camera leaping from @entity9 , which was built by @entity5 and spans the @entity10 between @entity11 and @entity12 , @entity13			1
donning black swimming shorts , he scaled scaffolding surrounding the crossing , before jumping the height of two houses into the cold water			1
the tombstoner is just one of many youngsters who locals claim are ' risking their lives ' by throwing themselves off the famous bridge			1
now they have found a way of getting onto the scaffolding that is surrounding the pillar of the @entity5 railway bridge			1
' they are using it as a diving board for their tombstoning			2
the height they are jumping from is crazy , and i guess it 's only a matter of time before someone gets hurt			2
' it comes as emergency services , mps and city councillors have issued warnings to young people about tombstoning over the summer months			1
the craze involves jumping from cliffs , piers and other structures , before entering the water below in an upright position ' like a tombstone '			1
yesterday , @entity69 , @entity71 mp and former lifeguard , urged parents the region to help clampdown on tombstoning			2
she said young people are seen jumping from rocks and structures on @entity79 - often into shallow water - every year , and some have even been left paralysed by tombstoning			1
massive leap : donning black swimming shorts , the tombstoner scaled scaffolding surrounding the crossing , before jumping the height of two houses into the cold water she added that tombstoners are not only risking their own safety but the lives of others as their exploits draw emergency services from other areas			1
' we need to put an end to this tombstoning practice in @entity11 , ' said ms @entity69			2
' it 's simply not safe			0
all we can do really is keep raising awareness of the problem			0
' if you are a parent or a carer i would encourage you to talk to your sons and daughters and remind them of how dangerous tombstoning is			2
' there are some beautiful areas of @entity11 's shoreline to visit and enjoy , you do n't have to risk your life			0
' ms @entity69 said she believes tombstoners do not know how dangerous their actions are , saying : ' it always staggers me that intelligent young people will throw themselves off a wall on the @entity79 into the water			1
famous : @entity9 , opened by @entity122 on may 2 , 1859 , spans the @entity10 between @entity11 on the @entity124 bank and @entity12 on the @entity13 bank ' they often do not know exactly how deep it is and , with the changing tides , they do not know how dangerous their actions are			1
we have had very serious accidents where people have been left crippled or paralysed and yet year after year it happens again			2
' as a former lifeguard i can tell you there is seriously nothing more terrifying than seeing jumping into the water and not immediately reappearing			1
' @entity9 , which was opened by @entity122 on may 2 , 1859 , comprises two 455 - feet iron trusses , situated 100 feet above the water , giving it a total length of 2,187 feet			1
its creator , @entity143 , was an @entity145 mechanical and civil engineer whose designs revolutionised public transport and modern engineering			0
a spokesman for @entity124 and @entity150 , today described tombstoning , which is not illegal , as a ' potentially lethal pursuit '			2
' the summer holidays and warmer weather can attract tombstoners into @entity11 , ' he said			0
' tombstoning is a reckless activity and even in calmer waters it can be extremely dangerous			0
' we , along with the @entity160 , are trying to deter young people from this potentially lethal pursuit and we strongly advise against it			1
' it may seem like fun but people are gambling with their lives against the power of the sea by jumping into unknown waters			1
' it is unfortunately the case that if they carry on they are likely to end up with serious , life - changing injury or even death			0
this risk - taking behaviour is just not worth it			0
' a spokesman for @entity160 said the issue of tombstoning is a recurring problem for @entity11			0
' over the last few weeks we have had reports of tombstoning in @entity11 and we do look into each case , ' she said			0
' when these reports come in we inform the coastguard patrol boat , or the police patrol boat in the area , to have a word in the ear of tombstoners offering safety advice			0
it 's a problem we have every year			0
it 's something the kids will do but they are advised not to because of the dangers			0
' there have been cases over the years of kids getting seriously hurt			0
this is something of course that we want to avoid			0
@entity204 has been linked with numerous deaths in @entity206 in recent years .			0
