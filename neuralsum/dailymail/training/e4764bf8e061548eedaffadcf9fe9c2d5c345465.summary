by @entity1 reporter published : 05:53 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 08:22 est , 6 august 2013 he was famous for singing about living in a ' yellow submarine '			0
but in fact , for a period at least , the infamous founder of the @entity5 lived in a yellow gypsy caravan			2
@entity9 's eccentric caravan , which he had painted with a psychedelic design , was home to him and his family on holidays in the 1960s			1
but after his assassination the caravan was acquired by fellow @entity17 and never seen again			1
serendipity : @entity19 , pictured , has been given sole responsibility of restoring the remains of @entity9 's gypsy caravan , for charitable causes decorative : the gipsy caravan would have stood out of the crowd with its bright and colourful design now , however , the yellow travelling carriage has been discovered - still in the same place it was left			1
@entity17 kept the carriage next to his swimming pool at his former home , in @entity34 , @entity35			1
when he sold his house , however , he left the caravan where is it was			0
the house went on to be let out to tenants , complete with the rotting carriage beside the pool , but sadly hidden from the rest of the world			0
unlike @entity9 's psychedelic - painted @entity46 , which went on to be restored and sits in pride of place in a museum in @entity50 , this vehicle had been left to rust and fade			1
but all is not lost , since the job of restoring and selling the caravan has fallen to @entity19 , from @entity54 , @entity35 - a local charitable figure who plans to raise funds from the find			2
signed : @entity59 , who specialises in restoring vintage gipsy wagons , placed his signature in in the middle of the rose design following restoration commissioned by @entity65 in the 1980s @entity66 : the colourful design was commissioned by @entity9 in a style similar to the psychedelic @entity66 style of the @entity5 @entity70 , of @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity35 , said : ' the property had previously been owned by @entity65 and the caravan was not removed when he sold the house			1
' my landlord was aware that the caravan had been owned by the @entity5 and had always had in mind to offer it to a charity to see if they were interested in renovating it for fundraising purposes			0
' as it was in very dilapidated condition there was quite a lot of work to be done and he had never got round to doing himself , but he knew that it could be potentially of some financial value if a suitable craftsman could do the rebuilding work required			0
some of the paint work is in great condition , while other parts will take a lot of work to restore restoration : while the gipsy caravan has been restored once before , it is clearly in need of further work to bring it back to its former glory ' when the house was sold last year , our landlord asked us to find a suitable home for the caravan and asked me if i knew of any charities that would be interested			0
' so mr @entity70 got in touch with fundraiser mr @entity19 , who received the unexpected call while on an epic @entity117 to @entity119 charity walk for prostate cancer			0
mr @entity19 said : ' it was one of those " could you repeat " moments			0
i simply could not believe what i was being told			0
' mr @entity19 has now been made the charitable guardian of the remaining sections of the caravan and has been authorised to help the charities of his choice with any money made through the potential sale			0
the ' @entity132 ' once set off on its own ' @entity133 ' - heading to the tiny private island of @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity137 eventually the caravan made its way back to @entity54 and stood in the garden of @entity141 until @entity9 's assassination in @entity50 in1980 he said : ' this caravan is a piece of @entity146 history and represents the spirit of its time			1
' ideally i would like to see it take pride of place in a cultural museum in @entity153 , the @entity5 birthplace , where experts can decide if it should be returned to its original @entity66 glory , but for charities ' sake i will have to balance any interest very carefully			0
' the glamorous vehicle was bought by @entity9 in 1967 for his then four - year - old son @entity161 's birthday			1
the ' @entity17 's @entity132 ' , as it was called at the time , was styled with @entity66 psychedelic artwork , which @entity9 also famously adorned his @entity46 with			1
former glory : @entity9 's gypsy caravan , pictured arriving at his home in @entity169 , @entity35 after it was painted , has been found rotting in the former back garden of @entity17 @entity9 , pictured with @entity171 and children @entity172 and @entity174			1
@entity9 bought the caravan for @entity161 for his fourth birthday originally called a @entity179 or @entity180 caravan , it was repainted at a garage in @entity182 to @entity9 's specific designs and was transported on the 24th of july 1967 to @entity141 in @entity54 where @entity9 lived with first wife @entity184 and son @entity161			1
@entity9 pictured with his son @entity161 on another of their holidays , this time at @entity190 preparing to leave for @entity191 this caused much interest in the area with one local resident - a mrs @entity196 - quoted as calling the caravan ' an absolute hideosity '			1
however , the teenage fans who gathered at the gates of @entity9 's estate were much more enthusiastic and mrs @entity203 's threat to report the offending vehicle to the residents association was met with boos and jeers			2
the last leg of its journey involved rafting the caravan across @entity212 onto the island hideaway where @entity9 and his family could enjoy it in peace			0
eventually the caravan made its way back to @entity54 and stood in the garden of @entity141 until @entity9 's assassination in @entity50 in1980			1
fellow @entity221 then acquired it as part of the late @entity17 's estate and discovered that the whole caravan was in a poor state of repair			2
so he called in vintage caravan restorer @entity59 and commissioned him to make urgent repairs			0
this took nearly a year but by september 1983 that caravan had been returned to its full glory and its last known location was next to @entity17 's swimming pool			2
but while @entity9 's famous @entity46 is now prominently displayed in a museum in @entity236 , the mythical ' @entity132 ' remained ' lost '			2
or so they thought .			0

@entity9 bought the gypsy caravan for his son @entity161 's fourth birthday , in 1967
@entity17 acquired it after @entity9 's assassination , but left it in the garden of his former @entity35 home
now *rediscovered* , there are plans to restore it to its former glory
