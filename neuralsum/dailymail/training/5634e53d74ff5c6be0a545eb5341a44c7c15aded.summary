she wanted to incorporate her rifle and her trophy from her favorite hunt the photographer 's caption , provided with the image , read : ' @entity31 of @entity32 has a strong interest and a healthy respect for guns			2
@entity31 's senior pictures were a reflection of all his interests ' students , for example , can not be pointing the gun at the camera in a photograph , in a way which would seem threatening			0
there are no restrictions on what types of guns the students are allowed to pose with , according to the newly - adopted policy - but their outfit must adhere to a strict school dress code			1
guns are still banned from @entity55 school grounds so the yearbook pictures must either be taken by parents or by a professional photographer			2

the school allows students to pose with other props related to their hobbies such as sporting equipment and musical instruments			2
there are bans on clothes which do not apply with school dress code which is deemed as clothes ' disruptive to the education program '			0
drugs , alcohol and tobacco are , perhaps as expected , strictly banned			0
mr @entity15 said : ' shooting sports are very popular in the area and we have a number of national champion shooters at the school but we did n't have a policy in place , so we decided to outline it			1

he said : ' we certainly understand that this is a sensitive topic for many folks			0
we know that there are many people with very strong opinions on both sides			0
' we looked at our community and established a policy that suited our community and decided to allow the pictures , as long as they are not done in a manner that would depict violence towards humanity			2
he added : ' we certainly understand that it will have its critics			0
