' his employment commenced on the 4 march 2014 , but there were immediately problems during his probation period with accounting errors and processing errors which resulted in him being spoken to by supervisors , ' mr @entity41 said			0
' to elicit sympathy from his employers the defendant lied about illness and death of a child in his family and because of that he was given a little bit of latitude and time off			0
' however , the story was a sham and there had been no death or illness in his family			0
' as his performance was not good he parted company , it seems amicably , with @entity5 on may 7 but shortly afterwards the owners of the company decided they would do an audit and in particular they were concerned about three unrecognised transfers , ' said mr @entity41			2

' the two payments were made without the consent or authority of the accountants signing off at @entity5 , the recipients of the funds were not related to the business and suspicion fell on mr @entity3 as he had actioned all the transfers			1

' the judge added it took @entity3 only six weeks to set up the ' apparatus to defraud '			2
' apart from the seriousness of the deceit of your employers and the very considerable breach of trust as far as they are concerned , to commit this crime you had to trick , and did trick , with elaborate lies two friends of yours , ' said judge @entity201			0
