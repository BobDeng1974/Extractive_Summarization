she said the couple had discussed plans for her to travel to @entity48 to stay with him but they had not yet arranged a date			2
this new relationship is understood to have caused a rift between the woman and @entity35 , who is said to have been unhappy that @entity3 had formed a new relationship so quickly			1
describing his personality , the woman said @entity3 was ' very strict ' with other women but said it was merely a symptom of his perfectionism and his desire to ' do the right thing '			1

' the fiancee was forced to fly back to @entity96 because @entity3 was so heartbroken , the source told the @entity100			2

' horrific death : officers arrived at @entity3 's blood - spattered 31st - floor apartment to find @entity115 still alive despite gaping knife wounds to her throat and buttocks , but she died soon after victim : one of the two women discovered inside @entity3 's luxury apartment in @entity48			1
the woman , named locally as @entity115 , was 30 years old and originally from the @entity12 butchered : sex workers named locally as @entity126 ( left ) and @entity115 ( right ) were found dead at @entity3 's blood - spattered 31st - floor apartment in @entity48 after the investment banker called police @entity3 , a former pupil at the £ 34,000 - a - year @entity131 , was often ' pre-occupied with power and money ' and liked going out and buying tables at clubs , the friend added			1
it also emerged that @entity3 branded himself an ' insane psychopath ' in a chilling ' out - of - office ' e-mail from his @entity33 account days before the bodies were found at his flat			1
the e-mail response read : ' i am out of the office			0
for urgent enquiries , or indeed any enquiries , please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath			0
' for escalation please contact @entity151 , though suspect the devil will have custody [ last line only really worked if i had followed through ]			0
' the message would appear to suggest he had meant to kill himself			0
hanging out : after police were called to his apartment , @entity3 was questioned before being driven away for further questioning , leaving a forensic team to examine the scene at his flat surrounded : @entity3 sits with a group of women			1
he reportedly called police at 3am on @entity166 night ' insane psychopath ' : @entity3 has been charged with the murder of two prostitutes found butchered at his @entity48 flat			1
he is pictured here with @entity35 , also known as @entity172 , who is believed to be the trader 's ex-girlfriend , but not the @entity15 trader to whom he was engaged , nor the woman who spoke to @entity10 out with the girls : @entity3 , who moved to @entity48 from @entity96 in july last year , quit his high - earning job in the city , where expat bankers lead notoriously hedonistic lifestyles in another disturbing development , police in the former @entity15 colony were urgently investigating whether there were any more victims after photos of one of the dead women were allegedly among 2,000 pictures and videos on a smartphone used by @entity43			1
the @entity195 - style killing spree came to an end on @entity166 night when @entity3 , from @entity197 , reportedly rang police shortly after 3am			1
officers arrived at his blood - spattered 31st - floor apartment to find a 30 - year - old @entity201 prostitute , named locally as @entity115 , still alive despite gaping knife wounds to her throat and buttocks			2
eight hours later , during a forensic examination of the flat , police officers spotted a suitcase on the balcony which had two feet protruding			0
@entity210 was the decomposing naked body of the second prostitute , 25 - year - old @entity201 @entity126			2
@entity213 – where @entity3 is thought to have picked up £ 200 - a - night prostitutes – is @entity48 's notorious red light district			1
just two blocks away from his apartment , hundreds of bars and clubs are teeming with mainly south - east @entity221 sex workers , who offer ' lady drinks ' to potential customers before discreetly negotiating prices for sex			0
the area was made infamous by the 1960 film @entity227 , about a @entity229 prostitute			0
t is understood the two women allegedly murdered by @entity3 had travelled from their homes in @entity201 to seek a better life - and earn enough money to send back to their families , it is understood			1
@entity237 , the 25 - year - old whose decomposing body was found on the balcony of the apartment which @entity3 was renting , had travelled to the former @entity15 colony only a month ago from her home in the central @entity244 of @entity245			1
prostitution is legal in @entity48 , but many women working as ' freelancers ' are doing so illegally as they are there on tourist visas – including miss @entity126			1
the second woman , aged 30 , who has been living in @entity48 for up to eight years , was known as @entity115			1
officials who take responsibility for foreigners in the colony said that was not her real name			0
@entity10 understands that her real name is @entity258 and that she comes from the large @entity201 island of @entity260 , joining the many thousands of young @entity201 women who set out into the ‘ outside world ’ to take up a variety of jobs , many of them in the domestic service industry			0
' @entity115 ' has told friends that she had earned enough money in her years in @entity48 to be able to have a house built for herself and her family in @entity201			2
according to a spokesman for @entity201 ’s @entity273 had approached a private ‘ placement company ’ in @entity274 , which found her a job in @entity48 , although it was not immediately known what that work was			2
officials from several welfare and workers ’ organisations said last night that they were still trying to trace family members of both women who might not be aware of the grisley murders			0
referring to the 25 - year - old , a spokesman for the @entity289 and @entity290 , said : ' we are trying to trace the address of @entity294 , ’ @entity295 , a south coast port town lying nearly 200 miles south east of @entity297 , has a population of more than a million and competition for work is said to be intense			0
it was cut off from air travel when the airport closed several years ago and travellers are now faced with a tedious journey along roads jammed with motor scooters			0
tourists are put off from visiting because the town ’s most well known beaches have become fouled from leakage from shipping vessels that dock nearby			0
despite the authorities ' efforts to clean up the area , it is filled with hotel rooms that can be rented by the hour			0
one user wrote on the internet : ' the more expensive ones almost seem like normal business hotels – the cheaper ones are like mental hospitals			0
' robberies and money - laundering are also rife and @entity229 gangsters are said to run many of the bars .			0
