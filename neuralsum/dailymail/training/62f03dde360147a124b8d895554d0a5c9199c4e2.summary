while @entity2 was watching the midterm election results come in , commentators on @entity1 were doing a terrible job pretending to be big fans of the @entity6 3			1
@entity6 gave commentators on the network tablets to use throughout the night , but some of the reporters were seen blatantly typing away on their @entity11 products half concealed by their provided @entity13 gadget			1
according to a source who was at the @entity1 studios for yesterday 's coverage , the whole team was n't exactly excited at the prospect of having to use @entity6 devices			1
@entity20 is a @entity11 : @entity1 's chief @entity22 correspondent was seen typing away on his @entity24 during election night coverage , behind a @entity6 - provided @entity6 3 can you spot the @entity24 ? political contributor @entity27 used a @entity6 to indiscreetly hold up her @entity24 during tuesday night 's election coverage ' there 's going to be no personal digital devices allowed on set today or tonight , ' a @entity1 producer told guests and their handlers gathered in the network 's @entity22 ' green room ' during a 5:00 p.m. broadcast			1
apparently that rule was n't followed by everyone			2
camera angles exposed @entity1 's chief @entity22 correspondent @entity20 as a @entity11 user , indiscreetly typing on his ipad from behind his free @entity6 , while political contributor @entity27 used her tablet as a stand for her @entity48 device			1
' they 're just not allowing anybody to bring their own			0
' the producer said she herself was an @entity48 devotee			0
' i had @entity11 for ages and then had to switch to pcs , ' she explained			0
' now i â€™m back to @entity24 and @entity11 again , and i just love it			2
' a press flack for former @entity60 @entity59 piped up from a chair			0
' @entity63 's not gon na like this , ' he said			0
' it 's gon na take his email forever to load on that thing			0
this ought to be interesting			0
' as @entity70 walked down a hallway toward @entity1 's broadcast studio , he was seen fiddling with an @entity73			2
a representative for @entity1 said that the @entity6 tablets used on election night coverage were ' not a product placement deal ' and that reporters were not barred from bringing their own devices			1
' surface tablets were provided at each seat to give guests , contributors , and @entity1 talent real - time election results through " @entity86 " - an application optimized for internet explorer			1
' while panelists rotated throughout the night , the tablets remained in place			2
talent brought with them to the studio their own personal devices for email and social media , ' the spokesman said			0
when @entity6 first launched their tablet , they ran a series of ads showing all of the things the @entity6 could do ( like stand up with a kickstand ) that an @entity24 could n't			1
but it appears they are now focusing their efforts on attacking @entity48 's sales of the @entity107 - their slimmest and lightest laptop , with a new commercial advertising campaign			0
this latest failure to market @entity6 's tablet comes after the company struck a $ 400million deal to supply the @entity114 with their tablets .			2

@entity6 provided their @entity6 3 tablets to @entity1 to use during election night coverage
but the commentators were not so good at concealing their @entity24 which they used behind the *competitor* tablets
