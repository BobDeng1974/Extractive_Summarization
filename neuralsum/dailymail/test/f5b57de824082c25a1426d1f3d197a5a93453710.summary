@entity0 sure knows how to finish			2
and , in passing , how to make a point			0
left on the bench for wednesday night ’s home clash with @entity7 , perhaps uncertain over his place in the starting @entity9 for sunday ’s @entity10 semi-final against @entity12 , the @entity4 striker scored a 19 - minute hat - trick to guide his team to a handsome 4 - 1 victory			1
the treble - chasing reigning champions came from a goal down , inspired by @entity18 and the second - half introduction of @entity0 , to record a win that takes them eight points clear at the top of the @entity24 – and lifts confidence ahead of their trip to @entity28			1
hat - trick hero @entity0 with signed match ball and man of the match award @entity32 ’s wickedly deflected strike early in the second half had given the visitors a shock lead completely against the run of play – only for @entity18 to equalise in spectacular , if contested , fashion eight minutes later			1
as good and important as commons was for @entity4 , though , even his performance was overshadowed by the arrival of @entity0 , who simply exploded on to the scene with three goals of supreme quality in less time than it takes for the average warm down			1
rightly named @entity50 despite playing for just over half an hour , the former @entity49 front man eased all the frets and fears of home fans on a night that had looked to be slipping away from their team			0
@entity4 's @entity0 ( right ) completes his hat - trick against @entity7 @entity4 had begun the night with a starting xi looking very much like the team @entity59 might have been thinking about for @entity28 , all things being equal ; leaving @entity61 and @entity62 , both suspended for the semi-final , on the bench suggested that he was giving his @entity10 formation a gentle run out			1
against a @entity7 team whose ambition rarely threatened to over-reach their ability , there were certainly passages of play that resembled nothing so uncompetitive as a training session			2
with @entity80 plodding along on his lonesome up front and only the pace of left winger @entity83 carrying even the hint of a threat to the home side , the visitors – doughty in defence but reliably clumsy on the ball – were obviously intent on playing a containing game			1
@entity0 collects the match ball after his second - half hat trick on wednesday night maybe , just maybe , they ’d catch @entity4 sleeping and grab a surprise goal			1
and , if not , well , a nil - nil at @entity93 is never a disgrace , right ? the problem for those who turned up in anticipation of a football match was that , however well @entity4 played , attack against defence boasts only so much in the way of entertainment value			2
@entity103 looked the most obvious outlet for a @entity4 breakthrough , the winger scampering down the left and finding space where none should have existed , though too often making the wrong call			2
the former @entity112 regular might have scored himself with seven minutes on the clock , tearing into the box and receiving an @entity115 pass at pace , yet @entity103 ’s first touch was half an ounce heavy – allowing young @entity7 captain @entity119 to make a vital block on his shot			2
substitute @entity0 came off the bench to spark @entity4 into life after lacklustre first - half it did n’t take overly long for the crowd , such as it was on a night when empty seats abounded , to grow frustrated by the home team ’s inability to get themselves ahead			1
@entity134 loping forward from central defence caused a few stirs of excitement , @entity132 ’s running beyond lone striker @entity133 promised at least a possibility or two			0
still space in the final third remained at a premium			0
home skipper @entity142 should have done a great deal better with an @entity115 cut - back on the half - hour mark , failing to connect cleanly with the bouncing ball and watching it balloon high and wide of the target			0
would set - pieces , of which there were an increasing number , provide a more productive avenue of attack for @entity4 ? well , big @entity155 came fairly close with a flashing header from a @entity18 corner			1
in open play , an inability – or unwillingness – to let fly continued to be the running theme , one great guddle involving @entity133 and @entity103 , neither finding that half yard needed to take a shot inside the box , moving the locals to howls of annoyance			0
if they were irked by their heroes showing less than perfect concentration in the art of opening up their opposition , @entity7 ’s opener had the home support in uproar when they took a hugely unexpected lead four minutes into the second half			1
@entity4 manager @entity59 ( left ) congratulates @entity0 after the final whistle two or three @entity4 players had a chance to close down and dispossess @entity83 as he made ground and tied defenders in on the flank , yet he kept hold of the ball long enough for support to arrive in the shape of @entity192			1
sure , the midfielder ’s shot took the kind of deflection for which there is no accounting , smacking @entity199 and spinning beyond a helpless @entity200			0
but failure to apply due diligence at the back definitely contributed to the concession			0
their fans roused and their own pride hurt , @entity4 had to muster a quick response			0
step forward the captain , who pounced to nick the ball off the toe of @entity212 – prompting immediately complaints of a dangerous challenge			0
@entity0 was thrown into the fray before the game could be restarted , @entity103 making way as @entity4 tried to provide @entity133 with more support up front			1
as substitutions go , not one of @entity59 ’s worst			0
@entity0 had been on the park all of six minutes , in fact , when he put @entity4 ahead , rising to score with a downward header after @entity18 had shown excellent skill and vision to drive towards the byeline , beat his man and dig out a cross to the back post			1
as soon as they went ahead , the shackles seemed to fall from the limbs of the home players			0
suddenly , they were finding space , making killer passes , creating openings and – most importantly – taking shots			0
none better than the 25 - yarder that @entity0 sent screaming past @entity242 with 10 minutes remaining , the ball cannoning in off the keeper ’s right - hand post			2
when he was put through behind the defence four minutes later , there was never any doubt about what would happen , the striker finishing low and hard past a shell - shocked @entity242 .			0

defender @entity32 fired @entity7 ahead in the 50th minute
midfielder @entity18 levelled for the home side eight minutes later
sub @entity0 netted three goals in a *remarkable* 19 - minute spell
@entity4 moved eight points clear at the top of the @entity24
