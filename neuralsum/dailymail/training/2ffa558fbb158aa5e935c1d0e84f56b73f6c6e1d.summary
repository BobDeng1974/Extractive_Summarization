for years , scientists thought that the eternal flame in @entity2 was kept alight by gas produced by ancient , extremely hot rocks			1
however , researchers from @entity6 have discovered that the rocks underneath the @entity8 are n't hot enough to produce this gas , which means another process is producing the gas that 's keeping the flame burning			1
and they have not been able to identify exactly what the process is			0
a small chamber under the waterfall produces natural gas , which keeps the flame alight			0
researchers from @entity6 are unsure the source of this gas , after previous theories were disproved there are thousands of flames around the world that are able to burn constantly because of gas seeping through the soil , or because of man - made structures			1
some of the man - made flames are kept alight for religious reasons , others were lit in honour of famous people who had died , such as the eternal flame at the @entity41 memorial			2
however , natural eternal flames , like the one in @entity2 , are rare			1
this is because natural eternal flames can only be kept alight by gas ' macro seeps '			1
gas usually comes through soil , where bacteria eats the methane converts it into carbon dioxide			0
alternatively , gas comes out in a location where it disappears quickly , so ca n't keep a lit flame burning			0
in the case of the @entity2 flame , a ' macro seep ' of gas comes from a natural hollowed - out chamber			1
because the gas is contained and is n't converted , the flame is kept alight eternally			2
the eternal flame sits behind a waterfall in western @entity2			2
it is said to have been lit thousands of years ago by @entity66			0
there are hundreds of ' natural ' eternal flames around the world , and each one is thought to be kept alight by natural gas produced from the rocks beneath it			1
the gas used to keep the flames burning is thought to come from ancient and extremely hot rocks called shale			1
however , @entity78 and the researchers from @entity6 discovered that rocks beneath the flame in @entity2 are n't hot enough to produce this reaction			1
@entity78 told @entity83 that the rocks were only the temperature of a ' cup of tea '			0
plus , the shale is n't as old as first expected			0
both of these factors mean that the shale beneath the @entity2 flame could n't be creating gas in the same way as other flames around the world			1
and the researchers admitted they are unsure exactly how the @entity2 gas is being produced			0
researchers from @entity6 took several measurements of the eternal flame in @entity2			2
by measuring the size of the flame , the researchers were able to determine how much gas it needed to burn although there are thousands of eternal flames around the world , many are man - made for religious purposes or in honour of famous people who have died , such as president @entity41 at the @entity112			1
however , natural occurring flames are rare because the gas and flame need to live in a specific environment to make sure the gas is n't burnt away or destroyed , and the flame does n't go out @entity78 said : ' we think there 's a different pathway of gas generation in this location and that there probably is elsewhere as well			2
' if that 's true , and gas is naturally produced this way in other locations , we have much more shale - gas resources than we thought , " he added			0
the temperatures , said to be near the boiling point of water or hotter , break down the carbon molecules in the shale and this reaction gives off a natural gas			0
@entity78 and his colleague @entity137 made the discovery as they were studying the amount of methane that is produced by the ground along the east coast of @entity144			0
the eternal flame in @entity2 was said to have been lit thousands of years ago by @entity66 and has been kept alight by naturally formed gas			1
yet researchers from @entity6 have since discovered that the way the gas is produced is different to what was first thought and are unsure of the source this geologic map of western @entity2 and north - western @entity153 shows the locations of eternal flames at @entity8 and @entity156 they also looked at a ' permanently burning pit ' in @entity159 in northwestern @entity153 , although this eternal flame is fuelled by an old gas well			1
the team reported their findings in a study published in the may issue of the journal @entity167 and @entity168			0
the researchers also discovered that the @entity2 gas seep also features the highest concentration of ethane and propane of any seep in the world , according to the study			2
researchers from @entity6 also studied the eternal flame in @entity153			0
this map shows the profile of gas flux measurements at the @entity181 gas seep in , plus the 3d plots of methane flux distribution			0

thousands of eternal flames across the world are usually kept alight by gas formed from boiling hot ancient rocks
rocks found beneath @entity2 flame in @entity8 are n't hot enough to produce this gas
