the plans were agreed by cabinet secretary sir @entity1 who was nicknamed sir cover - up for preventing the @entity5 inquiry ministers were last night struggling to contain a spiralling row about highly contentious plans to bar 430,000 civil servants from talking to journalists			1
critics raised concerns about a quiet change to the civil service code , which they warned could ‘ stifle whistleblowing ’ and open government			1
the code has been amended to include a new provision making clear that officials could be sacked if they speak out before checking with a minister			1
@entity22 was understood to have intervened in the row , forcing the @entity24 to offer a series of concessions			0
cabinet office minister @entity27 agreed to redraft guidance to ‘ strengthen protection ’ for those speaking out to blow the whistle on scandals or abuses of public money , and include a commitment to being ‘ as open as possible ’ with @entity36 and the public			0
however , that is unlikely to appease critics , who have asked why such a change has been enforced just before the general election campaign			0
it appears to have been agreed by sir @entity1 , the cabinet secretary , who has been nicknamed sir @entity2 for preventing the @entity5 inquiry into the @entity45 from seeing letters and records of phone calls between @entity49 and @entity50			0
however , the impetus is understood to have come from ministers , who wanted to control the flow of information from departments to make clear that they , not civil servants , are ultimately in charge			2
a line has been added to the civil service code , which governs officials ’ conduct , saying : ‘ ensure you have ministerial authorisation for any contact with the media			1
’ @entity66 , who chairs the commons public accounts committee , said the @entity24 was ‘ using a sledgehammer to crack a nut ’			2
@entity66 ( pictured ) said the @entity24 was ‘ using a sledgehammer to crack a nut ’ ‘ you do n’t want to encourage briefing against ministers , or criticising people behind their backs , ’ she said			2
‘ but the more openness , the more understanding people have of the way government works , the better			0
’ @entity82 mp @entity81 , who has championed more openness in the health service , said it could stifle whistleblowing			2
‘ it makes sense that the government wants to get its work done without a running commentary from inside the system , but i would like them to set out what they have in place to help people whistleblowing , ’ she said			0
ministers point that out civil servants can blow the whistle on a major scandal using legal protections afforded to them in the @entity103 1988			2
but @entity104 , general secretary of the @entity106 union that represents civil servants , said it was absurd to enforce a ‘ blanket ban ’ on all 430,000 civil servants having unauthorised contacts with journalists			1
mr @entity104 : ‘ civil servants will become worried about every contact they have with the media , and will be looking over their shoulder all the time when talking to the public – as that ’s who they are talking to through the media – about the service they deliver			1
’ the @entity24 insist that the amendment will not affect contacts between journalists and press officers or advisers who regularly speak to the media			1
they insist it simply ‘ clarifies ’ current practice			1
mr @entity27 last night : ‘ the cabinet secretary and i are both clear that no one should be exposed to personal and professional risk for doing what is in the public interest			0
‘ the amendments make no change to the rights of individuals under whistleblowing legislation or our drive to increase government transparency and openness			0
' however , we will consult on strengthening the protections for whistleblowers			0
