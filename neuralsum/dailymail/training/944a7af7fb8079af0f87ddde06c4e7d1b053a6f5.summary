@entity2 ( @entity3 ) is over , and should never be allowed back on @entity5 screens			1
on a scale of one to five , it gets no stars			0
if it were possible to earn a minus rating , it deserves a score of around - 3			1
that ’s not just because of the slack - jawed inanity of the contestants , or the grinding repetition of the same clips and scenes for two dreadful months			0
he was n't hiring an employee this time ; he invested £ 250,000 in a business , in return for 50 per cent equity it is n’t just because the @entity3 has been milking the show to the last rancid drop , squeezing six hours of @entity32 programming into the past fortnight , including a whole segment devoted to childhood retrospectives of the candidates			1
all this , despite insipid ratings — the show launched with just six million viewers , a record low , and has struggled to make any gain on that			0
these figures should , on their own , be sufficient to condemn @entity2 as television landfill			1
half a century after the @entity48 , a three - part series , @entity49 : the @entity50 , started last night on @entity51 , while @entity52 was repeating @entity53 and @entity49 : possession			1
we can only trust @entity48 is not given the satisfaction of watching these programmes			0
worse still is the cossetting of @entity20 ’s ego			0
his tinpot title is echoed dozens of times in every episode — the voiceover , the receptionists , the lackeys , the contestants all chant ‘ @entity66 ’ , ‘ @entity67 ’			1
and when the former barrow - boy thinks he can get away with it , he starts lord sugaring himself			0
recent episodes have seen new ‘ business brains ’ arriving to swell the chorus of praise			2
when one candidate commented on her own talents , a shocked lickspittle gasped : ‘ do n’t ever compare yourself to @entity20 ! ’ the show ’s worst failing is a business one			2
@entity20 has spent 12 episodes selecting his ‘ new business partner ’			2
he was n’t hiring an employee this time ; he invested £ 250,000 in a business , in return for 50 per cent equity			0
victorious : recent episodes of the programme - won this series by @entity93 - have seen new ' business brains ' arriving to swell the chorus of praise to @entity20 several candidates were promising multi-million - pound growth within five years — such profits are improbable , of course , but the @entity3 seems to have tossed away any claim to future income streams			1
@entity66 has already been amply rewarded for his investment			0
there are plenty of narcissists in the corporate world who would mortgage their country cottages , their mercs and their own mothers to be touted endlessly on primetime telly as ‘ a business icon ’			2
sympathy for the crocodiles : in @entity117 ' close encounters , one croc ranger held up a hand to demonstrate what ' interaction ' looked like : two fingers had been bitten off			1
@entity117 is pictured for him to have the chance of a 1,000 per cent return or more , through a state tv channel , is utterly wrong			1
the @entity3 ought surely to have capped his profits , perhaps a maximum of double his money			1
any bank would see that as a fair return			0
and this flags up the great unasked question of the series : if these candidates have good business plans , why not take them to a conventional investor ? by handing over half their companies , and perhaps sacrificing many millions for the arbitrary seed sum of £ 250,000 , they would almost be better off applying for a pay - day loan			0
it was easier to feel sympathy for the 94 - stone salt - water crocodiles on @entity117 ’ @entity143 ( @entity52 ) than for @entity20			1
the crocs were being hauled out of @entity146 harbour on ropes , before duct tape was wound around their jaws and the presenter stood on their heads to subdue them			0
‘ this is an outstanding example of modern conservation , ’ @entity117 insisted			1
the captures helped to ‘ stop interaction between crocodiles and the public ’			2
one croc ranger held up a hand to demonstrate what ‘ interaction ’ looked like : two fingers had been bitten off			2
you ca n’t always blame the reptiles when tragedies happen			0
one man was photographed attempting to surf on the back of a croc			0
two girls were pictured sunbathing on a wire cage containing a snared , and very disgruntled , ‘ saltie ’			2
‘ alcohol is usually involved in these cases , ’ @entity117 told us , straight - faced			1
any boozed up @entity175 who survives a croc attack will learn their lesson			0
but do @entity3 executives have the same basic common sense not to get bitten again ? watch @entity2 final on @entity183			1
