the advertising campaign for @entity2 's new high - end milk has been heavily criticized for apparent ' sexism '			1
featuring pictures of naked women dripping in barely - there dresses made of milk , @entity4 is being launched to much fanfare this month in the @entity11			1
the photographs , which appear to be working under the logic that ' sex sells ' , are loosely based on iconic poses from the past , such as @entity17 's famous skirt rising in @entity18			0
with falling sales in their traditional soda division , @entity2 are pinning a lot on @entity4 , especially on the pin - ups they are using to sell it			1
the cheeky and controversial photographs have slogans such as ' drink what she 's wearing ' , ' more good , looks good ' and ' better milk looks good on you			1
' one particular picture has one of the models standing on a set of scales wearing a horrified expression , presumably because she needs to be drinking @entity4			1
attractive : @entity2 is hoping that its new high - end milk will help combat its falling sales among sugary soda drinks revealing ? the advertising campaign for @entity4 - which emulates the famous @entity17 skirt billow from @entity18 - has set tongues wagging and tempers rising on social media anger : @entity20 users took to the social media network to get their anger off their chests and complain about @entity2 ' we ’ll charge twice as much for it as the milk we ’re used to buying ' , said @entity64 , @entity65 ’s global chief customer officer , to a launch conference last week			1
however , the way the women are being represented and used to to sell milk has left many on social media annoyed			1
one @entity20 user , @entity74 posted , ' in case you missed : ads for @entity65 's new milk brand show nude women , covered in milk , being weighed			2
another poster , rebel girl @entity80 called the campaign a ' sexist rubbish ( trash ) throwback advertising from @entity2 for milk ... keep the 70s in the 70s ! ' @entity90 wrote on the social media site , ' @ @entity65 's newest brand @ fairlife has arguably the worst ad campaign i 've seen			1
women dressed in milk ? # fail # @entity99 # advertising			2
regardless , there is a lot riding on @entity4 for @entity2			2
as @entity11 cut down on unhealthy soft drinks , @entity2 has turned to creating a premium type of milk to boost their dwindling profits			2
' it 's basically the premiumization of milk , ' @entity64 , a senior vice president at @entity2 's @entity111 operation at the @entity112 last week			0
launch : featuring pictures of naked women dripping in barely - there dresses made of milk , @entity4 is being launched to much fanfare this month in the @entity11 moove over @entity2 : the advertisements for @entity4 not only depict women in milk dresses that cling closely to their bodies , they advertise the health benefits of the product such as more calcium the company has had success in advertising healthier beverages with their simply juice line which has done well despite the fruit juice industry starting to slump			1
fruit juices are also packed with sugars and are a major contributor along with soft drinks to childhood obesity			0
@entity139 reports that @entity2 advertises simply juices as being healthier , unsweetened , and never frozen			0
our ambition there is to create the simply of milk , ' @entity64 said of the new product			2
@entity111 shoppers have flocked towards higher protein products like @entity148 and less are buying items with high sugar contents			0
' protein is the fastest - growing segment of the beverage category , ' @entity151 , president of @entity154 's @entity153 business unit , told the @entity158			0
despite the growing popularity of high protein products , @entity158 reports that one of every two adults does n't drink milk at all			2
milk sales have also declined by 8 per cent over the last ten years			0
coming soon : @entity4 milk will be on shelves starting in late december and will cost twice the price of regular milk because it is supposedly healthier than traditional milk what @entity2 aims to do is advertise how @entity4 is healthier than traditional milk because it 's cold - filtered to concentrate protein and remove fat and sugar			1
@entity2 already sells a protein shake called @entity175 which goes through the same filtration process			0
in order to build hype around the new milk , @entity2 has developed provocative ads which they launched earlier this year in @entity182 of women wearing dresses made from milk , reports @entity186			1
' swing into something better , ' says one advertisement picturing a woman in a dress made of milk hanging from a swing			0
' milk with flair , ' reads another ad picturing a woman in a dress made from milk that resembles an iconic image of @entity17 in a white dress			0
despite the milk industry being on the decline , @entity2 believes that their premium product equipped with a premium price tag will reel in the cash flow			1
' now to be clear , we 're going to be investing in the milk business for a while to build the brand so it wo n't rain money in the early couple of years , ' @entity64 said at last week 's conference			0
' but like simply , when you do it well , it rains money later			0
