the jockey they all struggle to beat but also a rider no sane jockey would attempt to emulate			1
that is the verdict of colleague @entity5 when trying to explain what has made @entity7 such a dominant force in his sport			1
@entity10 winner @entity5 has been one of the few weighing room colleagues to witness @entity7 's entire career , from shy newcomer to national sporting superstar			1
@entity7 will race at @entity15 on saturday for the last time before he retires following a successful career @entity7 has two rides at @entity15 on saturday before he retires from professional racing for good ' it is a bit like watching @entity21 on a horse , ' said @entity5			1
' he had so much time but he has a technique you would n't teach to anybody			1
' it might sound like madness when you are talking about a 20 - time champion but it is unique			1
he keeps the bit high up in the horse 's mouth though the general rule is to drop your hands on the back of your mount 's neck			1
but @entity41 loves to be in 100 per cent control			2
whatever his mount does , it is his decision			2
' he judges pace so well			2
he leaves his runs later now and he adapted his style since he started riding for @entity49			2
' when he was with @entity51 , it was often a case of make sure you put everyone to the sword a mile from home			2
he would probably even admit he got some horses beaten around @entity58 in the early days that would not get beaten now			2
' he is very aware of what is going on around him			0
if you look at this year 's @entity62 , and when he won it in 2010 on @entity63 , he had so much room			0
he finds room in a race and uses it			0
' you also never know how much he has left in the tank			0
you very rarely see him sitting still			0
it is a bit like a coiled spring			0
' @entity7 ( left ) and wife @entity71 will host a party at home on sunday for family and friends @entity5 , who needs fewer than 20 winners to reach 1,000 in his career , says age has mellowed @entity7 , who is an unassuming figure among his colleagues			1
former jockey @entity81 , now a tv presenter for at the races , agrees			1
' he has never been the big ' i am '			0
' i used to run the @entity86 pub in @entity87 and he would come along even though he does n't drink			0
' he would stand in and play for the pool team and what p * * * ed you off was that he was good at that as well			0
@entity7 and mr @entity92 will have six rivals in the @entity94 at @entity15 on saturday ' before he was married , his home was like a doss house , full of jockeys who got back late from racing and could not be bothered to go home			1
' @entity100 ( now a @entity87 trainer ) bought a house but liked living at @entity41 's so much he rented it out and stayed at @entity41 's			0
' @entity103 , champion flat jockey , is impressed by @entity7 's legendary focus			1
' i was on holiday with him in @entity107			0
@entity41 played two days ' golf , flew home to ride at @entity110 and then back out to play the final day			1
we told him he was mad			0

@entity7 has his final two rides at @entity15 in @entity115 on saturday
no sane jockey would ever try to emulate 20 - time champion jockey
@entity7 will be *hoping* to bow out on a winner with @entity121 at saturday
the @entity15 track is completely sold out as fans bid farewell to a hero
