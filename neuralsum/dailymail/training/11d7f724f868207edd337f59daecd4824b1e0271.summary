@entity0 was banned from the star - studded birthday party of his public relations mogul son - in - law @entity2 in a tit - for - tat family conflict linked to @entity5 ’s relationship with mr @entity0 ’s ex-wife @entity6			1
and last night mr @entity0 and mr @entity2 were embroiled in a public war of words as the repercussions of the @entity11 controversy spread			1
the latest development came after @entity13 learned that mr @entity2 , married to mr @entity0 ’s daughter @entity14 , axed his father - in - law from the guest list for his 50th birthday party last month			1
it was the latest , dramatic sign of mr @entity2 ’s support for mr @entity5 in the former prime minister ’s own dispute with mr @entity0 , who divorced ms @entity6 three months ago			1
the way they were : the now fragmented and warring @entity0 - @entity2 alliance pose for a family snap back in 2008 the @entity27 snub came after mr @entity0 had mr @entity5 barred from attending a media summit in the @entity29 after finding a note suggesting ms @entity6 had a ‘ crush ’ on him and discovering the pair had spent weekends at mr @entity0 ’s homes without his knowledge			1
mr @entity5 and wife @entity36 were star guests at mr @entity2 ’s celebrity - studded party at his @entity40 mansion , with his father - in - law conspicuously absent			1
a long - standing friend of mr @entity0 said mr @entity2 ’s move was ‘ a very public v - sign to @entity0 ’			1
and in a surprise move , both men intervened publicly last night , in a courteous but loaded @entity47 confirmed he had fallen out with mr @entity0 , saying their views ‘ differed dramatically ’ on several issues , causing ‘ conflict ’ between them			2
they both loved @entity14 , mr @entity2 ’s wife and mr @entity0 ’s daughter , he said , adding pointedly ‘ if not always each other ’			2
close friends : @entity2 with @entity5 and mr @entity2 bluntly challenged the claim that mr @entity0 was upset to be excluded from the party , saying : ‘ he has said nothing to me personally			1
’ but a source close to mr @entity0 hit back , saying : ‘ @entity2 and @entity0 have no relationship and so none of this is a surprise			1
’ other sources close to mr @entity0 last night accused mr @entity2 of cultivating mr @entity0 ’s ex-wife @entity63 to antagonise him			1
and they say the @entity0 - @entity2 battle has affected mr @entity0 ’s relationship with daughter @entity66			2
the family infighting comes after @entity13 revealed the link between mr @entity5 ’s relationship with ms @entity6 and the @entity70 ’ marriage breakdown – and how it caused a ‘ terminal ’ rift in relations between mr @entity0 and mr @entity5			1
mr @entity5 denies he had an affair with ms @entity6			2
a source at mr @entity0 ’s @entity78 company in the @entity79 said : ‘ @entity0 is particularly upset that @entity2 and @entity14 held a party at exactly the time when rumours were circulating about @entity63 and @entity5			1
@entity0 was n’t invited but @entity5 was			0
that was a very public v - sign to @entity0			2
‘ @entity2 has been sending crazy 3am emails to @entity0 making all sorts of accusations			0
@entity14 is stuck in the middle and it has had a devastating effect on her relations with @entity0			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s supporters claim mr @entity2 ‘ joined forces ’ with ms @entity6 in his own battle with mr @entity0			2
‘ he set out to cultivate her as an ally , saying all sorts of negative stuff to her about @entity0 , ’ a friend said			0
in addition , the @entity0 camp accuse mr @entity2 of orchestrating a ‘ briefing war ’ against him after mr @entity0 ’s fury with mr @entity5 was revealed			1
‘ @entity0 believes the stuff reported in the @entity104 about him being a sad old man who has lost the plot has been put out there by @entity2 , ’ said one source			0
‘ the galling thing for @entity0 is that when @entity2 married @entity14 , he cashed in on the @entity0 name			0
now he is going around trashing @entity109			0
’ four months before @entity2 ’s birthday bash , it was mr @entity5 who was missing when he was ‘ disinvited ’ from the high - profile @entity113 media conference in @entity115 , after mr @entity0 told organisers he would boycott it if mr @entity5 turned up			1
the @entity109 dispute is the latest development in the fast spreading fall - out between @entity0 and mr @entity5 over ms @entity6 , which has sent shockwaves through their close - knit and wealthy social circle			1
mr @entity0 discovered his wife had ' multiple encounters ' with mr @entity5 , including weekend strays at mr @entity0 's @entity29 homes without his knowledge @entity125 reports that their 14 - year marriage was in trouble came to a head earlier this year when mr @entity0 discovered his wife had ‘ multiple encounters ’ with mr @entity5 , including weekend strays at mr @entity0 ’s @entity29 homes without his knowledge			2
weeks later , mr @entity0 filed for divorce			0
friends of mr @entity5 stress that he was ‘ not cited in the divorce proceedings ’			0
mr @entity2 , 50 , is one of the most powerful and best connected men in @entity79			0
he and @entity14 , who he married in 2001 , have a joint fortune of £ 250 million			0
the success of mr @entity2 , great grandson of psychoanalyst @entity138 , owes much to his pragmatic approach to business and politics – aided by generous entertaining			0
he counts mr @entity5 , mr @entity142 and former @entity144 editor @entity143 as close @entity146 pr company @entity145 advises @entity147 , @entity148 , drinks company @entity149 – and the @entity150			2
mr @entity152 s supporters claim mr @entity2 ' joined forces ' with ms @entity6 in his own battle with mr @entity0 the @entity0 - @entity2 dispute over mr @entity5 comes amid an increasingly bitter rivalry between the two men , linked to the battle to inherit the media empire of 82 - year - old mr @entity0			1
mr @entity2 told @entity13 last night : ‘ it would be very sad if these opinions apparently anonymously attributed to my father - in - law are accurate			2
he has certainly said nothing to me personally			0
‘ i will be eternally grateful to @entity0 for producing @entity14 , who is practically perfect in every way			0
our views differ quite dramatically on a number of subjects professionally and i regret that this has caused my relationship with him to be sometimes conflicted			0
‘ but we have had good times as well as bad times , we both love his daughter and his grandchildren , if not always each other			0
‘ i do not believe anything else is terribly important			0

a source close to @entity0 said snub was a ' very public v - sign '
mr @entity5 and @entity36 were guests of *honour* at *glittering* bash
mr @entity2 confirmed ' dramatically ' differing views has caused ' conflict '
