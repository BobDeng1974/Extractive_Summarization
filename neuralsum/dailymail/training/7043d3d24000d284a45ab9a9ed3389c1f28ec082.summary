by @entity0 published : 09:30 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 09:33 est , 20 march 2013 a ' @entity2 ' scheme which will see residents gathering information for police investigations has been criticised due to the risks involved			0
@entity8 police are asking volunteers to take part in @entity11 , where ' back - up bobbies ' will share information and be asked to help officers notify residents after break - ins in @entity16			1
it is the first scheme of its kind in the country and police chiefs have hailed it as a way of getting more information from people who might otherwise be reluctant to speak to officers			0
however , the plans from the force - which has to cut £ 42million from its budget by 2015 - have been called into question			1
@entity31 are asking volunteers to take part in @entity11 , where citizen police in @entity16 will be asked to gather information after break - ins ( file picture , left )			1
the @entity2 ( scene from sitcom , right ) scheme will also see the back - up bobbies help spread crime prevention messages concerns have been raised that volunteers could put themselves in dangerous situations , with nobody there to help them			1
resident @entity46 , 36 , said : ' it is policing on the cheap - something that the officers would have done themselves previously			2
' who is going to give the members of the public the protection or back - up ? ' you can call 999 but i would be worried			1
surely there are other ways to cut spending and still have the police available to do their work rather than asking the public to step in ? ' and @entity64 , the town 's neighbourhood watch @entity65 , also questioned the motivation behind @entity11			2
he said : ' it all sounds great in principle but is n't it just policing on the cheap to make up for all the cuts ? ' i do n't see who they will get because the people who come forward will be those already involved in the community			0
' chief inspector @entity81 ( above ) , the man who came up with the plan , said he believes officers are currently only getting about 25 per cent of information about crimes chief inspector @entity81 , the man who came up with the plan , said : ' @entity11 aims to raise public awareness of crime by providing an opportunity for people in the community to work with the police to help spread crime prevention messages and get a greater understanding of police work			1
' there is no question of any member of the public being asked to carry out any police enquiries or act in any front - line policing capacity			2
' this is not about replacing police with members of the public - it is about engaging with the community to help develop intelligence about what crime is occurring and who is doing it			1
' at the moment , we believe we receive about 25 per cent of the information held by members of the public in relation to crime in their communities			0
' the aim of this initiative is to increase that percentage significantly			0
it involves @entity31 in partnership with the @entity124 and @entity125 and we are still looking at the finer details of how this will work in practice			2
' police are currently checking issues for their volunteers such as insurance in case they are hurt while taking part in the operation			0
@entity136 , the @entity16 borough councillor in charge of community safety , said he was in favour of getting the public to be back - up bobbies			1
he said : ' i have had an initial meeting with mr @entity81 and support the idea of getting the public to assist			0
' any way that we can work together to combat crime and anti-social behaviour should be welcomed			0
' the volunteer scheme is set to focus on burglaries in neighbourhoods across @entity16 after 400 were committed in just four months leading up to january 2013			2
this is not the first unique initiative launched by @entity8 police			0
during @entity158 in 2007 , anti-social behaviour offenders were followed and filmed by police around the district of @entity161			0
@entity11 will be launched in @entity16 ( above ) later this year but the plans from the force - which has to cut £ 42m from its budget by 2015 - have been called into question for possibly endangering the lives of the volunteers			1

@entity169 will be *rolled* out in @entity16 later this year
back - up bobbies will also help to spread crime prevention messages
concerns that the volunteers could end up in dangerous situations
@entity31 needs to cut £ 42m from its budget by 2015
