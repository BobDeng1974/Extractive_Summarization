by @entity0 published : 12:25 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 20:51 est , 14 june 2012 a @entity2 doctor yesterday claimed he was a victim of religious discrimination after being disciplined for discussing his faith with a suicidal patient			1
@entity6 , 51 , a former medical missionary , was reprimanded despite the 24 - year - old complainant not even having to turn up to give evidence			1
instead , he was allowed to give his version of events over the telephone and behind closed doors against the @entity14 - educated gp			2
dr @entity6 said he was ' disgusted ' with the ruling and said that if this was a matter regarding a @entity18 or person living by spiritual practice @entity21 , they would not be in his position dr @entity6 told a disciplinary panel he offered the troubled patient spiritual guidance after first checking that he did not mind			1
but the man ’s mother complained ten days later about the consultation at his practice in @entity30 , @entity31			2
she said her son was told he would ‘ suffer ’ and be ‘ haunted by the devil ’ if he did not turn ‘ towards @entity35 ’ from his faith , which has not been revealed			0
yesterday , the @entity36 ruled against the married father - of - three in favour of the man known as @entity40 it imposed an official warning and told the gp that any repetition could lead to tougher action , potentially resulting in being struck off			1
the hearing was stayed last year after @entity46 refused to attend a disciplinary panel in @entity48			0
it went ahead this week when he was allowed to testify by phone and in secret			0
this was described by dr @entity6 , who is currently unable to work as he fights cancer , as an ‘ outrageous ’ denial of a fair trial			1
he was supported by @entity58 , of the @entity59 , which had backed his case			0
‘ our society seems to be becoming more repressive , with ordinary , decent people being disciplined just for expressing their @entity2 beliefs , ’ she said			1
their website states that all six partners are @entity2 and believe in discussing faith as part of their work dr @entity6 added : ‘ i ’m yet another @entity2 being slammed for approaching their faith at work			1
‘ the panel has chosen to believe a patient with massive and multiple problems against a doctor of 28 years ’ standing			0
’ he declared : ‘ i will continue to raise the issue of faith where relevant because it ’s for the patient ’s benefit			0
’ dr @entity6 pictured outside the @entity36 hearing in @entity48 last year the case started in august 2010 when @entity46 saw dr @entity6 at @entity88 , which states that all its doctors are practising @entity2			1
the gp claimed he made a ‘ gentle offer ’ to broach the subject of faith and the man replied : ‘ go for it ’			0
but the @entity90 said the patient quickly ‘ cut up rough ’ and told him it was ‘ a load of b * * * * * * s ’			0
last night , the former archbishop of @entity101 said : ‘ i ’m extremely saddened by this ruling			0
‘ many @entity2 will be asking whether they any longer have the freedom to express their faith			2
‘ i urge them to continue to do so in the manner of dr @entity6 , with respect for others and compassion for all			1
’ dr @entity110 , chief executive of the @entity111 , accused the @entity36 of succumbing to ‘ militant secularism ’			1
he added : ‘ good doctors do not treat their patients solely as biological or biochemical machines but practise “ whole person ” medicine			0
’ last night , @entity36 chief executive @entity118 said : ‘ this is not about religion			2
it is about respecting patients and making sure doctors do not use the incredibly privileged position they hold to push their own beliefs			0
’ other @entity2 medical staff have also lost cases over their faith , including a nurse in a row over wearing her crucifix on duty and a doctor stopped from advising on adoption as she refused to endorse gay couples .			2

dr @entity6 remains *defiant* saying @entity36 is discriminating against @entity2 .
