it 's just not cricket without @entity1 behind the microphone and so the summer of @entity3 matches in @entity4 will conclude at the @entity5 , without the legend calling a ball			1
the veteran of the @entity10 commentary team is unlikely to make his much anticipated return at his home - town test beginning on tuesday			1
the @entity10 had left the door open for @entity1 , 84 , to return in the fourth and final match between @entity4 and @entity15 , ever since he appeared at their summer of cricket launch at the same ground a month ago			2
however , @entity10 's head of sport @entity19 confirmed that @entity1 had n't been in touch about working at the test and he accepted it would n't happen			2
the commentating icon will not be heard calling the game as he continues his battle with ill health @entity1 has led the @entity10 commentary team since the days of @entity33 began in 1977 , after a stellar all - ground career for his country legendary cricket commentator @entity1 will not be heard during the final test match of the summer in @entity4 as he recovers from health problems			1
he has however signed on to be a ' lambassador ' for the @entity40 celebrations later this month @entity1 may be known as the voice of @entity43 cricket , but now he 's using his marvellous tones to spruik lamb ahead of @entity40			1
he 's taken on a role of alongside regular ' lambassador ' , @entity48 legend @entity47 , in this year 's @entity40 lamb campaign			1
' to me , @entity40 is the perfect excuse to get together with friends and family over a bbq and enjoy some delicious lamb chops , ' the former @entity43 captain said			2
the ad campaign featuring two of the country 's best loved sporting greats is about to be rolled out			0
@entity1 has been a regular during the @entity60 summer too , featuring in many as a commentator over the past four decades			2
here he is pictured at the @entity63 during an @entity65 battle			0
he is unlikely to be make it back to the commentary box during the current @entity43 summer as he battles health problems @entity1 has taken on legendary status in his homeland , the silver fox looks and beige jacket a staple during @entity43 summers - even leading to fans mimicking his look at last year 's @entity78 in @entity79 the 84 - year - old has been absent from the @entity10 's cricket commentary team this summer while he battles skin cancer			1
' he 's a man of great manners and he knows that the offer is there and he would have made contact by now , ' @entity19 said			0
he has n't returned to the commentary box since a car crash left him with two crushed vertebrae 15 months ago and he revealed at @entity10 's cricket launch on december 6 that he was also undergoing treatment for cancer			1
' to me , @entity40 is the perfect excuse to get together with friends and family over a bbq and enjoy some delicious lamb chops ' the former @entity43 captain said			2
@entity1 will feature in an ad campaign ahead of @entity40 there had been speculation @entity1 could even contribute to the commentary from his lounge - room in seaside suburb @entity103 , but that too is unlikely			1
' i very much doubt he 'll be calling over the next five days , ' @entity19 said			0
' but if he did decide to jump in a taxi and get over to the @entity5 , well , the door is always open to him			0
' @entity19 said only @entity1 would decide if and when he got behind the microphone again			0
' with @entity110 we just want him to get better , ' @entity19 said			0
' @entity111 is his health and recovery			0
' @entity1 has been heard in pre-recorded snippets this summer , including a brief tribute to the late @entity115 during the 1st test in @entity117 and a small segment for the @entity3 in @entity119 where he recounted his battle with illness and his gradual recovery at home			0

@entity1 has been battling health issues after skin cancer treatment and a car *accident*
@entity10 *bosses* were so keen to have the cricket legend involved they *explored* *possibility* of @entity1 calling games from his lounge - room
the cricket icon has not been a part of the commentary team since his crash 15 months ago
but @entity1 is *sinking* his teeth into a new role , as a ' lambassador ' alongside @entity48 great @entity47 ahead of @entity40
