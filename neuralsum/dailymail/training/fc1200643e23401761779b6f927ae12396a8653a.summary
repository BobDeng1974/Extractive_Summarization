by @entity0 published : 19:44 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 03:29 est , 24 july 2013 welcome to the @entity1 ! believe me , it ’s the place to be — not the slightest bit exclusive , but with terrific benefits			1
from now on , i guarantee , you ’ll have a fresh take on life and love			1
nowadays , grandmotherhood does n’t conjure up pictures of white - haired old ladies in rocking chairs			1
you and i are more likely to be in jeans and funky boots			1
proud : @entity16 and @entity17 , the parents of @entity19 , smile as they arrive at @entity20 thrilled : both beamed with pride following their visit but still , this is a brand new phase of life			1
suddenly , middle age becomes magnificent			1
becoming a grandparent is an astonishing transformation , no matter who you are			1
it happened to me last year when my grandson was born in june and my granddaughter in september			1
yes , two came along and i ’m amazed by the way the small people have changed my life			1
i ’m not just referring to the inevitable demands on time and attention , but a jolt into a different way of being			1
you ’ll find out now			1
already you ’ve made a brilliant start			1
most grandmothers rush eagerly to the hospital as soon as they can , but you wisely held back on the first day , knowing just how much @entity48 and @entity49 wanted that quiet , private time with their new son			1
when you walked into the @entity51 at last , you saw the eyes ( and lenses ) of the world focused on seeing the royal baby — who is also , first and foremost , your grandson			1
grandmother knows best : @entity58 of @entity59 pictured earlier this year with her mother @entity60 buying a baby cot useful : @entity0 with daughter @entity62 and baby @entity64 it must have been daunting as well as exciting to realise how important your role will be in helping to shape his young life			1
i remember my mother telling me that when you have your own child , you ’re young , busy and stressed , but when grandchildren arrive , you have changed			1
you ’re calmer , wiser and ready to give that precious commodity : time			1
more than that , grandmotherhood can involve a subtle shift in your personality			1
obviously , this does n’t work for all women			1
but it has for me			1
nature has designed older females for a vital role within the family			1
our child - bearing years are over and we possess the confidence of middle age , knowing who and what we are , with nothing to prove			1
now is the perfect moment to assume the all - important mantle of @entity95			1
mind you , the transformation is gradual			1
of course , i made all the obvious noises of delight when the babies were born and naturally felt proud and excited			2
but you do n’t necessarily fall in love with your grandchildren overnight			2
initially , your thoughts will be with your daughter — your own baby — wanting her to be happy , to cope , to grow into the role of parent and perform it brilliantly			2
then you look at the little bundle in your arms and realise this strange new creature is about to make demands on you — and for years			2
that can make you anxious			2
i found myself wondering if i could be as competent , energetic and self - sacrificing as my parents were when i had my children , @entity117 and @entity62			1
delighted : the @entity118 and @entity19 with their newborn son depart the @entity51 of @entity20 content : the couple could barely contain their happiness as they showed their new born baby off to the world what if i did n’t want to sit on the floor with a baby and a pile of plastic bricks ? would i ( yuk ! ) get used to stinky nappies all over again ? i hoped i ’d grow into the role , but felt nervous			2
maybe you feel that way , too			2
the first lesson i learned was to keep quiet			2
having brought up our own children , you and i think we know what we ’re doing			2
but woe betide you if a view escapes your lips unasked for ! believe me , your daughter ( yes , even serene @entity19 ) will soon put you in your place			2
the first time i took care of my granddaughter for the evening , i fed her and changed her nappy , then put her back in the wrong place in the crib			2
imagine ! i had to bite my tongue when @entity62 demanded to know why			2
remember , new mums are anxious			2
if the first rule of grandmotherhood is not to say ‘ i did it this way ’ or ask ‘ why do you need to do that ? ’ , the second rule is not to bridle			0
do n’t endlessly bleat over the baby and blurt out opinions			0
this is their gig , not ours ! that ’s what i mean by a subtle shift in your personality			0
even a control freak like me ( and , i suspect , you ) has to learn to step back			0
when @entity49 wants advice , she might ask for it , but sometimes you ’ll feel irritated because she does n’t realise she jolly well needs it			0
even if you murmur something loving , such as ‘ @entity179 , do n’t worry quite so much — it ’ll be fine ’ , you ’ll be wounded if she bites your head off			0
so step back and save yourself a stab of pain			0
and when you make mistakes , just shrug and be relaxed			0
the new parents make the rules about food and bedtime , and we have to obey them			1
with all the pressure on @entity49 , it would be astonishing if in private she remains as unflappable as she seems in public			0
so it ’s all the more important for you , as her mother , to be calm and @entity196 instruction , but maximum reassurance			0
our daughters need strong support and do n’t want us to neglect them in favour of the baby			0
it seems to me essential to remember that you are mum first and @entity204 second			0
that ’s why it ’s important to tell your daughter how well she is doing as she gradually learns to play the most important role in the world : being a mother			0
but above all — enjoy ! as i write this , ten - month - old @entity64 is on my knee because her mum , my daughter , is at an evening course and her husband is helping to bring in hay bales from our field			0
to type this , i ’m trying to reach around baby , who keeps banging the keyboard , so i have to delete her contributions			0
once , i ’d have been frustrated by such a scene and want someone — anyone — to take the baby			0
now , though , it makes me laugh			0
i ca n’t tell you the delight of realising you want to work less and play more			0
that ’s the glorious thing about the @entity1 — it ’s a passport to optimism and @entity235 ’ve even learned to love that irritating pad of middle - aged spread on my hips , because i see what it ’s for : a perfect seat for a baby			0
there ’s a new sense of usefulness and of youth , too			0
in a moment , i will change @entity64 ’s nappy , give her a bottle and put her to bed — and i ca n’t wait for a goodnight cuddle			0
the smell of my grandchildren ’s heads takes me back to being a young mother			0
and so life moves in a wonderful arc			0
i feel completed — and i hope you do , too			0
what else is there to say ? just this : that no matter his status from birth , the relentless public scrutiny or what the future holds , when snuggled in your arms he is just a lovely baby and you are just a normal , proud grandmother			0
build a fortress around that private love , @entity16			0
he will need it .			0
