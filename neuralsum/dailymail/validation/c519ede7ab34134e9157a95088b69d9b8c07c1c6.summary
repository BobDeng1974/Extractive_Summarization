' her parents have defended their daughter saying she is ' not the villain the media is portraying her to be ' and was only trying to help @entity7 , who had been suffering from depression			1

' he further explained that ( @entity12 ) was getting so involved in it , and he was just curious about how she knew @entity59 , and @entity4 said that they had been dating on and off for two years and ( he ) said at that point that he had never heard of her , so he did n't know exactly if that was true or not			1
