it 's the hilarious new craze for animal lovers - transporting your pet back to a bygone age of grandeur by having it morphed into an @entity8 portrait			1
the results are priceless , and rumour has it the trend has even come to the attention of the @entity14 with an enquiry recently made			0
perhaps someone was thinking of a present for the @entity19 's 88th birthday a couple of weeks ago			1
@entity20 helps to turn people 's pets into portraits , here she has transformed one of the @entity19 's corgis into @entity26 photographer and designer @entity20 tapped into a tendency to put our pets on pedestals when she created her company @entity32 - and now cats , dogs and even parrots can become emperors , dukes , statesmen , kings and queens			1
look through the gallery online and you 'll see a menagerie of pets posing with the utmost seriousness in velvet , ermine and lace , with crowns on their heads and sceptres in their paws			1
they sit on thrones or pose at writing desks			0
they paint , they sew			0
two pug dog sisters hold paws as @entity61 ladies			0
a parrot is @entity64 's @entity63			1
' we look at the pictures and ca n't stop laughing , ' says @entity20			0
but there 's something particularly hysterical about recreating the @entity14 's dogs as @entity71 nobility			1
it 's reigning cats and dogs : one dog 's take on @entity76 , and @entity77 the cat as @entity79 by @entity80 so , for weekend readers , the @entity32 has transported @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity85 's black spaniel , back to the @entity87 court of the 16th century , where he poses as prince @entity88 , son of @entity89 - a proud prince with blue blood heritage , just like his not - so - old master			1
poor prince @entity88 became wild and unpredictable after suffering a head injury falling down stairs , and once forced a shoemaker to eat shoes he found unsatisfactory			0
@entity82 probably likes to chew a good royal shoe too			1
@entity99 's @entity98 and @entity100 have been turned into a pair of 16th - century @entity103 noble children , adapted from a painting by @entity105 of her younger sisters , while either of the @entity19 's corgis @entity108 and @entity109 could become @entity26 , the tragic distant cousin of @entity110 who was appointed @entity111 of @entity112 after her husband @entity76 died			1
@entity114 : cow and chewy as @entity112 bluebloods three of @entity110 's sons became @entity120 of @entity112 , and as well as being credited with inventing the corset she was in charge of @entity112 's 16th - century spies - a fitting relative for the dogs who met @entity128 @entity127 when their mistress was filmed for the @entity130 in 2012			1
' her majesty has so many portraits of her ancestors on her walls , ' says @entity20 , ' what could be better than having her beloved corgis posing regally alongside them ? after all , pets are family			1
' what gave @entity20 , 52 , the idea to start the @entity32 ? ' two reasons , ' she says			1
' i absolutely love animals , and in a short space of time i lost my @entity148 blue cat called @entity77 of 18 - and - a - half years and my sister @entity149 , who died of cancer			1
two pooches pose as @entity153 's @entity152 a parrot poses as @entity64 's @entity63 , and @entity155 the mongrel as a 17th century gentleman ' @entity77 was my baby			2
i always saw him as @entity158			0
he was a little thing but very commanding with lots of cattitude			0
somehow having him as @entity158 on my wall for always made everything better			0
there was so much sadness but i turned it into something fun , creative and playful			0
' she thinks cats work particularly well as ancient royals , and shows me a hilarious portrait of a ginger cat as @entity173 ' i 've grown up with cats , ' she says			2
' i 've had them all my life , and perhaps cats are funnier than dogs			2
' @entity179 , 30 , the artist who works on the pet portraits , adds , ' dogs tend to have bigger personalities that are easier to see			1
cats are often more distant , so seeing them like this is just so funny			0
' she diverts me to one of her favourite commissions , two @entity187 tabby moggies called @entity188 posing as 18th - century @entity112 aristocrats @entity190 and @entity191 , @entity192			2
' see , they make you crack up			0
' what @entity85 and @entity82 might look like as a 16th century @entity87 prince a dog named @entity201 ( after the @entity202 ) poses as @entity203 and what @entity99 's @entity98 and @entity100 might look like as 16th century sisters @entity179 has turned her own mongrel , a rescue dog called @entity155 , into a gentleman from the 17th century in a scarlet and chestnut frock coat and fancy white shirt and cravat			1
he 's transformed instantly from scruffy dog to hound of importance			2
' now i look at pets and i see them as @entity8			2
for instance when the picture of a parrot came in i could only see @entity64 's @entity63			2
i encourage people to send as many photos as they can so i can work on the best one			0
the more options the better , so i get a better idea of the pet 's personality			2
' one client wrote back - stories about what each of his cats did in this other royal life			2
they had museum - style plaques made depicting a fictional history for the cats in the pictures as long - distant relatives of their current cats			0
if people want two pets in one painting we find an @entity8 with two figures			0
we want to be challenged			0
' most people supply their own photos - it helps if there are several with the face at many angles and shots of paws so that @entity179 can get the most authentic match to the original painting			0
anyone can contact the @entity32 online and they 'll advise you on how to capture a variety of angles to show your pet at its best - they recommend straight on and at eye level , not from above or below			1
the costs vary according to the size and the type of frame you choose , ranging from a small stretched canvas ( 5x5in ) from around £ 100 to a large framed canvas ( 11x14in ) at just over £ 200 , plus shipping			1
not a princely sum to pay for a unique ancestral pawtrait			0

@entity32 transforms pets into portraits fit for the queen
they transform @entity85 , @entity82 and the @entity19 's dogs into blue - bloods
a framed portrait only costs around £ 200
