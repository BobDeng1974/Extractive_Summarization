@entity1 captain @entity0 has told his team - mates there are ' no excuses ' now the transition period is over			1
@entity0 made his first appearance of the season in @entity1 's 2 - 1 @entity8 win over @entity9 on saturday after a torn hamstring ruled him out of @entity12 's difficult start as manager			1
the victory over the @entity9 was @entity1 's first in five games and supporters are still reeling from their failure to qualify for the @entity18 against @entity19 despite an initial reprieve following an administrative error by @entity22			1
@entity1 captain @entity0 has told his team - mates there are ' no excuses ' now the transition period is over but @entity1 can give @entity12 a much - needed boost if they get their @entity28 campaign off to a winning start when they take on @entity30 in @entity31 on thursday			1
@entity0 , who was speaking to promote @entity33 's exclusively live coverage of the game , said : ' it 's always hard when a new manager comes in and has three weeks before his first @entity18 qualifier			1
' ever since then , i have seen glimpses of how we are going to play and we are getting better and better every game			2
' now we have to put it into 90 minutes and not just 60 or 70			0
' you have to have faith in him			0
everyone sees the good football we are trying to play			0
it 's all going to come together as soon as possible and hopefully that will be thursday			0
manager @entity12 has endured a difficult start at @entity1 and failed to make it into the @entity18 ' it 's just been getting used to the new shape and new players			1
now the transfer window is closed , that 's our squad settled			0
we 've got no excuses now			2
' we have to try and push on and start playing the football we know we can play			0
we did really well against @entity9 and those three points were a boost			2
' @entity0 believes the @entity28 campaign - where they will also face @entity63 and @entity65 @entity64 - has the potential to define @entity1 's season			1
@entity1 reached the @entity28 final in 2003 after a surprise @entity18 qualifying defeat by @entity71 earlier in the season			1
the @entity74 midfielder said : ' we are still disappointed that we did n't get into the @entity18			0
@entity1 's season took an up - turn after beating @entity9 2 - 1 in the @entity8 on saturday ' we have to go out there and show we are a good team and we can play against these teams home and away			1
' when you saw the sights , there were over 200,000 @entity1 fans in @entity84 , they were saying			2
it would be great to do that again but we 're not going to get too far ahead of ourselves , we have to take it game by game and see how we do			0
' @entity84 was a huge day for the club and we 'd love to bring memories like that back again but we have to take it one game at a time and do as well as we can in the group			2
' we 've got a big squad now , new wingers and a couple of new strikers			0
they are looking good in training so hopefully they can take that into games			0
' @entity33 has live coverage of @entity28 games throughout the group stages and beyond , including @entity30 v @entity1 this thursday on @entity33 1 ( not in @entity109 )			1
