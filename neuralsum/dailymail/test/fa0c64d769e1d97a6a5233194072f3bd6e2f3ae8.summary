@entity44 and her twin sister @entity59 were among the 1,500 twins ( amounting to 3,000 children ) dr. @entity66 experimented on in @entity2 the 93 - year - old 's answer came in response to a question from attorneys representing @entity2 survivors who have joined the trial as co-plaintiffs , the dpa news agency reported			2
on wednesday @entity5 described how so many @entity3 were brought to the @entity2 death camp at once that he was put on a 24 - hour shift guarding the ramp where they disembarked from the trains			1
he told in chilling detail how cattle cars full of @entity3 were brought to the @entity2 death camp , the people stripped of their belongings and then most led directly into gas chambers			1
@entity87 charge is related to a period between may and july 1944 when around 425,000 @entity3 from @entity88 were brought to the @entity90 complex in @entity31 - occupied @entity91 and most immediately gassed to death			2
during that period , so many trains were arriving that often two would have to wait with closed doors as the first was ' processed , ' @entity5 testified at the @entity12 state court			2
though he was more regularly assigned to the camp 's @entity90 section , he said he guarded the @entity90 ramp three times , including one busy 24 - hour shift			0
the main gas chambers were located at @entity90			1
' the capacity of the gas chambers and the capacity of the crematoria were quite limited			1
someone said that 5,000 people were processed in 24 hours but i did n't verify this			0
i did n't know , ' he said			0
' for the sake of order we waited until train 1 was entirely processed and finished			0
' @entity2 survivors describe their arrival as chaotic , with @entity31 guards yelling orders , dogs barking and families being ripped apart			0
but @entity5 maintained the opposite , saying ' it was very orderly and not as strenuous ' on the ramp at @entity90			2
' the process was the same as @entity2 i. the only difference was that there were no trucks , ' he said during the second day of his trial			0
' they all walked - some in one direction some , in another direction ... to where the crematoria and gas chambers were			1
' @entity139 asked @entity5 whether he knew details about files kept at the camp in hopes of learning more about what diseases she and her sister , who both survived , were injected with survivors from @entity2 ( pictured ) , who are plaintiffs in the case , travelled from the @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity88 and elsewhere to attend @entity5 's trial between may 16 and july 11 , 1944 , @entity5 was on duty when 450,000 @entity3 were transported there , with 300,000 being gassed just after arrival			1
pictured , @entity2 survivors no pleas are entered in the @entity157 system and @entity5 said as his trial opened tuesday that he considers himself ' morally guilty , ' but it was up to the court to decide if he was legally guilty			2
he faces between three and 15 years in prison if convicted in the trial , which is scheduled through july			0
@entity44 , 81 , was one of the @entity3 who arrived at @entity2 in 1944			1
though she does n't remember @entity5 personally , she said she ca n't forget the scene			2
' everything was going very fast			0
yelling , crying , pushing ; even dogs were barking			0
i had never experienced anything that fast or that crazy in my entire life , ' she told @entity171 before addressing the court			0
her two older sisters and parents were taken directly to the gas chambers , while she and her twin sister , both 10 at the time , were ripped away from their mother to be used as human guinea pigs for notorious dr. @entity66 's experiments			1
' all i remember is her arms stretched out in despair as she was pulled away , ' @entity44 remembered			2
' i never even got to say goodbye			0
' @entity44 , who now lives in @entity183 , is one of more than 60 @entity2 survivors and their families from the @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity186 and elsewhere who have joined the trial as co-plaintiffs as allowed under @entity157 law			2
@entity2 survivor and plaintiff @entity190 ( right ) and her granddaughter @entity193 wait for the opening of the trial against @entity5 on tuesday @entity5 sits opposite @entity2 survivors @entity197 ( left ) and @entity190 ( right ) at the court room in @entity12 general view of the cout before the start of the trial against @entity203 @entity204 , who represents many co-plaintiffs , said he and his clients were happy @entity203 agreed to testify , but suspected he was withholding many details			1
' there is an ocean of truth , but with many islands of lies , ' he said			0
@entity44 , the first co-plaintiff to address the court , described her experience wednesday and asked @entity5 whether he knew @entity66 or details about files he kept in hopes of learning more about what diseases she and her sister , who both survived the camp , were injected with			1
@entity5 showed no reaction to @entity44 's statement and his attorney , @entity224 , said his client would try to answer what questions he could , but he did n't believe that @entity5 knew @entity66			1
@entity5 guarded prisoners ' baggage on the ramps , but his main task was to collect and tally money stolen from the new arrivals and then send it to @entity233 - a job for which the @entity157 press has dubbed him the ' accountant of @entity2			2
' while he previously testified he was ' horrified ' by individual atrocities he witnessed , he suggested wednesday his daily thoughts were more pedestrian , like when the guards heard a train loaded with @entity88 @entity3 would be arriving			0
' if this is @entity88 , they have bacon on board , ' he remembered thinking			0
though he was investigated twice before and no charges were brought , @entity5 was indicted under a new line of @entity157 legal reasoning that anyone who helped a death camp function can be accused of being an accessory to murder without evidence of participation in a specific crime			1
@entity5 , who worked for an insurance company after the war , has testified as a witness in other @entity31 trials			0
outside court , @entity44 said she wished @entity203 would use the trial to try and dissuade ' misguided young people ' today from becoming neo-nazis but she was still satisfied with his testimony			0
' i 'm going to take whatever confession he gives - it 's better than no confession , ' she told reporters			0
' maybe this is the best thing he has ever done in his life			0
is n't that sad ? '			0
