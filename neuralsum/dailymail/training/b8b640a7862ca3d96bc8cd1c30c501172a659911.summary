by @entity0 published : 15:30 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 16:13 est , 31 may 2013 a mugshot is perhaps the least likely beauty inspiration there is			1
but a writer at @entity5 has taken it upon herself to show readers how they can recreate the looks sported in @entity10 's six mugshots			1
from the troubled starlet 's first brush with the law in 2007 , to her most recent mugshot last year , @entity11 describes miss @entity10 's beauty evolution using herself as a model , demonstrating how she appears to have become ever - more prepared for the brutal flashbulb and harsh gray backdrop of a booking photo			1
natural look : @entity10 's first mugshot look ( left ) , taken after she was arrested for @entity23 in july 2007 , is ' almost beach - y ' , says @entity25 writer @entity11 ( right ) @entity26 and @entity28 's love child : the next mugshot , from november 2007 , sees miss @entity10 with far more make - up ( left )			1
miss @entity11 does n't rate the orange - tinted look on herself though ( right ) ' you can clearly see a progression , ' she writes			1
' in her first , she ’s a little bewildered , a little bleary - eyed			1
' by her sixth , almost six years later , she ’s totally serving it ! false eyelashes , perfectly contoured cheeks , smug brows like she ’s been there before - because she had , like five times			2
' miss @entity11 calls miss @entity10 's first mugshot look , taken after she was arrested for @entity23 in july 2007 , ' almost beach - y ' , with particular praise for the tousled hair and freckles			1
she says ' abused eye make - up ' is the way forward if one would also like to look ' upset and distraught ' , recommending a creamy pencil around the lash line			2
but to really elicit sympathy from one 's booking officer , ' tweak out on an iced red eye			1
' this would appear to mean applying powder kohl to your waterline on a moving train ' so you 'll really start to tear up ' , then removing it with a baby wipe			2
sultry gaze : in july 2010 , miss @entity10 's hair is sleeker and more groomed ( left )			1
to achieve the look , @entity65 ( right ) used @entity67 's @entity66 on pencil in the appropriately - named shade ' delinquent ' wide awake : in september 2010 's booking photo the star 's hair , albeit greasy , was back to its natural red and her skin looked clear ( left )			1
our writer ( right ) wore white eyeliner in the waterline and matte pink lips the next mugshot , from november 2007 when @entity82 , now 26 , served just 84 minutes in jail and began community service for her two dui convictions , sees her with far more make - up			1
she has a heavy layer of fake tan , black kohl around the eyes and blonder hair			0
the real @entity11 : ' i 'm actually mega attractive when i 'm not impersonating @entity10 's mugshots , ' she says miss @entity11 does n't rate the look on herself though			1
after using an orange - tinted spray foundation , she writes : ' i think i look like @entity26 and @entity28 's secret love child			1
you do n't want a tutorial anyway			0
' not much appears to have changed by the next mugshot though , in july 2010 , when miss @entity10 served 13 days at @entity103 's @entity102 jail for violating her probation			2
self - tan and eyeliner still seem to be integral to her look			0
her hair is sleeker and more groomed , however , and the eyeliner is less heavy			0
to achieve the look , miss @entity11 turned to @entity67 's @entity111 in the appropriately - named shade ' delinquent '			1
september 2010 's booking photo was taken after the actress failed a drug test and was ordered to return to jail for 30 days			2
she appealed and posted $ 300,000 bail before checking into rehab			0
in this , we saw a completely different look altogether			0
her hair , albeit greasy , was back to its natural red and her skin looked clear			0
our writer suggests caramel - tinted brows and white eyeliner in the waterline to make you look awake			0
she adds that while a matte light pink lip has ' never worked ' for her , she recommends @entity131 's @entity130 in @entity132 to get miss @entity10 's look			2
in october 2011 miss @entity10 was subject to yet another mugshot for failing to do her community service morgue duty hours			0
she was sentenced to 30 days in jail and 400 hours of community service , but spent just five hours behind bars due to overcrowding			0
the actress at this point was back to platinum blonde , her lips look swollen and her skin looks pale			0
regardless , miss @entity11 declares this look a winner because it looks ' somewhat ethereal ' and in her recreated version , she looks barely recognizable			1
@entity147 ? in october 2011 miss @entity10 was subject to yet another mugshot ( left )			0
back to platinum blonde , her lips look swollen and her skin pale			0
regardless , @entity65 ( right ) declares this look a winner back to red : in the most recent of miss @entity10 's mugshots , in march of this year ( left ) , she looks her best to date , with healthy - looking skin and her natural hair color restored			1
miss @entity11 says the look is ' so hot ' she achieves the pale skin using @entity162 's @entity161 in @entity163 , with @entity165 's @entity164 for contouring			1
for the full lips , she uses @entity168 gloss			0
it is the most recent of miss @entity10 's mugshots , in march of this year , that appears to be her most successful to date though			1
the actress , who turned herself in to police for reckless driving and lying to police , looks her best to date , with healthy - looking skin and her natural hair color restored			0
miss @entity11 , who says the look is ' so hot ' , used @entity131 's cream blush in @entity178 to recreate it , and mink false lashes			1
' i sincerely hope that i ’ll never have to recreate another @entity10 mugshot because all this self - tanner and bronzer is wrecking my complexion ' the writer acknowledges that though she addresses the subject of miss @entity10 's mugshots with humor , there is nothing amusing about being arrested			2
' i do n’t think it 's funny when anybody ’s going through a tough time			2
it sucks to be arrested ! ' she writes			0
' i ’m looking forward to [ @entity10 ] completing treatment and getting back on the grind			0
' nor , she insists , does she really look like @entity82 in real life and in fact ' i 'm actually mega attractive when i 'm not impersonating @entity10 's mugshots			2
' she admits though , that @entity82 has the edge when it comes to mugshots , as she can neither pull off a full face of make - up so well , nor can her skin handle it			0
' in reality , @entity10 is great at taking mugshots because she ’s beautiful			0
[ but ] i sincerely hope that i ’ll never have to recreate another @entity10 mugshot because all this self - tanner and bronzer is wrecking my complexion			0

@entity11 charts the troubled starlet 's beauty evolution , from her ' bewildered ' yet ' beachy ' look in 2007 to her more polished appearance of march this year
