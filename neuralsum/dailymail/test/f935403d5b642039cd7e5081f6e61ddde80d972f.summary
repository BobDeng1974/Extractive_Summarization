@entity2 cricket 's new broom swept dramatically through the national team on wednesday night when @entity4 paid the price for their woeful @entity6 by being sacked as managing director			1
the move came a day ahead of an @entity11 board meeting that was meant to discuss the future of a figure who has endured a traumatic time since replacing @entity16 in the aftermath of the @entity18 whitewash			1
with more sackings inevitable , @entity19 asks : who 's next ? @entity22 @entity4 was a supporter of @entity22 as @entity24 captain but was persuaded to sack him as one - day captain three weeks before the disastrous @entity6 campaign			1
the new ‘ director of @entity11 cricket ’ might think @entity22 needs to go back to scoring runs at the top of the order after failing to convince as a tactician			0
@entity22 was sacked as one - day captain three weeks before the disastrous @entity6 campaign @entity33 an atrocious @entity6 heaped even more pressure on the coach , whose reappointment last year by @entity4 has been mitigated only by last summer ’s @entity38 win against @entity39			1
described as ‘ the outstanding coach of his generation ’ by @entity4 , @entity33 ’ position is now as weak as it has been			0
@entity4 has left his role as managing director of @entity11 @entity46 it is almost inconceivable that barely six months after publishing one of the most vitriolic books in the history of sport , this high - maintenance player could be on the brink of a return			2
but @entity4 ’s removal , and @entity57 ’s departure , means the path is now clear for @entity46 if he scores runs for @entity60			0
@entity46 has rejoined @entity60 in the hope of earning a place in the @entity18 squad for @entity11 this summer @entity64 the chairman of selectors and former @entity68 captain has been involved in one of the grimmest periods in @entity2 cricket			0
selections have been difficult to fathom at times and a series of well - publicised clangers have alienated the selector from players , spectators and media			0
verdict : sure to follow @entity4 out the door the chairman of selectors @entity64 ( left ) looks sure to follow @entity4 through the exit door			2

@entity4 became the latest *casualty* of @entity11 's poor *performances*
his exit came a day ahead of an @entity11 board meeting into his future
he endured a traumatic time after replacing @entity16 after the ashes
@entity4 's exit is not expected to be the last following poor @entity6
