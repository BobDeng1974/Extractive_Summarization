a breakthrough at @entity11 has created a @entity13 - style vehicle that can ' swim ' through a patient 's veins , powered wirelessly by electromagnetic waves from doctors from outside			1
previous prototypes have been hampered by large batteries - but the new machine is around the size of a grain of rice			1
a transmitter outside the body sends electromagnetic waves which induce power in a coil in the 3mm device , which then powers a motor that propels it through the body @entity33 in the classic 1966 sci fi @entity13 : the film envisaged a team of surgeons being ' shrunk ' to fit inside the body the device could deliver drugs , perform surgery , or just take on ' reconnaissance missions ' which would otherwise require invasive endoscope treatments			1
the current prototype chip is only three millimeters wide and four millimeters long			1
this week , at the @entity45 , professor @entity44 demonstrated a tiny , wirelessly powered , self - propelled medical device capable of controlled motion through blood			1
' such devices could revolutionize medical technology , ' said @entity51			0
' applications include everything from diagnostics to minimally invasive surgeries			0
' @entity51 's most recent creation , could travel through the bloodstream to deliver drugs , perform analyses , and perhaps even zap blood clots or remove plaque from sclerotic arteries			2
the idea of implantable medical devices is not new , but most of today 's implements are challenged by the size of their batteries , which are large and heavy and must be replaced periodically			0
fully half the volume of most of these devices is consumed by battery			0
an induced current provides the power - which keeps the device small enough to ' swim ' through the bloodstream the chip is so tiny it can swim through blood vessels , controlled by electromagnetic waves from outside the body @entity82 's team hope that their discovery could revolutionise treatment of illnesses that are currently resistant to surgery ' while we have gotten very good at shrinking electronic and mechanical components of implants , energy storage has lagged in the move to miniaturize , ' said co-author @entity92 , a professor of electrical engineering and computer science			1
' this hinders us in where we can place implants within the body and also creates the risk of corrosion or broken wires , not to mention replacing aging batteries			2
' @entity51 's devices are different			0
they consist of a radio transmitter outside the body sending signals inside the body to an independent device that picks up the signal with an antenna of coiled wire			2
the transmitter and the antennae are magnetically coupled such that any change in current flow in the transmitter produces a voltage in the other wire â€“ or , more accurately , it induces a voltage			0
the power is transferred wirelessly			0
it can be used to run electronics on the device and propel it through the bloodstream .			0

3mm chip can ' swim ' through blood vessels
powered by electromagnetic waves from outside the body
