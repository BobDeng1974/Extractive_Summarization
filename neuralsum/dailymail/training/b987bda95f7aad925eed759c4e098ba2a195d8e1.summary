by @entity0 follow @ @ charlieskillen while fans around the world were glued to their screens to watch the @entity6 final – not to mention 65,000 packed into the @entity7 do @entity8 , i had a day with a difference			1
i flew out to @entity10 to the @entity11 , and watched the game with @entity14 hero @entity13 and former @entity16 star @entity15			1
legends on either side of the @entity14 divide , the two former champions league - winners were bound to have different takes on the @entity22 showpiece			2
all smiles : @entity24 caught up with @entity13 ( left ) and @entity15 ( right ) in @entity10 during last week 's @entity6 final after appearing the night before at a beach dinner for hundreds of competition winners , @entity15 and @entity13 showed off their skills by shooting into a floating goal in the @entity30 , aided by some truly impressive jetskiing skills			1
after proving that i ’m better off writing about football than playing it with a spot of beach soccer , i caught up with the two stars to gauge their nerves before the game			0
@entity13 was predictably hell - bent on @entity14 securing the famous ‘ @entity43 ’ – their tenth @entity6 – while @entity15 was quietly confident @entity16 could do the double over their illustrious neighbours by following up winning @entity41 in spectacular fashion and winning the @entity6			1
former striker @entity13 left you under no illusion who he thought the bigger team was , saying : ' @entity43 is not life or death , but it 's the most important thing for the club , the city and the supporters			1
' it 's the biggest competition in @entity57 and @entity14 are the most important club in the world , so it 's a necessity			2
big match : former @entity14 striker @entity13 and @entity62 answered questions as @entity14 finally achieved @entity43 ' @entity64 will play the same way he has done all season			1
a team like @entity14 does n't have to change their strategy because of the opposition			2
’ @entity15 , meanwhile , was a little less bullish , but believed the pressure was all on @entity64 ’s side , while revealing he would love to know @entity16 boss @entity73 ’s secret formula			1
' i would like to be inside the dressing room to know how he 's handled everything , ’ he said			0
‘ it 's been very difficult fighting against @entity14 and @entity79 and @entity16 was always there			1
he 's done an amazing job			0
' man to man @entity14 is stronger , but that 's not the most important thing in a final			2
everyone knows how important the 10th @entity57 cup is to @entity14 so @entity16 know if they win they can be at the top for a few years			1
' back of the net : the two @entity14 legends warm up at the @entity91 after a healthy dose of after - sun in the hotel , i went to the cinema - style open - air viewing for the match , where excitement to watch the final was already reaching fever pitch			0
@entity13 and @entity15 smiled and waved on stage to the audience , before settling in to their main task for the evening – answering fans ’ questions on @entity106 throughout the match , including some from @entity24			1
i spoke to both of the players before , during and after the game , with one much happier as time progressed than his counterpart			0
throughout the ninety minutes @entity13 looked glum , in stark comparision to his fellow @entity115 – sure of seeing his former side complete the ultimate double over their arch nemesis			0
question time : the duo claimed @entity120 was experienced while @entity121 was very talented that all changed with @entity124 ’ goal deep into added time			0
@entity13 jumped up , knowing that @entity64 ’s side had grasped the chance of a glorious win from the jaws defeat			0
extra-time was horrifically cruel to @entity16 , who had been superb throughout normal time			0
@entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 put the score at a truly unfair 4 - 1			0
with @entity13 still celebrating , i managed to grab a few words with the despondent @entity15			2
he said : ‘ @entity16 did a great job , but because they made a mistake they got punished – that ’s what @entity14 do			1
in the end it was a bit unfair , but that ’s football			0
‘ @entity16 deserved to win			0
they played the same as they have done all season , keeping real away from the goal , and it worked for 90 minutes – but you ca n’t make those mistakes			0
‘ @entity73 has to be immensely proud of the whole season			2
’ while @entity15 contemplated the loss and @entity13 grinned away watching his club finally lifting ‘ @entity43 ’ , i was whisked off to the neighbouring @entity155 opening party			1
@entity13 and @entity15 attended # sharethesofa for @entity11 ’s @entity157			2

@entity13 and @entity15 spoke to @entity24 during @entity14 's @entity6 *victory* against rivals @entity16
@entity13 *insisted* @entity43 was n't life or death but was important for @entity14 fans
@entity15 claims @entity73 has done an *incredible* job against @entity79 and @entity14 this season
