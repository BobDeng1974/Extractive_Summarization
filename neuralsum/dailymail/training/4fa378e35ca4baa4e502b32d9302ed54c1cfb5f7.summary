what is this wonder ingredient ? no , not some fancy foreign oil but plain old beef dripping @entity4 says it ’s the secret of his rich and moist fruit cake			1
@entity7 uses it in her classic lasagne			1
@entity10 swears by it for ‘ perfect ’ roast potatoes			1
and @entity13 fries his fish and chips in it at his restaurant in @entity18			1
so what is this wonder ingredient ? no , not some fancy foreign oil but plain old beef dripping			0
this wartime staple is returning to @entity23 tables thanks to new research that suggests fat is an essential part of our diet and that we should be consuming it instead of refined carbohydrates and sugar			2
the many endorsements by culinary experts are helping , too			0
this year , gourmet butcher @entity33 won a prestigious @entity34 — described as the @entity35 of the food world — for the dripping he makes from @entity39 and @entity40 beef , beating more than 10,000 recipes for other far more exotic dishes			0
since then , @entity43 has seen its @entity39 dripping ( 99p for 200g ) fly off the shelves			0
i remember eating dripping in my grandmother ’s kitchen in @entity50 in the @entity51			2
back then , it was a treat for us children			0
before that , in the @entity56 , it was a staple of school lunches			0
but the diet and fat - conscious @entity60 and @entity61 saw dripping and other fats fall out of favour — the enemy of aerobicised waistlines			2
modern research , however , is recognising fat as an essential part of our diet — needed to protect organs and aid the absorption of vitamins			2
and according to many scientists , we are probably better consuming animal fats like butter and dripping			2
there ’s evidence , for instance , that the @entity81 polyunsaturated fat found in margarines made from sunflower oil can lead to inflammation of the arteries and trigger heart disease			1
when it comes to dripping , it has more calories than butter ( 889 per 100g compared with 717 ) and the same amount of saturated fat ( 51 per cent ) but by virtue of its much stronger flavour , far less is required			1
so while you may slather butter on your bread , half a teaspoon of dripping on a slice is easily enough to flavour it wonderfully			1
it has more calories than butter ( 889 per 100g compared with 717 ) and the same amount of saturated fat ( 51 per cent ) but by virtue of its much stronger flavour , far less is required the dripping typically sold in supermarkets contains 23 per cent monounsaturates — the kind of fat in olive and rapeseed oils — and 62 per cent polyunsaturates , found in ‘ healthy ’ sunflower and soya oils			1
and it has none of the ‘ trans ’ fats known to increase cholesterol levels			1
crucially , it contains no sugar or additives either , unlike other spreads such as jam and peanut butter			2
fashionable restaurants such as the @entity123 in @entity124 are making their own dripping by slowly rendering down beef fat , then refining it to a creamy white texture before serving			2
@entity128 is also being used in the more distinguished gastro pubs — for cooking @entity131 puddings and enriching the flavour of toad in the hole			0
and at @entity4 ’s restaurant in @entity137 , @entity131 , you can even get a dessert of panna cotta with roasted rhubarb and dripping cake			1
@entity7 uses it in her classic lasagne also making a comeback are lard — pork fat — and suet ( the fat surrounding the kidneys and loins of cows and sheep )			1
@entity153 was once such a key part of our diet that the very place we store our food — the larder — was named after it			0
among its fans is @entity162 , who makes delightful @entity164 buttermilk pancakes with lard , served with maple syrup			0
meanwhile , suet is part of the gourmet sausage revival , being added with the rest of the meat before binding			0
dr @entity171 , the nutritionist on @entity173 ’s @entity172 , says : ‘ now that we know sugar and refined carbohydrates are worse for us than we thought , it ’s a good time to reassess the old - fashioned foods we have dismissed			1
‘ we need fats to help our bodies absorb vital vitamins , including vitamin a , which helps the digestive system , vitamin d for bone growth , vitamin e , which aids the immune system , and vitamin k , which helps blood to clot			0
‘ we ’ve got in the habit of ladling jam on to white bread and butter			1
but a slice of delicious bread , such as sourdough , with a dab of beef dripping could be healthier			0
’ yet as i prepare to take a bite of dripping on bread — my first for decades — i ’m still unsure			0
can it really taste as good as my usual treat of toast and @entity205 strawberry jam ? i need n’t have worried — my childhood delight at its taste floods back			0
the dripping is the consistency of clotted cream , with a delicate meaty smell			0
just a tiny spoonful gives all the flavour of sunday roast on toast			1

it has more calories than butter ( 889 per 100g compared with 717 )
but it has same amount of saturated fat
and by virtue of its much stronger flavour , far less is required
