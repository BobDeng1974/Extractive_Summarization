by @entity0 published : 16:29 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 05:32 est , 6 november 2013 they already have a car that drives itself in the pipeline			0
and now developers at @entity5 are hoping to make life on the road even easier - with drivers able to open the windows or turn on the air con with a wave of a hand			1
the internet giant is working on a new system that will effectively do away with complicated buttons and dials on a car 's dashboard			1
new technology : first the driver-less car ( pictured ) , and now @entity5 is developing a system of hand gestures to turn on car lights and wind down windows in a bid to replace many of the buttons found on car dashboards give us a wave : an image submitted as part of the @entity5 patent showing the typical sort of gesture that might be performed by motorists using the new technology instead a range of the vehicle 's functions will be controlled by simple hand gestures detected by in - car cameras			1
both @entity5 and car manufacturer @entity40 has separately applied to patent the technology that will allow motorists and passengers to lower and raise the window with a swipe gesture , turn on windscreen wipers and indicators with a flick of the fingers or open the sunroof just by pointing at it			1
the idea is drawing comparisons with the control system in the 2054 - model @entity56 driven by @entity59 's character in the 2002 futuristic film @entity61			0
according to the @entity63 , @entity5 's patent claims that the technology will be more useful in cars where the driver still has to drive , rather than alongside its self - drive system			1
they say that it will stop drivers becoming distracted by gizmos and gadgets in the car while at the wheel			1
thing of the past ? the new technology could do away with the sometimes complicated dashboard controls found in most cars ( file picture ) according to the @entity63 , their patent said : ' while a user is manoeuvring a vehicle , the user may wish to perform a number of additional functions , such as navigating to a destination , changing the temperature in the vehicle , or changing the volume of music playing in the vehicle			1
' the user may perform a gesture in a region of the vehicle			0
example regions include a steering wheel , an air - conditioning vent , and an ear of the user			1
' the predetermined gestures may include , for example , any gesture that an occupant of the vehicle may make with his or her hands , fingers , arms , legs and head			2
' gestures will be recognised by a 3d camera in the car and can be confirmed using a voice function			0
as well as basic dashboard settings , the system could also be used to change cruise control speed or to alter the position of one of the car 's seats			2
@entity40 's proposed technology would use a similar camera operated recognition system			0
the car manufacturer 's patent application says that drivers can confirm commands by a simple thumbs up or thumbs down gesture			2
last year @entity135 showcased a gesture control system at the @entity137			0
@entity5 has been testing its self - driving cars on roads around @entity140 and @entity141 since 2010 and claims that they are safer than cars driven by professional drivers			2
the firm is said to be considering how to market the car			0
new age : the concept has already drawn comparisons with the futuristic @entity56 model driven by @entity59 's character in the 2002 film @entity61 life imitates art : @entity59 pictured in action in minority report			0
some of the controls of his car in the film could be activated using gesture recognition technology			0

commands will include opening sunroofs and turning on air conditioning
the technology will do away with dashboard dials , buttons and *levers*
@entity5 says it will stop drivers becoming distracted at the wheel
both *companies* are *attempting* to patent the @entity177 technology
