families are to foot the bill for @entity3 ’s decision to pay £ 4.2billion for @entity5 football rights after the firm sneaked out an inflation - busting price rise on @entity8			1
the firm is putting up the price of its family bundle of channels by nine per cent or £ 3 a month to £ 36 , or £ 432 a year			1
the bundle does not even include its sports channels , which means those who have no interest in football are subsidising @entity3 ’s deal to show @entity5 games			1
film fans will also be hit with a 50p a month increase in the cost of the @entity36 package and some £ 1.50 a month more for the combination of movies and sport			2
critics say the price rises appear to be an attempt to recoup the huge sum that will be paid to super rich clubs like @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
@entity3 paid £ 4.2 billion to show 126 live @entity5 matches a season from 2016 to 2019			1
that equates to £ 11m per game , which is up by 66per cent compared to the current tv deal			0
analysts suggested the tv giant overpaid for the football rights in order to fend off competition from @entity59 and others , however it is clear that the pain is now being passed to viewers , whether they like sport or not			1
when the deal was announced , the @entity5 ’s chief executive , @entity64 , heralded it as a success story for the nation ’s biggest and richest clubs			2
however , it is viewers who will be funding the @entity71 , @entity72 and £ 200,000 a week contracts of the likes of @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , and @entity78			0
the company , which has more than 11m customers in the @entity81 , bid about £ 300m a year more than analysts had expected in february ’s auction			2
at the time @entity85 , @entity3 ’s chief executive , said the bill would largely be financed by cost cuts , however , he hinted that price rises would be necessary			1
@entity3 suggested its customers would not have to foot the bill for the record @entity5 tv deal this graphic charts the significant rise of domestic @entity5 tv revenue from 1992 until 2019 the timing of the announcement appears designed to limit media coverage			1
details appeared on the firm ’s website on wednesday , when the nation ’s attention was focused on @entity104			0
attempts to reach @entity3 spokesmen were frustrated by the fact most were at the @entity109 premiere of the new season of tv fantasy drama , @entity112			2
normally , @entity3 would announce any price rise in september , however making the announcement then would have coincided with its loss of the tv rights for the @entity117 to @entity59			1
it would have been obvious to viewers that they were being asked to pay more for less			0
the inflation - busting increases will come into effect on june 1 and coincide with the middle of the latest series of @entity112			0
fans will effectively have to agree to the higher subscription			0
@entity3 last increased prices in september with the figure for its sports bundle going up by six per cent			2
that meant the price of its sports package had risen about 30 per cent above inflation since 2001			0
the fact it is putting up prices yet again could well drive millions of people to switch to the likes of @entity136 and @entity137 , both of which cost less than £ 7 a month			2
viewer reaction to the news was hostile			0
one contributor to the @entity143 website wrote : ‘ hey @entity3 , i do n’t care if you overpaid @entity5 , i ’m not paying for something i did n’t buy			1
’ critics claim the price rises mean viewers will be funding the @entity71 , @entity72 and £ 200,000 a week contracts of the likes of @entity45 's @entity75 ( left ) and @entity47 's @entity76 ( right ) @entity77 ( left ) and @entity45 's @entity78 ( right ) are among the other highest paid @entity5 players another , wrote : ‘ if only @entity112 was available elsewhere i could cancel ...			1
surely the sports option itself should pay for the bid ? ’ a third questioned the rises for the non-sport packages			0
he wrote : ‘ so wait , they ’re increasing their prices to cover @entity5 costs , yet the sports package is the one that ’s increasing least ? way to show your audience who ’s important ! ’ another said : ‘ i think it ’s time i dump my @entity3 subscription			1
there is now so much competition in the market i can get the same content elsewhere			0
’ @entity174 has complained to the tv regulator @entity175 about the way @entity5 rights are sold to broadcasters , claiming it leads to expensive subscriptions which do not even provide live coverage of every game			1
spokesman , @entity183 , said : ‘ too many people feel they now have to choose between basic essentials and watching the game they love			0
if action is not taken to change the way the @entity5 sells tv rights , the rapidly rising cost of watching football at home will see even more people priced out of the national sport			1
’ @entity3 offered a bizarre explanation for the timing of the announcement , claiming it was necessary to comply with regulations imposed by the @entity201			2
in fact , the @entity201 has absolutely no role in the timing of such announcements			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we work hard to make @entity3 the best value entertainment choice for subscribers			0
on average , bills will rise by less than £ 3 per month			0

@entity3 is putting up the price of its family bundle of channels to £ 432 a year
it comes after @entity3 's £ 4.2billion payout for @entity5 football rights
also putting up price of @entity221 by £ 1 a month making it £ 564 a year
critics say rises appear to be attempt to recoup sum paid for football rights
