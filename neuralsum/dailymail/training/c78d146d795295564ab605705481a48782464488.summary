a forward - thinking @entity10 fashion designer has used complex sensory technology to create a dress that moves , changes shape and even lights up when it is looked at			1
@entity15 - based designer @entity14 installed her high - fashion creations with eye - tracking technology so that they activate when they sense someone 's gaze			1
they are sewn with photoluminescent thread and contain tiny eye - tracking electronic devices			0
the gaze - activated dresses have small motors sewn into them that can move parts of the dress and make them change shape			2
sensory technology is used to transform the garments from pale , ethereal dresses into luminescent art works that resemble jellyfish			2
tendrils : the ivory pieces of ruched super-organza are engineered to react by moving and lighting up			0
the dress has tiny motors sewn into it @entity60 : @entity14 said she was recreating strands of @entity62 ( left ) and jellyfish ( right ) in her conceptual artwork @entity14 explained the concept to @entity66 : ' we use an eye - tracking system so the dresses move when a spectator is staring , she said			2
' [ the system ] can also turn off the lights , then the dresses illuminate			0
' @entity14 said she was inspired by an essay by @entity75 and told @entity76 it is , ' about speed , light and disappearance , so while creating these dresses , i must have unconsciously related to it as the movement of jellyfish			0
' @entity84 : the intricately - designed creation is made from super-organza and weighs around half a pound interactive : @entity14 's series of reactive garments include a leather coat ( left ) and layered cape ( right ) that move when light is shone on them ' whether it is a direct visual contact or through a camera , the artistic concept of gaze has always appealed to me			1
therefore , when my robotics designer @entity101 and i started working on the project , we thought a lot about how to bring both the conceptual and technological level together , ' @entity14 explained to a @entity76 reporter .			0

@entity15 - based designer @entity14 used sensory technology in her dresses
the interactive clothes react to a *onlooker* 's gaze by moving and lighting up
dresses made from super-organza and sewn with glow - in - the - dark thread
