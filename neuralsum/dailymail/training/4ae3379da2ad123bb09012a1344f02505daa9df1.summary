when @entity1 sent models sporting piles of colourful hair accessories down the catwalk during their s / @entity7 show , the fashion world swooned in delight			1
but the designers ' source of inspiration for the look is an unlikely one - the colourful @entity14 people of @entity16 's @entity15 , who like nothing better than intricate piles of brightly coloured hair clips			1
and they are n't the only ones who love a good hair accessory			0
ever the early adopters , @entity26 's @entity25 girls have enthusiastically embraced the look , although their colour of choice is pink in all its shades			1
pretty : a pair of @entity26 @entity25 girls show off their collection of hair clips - all in varying shades of pink @entity38 : the @entity14 tribe of @entity16 's @entity15 have long adored colourful hair clips but wear theirs differently to the @entity25 girls by contrast , the @entity14 use them to clip their fringes in place , choosing striking rows of clips in alternate bright shades or , in some cases , in shimmering blocks of silver			1
in @entity26 , pink is most popular , whether bright fuchsia or delicate powder shades - all perfectly in keeping with the @entity56 ' sub-set which sees women pile on as many frills , bows and ruffles as they can			2
clips are worn dotted across fringes , combined with girly bunches or worn clipped on to candy - striped headbands			0
@entity66 pattern and @entity68 designs are also loved			0
the creative use of accessories will come as no surprise to anyone who has followed @entity26 's adventures in fashion , with the country producing a fascinating range of style tribes			2
girly : along with every shade of pink imaginable , @entity26 's @entity25 girls like delicate patterns , whether floral , polka dot or candy - striped style tribe : this girl has combined elements of the @entity25 look with sporty stripes and a chic neon pink scarf pile it high : never knowingly underdressed , these girls have added piles of necklaces , headbands and glasses to their colourful look keeping it simple : this fashionista has opted for a darker take on the trend , opting for white and silver bows , as well as a pair of pink hairbands @entity105 : this bright ensemble is lifted by the addition of a mini crown - something also seen at @entity1 among the most creative of all is the hair clips ' most devoted group of admirers , the @entity25 style tribe which sees girls - and some boys - dressing to show off their individuality with takes on the look ranging from the @entity56 ( sweet and girly ) to @entity118 ( @entity119 )			1
the antithesis of fake - tanned hair - extensioned @entity132 chic , @entity25 girls like pink , kitsch , tutus , delicate dabs of glitter , enormous false lashes , ultra pale skin - and plenty of hair clips			1
the most common @entity25 style is named the ' classic @entity134 ' , which despite referencing the @entity136 novel in the name , has nothing to do with looking sexy and everything to do with achieving a look that is as cute , girlish and pretty as possible			0
based on frilled and furbelowed @entity144 styles combined with a hint of goth , girls hope to achieve a porcelain - doll look using lashings of lace , ribbon , bows , ruffles , bloomers , aprons , and ruffled petticoats			0
then there 's the ' @entity134 ' look			0
featuring even more ribbons , bows , and lace , than the ' @entity134 ' , it leaves out the gothic elements in favour of pastels			0
mixing it up : like @entity26 's fashionistas , the @entity14 are fond of mixing up their hair clips with piles of jewellery - including head bands good look : bright hair clips are not a female - only trend for the @entity14 as this boy ( left ) demonstrates			1
bright sunglasses are also popular intricate : this man has used red and blue hair clips to keep his fringe in place and has accessorised the whole thing with a feather matching : this colourful pair have opted for a similar colour scheme , matching striped shirts and bright beaded arm bands @entity184 is also popular and involves giant bow headdresses or bonnets , teamed with lighter , less extreme make - up			2
for the @entity14 , getting dressed is less about showing individuality and more about looking as bright and cheerful as possible			0
beadwork has long been part of their culture , with many opting for colourful beaded headbands - sometimes combined with the hair clips			2
others , regardless of sex and age , adorn themselves with piles of arm bands , heavy metal necklaces and beaded belts in eye - popping shades of yellow and crimson			0
however they are worn , piles of colourful hair clips have proved one of the most universally popular trends of 2014 , with devotees also spotted at @entity211 in the summer and at festivals across the globe			1
and with scores of colourful hair accessories cropping up on the @entity217 , it is probably just a matter of time before they show up on a high street near you			1
more is more : this lady has combined no less than three clusters of hair clips with huge beaded earrings , a lariat and a head band beautiful : as this photo reveals , her simple t - shirt is almost hidden by her beaded belt and breast plate and she also carries an umbrella mix and match : head bands are n't the only way to brighten up a look			2
headscarves and bold earrings also go well with the piles of clips			0

@entity26 's @entity25 girls and @entity16 's @entity14 tribe share a love for piles of colourful hair clips
in @entity252 , clips are worn on fringes alone with the *majority* choosing girly shades of pink and lilac
the @entity14 take a bolder approach with beautiful block colours and intricate patterns *reigning* *supreme*
bold hair accessories are a big s / @entity7 trend , with @entity1 among designers to show them
