by @entity0 @entity1 : @entity2 has allegedly said comments on air that are considered deeply offensive to @entity5 a firebrand @entity7 cleric is being allowed to broadcast hate sermons to the @entity10 from a pretty @entity12 village because the regulator @entity13 is powerless to act			1
sheikh @entity14 , 34 , is accused of stirring up bitter sectarian tensions in the @entity7 world via his @entity18 - licensed satellite channel , which is based in a former @entity20 church hall in a leafy corner of @entity22			1
his station , @entity24 , is required to comply with @entity13 ’s strict rules banning hate speech for any programmes that can be watched by @entity18 or @entity29 viewers			1
but the communications regulator can place no restrictions on what he broadcasts to the rest of the world because this is out of its jurisdiction			1
@entity2 , who belongs to the minority @entity37 branch of @entity5 , has allegedly made remarks on air that are considered deeply offensive to the rival @entity5 sect			1
he was granted asylum in @entity18 in 2004 after being jailed in his native @entity42 for insulting some of the most revered figures for @entity5			1
tensions between the two branches of @entity5 are at the root of much of the bloodshed that has plagued the @entity10 for centuries , right up to the current conflict in @entity50			1
an mp warned that problems between @entity5 and @entity37 would also ‘ bubble up ’ in @entity18 unless action was taken to stamp out hate speech aired with impunity from the @entity18			1
last year @entity2 led a campaign that raised £ 2 million to buy a former evangelical @entity20 retreat in the idyllic village of @entity60 in the @entity22 commuter belt			2
the large hall has been turned into a mosque that also houses @entity64 , which is broadcast across the world by different satellites			0
in a recent programme , @entity2 was filmed cutting a cake to celebrate the death of one of the most important historical figures in @entity5 , the @entity67 reported			2
the radical cleric also allegedly said : ‘ stay away from @entity37 , or the hand that helps fund those in @entity50 , we will cut it off , and i know what i mean			0
’ @entity79 , the @entity80 mp for @entity81 , said @entity2 had also claimed on air that two male early @entity7 leaders who are revered by @entity5 had a sexual relationship together			1
broadcasting from leafy @entity22 but only to the @entity10 , he can not be stopped by @entity13 , which only has the power to place restrictions on stations playing to @entity18 and @entity29 listeners @entity13 is investigating whether any of these remarks were broadcast to @entity18 viewers			1
a second satellite tv channel , @entity91 , based in north - west @entity92 , which is targeted at @entity94 ’s @entity5 minority , is accused of transmitting a programme in which a presenter called @entity37 clerics ‘ devils ’ and accused them of stealing from @entity100			1
this station is not licensed by @entity13			2
mr @entity79 described the material being aired on @entity64 as ‘ ten times worse ’ than the sections of @entity105 ’s novel @entity106 that led to the @entity18 author facing death threats			2
he added : ‘ if somebody was being anti-semitic , we would take action			0
if somebody was being racist we would take action – even if it was an @entity115 person having a go at a black person			0
and it ’s quite right to do that			0
‘ because this is seen as intra-faith , nobody seems to be bothered			0
it is already causing problems in the @entity124 and the @entity10			0
it will start to bubble up here as well			0
’ the mp called on @entity13 to stamp out sectarian hate speech , and said that the regulator should if necessary be given more powers and resources to investigate foreign - language channels broadcast from the @entity18			1
' because this is seen as intra-faith , nobody seems to be bothered			0
it is already causing problems in the @entity124 and the @entity10			0
' - @entity79 mp ‘ we have got to put a stop to it , and it ’s the responsibility of @entity13 to do that			2
if they ca n’t deal with it , then the police should step in , ’ he said			0
@entity13 investigated @entity64 in 2012 after @entity2 broadcast a sermon in which he questioned the sexuality of a @entity5 successor to the @entity146			1
but the regulator concluded that there had been no breach of its broadcasting code and issued the station with ‘ formal guidance ’			0
an @entity13 spokesman said yesterday : ‘ @entity13 has strict rules forbidding the broadcast of hate speech on tv and we take this extremely seriously			2
when channels break these rules , we take robust action and have recently fined broadcasters			0
‘ we are examining the allegations made against @entity157 , and if it is breaking our rules then we will act swiftly			0
‘ while people in the @entity18 can watch programmes on the internet or on satellite from around the world , @entity13 has jurisdiction to investigate and take action when a channel is licensed to broadcast in the @entity18			1
‘ if individuals are preaching hate in the @entity18 , this is a criminal act and should be reported to the police			2
’ @entity2 could not be contacted yesterday , but he declined to comment when approached by the @entity67 .			0
