by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ as the clock ticks down on @entity5 ’s time with @entity6 , the duel to secure his signature increasingly appears to be a straight foot - race between @entity9 and @entity10 to sign up the electric @entity12 forward			1
after a glittering performance at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity5 holds all the cards as he deliberates over his future			1
here , @entity18 assesses all that he needs to know ahead of making the life - changing decision			0
the sign in the tunnel tells the players ‘ @entity61 ’ but on those special @entity52 nights , they need no reminder , as the pillars and rafters of this famous stadium shake and the songs , chants and banners cascade down from all sides			0
long overdue development plans are set to take place in the near future to expand the stadium towards a 60,000 all - seater capacity			0
in the corporate complex that is the @entity69 , you can often be left feeling impressed by the infrastructure but cold by the atmosphere and it may continue to be that way as long as prices remain high , altering the demographic and cutting off the supply to the every - day football fan			0

@entity10 may have won more @entity113 , but for heritage and global reputation , @entity9 , whose @entity52 trophy haul surpasses @entity118 and @entity6 , are only matched by @entity83 in @entity43 football			1

@entity10 may have fallen behind their rivals but they maintained the aesthetic beauty that so characterised the performances of @entity145 ’s finest teams and this is recognised on the continent			2
footballers know that they will invariably improve under the parental qualities of @entity145 , who has three @entity119 titles and @entity113 on his cv in @entity43 football			0
in @entity163 , however , @entity145 has competition			0
the @entity165 has emerged as one of @entity52 ’s brightest minds , working under @entity168 , and altering the landscape of @entity171 football by transporting @entity172 into @entity173 at @entity174 before restoring @entity9 into a title - challenging force with tactical intelligence and motivational methods			2
this summer , as @entity163 is tasking with rebuilding his squad as @entity180 heads out of the exit door , will go some way to indicating the strength of his powers of persuasion , with high - end stars a necessity to replace the troublesome @entity188			0
@entity10 : @entity189 : 7/10 @entity145 age : @entity191 : @entity192 , @entity193 over : @entity194 : games 1,010 @entity196 with @entity10 : @entity119 1997 - 98 , 2001 - 02 , 2003 - 2004 ; @entity141 1998 , 202 , 2003 , 2005 , 2014 ; @entity197 / @entity123 1998 , 1999 , 2002 , 2004 @entity163 age : @entity199 : @entity200 , @entity201 over : @entity202 : games 97 @entity204 with @entity9 : none yet aura : @entity145 still has the ability to attract the biggest names to the @entity69 rising star : @entity163 has all the attributes to be a successful manager , as shown by @entity9 's tilt at the @entity119 title last season @entity213 the @entity10 @entity215 feed has just under 4million followers , compared to @entity9 attracting just 2.86m			1
evidently , @entity10 ’s global reach has been amplified by success in the 1990 ’s and the early part of the 2000 ’s , during the explosion of globalisation as the @entity222 club tapped into the commercial opportunities available			2
@entity9 remain a huge attraction , particularly in the @entity226 and @entity227 but @entity145 ’s invincibles captured the imagination in the @entity230 , and the club eclipsed @entity83 as the most popular in @entity231 , according to surveys earlier this year			0
@entity10 ’s domestic support may not compare to @entity9 ’s more visceral , passionate following but the commercial incentives available to @entity5 may be greater if he is to be based in @entity222			1
@entity10 : @entity189 : 7/10 global reach : @entity10 fans in @entity237 , @entity227 , during one of the club 's pre-season tours capturing the imagination : @entity9 fans at the @entity243 during a pre-season friendly training ground as with all elite clubs these days , both @entity9 and @entity10 boast immaculate , top - of - the - range facilities , from gymnasiums and specifically designed synthetic pitches to swimming pools and high - end rehabilitation rooms			1
while @entity9 ’s training base has been there since the days of @entity253 , @entity10 ’s was only developed in the late 1990 ’s , on the specific request of @entity145 , who was determined to elevate standards at @entity10			1
partially funded by the proceeds of @entity258 ’s transfer to @entity259 , @entity10 invested millions in a brand new plush training centre at @entity261 , even being used by the @entity43 national team on several occasions			0
@entity10 : @entity264 : 7/10 training base : @entity145 , @entity266 and @entity267 at the club 's @entity261 training base headquarters : @entity9 are put through their paces at @entity272 chance of success @entity9 are without a league title for 24 years , since the days when it was simply called @entity120 before the @entity119 swept into town			1
@entity10 had gone nine years without a single trophy before their @entity141 success in may			0
the odds of silverware do not seem too favourable at either destination but both these clubs may feel that the last campaign could act as a kick - start for something special to take place			0
nonetheless , with @entity289 , @entity83 and @entity290 all strengthening in the transfer market , it would represent a major surprise if either @entity9 or @entity10 emerged as title winners next season , while @entity52 success would appear to be some way off for both sides			2
@entity10 : @entity298 : 6/10 total - arsenal : 46/60 @entity9 : 44/60			2

@entity29 star @entity5 is likely to leave @entity6 this summer after @entity14
@entity10 and @entity9 are among clubs *interested* in the forward
both view @entity5 signing as a real *statement* of intent
