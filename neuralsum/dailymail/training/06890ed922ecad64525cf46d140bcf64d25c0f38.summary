after being inspired by these views as she travelled the world , art director @entity6 has collected satellite shots of global airports from @entity12 's @entity11 to @entity15 's @entity14 airport			1
the images reveal the complex beauty of these sprawling behemoths , and in the same way flights keep cities connected , the airports resemble connections in the human body - from muscles to nerves			1

the images reveal the complex beauty of these sprawling behemoths and as flights keep cities connected , the airports resemble connections in the human body			1
for example , this aerial shot of @entity40 airport looks like muscles stretched over a skeleton @entity6 wrote on her blog : ‘ i ’ve been fascinated by airports for as long as i can remember - there ’s something about the comings and goings , the organisation and operation that ’s so intriguing to me			1
‘ i ’ve always lived in a direct flight pattern of an airport			2
