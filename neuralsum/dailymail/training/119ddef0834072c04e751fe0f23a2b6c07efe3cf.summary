@entity0 are drawing up a ' long list ' of potential new managers to replace @entity3 in the summer			1
the latest name on that list is former @entity7 and @entity8 boss @entity6			1
other names include @entity10 of @entity11 , @entity12 , currently managing in the @entity13 , @entity16 ’s @entity15 and @entity17 boss @entity14			1
@entity0 look set to replace manager @entity3 this summer with fans less than happy in east @entity19 @entity12 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) are just two names from a long list of potential successors the club ’s official line is that they will wait until the end of the season to decide on @entity3 ’s future when his contract expires			1
@entity29 revealed in the autumn that would be the case even when there were then suggestions that a new deal would be struck given how well the @entity0 had started the season			1
but that was never going to happen			0
@entity3 's position was under threat at the start of the campaign			2
and indeed had @entity0 started the season on current form - just three wins in 12 ( two of those in the @entity45 , including a penalty shoot - out against @entity47 ) ahead of sunday 's match with @entity49 - he would have been sacked			1
the last eight @entity51 games have seen one win , four draws and three defeats			2
i understand the board have come to the conclusion that while overall @entity3 has done a good job in leading the club back to the @entity51 and keeping it there the time has come for a new stimulus			1
the 4 - 0 defeat at the hands of @entity64 in the @entity45 could be the straw that broke the camel 's back last week ’s 4 - 0 humiliation at @entity64 in their @entity45 fifth round exit will likely be seen , on reflection in the summer , as the straw that broke the camel ’s back			1
and given that next season is the last at the @entity74 i understand the club feel a new dimension is required most likely from a foreign coach to get the results and play the sort of football that will attract new fans to fill the @entity82 when they move in , in 2017			1
the club have looked admiringly at the impact that @entity85 has made at @entity86 which is why fellow @entity87 , who has been out of top level coaching since leaving @entity89 in 2013 , could be seen as a wise choice			0
the situation could come to a head sooner if @entity94 part ways with @entity95 , who was on @entity0 ’s radar last summer and could yet be a candidate			1
@entity3 would be an obvious target for @entity94 if that job becomes vacant			2
but @entity3 may well seek a job abroad if as seems most likely he leaves the @entity0 in the summer			1
@entity85 ( r ) has impressed at @entity86 and the @entity0 may look at @entity6 as a similar mould @entity95 is under pressure at @entity94 and @entity3 and the @entity103 could swap places @entity105 is being groomed as a potential successor to @entity107			1
earlier this month @entity108 revealed that @entity105 had started taking his coaching badges which would lead to a role working at @entity112 training hq initially with younger players			2
@entity107 confirmed that to be the last case last week			2
there is a belief amongst the @entity118 hierarchy that with some coaching experience under his belt including moving up to help with the first team @entity105 could quickly acquire the right attributes to become a top manager despite lacking experience			1
former @entity118 captain @entity105 has taken up a coaching role and could be set for more in the future @entity118 look as to how @entity128 returned to @entity8 after his playing career ended , working as b team coach before taking over from @entity6 after one year			1
in that sense a time table that could see legendary @entity132 striker @entity105 take over at the start of the 2017 - 18 season is possible			1
it remains to be seen though how the rest of the season unfolds			0
current @entity140 coach @entity139 , backed up by former @entity132 @entity141 and @entity142 remains an option should the club wish to move in another direction			0
since his retirement , @entity105 has been working as a television pundit for @entity148 @entity149 has been touted as a summer target for @entity118 in a £ 64million deal from @entity152 to make way for the @entity155 club signing @entity156 from @entity157			1
however , @entity158 are considering making a move for the @entity103 striker and it would be major shift in policy if @entity118 paid that sort of fee and the £ 250,000 - a - week wages @entity149 would want			1
@entity149 has been touted as a summer target for @entity118 should @entity152 sign @entity156 @entity168 has come onto @entity157 ’s radar in what promises to be another summer of big spending for @entity172			1
the @entity174 striker joined @entity175 from @entity176 on a free transfer last summer			1
eleven goals in 28 games has not been a bad return but the word in @entity182 is that he has n’t really settled in under @entity128			0
it seems certain @entity157 wo n’t exercise their option to sign @entity186 on a permanent basis and @entity168 would be in ideal addition to bolster their front line especially if he comes on the market around the £ 30 million bracket			2
@entity175 striker @entity168 ( left ) is a summer transfer target for @entity157 i am hearing @entity158 will battle @entity152 for @entity49 ’s £ 25m - rated goalkeeper @entity194 in the summer			1
i am also hearing @entity196 could be sold by @entity0 in the summer , that is if he can prove his fitness to another club			1
the club ’s hierarchy have grown weary of @entity196 ’s terrible injury record since making him their record singing at £ 15m 18 months ago following a season ’s loan at the club from @entity207 i hear @entity208 , who sold @entity196 to @entity207 for £ 35m , would be willing to take him back but offer as little as £ 8 million plus appearance bolt ons			1
@entity196 , sideline to the end of the season with a knee injury , would also have to consider a wage cut			1
with the likelyhood that @entity3 , who has so much belief in the player , will be gone , the club would be ready to get the erratic @entity221 centre forward off their books @entity196 injured his knee but stayed on the pitch after @entity0 had made all three of their substitutions @entity196 has posted a picture of his bandaged and swollen knee on his official @entity229 account @entity230 @entity232 ’s new manager @entity231 spoke impressively when questioned about the events on the @entity234 last week			1
as one of the few black bosses in @entity238 football and who , as a player , started out in the early @entity241 when racism was rife , @entity231 , 52 , was better qualified than most to take a view on the situation			0
he went out of his way to stress that those guilty of the abuse were not real @entity249 supporters and the club itself should not be held responsible even if they had a duty to take the action of banning the fans from @entity255			0
what @entity231 wants to see is the authorities in @entity155 and @entity221 take the lead in rounding up the bigots			0
@entity231 spoke out his experiences with racism during his time in football @entity231 stressed it was a social issue which he said has improved markedly over the course of time … with football often leading the way			0
but he warned racism lurks hidden and disguised , often in places where on the face of it all the right anti-racists noises are made but behind closed doors			0
which is why the authorities must show the will to pursue the suspects with vigour			0
the depth and power of @entity231 ’s words suggested he has the mental strength to succeed as a top - flight manager			2
he certainly has the technical credentials having earned his stripes on merit after a playing career was cut short by injury , working with the @entity45 , @entity290 and most recently developing talent at @entity49			2
in many ways it was the emergence of black players as heroes to kids of all races , players like @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , that helped push racists to the edges of the football world			0
a new wave of black managers can only help the cause further			0
so i just hope things go well for @entity231 at @entity232 and he shows he can handle to pressures of being a top - flight boss as well as he handled last week ’s press conference			0
and who knows if he does , then in a few years ’ time @entity231 could become the @entity221 national team ’s first black manager			0
btw : it was good to catch up with @entity320 on the phone last week about the reunion he had with some @entity324 stars last week			0
the former @entity221 winger was particularly delighted to see @entity326 at the function			0
@entity326 is now 79 but it was great to hear @entity320 report that the former @entity221 right back and skipper before @entity330 was in good shape			0
@entity326 ( right ) leads out the @entity221 team as @entity333 leads out the @entity334 @entity320 met up with some of his ex-blackpool team - mates at a reunion i recalled a conversation i had with @entity326 some years ago when @entity339 was breaking through into the @entity221 team			0
@entity326 felt that @entity221 could actually get the best out of him , and @entity341 , by playing @entity339 as playmaker at right back or wing back			0
‘ really ? ’ , i questioned			0
@entity326 went on to point out the brilliance of @entity345 as @entity346 right back and captain in 1970 and then @entity348 who won two @entity349 in 1994 and 2002			0
@entity326 continued that sometimes in international football the only space to exploit is when coming deep from the flanks and that players must adapt from their club positions to impose themselves in the national side			0
as @entity320 said , such thinking out of the box is what is often needed to make an international team full of individual stars , winners			0
sadly in @entity221 it ’s not since the days of @entity362 that there has been a manger prepared to do so			0
@entity365 last season @entity0 beat @entity49 three times , twice in the league then at @entity369 in the @entity370			1
spurs beat the @entity0 on the opening day of the season and it hard not to see a @entity49 win at home			2
coral quote 5/6 , the draw is 13/5 , while a @entity0 win 7/2			2
@entity376 ( left ) scores during @entity0 's 3 - 0 win against @entity49 at @entity369 in october 2013 not surprisingly @entity378 is 7/2 to score the first goal			2
but @entity380 at 8 - 1 might be worth a tickle if the @entity0 start on front foot			2
a possible treble today then is a @entity49 win , with both @entity47 vs @entity383 and @entity86 vs @entity207 to end up as draws .			0

@entity0 boss @entity3 has been *criticised* by fans this season
the @entity0 are eighth in the @entity51 but are out of the @entity45
@entity6 , @entity12 and @entity15 all being considered
@entity118 legend @entity105 could succeed manager @entity107
@entity158 *interested* in a summer move for @entity152 striker @entity149
@entity172 is keen on @entity175 forward @entity168
@entity196 could leave @entity0 this summer if he can *regain* fitness
