@entity0 does not seem to be a big fan of today 's young pop stars			1
the legendary @entity4 singer , who found fame as one half of the internationally acclaimed group the @entity8 alongside @entity9 , was asked in a recent interview to further explain comments she made earlier this year that @entity12 was not a ' feminist , ' but rather a ' feminist lite			1
' and @entity0 did not hold back			1
' it 's not - it 's not liberating , it 's not empowering			0
it 's a sexual thing that you 're doing on a stage ; it does n't empower you			0
that 's my feeling about it			0
' in addition to @entity12 , twerking has been a big part of musical artists like @entity44 and @entity47 ' recent stage and music video performances			1
in the interview , with @entity25 's @entity49 , the singer also broke down just what her problem is with pop music these days			1
' the reason why i 've commented is because i think that this overt sexuality thrust -- literally -- at particular audiences , when very often performers have a very , very young audience , like 7 years older , i find it disturbing and i think its exploitative			2
i 'm coming from a perspective of a woman that 's had children , ' she explained			0
sorry girls : in addition to @entity12 ( left ) another famed twerker is singer @entity44 ( right ) queen : of course , the biggest twerker of all is @entity47 ( seen above performing with @entity70 at the 2013 @entity71 ) this whole debate began when @entity0 was asked what she thought about the 33 - year - old labeling herself a feminist while on stage at the @entity71 back in august			1
' i just love her performances - but i 'd like to sit down [ with her ]			0
i think i 'd like to sit down with quite a few artists and talk to them			0
i 'd like to listen to them ; i 'd like to hear what they truly think , ' @entity0 said at the time to pride source			2
@entity0 also seems to be well aware of how polarizing her opinion on the subject is , telling @entity49 at the end of their interview , ' maybe this is a good thing because it creates debate			2
' the singer was on the program to promote her new album , @entity95 .			0

@entity0 has *responded* to recent comments she made about @entity12 , saying that the singer was not a ' feminist ' but rather ' feminist lite '
the legendary @entity4 singer told @entity25 that ' twerking is not feminism '
she went on to say she finds *modern* music today ' disturbing ' and ' exploitative '
