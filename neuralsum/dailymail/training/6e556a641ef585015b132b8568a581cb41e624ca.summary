we 've all been there			0
you 've walked out the door , gotten in the car , then promptly realized you 've forgotten your phone			2
much to everyone else 's annoyance , you head back inside to get it			0
at least we are all in good company : now president @entity10 has had the same memory failure too			0
on his way to @entity13 to promote his immigration executive actions , @entity10 boarded his @entity16 helicopter on the @entity18 's @entity17			1
but he promptly disembarked and headed back into the executive mansion			0
when he emerged moments later , the president said he had forgotten his @entity30 , pulling it from its holster and showing it to reporters and photographers			1
but an @entity37 photographer captured a curious thing when @entity10 first got out of the helicopter : his @entity30 was already in its @entity40 does he have two phones and had lifted the wrong one ? or had he forgotten something else which he was n't willing to disclose			1
phone lover : @entity10 is the first president who is a slave to his smartphone			1
his @entity30 has been either in his hands - or a belt holster - since he was running for president			1
addict : mr @entity10 refused to give up his @entity30 when he entered the @entity18 and is the first president to use a smartphone to read emails either way , the president 's love of his smartphone is well known			1
when he entered the @entity18 he had to give up the @entity30 which he had carried throughout his campaign , in exchange for one whose security had been upgraded by the @entity58			1
it is hardly a normal model : as well as being heavily encrypted , it can only communicate with 10 people , so that his conversations remain private - for now - and documented for the future			0
currently there is a review under way of communications for the @entity18			2
analysts are assessing whether the executive should move to use a different operating system , meaning the president could have an @entity74 or @entity75 phone			0
however the review is unlikely to be completed and new contracts awarded until 2017			0
mr @entity10 's use of a @entity30 makes him a rarity as the company 's presence in the market has fallen dramatically since being outpaced by first @entity75 and then the @entity74 operating systems			0
@entity83 has become the biggest - selling smartphone with its @entity74 ranges .			2

president was on the way to @entity13 to promote immigration *amnesty* when he got off @entity16 as it stood on the @entity17
signalled to his team that he was going back to the @entity18
said that he had forgotten his *blackberry* as he returned to the helicopter
but was carrying a smartphone when he got on first time - so what really *happened* ?
