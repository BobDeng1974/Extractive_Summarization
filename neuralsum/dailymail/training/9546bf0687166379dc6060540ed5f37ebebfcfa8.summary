by @entity0 published : 04:34 est , 23 may 2012 updated : 11:34 est , 23 may 2012 stone tablets hidden in the museum of @entity4 's archives may contain a terrible , ancient curse calling a devil - goddess to bind and torment a named victim			1
the tablets were hidden in the archives for nearly a century - thought to have been put aside at the start of @entity11 - and rediscovered in 2009			1
the tablets are believed to be 1600 years old			0
now a translation has revealed the dark purpose of the slabs - calling a snake - shrouded figure to ' bind ' a man who is mummified with his hands tied			1
he is named as ' @entity21			0
' the tablet calls a snake - shrouded devil - goddess to ' bind ' a mummified man - the victim is named as ' @entity21 ' @entity26 : the @entity4 ' @entity27 ' is unusual because of its mixture of terrifying demonic figures and text - and , @entity31 , says , could invoke the ' three - formed ' goddess @entity32 , often seen as the ' mother ' of witches diagram : @entity31 , of the @entity36 has interpreted the strange tablets for the first time @entity31 , of the @entity36 has translated the strange tablets for the first time			1
' in the foreground is a standing barefoot figure , with crossed or tied hands at belly height			0
on hischest are a magic sign while in the genital area is an eight - pointed star , ' she says			2
' sinuous snakes emerge threateningly from the side of his crowned head			0
below , lying down , mummified and with his hands tied , or at least crossed , is the victim of the curse , perfectly recognisable because of the inscription running down both arms , which reads : @entity56			2
' carving curses into tablets was a common practice in the ancient world - with lead tablets used in some areas , and stone in others			2
the @entity4 ' @entity27 ' is unusual because of its mixture of terrifying demonic figures and text - and , @entity31 , says , could invoke the ' three - formed ' goddess @entity32 , often seen as the ' mother ' of witches			1
the first figure , with snakes streaming out of his / her head , and a crown is thought to be the demon - or goddess - who is being called on to carry out the curse			1
' the deity of the @entity4 curse is barefoot and has a magic sign on the breast - and also has an eight - point star in its genital area , ' says @entity31			1
the star is almost unique - but other features such as the snakes make an identification with the @entity26 tempting			0
the film ' @entity26 , @entity91 ' : the goddess is often seen as the ' mother ' of all witches the curse tablets were lost in the archives of the museum of @entity4 for nearly a century @entity26 - the witch - goddess - is often invoked in curse tablets			1
' while it is tempting to identify this figure with this deity , the absence of other characteristics , such as her three forms or her bearing torches , as traditionally associated with her , undermines this hypothesis , ' says @entity31			0
interestingly , the images seem to show both the goddess - or demon - and the victim as being bound , tied up , or mummified			2
the ' spell ' is binding @entity26 - or another demon - to torment @entity112 , whoever he may have been			0
â€˜ just as the deity is bound , so will @entity113 be , ' says @entity31 .			0
