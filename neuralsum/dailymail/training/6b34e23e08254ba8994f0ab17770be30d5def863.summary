the judge who sentenced @entity2 grandmother @entity1 to death for drug - smuggling has died unexpectedly at the age of 55			1
@entity6 , a senior official in @entity8 , was known to be extremely keen on the death penalty - meaning that @entity1 could have escaped with a lesser punishment if her trial had been delayed			1
he was found dead at his home on friday after suffering a suspected heart attack , three months after sentenced the @entity15 to be executed by firing squad			1
therefore , if @entity1 's trial had not taken place until after his death , she would probably have received a more lenient sentence from a different judge			1
just three days before his death , mr @entity34 told @entity35 that his decision to ignore the 15 - year prison sentence recommended by the prosecution was based on the evidence against the 56 - year - old @entity2 woman			2
' she was trying to smuggle a lot of drugs into @entity8 , ' he said of the 11lb of cocaine she was caught with at the airport			2
' i thought that the sentence was appropriate with what she had done			2
' drug smuggling is a crime that has a huge impact on the people here in our country			0
that 's why i committed to give a heavy sentence to any drug smuggler			0
' distraught : the @entity2 grandmother wept after she was sentenced in a court in @entity8 in january three other @entity2 who @entity1 said were involved in the smuggling attempt received sentences ranging from just one year to six years			1
she said at the weekend that she would prefer to be shot sooner rather than wait for many months as her appeal process drags on			0
during his long career on the bench , the judge delivered numerous controversial death sentences and issued many severe verdicts			0
last november , he served on a panel of judges that issued a surprise ruling which sentenced to death a husband and wife for the murder of their employers			0
smuggling : @entity1 was caught with 11lb of cocaine at the local airport in may last year while serving in @entity82 between 2004 and 2008 he handed down his first death sentence after finding a man guilty of murdering a son of a local @entity87 leader			1
the father of four lived alone at the @entity8 court 's housing complex while his wife and children continued to live in the city of @entity94			2
police said initial investigations following the discovery of the judge 's body in his home had failed to find any evidence of foul play			0
his family are understood to have refused a full autopsy .			0

@entity6 gave @entity1 death sentence in january
found dead from ' heart attack ' aged 55 at @entity8 home on friday
if her trial had been delayed until now she could have *lighter* sentence
