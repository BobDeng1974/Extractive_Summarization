by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 - squire published : 17:00 est , 11 january 2014 updated : 21:36 est , 11 january 2014 one of @entity5 ’s best - loved animal charities is today accused of putting profits before pet welfare after making swingeing cuts to services despite receiving a record income			0
@entity11 receives £ 62 million a year in donations from caring animal lovers and investment profits – yet a @entity16 investigation has revealed that it has slashed spending on frontline services by more than £ 3 million			1
the cuts include closing seven centres because they were helping ‘ too many ’ cats , and reining back on its crucial neutering programme , resulting in 17,000 fewer stray and rescued animals being helped			1
vulnerable : @entity11 has made cutbacks on vital services including vaccines yet pays its chief executive more than £ 100,000 a year , according to an investigation by the @entity16 ( file photo ) despite the cuts , @entity11 increased its spending on staff to more than £ 12 million a year – including more than £ 100,000 on wages for its chief executive – even though it is run largely by an army of 8,500 unpaid volunteers			1
now some of those volunteers have come forward to accuse bosses of ‘ betraying ’ the millions of people who make donations			2
major : @entity11 is one of @entity5 's largest animal charities , receiving £ 62 million a year the whistleblowers , who have now left the charity , also revealed how : ‘ it is no longer about rescuing as many cats as possible , it has become about cutting as many costs as possible , ’ said former volunteer @entity47			1
@entity11 , which has more than 250 branches , says its ‘ vision is a world where every cat is treated with kindness and an understanding of its needs ’ , with neutering and rehoming its two main objectives			1
but former volunteers have been left dismayed by cuts			0
one of the areas to be hardest hit is the neutering of cats – even though the charity itself has warned that the @entity5 is being overrun by an unprecedented number of strays , as owners ca n’t afford to neuter their animals or care for their litters			1
whistleblowers said cats were put down instead of having vets ' bills paid - a claim the charity denied ( file photo ) ' appalling ' : @entity78 said her branch in @entity80 , @entity81 , had been chipped away at until it closed completely in october as managers cut back on vaccines			1
she now runs a cat charity from her home a female cat can produce 18 kittens in a year and can end up with 20,000 descendants in just five years			1
however , the number of cats neutered by the charity fell by 20,000 in 2012			0
@entity78 told how administrators chipped away at funding for her branch in @entity80 , until they closed it for good in october			0
she said her branch had requested £ 9,000 for neutering in 2013 , based on the number of cats brought in the previous year , but had been given only £ 1,600			0
cute : this cat was one of several helped by @entity78 , who has blown the whistle on @entity11 she said : ‘ it ’s appalling the way they treat the volunteers by cutting back , irrespective of the effects on the animals			1
’ she also revealed the cuts to the vaccination programme , saying : ‘ in february 2013 , they recommended we use cheaper vaccines and give the cats an injection which did n’t cover them against all the diseases , such as respiratory infection			2
i could n’t believe they would be willing to put the cats ’ health at risk for a small saving			1
’ but a spokesman from @entity11 was adamant that ‘ all cats in our care must receive a minimum veterinary standard of care , with most receiving more ’			1
mrs @entity78 also spoke out against the decision to cut back visits before rehoming strays			0
‘ it ’s disgraceful ’ , she said			0
‘ how can you tell over the phone if people are lying or not , or whether they are suitable owners ? ’ fellow former volunteer @entity134 was left ‘ devastated ’ when her @entity136 branch was axed in november 2012 after 23 years			0
‘ it felt like a kick in the teeth , ’ she said			0
‘ it felt like @entity11 were prioritising cost over the care of the cats			2
’ she also accused the charity of targeting their branch for closure because they had requested £ 12,000 to pay for neutering that year			2
‘ they said we should n’t have been neutering so many cats and that we were helping too many people , which was now unaffordable			0
so they were closing us down			0
how can they justify paying themselves such high salaries while shutting the centres where the real work is carried out ? it was just easier for them to shut us down than fight to keep us open			2
we helped thousands of stray cats every year – where will they go now ? ’ @entity159 : one animal which was put up for rehoming by @entity11			1
the charity 's income is £ 62m a year other branches that have been shut in the past two years include @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 in @entity171 and @entity172			2
while @entity11 – formerly known as the @entity11 claim the cuts are not ‘ adversely affecting our care of cats ’ , figures show that the charity helped 17,000 fewer cats in 2012 than in 2011			1
controversy : another one of the thousands of pets rehomed through @entity11 another volunteer , who spoke on condition of anonymity , accused ‘ heartless ’ @entity11 of putting down cats unnecessarily			1
‘ when i was working for them i was fostering a lot of cats and they said they would take a couple off my hands and rehome them			0
‘ i stupidly believed them			0
one of them was a six - month old kitten and they ended up putting her down			0
they said she was too frightened on her own in the pen			0
but they did n’t make any efforts to help her			0
in my opinion it was just easier and cheaper for them to get rid of her			0
‘ they also wanted us to put down any cats that were over ten years old , ’ added the former volunteer			2
‘ and if blood tests revealed the cats had any diseases , regardless of age , we had to put them down too , rather than pay a vet to cure them			2
’ however , @entity11 deny the claim and say they ‘ never put a healthy cat to sleep ’ and put down sick cats only on vets ’ advice			1
the charity admitted they had cut back their neutering budget following ‘ overspends ’ in previous years , but said the budget rose again last year			0
it also admitted no longer carrying out home visits for every rehoming , but pointed out : ‘ since we ’ve reduced the number of home visits the number of cats returned to us has not increased			1
’ @entity11 chief executive @entity235 added : ‘ in an organisation as large as ours , there are bound to be one or two who are unhappy with things			1

@entity11 whistleblower : volunteers laid off and seven centres shut
it has 8,500 unpaid workers but chief executive on more than £ 100,000
vaccinations ' have been reduced for the sake of saving £ 2 per cat '
charity has **allegedly** put down some cats rather than paying vets ' fees
@entity259 deny the claim , saying they ' never put a healthy cat to sleep '
vaccine payments have been reduced , so cats are no longer *immunised* against *bacterial* infection , saving £ 2 a time but putting animals at increased risk .
staff and volunteers are now told not to visit *properties* where rescue cats are being rehomed – except in ‘ *exceptional* ’ circumstances .
@entity11 has **allegedly** put down sick cats , rather than paying vets ’ fees .
