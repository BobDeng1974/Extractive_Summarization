the former account , 32 , battled monsoons , searing heat , paralysing headwinds , accidents and terrifying traffic on lawless highways during his staggering trip around the globe			1
with little more than his bike , a tent and a camera , intrepid mr @entity2 cycled through @entity20 , @entity21 , the @entity22 and @entity23 before heading home through @entity24 and the @entity25 and back into @entity20			1
he told @entity60 : ' @entity23 was really tough for me			2
one the one hand it was a really incredible experience			2
the poeple are so gracious and they will help you in every possible way			2
' but on the other hand , you go to the most remote villages , where they 've never seen a white guy before			0
i found myself standing in the middle of this street , mobbed by 200 people , who are just pointing and staring at you			0
' one night i found what i thought was the most perfect place , grassy lawn overlooking a lake			0
i put my tent down , it was in the middle of monsoon season and the storm erupted over my head			1
' it was at that moment the waters started to rise and i started to smell an unpleasant odour			0
the next morning i realised i 'd pitched my tent in the middle of the village latrine			0
' all four corners : the 20,000 mile cycle ride took mr @entity2 from @entity5 through @entity20 , @entity21 , the @entity22 , @entity23 before heading home through @entity24 and the @entity25 and back into @entity20 @entity94 - trotting : @entity2 , pictured in @entity95 , has just arrived in @entity5 after completing a staggering 20,000 round the world cycle ride spirit of adventure : @entity2 chronicled the outward part of his journey between @entity54 and @entity55 , february 2013 all smiles : a rather more disheveled looking is still in good spirits as he travels through @entity23 he added : ' for me the challenge is very marginally physical			1
i think most people , with a little training could do it			0
the real hardship is the mental side , the monotony , the loneliness			0
' but i think one of the key things i 'd love people to take from this is if he can do it so can i. ' mr @entity2 , from @entity5 - who is no stranger to extraordinary adventures having previously summited @entity119 - said there were only a few times he feared for his life			1
but during one leg of his journey across @entity125 , he felt at his most vulnerable as he endured countless close - calls while cycling along a treacherous highway			1
he said : ' there was no guardrail , it was single lane with juggernauts thundering along			1
it was n't just the vehicles behind that you had to worry about , it was the cars and lorries overtaking and heading straight at you which you also had to watch out for			0
' making friends : former financial services worker @entity2 makes some new friends during a brief stop in in @entity144 , @entity145 long road ahead : mr @entity2 cycled more than 20,000 miles around the world , through @entity148 and @entity145 , on his bike the terrifying @entity150 lasted 700 kilometers and took mr @entity2 several days to negotiate - mirracously without major incident			1
he added : ' there was no other way across @entity125			0
i had to take that road			0
i even thought about doing it at night when there was less traffic			0
but looking back , that would have been suicidal			0

on his last @entity167 update , mr @entity2 said : ' perfect weather on the home run into @entity5 yesterday and this adventure comes to an end			1
it has been such an incredible journey and the support i have had has boosted me in the lows and motivated me during the highs			2

he wrote : ' final few days on the approach to @entity211			0
some of the most difficult headwinds i have faced and long 100 miles days			0
' another entry adds : ' the monsoon hits ! with rising water levels it quickly got to the point where it was only me sitting in the tent that was stopping it being washed away , a very wet night			2

120 degree heat , suffocating humidity , tornadoes , torrential rain , paralysing headwinds , vast deserts , breathtaking canyons but most importantly countless new friends			2
flooding : @entity2 was caught in torrential downpours while in @entity23 storm clouds : adventurer @entity2 had to cope with dreadful weather - including monsoon storms , with only his tent as shelter ' you are my inspiration and i could not have achieved this otherwise			1
an incredible 4,500 mile cycle from @entity265 to @entity266 , the wrong way around ! ' fourteen punctures , two new chains , a new rear wheel and cassette , an upgraded saddle and the most awesome tiger tan lines from my sandals and riding gloves			2

i 've met the most amazing people and been witness to the most amazing stories			0
' every single day has been a huge adventure			2
more than the physical exhaustion of it has been the emotional exhaustion of every day finding somewhere to sleep and something to eat â€“ the slow accumulation of daily survival			0
