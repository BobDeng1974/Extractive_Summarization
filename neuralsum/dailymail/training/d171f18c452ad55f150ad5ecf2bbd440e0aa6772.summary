by @entity1 reporter published : 17:18 est , 12 september 2012 updated : 08:05 est , 13 september 2012 some of the world 's earliest colour movies have finally been shown to the public 120 years after they were shot having been painstakingly restored by film archivists			1
the obscure film segments , which give a never seen before glimpse of the @entity9 age , were long considered to be failed prototypes and had been consigned to an archive			1
but after recording the footage digitally , workers at the @entity13 in @entity14 were able to unlock remarkably modern - looking images created more than a century ago			1
scroll down to see some of the colour footage the way we were : one of the earliest known colour films in existence shows horse - drawn carriages near @entity23 , in @entity24 in 1902			1
the footage was painstakingly restored by archivists at @entity13 in the @entity14 the scenes , screened at the @entity28 , ranged from roughly 5 to 40 seconds and showed a parrot , a @entity24 street scene , and three smiling children sitting around a table covered with a burgundy cloth batting at a goldfish bowl with large sunflowers			1
' no one really has seen it until more or less today , ' said @entity38 , the @entity39 's curator of cinematography			0
' look at the age of it			0
here you 've actually got color film from the early edwardian period			2
' he said he hoped the movies would change people 's perceptions of ' what was possible back then			0

after transferring the footage to digital workers at the @entity13 in @entity14 were able to unlock remarkably modern - looking images created more than a century ago the film is slightly jerky but of decent quality			1
with the exception of the kids ' frilly turn - of - the - century clothes and some mild discoloration , the sun - drenched clip of children playing might have been something shot by a baby boomer in his or her back yard with a 1970s @entity77 camera			2
experts have dated the movie segments back to 1901 or 1902 , when cinema was still in its infancy and inventors on both sides of the @entity84 were racing to produce ever - more realistic films			1
@entity87 inventor @entity86 led the way with peep - show - like @entity89 ; the @entity91 had wowed @entity93 audiences with moving images projected onto screens in 1895			0
the next challenge was to shoot a film in color			2
that was no mean feat. working in @entity24 , inventor - photographer @entity100 devised a complex , three - color process which would shoot black - and - white negatives through red , green and blue filters alternating in rapid succession			1
@entity105 : negative scans from two reels of the early film			2
archivists were able to restore the footage after transferring it to digital storage the idea was to project three differently filtered frames at a time on to a screen to create the illusion of a single , colorful @entity118 theory , anyway			0
in practice the timing of the filters and distance from the screen had to be perfectly calibrated or the movie became ' a horrible mess , ' according to @entity126 , the curator of silent film at the @entity129 's @entity128			0
@entity100 never quite got the hang of the process , and when he died of a heart attack in 1903 his footage was passed on to @entity87 film entrepreneur , @entity134 , who partnered with film pioneer @entity135 to develop a modified ( and much more successful ) system , dubbed @entity137 , in 1906			0
@entity38 said that @entity134 donated @entity100 's footage to the @entity28 in 1937 , where it stayed until about four years ago , when it was sent to the @entity13			2
experts digitized the footage , finally allowing it to be shown			0
labour of love : @entity38 , curator of cinematography at the @entity13 , @entity14 , with the old projector and some of the earliest colour film light fantastic : a blueprint for the @entity152 projector dating from 1899 @entity126 noted that earlier films had been colored artificially - sometimes by painting right onto the black - and - white film - but said that the movies displayed wednesday were ' the first natural working color film in the world			1
' film historian @entity158 said in an email that he was excited not by the technology or what he described as the ' firstism issue , ' but by what he said might be called ' the drive to beauty in the early inventors of cinema			0
' ' they saw from the start that cinema could make you gasp at the beauty of a fish or a sunflower , ' he said .			0
