by @entity0 trial : alleged blackmailer @entity2 , 31 , arriving at @entity4 this week a celebrity who has received several death threats and demands for money was ' genuinely fearful ' when an alleged blackmailer threatened to reveal ' extremely embarrassing ' information , a court heard today			1
the star , identified only as @entity13 , said he reported concerns to police so often that they would have built up a ' massive file '			1
but he said the alleged threat by 31 - year - old security worker @entity2 , from @entity18 , @entity19 , gave him a ' mini heart attack '			1
the star , whose identity is protected by a court order , told @entity4 : ' i have had death threats , i have had all sorts of threats			1
' i have had similar things happen with people saying they are going to do things like this in the past ... the police will have a massive file '			1
' i panicked and went to ground ... it gave me a mini heart attack and i felt like i was drowning			1
' i did not know what to do			0
i sought advice and was told to wait until the person played their hand			2
' i wanted to know more and see what his hand was			0
i genuinely believed this information would destroy me			0
' this person was absolutely threatening me - beyond a shadow of a doubt ... it was like waving a gun around			0
these are genuine fears and concerns			0
' i ’m genuinely fearful of the ramifications of what could happen here			0
' @entity13 previously said he was ' petrified ' the ' deeply personal ' details would be made public and said he was filled with ' fear ' and ' panic ' when he learned of @entity2 ’s alleged intentions			1
the celebrity added : ' at first i thought it could be a wind - up but it caused me some alarm			2
