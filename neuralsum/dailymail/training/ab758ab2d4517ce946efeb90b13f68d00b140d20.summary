professor @entity1 's son @entity0 , 14 , suffered a shattered cheekbone playing rugby when the phone rang at work , that wednesday afternoon 11 years ago , i thought it would be a routine call			1
instead , i got the news no mother ever wants to hear : my elder son , @entity0 , then just 14 , was in hospital , badly injured			1
he had been hurt while he should have been safe at school , playing a rugby match			1
feeling sick , i rushed to be by his side			2
he had a shattered cheekbone , caused by contact with another player ’s knee			1
his face looked distorted and his eye socket was hanging down			2
he was in a lot of pain and he could n’t eat or drink except through a straw			0
in addition , he was concussed and disoriented			0
the surgeon said his injury was equivalent to that suffered by someone going through a car windscreen			1
as a mother , naturally i was horrified , but seeing his battered form stirred another thought , equally disturbing			0
i am a public health doctor — professor of public health research and policy at @entity35			1
how common , i wondered , were such injuries in children ? and how dangerous a sport was rugby ? should it be something that children are forced to play at school ? after all , it was n’t the first time @entity0 had been injured playing rugby			1
a year earlier , he ’d broken his leg , with the long - term result that he still has to wear a special insole in his shoe			1
and at just eight years old , he ’d broken his nose			1
when he broke his leg and cheekbone we were living in @entity52 , and i thought of all the young boys and teenagers i saw in plaster on the streets , and hobbling up and down the school drive			1
most of all , i thought of my old friend , a fellow doctor , who was injured in a rugby match aged 24 , leaving him paralysed from the neck down			1
now , after a decade of research into the risks of playing rugby at school , i have published a book for parents : tackling @entity68 , what every parent should know about injuries			1
@entity68 is a very dangerous game , which should not be compulsory in any @entity74 school , says professor @entity1 what i discovered while writing it was both shocking and extremely worrying , and it led me to the conclusion that rugby is a very dangerous game , which should not be compulsory in any @entity74 school			1
according to the @entity83 , there are 1,900 rugby union clubs in @entity85 , with 362,319 pre-teen male players and 698,803 teen male players — 1,061,122 in total			1
school rugby injuries can be severe			2
at the more minor end are bruises and sprains			0
then there are more serious injuries : fractures , torn ligaments , dislocated shoulders			0
most serious of all are the concussions , the spinal cord and head injuries			0
@entity102 , 14 , from @entity103 , @entity104 , died in 2011 after he collapsed on the pitch then there are the fatalities : children like @entity102 , 14 , from @entity103 , @entity104 , who died in 2011 after he collapsed on the pitch			1
even though he had suffered a concussion following a collision , he played on for 25 minutes			2
a second blow to the head killed him			0
during my research , i found that there is a culture of letting boys play on with a concussion , despite the fact that it can leave them brain damaged , and can prove lethal			0
earlier this year a court heard how @entity124 from @entity125 , became disabled after playing a school match despite having concussion			2
but even though such serious injuries do occur on school rugby pitches , i learned that nobody in the @entity74 is collecting data about them			2
rugby injuries are under - reported and badly - reported , usually not reported at all			2
@entity135 departments no longer collect data on the cause of injuries — the government stopped funding it			0
how can we prevent injuries if we do n’t know what they are or how often they occur ? schools and all the @entity146 should be collating this data			0
so , as part of my research , i undertook a pilot study of six schools in @entity52 in 2009			0
i found that over the course of a season , the average risk of injury to a player is 17 per cent , or one in six , and in other studies , in some schools it is as high as one in three			0
in our small study , in just 193 matches there were 37 injuries			0
of these , 20 required @entity135 attendance , and 65 per cent prevented further participation in the sport for three weeks or more			0
if you knew your child was taking this big a risk , would you still want them to play rugby ? my son @entity0 stopped playing rugby for ever after his third injury			1
i made it clear that i did n’t want him to play again and he agreed			0
although he had successful surgery , he had to have time off school , and it was months before he could get back to playing the trombone or taking part in sport			2
the accident shook him up , knocking his confidence			0
he knew that next time , he might not be so lucky			0
when i told my younger son , then 11 , that he could n’t play rugby either , he was furious			1
over the course of her research and campaigning , @entity187 has had a lot of support from doctors and from parents , but also faced a hostility eventually , he accepted it , but it was hard for him			2
even though he ’d seen his brother ’s injuries , he did n’t understand the risks ; children think they ’re invincible			1
i had to take on the full force of the school ’s disapproval , too			0
over the course of my research and campaigning , i ’ve had a lot of support from doctors and from parents , but i ’ve also faced a hostility			2
this is a hugely emotive subject			0
people are passionate about rugby			2
some people say i am advocating a nanny state , but it ’s the state that picks up the pieces when children are injured , in terms of @entity222 care , special education support and social services			0
to my horror , i ’ve also faced personal abuse for my views , much of it from anonymous men who pepper their emails with swear - words			0
they say i have no right to comment on rugby , because i ’m a woman who has never played the game			2
that ’s ridiculous : i research and write about cancer , but i ’ve never had cancer either			0
many parents write to professor @entity1 asking how they can stop their rugby - loving sons playing , following nasty injuries many parents write to me asking how they can stop their rugby - loving sons playing , following nasty injuries			1
only yesterday , at 3.30am a father emailed me , saying : ‘ my son is concussed in hospital , how do i stop him from playing rugby again ? ’ i ’m not calling for a ban on rugby at school			1
i ’m calling for parents to be given information so they know the risks , and i want to see rugby made safer for children , with an end to scrums and tackles — where nearly all the injuries occur			1
i ’d like school rugby to become touch rugby , instead of contact rugby			1
all injuries should be recorded , and none should be acceptable or seen as ‘ an act of @entity264 ’			0
most of all , children should be safe at school			0
tackling @entity68 , what every parent should know about injuries by @entity1 ( @entity270 ) is published september 29 , priced £ 9.99 .			1
