a globetrotting musician from @entity1 has gone all out in recreating @entity4 composer @entity3 's first @entity2			1
singing 658 notes over 329 days in more than 25 cities across the world , @entity5 has managed to achieve his very own work of art. the 30 - year - old , who performed at concerts around the globe to fund his travels , remained disciplined in his filming			1
the result is this unique video travel log with a highly impressive soundtrack indeed			1
explaining why he chose @entity20 , he tells @entity21 : ' i needed a piece composed only by a melody , without harmony , so i could just sing it by myself without having to depend on including other people for other possible voices			2
' this was perfect for it , not only because it met that requirement , but also because it 's a beautiful and world wide well known piece			0
' a @entity34 performance : @entity5 from @entity1 managed to perform @entity3 's cello suite @entity35 by singing two chords a day during his time abroad each day , for just under a year , @entity5 found the time to sing two pitches in order to imitate this classical music extravaganza almost to perfection , despite having a very active social life			1
one moment he 's busy exploring a range of stunning landscapes across @entity48 and the next he is chilling on the beach back in @entity50 , using the subway in @entity52 , or playing in the snow in @entity54			1
but , as filming spans such a long period of time , he is often seen completing mundane tasks too such as bathing , hanging up laundry or even lying down for a nap			0
in the footage , you are immediately thrown into the traveller 's exciting world as he spends time with close friends , near and far			0
if only for a brief moment , it is fantastic to see all the different backdrops that make up nearly a year of his care - free life			2
fast paced : the 30 - year - old offers viewers a brief glimpse into his travels as he sings each chord in a different location however , @entity5 admits that he faced some technical difficulties while piecing the project together			1
one month before he finished , his editing software crashed and he lost all his hard work			0
but luckily he had been keeping the videos in two different hard - drives , just in case something like that happened , and he began reediting it from the beginning			0
' i wanted to shoot the video in the most beautiful possible landscapes , ' he adds			0
' for example , in @entity48 island hachijojima i climbed up a mountain for three hours just to get a good shot of the island , and then i got lost on my way back and it took me other 3 - 4 hours to get back to the village			1
now he 's here , now he 's there : @entity5 visits @entity50 , @entity48 and @entity52 during 11 months of travel ' some other days , right before sleeping i just realised i had n't recorded anything that day so i just did whatever			1
' during his time travelling , @entity5 says he did not have a specific route and booked tickets to different places on ' impulse ' , especially when he found a good deal and could afford it			0
' every city / village / culture i visited has their own thing going on ; their own strengths , their own weaknesses , and instead of deciding which one is the best , i 'd rather just try to get influenced by the best of each place			0
' disciplined : not a day passes that the golden voiced globetrotter missed a note upon his return , is there anywhere where is desperate to travel to again ? he says : ' i always repeat destinations and i try to travel places when they have their best weather			2
' i like to go up north in @entity128 on summer , @entity129 in fall and spring and the south of @entity50 in winter			2
' there 's still a lot of places i have n't been , i never visited the south hemisphere , and either @entity136 , @entity137 or @entity138 are continents where i really really want to go			0
and what advice would he give to anyone traveling around the world ? ' instead of visiting the tallest tower , the oldest temple , the biggest shopping mall , why not just try to live a daily life with local people , blend with their culture , eat where they eat , hang where they hang , and eventually become one more of them ? ' ' i wanted to shoot in the most beautiful possible landscapes ' - @entity5 mixed stunning scenery with the breathtaking classical piece to create a very special art work of his own the original video can be found here and for more of @entity159 's work check out his own @entity160			1
