@entity0 insists his struggling @entity2 side are being inhibited by the size of the @entity5 pitch , and that it is partly to blame for the team losing three of their five home league games this season			1
the @entity2 boss , who watched his side lose at home to @entity15 on sunday , believes the narrow pitch is making it easier for opposing teams to sit deep and soak up pressure			1
according to @entity22 figures quoted in the @entity23 , @entity2 ' pitch is one of the smallest in the @entity22 , with only @entity25 and @entity26 playing on smaller surfaces			1
@entity0 's former club @entity28 play on the joint - largest pitch in the division			1

@entity25 - 100m x 65.85m rankings by total pitch area according to official @entity22 figures prior to @entity2 's @entity64 fourth - round clash against @entity65 on wednesday , @entity0 explained why he feels his team are being handicapped by the @entity5 pitch			1
the former @entity28 boss said : ' our style means we need a bigger place to play because we play a positional game and it 's true that @entity5 is a little bit tight			1
' it 's better for the opponent			0
for example , on sunday @entity15 play deep , same with @entity52 and @entity55 , and it was difficult for us			0
we need time to adapt in our new set - up and understand better our position on the pitch			2
' @entity0 's argument might carry a bit more weight if his side had fared better on their travels , but @entity2 have been equally limp away from home			1
they have one win from four fixtures on the road , and that was at @entity56 , who play on the seventh - smallest pitch in the division			1
@entity2 's other away days have included a disappointing 2 - 2 draw with @entity50 ( joint - biggest ) and a 4 - 1 loss at @entity47 ( also joint - biggest )			1
the only result that really bears out @entity0 's claim that his side operate better on a a bigger pitch is the commendable 1 - 1 stalemate at @entity44 , whose @entity101 pitch is one of the joint - largest in the @entity22			1
but even that outcome could be seen to contradict the @entity40 's argument as the large @entity101 surface was designed to make it harder for visiting teams to sit deep and deny the @entity111 space - precisely what @entity2 did in the match			1
@entity44 moved their home @entity113 games to @entity115 in 1998 and played on a bigger pitch @entity44 's large playing surface is a far cry from the compactness of their old @entity121 ground , which was part of the reason they took the extraordinary step of moving their @entity113 home games to @entity115 for the 1998 - 99 and 1999 - 00 seasons			1
although the decision was primarily financially motivated , the @entity111 felt their expansive game was undermined by @entity121 's relatively small dimensions , offering a precedent to @entity0 's complaints			1
the @entity121 pitch had measurements of 100m long x 67m wide ( the same as @entity5 ) compared to @entity115 's 105m x 69m			1
stadium : mk , where @entity2 may temporarily move to while their new ground is being built , is larger than @entity5 , at 105x68m			1
@entity0 did not attribute his team 's indifferent form solely to the size of the @entity5 pitch though , and admitted that the team needs to improve its mental strength			1
@entity0 admitted that the mentality of his team must improve after the home defeat by @entity15 the @entity40 manager admitted that his team need to display more resilience			1
he said : ' i think we are the psychologists			0
the players want to hear the manager and the staff , the assistant manager , the goalkeeper coach			0
' in my career always , when i was a player , we had a lot of meetings , just the players for good and bad things			0
maybe here , it 's not the habit			0
we tried to push that because it 's important sometimes that the players have different meetings with the captain to realise some different situations			0
the players can always improve in their own meetings			0
@entity170 is in line to start against @entity65 on wednesday after his @entity173 hat - trick last week @entity65 drew 1 - 1 with @entity174 on saturday and are a lowly 21st in the championship ' we did a lot of work in groups , and as individuals			0
in the training ground , in meeting rooms , in my personal office , in different areas			0
but always you need more time to change the habits			0
we talk about mentalities and changing habits			0
' the mental process is always more slow than the physical or tactical			0
we are in a good way , i think our job does not reflect in the table			0
this is maybe a difficult period , but it is the process we have to go through			0
' @entity0 is expected to hand a start to @entity170 for the visit of @entity65 on wednesday , after the striker was dropped for the @entity15 clash despite scoring a hat - trick three days earlier against @entity202 in the @entity173 .			2
