by @entity1 reporter @entity3 scientists are baffled as to what - or maybe even who ? - created this unusual hole on the surface of @entity8			2
the hole was discovered by chance on images of the dusty slopes of the @entity8 's @entity14 volcano			1
it appears to be an opening to an underground cavern , partly illuminated to the right of the opening			0
a hole in @entity8 : the opening was discovered by chance on images of the dusty slopes of the @entity8 's @entity14 volcano analysis of this and follow - up images revealed the opening to be about 35 meters across			1
the interior shadow angle indicates that the underlying cavern is roughly 20 meters deep			0
why there is a circular crater surrounding this hole remains a topic of speculation , as is the full extent of the underlying cavern			2
@entity14 ( bottom centre ) is located at the southern edge of the @entity35 of volcanoes			1
the @entity38 volcanoes lie along the crest of a north - east trending rise - or @entity41 bulge - that extends more than 3,000 km across the western equatorial region of @entity8 holes such as this are of particular interest because their interior caves are relatively protected from the harsh surface of @entity8 , making them relatively good candidates to contain @entity8 life			0
these pits are therefore prime targets for possible future spacecraft , robots , and even human interplanetary explorers			0
the images were taken by the @entity59 instrument aboard the robotic @entity60 currently circling @entity8 .			1
