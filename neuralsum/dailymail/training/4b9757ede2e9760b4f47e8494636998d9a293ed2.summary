by @entity0 @entity1 is testing out a lighter pizza in two @entity4 markets as it seeks to freshen up its menu and regain its footing against competitors			1
the tests of the ' @entity10 ' pies began this week at several dozen restaurants in @entity12 , @entity13 , and @entity14 , @entity15			1
the pies simply use less of the same dough used for regular pies and are lighter on the toppings , said @entity20 , a @entity1 spokesman			1
lighten up : @entity1 is testing out a lighter pizza in two @entity4 markets as it seeks to freshen up its menu and regain its footing against competitors			1
currently , a regular pepperoni slice from a large pie contains 370 calories several fast - food and restaurant chains have turned to lighter offerings over the years as a way to update their images , with varying degrees of success			2
@entity34 , for instance , recently said the majority of its @entity4 restaurants would stop offering lower - calorie french fries less than a year after the so - called ' @entity38 ' were introduced			2
the test by @entity1 comes as the chain fights to win back market share			0
last year , @entity1 sales fell 2 percent at @entity4 locations open at least a year			1
@entity45 's , by contrast , saw the figure rise 5.4 percent while @entity48 's saw sales rise 4 percent in @entity49			0
@entity50 , a restaurant analyst with industry tracker @entity51 , noted that @entity1 may be suffering in part because it 's the biggest player and has the most to lose at a time when the pizza business overall is seeing moderate growth of about 2 percent to 3 percent a year			2
but he also noted that the chain has failed to ' evolve its product , ' while @entity48 's has played up its quality and @entity45 's improved its pizza			0
@entity1 is owned by @entity62 , which also owns @entity63 and @entity64			0
@entity1 is testing out a lighter pizza in two @entity4 markets : @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , @entity15 @entity1 's test varies in the two markets			1
in @entity12 , customers can create their own @entity10 pies with up to five toppings , with each slice having 300 calories or less			1
in @entity14 , customers can pick from one of six pre-determined pies , with each slice having 250 calories or less			2
the @entity10 pies are intended as a lighter version of @entity1 's hand - tossed crusts ; a plain slice of the regular hand - tossed pie has 300 calories , according to the chain 's website			1
a slice of the pan pizza has 350 calories and a slice of the ' thin ` @entity91 ' has 260 calories			0
@entity1 also rolled out ' @entity94 ' pies more than a decade ago that had even fewer calories than the new @entity10 pies by going lighter on toppings			1
if the test proves successful , the @entity10 pies would replace the @entity100 pies , which are still available on request , @entity20 said in an email			0
other pizza chains have tinkered with alternative crusts as well			0
@entity45 's introduced a gluten - free crust in 2012 that is still on the menu			0
during the @entity109 craze , @entity45 's also tested a whole wheat crust but ultimately abandoned the idea			0
' it did not take us very long to learn that people did not want that from @entity45 's , ' said @entity114 , a @entity45 's spokesman .			0
