by @entity0 a bow - hunter in @entity2 says he was attacked by a black bear while looking for deer			1
@entity5 , 61 , and his 26 - year - old son @entity6 were out on a hunt monday when he decided to sit down to rest for a minute			1
that 's when he saw the black bear coming at him at a dead run			2
' i stood up and in one motion that bear jumped out of the creek it was in and was on level ground with me , ' @entity5 , of @entity12 , told @entity18			1
' and as soon as it was on level ground it was on a dead run after me			0
' @entity5 is an avid outdoorsman , but running away from a black bear was a first for him a few days before @entity5 was bit by a black bear , his son captured this image of what appears to be the beast that bit him @entity30 is an avid outdoorsman who 's been hunting for decades — but having started bow hunting just four years ago , he did n't think he 'd have time and the skills to pick up his bow and shoot the charging bear			1
instead , he scrambled up a tree while the animal , which appeared to be 250 to 300 pounds , closed in on him			1
' i knew the tree was right there , so i headed up that to get far enough up the tree that the bear could n’t get me , ' @entity5 told @entity18			1
he thought he was out of the bear 's reach			2
' it totally amazes me how fast that bear got on me , ' @entity30 he told the newspaper			2
' in three seconds it was on me			0
' the black bear bit and clawed against the hunter 's left leg — and did n't let go until @entity5 kicked it in the snout with his right foot			1
' i was thinking , " if it gets me out of this tree i ’m a dead man , " ' he told @entity18			2
' it was mad , it was growling , it was serious about what it was going to do			0
' but amazingly , the bear let go after the kick , dropped to the ground and moved on			0
@entity5 waited around for a while and was eventually able to walk out and call for help			1
he was treated for puncture wounds and claw scratches at a hospital and is recovering at home			0
wildlife experts say black bears usually run away when they hear people			0
this unusual level of aggression indicates the bear may have been a mother protecting its cubs			0
local officials planned on euthanizing the bear — but @entity5 convinced them otherwise because of the likelihood it was a just a frightened animal acting our of motherly instincts			1
' it either had cubs out there or i was threatening its food , ' he told @entity18			0
' it ’s bear country			0
they live in the woods			0
' for his part , @entity5 has learned his lesson : next time he goes bow hunting , he plans to carry a pistol			2
