@entity0 's side beat @entity19 4 - 1 on saturday - a repeat of tuesday 's victory in the @entity22 at @entity23 - with @entity24 and @entity25 scoring two goals each			1
@entity24 rose above @entity27 to head @entity2 in front against @entity19 at the @entity4 @entity24 ( far left ) watches on as his header sails into the top corner of the @entity19 net @entity2 fans showed their support for @entity0 by chanting : ' there 's only one @entity0 ' @entity24 scored his second with a neat flick at the near post that rifled past @entity37 into the top corner the 28 - year - old ( second left ) is mobbed by his team - mates as they celebrate his second strike @entity42 was on target for the visitors , who lost for only the second time in their last 11 games			1
the home crowd sang : ' there 's only one @entity0 ' and the three points closed the gap on the top four			1
' my job is to win football games and make people happy , ' said @entity0			1
' what happened last week â€¦ i work for 18 years in this country and i am grateful that i have been accepted by 99.9 per cent with a big respect			0
' i can take the 0.1 per cent and live with it but my job is to make people happy			0
if they are not happy , i have to live with it			0
' on one side , we benefit because we have become extremely popular			0
on the other side , the negative is that everybody talks and has opinions and that is what is maybe more difficult to live with when it does n't go well			0
' @entity24 watches on as his strike nestles into the roof of the net to give @entity2 a 3 - 0 lead on 58 minutes @entity25 also scored twice during the win , the first a smart finish past @entity37 after some brilliant play @entity24 wheels away in celebration at giving the @entity80 the lead in their @entity83 encounter @entity2 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity84 6 ; @entity85 7 , @entity86 7 , @entity87 6.5 , @entity88 6.5 ; @entity89 6 ; @entity90 7.5 ( @entity91 87 , @entity92 ) , @entity93 7 ( @entity94 90 , @entity92 ) , @entity25 7.5 , @entity95 7 ; @entity24 8 ( @entity96 73 , @entity97 ) subs not used : @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 goals : @entity24 15 and 58 , @entity104 and 88 booked : @entity85 , @entity93 manager : @entity0 7.5 @entity19 : @entity37 4.5 , @entity27 5 , @entity106 6 , @entity107 5.5 , @entity108 6 , @entity109 5 , @entity110 6.5 , @entity111 5 , @entity42 5 ( @entity112 82 ) , @entity113 4.5 ( @entity114 56 , @entity92 ) , @entity115 4 ( @entity116 56 , @entity92 )			1

defeat at @entity136 next week and the pendulum may swing back towards the @entity139 lobby , but when everything comes together on the pitch , as it did on saturday , his team are still quick , creative and wonderful to watch			2
' we try and it 's always the same in football , ' said @entity0			2
' if you try to attack and you win , everybody says well done and when you do n't win , everybody says you are not realistic enough			2
our target is to keep our style but to defend well as well and that 's what we did today			2
' @entity24 was outstanding , opening the scoring after 15 minutes with a majestic header and flicking in @entity2 's third with the outside of his left boot			1
@entity25 produced a deft chip from a tight angle for the second			2
yet , even with this three - goal cushion , there was a ripple of anxiety around the @entity4 when @entity42 pounced with a diving header to make it 3 - 1 , with 27 minutes remaining			1
both @entity0 and @entity19 manager @entity124 felt memories of the @entity22 tie against @entity169 , last month , when @entity2 surrendered a three - goal lead to draw 3 - 3 , were haunting the stadium			1
@entity172 international @entity24 said after the game that @entity0 is still the right man for @entity2 @entity25 completed the win from the penalty spot as the @entity177 international chipped the ball down the middle ' you could see at some stage that we were a bit edgy , when we were 3 - 1 , the crowd as well , ' said the @entity2 boss			1
' there was the ghost of @entity169 here a little bit and we need a few more wins to completely lift the confidence			0
' in the last six games , we won five			0
we can score goals , we showed that again and overall it was a dynamic game			0
despite being depleted at the back we were quite solid and going forward we always looked dangerous			0
' in the end we won in a convincing way			0
the response was strong after the @entity17 game			2
let 's go well over @entity201			2
' @entity25 ( right ) hugs team - mate @entity90 who provided him the assist for his goal at the @entity4 @entity25 ( centre right ) is congratulated on his second strike of the match by his @entity2 team - mates @entity25 settled the nerves in the 88th minute by clipping a @entity210 - style penalty over the dive by @entity19 's rookie goalkeeper @entity37 after @entity95 had been fouled by @entity108			1
' @entity2 came out flying but we were n't as efficient with the ball as we 've been , ' said @entity124			2
' they did n't give us time			0
they were quicker and faster			0
we grew into it a little bit and i still thought at 3 - 1 that the game was in the balance and the demons might return from @entity169 if we could get another			1
' we have great belief and we do n't give up and we did n't give up , even though not playing our best			0
