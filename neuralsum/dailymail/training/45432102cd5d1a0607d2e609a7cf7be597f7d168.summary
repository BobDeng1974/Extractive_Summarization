@entity0 swallowed a second defeat in three days but not without launching a furious attack on referee @entity4 's decision to rule out an early goal by @entity6			1
@entity0 claimed he was ' confused ' and ' bewildered ' and that @entity7 would not have lost if the goal had stood			1
song 's fifth - minute volley was disallowed because @entity11 and @entity12 were both offside as they leapt out of the way , one jumping to the side and the other allowing the ball through his legs			1
they were ruled to be interfering with @entity23 's line of vision but the @entity7 boss claimed this clashed with information given to managers at the start of the season by the referees ' ruling body , the @entity33			1
' you base your opinions on what they tell you			0
he did n't touch the ball			0
he was n't in the eye - line of the keeper			2
' yes , he was offside but we 've seen so many of those allowed as goals			0
i 've not seen one ' not given '			0
' it 's gone through @entity12 's legs and he is three yards to the right of @entity23 , so he 's not in his eye - line			2
there are six players obstructing his eyeline			0
it 's come through everyone			0
' @entity4 can not have a clear view whether @entity12 is directly in the keeper 's eyeline			1
' even @entity76 admitted he was surprised the goal had been ruled out			2
song declines celebration against his former club before the referee @entity4 calls for offside anyway @entity0 swallowed a second straight defeat but not without launching a furious attack on @entity4 @entity0 summoned as evidence @entity86 's goal for @entity88 in @entity7 's 2 - 1 defeat at @entity90 in november			1
' if you go back to @entity88 away you can see why i 'm so angry and frustrated , ' he went on			2
' @entity86 was stood offside even though the ball ricocheted off our player to him , and that was given onside			0
' i 'm completely confused and bewildered			0
there are far too many inconsistencies			0
' if we 'd been allowed that goal , we would n't have lost			1
one - nil up that early would have kicked the lads on and @entity103 would have found life very difficult from then on			1
@entity105 steps up to take the penalty and makes no mistake to give @entity103 a 1 - 0 lead @entity109 can hardly miss from four yards as @entity103 almost immediately double their lead @entity11 ( left ) rises high to meet @entity112 cross and get @entity7 back in the match at 2 - 1 ' it was a real blow and , sadly , we 've ended up losing a game that was probably a great spectacle			1
it was combination of a couple of bad misses and a very poor decision			2
@entity0 had no complaints about the penalty given by @entity4 for a foul by @entity125 on @entity105 from which @entity105 opened the scoring			1
@entity109 scored the second and @entity11 pulled one back in the second half			1
' @entity129 stuck his leg up and he 's gone over on it , ' said the @entity7 manager , but claimed @entity133 had been punished for not diving in the penalty area when challenged by @entity135			1
' i just wish @entity133 had done similar when he got tugged by @entity135 in the last minute			0
he stayed on his feet			0
he was being fouled but did n't go down			0
' so , there 's another scenario for you			0
simulation is not nice , but when you don ' t get free - kicks for staying on your feet , you 're in a difficult situation			2

@entity7 lost 2 - 1 to @entity103 in their @entity147 clash
@entity105 and @entity109 scored for the @entity149
@entity11 pulled one back for the @entity7
but @entity6 had an early goal disallowed by @entity4
@entity0 was furious at what he saw was a wrong decision
