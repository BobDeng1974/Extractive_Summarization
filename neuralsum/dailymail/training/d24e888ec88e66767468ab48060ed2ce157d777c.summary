the @entity43 star instead focused his attention on creating figure - hugging shift dresses with dropped hemlines ( a recurring theme so far this weekend ) in buttermilk , yellow , moss green , duck egg blue and off white			1

she 's a siren who swims in a tropical ocean that 's glistening in the moonlight and full of tropical fish			2
she 's surrounded by buried treasure and glamorous things			2
' but his mermaid is , in his own words , obviously no ordinary mermaid			0
' she falls in love and lures a tattooed gorgeous man into the sea and it 's all about an underwater love of a mermaid surrounded by tattooed men , hence the flowers , the prints and the inspiration , ' he explained			0
the stand - out pieces ( if we really had to choose ) were two wedding dresses - a first for the popular designer			1
