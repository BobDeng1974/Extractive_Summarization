caged animals : prisoners in @entity11 ( pictured ) are allowed to care for fogs , rabbits and guinea pigs in a bid to keep them calm prisoners were in a nine - hour stand - off with guards in january at @entity11 , run by @entity32 and nicknamed ' @entity11 ' for its alleged lax security			1
reports at the time claimed up to 40 inmates had taken two guards hostage during the riot - before demanding @entity39 's meals were brought to their cells			0
yet @entity32 and the @entity40 dismissed these claims as ' completely untrue '			0
one of @entity42 's largest with 1,600 inmates , @entity11 was described as a model for future prisons by the government yet has been beset by controversy			1
yet the animal therapy scheme has been has been greeted with some cynicism			0
they are allowed to feed , clean out the animals and take them for walks in the grounds , but they are not allowed to take them back to their cells a source in the prison told the @entity60 : ' how on @entity62 can it be right that dangerous inmates are being treated to their own furry friends ?

prisoners in @entity11 are also allowed to care for dogs and rabbits
the aim behind pet therapy is to calm disturbed inmates
