by @entity0 last updated at 6:22 pm on 29th november 2011 he has successfully evaded capture for nearly three months while trekking 730 miles across mountains , deserts and highways			2
but , for once , this is not the case of the fugitive gunman doing his utmost to escape the police			0
it is the journey of a lovesick wolf who has become a media and internet celebrity in @entity16 during his epic search for a mate - taking him across most of @entity18 despite a ' dead or alive ' bounty on his head			1
path of true love : the wolf has traipsed more than 700miles across @entity25 's rugged terrain and highways in search of a mate in the dock : @entity30 from the @entity32 pack on the @entity33 in northeastern @entity18			1
a two - year - old left the pack shortly before the others were issued with a death warrant for killing cattle he left his home on september 10 just before state officials served a death warrant on members of his pack for killing cattle			1
and while some have grown fond of his antics , it is feared he will be targeted by poachers or government hunters			0
or - 7 , as he has been unlovingly dubbed , captured the imagination of @entity16 after the conservation group @entity52 mapped his journey on its website and @entity56 page			1
they have begun a competition to give the wolf a name - hoping it will make him too famous to shoot			2
one entry came up with : ' @entity63 '			0
but some are not so keen			0
cattle rancher @entity65 , who ranches near @entity66 , said : ' in this country , we worked really hard to exterminate wolves 50 years ago or so , and there was a reason			0
' a lot of people who do n't have a direct tie to the agricultural community tend to view wolves as majestic , beautiful creatures			0
they do n't seem so majestic and beautiful when they are ripping apart calves and colts			0
' keeping an eye out : @entity83 , a wolf co-ordinator for the @entity84 , with a female wolf pup just fitted with a radio collar - as was or - 7 , which has enabled officials to track its movements last february , or - 7 was in a snowy canyon in north - eastern @entity18 when a state biologist shot him with a tranquilizer dart from a helicopter before fitting him with a tracking collar and blue ear tags			1
officials have been able to chart his journey from @entity100 positions transmitted from the collar			2
they show he has traveled 730 miles on his meandering route , getting as far as 320 miles from home			2
each time he enters a new area , he makes it onto the local news			0
@entity108 set out on his trek just before state wildlife officials issued a death warrant for members of his @entity32 pack for killing cattle			1
the kill order specifically mentions @entity108 's father , the alpha male , and one younger wolf with no collar			1
since @entity108 and two siblings took off that would leave his mother and one pup			1
the department reports a government hunter had a shot , but missed and did not get another before conservation groups won a stay of the kill order while their legal challenge is settled by the @entity131			0
tough trek : the wolf climbed up into @entity25 's @entity134 ( pictured ) on his journey			0
at one point , a hunter shot at him , but missed wolves started moving into @entity18 from @entity140 in the late 1990s from packs introduced into the @entity142 as part of a federal endangered species restoration program			1
from trail cameras , radio tracking collar data and sightings , @entity84 figures the state has at least 23 wolves			2
all four packs are in the north - eastern corner of the state			1
two produced pups this year			0
federal protection for wolves was lifted in @entity18 , but they remain under state protection			1
@entity159 , they are back under federal protection			0
most of the wanderers become ' biological dead ends ' , but even if @entity108 dies alone , the trail of scent posts he has left will be followed by others			1
wolves typically strike out on their own when they reach two years old to look for a mate and empty territory they can call their own			0
once in the @entity134 , @entity108 meandered through the @entity170 , where @entity25 's last known wolf was shot by a bounty hunter in 1946			1
he skirted @entity174 and dropped down to the flatlands near @entity66 , climbed back up in the @entity134 , and crossed over the crest south of @entity177 , a snow - capped volcano visible from @entity178			2
so far there have been no reports of cattle killing along his path			0
@entity83 , the wolf co-ordinator for the @entity84 , has been surprised by the way the public has embraced the wandering wolf			2
he said : ' with all that 's going on right now with management of wolves in @entity18 , this is kind of a different side that people across the state have taken a shine to			1
' @entity108 's travels are not unusual , said @entity197 , the retired @entity198 wolf co-ordinator for the @entity142			2
a female from @entity200 headed south through @entity201 , crossed southeastern @entity140 , dropped down to @entity202 , crossed northern @entity203 , and headed back up to @entity201 , where she ate poison and died .			0

fled home in north - east @entity18 in september before state officials arrived to cull pack
