by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 06:44 est , 28 september 2012 they may look like the trails of a motorcycle from the sci - fi film @entity5 , but in fact these are a far more pedestrian form of transport			0
researchers at @entity11 created the maps to show exactly where people using @entity15 's hugely popular cycle hire scheme travelled to			1
the maps , which show 5 million journeys , have since been used by @entity19 to help them ensure enough bicycles are available for both tourists and commuters			1
the images reveal the routes around @entity15 users of the @entity31 cycle hire scheme use			1
the maps reveal an average day in the life of the @entity15 bicycle hire scheme and were created by visualisation expert professor @entity35 at @entity11 in @entity15			1
he based it on data from the first 5 million journeys pedalled in the @entity41 scheme since its launch in july 2010			1
' the data comes from @entity19 , and is publicly available , ' he said			1
' we were interested in seeing how we could show the behaviour of cyclists using the scheme			2
' because of the scale of the scheme traditional methods did n't work , and we wanted to make something visual			2
' the team used glowing purple lines to track the progress of riders over a day , revealing patterns as the amazing images are formed			2
the video tracks 5 million journeys taken by users of the @entity59 in @entity15			1
the top hire stations from last week were : 1			0
@entity61 , @entity61 - 3,085 hires 2			0
@entity62 , @entity63 - 2,131 hires3			0
@entity64 , @entity65 - 2,098 hires 4			0
@entity66 , @entity65 - 2,086 hires 5			0
@entity67 , @entity68 - 2,048 hires source : @entity19 ' the video is one example of the kind of visualisation we constructed - and it does show very clearly there are different behaviours			1
' there are the @entity65 leisure cyclist touring the parks , who were self contained within the park , creating a rectangle of colour in the the bottom right			0
' in contrast there are also commuters showing patterns from the major stations as people pick up bikes at stations and cycle into @entity15			2
' we also found a third , more complex pattern in the @entity98 , where people are moving to @entity101 street as well as from it during the day			0
; although the team initially began creating the maps on their own , they have since started working with @entity19 , who run the scheme			1
' lots of tidal commuting behaviour can mean bikes need to be moved , ' said professor @entity35			0
' this is helpful in predicting where @entity19 need to move bikes , and at what time			2
' in the animation , the curve of a route indicates the most frequent direction of travel : trajectories leave a station in a straight line and then hook into their destination			0
mayor of london @entity124 with bicycles used in scheme , dubbed ' @entity41 ' by many			0
researchers have now used the data from the journeys to create an incredible colourful map tracing cyclists routes			1
first launched in 2010 , the @entity59 has been used for over 16 million journeys			1
dubbed ' @entity41 ' after mayor of london @entity124 's enthusiasm for them , the bikes are accessed at docking stations dotted around @entity15			1
tourists can use interactive touchscreen stations at each docking point to book cycles , while regular commuters can get special ' keys ' allowing to to simply take bikes whenever they want			0
@entity19 use the maps to reveal patterns , and work out which stations need to have bikes manually added or removed to keep the system running			2
some have likened the maps to the trails left by ' light cycles ' in the sci fi film @entity5 .			0
