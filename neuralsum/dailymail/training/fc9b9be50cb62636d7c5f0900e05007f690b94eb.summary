what about in slow motion ? speeded up ? yes , it does take a few sessions to try it all out but i ca n't see your partner complaining , can you ? step 3 : ask around think you 've found an erotic innovation that 's uniquely yours ? do a quick survey of all your friends , go online ( or watch all the old @entity109 episodes ) to find out how common it is and how well it 's likely to be received			2
no need to confess what you 're up to , just wait till everyone 's had a couple and start a general conversation about what you want to be expert in			0
say you read some quirky fact about it online ( make it up ! ) and ask what they think is the best tip they 've ever done / heard of ? make sure you ask a mix of same and opposite sex friends to get both perspectives			1
