this was a life changing and life threatening decision for me to make			2
' at 32st , it was not an easy decision as i had been turned down for the surgery two and a half years previously ' it had got to a point where something had to be done because i was slowly killing myself			1
i was just waiting for something awful to happen and even needed psychiatric help			2
' although he never indulged in binge - eating , mr @entity35 says he would eat smaller portions at regular intervals and was drinking around eight cans of cola a day			1
but the former bomb disposal expert had n't always been big and he says that growing up , he lived an active lifestyle , regularly playing rugby and competing in wrestling			2
flashback : mr @entity35 said he was almost a recluse when he was at his biggest ( above ) as he got older , he began to struggle with his weight thanks to a lifestyle of long - haul flights , business meetings and boozy evenings spent entertaining clients			2

using high - pressure water technology , he would set about the grim task of defusing bombs			2

' mr @entity35 , who is now a business development manager at a demolition and asbestos removal firm , said as the years went by , his weight crept up			0
' i had a very active lifestyle before my work and life balance was disrupted and i began to not have time to eat right , ' he said			0
' i was never one of those people who would eat massive amounts of food where you are stunned by the amount but i did have small portions regularly			0
' ever since i was a child , i always drank coke			0
at one point , i was having between six to eight cans a day			1
i have had to completely cut coke out of my life as well as other fizzy drinks			1
i do n't mind if i never have one again			0
' the father - of - three said his weight affected his self confidence and esteem as a result of the weight gain , mr @entity35 almost became housebound at his heaviest and was forced to plan every trip out			1
his weight issues even affected his working life , as well as his confidence and self esteem			0
' i was forced to park the car as close as possible to wherever i was going , if i could n't , i 'd have to turn back and go home , ' he recalls			0
' i was almost becoming a recluse as i was unable to visit sites for my work so instead worked from home			0
i was becoming a burden on my family , especially when we tried to go on holiday			0
i had to be taken to the plane by a buggy or wheelchair			1
' @entity126 up , he took the plunge and opted for surgery - a decision that coincided with him finding that he was about to become a grandfather			1
both of his daughters , aged 26 and 36 , were expecting babies			0
' my one daughter came to see me while i was recovering from the operation and broke the news that she was pregnant , ' said mr @entity35 , who also has a 34 - year - old son			1
although he never indulged in eating too many snacks , he said he would drink up to eight cans of coke a day ' i was so thrilled as i knew the success of the surgery would allow me to be more active and enjoy spending time with them as they are growing up			1
' as well as losing more than a stone a month , he has also seen his waist shrink from 66 inches to 42 inches and his chest go down from 66 inches to 48 inches			2
