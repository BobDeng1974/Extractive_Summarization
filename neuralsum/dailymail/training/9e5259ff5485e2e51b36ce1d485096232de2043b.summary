@entity0 asked 10 current and ex-boxers , both former and reigning champions and @entity4 gold medallists among them , to give their verdict on the big fight			1
@entity9 wo n’t be so macho this time ; he knows he can get knocked down			0
verdict : @entity19 ( lost to @entity11 in 2011 ) i keep changing my mind			0
@entity11 boxed well last time but @entity9 is the champion ; he has a lot of heart and a good @entity24 : @entity25 composed : @entity26 believes @entity9 will not be so ' macho ' this time decisions : @entity28 keeps changing his mind but is going for @entity11 ( undefeated heavyweight ) i do n’t think @entity11 is world class but @entity9 will have to stop him because he wo n’t get a points decision			1
verdict : @entity19 ( former undisputed world heavyweight champion ) i think @entity9 will start quicker this time but he has to watch out for the big right hand from @entity11			1
verdict : @entity19 backing the @entity36 : @entity37 believes @entity9 will have to watch out for @entity11 ' right hand , while @entity39 does n't think the west @entity40 is world class , but that @entity9 will have to stop him ( @entity4 super-heavyweight champion ) @entity9 is experienced ; @entity11 is skilful			1
@entity11 is likely to start sharp as he did last time , but i think @entity9 is going to break him @entity45 : @entity19 ( former world cruiserweight champion ) i do n’t see this going the distance — they are too explosive			1
it ’ll take a lot of concentration and control from @entity11 not to go for glory ; the red mist can come down with @entity56 : @entity19 break down : @entity57 thinks @entity9 will break down the more skilful @entity25 knockout : @entity59 thinks @entity9 will knock @entity25 out - @entity60 needs to keep his head as well ( @entity65 middleweight ) as the fight goes on and the sharpness leaves @entity11 , @entity9 ’s strength and stamina will become a factor			1
i ’m leaning towards @entity9 by late stoppage or close points @entity72 : @entity19 ( world super bantamweight champion ) @entity9 will start quicker this time , he ca n’t be as cagey and he ’s got to have a tighter defence			0
i think he ’ll be behind after six but will catch up in the later rounds			0
verdict : @entity19 factors : @entity9 's superior strength and stamina will play a part the longer the fight goes on quicker : @entity81 expects @entity9 to start quicker and then takeover in the later rounds ( @entity65 cruiserweight ) @entity9 will be more wary this time			2
i can see @entity25 winning the first few rounds as he did in the first fight			0
but i expect a more conclusive stoppage for @entity9 , between rounds 8 and @entity88 : @entity19 ( @entity90 captain ) my old @entity90 team - mate @entity91 has been sparring with @entity9 , and he says he is looking pretty good			2
i can see a @entity92 or @entity11 winning on points			0
if i had to bet i ’d go for @entity94 : @entity19 two more for @entity9 : both @entity95 ( left ) and @entity96 are expecting @entity9 to retain his titles i hope it lives up to the pre-fight talk			0
i like @entity11 ’ style and he was unlucky not to win the first bout , but he might have missed his chance			2
i ca n’t see @entity9 making the same mistakes @entity103 : @entity19 i think it ’s pretty much a 50/50 fight			0
whoever performs best on the night will win ; if i was betting i would bet on @entity9 to @entity72 : @entity19 hype : @entity109 hopes the fight lives up to its billing and is banking on @entity9 too close to call : @entity112 says it is too tight and down t whoever performs better on the night @entity9 ca n’t box any worse than he did in the first few rounds last time			1
i change my mind every minute			0
they will come out slugging which is why i think it will be @entity9 in the early @entity123 : @entity19 @entity11 shut a lot of people up last time			2
people thought he was just a mouthy little @entity40 , but he walked the @entity127 : @entity25 sluggers : @entity129 is expecting @entity9 to score a knock out in the early rounds surprise : @entity133 expects @entity11 to win after ' shutting people up ' in the first fight			1
