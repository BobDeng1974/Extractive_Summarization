@entity0 secured his first trophy triumph as @entity3 manager – then cut short the celebrations by slapping a midnight curfew on his players			1
goals from @entity8 and substitute @entity9 – who also missed a late penalty – secured the @entity11 against 10 - man @entity12			1
with the sides set to meet for a third time in 10 days in wednesday ’s @entity19 replay , however , the @entity15 coach warned his players to forget any notions of a @entity22 - style blow - out			1
@entity0 hopes to become the third @entity3 manager to achieve a domestic treble with the @entity25 ‘ we should enjoy the moment , but there is not going to be any nightlife , ’ @entity0 said , reacting to the furore created by his skipper ’s revelry in @entity30 strip clubs four nights before the final			1
‘ the players will have a calm night			2
we will go back to the stadium and have a couple of beers and enjoy it , but it will be early to bed before midnight and be ready for training tomorrow at 1pm			2
’ @entity0 then joked : ‘ for the staff it ’s a little bit longer			1
’ despite urging his players to be ‘ 24 - hour athletes ’ earlier this season the @entity48 played down the seriousness of the @entity22 incident , with pictures of the skipper slumped on a pavement plastered over the pages of newspapers			1
@entity22 lifts the @entity11 alongside @entity57 ( right ) after a difficult week in the headlines insisting there was no question or disciplinary action or dropping the 29 - year - old , @entity0 added : ‘ this case , for me , is not a big one			1
he was home at 10.30			2
it just looks like he was home at six in the morning			2
‘ he was drinking , he had a day off the day after			2
i have no rules about that			2
i said the players have to be fit – and @entity22 is the fittest player we have			2
‘ but we have a reputation to take care of and the way the pictures appeared in the newspaper was nothing for him or me to be proud of			2
so we have to learn from this			0
‘ when you play for @entity3 everybody chases you and you do n’t get the personal time			1
‘ you have to always know what you are doing			0
@entity3 manager @entity0 gets ready to lift the @entity11 with his players on sunday ‘ this is something everybody has to learn from – but , again , it was not a big issue for me			1
’ asked if @entity22 had apologised , the @entity15 boss added : ‘ he was not happy about it , but he did n’t do anything big or harmful for me			0
‘ it ’s not a positive example for youngsters			0
but @entity94 has played 60 or 65 matches this year , he had a day off and wanted to be out with his friends			0
‘ as i said he was home at 10.30pm so it was not a big thing			0
we will see if he learns in the future but he made up for it today – he played a very good game			0
’ keeper @entity57 gets the drinks flowing in the dressing room and sprays champagne ast his team - mates @entity108 was also quick to support his captain with the 29 - year - old leading his club to the first leg of what @entity3 hope will be a rare treble			1
and despite admitting it was ; not what you want to see ’ , @entity108 insists his midfield colleague showed his class in sunday ’s 2 - 0 win			1
‘ i think @entity122 showed what a captain he is today – a captain with a big letter at the front , ’ @entity108 said			0
‘ i thought he was absolutely fantastic			0
he ’s 100 per cent in training every day so when that ( night out picture ) came up i was n’t concerned , not even a little bit			0
@entity3 manager @entity0 urges his side to remain focused as they continue to chase a domestic treble ‘ it ’s not what you want to see happening , but it ’s happened and you have to move on			1
but what @entity22 did today was unbelievable			0
he showed today what a player he is			0
’ deila meantime believes his side fully merited their step towards his target of a domestic treble and said : ‘ it is a great feeling			1
‘ it is good to get a good start when you are the manager in a big club such as @entity3 and this was the first trophy we could win			1
we did it and you get an appetite from this			0
‘ you want more and i am happy for the boys and proud of them			0
i think we put in a professional performance			0
you should really enjoy this moment			0
@entity158 ( left ) celebrates @entity9 's strike for @entity3 as they beat @entity12 ‘ you can never rest on what you have done before			1
‘ we have talked about the treble many times and it is a dream			1
it is so tough to do it , but it is possible and the dream is still alive			0
we have one trophy and we have to be back again on wednesday if we are to win another cup trophy			1
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , insists he knows nothing of reports of a loan deal for @entity175 legend @entity174 during the @entity176 off - season next january			1
amid claims @entity3 could help the former @entity179 captain keep fit for three months @entity0 said : ‘ no , that ’s a new thing to me			1
that ’s a year away until that time and we have to take it day by day instead			2
but @entity174 is a hero			0
he is a @entity175 star and best player of all time			2
it ’s a good name , but we will see if that ’s possible in january			0
it ’s something you know more about than me			0
