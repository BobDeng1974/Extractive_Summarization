@entity0 has revealed that he does not believe that president @entity2 's assassin worked alone as the government claimed in their official finding			2
the secretary of state added more credibility to conspiracy theories surrounding the former president 's death by becoming one of the highest - ranking politicians to openly admit to being suspicious of the official finding			0
' to this day , i have serious doubts that @entity15 acted alone , ' @entity0 told @entity17 's @entity16 in an interview timed with the 50th anniversary of @entity2 's death			1
suspect : secretary of state @entity0 said that he believes that an outside force - possibly in the @entity22 or @entity23 - influenced @entity15 's decision to kill president @entity2 moments before : @entity0 rejects some of the more far - flung theories about president @entity2 's death - saying that there was n't a second shooter and the @entity29 was not involved - but he does think there is more to learn ' i certainly have doubts that he was motivated by himself , i mean i 'm not sure if anybody else is involved - i wo n't go down that road with respect to the @entity36 theory and all that - but i have serious questions about whether they got to the bottom of @entity15 's time and influence from @entity23 and @entity41			1
' the particular theory that @entity0 mentioned is one that was ignored by the @entity43 who investigated the 1963 shooting			2
a number of witnesses recalled seeing smoke and smelling gunpowder near a grassy knoll along the parade route , hinting that there could have been a second shooter who fired from a different angle			1
the connections that @entity15 had to @entity41 and @entity23 that the secretary of state mentioned are far more factual convictions , as it is known that @entity15 defected to the @entity22 and moved there			1
he only returned to the @entity59 the year before @entity2 was shot			0
back in the day : @entity0 , seen at the bottom right corner of the 1972 photo , volunteered for @entity2 's @entity63 campaign a decade earlier in 1962 and the two became close , staying friends throughout @entity2 's life working together : then - senator @entity2 is seen on the @entity67 speaking with the @entity68 , a group that @entity0 ( circled ) led when he did come back to the @entity59 , @entity15 lived in @entity69 and rented out a room from am advocacy group called @entity72			1
he spent a good deal of time with communist sympathizers , and travelled to @entity76 in september 1963 - just two months before @entity2 's assassination - in hopes of obtaining a visa and going on to @entity23 , but his visa application was rejected			1
‘ i think he was inspired somewhere by something and i do n't know what or if or any - i ca n't pin anything down on that , ’ @entity0 said in the interview			0
in spite of his lingering feelings about there being ‘ more ’ to the assassination , @entity0 categorically rejected the idea that the @entity29 was behind the assassination , which has been a favorite alternate scenario among anti-government conspiracy theorists			1
@entity0 was being interviewed as part of a series on the influence of the assassination , and though he was a college student at the time , the former presidential candidate did have a connection to the @entity2 family			2
looking back : the interview was part of a series being compiled by @entity16 ( left ) about the 50th anniversary of @entity103 's death as a @entity105 native , @entity0 chose to volunteer for @entity2 ’s senatorial campaign in 1962 and they remained close for the rest of the senator ’s life			0
@entity0 told @entity16 about the one time that he met @entity103 at the @entity113 when he was working for his brother and got a call saying that they were all going to go out for a sail in @entity67			0
‘ i 'm in between high school and going off to college and he said " where you going ? " and i said @entity120 and i grimaced knowing he was a @entity123 guy and he looked at me and he said " no , no that 's great now because i now have a @entity120 degree , " @entity0 said			0
‘ he had just gotten his @entity120 honorary degree and he could n't have been nicer about it and talked to me about the campaign and what @entity2 was doing , and we raced off and went sailing			0
‘ it was totally surreal			0

secretary of state @entity0 thinks that the shooter was influenced
suggests it has something to do with the time @entity15 spent in the @entity22 and his connections to communist sympathizers
does not support the ' grassy knoll ' theory or the idea that the @entity29 was involved
