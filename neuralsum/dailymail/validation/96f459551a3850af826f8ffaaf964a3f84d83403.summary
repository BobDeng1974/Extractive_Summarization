so much for the start of a green - and - white procession towards the title			1
having just cruised beyond their nearest challengers , @entity3 promptly ran into a roadblock			1
it was built by a deeply determined @entity8 side seemingly inspired by a return to the scene of the greatest day in the club ’s history			1
@entity13 was n’t on the books when they lifted last season ’s @entity16 , yet his winning strike here was worthy of its own place in the memory banks of every @entity23 fan			1
with that pure , powerful swipe of his right boot , @entity13 not only lifted his team into the @entity28 top six , but kept @entity3 within six points of @entity30			1
a run of ten successive domestic victories – a sequence which had granted @entity34 a new level of acclaim from @entity38 supporters – was brought to a shuddering halt			1
@entity8 's @entity13 marked first @entity28 start with a glorious first - time effort bookmakers will hardly be hiking their odds on them ending up with a four successive league crown			1
that much can still be viewed as a racing certainty			0
here , though , was evidence that the odd chicane may still have to be negotiated en route			0
by the next time @entity3 play in the top - flight – at @entity49 on march 18 – they will have come through @entity16 last eight and @entity52 final meetings against @entity53			1
their treble ambitions will be much clearer after that double - header , but any repeat of the wayward sluggishness shown last night will place the much - desired clean sweep in peril			2
to focus only on the failings of the @entity38 side would , however , be a gross injustice to @entity8			1
not for the first time in his tenure , manager @entity63 produced the ideal tactical plan for his charges to follow			0
@entity3 's @entity68 ca n't hide his disappointment after the defeat by @entity8 they had numerous fine performers and defended doggedly , occasionally desperately , throughout			1
but it was n’t only @entity13 who brought @entity74			1
in @entity76 , who operated just off central striker @entity77 , they had the most impressive overall contributor on show			0
now two points ahead of @entity53 , @entity63 ’s men look well set for a fourth consecutive top - half finish			2
the @entity38 pitch is far from pristine as spring approaches but that could n’t entirely account for the sloppiness @entity3 showed in the first half			1
compared with some of their recent showings , this was turgid stuff at times			0
as expected , they still dominated both possession and chances , yet @entity94 was n’t exactly in need of a lie down at the interval			0
@entity98 – making his first appearance since being late back from @entity100 prior to the first leg against @entity102 – offered the first flicker of threat with an angled shot whipped across the face of goal			0
perhaps the most fluid move of the opening period then led to @entity110 striking a wicked curler first - time			2
@entity94 stretched high to thwart it before denying @entity98 on the follow - up			2
@entity3 manager @entity34 sits dejected in the dugout o wednesday night @entity68 was being rationed on opportunities at the apex of @entity34 ’s side			1
he took matters into his own hands with a low , left - foot thump that zipped fractionally wide from almost 30 yards out			2
the striker then threatened to hare clear down the left when released by @entity124 ’s quick throw , only to be halted by a @entity13 foul straight from the ‘ professional ’ drawer			1
the @entity23 midfielder earned both a yellow card from referee @entity128 and a jabbing finger of rebuke from @entity131			1
@entity132 had dropped to the bench after showing signs of tiredness against @entity30 , which meant @entity136 taking a step back to partner @entity131 in central midfield			1
it was far from a radical alteration but the pieces were n’t quite clicking into place			0
@entity143 looked as likely as any in @entity3 colours before the break but his rising drive was beaten away by @entity94			1
@entity8 were persistently stretched but kept going about their defending in an organised manner			2
there were , though , only the most fleeting signs of danger at the opposite end of the field			0
@entity13 ( far right ) celebrates with his team - mates after scoring against @entity3 @entity155 was forced to divert a @entity157 shot behind , before @entity76 had their clearest opportunity of the half			1
after @entity161 was hustled off the ball , @entity76 cut along the 18 - yard line but failed to find the space on either side of @entity124			2
@entity34 opted for a switch at half - time , introducing @entity168 for @entity169			0
the attack - minded @entity170 slotted in at left - back , with @entity161 shifted to the opposite flank			0
the move carried an element of risk , with @entity176 looking unsure defensively , but @entity3 fell behind to a 53rd minute strike they could have do nothing about			2
@entity13 watched @entity76 ’s corner being headed out and stepped forward to connect with a quite brilliant half - volley that arrowed past @entity124 from 25 yards			1
expect it to feature on all forthcoming goal of the season showreels			0
saints should have gone two in front in quick succession when another somehow found its way through to @entity190			0
it was , though , a case of wrong man in the right place as the centre - back miscued wide from around eight yards			0
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity124 attempts to catch the ball in the air under pressure @entity34 had watched it all from the edge of his technical area with increasing concern			2
he played his final hand before the hour mark , withdrawing @entity110 and @entity98 for @entity204 and @entity132			0
that allowed @entity136 to step forward into his more regular role and help bring about the inevitable rise in pressure			0
@entity94 made a terrific stop to thwart an @entity161 headed from @entity136 ’s corner before then grasping a @entity132 daisy - cutter at the second attempt			0
another @entity214 shot was calmly clutched to his chest			0
the signal for only two minutes of added time brought loud jeers from the home support			0
rightly , they suspected that last night was simply one of those occasions when their team would need a lot longer to find the net .			0

on - loan @entity227 midfielder @entity13 scored winner for @entity23
@entity8 up to sixth and @entity30 given fresh hope in title race
@entity3 suffer shock defeat after 10 domestic victories in a row this year
