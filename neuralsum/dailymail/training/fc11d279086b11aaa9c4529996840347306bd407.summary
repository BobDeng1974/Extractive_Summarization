being rich and powerful was little protection to the children of the @entity2 who , to the astonishment of scientists , appear to have suffered from rickets			1
the @entity2 were among the most powerful families of the @entity7 , being patrons to @entity9 and @entity10 , but their children still suffered malnutrition , research has indicated			2
@entity14 is closely linked to malnutrition and poverty yet the bones of the remains of nine @entity20 children analysed by osteoarchaeologists reveal that they also fell victim to the condition			1
the skull ( a&b ) and leg bones ( c ) of don @entity26 , who died aged 4 in 1577 , showed signs of rickets			1
he was the seventh child of @entity30 and @entity31			0
the circular cut around the skull was from an autopsy soon after his death			0
researchers made the discovery after analysing bones taken from under the floor of the crypt of the @entity41 of @entity42 in @entity43			1
the tomb of @entity45 , the last @entity46 ( 1671 – 1737 ) , was selected for study because it was still intact , despite previous investigations of @entity49 , some from before the second world war			2
a secret entrance to the tomb was discovered when a marble disc , previously believed to be just decorative , was removed from the floor of the chapel , revealing a set of stone steps that led to a hidden crypt			1
a large sarcophagus contained the remains of the @entity46 but on the floor were a series of small coffins and several loose bones which had all been moved about when the @entity66 flooded in 1966			2
bones from children in the crypt , aged from newborn to about five years old , showed classic signs of rickets , including bow legs and bent arms , scientists from the universities of @entity69 and @entity70 concluded			1
the lack of vitamin d that caused the condition was attributed by the research team to the @entity2 ’ desire to protect their offspring			0
arm bones ( a&b ) , leg bone ( c ) and ribs ( d ) from a nine - month @entity20 baby showing classic signs of deformity from rickets			1
scientists who analysed the remains suspect the swadling of babies and extended weaning were the most likely causes of the vitamin d deficiency			0
one of the children ’s body ’s was identified as that of don @entity26 ( 1577 - 1582 ) who was known to have had a slightly deformed skull			2
the researchers suggest rickets was the cause			2
‘ diagnosis of a metabolic disease linked to vitamin d deficiency would appear unexpected in children brought up at the court of a @entity7 high social class family , like the @entity20 , ’ the researchers wrote			1
previous studies have already shown that the @entity2 continued weaning their children until they were two , with the addition of ‘ pap ’ , probably made from bread and apple or cereal			2
this diet lacked the essential vitamin d that the children needed and meant that when they learn to crawl and walk their weight bent their leg and arm bones			1
babies that were found in the crypt also showed early signs of rickets with lesions to their skulls			1
two of the @entity20 clan , ( left ) @entity30 ( 1541 - 1587 ) and his father ( right ) @entity135 ( 1519 - 1574 ) who between them fathered at least four of the children in the crypt and perhaps seven			1
the remains of the children analysed by scientists show they suffered from rickets thought to have been caused by poor diet and being kept indoors the @entity2 , in common with many other wealthy families , kept their young children indoors which could have prevented them from absorbing enough vitamin d from sunlight			1
swaddling babies was also commonplace and this would also have reduced their expose to sunlight			0
the research team wrote : ‘ the present study clearly demonstrates how , even in the high social classes , children were at the risk of developing rickets as a result of prolonged breast - feeding and inadequate exposure to sunlight			1
‘ with this prolonged breast - feeding , vitamin d deficiency is highly expected to rise , in particular if the other main risk factor , inadequate sunlight exposition , is associated with this diet based on maternal milk			0
the @entity20 family rose to power in the 13th century in @entity43 and @entity169 through banking and commerce			1
their patronage of the arts made the region the cradle of the @entity7			0
among the artists and scientists they supported were @entity9 , @entity179 , @entity10 , @entity180 and @entity181			0
@entity183 @entity182 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 were all @entity2			0
in 1737 the dynasty ended when the last @entity20 ruler died without a male heir			2
‘ two hours per week is the required minimum period of exposure to sunlight for infants if only the face is exposed ‘ during the spring and summer months , infants were likely to be exposed to sufficient sunlight to prevent vitamin d deficiency , but during the colder winter months , they probably spent less time outdoors and were bundled in several layers of protective clothing , especially when they presented frequent health problems			0
‘ for example , according to historical sources , @entity201 was a weak and unhealthy child , suffering from recurrent illness episodes and likely to have been frequently kept indoors			0
‘ furthermore , in the @entity7 period , non-ambulant children were swaddled , leaving very little skin exposed			0
’ newborn babies should have enough vitamin d from their mothers at birth but , researchers suspect , the mothers may also have suffered from vitamin d deficiency , perhaps as a result of being kept indoors or their practice of wearing thick make - up to prevent them getting a tan			0
‘ a pale ivory skin was considered a sign of health and elegance , which distinguished noblewomen from peasants engaged in field work , ’ the researchers reported in the @entity225 of @entity226			0
‘ a white skin was highly desired so that women avoided exposure to sunlight and used white powder to achieve it ; one of the most popular and well - known lightening creams was @entity237 , a white powder obtained by mixing vinegar with lead , which remained popular for about 300 years			0
’ the @entity20 women were also likely to have suffered low levels of vitamin d because of repeated childbirth .			2

bones from nine @entity20 children have been found to have signs of rickets
despite all their riches , a poor diet is *blamed* as one of the prime factors
