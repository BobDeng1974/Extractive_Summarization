@entity0 today announced its first robotic vacuum cleaner , after 16 years of research and £ 28 million of investment			2
the @entity5 will cost in the region of £ 750 when it goes on sale in @entity8 next summer			2
the robot uses a panoramic camera lens on top of the machine to map its way around the house , moving on caterpillar tracks and cleaning each room before going back to its docking station			1
it uses a panoramic camera lens on top of the machine to map its way around the house , moving on caterpillar tracks and cleaning each room before going back to its docking station infrared sensors will stop it bumping into furniture			1
users will set its cleaning schedule via a smartphone app - allowing them to start a clean even when out of the house			1
the panoramic lens ' shape and position gives the robot the ability to see around a room			1
its live vision cameras capture 30 images a second , to build complete and continuously updated picture of its environment			1
the ‘ eye ’ also features ‘ simultaneous localisation ’ and mapping software to create a 360 ˚ view of the room			1
the @entity5 robot can then identify features within these images to triangulate its position relative to the room , similar to how sailor use stars to navigate boats			2
it also detects objects and avoids obstacles ahead using proximity and infrared sensors			0
elsewhere , it features a @entity0 digital motor v2 that spins at @entity70 generating the highest suction of any robot vacuum			1
its @entity74 technology pulls microscopic dust and allergens out of the air and into the bin			0
continuous tank tracks maintain speed and keep the robot on course as it moves across different floor types			1
and the @entity85 app means owners can remotely control the robot vacuum , and schedule cleans			1
@entity0 follows @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 into the robotic vacuum cleaning sector , but the company claims 360 degree camera - which can see all around the room at once - is unique			2
the @entity8 firm says the machine has the most powerful suction of any robot vacuum on the market			1
the cleaner is powered by a @entity103 digital motor - the result of £ 150million of research - and uses the company ’s bagless @entity74 technology to separate dust and dirt			1
sir @entity0 , who launched the machine in @entity111 this morning , said : ‘ most robotic vacuum cleaners do n’t see their environment , have little suction , and do n’t clean properly			0
‘ we ’ve been developing a unique 360 degree vision system that lets our robot see where it is , where it has been , and where it is yet to clean			2
‘ vision , combined with our high speed digital motor and cyclone technology , is the key to achieving a high performing robot vacuum – a genuine labour saving device			1
’ the new machine is @entity0 ’s second attempt at a robotic cleaner			0
in 2001 the firm was close to launching the @entity135 - a large robotic machine which relied on dozens of infrared sensors all around the body			0
the panoramic lens ' ( pictured ) shape and position gives the robot the ability to see around a room			1
its live cameras capture 30 images a second , to build a complete and continuously updated picture of its environment			1
the ‘ eye ’ also features ‘ simultaneous localisation ’ and mapping software to create a 360 ˚ view of the room continuous tank tracks , or caterpillar tracks , maintain speed and keep the robot on course as it moves across different floor types ( pictured )			1
once the house is clean , the robot navigates back to its docking station but the company decided to abandon the project and go back to the drawing board , weight - 2.37kg ( 5.2lbs ) size - 9 inches ( 23cm ) diameter , 8.2inches ( 21cm ) height width of cleaning path - 8.3inches ( 21.3cm )			2
motor wattage - @entity169 volume of dust bin - 0.4 litres battery life - 20 - 30 minutes without fading – it then returns to its docking station to charge cost – in the region of £ 750 date on sale – summer 2015 in @entity8 , @entity177 2015 in @entity111 @entity178 , a robotics design engineer at the firm , said : ‘ this is a good example of how we will not release a technology until we are sure it will be a really high performer			1
‘ we were going to release the @entity184 in 2001 but we decided to start again			0
it had so many sensors on it that it became really heavy and was just not right			0
’ since then @entity0 has had a permanent team of robotics engineers working on a robot cleaner			0
for the last two years 200 engineers have been working on the @entity20 model , which weighs 2.37 kg ( 5.2lbs ) - less than a full - sized @entity0 cleaner			0
@entity0 told @entity195 there were more than 420 patents and patent applications worldwide relating to technology used in the robot			0
the camera - which is central to its performance - takes up to 30 images of the room every second and means the machine can constantly establish where it is , where it has been and where it still needs to clean			1
elsewhere , the @entity5 ( pictured left ) features a @entity0 digital motor v2 that spins at @entity212 , this is the highest suction of any robot vacuum			1
its @entity74 technology ( pictured right ) pulls microscopic dust and allergens out of the air and into the bin this graphic reveals the component parts of the new vacuum design , that was said have cost £ 28 million during 16 years of research			0
@entity0 told @entity195 there were more than 420 patents and patent applications worldwide relating to technology used in the robot			0
it can also be controlled remotely using an app the machine has 20 to 30 minutes of battery life and manoeuvres around on tank - like tracks that can take it over small obstacles			1
when it runs out of battery it will return to its docking station , resuming the clean when it has charged again			0
when the 0.4litre dust bin is full a message will be sent to the user ’s smartphone			0
the cyclone technology captures particles down to 0.5 microns - or 600 times smaller than a standard typed full stop			0
the brush bar ( pictured ) extends to full width of the machine and uses patented carbon fibre technology to remove fine dust on hard floors , and has stiff nylon bristles to agitate and clean carpets			0

rumours the company was working on a robotic vacuum cleaner gathered pace earlier this year when researchers at @entity266 announced a £ 5 million tie - up focusing on the technology			2
@entity0 said the @entity20 , known until now as @entity269 , followed £ 28 million worth of research and development by a team of more than 200 @entity0 engineers			0
@entity274 , probability theory , geometry and trigonometry was used to create the ‘ eye ’ of the machine , and 31 software engineers took more than 100,000 hours to create the navigation system			0
the machine has 20 to 30 minutes of battery life and manoeuvres around on tank - like tracks that can take it over small obstacles			2
it also detects objects and avoids obstacles ahead using proximity and infrared sensors @entity0 's robotic vacuum cleaner enters a market currently dominated by @entity295 ( pictured ) which makes circular autonomous cleaners			0
this i - robot @entity299 model costs £ 360			2
by comparison , the @entity5 is expected to cost in the region of £ 750 when it goes on sale in @entity8 next summer			2

the £ 750 @entity306 ’s panoramic lens features 360 ° vision
live cameras capture 30 images a second to build a picture of the room
it then uses mapping software to plot its route around the house , and sensors stop it from bumping into obstacles
' tank tracks ' mean it can move between different floor types easily
digital motor spins at *78,000* @entity212 - the highest suction of any robot vacuum
owners can also remotely control the eye with a smartphone app
