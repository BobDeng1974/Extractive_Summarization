he usually keeps his @entity2 work backstage			2
but a @entity4 lookalike accountant saw his experience at the @entity2 take a very public turn sunday night - after he was dragged onstage and ribbed by host @entity7			1
@entity8 , a boss at @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , is one of just two people trusted with the secret of who has won the coveted awards before the results are announced to the world , which he stashes away in a locked briefcase			2
' has anyone ever told you ? ' @entity7 brought @entity8 on - stage to point out that he looks like @entity4 laughing it off : the red - faced accountant did n't have a ready reply for @entity7 's ribbing this year , however , he was given an extra job - to guard the key to a second briefcase containing @entity7 's predictions for how the 87th @entity2 would play out			1
after the gongs had been awarded , @entity8 was brought out by @entity7 , who grilled him on his job as guardian of the @entity2 secrets			1
it was then he dropped the surprise line : ' anyone ever tell you , you look just like @entity4 ? ' , seizing on the uncanny resemblance			0

they then tally up the votes in their pile - but do n't know the winners as they have n't seen all the votes			0
their results are then passed on to @entity8 and @entity54 , who calculate the final total and commit the winners ' list to memory			0
later , they make two identical briefcases filled with the winning envelopes , which are locked and kept under armed guard until the night itself , a process which has been refined over the 81 years @entity9 has been in charged of the process			0
however , seizing the spotlight , for however short a time , was never part of the playbook .			0
