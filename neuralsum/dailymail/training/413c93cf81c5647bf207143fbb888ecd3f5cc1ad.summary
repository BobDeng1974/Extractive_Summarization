by @entity0 published : 07:12 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 08:32 est , 27 march 2013 an angler hooked two fish for the price of one when he caught a monster pike that had a 4ft long eel in its mouth			1
the greedy pike was in the middle of devouring the long slippery eel when he went for @entity12 's plastic ' lure ' fish he was using as bait			1
the veteran angler realised something felt very odd about the catch but was shocked when the two fish emerged from the water			1
this big : angler @entity12 was left stunned when he hooked two fish for the price of one when he caught a monster pike that had a large eel in its mouth the pike spat out the perfectly intact , but dead eel on the bank and mr @entity12 , 66 , weighed it at 4lb 8ozs - 1lb heavier than his own personal best for an eel			1
he weighed and photographed the 17lb pike before returning it to the water safe and well			0
mr @entity12 , a professional angler , had been filming a new type of bait when the extraordinary catch occurred at @entity35 in @entity36			1
mr @entity12 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , said : ' i have been fishing for as long as i can remember and this is one of the most amazing things i have ever seen			1
' i had just started when i hooked this pike			0
' it did n't feel quite right from the start , sort of like i had hooked a plastic bag under the water			2
i do n't think the pike put up much of a fight because it was concentrating on the eel			2
' i could n't believe it when the pike broke the surface and had this eel in its throat			2
the lure was lodged down inside the pike 's jaw and one of the hooks had latched onto the eel			2
' @entity62 eating eels is not unusual but it is very rare indeed to catch one hanging out of its mouth			1
' they normally quietly digest them over a number of days so it is very unusual for a pike to take a bait while eating something else			0
' it would have been just sitting at the bottom of the lake quietly enjoying its meal when it saw the bait and decided to go for that as well			0
it must have just been greedy			0
' when the temperatures are low like they are at the moment the eels get quite lethargic , so this one would n't have put up much of a fight			0
' despite fishing in the same lake for the last 25 years , it is the largest eel mr @entity12 has ever caught there by a pound			1
@entity88 , chief executive of the @entity89 , said pikes have massive appetites.and one of the joys of angling is when unexpected things like this happen			0
' @entity62 are known for their appetite and will try and eat all sorts of other fish			1
i 've never seen one eat an eel before but it does n't surprise me , ' he said			2
' they 'll eat small ducks , mice that fall into the water and frogs as well			0
' they are savage predators and it is one of the great attractions of fishing for pike			0
a small pike eats three times its body weight in two days and they go after anything that moves			0
