not many university lessons can claim to be as exciting as the one that took place at @entity4 last night			1
in a 10 - minute telescope workshop , undergraduates spotted one of the nearest supernovas to @entity9 to be seen in recent decades			2
the fluke discovery took the form of a bright light in @entity13 ( @entity13 ) - also known as the @entity13 - about 12 million light years away			1
students and staff at @entity17 s teaching observatory , the @entity18 , have spotted one of the closest supernova to @entity9 in recent decades			1
the supernova in @entity13 is shown in the bottom image next to the white markers positioned between the @entity25 and the @entity26 , the supernova can be spotted with anyone with binoculars in the @entity29 over the next few days			1
the find has been described as a ‘ @entity31 ’ for scientists and could help them unlock secrets about dark matter and how galaxies form			1
‘ one minute we ’re eating pizza then five minutes later we ’ve helped to discover a supernova , ’ said student @entity37			1
‘ i could n’t believe it			2
it reminds me why i got interested in astronomy in the first place			0
’ news of the supernova spread swiftly thanks @entity47 , with professional astronomers comparing observations to help themselves understand its significance @entity51 82 ( also known as @entity13 , @entity13 or @entity13 ) is the nearby starburst galaxy about 12 million light - years away in the constellation @entity54 composite image of the nearby @entity13 shows @entity57 data of starbursts in blue a supernova happens where there is a change in the core , or centre , of a star			1
a change can occur in two different ways			0
the first type of supernova happens in binary star systems			2
binary stars are two stars that orbit the same point			0
one of the stars , a carbon - oxygen white dwarf , steals matter from its companion star			2
eventually , the white dwarf accumulates too much matter			2
having too much matter causes the star to explode			2
the second type of supernova occurs at the end of a single star ’s lifetime			2
as the star runs out of nuclear fuel , some of its mass flows into its core			0
eventually , the core is so heavy that it can not withstand its own gravitational force			0
the core collapses , which results in the giant explosion of a supernova			2
at 7.20pm last night dr @entity100 , who was leading the workshop , spotted the exploding star in @entity13			1
‘ the weather was closing in , with increasing cloud , ’ dr @entity100 said , ‘ so instead of the planned practical astronomy class , i gave the students an introductory demonstration of how to use the ccd camera on one of the observatory ’s automated 0.35 – metre telescopes			1
’ the students chose @entity13 , a bright and photogenic galaxy as their target , as it was in one of the shrinking patches of clear sky			1
while adjusting the telescope ’s position , dr @entity100 noticed a ‘ star ’ overlaid on the galaxy which he did not recognise from previous observations			1
the group inspected online archive images of the galaxy , and it became apparent that there was indeed a new star - like object in @entity13			0
with clouds closing in , time was running out , so the team switched to taking a rapid series of one and two minute exposures through different coloured filters			0
this helped them check that the object persisted , and they were able to measure its brightness and colour			0
news of the supernova spread swiftly thanks @entity47 , with professional astronomers comparing observations to help themselves understand its significance			0
one of @entity4 's two 0.35 - metre @entity147 telescopes			0
these were used to find the supernova in @entity13 meanwhile , the team at @entity4 started up a second telescope to obtain a second source of data			0
by about 7:40 pm gmt , the cloud cover was almost complete , but it was just possible to make out the new object in the second data set			0
the supernova is one of the nearest to be observed in recent decades			0
the closest by far since the invention of the telescope was @entity162 in february 1987 , located at a distance of 168 000 light years			1
this discovery is more distant at around 12 million light years , about the same as the 1993 discovery of a supernova in nearby @entity167			1
‘ the chances of finding anything new in the sky is astronomical but this was particularly astounding as it was one of the first images we had taken on this telescope , ’ said student @entity168			1
‘ my career plan had been to continue my studies in astrophysics			0
its going to be hard to ever top this though			0

supernova was found last night in a galaxy 12 million light years away
it can be spotted with binoculars in @entity29 in next few days
the fluke discovery is described as a ‘ @entity31 ’ for scientists and could help them unlock secrets about dark matter and how galaxies form
