airlines are claiming that an ‘ unprecedented ’ it failure at the @entity10 ’s national air traffic control centre – which threw the travel plans of 120,000 people into chaos – was ‘ beyond their control ’			1

a spokesman for the airline @entity23 said last night that passengers were entitled to refunds or free rebooking of flights , but added : ‘ as this is an exceptional circumstance , compensation does not apply			2
’ and a @entity29 spokeswoman said : ‘ yesterday ’s events were outside of @entity29 ’ control			2
‘ we will be investigating two things : firstly what went wrong , how it happened and how it can be stopped ; and secondly , how passengers were treated – whether they were given enough information and looked after properly			0
’ friday ’s chaos continued to have a knock - on effect yesterday with 54 flights cancelled at @entity51 and @entity52			0
following an urgent investigation at its £ 700million headquarters yesterday , a spokesman for @entity54 – the company in charge of @entity10 air traffic control – revealed that the problem had been caused when part of a computer system holding flight path data became overloaded			2
this led it to shut down unexpectedly at 3.27pm on friday			0
while air traffic controllers at the base in @entity69 , @entity70 , could still communicate with pilots and track planes in the sky , they could no longer see what altitude or route each aircraft was scheduled to take – forcing airspace over @entity78 to be shut down for 40 minutes			0
‘ it has never happened before – it ’s something completely new , ’ the spokesman said last night as engineers continued to investigate the problem			0

‘ @entity6 rules around compensation only apply to the airlines so if it ’s a problem that is beyond their control then consumers wo n’t get any money beyond hotel and food expenses			1
’ transport secretary @entity110 , who described the disruption as ‘ unacceptable ’ , will be questioned on the issue when he appears before the @entity37 tomorrow			0
this weekend ’s problems came a year after a telephone failure at @entity54 ’ control room also caused huge disruption – one of a number of technical hitches to hit the part - privatised operation since its @entity69 centre opened in 2002 .			1
