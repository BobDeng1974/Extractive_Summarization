they got married five years ago after mr @entity19 was told he might not survive an operation to replace a defective aortic valve in his heart			1
he pulled through but said his new wife soon spoke of divorce and has now accused him of being a womaniser who drinks too much , claims he denies			0
the couple rose to fame in the 1990s when tv programmes were made about the thousands of nudist visitors who flocked to their manor and its beautiful gardens the couple wrap up in fur while showing off their book - the naked gardeners speaking today , mr @entity19 said : ' eleven weeks after we got married @entity10 suggested that maybe it would be a good idea if we had a controlled separation and divorce - that was the first suggestion for it			1
i do n't know what brought that thing on			0
' he said mrs @entity10 soon moved into another area of the house but the marriage continued until last july when she attended a course at @entity82 on ' family healing '			1
he added : ' after coming back she walked out on me , the three kids - who are 18 , 22 , and 27 - and her own mother , who is 89 and lives in a flat upstairs			0

when asked the reason for the split , he said : ' i 'm a womanising alcoholic [ according to divorce papers ]			0
to all parties concerned it is " where the hell did she dream that one up "			0
' to call me a womaniser is ludicrous			0
also an alcoholic - i like drinking like 80 or 90 per cent of the country			0
her idea is that you should n't drink at all , you should abstain from alcohol completely			0
' she also said i left the marital bed , but she was the one that moved			0
' mr @entity19 said he did not want to sell the home , but could not afford to buy out her share of the property , which is expected to go for ' quite a lot ' in the coming weeks			1

we have brought different skills to the development of @entity43 and its gardens , which it has been a privilege to participate in			0
' however i am not getting any younger , i will not last forever and i believe it is time to let someone else create a new chapter here			0
i wish to continue my interest in gardening , approach it in a different way and grow food among the flowers			0
' @entity27 has attracted nearly half a million visitors since it opened its doors in 1998			2

the couple 's fame grew when they later unearthed the skeleton of a 12th century monk in the tulip beds			1
but after just five years of marriage , mrs @entity10 recently left and the home and gardens are now set to go on the market in the coming weeks			1
the pending sale is likely to spell the end of the road for the medieval town 's naked tourists and locals fear the treasured garden could be shut to the public			2
mr @entity19 added : ' as well as the personal issues , there is an added impact on the gardens and the town , so i believe people deserve an explanation			1
' we have 20 people here who are either employed or volunteer , and @entity27 are a big draw for the town			2
locals now fear the lovingly looked - after gardens may be closed off to the public or allowed to go back to their former overgrown state the beautiful tulip borders to the some of the garden 's lawns are among the many wonderful features which have attracted so many visitors ' the house and the gardens will be going on the market in the next few weeks but we have agreed that any sale will not impact on this season , so we will stay open until october as usual			2
' but there will obviously be no guarantee that whoever buys @entity43 will want to keep it open			0
' we are constantly described by visitors as being much better than @entity203 or @entity204 or @entity205 , and some describe us as one of the best gardens in the world			0
' it would be lovely if they did see that they could open up the gardens to the public and get an income which covers the expenses of keeping the garden , but who knows ? ' @entity15 's mayor @entity219 appealed for any prospective buyer to keep the gardens open			1
' @entity27 are very important to the town and has brought in a lot of people to @entity15			1
it has put the town on the map , ' she said			0
' people come to the tourist information centre and the town hall and ask ' where are the @entity0 ' and it will be a very sad loss to @entity15			2

@entity11 and @entity10 took over @entity27 in @entity9
couple then transformed the @entity15 estate into a nudist attraction
couple 's dream is set to come to an end after mrs @entity10 filed for divorce
