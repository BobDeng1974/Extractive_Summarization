@entity0 says he would love to fight @entity1 in his next bout			1
the @entity4 boxer had hoped to take on @entity5 but the pound - for - pound king will instead meet @entity7 in a $ 300million mega-fight on may 2			0
and now it seems @entity0 has set his sights on facing the man dubbed by many as the new @entity5			0
@entity0 ( left ) says he 'd love to fight @entity1 after the @entity13 said he 'd be ready this month @entity1 , a former three weight world champion , won a unanimous points decision over @entity16 on saturday as he continued to rebuild his reputation after losing his undefeated record two years ago to @entity19 â€“ who then twice fought and lost to @entity5			1
so comfortable was the @entity16 fight for @entity1 that on tuesday he said he would be ready to face @entity0 ' at the end of this month '			1
writing on @entity22 , @entity1 said : ' no disrespect to @entity24 he is a great coach and i got endless love for him but me and @entity0 can fight at the end of this month i have n't taken any punishment i 'm back in the gym and ready to make a fool out of anybody # @entity30 # @entity32 ' @entity0 appeared to laugh off @entity1 's claims on @entity34 before going on to tweet : ' would love to fight @ @entity35 next ! # @entity36 lets make it happen			1
' @entity1 won a unanimous points decision on saturday but says he copped little punishment and is in the gym on monday , @entity1 even suggested he would be prepared to come to @entity41 to fight @entity0			1
' i ca n't wait			0
i 'd even fight him at @entity42 , ' @entity1 told @entity43			0
last year @entity5 hit back at @entity0 's claims he was running scared and told him to prove his credentials by beating @entity1 on the undercard of his first fight with @entity19			2
@entity5 hit back at @entity0 's claims he was running scared but chose to fight @entity7 @entity5 tweeted : ' i do n't have an easy fight on may 3 , 2014 , so i ca n't overlook @ @entity49 but @ @entity50 , if you and @ @entity35 end up fighting each other on my show and you win ( which you wo n't ) ... i 'll fight you			2
' the fight never materialised then with @entity0 instead going on to beat @entity56 and then @entity57			0
but with no opponent named for his next fight , the proposition of fighting @entity1 may now appeal to @entity0 .			0

@entity1 said he can fight @entity0 as soon as the end of the month after defeating @entity16 by a unanimous points decision on saturday
' @entity65 *responded* on @entity34 saying he ' would love to fight ' him next
@entity0 hoped to fight @entity5 but the undefeated champion chose to take on @entity7 in a $ 300m *megafight* in may
now @entity1 , a former three weight world champion , is a *genuine* *prospect*
