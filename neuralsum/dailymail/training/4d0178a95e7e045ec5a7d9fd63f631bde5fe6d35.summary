by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 former @entity4 goalkeeper @entity3 believes @entity5 may decide to leave @entity6 in january if he fails to win back his first - team spot			1
@entity5 has had to make do with a spot on the substitutes ' bench during @entity4 's first two games of the season as @entity13 has instead opted to start with @entity14 in goal			1
and @entity3 , who lost his place to @entity5 during his time in west @entity18 , has tipped his former rival to become disillusioned with life at @entity4 if he continues to be overlooked by @entity13			1
i was the no 1 for three years when @entity5 arrived but i did n’t have the same pedigree @entity5 has now			2
' he can go anywhere			0
any team in the world will take him but it was different for me			0
a goalkeeper of his calibre will try to win the no 1 jersey back but if @entity14 does his job well and keeps it , then i do n’t think that @entity5 will stay			2
' it might be in january , it might be the end of the year but i do n’t see him staying			0
that ’s my idea but i might be wrong			0
' valuable advice : @entity3 , pictured with @entity5 in 2005 , believes the @entity45 international is too good to sit on @entity4 's bench			1

@entity3 lost his place to @entity5 during his time at @entity6
@entity14 has started @entity4 's first two league games of the season
@entity13 has opted to start with @entity14 *due* to his *youthfulness*
