@entity0 and @entity1 have been two of the stars of this magnificent tournament , but while one of them could go on to be a national icon , the other will be going home early			1
if friday 's match between @entity10 and @entity11 is settled by anybody , it will most likely be one of these two with a piece of football magic			1
at @entity47 he ’s like a little boy , playing in the shadow of @entity50			0
at this tournament , with the weight of an entire nation on his shoulders , he has been majestic			2
we all know about @entity0 ’s skill but i have been surprised by his work ethic			2
i have never seen a footballer walk about the pitch as much as @entity50 but he gets away with it because of his genius			0
with @entity0 , it ’s more of an all - action display			1
he is always on the move , playing up front , off the striker , out wide			0
he gives everything for his team in attack and defence and at times has almost been like their captain			0
plenty to shout about : @entity0 celebrates with @entity74 after scoring his side 's first goal against @entity77 scare : @entity0 has been nursing knee and thigh injuries which have occasionally flared up during the tournament king of the dribble : @entity0 is second only to @entity50 in the leaderboard of dribble attempts at the @entity23			1
source : @entity86 @entity1 is a more languid , laid - back player			1
he has the perfect build for a footballer with great footballing intelligence , too			0
his volley against @entity91 was one of the goals of the tournament			2
he demonstrated his awareness before the ball came to him by having two quick looks over his shoulder to find the space			0
it ’s that extra time on the ball that marks out great players			0
it normally takes years to build that kind of confidence so to see it in one as young as @entity1 — he ’s only 22 — is special and to be a goal ahead of @entity50 , @entity0 and @entity108 at the @entity23 is exceptional			1
he and @entity0 are both brilliant to watch			2
let ’s hope they put on one last show tonight before one of them has to go home			0
conversion rate : @entity1 has scored with 62.5 per cent of his efforts during the @entity23 so far			1
source : @entity86 dancing feet : @entity1 ( no 10 ) leads his team in some fancy moves after scoring against the @entity121 delighted : @entity1 is pleased as punch after scoring one of his five goals for @entity11 unforgettable : @entity1 scores with a stunning volley in the last - 16 encounter with @entity91 , the goal of the tournament so far beaten : the ball flies past @entity91 goalkeeper @entity131 and in off the crossbar video @entity133 : @entity134			1

@entity23 *quarter* - final set to be *battle* between @entity0 of @entity10 and @entity1 of @entity11
@entity0 is the all - action hero who has carried the burden of the host nation with four goals
@entity1 is the more laid - back , intelligent *playmaker* who scored one of the goals of the tournament
