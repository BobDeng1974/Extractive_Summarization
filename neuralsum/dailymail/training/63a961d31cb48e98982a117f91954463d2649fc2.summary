this is the *equivalent* of about 12 level teaspoons a day
now , experts say halving this could have *additional* health benefits
guideline amount slashed amid fears sugar poses same threat as tobacco
they say 5 **%** , or six teaspoons , is the ideal figure that people should aim for
@entity52 suggest it would impose a maximum limit on sugar , fat and salt in products marketed at children
