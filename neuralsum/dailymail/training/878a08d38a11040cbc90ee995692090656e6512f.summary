former @entity1 marketing chief @entity0 criticised the organising committee for ‘ scoring an own goal ’ over exclusivity rights			1
he said that the over-zealous rules are ‘ suffocating local street traders ’ , in the light of critics dubbing @entity18 2012 the ‘ @entity11 ’			1
mr @entity0 added that guidelines were ‘ never intended to shut down the flower shop that put its flowers in @entity6 rings in the window ’			1
he told the @entity24 : ‘ the controls and protections have gone too far when it is starting to suffocate local street traders and i do n’t think that is necessarily what the @entity6 sponsors are looking for			0
‘ the public do get it			0
they do understand that @entity34 has paid , @entity35 has n’t , so @entity34 should be entitled to provide the soft drinks			2
but what ’s that got to do with a flaming torch baguette in a café ? ’ mr @entity0 was behind revolutionary sponsorship deals that he claims saved the @entity43 from dying out in the 1980s			2
mr @entity0 ’s comments were echoed by @entity18 mayor @entity45 , who warned against ‘ insanity ’ when it came to policing usage of the five interlocking rings			1
mr @entity45 told @entity50 : ‘ if you want to stick five doughnuts in your window and call them @entity6 rings , then be my guest			0
’ it came after @entity58 hit out at the negative headlines which have dogged the countdown to the @entity43 , insisting organisers were on course to deliver a successful games			1
@entity58 , who is chairman of the organising committee @entity64 , said people were ‘ overwhelmingly very positive ’ about the @entity11 , despite concerns over security , transport and strict sponsorship rules			1
staying positive : both @entity45 and @entity58 have continued to talk up the positives of the @entity11 and @entity45 echoed concerns saying blocking usage of the logo was insanity draconian : a florist in @entity75 was ordered to take down this @entity6 - themed window display after being warned she was breaching copyright laws ‘ there are things we have done really well , ’ he insisted , referring to praise he had received from athletes and the international media about the facilities built for @entity84			1
in an interview on @entity90 ’s today programme yesterday , @entity58 defended the @entity11 organisers from claims that there had been a heavy - handed approach to protecting sponsors ’ rights			1
today presenter @entity97 asked @entity58 whether he would be allowed to turn up to an event in a @entity35 t - shirt			1
lord @entity100 said : ‘ no , you probably would n’t be walking in with a @entity35 t - shirt because @entity34 are our sponsors and they have put millions of pounds into this project but also millions of pounds into grassroots sport			1
it is important to protect those sponsors			0
’ hours after his interview on today , @entity64 said @entity6 ticket - holders would be ‘ free to wear the clothing of their choice ’ inside @entity11 venues , despite his earlier comment			1
pride : the bagels were put up ahead of the olympic torch relay , which will pass by at the weekend the run up to the @entity119 has seen organisers coming down hard on anyone they deem to be breaching the strict brand protection rules			1
last week a cafe manager in @entity124 , south @entity18 was raided by ‘ community wardens ’ after he displayed five bagels in the style of the @entity43 rings in his window			0
two ‘ community wardens ’ swooped on the @entity130 , in @entity124 , within 20 minutes of manager @entity131 putting up the display			0
they claimed that putting the circular buns on show breached copyright rules			2
one customer said : ‘ they were being quite aggressive to @entity131 , ordering him to take them down immediately and threatening him with court and fines			0
they said there would be very serious consequences if he did not obey them			0
‘ it was just some bread hanging in a window , for goodness sake ! when a few customers such as myself started telling them off for being silly , they began taking pictures of us on their camera , which i found sinister			0
' in may a florist from @entity75 was ordered to take down a tissue paper window display of the rings she had put up to mark the the olympic torch relay due passing through her town			2
trading standards officials warned her that the rings constituted an ‘ unauthorised use ’ of the @entity6 logo and left her at risk of being sued by @entity11 organisers			1
@entity170 , 33 , said at the time : ‘ the trading standards officers said they really loved the display , but told us we ’d have to take it down or we could be sued			0
' we ’ve only been running the shop for 16 months			0
i could n’t fight it against them , they are a big organisation			0
i ’m trying to grow my business , not ruin it			0
’ ‘ i had no idea i was breaking any rules			2
i just wanted to support @entity184 and the @entity43			0
' a spokesman for @entity11 organiser @entity64 said : ‘ wherever @entity64 or trading standards officers see unauthorised use of the word “ @entity43 ” or registered trademarks , we will take the time to explain to the business owner why they can not do that			2
’ he added : ‘ in general we will pursue a course of education , rather than litigation			0
last year @entity201 , manager of @entity6 in @entity202 was forced to change the name of his business to @entity205 after being warned he could face legal action over the use of the word .			2
