by @entity0 a big drop in customer complaints helped @entity4 airlines post their best ratings ever even though more flights were late and more bags were mishandled , according to a report released monday by university researchers			1
@entity10 topped the ratings , and three regional airlines scored at the bottom			1
among the four biggest airlines , @entity14 ranked best followed by @entity16 , @entity4 and @entity17 , according to researchers from @entity19 and @entity20			1
tired of complaining ? fewer customer complaints helped @entity4 airlines post their best ratings ever even though more flights were late and more bags were mishandled the researchers have graded airlines since 1991 on government figures for on - time performance , mishandled bags , bumping passengers , and complaints filed with the @entity4 @entity31			1
their key findings : @entity33 : @entity34 operated 78.4 percent of their flights on time in 2013 , down from 81.8 percent in 2012			0
best : @entity34 ; worst : @entity37			2
only two airlines improved : @entity39 and @entity17			1
bag handling : the rate of lost , stolen or delayed bags rose 5 percent			0
best : @entity10 ; worst : @entity37			1
@entity43 : the rate of bumping passengers from flights fell 8 percent			0
best : @entity47 ; worst : @entity48			0
complaints : consumer complaints to the government dropped 15 percent in 2013 after rising 20 percent the year before			1
best : @entity16 ; worst : frontier			2
the best : for the second year in a row , @entity10 tops the list of the nation 's best airlines 1 ) @entity10 2 ) @entity47 3 ) @entity34 @entity14 5 ) @entity56 6 ) @entity57 7 ) @entity58 8 ) @entity16 9 ) @entity4 10 ) @entity59 11 ) @entity60 12 ) @entity17 13 ) @entity61 14 ) @entity48 15 ) @entity37 one of the report 's authors , @entity19 business professor @entity62 , credited the drop in complaints partly to @entity17			1
the company suffered several computer - network outages and grounded hundreds of flights in 2012 when it combined the @entity17 and @entity71 computer networks after a merger , but " got their act together " in 2013 , he said			2
@entity62 said the drop in complaints might also reflect ' a certain amount of resignation ' that ' it 's never wonderful for airline passengers			2
' it 's not clear that the researchers captured the mood of travelers			0
no matter how much people gripe about airlines , very few of the millions of fliers ever bother to file a complaint with the government			0
the @entity31 , or @entity31 , received just 9,684 complaints last year after getting 11,447 in 2012			0
@entity90 , ceo of @entity91 and not involved in the academic report , said he believes that most consumers complain directly to the airlines instead			0
' the @entity31 ca n't comp you miles or comp you a voucher — only the airlines can do that , ' @entity90 said			0
' a passenger might not think to file with @entity31			0
' the worst : @entity37 has dropped from the 11 spot to 15 , making it the worst of the nation 's 15 airlines luggage : the the rate of lost , stolen or delayed bags rose 5 percent			1
@entity10 received the highest rating most of the worst grades — from late flights and lost bags to bumping passengers off planes — were earned by smaller regional airlines			2
in the overall standings , @entity37 , the regional affiliate of @entity39 , finished last , just ahead of @entity48 and @entity61 , which operate regional flights for @entity17 and @entity14			1
regional airlines fly smaller planes , their flights are the first to be canceled in bad weather , and they operate at smaller airports that might lack the maintenance capability of bigger airports			0
however , they have become critical to the so - called hub - and - spoke system that @entity17 , @entity4 and @entity14 use to connect passengers to flights at big ' hub ' airports			1
' if you have hubs , you need spokes or the wheel does n't work , ' @entity62 said .			0

@entity37 took the 15th spot , dropping from 11 in 2012
