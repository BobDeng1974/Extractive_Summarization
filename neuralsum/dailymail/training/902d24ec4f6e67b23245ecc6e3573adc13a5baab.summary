by @entity0 the @entity1 has lavished more than £ 10million on consultants in the past year			2
its total consultancy bill doubled in just 12 months as executives spent thousands of pounds on personal ‘ advisers ’ from firms such as @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
but despite awarding hundreds of contracts - at huge expense to licence fee payers - the corporation refused to provide any details of what they were hired to do			1
' not an easy ride ' : director - general @entity18 promised to tighten spending on consultants just last month - but the cost to the @entity1 has increased figures released under the @entity23 show the @entity1 paid a total of £ 10.4million to external consultants in the financial year up to march			1
the bill in 2011/12 was £ 5million			0
the five biggest recipients were @entity8 , @entity7 , @entity9 , @entity28 and @entity29			0
only last month director - general @entity18 promised to reduce spending on consultants			1
he told the @entity31 : ‘ i want to reduce the amount of money that we pay on consultants , i really do			2
i am not an easy ride when it comes to consultants			0
’ but the @entity1 is already on course to rack up another huge bill this financial year , spending £ 4.7million in the six months between april , when @entity18 took up his role , and september			1
last night @entity42 , chairman of the commons public accounts committee , threatened to drag @entity18 to the @entity44 to explain the enormous bill in person			1
she said : ‘ this is public money			2
you ’ve got to account for it properly			0
they better have a jolly good explanation for why they need so much consultancy in an organisation that is slimming down on management anyway			0
‘ they have to say what the consultants were hired to do			0
they ca n’t carry on with this secrecy			0
’ in the past two years , 22 divisions of the corporation – including the @entity62 , the human resources department and the finance team – have employed the help of management consultants			2
the corporation refused to release details of what projects any of the consultancy firms were hired for , or how much each was paid			0
@entity7 alone earned £ 5.7million in @entity1 fees between january and august this year , it emerged yesterday			0
it is thought much of the recent increase in consultancy fees has been driven by senior executives hiring external advisers to help them do their jobs rather than rely on the @entity1 ’s own staff			1
it is believed the @entity1 ’s £ 300,000 - a - year director of operations , @entity82 , employs a @entity7 consultant as his ‘ chief adviser ’			1
in september , the @entity1 ’s £ 295,000 - a - year strategy chief @entity85 was criticised for recruiting former @entity87 spin chief @entity86 to provide pr advice			1
the @entity1 already had 140 staff in its pr department with a salary bill of around £ 5million			0
@entity93 mp @entity92 , who sits on the @entity94 , said the consultancies ’ bill was a ‘ staggering waste of money ’			1
he added : ‘ it is an extraordinary , unnecessary bill			0
we have a new director - general appointed with a clear mandate to draw a line under the past and get a grip			1
‘ he has recruited a team of hand - picked managers who he says are the best people to sort out the @entity1 ’s problems , and they are paid hundreds of thousands of pounds a year			2
‘ why , if this phalanx of managers are so good , ca n’t they do their jobs without the help of external consultants ? ’ a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity1 in common with other large organisations does employ consultants when we need specialist advice and guidance on projects that are outside of the normal course of our business and where it would not be cost - efficient to maintain these specialist skills in - house .			0

corporation has doubled its spending on advisers in just one year
the increase comes after director - general @entity18 promised to spend less
it has been described as ' a staggering waste of money '
