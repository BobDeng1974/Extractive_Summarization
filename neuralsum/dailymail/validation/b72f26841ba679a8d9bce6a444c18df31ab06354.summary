stars generate sounds on their surface in an unexpected way , according to new experimental evidence			0
of course , as space is a vacuum it is impossible to hear sound in space , but the discovery reveals a new way that fluids can interact to produce a sound - one with an extremely high frequency			1
the discovery was made by a team of scientists including dr @entity18 of the @entity19 in the @entity20			2
a team of scientists that included @entity22 made the discovery			1
they fired an ultra-intense laser on fluids in a laboratory			1
when they did this , the plasma in the fluid produced a sound wave			1
this process is thought to also be taking place in stars ( sun pictured ) they found that , when material - dust or gas from nearby - falls onto a star , it can produce an extremely high pitched sound in the plasma			1
dr @entity18 told @entity45 that the phenomenon is ' more common in younger stars ' that are still accumulating material from their surroundings			0
it would be less common in more mature stars , like our sun. to make the finding , the team studied fluids in motion in a laboratory and found that , when plasma is hit with an ultra-intense laser , it produces some strange effects			1
using a method not too dissimilar to how a speed camera works , they were able to observe how the fluid moves at the point it is struck			0
often called the fourth state of matter , plasma is a state of matter where heat or another energy has been added to a gas			0
this makes many of its atoms release some , or all , of their electrons			0
the resultant electrically charged gas is said to be ‘ ionised ’ , and when enough atoms are ionised , the gas is said to be a plasma			0
interestingly , plasma is thought to make up more than 99 per cent of all matter in the universe			2
a trillionth of a second after the laser hits , plasma was found to flow quickly from areas of high density to low density			2
in so doing , the plasma between the regions of different density produces pressure pulses , or a sound wave			1
however , with a frequency of nearly a trillion hertz , the sound wave produced is six million times higher in frequency than anything that can be heard by a mammal			1
it is also almost the highest frequency possible in such a material			0
according to the scientists , a prime location for this rare event occurring is on the surface of stars			2
the process is thought to be taking place on stars like the sun , pictured , where plasma is in abundance			1
in fact , plasma is thought to make up 99 per cent of matter in the universe ‘ when they are accumulating new material , stars could generate sound in a very similar manner to that which we observed in the laboratory - so the stars might be singing - but , since sound can not propagate through the vacuum of space , no - one can hear them , ’ said dr @entity18			1
however , he noted that it would be difficult to directly observe this effect in stars , as the sound waves do not propagate into the space around the star			2
‘ it was initially hard to determine the origin of the acoustic signals , but our model produced results that compared favourably with the wavelength shifts observed in the experiment , ’ added dr @entity141 , from the @entity142 at the @entity144 ’s @entity143 in @entity145			0
‘ this showed that we had discovered a new way of generating sound from fluid flows			0
similar situations could occur in plasma flowing around stars			0
’ the research , published in @entity161 , was funded by the @entity162 and the @entity163 .			0

however , as space is a vacuum , you would *n't* hear anything if nearby
