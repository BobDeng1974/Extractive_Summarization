by @entity1 reporter published : 15:22 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 16:32 est , 9 january 2013 unexpected : gun violence and obesity are two of the top factors that cause @entity6 to have a lower life expectancy than other wealthy nations the @entity6 has far more violent deaths than any other wealthy nation in part because there are so many residents who own guns and store them in unlocked places in their homes			1
the lax gun rules are a major contributor to the low life expectancy rate that @entity6 have compared to their global counterparts			1
a new report reveals that of the 17 wealthiest countries , @entity6 males have the lowest life expectancy of 75.6 years and their female counterparts are the second lowest in the rankings coming in at 80.7 years			1
the blame placed on guns comes just weeks after the horrific shooting at @entity31 and as politicians make calls for stricter gun controls			0
the @entity6 has about six violent deaths per 100,000 residents and none of the 16 other countries included in the review came anywhere close to that ratio			2
@entity41 was closest to the @entity6 ranking with slightly more than two violent deaths per 100,000 residents			1
' with lives and dollars at stake , the @entity6 can not afford to ignore this problem , ' said the report from the @entity47 and the @entity48			1
the researchers said there is little evidence that violent acts occur more frequently in the @entity6 than elsewhere			2
it 's the lethality of those attacks that stands out			0
‘ one behavior that probably explains the excess lethality of violence and unintentional injuries in the @entity6 is the widespread possession of firearms and the common practice of storing them ( often unlocked ) at home			0
the statistics are dramatic , ’ the report said			0
for example , the @entity6 has the highest rate of firearm ownership among peer countries — 89 civilian - owned firearms for every @entity73 , and the @entity6 is home to about 35 to 50 per cent of the world 's civilian - owned firearms , the report noted			2
@entity76 is taking a renewed look at gun legislation , but the researchers said in a conference call they were just as concerned about factors that have nothing to do with guns , such as the high prevalence of illness among teenagers and young adults			0
taking action : vice president @entity89 met with the committee that is debating possible ways to tighten gun control throughout the country in the wake of the @entity31 massacre global : though all of the wealthier countries throughout the world have high life expectancies , but @entity6 's rate has been going down throughout the years because of health problems while 2012 was a particularly shocking year in terms of mass shootings - with the movie theatre shooting in @entity107 , @entity108 that left 12 people dead and 58 injured , and more recently 26 people were killed at the @entity31 , @entity103 massacre - americans have been dying younger than their global counterparts for years			1
in addition to the impact of gun violence , @entity6 consume the most calories among peer countries and get involved in more accidents that involve alcohol			2
slight improvement : though the @entity6 life expectancy rate does not match up well world - wide , it does show an increase compared to itself the @entity6 also suffers higher rates of drug - related deaths , infant mortality and @entity127			1
the result is that the life expectancy for men in the @entity6 ranked the lowest among the 17 countries reviewed , at 75.6 years , while the life expectancy for @entity6 women ranked second lowest at 80.7 years			1
the other 16 countries that were reviewed in the study by two of the nation 's leading health research institutions included @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and much of @entity142			0
the nation 's health disadvantages have economic consequences as they lead to higher costs for consumers and taxpayers as well as a workforce that remains less healthy than that of other high - income countries			0
‘ with lives and dollars at stake , the @entity6 can not afford to ignore this problem , ’ said the report from the @entity47 and the @entity48			1
in attempting to explain why @entity6 are so unhealthy , the researchers looked at three categories : the nation 's health care system , harmful behaviors and social and economic conditions			0
researchers noted that the @entity6 has a large uninsured population compared to other countries with comparable economies , and more limited access to primary care			0
and although the income of @entity6 is higher on average than that of other wealthy countries , the @entity6 also has a higher level of poverty , especially among children .			0

@entity177 gun security and poor *healthcare* contribute to low @entity6 ranking
life expectancy for men ranked the lowest with only 75.6 years and @entity6 women came in at second lowest with 80.7 years
report comes from the @entity47 and @entity48
