by @entity0 published : 12:19 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 05:49 est , 15 september 2013 an accidental discovery has led to the creation of the world ’s thinnest sheet of glass - at just one molecule thick			2
the ‘ pane ’ of glass is so impossibly thin that its individual silicon and oxygen atoms are clearly visible using a microscope			1
the discovery may someday lead to a defect - free , ultra-thin material that could improve the performance of processors in computers and smartphones			0
professor @entity17 ( right ) and graduate student @entity18 ( left ) are holding a structural model of the world 's thinnest pane of glass , which is actually a 100 million times thinner in real life the glass was identified by chance in the lab of @entity17 , professor of applied and engineering physics at @entity30			1
professor @entity17 had been making graphene , a two - dimensional sheet of carbon atoms , in a chicken wire crystal formation			1
he noticed some ‘ muck ’ on the graphene , and when he took a closer look , found it to be made up of the elements of everyday glass ; silicon and oxygen			1
‘ when the first images came up on the computer screen we were just blown away , ’ he told @entity44			0
a picture of the atoms in the glass taken with our electron microscope , which is one of the most powerful in the world			1
the brightest dots are silicon @entity57 has always been a mystery			0
the problem , for years , was that scientists had no way to directly see it and so struggled to understand it			2
it behaves like a solid , but was thought to look more like a liquid			0
in 1932 @entity65 published ' @entity66 in @entity57 ' - an article that is seen as the influential piece on the science of glass			0
in it , he drew a diagram of what he thought would be the correct theoretical representation of the arrangement of atoms in glass			1
the most recent work at @entity30 , proves that mr @entity80 's theory was in fact correct			0
‘ the mystery atoms were the elements of everyday glass , silicon and oxygen			2
‘ but more amazing , their arrangement looked exactly like the cartoons proposed 81 years ago as to how atoms in a glass might be arranged so that it would be stable			1
‘ and here , for the first time , we were actually seeing that			0
’ it took the research team another year to understand how the glass might have grown			0
they concluded that an air leak had caused the copper to react with the quartz , also made of silicon and oxygen			0
this produced the glass layer on the would - be pure graphene			2
the work answers an 81 - year - old question about the structure of glass			2
the image shows the atoms in the glass overlayed by a cartoon based on the model proposed in 1932 by @entity115			1
the red dots are oxygen and the yellow dots are silicon atoms scientists , with no way to directly see it , had struggled to understand it : it behaves like a solid , but was thought to look more like a liquid			0
but what @entity30 found strikingly resembles a diagram drawn in 1932 by @entity65 – a longstanding theoretical representation of the arrangement of atoms in glass			1
‘ this is the work that , when i look back at my career , i will be most proud of , ’ said @entity17			2
‘ it 's the first time that anyone has been able to see the arrangement of atoms in a glass			1
’ the discovery was made as part of a collaboration between @entity30 and the @entity140 , and is now recorded in the @entity141 .			0

@entity17 made the finding after noticing some ' muck ' on graphene
the glass is so thin that its atoms are clearly visible under a microscope
their arrangement is exactly like the cartoons proposed 81 years ago on how atoms in glass might look
