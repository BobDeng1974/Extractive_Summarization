by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:20 pm on 25th july 2011 tough decisions : @entity3 admitted that his plans to revive the economy have not made him popular chancellor @entity3 insisted his tough deficit reduction plan has been ' vindicated ' despite fears that official figures due to be published on tuesday will show a sharp slowdown in economic growth			1
@entity11 has been turned into a ' safe harbour from the storm ' he claimed at a @entity16 press conference ahead of their publication			1
the chancellor admitted the ' very difficult decisions ' he has taken over the last year to revive the economy had not made him ' popular politically '			1
but low interest rates and the @entity11 's credit status meant they were ' justified ' , he added			2
' that has provided the stability that the @entity11 economy needs in a very , very unstable global environment			1
' the @entity27 will tomorrow publish figures on the economy over the three months to june			1
previous forecasts of 0.5 per cent growth in @entity32 were predicted by city economists to drop to 0.1 per cent or 0.2 per cent			1
the figure is subject to revision , but a poor reading would heap more pressure on mr @entity3 to come up with an alternative strategy to the government 's deficit reduction plan			2
asked if his tough economic policy , along with his involvement in the decision to hire @entity44 as @entity46 communications director , made him a ' reckless chancellor ' , mr @entity3 replied : ' i think i am taking the right decisions that anyone in my position would have to take			2
' i came into this job with @entity11 facing the largest budget deficit in the @entity54			2
there is no way you could massage those figures			2
' we have just come out of the worst banking crisis , probably in @entity11 history , and we have had the deepest recession since the 1930s			0
' we took a series of decisions early on to tackle the budget deficit and to have a credible plan in place			0
' if you want evidence of why that was the right thing to do , look at the last couple of weeks			0
' there are many @entity75 countries that in the last couple of weeks faced enormous instability because of question marks over their ability to pay their debts and deal with their budget deficits			0
' but the @entity11 , with a higher budget deficit than those countries , has not had that question mark over it			0
' indeed , our borrowing costs have come down			0
i think that is a vindication of the decisions we took			0
we turned @entity11 into a safe harbour from the storm			0
that has not been easy			0
' @entity95 visitors : @entity96 made his remarks at a press conference with @entity95 prime minister @entity99 ( left ) , which was also attended by footballer @entity100 meanwhile prime minister @entity96 today poured cold water on hopes that tax cuts or a fresh round of money - printing may be deployed to stimulate the economy , business secretary @entity107 has suggested that the @entity108 could stimulate a sluggish economy with a further injection of money through so - called ' quantitative easing ' , while chancellor @entity3 has hinted that he would like to cut taxes on business			1
but mr @entity96 insisted that there was no leeway for either fiscal stimulus through tax cuts or public spending increases , or monetary stimulus in the form of the @entity108 reducing interest rates or printing money			1
' there 's no country , really , that can afford another fiscal stimulus			0
they 've all run out of money , ' he said			0
' there is n't some great monetary stimulus you can give when interest rates are as low as they are			0
' the right step for an economy like ours is to get on top of your debt and your deficit and then make it a better place for businesses to grow and expand and employ people			1
' speaking at a 10 @entity46 press conference with his @entity95 counterpart @entity146 , mr @entity96 acknowledged that ' our path back to growth is a difficult one and has already been a difficult one '			1
but he insisted : ' i 'm confident we are taking the right steps to get on top of our debts and our deficit , to take @entity11 out of the danger zone in @entity75 , to get our economy moving			1

economists predict *gdp* will show just a 0.1 per cent rise
