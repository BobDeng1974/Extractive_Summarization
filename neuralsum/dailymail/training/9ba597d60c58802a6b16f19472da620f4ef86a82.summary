by @entity0 published : 09:11 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 09:44 est , 7 august 2013 @entity1 has a strict policy on which apps can grace the pages of its @entity5 , so it comes as no surprise that many ideas have fallen by the wayside since it opened in 2008			1
many of the applications that have been rejected have been deemed inappropriate - one game involved causing a gust of air to lift up girls ' skirts on the screen , for example			1
and while others may not have been lewd , they were either entirely bizarre or even dangerous			0
the @entity22 app , pictured , was rejected because it could be used to calculate how much radiation was being emitted by mobiles and mobile phone masts			1
@entity1 said the app could confuse users and potentially frighten them and this was irresponsible the ' mobile sports game ' send me to @entity31 , pictured , was rejected because it challenged users to throw their iphones as high into the air as possible			1
it used the device 's built - in accelerometer to determine how high into the air it is thrown , but @entity1 rejected it because it could cause damage to the devices or to the users to be accepted onto the @entity5 , apps must be functional in that they must not crash , include hidden features or work in a way other than what the developer advertised			1
they must also have a user function and developers ca n't charge for app that does n't do anything			2
any app that is defamatory , offensive , mean - spirited , or likely to place the targeted individual or group in harms way will be rejected			2
apps that present excessively objectionable or crude content will be rejected along with apps that are designed to upset or disgust users			2
apps containing pornographic material , defined by @entity64 as ' explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings ' , will be rejected			2
in summary , @entity1 said : ' we will reject apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line			1
what line , you ask ? well , as a @entity81 once said , “ i ’ll know it when i see it ”			0
and we think that you will also know it when you cross it			0
' some apps have been rejected because they blatantly breach @entity1 's guidelines			1
for example , apps that were considered ' offensive ' or to contain adult or mature content , and were subsequently rejected , include @entity90 , an app that involved shaking the phone to make a pair of virtual breasts move , and @entity95 that used @entity96 to plot the location of sex adverts around cities			1
there was also the @entity102 app that involved causing a gust of air to lift up girls ' skirts on the screen and @entity109 app that would remove clothing from a virtual model each time a user won a card hand			0
other apps that contained less obvious adult content but were still rejected included @entity118 's @entity117 game			1
it involves riding a horse through clouds and sending ponies to their death by jumping on them			0
although it was initially rejected for containing ' mature content ' , this decision was appealed and the app was later accepted			0
the @entity129 app , which asked people questions about their view on same - sex marriage and abortion , was originally accepted			0
following a petition on @entity137 , though , the app was removed			0
a revised version was submitted and a counter-petition was filed with 48,000 signatures in support of keeping the app on the @entity5 but the @entity129 app was rejected on the basis it was offensive to ' large groups of people			1
' an app that was rejected for having ' objectionable content ' was called @entity149 and involved superimposing people 's faces on to religious images including pictures of @entity154			0
the @entity156 app , left , let users choose one of 18 high - profile @entity159 politicians and make them bounce on a virtual trampoline			0
it was rejected because ' @entity1 does not approve of ridiculing public figures			1
' @entity164 app , right , was rejected because it contained ' questionable content ' ghetto tweets , pictured , was designed as a language converter that would turn regular tweets into street slang , for example , the word @entity166 became @entity172			0
this app was originally accepted but following complaints , it was deemed offensive and removed from the store another was called the @entity177 that could be used to convert amounts of marijuana			1
the ' mobile sports game ' send me to @entity31 was rejected because it challenged users to throw their iphones as high into the air as possible			2
it used the device 's built - in accelerometer to determine how high into the air the phone was thrown , but @entity1 rejected it because it could cause damage to the devices or to the users			1
the @entity22 was rejected because it could be used to calculate how much radiation was being emitted by mobiles and mobile phone masts			2
@entity1 said that that app could confuse users and potentially frighten them and this was irresponsible			2
an app that was rejected because it had ' no user functionality ' was the i am @entity201 app , pictured			0
it did n't have any gameplay or function built - in yet cost $ 1,000 ( £ 650 )			0
it was designed purely for people to show off how much money they had the @entity129 app that asked people questions about their view on same - sex marriage and abortion was removed for being offensive to ' large groups of people ' ghetto tweets was designed as a language converter that would turn regular tweets into street slang , for example , the word @entity166 became @entity172			0
this app was originally accepted but following complaints it was deemed offensive and removed from the @entity175			1
one of the guidelines in @entity1 's @entity5 states that apps must work as expected			1
two apps that were rejected because they had ' no user functionality ' at all were the i am @entity201 apps and the subsequent i am poor apps			2
the i am @entity201 app had no functions and cost $ 1,000 ( £ 650 )			0
it was designed purely for people to show off how much money they had			0
the i am poor app was rejected on the same basis that it was simply designed for people to show how cheap they were for buying a 99 cent app. the @entity156 app , which let users choose one of 18 high - profile @entity159 politicians and make them bounce on a virtual trampoline in the @entity246 was rejected because ' @entity1 does not approve of ridiculing public figures			1
