the idea of capturing an asteroid may seem unbelievable to most			0
yet following @entity5 president @entity4 's instructions to @entity6 that he wants to snare an asteroid and then launch it into the moon / earth orbit , the space agency has released a video of how it could be done			1
this is all part of the development of a potential manned mission to @entity13			0
the project , which envisions that astronauts could visit such an asteroid as early as 2021 , is included in president @entity4 's £ 11.5 billion spending plan for the @entity5 space agency for the 2014 tax year			1
@entity6 would find an asteroid which is between 23 and 33 feet wide			1
they would then tow or push it towards @entity42 so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon			0
in 2021 astronauts would then use an @entity47 - a manned spacecraft - to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for analysis			2
this asteroid would also , probably in the 2030s , be used as a stop - off point for astronauts on their way to @entity13			2
it is intended as an expansion of existing initiatives to find asteroids that may be on a collision course with @entity42 , and as part of preparations for a human expedition to @entity13 in the 2030s			0
‘ this mission allows us to better develop our technology and systems to explore farther than we 've ever been before - to an asteroid and to mars - places that humanity has dreamed about … but has had no hope of ever attaining , ’ @entity6 administrator @entity67 said			1
‘ we 're on the threshold of being able to tell my kids and my grandkids that we 're almost there			0
’ in 2010 , mr @entity4 proposed that @entity6 follow the @entity83 programme with a human mission to an asteroid by 2025			1
the agency has been developing a heavy - lift rocket and deep - space capsule capable of carrying astronauts beyond the station 's 250 mile high orbit			1
the system would be capable of traveling to the moon , asteroids and eventually to @entity13 , the long - term goal of the @entity5 human space programme			2
the president wants scientists to finding a small asteroid that could be shifted into an orbit near the moon and used by astronauts as a stepping stone for an eventual mission to @entity13 ‘ i think the asteroid - retrieval mission lays out a place for us to go , ’ @entity106 director @entity105 said			2
‘ it does everything that needs to be done as far as developing the technologies and the skills that we need for exploration beyond planet earth			0
’ mr @entity4 's 2014 spending plan proposes £ 68 million to start work on the new mission , which entails finding a 23 to 33 foot wide asteroid and robotically towing or pushing it toward @entity42 so it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon			1
astronauts aboard an @entity47 capsule would then blast off , land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for analysis			2
‘ the plan combines the science of mining an asteroid , along with developing ways to deflect one , along with providing a place to develop ways we can go to @entity13 , ’ said @entity5 senator @entity133 , a @entity135 @entity134			0
@entity4 wants @entity6 to start work on a potential mission to @entity13 ( image shows a concept for the mission ) the project , which envisions that astronauts could visit such an asteroid as early as 2021 , is included in president @entity4 's £ 11.5 billion spending plan for the @entity5 space agency for the 2014 tax year @entity6 has not yet estimated the total cost of the mission , but expects it to be less than the £ 1.7 billion estimated last year by the @entity159 's @entity158			1
‘ we do not think at this point that it will be that expensive , ’ @entity6 chief financial officer @entity160 said			2
the @entity168 - led ‘ @entity167 ’ proposed relocating a 500 - ton asteroid closer to @entity42 to give astronauts a ‘ unique , meaningful and affordable ’ destination in the next decade , meeting mr @entity4 's deadline			1
ms @entity160 said @entity168 's cost estimate did not take into account projects already under way at @entity6 and proposed retrieving a type of asteroid that orbits farther away which would require a longer and more expensive mission			1
@entity6 also would look to partner with fledging space mining companies , such as start - ups @entity179 and @entity180 , as well as agencies interested in planetary defence			1
it is intended as an expansion of existing initiatives to find asteroids that may be on a collision course with @entity42 , and as part of preparations for a human expedition to @entity13 in the 2030s ‘ obviously we 're looking all sorts of interests in this asteroid mission in terms of the kinds of scientific and industrial uses that could be spawned from it , ’ ms @entity160 added			2
interest in potentially threatening asteroids sky - rocketed after a small asteroid exploded over @entity202 , @entity203 on february 15 , shattering windows and damaging buildings			0
about 1,500 people were injured by flying glass and debris			0
the same day another larger asteroid passed about 17,200 miles from @entity42 - closer than the television and communication satellites that ring the planet			0
the incidents had created an imperative ‘ to develop techniques and technology that will help deter or to keep an asteroid or other type of body from impacting @entity42 , ’ mr @entity67 said			0
‘ one of the serendipitous results from this [ asteroid - retrieval ] flight we hope will be the demonstration of a capability to move an asteroid , to deflect it ever so slightly			0
’ mr @entity4 is also requesting £ 535 million to support efforts to develop commercial space taxis in hopes of breaking @entity203 's monopoly on crew transportation to the space station by 2017			1
the @entity5 has been unable to fly astronauts since it retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011 .			0

@entity4 wants @entity6 to begin search for a *suitable* asteroid
*animation* looks *simple* enough - capture it like a fish in a net
@entity6 working on heavy - lift rocket and deep - space capsule for the mission
the programme is expected to cost less than the estimated £ 1.7 million
