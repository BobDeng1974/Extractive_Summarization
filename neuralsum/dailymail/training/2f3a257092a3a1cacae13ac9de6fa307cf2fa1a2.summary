like the rest of us , @entity0 has watched aghast at all the @entity4 antics since they lost in the @entity6 at @entity7			1
how many own goals is it possible for one team to score ? the 65 - year - old @entity11 , so steeped in @entity6 lore — eight times a player and thrice a captain — believes the @entity4 agony will be prolonged with ill - advised moves such as the appointment of a task force			1
‘ it will swing back @entity4 ’s way if they do n’t panic but that ’s exactly what they seem to be doing , ’ he said			1
‘ the task force just looks a publicity stunt to me			1
they lost the @entity6 because they lost the foursomes matches 7 - 1			1
how ’s a task force going to help on that ? ’ @entity28 believes @entity4 agony will be prolonged with moves such as the appointment of a task force @entity4 team captain @entity32 and @entity33 stand together during a practice round at @entity7 maybe the task force will be disbanded now the maverick behind it , @entity36 president @entity35 , has been unceremoniously fired after hurling social media insults at @entity40 that would have been unbecoming in a playground			1
‘ during my time they had presidents who kept in the background , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ now they want to get involved and help but it has the opposite effect			2
‘ the @entity40 spat was an undignified thing for a man in his position to get involved in , and his appointment of @entity32 did n’t work either			2
there was clearly a generation gap between @entity32 and his players and it made for a marked contrast with @entity58			2
he was one of the boys and they wanted to play for him			2
’ @entity33 , of course , could hardly have made it clearer in the losing team ’s press conference he did not want to play for @entity32			2
@entity0 believes this was another spectacular own goal			2
he said : ‘ @entity33 is a lovely guy , but it surely needed someone to tap him on the shoulder and say , “ we all appreciate your passion and you ’re trying to help , but your timing is completely wrong ”			0
i would have been very disappointed if one of my players had done that			0
@entity33 must surely regret his actions in the cold light of day			0
’ mickelson of the @entity4 talks during a press conference after his team were defeated by @entity83 what would @entity0 do if he was in charge ? ‘ i ’d certainly get rid of the wildcards , ’ he said			1
‘ i do n’t know why they copied the @entity83 on that one			0
we had to do it because a lot of our players were competing in @entity4 , but the @entity4 should just take the top 12 off their order of merit after the @entity93			1
that way you ’re letting every player know exactly what he needs to do to make the team			0
‘ they also need to stop over-reacting			0
the @entity4 college system is too strong not to turn out more great golfers			1
they were without key players in @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			0
what a difference they would have made			0
‘ and look at @entity107 , where they lost by a whisker , or @entity110 in 2010 , where they won three of the four series of matches			0
they ’re acting like they ’re a million miles away			0
’ as for the @entity83 , the only big decision looming is who should be captain in 2016			0
@entity0 is another who would plump for @entity121 over @entity122			0
‘ i look at @entity121 ’s @entity6 record over @entity122 ’s , and his general standing in the game , ’ he argued			1
and @entity0 himself ? it is now 15 months since that fateful day when he suffered a cardiac arrest and was pronounced clinically dead , but thankfully he has made a full recovery			0
@entity121 of @entity130 shares a joke on the 10th tee during the pro-am day at the @entity134 he was back working for @entity135 at @entity136 and the @entity6 and yesterday opened a comprehensive performance centre at the well - named @entity138 driving range at @entity140 , @entity141			1
i ’m back playing golf , going to the gym and driving again , ’ he said			0
he and wife @entity144 are also thinking over a @entity6 reunion of their own this winter			1
‘ @entity147 and his wife @entity148 have invited us to @entity150 to stay for a few days , ’ he said			0
a @entity6 task force , then , that does make sense			1
quote of the week ‘ @entity156 ’s record stands by itself			0
six majors and all - time @entity6 points			1
yours v his ? @entity160			0
’ @entity36 president @entity35 takes @entity40 to task for having the temerity to stick up for a team - mate savaged by sir @entity156 — and only succeeds in tweeting his own death warrant			1
@entity165 of @entity130 catching the lid of the @entity167 as it is presented to him by @entity36 president @entity35 ( right ) hats off to @entity171 and @entity172 with 111th place in the race to @entity175 the cut - off mark for keeping your @entity178 privileges for next season , imagine what it must have been like being on and around that mark and turning up for the last event of the regular campaign in @entity186 last week ? a tip of the hat , therefore , to @entity11 @entity189 , who moved from 116th place to 103rd on the back of finishing tied fourth , and @entity192 @entity172 , who held on to that all - important 111th spot by finishing tied 23rd			1
@entity189 of @entity194 watches his third shot on the third hole during day three of the @entity197			2

@entity4 have scored a number of own goals since their @entity6 loss
@entity28 believes @entity4 agony will be prolonged with ill - advised moves such as the appointment of a task force
maybe the task force will be disbanded following the sacking of @entity36 president @entity35
a tip of the hat to @entity11 @entity189 , who moved from 116th place to 103rd in the race to @entity175
