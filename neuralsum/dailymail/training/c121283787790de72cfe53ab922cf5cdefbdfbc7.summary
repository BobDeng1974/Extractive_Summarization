by @entity0 published : 09:04 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 11:29 est , 15 october 2013 a ten year - old boy with one of the rarest disorders in the @entity4 is surviving - thanks to a diet of @entity6			1
@entity7 is one of just three people in the country with @entity10 which means his body converts protein into lethal toxins which damage his vital organs			1
he is limited to just 25g of protein a day - equivalent to a pint of milk - and any more than that could kill him			1

the condition means his body converts protein into lethal toxins which poison his vital organs			1
he is limited to just 25g of protein a day - equivalent to a pint of milk - and any more than that could kill him the genetic disorder is incurable but brave @entity7 is beating it by drinking up to four bottles of @entity6 a day , which gives him the energy he can not get from food			1
his daily intake of the drink contains a whopping 33 teaspoons of sugar - and costs his parents £ 120 every month			1
his father @entity38 , 45 , an auctioneer , said : ' it just keeps him going - we wish we could get it on prescription			2
' if he is starting to feel a bit tired , maybe after he has been running around , it will just pick him up again straight away			0
the genetic disorder is incurable but @entity7 is beating it by drinking up to four bottles of @entity6 a day , which gives him the energy he can not get from food			1
his daily intake of the drink contains a 33 teaspoons of sugar - and costs his parents £ 120 every month ' without a doubt , without that drink , we would be in serious trouble			1
we ’ve tried all sorts of different foods but this is the one for @entity7			2
' when @entity7 , from @entity60 , @entity59 was born , he did not respond to the world around him and doctors initially misdiagnosed him as being on the autistic spectrum			2
it was not until his second birthday that a routine blood and urine test revealed he had @entity10			2
@entity10 ( @entity69 ) is a rare disorder that is inherited from both parents			2
neither parent shows symptoms , but both carry a defective gene responsible for this disorder			0
people with @entity69 can not break down parts of protein and some types of fat due to either a missing or a non-functioning enzyme called @entity83			2
this inability causes a build - up of harmful substances which can cause damage to the person ’s heart , liver , brain , and bones			2
the result can be seizures , delays to normal development like walking and talking , and other health problems			0
during times of illness , a patient with @entity69 may need to be hospitalised to prevent breakdown of proteins within the body			0
every day a @entity69 patient must try and get enough protein for normal growth - but not so much that they become ill. although some @entity69 children learn to eat , most require tube feeding since they have little to no appetite and food aversions			1
source : @entity113 unchecked , the condition would create toxic amino acids which would attack vital organs and eventually his entire body would shut down			1
mr @entity7 and his wife @entity119 , 42 , immediately swapped his normal milk and baby food for non-protein food and saw an overnight change			2
@entity7 , who weighs barely five stone , now eats tiny portions alongside his parents and older brother @entity127 , 16 , but carefully avoids high protein foods like fish			1
he now drinks up to four 380ml bottles of @entity6 a day , each containing 33g of sugar			1
mr @entity7 added : he eats a lot of carbs too , like crisps and noodles , with the @entity6 too of course and anything high sugar			1
' when he is well you would n’t know there was anything different about him , but he is about the height of an eight - year - old simply because he is eating so much less			0
' his mother 42 , an administrator , said : ' we are very lucky he is still alive - it is a silent killer			0
you just do n’t know what can happen			0
' when he gets very lethargic , we have to be careful			0
when he vomits , we have to get him to hospital immediately			0
' he ca n’t have too much protein			0
when we go to @entity151 ’s for a treat , he has to have the chips , and only half the burger , with no bun			0
' for him , an egg is a treat			0
he ca n’t have any more			0
it ’s heart - wrenching			0
' we do n’t know what the future holds but we are just happy that he is a happy little boy and loving life			0

@entity7 is one of just three people in the @entity4 with @entity10
condition means his body converts protein into lethal toxins which poison his vital organs - and even an egg could kill him
drinking four bottles of @entity6 a day gives him the energy he needs
this equates to 33 teaspoons of sugar a day and £ 120 a month
