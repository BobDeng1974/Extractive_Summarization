@entity0 drove themselves one step closer to the @entity3 title with another defensive masterclass at the @entity5 , shutting out @entity6 just a week after doing the same to @entity7			1
led magnificently by @entity10 , @entity9 ’s side have proved once again that a solid back four is the bedrock of any title challenge			1
from the meanest to the most successful , @entity14 takes a look at the best defences in @entity3 history			2
@entity10 ( centre ) , @entity19 ( left ) and @entity20 celebrate @entity0 's goalless draw at @entity6 @entity6 1997 - 98 ... @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 / @entity25 , @entity26 these rear @entity27 might have been getting a little long in the tooth , but it did n’t stop them delivering the @entity30 for @entity31 in his first full season in @entity34 football			1
they conceded 33 @entity3 goals along the way as they pipped @entity7 to the title			1
@entity23 was the main man in a fiercely solid unit that had been forged under @entity40			0
they knew each other ’s game inside out and few defences down the years could match this one for experience and knowhow			0
( from left ) @entity24 , @entity23 , @entity26 and @entity22 celebrate the title @entity6 2003 - 04 ... @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 six years on and it was an entirely new @entity6 backline that will forever be lauded for their contribution to the @entity57 , @entity31 ’s team that amazingly went unbeaten on their way to the title in 2004			2
the @entity27 conceded only 26 goals in the process as they finished 11 points clear of @entity0			1
@entity52 had succeeded @entity23 as the kingpin and they had more attack - minded full backs in @entity53 and @entity50 , but the old defensive steel was as strong as ever			0
@entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 ( not pictured ) formed one of the league 's best defences @entity52 played alongside @entity51 in the season @entity6 went unbeaten as @entity53 and @entity50 ( right ) confront @entity72 after their side 's infamous 0 - 0 draw with @entity7 at @entity75 in 2003 @entity0 2004 - 05 ... @entity76 , @entity10 , @entity77 , @entity78 no team in @entity3 history has conceded fewer goals than @entity9 ’s side in his first season in @entity34 after the @entity85 coach moved to @entity86 fresh from his @entity88 triumph with @entity89			1
@entity0 ’s defence was breached just 15 times as they won the title with 95 points , another @entity3 record			1
@entity9 brought @entity76 and @entity78 with him from @entity89 and the effect was instant			0
@entity77 and @entity10 celebrate after the latter scored for @entity0 in a 4 - 1 win against @entity98 @entity7 1998 - 99 ... @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 @entity7 ’s treble winners were not the meanest by any stretch , letting in 37 goals in 1999 compared with the 17 conceded by nearest challengers @entity6			1
but the attacking instincts of sir @entity109 ’s side always meant it was going to be a case of ‘ we ’ll score more goals than you ’ , as was evident in the two 3 - 3 draws with @entity116 that season			2
@entity109 has since said that @entity102 would be the only certain inclusion in a best xi picked from his time at @entity75 , while selling @entity100 was arguably his biggest regret			0
either way , this back four deserves their place in the hall of fame on the basis of the club ’s @entity127 achievement			0
@entity129 ( centre ) and @entity99 ( right ) , pictured with @entity131 and @entity132 ( top ) , formed half of @entity7 's treble - winning defence			2
@entity102 played at left back with @entity101 partnering @entity136 @entity137 united 2006 - 07 , 2007 - 08 , 2008 - 09 : @entity99 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 this was an altogether more compact @entity7 , conceding an average of 24 goals on their way to winning the title three years in a row			2
has there ever been a better bit of january transfer business than the two deals united completed in 2006 to sign @entity139 and @entity140 from @entity151 and @entity152 respectively ? @entity139 teamed up with the majestic @entity138 to forge one of the great central defensive partnerships , playing together in three @entity88 finals , while @entity72 was still going strong at right back			0
@entity157 's celebration is overlooked by @entity140 , @entity139 and @entity138 in the summer of 2007 @entity138 's partnership with @entity139 helped @entity7 to successive titles in 2007 , 2008 and 2009 @entity160 20011 - 12 : @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 @entity160 ’s success in conceding only 29 goals was ultimately crucial in snatching the title away from @entity7 on goal difference after an unforgettable final day of the season in 2012			1
@entity162 , who lifted the trophy , was well on his way to establishing himself as a @entity160 legend , as was @entity161			0
both players had been signed by @entity174 , along with @entity163 , but the defensive nous of @entity177 @entity176 helped turn @entity160 into a more solid unit before he brought in the combative @entity164 from @entity179			0
@entity162 is mobbed by his defensive partner @entity164 after scoring against @entity181			0

@entity20 , @entity10 , @entity19 and @entity183 all *starred* in @entity0 's 0 - 0 draw against @entity6 at the @entity5
@entity0 have conceded only 26 goals this season
they are closing in on another @entity3 title under @entity9
@entity0 's defence have proved that a solid back four is key to a charge
@entity195 : @entity10 is the @entity3 's greatest ever defender
@entity10 on course to take part in all @entity3 games for first time in his *career*
