he is a striker and when you come to a new club you want to make an impression as quickly as possible and that means scoring goals			1
' we could see he was going to give us something we did n't have last year , which was pace and power on the break			2
' it was an outstanding goal and i had n't realised until i saw it again how deep he picked the ball up			2
' he kept on going and you always sensed he was going to go all the way and get a shot off			2
thankfully there was enough power on it to beat @entity9			2
it was fantastic goal to win any game			2
' progress : @entity2 manager @entity1 saw his side win after six successive league defeats at @entity7 @entity4 might also have had a penalty in the first half when he appeared to be tripped by @entity61 and he went close to a second when he almost connected with a @entity63 cross			1
@entity64 went closest for @entity7 when he hit the bar and the @entity66 also appealed for a penalty late on after a challenge by @entity69 , but he was instead booked for diving			1
@entity1 said : ' apparently people were saying it was a good call for a penalty			1
' but i saw the one we should have had in the first half , which i felt was a good call			2

we scored a goal so we would have won anyway			0

the @entity120 said : ' i think we were a very patient team , we tried to create space but @entity2 defended very well , and we could n't create space			1

' it was too easy ( for them ) the way they scored the goal in a counter-attack , from a corner in their own box and he ran 70 metres to score			0
' in these games it is very important to be patient but it is more important not to concede			0
they defended always with 10 strong players behind the ball			0
