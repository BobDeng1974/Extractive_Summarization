a woman has been left paralysed from the waist down after contracting tonsillitis so severe that she was hospitalised on her 21st birthday			1
@entity4 , 22 , has spent months learning to walk again after she was diagnosed with a condition called transverse myelitis , thought to have been triggered by a virus			1
the rare reaction caused a severe inflammation of her spinal chord , and her nervous system was attacked - leaving her complete paralysed below the waist			1
her condition was so severe that she collapsed and was hospitalised on her 21st birthday			1
she said : ' i know a lot of people end up in hospital on their 21st birthday , but usually it involves alcohol - i was stone cold sober , and terrified			1
@entity4 has been left paralysed from the waist down after contracting tonsillitis so severe that she was hospitalised on her 21st birthday ' two days later i was completely paralysed from the waist down - and it was all thanks to tonsillitis			1
i never would have thought something as routine as tonsillitis would have stopped me walking			1
' ' i had never had tonsillitis before in my life , ' she said			1
' i had been suffering with it for a few weeks , but when i collapsed i knew this was not an average case			2
' miss @entity4 , of @entity33 , was treated and discharged , but a week after leaving hospital , miss @entity4 started complaining of strange sensations in her hand			1
she said : ' it started in my hands - i could n’t bend my fingers			2
' it was a really hot summer and whenever i picked up a cold can in a shop i found it painful			2
it felt like electric currant shooting through my hand			2
' i went to my doctor and they told me it was probably a trapped nerve and referred me to physiotherapist			2
the rare reaction caused a catastrophic inflammation of her spinal chord , and her nervous system was attacked ' by the time i saw the physio the sensation had spread to my legs			1
the physio was shocked and said it was more serious than a trapped nerve			2
' the condition baffled experts - who at first diagnosed her with either kidney or liver failure , until tests for both came back negative			1
she was then referred to a neurologist as doctors thought the strange sensations could have been brought on by depression			2
she said : ' the neurologist saw a large inflammation on my spinal chord but nobody could tell me what it was			1
' then on her 21st birthday , while she was enjoying a celebratory meal , her symptoms took a turn for the worse and she collapsed again			1
by the next day , she could n’t feel anything below her waist			0
she said : ' at least when you have the weird sensations you can feel something			0
i could n’t feel anything and it was unbelievably scary			0
' it 's like being on a plane and then suddenly you hear all the loud noises stop - the absence of noise is more terrifying			0
' it was only when she became paralysed that she was diagnosed with transverse myelitis - a rare neurological condition which consists of inflammation of the spinal cord			1
she has spent months learning to walk again after contracting a condition called transverse myelitis the condition myelitis causes sensory loss in the upper or lower parts of the body and in rare cases can cause complete paralysis			1
it is caused when a patient ’s immune system reacts abnormally and attacks tissues and organs in the body			1
doctors said that in miss @entity4 ’s case , the shock of her severe tonsillitis effectively reprogrammed her immune system to attack the tissue in her spine			1
miss @entity4 said : ' this mystery illness of mine which had been through every diagnosis under the sun had turned out to be this really unusual condition			1
' miss @entity4 was hospitalised for the next six months			1
ever since then she has been confined to a wheelchair			0
she said : ' one in three people with my disease will get completely better and have no lasting symptoms			0
transverse myelitis is a neurological condition that triggers inflammation of the spinal cord			1
it is thought to be caused by a virus experts remain unsure of the exact cause			2
it is very rare and affects just 300 @entity142 each year			2
symptoms include weakness , ' heaviness ' and numbness of the limbs			0
in severe cases this can lead to total paralysis			2
it may also cause someone to be more sensitive to touch , cold , and heat			0
there may also be tight and painful muscle contractions ( known as tonic muscle spasms )			0
the symptoms and signs depend upon the extent of the spinal cord affected			2
around 70 per cent of sufferers will never recover but intensive physiotherapy can help reduce symptoms			0
' another one in three will have partial recovery and have partial mobility - but still suffer with symptoms			0
' the final third do n’t make any recovery at all			0
' now approaching the two - year anniversary of her 21st birthday , mrs @entity4 has started to learn to walk again			1
she said : ' i can walk very small distances now - i ’m trying to slowly build back up			0
' at one point i was told i would never get back out of bed again			0
' i went to a specialist rehabilitation place			0
first i worked on being able to sit up , because i could n’t support myself at all			0
i was like a ragdoll i kept falling to the side all the time			0
' then i progressed to using a standing hoist			0
they put a belt round my waist and it takes my weight through my arms			0
' then i started walking while being supported by people			0
' i can walk short distances by myself now , but it is very tiring for me to walk around so i have to use the chair out of the house nearly all the time			0
' walking for the first time in nearly two years felt unbelievable - i had been on my back for so long and i never thought i would know what it feels like to stand on two feet again			0
' mrs @entity4 wo n’t know for sure if she ’ll be able to lose her wheelchair until three years after her initial paralysis			1
she said : ' it is a possibility that i might completely get rid of the chair			0
' but doctors said they have to wait another year to determine what the long - term effects of my condition are			2
