it is such a ridiculous thing to ask , nobody would do that			2
it ’s the @entity6 for goodness sake			0

you ca n’t mess with something like the @entity6 - its simply not done			0
' he branded the allegation ' insane ' and said he would never have groped anyone while the cameras were rolling and with the audience in full view			1
@entity2 said : ' that is a completely insane claim , and it ’s especially insane as i ’ve seen the video			1
' he rubbished claims he had groped a girl , adding : ' we are surrounded by the audience and cameras and people			1
that ’s not good for my career			2
' if i had been caught doing that in the @entity9 studio i should have thought that the book would have been thrown at me and i would have been out of the @entity6			1

' a sketch of @entity2 giving evidence in his own defence at the court yesterday @entity2 asked jurors to ' think logically about it '			1
he went on : ' if these women supposedly are chasing after me because i was the pop star of the day , the question would have to be , why would i go and assault somebody ? ' i do n’t like the idea of assaulting women in any way , shape or form			2
' asked about claims that he put his hand up a woman ’s skirt in front of the organiser of a @entity166 event he was working at , @entity2 said he ' should be committed somewhere ' if that had happened because it would have been bad for business			1

' i hate this idea that there is no smoke without fire			0
' i can only say what i know and the way i feel about things			0
' if i had been caught doing that in the @entity9 studio i should have thought that the book would have been thrown at me and i would have been out of the @entity6 ' - @entity2 ' if i had sexually assaulted this girl in my dressing room , i would fully expect her to go and tell her boss and the boss would tell the person running the panto and that would immediately get me in big trouble			1
' he dismissed the idea that she would have decided not to complain because he was a celebrity			0
