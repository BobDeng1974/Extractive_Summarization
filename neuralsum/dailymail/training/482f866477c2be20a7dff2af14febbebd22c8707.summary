on trial : @entity10 , 25 , from @entity11 in @entity12 , pictured left , and @entity27 , 41 , right , appeared at @entity9 to answer child cruelty charges the court was told that ms @entity10 had been attempting to move the tv to plug in a scart lead so she could watch a dvd when it fell			1
@entity17 's father , @entity27 , 41 , was also under the influence of drugs at the time and had passed out on the kitchen floor earlier , the court was told			1
@entity40 , prosecuting , said : ' the prosecution case is that @entity10 was not in any fit state to look after a child			1
she had taken heroin and valium and an amount of alcohol			1
' she chose to become intoxicated to the extent that she was not capable of caring for her child in a safe and appropriate manner			1
' miss @entity51 said the defendant was ' careless and drug - fuelled ' , and that no sober person would have failed to notice the dangerousness of a child 's head lying so close to a heavy television			1
' her needs were more important than her child , ' she said			1
' the simple step of moving @entity17 would have saved his life			2
' she showed careless indifference to the life of her child that night			1
' this was not a tragic accident , every parent 's nightmare			2
this was an entirely preventable death			2
an accident that should never have happened			0
' the prosecution also said that @entity27 had a responsibility to @entity17 and that he too was in no fit state to look after him and should have ensured someone else did			0
@entity76 , from @entity77 , denies manslaughter by gross negligence and child cruelty			1
@entity27 , from @entity81 , denies child cruelty			1
when the police inquiry started , it became clear that the defendants had had dealings with drug agencies and social services , the court heard			0
a history of drug abuse and relationship difficulties also soon emerged , said ms @entity51			0
the pair had lived in @entity94 until 2009 but @entity76 ended the relationship and moved to @entity11 to be closer to her family because she said @entity27 was violent and controlling			0
but their relationship was rekindled despite the disapproval of @entity76 's family and he effectively moved in with her			0
the court was told that ms @entity10 , pictured , had been attempting to plug in a scart lead when the television fell @entity27 had previously had two children removed from his care with a different partner because of his drug problems			1
as a consequence @entity76 knew social services would be concerned and she attempted to hide the fact that he was living with her , the jury was told			2
she initially lied to social workers that he played a ' very little part ' in her life and she was no longer abusing drugs			0
@entity76 also concealed the relationship from health visitors			0
ms @entity51 added : ' the prosecution say that @entity10 was clearly not being honest with healthcare and other professionals who were trying to assist her and @entity17			0
' she was hiding the full extent of her illicit drug use and her relationship with @entity27			0
' the court heard that the numerous professionals who visited the household were satisfied that @entity17 was healthy and being well cared for			0
when @entity76 was interviewed by police , she told them it was an accident but she had not been using drugs at the time			2
miss @entity51 said the defendant was ' abusive and rude ' at the custody desk when she was bailed on the night of december 6			0
' her priority seemed to be getting her cigarettes , having a shower and a change , ' she said , ' rather than getting to her seriously - ill son as soon as possible			2
' she maintained in a second interview that she was the one who knocked the television over but in a defence statement served to the court she said it was @entity27 who dropped it and she was upstairs at the time			0
it was her position , said ms @entity51 , that she lied about the whole incident from the 999 call onwards at @entity27 's request			0
the prosecutor said that her defence ' does not hold close scrutiny ' and that she was trying to shift the blame on to her co-defendant			0
' what mother would be prepared to accept responsibility for the obviously serious injuries that would lead to her child 's death , ' she said			1
' we say she told the truth about one thing - that she was responsible for moving and then dropping the television on @entity170			1
' @entity27 told detectives he had taken two valium tablets and drunk three cans of strong lager on the night in question			2
he fell asleep on the kitchen floor and was woken up to be told by @entity76 that she had dropped the television			2
