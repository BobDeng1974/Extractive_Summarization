control : sir @entity1 said foreign nations should decide the fate of their own children judges and social workers were yesterday warned that they must not seize control of the lives of foreign children			1
no court can order a child from @entity12 to be taken from their parents or given up for adoption , said @entity16 ’s most senior family law judge , sir @entity1			1
overseas authorities should always have a say in cases involving their nationals , and the future of foreign children must be decided by courts in their own country , he said			0
judges and social workers must no longer keep their decisions secret or try to gag foreign media either , he added			1
sir @entity1 , the president of the @entity29 of the @entity29 , laid down rules for judges dealing with such issues as he handled the case of a 12 - year - old boy from @entity35			1
the judge said the @entity35 boy - whose case has been heavily reported by newspapers in @entity40 - should live with an aunt			1
@entity35 authorities were closely involved in the case			2
it comes six weeks after the scandal over @entity46 , an @entity47 mother who was forced by a @entity16 judge in the secretive @entity49 to undergo a compulsory caesarean			1
miss @entity46 , 35 , who suffers from bipolar disorder , was sectioned under the @entity52 after suffering a breakdown at @entity54 during a short visit to @entity16			0
in secret court hearings , a @entity49 judge ordered that she undergo a compulsory caesarean , and a family court judge in @entity60 overruled her pleas and ordered that her baby daughter should be adopted in this country			2
last month sir @entity1 rejected an application by @entity66 social workers forbidding @entity16 and @entity47 newspapers from naming miss @entity46			1
he said that the attempt to deny her a right to speak out in public was ‘ an affront to humanity ’			0
miss @entity46 may now be named in public , while the name of her baby being brought up in @entity66 , and her adoptive parents , remain secret			2
the case of @entity79 and the future of her baby have yet to be finalised by the courts			2
but yesterday in the similar case of the @entity35 boy sir @entity1 laid down a series of rules for judges ‘ in a wider context ’ which he said courts must follow in future			1
sir @entity1 said : ‘ to seek to shelter in this context behind our normal practice of sitting in private and limiting the permissible flow of information to outsiders is not merely unprincipled ; it is likely to be counter-productive and , potentially , extremely damaging			1
controversial : several decisions have been made by the @entity49 , which sits mostly in secret and presides over cases involving mental health issues or people deemed unable to decide for themselves ‘ if anyone thinks this an unduly radical approach , they might pause to think how we would react if roles were reversed and the boot was on the other foot			0
’ he added : ‘ it is one of frequently voiced complaints that the courts of @entity114 and @entity115 are exorbitant in their exercise of their care jurisdiction over children from other @entity12 countries			0
‘ the number of care cases involving children from other @entity12 countries has risen sharply in recent years and significant numbers of care cases now involve such children			0
abuse : there has been a sharp rise in care cases coming to @entity16 courts ( photo posed by model ) ‘ it would be idle to ignore the fact that these concerns are only exacerbated by the fact that the @entity16 is unusual in @entity12 in permitting the total severance of family ties without parental consent			0
' the outcome of care proceedings in @entity114 and @entity115 may be that a child who is a national of another @entity12 country is adopted by an @entity114 family notwithstanding the vigorous protests of the child ’s @entity147 parents			0
' it is one of the frequently voiced complaints that the courts of @entity114 and @entity115 are exorbitant in their exercise of their care jurisdiction over children from other @entity12 countries			0
’ the judge said children must live in @entity16 for @entity16 courts to hold sway			0
for a family judge to act , foreign authorities must be permitted in court and kept fully informed , he added			2
he said @entity114 courts should allow @entity12 judges to decide on the lives of children who live mainly in their countries , and @entity114 judges should make declarations that they have no jurisdiction in such cases			0
sir @entity1 also condemned efforts by social workers and courts in @entity114 to silence foreign newspapers			1
‘ as a general principle , any attempt by the @entity114 court to control foreign media , whether directly or indirectly , is simply impermissible , ' he said			2
' for the courts of another state to assume such a role involves an exercise of jurisdiction which is plainly exorbitant , not least as involving interference in the internal affairs of another state			0
' what would we think , what would the @entity114 media think , if a family judge in @entity193 were to order the @entity194 to desist from complaining about the way in which the judicial and other state authorities in @entity193 were handling a case involving an @entity114 mother ? '			1

@entity29 family judge sir @entity1 spoke out in case of @entity35 boy
he said attempts by social workers to gag media were ' impermissible '
it comes after @entity47 mother was given forced caesarean in secret case
