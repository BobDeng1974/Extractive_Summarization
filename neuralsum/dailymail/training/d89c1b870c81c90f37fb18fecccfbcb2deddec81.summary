@entity2 's @entity1 educated half - brother is publishing his autobiography next month , painting a dramatically different picture of their few meetings from the one the president related in his best - selling ' @entity8 ' memoir			1
@entity9 includes an appendix in his book , cataloguing what he says are factual errors in ' dreams ' – including words falsely attributed to his mother , a @entity17 woman named @entity18			1
' a lot of the stuff that @entity2 wrote is wrong in that book , and i can understand that , ' he told the @entity23 last year when he planned to self - publish his book			2
' to me , ' @entity9 said then , ' for him the book was a tool for fashioning an identity and he was using composites			2
i wanted the record to be straight			0
i wanted to tell my own story , not let people tell it for me			0
@entity9 claims his father once held a knife to her throat his book , ' an @entity2 's journey : my @entity48 of @entity50 across @entity51 , ' is due in stores september 16 and published by @entity53			1
describing a two - day stretch in 1988 when the two half - brothers first met and shared a next - day lunch , @entity9 , who bears only a vague family resemblance to the president , writes that ' overall , it was a very awkward , cold meeting			1
' ' an @entity2 's journey : my @entity48 of @entity50 across three cultures , ' an autobiography of president @entity2 's @entity63 half - brother @entity9 , is due in stores on sept. 16 @entity2 , he explains , was someone he tried not to think of since he had divorced @entity18 years earlier and descended further into alcoholism and a downward career spiral			1
but with @entity67 suddenly in his living room , brought for a visit by the future president 's aunt , avoiding thoughts about their common father became uncomfortably impossible			2
it was , he writes , as ' though the skeleton that no one ever talked about had strayed into the middle of a family party			0
' @entity9 , according to a writer at @entity80 who obtained an advance copy of the book , ' described their lunch together during that second day as filled with tension , as @entity2 struggled to embrace the @entity87 heritage of a father @entity9 had rejected			1
' the author ' had refused even to use the @entity2 name , unable to forget , as a child , experiencing the alcoholism and brutality of their father			2
' the elder @entity2 was a blithely self - involved alcoholic , once killing a man in a @entity98 auto accident and dying at age 46 while driving drunk			2
his viciousness is largely absent from the president 's ' dreams ' – president @entity2 met @entity2 just once after his infancy , at age 10 – and is relegated to @entity2 quoting his half - brother criticizing @entity2 ' you think that somehow i ’m cut off from my roots , that sort of thing , ' @entity9 tells the future president in ' dreams			1
' ' well , you 're right			0
at a certain point , i made a decision not to think about who my real father was			0
he was dead to me even when he was still alive			0
i knew that he was a drunk and showed no concern for his wife or children			0
' in ' dreams , ' @entity2 casts himself as the all - seeing observer trying to connect himself back to his @entity63 roots			1
but @entity9 now recalls details that never made it into the president 's 1995 book			1
' my impression at the first meeting , ' he writes , ' was that @entity2 thought that i was too white , and i thought that he was too black			1
' ' he was an @entity134 search for his @entity87 roots			2
... i 'm an @entity134 but i was living in @entity63 , searching for my white roots			1
' @entity9 moved to @entity137 12 years ago , married a @entity137 wife , and is now fully immersed in the @entity137 language and culture accusations of violence : @entity143 says the future president thought he was ' too white ' even though they both called the same man ' father ' culture warrior : @entity9 lives in @entity149 , @entity137 with his wife and has won volunteer service awards for his campaigns against domestic violence ' i remember that when i spoke with him about the heroes of western culture , he rolled his eyes impatiently , ' he has told @entity157 , an @entity159 newspaper			1
' my feeling was that , here is an @entity134 who in many ways is trying to be a local @entity63 youth			1
this is something i tried to flee my entire life			1
' @entity9 says his effort to escape his @entity87 cultural roots was furthered in part by a desire to escape the legacy of his violent father			2
' his self - hatred and tendency toward self - sabotage was passed down and became part of my identity , ' he acknowledges in his new book			0
' my mother 's lily - white skin and my father 's ebony - black visage come to symbolize an eternal incompatibility in my mind 's eye			1
for a long time i hated to have anything to do with what my father represented , whether it was him personally , or even the positive aspects of @entity87 culture			0
' ' in violent reaction to him , ' he concludes , ' i turned passionately toward western culture and music , which brought me a measure of solace			0
' after earning degrees in physics from @entity200 and @entity201 , @entity9 honed his artistic talents in @entity137 where he lives with his wife			1
he is an accomplished pianist and recording artist who often gives lessons to orphans in the @entity137 boom town of @entity149			0
more criticisms of @entity2 surfaced in 2009 when the new president visited @entity137 during his first year in the @entity210			2
only visit : @entity2 visited the future president in @entity212 in the 1970s ( @entity213 ) for the first and only time before heading back to @entity63 , and posed ( @entity214 ) with his former wife and president @entity2 's mother @entity218 that 's when @entity9 published his first book , an autobiographical novel titled ' @entity222 to @entity149 : a @entity223			1
' it paints @entity225 as an abusive drunk who repeatedly beat him and his mother in episode after rage - filled episode			1
' there were some thumps as of someone falling , ' reads one passage that @entity9 wrote in the third - person			2
@entity236 : president @entity2 shared a laugh on wednesday with @entity239 's president @entity238 at the @entity210 's @entity134 - @entity240 in @entity241 ' his father 's angry voice raised itself			1
... he did n't remember what they were fighting about , but his stomach felt sick and empty			0
' ' his mother was being attacked and he could n't protect her			0
" you bastard ! " he remembered her screaming out			0
and that was just one night			0
' one of those nights , @entity9 writes in ' an @entity2 's @entity254 , ' resulted in his blitzed father holding a knife to his mother 's throat after she obtained a restraining order against him			1
' we @entity260 have big hands			0
they can be used to create or to debase , ' reads one portion			0
' my hands enable me to comfortably reach across twelve keys and play piano well			0
my father would use his big hands to knock my mother down when he came home from a night of drinking			0
' ' i would move protectively toward her and clutch her legs , crying , ' writes @entity9			2
' i know now why i mostly remember her legs , not her torso , or even her face			0
' his parents met when @entity225 was a graduate student at @entity280			2
they moved to @entity63 in 1964 , where he and his brother @entity282 were born			0
@entity282 later died in a motorcycle accident			0
@entity225 had earlier divorced president @entity2 's mother , @entity218 , following @entity2 's 1961 birth			1
@entity9 's mother later divorced the elder @entity2 and married another man , whose surname both mother and son also took .			1
