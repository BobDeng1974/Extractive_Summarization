@entity8 , who lived on the boat in @entity10 , @entity11 with @entity12 his pit bull , was ashore in @entity14 without her when a massive storm battered the area last thursday			1

she headed to the church because she and @entity39 sometimes had free meals there , officials believe the following day , they went to @entity95 and learned there was a man there telling people his boat sank while his dog was on board			1

@entity8 was ashore in @entity14 , @entity11 last week when a massive storm struck the area
he returned to the boat where he lived with his pit bull , @entity12 , but all he could see was the boat 's mast - and he *assumed* she had drowned
instead , she had swam to shore and made her way to a church where she often had free meals with @entity39
the church pastor found her and managed to track her owner down by going to another church handing out free meals
@entity39 , who is now homeless , sobbed when they were reunited and good *samaritans* have *donated* food and money for @entity12
