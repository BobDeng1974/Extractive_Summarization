by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 13:29 est , 4 september 2012 @entity2 's campaign released a promotional ad featuring the stars of famed stoner movie @entity6 , appealing to even the biggest slackers to watch coverage of the @entity9 online			1
in the short video , it shows the president making a serious call to someone , urging them to be ' on board ' and urging them to ' get this right ' because ' there 's a lot at stake '			0
when he hangs up , the ad pans to the other end of the phone call which shows actor @entity26 hanging up his cell while sitting on a couch watching television next to his costar @entity30			2
@entity26 is hosting the digital streaming of the @entity9 's final day , which includes the president 's acceptance speech			0
@entity30 and @entity26 are best known for their roles in the @entity6 films , which portray the hijinks of two potheads who have an affinity for @entity52 burgers and knack for getting in tricky situations			2
while that may seem like an odd choice for a political representative , @entity26 has a much longer history with the @entity2 administration			1
friendly fist - bump : @entity26 greets first lady @entity60 on the stage of the @entity9 on monday as she went through a practice of her speech that she will give tuesday night hugs : @entity26 worked for the @entity2 administration extensively since the 2008 election but took a break at one point to film the third movie in the @entity6 franchise heading south : president @entity2 left the @entity70 on tuesday for @entity71 , @entity72 for a campaign event he started doing advocacy work for the president in the 2008 campaign before the @entity78 - native took a two year break from acting in order to work as a member of @entity2 's @entity82			1
he was later promoted to associate director of the @entity84			0
because of a prior contract commitment to star in the third @entity6 movie , @entity26 left the government post for three months in 2010 so that he could film the franchise ' @entity89			0
two sides of his career : @entity26 became involved with the @entity2 administration shortly after the 2008 election ( left ) but took a break to film the third @entity6 film due to contractual obligations ( right ) according to @entity96 , he returned to a similar position in the @entity84 in november shortly after the midterm elections , though he also made several campaign appearances for different @entity100 during that hiatus			1
no word on whether or not @entity30 will also be making an appearance - or even if he is a @entity104 - but @entity26 has already been spotted at the @entity9 in @entity105 as he greeted the @entity60 on stage yesterday when she went to practice for her speech tonight .			0
