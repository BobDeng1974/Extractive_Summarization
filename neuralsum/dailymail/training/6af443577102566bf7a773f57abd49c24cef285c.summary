but do n’t be fooled – he may just be taking pity on you			0
a study has found that those who feel powerful tend not to smile back at important people , saving their smiles instead for those below them in the pecking order			1
sleazy grin : a study has found that those who feel powerful save their smiles for those below them in the pecking order researcher @entity20 said : ‘ our interpretation of this is that when you are feeling powerful and see a low - status person , you are almost throwing them a bone , thinking “ oh , i should smile at this person because i ’m better than them ”			1
’ it is well known that we tend to mimic other people ’s body language , but mr @entity20 wanted to see how we copy facial expressions and whether power and status are important			1
he asked 55 young men and women to write about a time when they felt powerful – such as leaving home to go to university – or powerless			2
they were then hooked up to equipment that measures the activity of key facial muscles , and were asked to watch short video clips of people with jobs with different levels of prestige , who were smiling or frowning at them			2
as they watched , the equipment measured the activity of the zygomaticus major – the ‘ smiling muscle ’ that raises the corner of the mouth			0
it also gave readouts for the corrugator supercilii , the ‘ frowning muscle ’ that furrows the brow and is frozen by @entity62			0
the results showed that the volunteers were more likely to scowl in response to a frown from a doctor or someone in a position of power			0
these frowns were also more intense , the @entity72 ’s annual conference in @entity73 heard			0
but it was the volunteers ’ responses to smiling faces that were really telling			0
the ugly truth : @entity20 's research suggests the less appealing reasons why your boss might be smiling at you the men and women who felt powerful tended not to smile back at high - fliers			1
but they did return the smiles of those who were lower down the pecking order – and their smiles were bigger			0
meanwhile , those who felt powerless smiled at everyone , regardless of their rank			1
the researchers think that people who feel powerful try to exert their dominance by not appearing too friendly to those who might be a threat			1
they have no such qualms about appearing approachable to those who lack authority			2
changes in the volunteers ’ expressions were too small to be seen by the eye but mr @entity20 , from the @entity106 , says clearly visible smiles may follow the same pattern			1
he said it is likely that the decision to suppress or return a smile occurs subconsciously .			0

researcher @entity20 found those who feel powerful tend not to smile back at important people
findings suggest this is to avoid appearing *over-friendly* to those who could be a threat
@entity106 study also found those who felt powerless smiled at everyone regardless of rank
