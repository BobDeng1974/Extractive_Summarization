by @entity0 published : 07:41 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 08:06 est , 23 september 2013 the gallantry medal awarded to a bomb disposal novice blown up during the first weeks of the @entity3 has sold at auction for £ 74,500			1
ordinary seaman @entity5 had come to @entity6 to volunteer in a bomb disposal unit , but was tragically killed just a few weeks into the job			1
he was passing tools to this commanding officer @entity10 when he accidentally activated the bomb , giving them both 12 seconds to escape the explosion			1
heroic : ordinary seaman @entity5 ( left ) was killed trying to defuse a @entity15 bomb , for which he was awarded the @entity16 ( right ) sale : @entity18 's @entity16 ( left ) sold for £ 74,500			1
his 1939 - 1945 @entity19 ( right ) also sold in the same lot			1
while @entity22 was able to get behind a nearby bomb shelter , @entity21 was caught up in the blast and died immediately			1
he was awarded the @entity16 , the nation 's second - highest award for gallantry , just three months later			1
the original was sadly stolen in 1945 , but the replacement medal had stayed in the family until it was sold by relatives at @entity32 in @entity6			1
@entity33 , of @entity6 auctioneers @entity34 , said : ' direct wartime awards of the @entity16 are extremely rare , and few of them more evocative or poignant than the example to @entity38			1
' his tragic death might normally have passed with no further comment beyond the bland statement that announced the award of his decoration in the @entity46			2
' unusually , however , his officer , though seriously injured , survived the incident , as a result of which the full story behind @entity38 ’s gallantry later emerged			1
' careful : a bomb disposal officer handles the fuse of an unexploded bomb devastation : @entity3 ravaged @entity6 and tore huge holes in the streets , such as this one seen in front of the @entity59 the bomb disposal units of the @entity61 saved countless lives , and allowed @entity64 's war effort to continue unhindered			1
their exploits were later commemorated in a 1970s tv series called @entity68 - a reference to the warning signs which coated @entity6 to warn passers - by away from the bombs			2
the bomb which killed @entity21 had landed in the @entity74 of @entity6 in the first @entity75 , when @entity76 turned his attention from @entity64 airfields to the capital			1
after the parachute mine buried in a house in @entity6 ’s @entity74 began whirring , he and sub lieutenant @entity10 had 12 seconds to get clear of it			2
the senior officer managed to dive behind a nearby surface air raid shelter and , despite being buried by rubble , survived			1
deadly work : the @entity90 units working in the @entity3 put themselves at huge risk , as shown in this scene from 1970s series @entity68 @entity21 , who only joined the bomb disposal team days before , ran down the street and was struck by flying debris and died instantly			1
he was posthumously awarded the @entity16 which his relatives have now sold at auction for 74,500 pounds			1
@entity21 , from @entity99 , @entity100 , was a married father of one when he was called up for the war in july 1940			1
he volunteered for mine and bomb disposal in september 1940 and died on october 17			1
sub lt @entity104 later wrote of how the two men were called to @entity107 in the @entity74 to a @entity68 that hung suspended from a ceiling of a house just six inches from the floor			2
he said : ' i called my @entity112 ( @entity5 ) into the hallway and explained the position			1
he would remain in the passage and pass me whatever tools i required			2
war effort : bomb disposal officers stopped @entity64 coming to a standstill during @entity121 air raids ' i had been working to detach the keep ring for about a minute when the bomb slipped in front of me			1
i heard the whirr of the bomb mechanism			1
unless i got clear i had exactly 12 seconds to live			2
' i pulled open the door against the weight of planks and i ran			2
i was through the hall in two leaps			2
' i saw my rating running down the street to what he , poor devil , thought was safety			2
' i had no time to use distance for safety and ran across the roadway to a surface air raid shelter opposite			2
i flung myself on its far side , its bulk between me and the house			2
' sub lt @entity104 was pulled out from underneath the demolished shelter unconscious and with a broken back			0
he added : ' my rating was killed			1
he was beheaded by the blast			0
the mine destroyed six streets and it was six weeks before his body was found among the rubble			0
' he was a brave man and left behind a brave widow			0
i saw her receive her husband ’s decoration from @entity159			0
' the @entity16 that sold was actually an official replacement after the original was stolen in 1945			1
@entity18 ’s @entity19 1939 - 45 also sold alongside it			1
throughout the six years of the @entity61 , the men and women of @entity90 faced the continuous challenge of falling bombs - many of which were designed not to explode straight away in order to create more fear and devastation			0
when air raids over @entity64 began , the @entity170 had very little idea of how to defuse the devices , but quickly developed tools and methods to make the explosives safe			1
bombs were actually less deadly than expected - early estimates said the @entity3 would kill almost 2million people , rather than the 55,000 it did - but the consequences were still devastating			0
in saving thousands of civilian lives , 750 of their own number were killed , more than half as many again as the tally of @entity64 aircrew who died during the @entity187			1
vital work : bomb disposal experts tentatively lift a bomb out of the ground once air raids started against @entity64 in earnest , @entity192 personally ordered that @entity90 be given all the resources they needed to carry out their ' highly dangerous ' work			1
by the time @entity3 ended in mid- 1941 , more than 40,000 civilians had been killed , half of them in @entity6			1
more than 190,000 bombs had fallen , 20,000 of them @entity202			0
when peace was declared in may 1945 , the men of @entity90 had defused about 40,000 high explosive bombs , together with some 5,700 butterfly bombs and another 6,900 anti-aircraft shells and incendiaries			0
but their work was far from over			0
between 1950 and 1958 , another 140 @entity202 were disposed of and 150 others discovered			0
the clear - up continues even today , with bombs regularly found on building sites			0
share what you think the comments below have not been moderated			0
@entity217 , @entity218 , @entity64 , 20 hours ago @entity219 , every 's ' does not have to be replaced by a ' z ' , but bombs and missiles are fitted with @entity222			0
the word @entity223 is used to differentiate it from the electrical @entity223			0
@entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , 1 day ago the bomb disposal officer handling the fuse of an unexploded bomb and the experts tentatively lifting a bomb out of the ground are actors from the tv show uxb.the real men who carried out this type of work during the war were the bravest of the @entity242 sometimes carried out this work whilst the bombs were still droping.every single one of them should have received a bravery award @entity247 , @entity6 , @entity64 , 1 day ago - therealscarface , @entity249 , + + + that medal has no real value , but it has all the value in the world in that it represents a man 's life			1
lost in the hope that others might live			0
to dismiss that in the heartless , snappy , immediate world you 'd prefer to exist in would make us truly lost			0
perhaps you already are lost			0
you have no idea of the of the years that man lived and died in			0
do n't comment on that you know nothing of			0
@entity266 , @entity6 , @entity64 , 1 day ago the photo is from the 1970 tv program @entity268 as you can see by the two film crew standing in the background wearing jeans - @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity64 , 23/9/2013 18:16 --- --- --- --- --- --- --- - clockstopper on : ) @entity275 , @entity276 , 1 day ago who bought it ? @entity280 i bet ! @entity281 , @entity282 , 1 day ago please stop this sale of medals ! medals are awarded to the recipient by a by a @entity286 for service @entity287			2
if the recipient or his / her family do not wish to retain said medals , they should be offered to the @entity293 or return with @entity294			0
they are not " trade tokens "			0
@entity296 , @entity297 , 1 day ago there are a lot of much safer jobs that i can think of like @entity302 with out the parachute ! nina , @entity304 , @entity64 , 1 day ago - @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , 23/9/2013 18:24 thank you for your comments - very informative indeed @entity219 , @entity310 , 1 day ago " removing the fuze from it , " fuze ? i think you mean fuse ... ...			0
or does every 's ' have to be replaced with a ' z ' now ? @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , 1 day ago if you thought that rendering unexploded @entity121 bombs safe was dead easy , a simple matter of removing the fuze from it , you 'd be completely wrong			0
what most people do n't know is that quite a few @entity121 bomb fuzes had integrated booby - trap mechanisms inside them			2
these were highly sensitive and would automatically trigger detonation if the bomb was moved even slightly , or if someone tried to remove the fuze from the bomb in an attempt to make it safe			2
in short , these bombs were specifically designed to kill the very men who were tasked with rendering them safe			0
it took great courage to kneel down next to an unexploded bomb knowing that it had been fitted with an anti-handling device that had been put there in the hope of blowing you to shreds			2
some bombs had 2 fuzes fitted			0
one could be a booby - trap fuze and the other might be a clock - work delay , ticking away the seconds until detonation in the next 12 hours or 12 minutes			0
very scary for the men who had to render them safe ! the views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of @entity355			0
by posting your comment you agree to our house rules .			0
