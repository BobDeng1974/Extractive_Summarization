by @entity0 - watson a planned £ 20 million film about @entity3 legend sir @entity2 has been vetoed by his wife over scenes claiming she had an affair with another driver			1
@entity8 had been tipped to play sir @entity2 in the @entity11 blockbuster , made by the couple ’s friend @entity12 , the director of @entity14			1
it has been three years in development			0
the script focused on the close relationship between the @entity19 and @entity21 @entity20 – who died during a formula 1 qualifying race in @entity23 in 1973			1
@entity24 , centre , said a movie about husband sir @entity2 , right , has been shelved because filmmakers wanted to a plot line where she had an affair with the couple 's close friend @entity20 @entity32 refused to allow the affair plotline as it is not true but admitted it was ' probably the most exciting part of the film ' lady @entity24 told @entity36 : ‘ it was going to be a big film – but they wanted to say that i ’d had an affair with @entity20 ... and i would n’t let them do it , because it was n’t true			1
’ @entity32 , now 65 , admitted the affair ‘ was probably the most exciting part of the film – if it was true			2
@entity20 was a great friend of @entity2 ’s and of mine but they wanted to make something of it – which was crazy			1
‘ @entity20 was described as the most exciting man in @entity21 at that time			2
we had great fun with him , he loved the children , he loved everyone that we were with , he had a great girlfriend			0
' but @entity2 and i are childhood sweethearts and we have been happily married for 50 years			0
‘ i met @entity2 when we were 16 and we got married when i was 21			0
we have two children together and nine grandchildren			0
@entity20 , pictured with @entity63 , was considered one of the most exciting men in @entity21 ‘ anyway they ’re not making the film			1
that ’s the sole reason it ’s scrapped – which seems a bit stupid to me seeing as it ’s not true in the first place			0
’ last night a spokesman for @entity12 declined to comment , but a source close to the film insisted that it was still in development and @entity12 and sir @entity2 were still in discussions			1
the @entity80 - nominated director was inspired to bring the story to the big screen after seeing how the couple were affected by the death of @entity20 , whom @entity2 mentored and saw as his successor on the @entity87 team			1
sir @entity2 , 74 , retired from racing after the crash that killed his friend			1

sir @entity2 and @entity32 are childhood sweethearts and have been happily married for 50 years @entity14 director @entity12 was involved in the @entity2 film development last year sir @entity2 talked excitedly about the film as a chance to pay tribute to his protege			1
in an interview , he said : ‘ the film is about @entity24 and me and @entity20 , three people going through an experience in life			2
it will be a @entity11 film			0
‘ we are involved in that i have read the various scripts that have come through with @entity24			0
we want accuracy , of course , but there has to be entertainment as well			0
‘ it is not going to be a hardcore racing film			0
it is going to be a human story from 1970 , when @entity20 came into the team , until he sadly died			2
’ if the film is scrapped , it leaves the path clear for a second production , @entity122 , a documentary about the @entity124 in the early 1970s directed by @entity125			0
it was shot as sir @entity2 prepared for the 1971 @entity124 in @entity127 and was first screened in 1972			2
but a re-edited and remastered version , comparing one of the sport ’s most dangerous eras to the present day , premiered at the @entity132 last month			0
