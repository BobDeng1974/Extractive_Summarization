' yes , i think it 's great he 's doing it , ' the elder @entity7 said on @entity13 , ' produced by @entity14 and broadcast on the @entity16 ) network			1
' he has a good message and he understand free - market economics and i just think that its doing a world of good			2
but i also know the power and strength of the establishment and its a tough row to hoe			0
' but a @entity7 campaign insider familiar with the politician 's decision - making told @entity28 hours later that his father got ahead of himself , saying that ' senator @entity7 has not made a decision yet			1
' former @entity1 congressman @entity2 ( right ) told television host @entity6 that his son , senator @entity7 , has decided to run for president @entity2 ( right ) and his son @entity35 ( left ) have captured the imagination of a small but growing segment of the @entity38 that leans toward libertarian values the father - and - son team , both physicians , are n't the first to both make a bid for the @entity46 presidency			1
@entity48 and his son , @entity49 , both occupied the @entity9 in the @entity50			1
@entity51 and @entity52 were @entity46 's second and sixth chief executives			0
@entity2 has run for the job three times , in 1988 , 2008 and 2012			1
