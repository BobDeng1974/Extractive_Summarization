by @entity0 the country ’s most senior prosecutor last night denied being ‘ on a mission ’ to bring down celebrities as she came under fire over a string of failed court cases			1
@entity8 defended the @entity9 against claims that it was ‘ star struck ’ and had ‘ lost perspective ’ in wrongly pursuing famous suspects			1
she said it was right to prosecute mp @entity16 , who was cleared of rape and a string of other sex charges on thursday – despite several of his ‘ accusers ’ telling the police they did not believe they were victims			1
she also pointed out an 86 per cent prosecution success rate across all cases			1
but last night , detailed figures on sex attacks provided by the @entity9 showed those prosecutions have a much lower success rate			1
some 63 per cent of rape cases ended in a conviction in 2011/12 , meaning more than one in three defendants walked free			2
the success rate was slightly higher for sexual offences , at 77 per cent , but nearly one in four cases still ended in a not guilty verdict			2
mrs @entity8 came under fire from her predecessor as @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , who said prosecutors needed to ‘ keep a cool head ’ when approaching historical abuse cases			1
he told @entity54 : ‘ we do n’t want prosecutors only to bring sure - fire winners , that way lots of guilty people would never be taken to court			2
‘ the more challenging cases need to be prosecuted too , so that the courts can decide			2
what the @entity9 need to avoid , however , is going on a mission and losing perspective			0
this particularly applies to historical cases which have garnered a lot of publicity			2
you have to keep a cool head			0
’ the @entity16 verdict followed not guilty decisions in the cases of @entity76 stars @entity77 and @entity78			1
during mr @entity16 ’s trial , the court heard three of his seven alleged victims did not consider an offence had been committed against them , a fourth ‘ had a bit of a giggle ’ about the mp ’s supposed assault , while a fifth wanted to withdraw his allegation about what he called ‘ a drunken misunderstanding ’			1
mrs @entity8 pointed to evidence from the charity @entity91 that suggested those who are ‘ groomed ’ may not think they are victims because their abusers ‘ love them and take care of them ’			1
however , the charity said its research applied only to child victims , and all the ‘ victims ’ in the @entity16 case were adults			1
mrs @entity8 said the @entity9 had made the ‘ right decision ’ to take the @entity16 case before the court and denied prosecuting ‘ weak ’ cases			1
she told the @entity107 : ‘ we apply the same test no matter who the offender or the victim is , and it ’s very important that we do that			0
so i certainly do n’t think that the @entity9 has been star struck in any way			0
we looked at all the evidence and decided there was a realistic prospect of conviction			0
and what we have to remember is that juries apply a very different , much higher test , which is – are they satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt ? ’ a married @entity125 activist , brought to court as one of @entity16 ' alleged victims , has told of his astonishment that he had to give evidence about an incident that was simply a ' bit of a laugh ' ‘ what we do know , and there is evidence from @entity136 ’s and others that shows this , is that victims themselves may not always think of themselves as victims , it rather depends on the relationship they are in with their alleged abusers			1
so if someone is in a position of power , or perhaps we have seen it in grooming cases where victims think they are not victims because their abusers love them and take care of them			2
‘ so i think we should be very careful just to say , “ people do n’t think they are victims and therefore they are not ”			0
’ former prisons minister @entity154 told @entity155 there were ‘ no winners in this process ’ and called for the @entity9 to examine their procedures			0
former labour justice secretary @entity160 told @entity155 that before the revelations about @entity164 , public figures ‘ got the benefit of the doubt ’			1
‘ i think probably these days if you are a public figure then the balance is going to swing the other way , ’ he said			2
speaking at the end of the trial , @entity16 said he had ' gone through 11 months of hell ' after he was cleared of committing nine sexual offences against seven young men			1
outside @entity174 , @entity16 said : ' can i first start by passing on my condolences to one of the jurors whose father died during the trial			1
my deepest condolences to him and his family			0
' can i also thank my legal team ...			2
i thank them for their support during this trial			0
' as many of you know i 've gone through 11 months of hell			0
cleared : @entity16 addresses the media after being cleared of rape and sexual assault ' i 've not been alone			1
many have walked with me including my team at @entity194 and @entity195 , my constituency association , my family , my friends , my constituents and indeed many people who i do n't even know have sent messages of support			2
' in my darkest and loneliest times , there were only two or one set of footprints in the sand			0
those of you of faith will know , they were n't mine			0
' the fact is i 've got work to do			0
it 's the work that i 've done for the last 22 years so this is n't a time for celebration or euphoria			0
' @entity77 just a few weeks ago from this very spot said there are no winners in these cases and that 's absolutely right there are no winners , so no celebrations			0
' but the fact is i 've got work to do , work that i 've done for the last 22 years			0
all i can say is that after the last 11 months that i 've gone through , nothing will ever be the same again			0
