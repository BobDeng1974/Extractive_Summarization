the melting @entity2 sea ice could open up new areas for fishing that run the danger of being completely unregulated , experts have warned			1
yesterday it was revealed how in just 40 years the @entity2 could be ' ice - free ' as temperatures in polar regions rise faster than predicted			1
and this could open up the previously inaccessible offshore @entity2 coast , giving fisherman access to whole new ecosystems - without any constraints in place			2
as @entity2 sea ice melts , new regions will open up to fisherman ( stock image shown )			1
the @entity19 said the @entity20 must get involved			2
within these regions , the populations of fish are unknown			2
this could lead to over-fishing if the practice goes unregulated the latest warning came from the @entity19			1
they said that potentially uncontrolled fishing in the @entity2 's international waters raised serious concerns about fish stocks in the region			2
they called for fishing in the central @entity35 to be banned , until a recognised management regime could be agreed			0
the @entity2 could be completely free of ice in just 40 years as a result of global warming , one of the world 's leading climate change experts has warned			1
this would cause sea levels to rise to nearly unmanageable levels			0
@entity47 winner professor @entity46 , from the @entity48 in @entity49 , said there is evidence that temperatures are rising four times faster in the frozen region than the rest of the planet			0
it should be noted that ' ice - free ' does not mean it will be devoid of ice			1
rather , an area ( or grid ) is said to be ice - free when it has lower than a 15 per cent ice concentration , enough for a ship to pass through			1
but the change would still be dramatic			0
he forecasts that the region will see temperature rises of up to 7 Â° c within a century			0
' for several reasons , the @entity2 climate change is more intense and faster than in other regions			0
there is a reduction in snow and ice cover , which has a protective function , ' he said			0
predictions suggest that the @entity2 will be soon be ice - free , although it should be noted this does not mean it will be devoid of ice			1
rather , an area ( or grid ) is said to be ice - free when it has lower than a 15 per cent ice concentration , enough for a ship to pass through			1
the committee urged the @entity20 to appoint an ambassador for the @entity2 - as @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 have done - to ensure its influence there			2
considering that much of the @entity35 is inaccessible , the population of various species of fish in the region is unknown			0
as summer ice continues to fall , opening up the region , this raises the prospect of over-fishing becoming a problem , as if commercial fishing is allowed , the effect it is having will not be clear			0
' the @entity2 is changing in front of our eyes			0
that change is momentous and unprecedented , ' said the committee 's chairman , @entity107			0
' it will bring both difficulties and opportunities and it is vital that the @entity20 takes this challenge seriously and is able to respond to it - indeed , is positioned as the premier partner for @entity2 states and other interests in @entity2 co-operation as that change happens			2
' we also have serious concerns about the potential opening up of fishing in the central @entity35 caused by a reduction in sea ice			1
' we are calling for a ban on fishing there at least until more research is undertaken and we have a better understanding of the eco-systems that will be affected			0
' we need to get a proper management regime in place for the central @entity35 now , before the area is opened to the risk of over-fishing			2
' yeseterday it was reported that the @entity2 could be completely free of ice in just 40 years as a result of global warming , according to one of the world 's leading climate change experts , professor @entity46			1
this map shows rates of erosion on the @entity2 coast , with the fastest rates marked in red the extent of @entity2 sea ice has rapidly declined in the last few decades , as shown in this graph from the @entity153 ( @entity153 )			1
this means more and more regions are likely to open up to ships as the @entity2 becomes ice - free - running the risk of over-fishing the @entity20 has a long history of successfully engaging with the @entity2 , as its ' closest neighbour ' , but the government 's approach is too hesitant and cautious in the face of other countries being assertive about their interests , a report by the committee said			1
and the peers warned that with @entity171 's foreign policy becoming increasingly hard to predict , efforts should be made to insulate the @entity2 from other geopolitical tensions because of a ' global interest in protecting this unusually vulnerable environment '			0
the @entity20 , the most northern country below the @entity175 , should play an active role in managing fishing opportunities which are likely to open in previously inaccessible areas as sea ice retreats and fish stocks move north			1
potentially uncontrolled fishing in the @entity2 's international waters raises serious concerns about fish stocks in the region , the @entity181 warned , and called for a moratorium on fishing in the central @entity35 until a recognised management regime could be agreed			2
meanwhile , the recent fall in world energy prices may limit exploitation of the potentially vast oil and gas supplies in the @entity2 in the short to medium term , offering a ' window of opportunity ' to examine if extraction can be done safely and responsibly and under agreed international standards			0
the committee also concluded it was a matter of ' when ' , not ' if ' , the @entity2 would be free of sea ice in summer			1
warming in the @entity2 raised the prospect of additional climate change caused by the release of methane gas from the seabed and melting permafrost , as well as other impacts such as altering the jet stream and bringing more extreme weather to the @entity20			0
@entity181 called for increased funding for @entity20 @entity2 science , and an examination of potential methane releases as part of a dedicated @entity2 research programme .			0

as @entity2 sea ice melts , new regions will open up to fisherman
the @entity19 said the @entity20 must get involved
within these regions , the populations of fish are unknown
this could lead to over-fishing if the practice goes unregulated
the committee says all fishing in the @entity35 should be banned until proper rules and regulations can be put in place
comes after warning that the @entity2 could be ' ice - free ' in 40 years
