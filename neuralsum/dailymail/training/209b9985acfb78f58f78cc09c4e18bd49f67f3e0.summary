by @entity0 rushing around the room in a wide - eyed frenzy , knocking over the nest of tables on which my canapes had been neatly arranged and upon which my dismayed guests had rested their flutes of champagne , my son @entity11 , then 11 , was making @entity12 2012 a night to remember for all the wrong reasons			1
worse , it was all my fault			0
earlier in the evening , i had served a sweet - and - sour chicken @entity16 takeaway — a family favourite — to @entity11 , his twin brother , @entity19 , and their sister , @entity20			0
my husband , @entity23 , and i had had the same , and we ’d all tucked into chocolate pudding afterwards			0
every mother will recognise this scenario			0
sweet : @entity0 decided to switch her sons ' diet but found it had more sugar an indulgent meal as a treat , followed by an over-excited child who , quite literally , bounces off the walls			1
but @entity11 ’s reaction to sugar was more than just excitement			1
and , from watching my son carefully , i could see that his worst episodes of bad behaviour and hyperactivity took place after he ’d had a sugar binge			1
so , that very night , i decided to reform my family ’s eating habits			1
out with the sugary cereals and sweet treats , and in with wholegrains and cereal bars			0
i even ditched cow ’s milk for the soya alternative			1
such a change in diet was the only thing i could think of that might put @entity11 on a more even keel — and improve my entire family ’s health in the process			1
after all , if an occasional sugar splurge could have such a dramatic impact on him , what was it doing to the rest of us ? so imagine my horror on reading yesterday ’s findings that many of the ‘ healthy ’ alternatives i ’d started to buy were actually doing my family more damage than before			1
indeed , doctors and academics are so horrified by the hidden sugar epidemic they ’ve dubbed sugar ‘ the new tobacco ’			1
the @entity83 ’s recommended daily allowance ( @entity84 ) is 90g of sugar per day — 22.5 teaspoons			1
@entity11 ’s typical menu before gave him an overall daily total of 121.3 grams of sugar — a whopping 30 - odd teaspoons			1
but i now realise the so - called healthy diet is even worse			0
thanks to sugars hidden in them , i have managed to push his sugar content up to 152 grams each day — the same as 38 teaspoons			1
@entity11 ’s behaviour had been deteriorating since just after he turned ten			1
as a toddler , it was far easier to control his diet , and rather than sugary drinks , he would have only water or milk			0
the tantrums were few and far between			0
but as he grew older , he wanted what the other boys at school were having			0
brand - name cereals , cartoon - branded juice drinks , and so on			0
and i ’m ashamed to admit that every day he would eat the following : @entity109 for cereal , peanut butter on crumpets as a snack and a @entity115 drink after school			1
and while i tried always to prepare healthy dinners , if i did n’t have time to cook from scratch , i would resort to ready - meals			0
it was n’t ideal , but i made sure that i chose the very best , high - end options			0
surely it could n’t do much harm ? but by the age of 11 , these treats were taking their toll on @entity11 ’s behaviour			1
making him spend just 45 minutes reading or doing homework would leave him angry and temperamental			0
copybooks were often thrown across the room ( by him ) and our dining - room table was regularly banged in frustration ( me and him )			0
so our new regime began			0
the chocolate breakfast cereal was out and i brought in what i thought was a healthy alternative — oat - based cereal flakes			0
we ditched the white bread sandwiches and started having veggie soups and wholemeal bread for lunch			0
ready - meals were ditched for home - cooked meat and vegetable stir - fries that used delicious shop - made sauces			0
i thought i would win the war on sugar			1
talking to registered nutritionist @entity151 , i have learned the bitter truth about my children ’s sugar intake			1
these so - called healthy options contain so many hidden sugars that my son ’s diet is actually worse than before			1
‘ a little sugar wo n’t do any harm , ’ @entity151 tells me			1
‘ but some foods lower their fat contents , enabling manufacturers to bill them as “ healthy ” , and then add sugar to make them taste better			1
‘ it ’s only when you inspect the food labels , which most parents do n’t , that you realise you are being misled			1
‘ the recommended daily limit of sugar for an adult female is 90g , which is the same as for a boy of 12 , like @entity11			1
but the lower you can get your sugar intake , while still enjoying your diet , the better			2
’ @entity0 was shocked to discover that a can of @entity178 soup contains 14.9g of sugar @entity151 found that swapping the obviously sugar - loaded cereals , like @entity109 , which has nearly five teaspoons per 40g bowl with semi-skimmed milk , for the same amount of @entity184 and @entity185 with ‘ healthy ’ soya milk , still delivered 2.65 teaspoons of sugar			1
‘ it may be sold as “ healthy ” , but @entity184 and @entity185 still has 19g of sugar per 100g			2
@entity189 guidelines suggest that anything containing over 22.5g of sugar per 100g is “ high ”			2
so while this is n’t technically over , it ’s close — and not the healthy option people think , ’ says @entity151			2
‘ it ’s wiser to choose porridge			2
better still , scrambled egg with mushrooms or tomatoes is a lower - sugar start to the day			1
’ so what about our new healthy lunch with cheese sandwiches ditched in favour of vegetable soups , with tuna and sweetcorn sandwiches made with wholegrain bread			0
@entity11 ’s favourite soup was @entity178 tomato			2
but i am stunned to discover that this contains 14.9g of sugar , per 300ml can — equivalent to almost four teaspoons			2
while i thought i ’d picked a truly healthy sandwich , @entity151 tells me that it contains more than a teaspoon of sugar , thanks to the wholemeal bread			2
my healthy drinks also got the thumbs - down			0
our new breakfast drink was a pre-packaged orange , mango and passionfruit smoothie , which i thought would help our vitamin intake without adding too much sugar			2
wrong , as @entity151 tells me : ‘ it contains 19.5g of sugar in a 250ml serving , which is four teaspoons of sugar			2
that ’s more than a fifth of the daily @entity84 in a single drink			1
’ i ’d also swapped the @entity237 drinks for a glass of @entity240 fresh orange juice			0
i need not have bothered			0
‘ a 200ml glass of orange juice contains 20g of sugar — almost exactly the same as the 22g of sugar within the @entity115 , ’ says @entity151			2
‘ that ’s five teaspoons in just one glass			2
you are far better sticking to water or milk			0
one small glass of fruit juice in one day is enough			2
’ @entity11 ’s original after - school snack was peanut butter on a crumpet , which contained more than a teaspoon of sugar			1
i ’d ditched the peanut butter — too many additives and syrups , i thought — for the more natural - seeming honey , served on a bagel			0
@entity151 says : ‘ there ’s a massive 11g of sugar in just two teaspoons of honey			1
and added to the 5.1g of sugar which is part of every bagel recipe , you are loading @entity11 with more than three teaspoons of sugar in just one snack			2
’ and while i had been feeling smug that i no longer have any sort of posh ready - meal in my supermarket trolley , i would have been better off sticking with them			0
i had replaced them with shop - bought stir - fry sauces with fresh meat and veg to make quick dinners feel more ‘ home - made ’			0
what an error ! these sauces are packed with sugar , too			2
@entity151 says : ‘ while overall this is a healthy meal , you could choose a better option by checking the label			0
those with sweet chilli contain more sugar			0
your favourite black bean sauce contains 7.7g sugar per half jar — almost two teaspoons			0
’ so , despite my best efforts , @entity11 has still been consuming 38 teaspoons of sugar per day — almost 16 more than his allowance			1
i am horrified by these results			0
by opting for home cooking , what i had thought were low - sugar breakfast options and snacks , i was actually doing more harm to my children ’s health than good .			1
