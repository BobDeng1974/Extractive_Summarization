by @entity0 published : 13:26 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 13:57 est , 4 january 2013 most of the new pieces of gold and silver unearthed in the field where the @entity6 was found three years ago has been declared treasure trove			1
the 81 items , which date back to the 7th century , will now be handed to the @entity12 ’s valuation committee , which will value them , an inquest in @entity9 was told			1
@entity13 will then be charged with raising the money to buy the new items for the nation			1
unearthed : most of a collection of new items , including this helmet , has been declared treasure trove			1
around 90 new pieces of gold and silver were found near where the @entity6 was found in 2009 eighty - one of the items were declared treasure trove			1
they include part of a helmet , an eagle and a cross			0
if the money is raised , the pieces are likely to be displayed in museums alongside the original @entity6 , which was found in a field near @entity37 in 2009 by metal detectorist @entity6			1
mr @entity6 and landowner and local farmer @entity39 will divide any proceeds from the sale of the new find in the same way they did with the original hoard			1
the second haul was discovered by a team from @entity48			0
but mr @entity6 and mr @entity39 will benefit because they were were behind the original discovery , the coroner said			2
the original hoard , which contained 3,900 items , was bought for £ 3.3 million with the help of public donations and has since been seen by tens of thousands of people			1
original find : this strip of gold bearing a @entity60 biblical inscription was part of the original @entity6 found in 2009 by @entity6 the new find is only expected to cost a fraction of that figure			2
evidence was given in the coroner ’s court by dr @entity68 , an archaeological finds specialist who catalogued the original hoard and the new items , and principal archaeologist for @entity74			1
mr @entity74 said the new finds were ‘ closely related ’ to the original contents of the @entity6			0
he said : ‘ it all fits very tightly with the @entity6			0
' he described how a team of archaeologists returned to the field in november last year and in two phases recovered the pieces from the ground , including gold and silver items , hilt rivets and pommel caps from swords and small fragments of metal discs , made of either copper alloy or base silver			2
the most interesting finds included an eagle mount - whose use is not known - and a cheek piece from a helmet			0
if enough money is raised , the new discoveries will go on display in museums with the original @entity103 ( pictured ) mr @entity104 asked mr @entity74 why these pieces had not been found with the main hoard three years earlier			1
he said : ‘ it is thought a lot of ploughing has brought material up , but i think we are now in the diminishing returns			0
‘ in 2009 , we uncovered 3,900 items and now this time 90 items - i believe we have now recovered everything in the topsoil			2
’ dr @entity68 agreed there was little chance of any more finds coming from the field			0
he was asked to comment on three items which were eventually ruled not be treasure , because they were all found some distance from the @entity6 site			2
dr @entity68 said one of those pieces - a metal fragment with a stylised design - was similar to a piece found at the @entity133 excavation in @entity134 and was of ‘ high status ’			2
dr @entity68 said that the finds had ‘ roused the public ’s interest ’ in a period of history which had until recently been considered the @entity141			0
the discovery , circled in red , was made in the same field where the @entity6 , the largest collection of @entity147 treasure was recovered in 2009 he said : ‘ this is a period which runs for twice that of the @entity151 period , and which shows @entity147 were highly cultured			0
' some of the gold in the pieces from the original @entity6 could be traced to @entity154 in modern - day @entity155 , and the gems to @entity158 and @entity159 , showing the @entity147 to be accomplished traders			1
at the end of the hearing , mr @entity104 ruled 10 of the total of 91 items discovered in phased investigations starting on november 19 , 2012 , were not to be considered treasure because they were modern ‘ waste ’ material			0
these items will all be returned to the owner and finder			0
mr @entity104 concluded : ‘ the @entity6 was a magnificent find and i very much hope these items can be saved for the nation and added to the hoard			1
’ @entity177 , @entity13 leader , said the council together with the owners of the original hoard , @entity181 and @entity182 , would now have to look at raising money to buy the new items			1
he said : ‘ i am hopeful the public will step in as they did previously			0
‘ we did have to raise £ 3.3 million in 12 weeks last time , and on that occasion the public came forward with nearly £ 1 million			0
‘ i think there will be the same hunger this time around			0

eighty - one pieces dating back to 7th century unearthed at the same site
it is up to @entity13 to buy the new items for the nation
if money is raised , collection likely to be displayed alongside original hoard
