scientists are having extraordinary success treating cancer with new vaccines they believe could be a ‘ game - changer ’ in the battle against the disease			1
they have worked out how to teach the body ’s immune system to identify cancer cells , allowing patients to be primed to destroy cancer			1
in one case an @entity12 woman given just weeks to live was cleared of advanced blood cancer			1
she is still alive three years later , and her doctor says she is not a one - off			1
scientists are having extraordinary success treating cancer with new vaccines they believe could be a ‘ game - changer ’ in the battle against the disease @entity22 researchers are now working on a related approach			2
both methods involve taking t - cells , which fight infection , and giving them the ability to recognise a special tag on the surface of cancer cells , called the @entity33 protein			1
the research is being carried out on patients with leukaemia			2
but the scientists hope their vaccines will eventually be used to fight many types of cancer , including that of breast , bowel and prostate – whose cells tend to have @entity33 on their surfaces			2
there is even talk of a ‘ universal cancer vaccine ’ among some scientists , although the researchers themselves believe that is unlikely			2
the treatments aim to help the immune system seek out and destroy cancer cells they do this by giving t - cells the ability to detect a key marker called @entity33 search and destroy : t - cells can be taught to identify and then kill cancer cells @entity33 is a protein found on the surface of the cells of many types of cancer t - cells are a type of white blood cell , which fight infections or threats an infusion of donor stem cells – which can transform into t - cells – may also be used to boost the immune system over the past three years , specialist @entity78 , of the @entity79 in @entity80 , has treated 15 plasma cell leukaemia patients with t - cells taught to recognise cancer			1
the disease can be treated with chemotherapy - like drugs but it tends to keep returning			2
all 15 were expected to die within months given normal treatment			0
but following his regime , dr @entity78 revealed ‘ about half ’ were still alive			0
he said : ‘ i strongly feel this is a game - changer			0
before treatment , i talked to these patients and they said to me : “ i have no choice , let ’s try this			0
” they had extremely limited life expectancy			0
a year later , they call me from work and say they are too busy to see me			0
’ his treatment involves taking bone marrow from a donor and splitting it into stem cells and t - cells			2
the patient receives the stem cells straight away but the t - cells are sensitised to @entity33 in the lab by exposing them to fragments of the protein			1
the t - cells are then given to the patient in a series of injections over several months			1
dr @entity78 ’s first patient , graphic designer @entity118 , 64 , underwent the procedure in 2012 after being so ill following a relapse and intensive chemotherapy that she was ‘ comatose ’			0
but after receiving the stem cells and four t - cell doses , her cancer was reduced to undetectable levels			1
dr @entity78 said that seeing her ‘ in good health and in complete remission ’ was ‘ clearly an extraordinary experience ’			0
in the @entity22 study , led by dr @entity131 – a haematologist at @entity132 and the @entity133 , t - cells from up to 20 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or chronic myeloid leukaemia are to be extracted , inserted with dna so they recognise @entity33 , and then put back again			1
‘ most people have immune cells which ca n’t recognise cancer cells , which is one of the major problems with tackling the disease , ’ dr @entity141 explained			1
‘ we have genetically engineered patients ’ immune cells so they develop receptors for the @entity33 protein , making them much better at recognising leukaemia cells			1
’ one patient has already received an infusion containing genetically engineered ’ t - cells and there are others whose cells are being prepared			1
the dna is transferred into the t - cells using a ‘ dummy ’ virus that does not cause an infection			2
these then provide the blueprint to build the @entity33 receptor			0
three years ago , @entity118 , was on death ’s door having relapsed with an aggressive version of myeloma , a form of blood cancer			1
she was put in touch with dr @entity78 at @entity80 ’s @entity79 , who suggested the vaccine			0
first , she was given stem cells from her brother @entity175 ’s bone marrow			0
next , his t - cells were exposed to @entity33 protein			2
finally , she received the cells in a series of injections			0
at first , recovery was slow			0
but within two months she began to feel ‘ consistently better ’ and was allowed home			0
@entity118 was on death 's door with a form of blood cancer when a doctor suggested the vaccine book designer mrs @entity118 , 64 , from @entity189 , @entity190 , said the treatment meant she was well enough to garden , walk her dog , and go canoeing			1
last summer she did relapse , but she is in remission again thanks to a new drug			0
dr @entity78 is also considering another t - cell injection			0
ms @entity118 said : ‘ it ’s a wonder , a miracle that i ’m still here			0
’ in the short term , doctors are looking to see if these super-immune cells will be powerful enough to stop leukaemia patients from relapsing after chemotherapy			1
but scientists also hope this approach might work to help treat a range of other cancers too			0
dr @entity141 , whose research with professor @entity210 has been funded by the charity @entity212 and @entity213 and government body @entity214 , said : ‘ we could potentially use it in ovarian cancer , breast cancer , and patients with prostate or colon cancer too			1
’ she said the approach should produce less side effects than chemotherapy and provide longer - term protection than drugs , which are flushed out of the body in days or weeks , because immune cells have a ‘ memory ’ , persisting at low levels in case a threat re-emerges			1
the hope is that the genetically engineered t - cells will do this with cancer , said dr @entity141 , ‘ multiplying again if needed – like an army ready to be reactivated ’			2
however , dr @entity238 of @entity239 , struck a note of caution : ‘ these treatments are still in the early stages of clinical trials , and although some people have had great responses , they have n’t worked for everyone			0

experts find way of teaching body 's immune system to identify cancer cells
the new medical advance allows patients to be primed to destroy cancers
in one case , woman given weeks to live cleared of advanced blood cancer
@entity12 patient still alive three years later , and doctors say she is not a one - off
