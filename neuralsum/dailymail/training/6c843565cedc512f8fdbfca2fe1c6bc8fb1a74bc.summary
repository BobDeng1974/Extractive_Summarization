there is a photograph of @entity2 alongside @entity3 and @entity4 in the @entity5 in @entity6 taken in 2006			1
the teenage trio were the future of @entity9 , promoted to the senior squad for a @entity12 tie against @entity13			1
show that photo to any @entity9 fan today and they will give you the names of the two boys who went on to become @entity21 internationals			1
as for the third lad , well only reserve - team anoraks could identify him			2
@entity2 ( right ) pictured alongside @entity9 teammates @entity3 ( left ) and @entity4 in 2006 @entity2 , pictured in 2006 , struggled with the @entity25 winter after leaving the @entity27 heat in @entity28 travel 10,000 miles or so to @entity28 , however , and that same player is just about the most recognised sportsman in the country right now			1
for @entity2 , now 26 and on the books of @entity33 , no less , was the scorer of the winning goal in the final of last month ’s @entity37 to give the @entity38 – including the likes of @entity40 and @entity41 - their first piece of major silverware in front of 76 , 385 home fans			1
in the 48 hours which followed that victory over @entity48 , @entity2 was everywhere – television , radio , the front and back page of every national newspaper			1
ten years earlier , his family – dad @entity56 , mum @entity54 and younger brother @entity55 – took out credit and left home in @entity59 to support the two - footed attacking midfielder in his soccer venture in the @entity62 of @entity21			2
he was earning just £ 100 a week and walked to training every day , where the likes of @entity65 and @entity66 were team - mates			2
meanwhile , the @entity56 home in @entity28 was just two weeks away from being lost to debt collectors			1
@entity2 ( right ) was offered a trial at @entity9 after impressing in a friendly while on tour his family emigrated from @entity28 to @entity25 to support his career at @entity76 it is , then , understandable how much that extra-time goal at @entity79 ’s @entity28 meant to @entity2 and his family			1
‘ to make my mum and dad so proud was payback for everything we ’ve been through and all of the support they ’ve given me , they left everything behind for me when we moved to @entity9 , ’ @entity2 tells @entity81 having now returned to @entity83 loan club @entity82 , where earlier this season he scored a @entity85 lob from 45 yards which became an internet viral and netted another stunner against @entity89 which sparked a riot among disgruntled fans			1
‘ it was massive for @entity103 football and my name will always be on the goal which won us our first @entity37 ( the equivalent of @entity108 )			1
‘ the whole country was celebrating			0
i ’ve never felt like that before			0
it felt like i was the most famous person in @entity28 – it was pretty full - on and my phone never stopped			1
‘ i flew back to @entity83 a few days later and back to reality – but scoring that goal was the stuff of dreams			2
’ @entity2 in action for @entity9 during a pre season friendly against @entity118 in july 2007 @entity2 's trial with the club was in front of @entity123 legend @entity122 ( left ) and manager @entity124 so how did the @entity2 family end up on @entity25 ? when @entity2 was 10 , @entity56 set up the @entity126 in @entity59 – which used stick fighting and martial arts to strengthen their youngsters – and during a tour of @entity131 in 2003 they played @entity9			1
@entity2 impressed and was invited back for a trial in front of @entity122 and current head coach @entity124			1
he won the offer of a scholarship and the family took the bold decision to emigrate			0
‘ it was a dream move and an amazing opportunity , but it was tough , ’ he says			0
‘ it was a big change			0
we left home in december when it was nearly 40c and then you get to @entity9 and it is freezing			1
‘ we then nearly lost the house in @entity28			2
my dad got a job as an accountant and my mum worked in @entity149 , the department store in town			0
‘ it was n’t until i got my professional contract ( a £ 1,500 - per - week deal in 2008 ) that things got easier			0
‘ but i was doing well and thought i would make it			0
@entity157 , @entity3 and @entity4 were the three players coming through			0
i was on the bench a lot and training with the big boys every day			0
‘ i got on really well with @entity163 ( the @entity164 international ) and he could see i was frustrated at not playing			2
i needed to move on			0
@entity165 did me a big favour by waiving the compensation owed to the club and @entity163 recommended i go to @entity164 , where he put a good word in			2
’ @entity2 was close with @entity163 ( right ) at @entity9 , who recommended he try playing in the @entity164 league now 26 , the @entity103 is on the books at @entity33 but has been loaned out to co-owned @entity173 after three years at @entity9 , @entity2 signed for @entity174 in the @entity164 top flight and during his first season scored a match - winning hat - trick against @entity179			1
his name was noted and top - five @entity179 duly signed him on a four - year deal			0
but @entity33 were watching , too			0
‘ i had four brilliant years in @entity164			2
i was scoring goals and got a call - up to the national side and then there was word that @entity33 were interested , ’ says @entity2 , who now speaks @entity182 , @entity164 and @entity183 , although admits his accent still betrays a @entity186 twang			1
‘ it was strange and @entity193 but felt like the recognition i deserved			0
i went over to @entity195 , had the tour of the stadium and had my medical there			0
‘ but the deal was a co-ownership with @entity200 and i was sent there during my first season			0
i hardly played and it was my lowest time in football , that ’s not what i went for			0
’ relief came when @entity33 bought out his contract for 1million euros and he – and his family - returned to @entity28 for a loan season at @entity212 - 35 appearances and 15 goals later and he had won a seat on the plane to the @entity215 in @entity216			1
after thriving at @entity9 , @entity3 went on to break transfer records at both @entity218 and @entity219 @entity4 ( left ) , now at @entity220 , has earned a place in @entity223 's @entity21 squad @entity2 was the scorer of the winning goal in the final of last month ’s @entity37 for @entity28 ‘ i ’ve got an @entity182 and @entity183 background , so for us it was always football			1
i remember the 1994 @entity215 and being fascinated by @entity232 , but you never think you ’ll play at one yourself , ’ says @entity2 , who played against @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 – the best he has ever faced – at the @entity229			1
‘ our group – @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 - was incredibly hard			0
we did n’t get any points but we did n’t disgrace ourselves and the aim now , for me , is to get to the next @entity215			0
‘ it ’s been some journey so far but i ’m still young and i ’m excited about the future			0
who knows what will happen ? there has been a lot of interest recently but i ’m pretty open - minded			0
’ in the meantime he is answerable to @entity33 – where his contract expires in 2016 – and the immediate future is chasing @entity131 football with @entity253			0
there , in a city of just 35,000 , he is still relatively unknown , just as he was during three years in @entity9			2
when he returns to his @entity59 home in the summer , however , the last thing he can expect is anonymity			2
for in @entity28 , @entity2 is a national hero			1
@entity2 played alongside @entity40 ( left ) and @entity258 's @entity41 ( right ) at the @entity37 @entity2 's goal lead to captain @entity40 lifting the trophy for the @entity38 in front of 76 , 385 home fans			1

@entity2 impressed during a trial with @entity9 in 2006
@entity2 moved from @entity9 to the @entity164 league , where he thrived
@entity2 returned to @entity28 to play for @entity212
last month , he scored the goal in the final of the @entity37 in front of 76 , 385 home fans , *securing* the trophy for the @entity38
