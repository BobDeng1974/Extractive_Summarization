@entity0 are expected to turn a near - £ 50million loss reported in 2013 into a profit last season - figures that the club are confident will mean they avoid any sanctions from @entity6 for financial fair play rule breaches			1
@entity6 has announced that @entity0 are one of seven clubs who did not play in @entity14 competition last season who are under investigation for potential @entity8 breaches			1
@entity0 manager @entity19 said the club were ' comfortable ' with @entity6 's action and it is understood the 2013 - 14 figures will show a profit when they are formally announced in the spring			2
that is a significant turnaround given that @entity0 made a loss of £ 49.8million for the 2012 - 13 season , and £ 40.5million for the 10 - month period before that			0
@entity0 manager @entity19 speaks to his players during training at @entity30 on thursday @entity6 's @entity8 rules dictate that losses must be restricted to £ 35.4million over a two - year window so ending the 2013 - 14 season in the black - thanks to a combination of the bumper new @entity37 tv deal , commercial income increases and cost - cutting - will be a huge boost to efforts to avoid sanctions			1
the @entity45 club will also aim to write off a big chunk of losses as allowable stadium expenditure - the 2011 - 12 accounts reported that £ 49.6million was associated with @entity0 's stadium costs , £ 35million coming from former co-owner @entity51 's aborted plan to build a new stadium on @entity53 which current owners @entity54 had to scrap			2
@entity6 announced that @entity0 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 are all being subjected to investigations relating to ' potential break - even breaches '			1
@entity0 hope to write off a big chunk of losses last season as allowable stadium expenditure @entity19 said : ' it 's obviously something that will be dealt with by the directors			0
it 's something we 're comfortable with because we 're great advocates of financial fair play			0
it 's ongoing with the club			0
' @entity6 will not withhold any @entity76 or @entity77 money from those clubs , but prize money has been held back from five clubs - @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 - as a result of ' over-due payables ' - non-payments to other clubs , players and / or tax authortities			0
a @entity6 statement read : ' the @entity92 ( club financial control body ) has opened formal investigations into seven clubs as they disclosed a break - even deficit on the basis of their financial reporting periods ending in 2012 and 2013			0
a new bumper @entity37 tv deal could help @entity0 avoid @entity6 sanctions ' these clubs will need to submit additional monitoring information during october and november upon the deadlines set by the @entity92 , subsequent to which an additional communication shall be made and conservatory measures may be imposed			2
' @entity108 and @entity109 were the clubs hit hardest by @entity6 last season for breaching @entity8 rules - they were each fined £ 49million and handed restrictions on transfer spending and a reduction in @entity76 squad size			1
@entity6 said the impact of @entity8 was showing positive results			0
@entity0 have invested heavily in the squad to tackle @entity37 and @entity76 commitments the statement continued : ' the introduction of the @entity6 club licensing and financial fair play regulations has already had a very positive impact on the scale of overdue payables , as they have decreased from 57 million euros in june 2011 to eight million euros in june 2014			2
' in addition , aggregate losses reported by @entity6 's first - division clubs in the 2013 financial year have gone down to 800million euros from a record - reported deficit of 1.7 billion euros in 2011			1
