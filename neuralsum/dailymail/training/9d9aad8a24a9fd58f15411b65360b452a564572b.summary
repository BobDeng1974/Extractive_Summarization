by @entity0 the @entity2 airline pilots who dramatically avoided a high - speed collision with a grounded plane as they came in to land have criticised their opposite numbers for pulling out in front of them			1
shocking footage of the near - miss , which took place at @entity11 on saturday , shows a @entity12 767 , flown by @entity2 airline @entity13 , swooping in over the runway			1
but as the plane bears down on the tarmac , a seemingly oblivious @entity19 taxis in front of the incoming jet , which pulls up sharply to avoid disaster			0
commenting on the dramatic procedure to the @entity42 , the plane 's co-pilot @entity39 also criticsed the @entity45 airport 's traffic controllers for falling silent during the disaster , leaving them to handle the dangerous situation themselves			1
he said : ' before getting close to the runway we heard the air traffic controller 's command allowing @entity53 to cross the runway after we had landed '			1
' the @entity53 repeated the comment which meant that they heard and accepted it			0
but then suddenly - and without a clear reason - the @entity53 got onto the runway just as our altitude was going below 100 metres			1
' the air traffic controller clearly got confused			2
he went silent ... we had nothing else to do than go on a second round			0
' we have worked on this situation many times during training			0
' @entity66 , the captain of the plane , said the incident ' could have been serious if the weather was not clear as it was on that day '			0
he also criticsed traffic controllers , saying : ' as we were getting ready to land , about 10 , 15 seconds prior to reaching the rear end of the runway , we noticed the @entity53 @entity73 moving at 60 degrees towards the runway we were approaching			1
' ' worst experiences ever ' : the @entity76 comes into land at the airport as the @entity73 taxis across the runway ' go - around ' : the @entity12 pilot is forced to abort the landing , pulling up and going around the other plane ' the weather was fine , so after the @entity53 plane reached the runway and got onto it , we went onto a second round , not waiting for the air traffic controller 's command			1
' it took us about 15 minutes to complete the second round			0
when we finished it we approached the airport again and successfully landed at @entity11			0
' as we were taxiing the airport 's controller apologised on the radio for the situation			0
' @entity13 - one of @entity2 's largest airlines , based at @entity99 in @entity100 - praised the captain for his ' composure and professional excellence ' after ' appropriately ' assessing the situation			1
the airline said that the matter was under ' investigation '			0
@entity45 airport authority @entity108 announced a request for the country 's civil aviation safety commission , @entity113 , to examine the near miss and its causes			2
@entity116 , spokesman for the @entity45 air - traffic controller association , @entity118 , said the incident was a ' serious case ' , but said that - despite appearances - there was ' no danger of a collision			1
' @entity125 also insisted that nothing was amiss during the incident			0
a spokesman said : ' @entity125 affirms there was never a situation of risk in the supposed incident registered on saturday at @entity11 between a @entity2 @entity13 plane and an @entity125 plane			1
' a spokesman for the @entity45 airports authority @entity108 stated the @entity13 landing could have taken place without any risk as both planes were in the places they should have been with sufficient distance between each other			2
' safe landing : the @entity12 767 from @entity2 airline @entity13 lands after the near - miss at @entity11 airport as the @entity12 approached the runway , the @entity73 had already taxied clear of the location on the way to its own runway for takeoff , he said			1
the heart - stopping incident , which occurred on saturday , was caught on camera by @entity157 , who posted the video to @entity159 , where it has already been viewed more than one million times			0
mr @entity157 , who has posted hundreds of plane videos online , said seeing the near - miss was ' one of the worst experiences i have ever had '			1
he said : ' an @entity166 ( @entity167 ) incoming from @entity168 as @entity169 and @entity125 @entity73 ( @entity170 ) were involved into what could be the bigger disaster of @entity11			2
' the @entity13 767 was about to land on @entity173 while the @entity174 was crossing the runway			2
' by the time @entity2 pilots sight @entity125 ( they were taxiing to holding point of @entity179 for take - off ) on runway while they were on final approach , they did their best making an impressive and close go around			2
' after that incidence the plane landed safely on runway 02 , and the @entity125 took - off heading @entity186			0
