@entity42 and @entity43 came up with the idea after @entity42 's cataracts prevented her from reading the display on her mobile phone			0
the pair developed the device to make phones display a large letter that relates to frequent callers			2
for example , if someone called @entity56 calls , a large v will appear			2
letters can be customised for different calls			2
this means that the child can only call the 12 pre-assigned numbers			1
and only the parents can add or change this list of contacts			0
makers @entity3 believe that the basic functionality of the @entity4 reduces the risks of text or cyber bulling , finding inappropriate material online , ' sexting ' or being mugged			2

children can customise the handset with different colours and patterns including ' @entity103 ' , ' @entity21 ' or ' @entity104 '			0
in addition to the 12 names , parents can also choose to have a 999 button programmed which has to be pressed three times to activate			2
makers ownfone claim it can be used on a daily basis , or charged and kept only for emergencies			0
it adds that if the phone is charged and then stored away , it will hold that charge for up to a year later			0
@entity116 , founder of @entity26 , said : ' in a world dominated by smartphones parents face a difficult choice when it comes to finding a first phone for their child			0
' we wanted to design a fun product that appeals to children but puts parents in complete control and minimizes usage while still providing a vital connection between parent and child			0
' the @entity4 costs from £ 55 and is available through the @entity26 website			1
the site also says that the @entity4 is ideal for seniors , as well as a work phone , because its been designed to be hard - wearing			1
