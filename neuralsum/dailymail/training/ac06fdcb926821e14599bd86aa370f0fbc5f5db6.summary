as @entity3 international @entity2 smashed a six over the square leg boundary at the @entity6 ' @entity5 , veteran broadcaster @entity1 's first thought appeared to be right			1
@entity1 mused immediately that the left - hander 's destructive flick off his legs was bound for his car and soon enough , with an almighty thud , the dent was there for all to see on his roof			1
' that 's out of the ground , that 's gone , it 's downtown , ' @entity1 said as the delivery from @entity21 ' @entity20 - no mug with five tests to his name - disappeared over a hot dog stand			2
the significant dent on the roof of a car that @entity1 was convinced was hit as soon as the ball left the bat @entity31 broadcaster @entity1 laughs as he commentates on @entity2 hitting his car with a six ' it 's on my car ! it is ! i think it hit my car ! oh , the downside of getting a park so close ! ' the upside for @entity1 was that the car was a rental , @entity1 revealed when asked by unsympathetic co-commentator @entity42 if he was insured			1
' for @entity44 's sake , @entity2 , ' @entity1 said , taking the hit in good humour			1
it 's not the first one , i suppose			0
usually it 's a scrape on the door ... how am i going to explain that ? at least i have evidence			0
' after a lengthy wait to find the ball , or a replacement , there was hope from @entity1 as he had second thoughts about whose car it was			2
' i do n't think i was that far down , ' @entity1 said			2
' for some reason i was more behind the hotdog stand 30 yards back			0
' @entity6 opener @entity2 whipped his shot way over the square leg boundary and into a car @entity2 appears non-plussed by the six , one of four in his blistering innings of 56 from 25 balls either way , @entity2 's six was among few highlights for the @entity6 side in their clash with @entity21 in the @entity3 @entity76			1
the big - hitting opener top - scored with 56 from 25 balls , hitting four sixes and six fours as the @entity6 reached 169 for 7 off their 20 overs			0
the @entity21 chased it down with two balls to spare			0
in the same match a fan took a spectacular catch in the crowd , sliding barefoot down a grass hill for a one - handed grab off @entity6 batsman @entity89			1
as it turned out , the man who took the catch , @entity90 , was the partner of @entity89 's sister who was also in the crowd .			0

@entity6 batsman @entity2 hit @entity1 's car with a six
commentator speculated straight away that it was his parked *vehilce*
@entity2 's *heroics* were n't enough for a @entity103 *victory* over @entity104
in the same match a spectator took a spectacular sliding catch
