a @entity1 man has opened up about a very special friendship between him and his best mate - a crocodile called ' @entity5 '			1
@entity6 , 74 , who previously owned and ran @entity7 and zoo in far - north @entity1 first came across the 5.2 metre croc in 1989			1
for 20 years the farmer would sit on the enormous creature 's back while he chatted to him , and never once felt as though he was in danger			2
@entity14 had already been trying to capture @entity5 , who had apparently been killing cattle in @entity16 near @entity17 , 70 kilometres south of @entity18 for years , when they asked for mr @entity6 's help			1
@entity6 and @entity5 the crocodile shared a strong bond during their 20 year long friendship ' he was on the run for a couple of years , he had been a naughty boy and was taking cows , ' mr @entity6 told @entity27			1
' the cattle used to come down there and have a drink and @entity5 used to grab them by the nose and drown them , ' he said			2
mr @entity6 then spent the next six months setting up traps for the huge creature , in a last bid to save him after a warrant had been issued to kill the croc			2
' they had a trap for a couple of years but he just did n't go in , and after a certain amount of time , you know , there 's a limit to the amount of time you can spend on this , ' he said			0
' they ( @entity52 ) issued a warrant to the farmer to shoot him			0
' the farmer who owned the property where @entity5 was snatching cattle called in the help of mr @entity6 and , helped by some ' freak weather ' , they were finally able catch the reptile			1
a heavy rainfall meant the trap which had been set up had moved and turtles had gone in after the bait , which @entity5 then followed			0
@entity5 was captured my mr @entity6 in 1989 after he was found stealing a local farmer 's cattle ' three weeks later , water was down to about ankle - deep and i looked hard in the murky water and i said there 's this great big massive animal in there , ' mr @entity6 revealed			1
' i said i 've done the most horrible thing of my life , i 've killed this big animal			0
' however upon closer inspection it appeared @entity5 was alive and well , and had been keeping himself alive by coming up for air every few hours			0
' because of his size he was able to push the trap up to get a breath of air and then go back down for three to four hours , ' the croc farmer said			0
after a huge operation which involved 16 men carrying @entity5 onto the back of a truck and taking him back to mr @entity6 's farm , the creature was finally settled into what would be his home for the next two decades			1
the farmer describes the reptile that was his best friend as a ' funny animal ' , and said @entity5 and him shared a special bond			0
he was named after @entity99 , the farmer whose cattle he was stealing			0
' that gives me a memory of where i caught him from , ' mr @entity6 said			2
the 5.2 metre croc and his farmer would spend time together every day , and mr @entity6 said he was never frightened or felt he was in danger ' @entity107 brings friends over to have a look at the crocodile named after him			1
' the crocodile would come when mr @entity6 called him , rushing up out of the water to greet his mate			2
the farmer would then spend time perched on @entity5 's back , chatting to him about what was happening on the farm			1
' every day i was there i always spent time with him , i always sat on him , ' mr @entity6 said			2
these meetings would take place between ten and 20 times a day , often in front of the tourists who came to visit the farm but sometimes just between the two of them			0
' sometimes depending if i had time i would go and sit on him and just hang out and chat to him '			0
when asked whether what he was doing was dangerous , mr @entity6 disagreed saying he never felt unsafe with @entity5			1
' no , if i felt danger i would n't be in there			0
' i love animals but i love living too , ' he joked			0
since mr @entity6 had to give up the farm in 2008 after repeated knee problems left him with less mobility than he was used to , the farmer has been back to visit @entity5 only once			1
mr @entity6 previously owned and ran @entity7 and zoo in far - north @entity1 ' i went down after 18 months and went down to @entity5 's cage and he was in the water , ' he revealed			1
' i called him over to the gate and he came over to me and the look on his face was just like " @entity6 why did you leave me here ? " ' ' they would n't let me go inside and i can see their point because it 's not mine any more , i understand , ' mr @entity6 said			2
' he was a really lovely animal , the only reason i sold out was that i got an infection on my knee			0
' but mr @entity6 does n't think he can go back to see @entity5 again , who he believes has been moved to another farm			1
' i ca n't go there again , ' he said			0
mr @entity6 instead prefers to remember @entity5 as he knew him , happily sitting with his farmer and best friend sitting on his back , having a chat .			1
