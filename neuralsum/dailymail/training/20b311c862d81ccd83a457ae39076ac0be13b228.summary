with battery life consistently voted as the most important feature when upgrading a phone , handsets , chip makers and networks are working on ways to squeeze as much energy out of them as possible			1
and now @entity9 believes it has made a significant breakthrough – boosting battery life by up to 49 per cent			1
the @entity12 - based firm saw the results during its first live trial of a software known as @entity16 on a 3g network			1
@entity9 has completed its first live testing of @entity16 technology			1
when using apps , phones send and receive small amounts of data , and @entity9 's technology is designed to handle these so - called ' data packets ' more efficiently			1
this increases browsing speeds , power savings and response times when running applications such as @entity32 , @entity33 , and @entity34 , as well as browsing the web , sending emails and using services such as @entity38 , phones often send and receive small amounts of data , known as packets , of just a few hundreds of bytes or a few kbytes			1
@entity16 is designed to handle these small data packets more efficiently than other software			1
the software is designed to help operators handle data sent over @entity47			2
when running applications such as @entity32 , @entity33 , and @entity34 , as well as browsing the web , sending emails and using services such as @entity38 , phones often send and receive small amounts of data			1
these are known as packets , and are typically just a few hundreds of bytes or a few kbytes			0
@entity16 is designed to handle these small data packets more efficiently than other software			1
this makes apps run faster , and also means they use less energy over the course of a day , for example			0
the technology also means operators can boost the speed and quality of their services , and support a higher number of phones on their networks			2
more technical details can be found on @entity9 's original white paper			0
this makes apps run faster , and also means they use less energy over the course of a day , for example			0
the technology additionally means operators can boost the speed and quality of their services , and support a higher number of phones on their networks			0
according to the recent @entity9 tests , the @entity78 software boosts speeds and network response times by up to 65 per cent , and leads to up to 20 per cent faster browsing			1
users also saw power savings of up to 49 per cent , which meant their battery life lasted almost twice as long - depending on which applications were being used			1
the lowest power saving was nine per cent			0
the tests were run on the commercial 3g/hspa network of a major @entity92 operator - although @entity9 did not reveal which operator it was			0
testers also used devices fitted with @entity97 processors that already support @entity16			2
@entity98 has contacted both companies for more specific information			0
‘ smartphones already outsell feature phones and by 2018 , smartphone penetration in some developed markets is expected to exceed 90 per cent , ’ said @entity101 , vice president , mobile broadband portfolio management at @entity9			2
the tests were run on a commercial 3g/hspa network using devices fitted with @entity97 processors			2
results revealed 50 % power savings , when certain apps were used , 65 % faster response times , and 21 % faster browsing			1
@entity114 relates to networks sending signals to a web - enabled device ‘ with virtually all these smartphones being 3g - enabled , it 's important to be able to improve network efficiency			0
’ @entity16 is a capability that @entity122 already supports on its latest snapdragon processors			0
these processors are seen in high - end , flagship phones including the @entity125 6 , @entity126 and note 4 , and @entity127 8.9 ( 2014 )			0
@entity9 said the live network tests ‘ produced substantial performance gains that exceeded @entity97 's expectations ’ , including beating previous laboratory test results			2
but it is not known when it will be widely available to networks and customers .			0
