in the wake of @entity3 ’s cut - price £ 16million move to @entity5 , @entity0 just could not get his head around the logic of @entity9 ’s decision to offload the @entity11 striker			1
‘ how have @entity5 got him for £ 16m ? ’ wondered his former team - mate			2
‘ i ca n’t work it out			0
i am struggling to work out the logic , i ca n’t understand it			2
it ’s odd in two or three ways			0
’ nearly three months on , we ’re still searching for answers			0
@entity3 sealed a £ 16million move from @entity9 to @entity5 on transfer deadline day @entity3 scored his first @entity5 hat - trick during their 4 - 1 against @entity25 in october @entity3 ( left ) scores his first @entity5 goal , away at @entity27 in september @entity28 attempted to justify the deadline - day sale by comparing the records of @entity31 and @entity32 to the academy graduate , the boyhood fan who had trained with @entity35 as an 12 - year - old and seemed set for a career - long stay at @entity38			1
the @entity40 , of course , had a point ; @entity3 ’s 10 goals in two years a meagre return compared to the 38 of @entity44 and 29 of @entity31			1
but history is just that , history			0
@entity3 , at the @entity46 and with @entity11 , has set about writing a new chapter in new surrounds			1
already this season he has 10 goals for club and country – @entity31 has nine , @entity44 , five			1
@entity52 – the man signed to replace @entity3 – has one solitary strike			2
an 12 - year - old @entity3 ( right ) trains with @entity9 legend @entity35 in 2003 @entity0 ( right ) does n't believe @entity54 should have allowed @entity3 to leave @entity3 has scored 10 goals for club and country since completing his @entity5 move in the summer but @entity3 is about more than goals , shown by his performance during @entity11 ’s 3 - 1 win over @entity60 on tuesday			1
there he was about graft as well as craft , an indefatigable presence with a willingness to work and worry the opposition backline			0
this weekend it is his former employers who should sound caution			0
on saturday tea - time @entity3 has the chance to heap yet more misery on the man who let him go			1
the 23 - year - old comes up against a defence – in the loosest sense – who have shipped 13 goals on the road this season			0
@entity52 has scored just one @entity81 goal since joining the @entity38 club @entity3 decided to cut his @entity9 career short after a lack of opportunities at centre forward @entity3 ( right ) often found himself on the bench at @entity38 or was told to play on the wing @entity3 , better than anyone , will know their weaknesses			1
but even without insider know - how , @entity9 ’s shortcomings are no secret			2
they are limping by , somehow trailing the @entity96 by just one point and one place ahead of their showdown in north @entity101			0
in their last four they have scraped late points against @entity104 and @entity105 , gone down to defeat in the derby at their city rivals and recorded an unconvincing – but much - needed – 1 - 0 victory over @entity111			0
and @entity3 , of course , has a point to prove			2
he had never agitated for a move away from @entity9			2
on the contrary , he kept his silence amid prolonged deployment in an unfavoured wide role			0
the 23 - year - old adds an impressive work rate to @entity5 's starting line - up @entity28 has a number of injury worries ahead of @entity9 's visit to @entity5 on saturday @entity125 tried to justify @entity3 's sale by comparing the records of @entity31 and @entity32 from that domain they deemed his record not comparable to those populating the penalty area – what did they expect ? now , at @entity5 , he is taking centre stage			1
and so it is that observers such as @entity0 continue to be baffled by @entity9 ’s decision to let @entity3 go – to a top - four rival , no less - without ever knowing how good he could have been			1
on saturday , they might just find out .			0
