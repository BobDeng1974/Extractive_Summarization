a series of earthquakes that rattled a small @entity3 community have been linked to nearby oil and gas operations			0
in 84 days from november 2013 to january 2014 , the area around @entity6 , @entity3 , shook with 27 magnitude two or greater earthquakes			1
now scientists believe these earthquakes were the result of high - pressure injection of drilling wastewater into the ground			1

in this image red squares are injector locations ; pink arrows , approximate location of two large brine production wells that are located both near the faults and near reported earthquakes swarms the oil and gas industry uses injection wells to get rid of wastewater , which can have chemicals , heavy metals , salt and radioactive material			1
the scientists determined this based on where and when the earthquakes happened ; computer models that track pressure changes ; and company data from nearby wells			1
@entity42 , a @entity43 geophysicist , said the timing and location of the quakes correlates better to the drilling and injection than any other possible reason			2
' there appears to be little doubt about the conclusion that the earthquakes were in fact induced , ' @entity51 seismologist @entity50 , who was n't part of the study team , said in an email			0
' there 's almost an abundance of smoking guns in this case			0
' this adds to other studies that linked injecting wastewater from energy wells to a tremendous jump in earthquakes in @entity70 and southern @entity71			1
the map shows inferred faults ( dashed ) at the top of the @entity76 formation , injection wells ( red squares ) , two production wells ( @entity80 and 36734139 ) with significant brine production near the faults ( pink arrows ) and earthquake epicentres ( coloured circles ) recorded by the temporary seismic network ( triangles ) in these areas , there have been more than 950 magnitude 2 or higher quakes so far this year , according to the @entity51			1
earlier today , the @entity92 said it is ' very likely ' that most of the earthquakes that have shaken the state in recent years have been triggered by the subsurface injection of wastewater from oil and natural gas drilling operations			1
the society released a statement following an investigation into dozens of earthquakes recorded in central and north - central @entity70			0
the fluid pressure in the pores and fractures of the rocks is called the ' pore pressure			1
' the pore pressure acts against the weight of the rock and the forces holding the rock together			1
if the pore pressures are low - especially compared to the forces holding the rock together - then only the imbalance of natural in situ earth stresses will cause an occasional earthquake			1
if , however , pore pressures increase , then it would take less of an imbalance of in situ stresses to cause an earthquake			2
this type of failure is called shear failure			0
injecting fluids into the subsurface is one way of increasing the pore pressure and causing faults and fractures to ' fail ' more easily			1
earthquakes can be caused by injecting fluid into the subsurface or by extracting fluids at a rate that causes subsidence and slippage along planes of weakness in the @entity143			2
source : @entity146 @entity145 unlike other research that linked quakes to the injection of wastewater , the @entity43 study also sees a secondary link in another part of the drilling process			1
massive amounts of brine taken out of the ground with the gas , said study co-author @entity159 of the @entity51			2
removing the saltwater changes the underground pressure			2
but the deep injection of the wastes still is the principle culprit , @entity159 said			0
@entity6 sits atop the large underground @entity166 natural gas formation			1
the findings come amid heightened debate over oil and gas regulations , including efforts in some communities to ban drilling			0

this infograpic shows the natural and man - made stress changes that may trigger earthquakes in @entity6 in @entity3 , lawmakers are considering bills that would limit cities ' abilities to do so			2
' cities across the state should be very , very worried , ' @entity192 , an organiser based in @entity194 for the environmental group @entity195 , said in a statement			0
' it is only @entity3 state regulators and lawmakers who are living in denial			0
' the @entity203 , the state 's oil and gas regulator , hired its first seismologist last year to investigate potential links between quakes and fracking after @entity6 residents asked the agency to halt oil and gas activities			1
the seismologist has not offered any conclusions			0
@entity214 , an @entity43 geophysics graduate student , runs a cable to connect the seismometer to communications interface equipment housed in the orange metal box in @entity219 , @entity3			0
the interface equipment allows the transmission of the data collected by the seismometer back to @entity43 @entity6 is a city located in @entity225 in @entity3			2
it sits atop the large @entity228 natural gas formation			0

@entity6 has recently been shaken by 27 quakes with magnitude two or greater
scientists say this is the result of injecting wastewater into the ground
this increases pore pressure in the rock causing faults to ' fail ' more easily
