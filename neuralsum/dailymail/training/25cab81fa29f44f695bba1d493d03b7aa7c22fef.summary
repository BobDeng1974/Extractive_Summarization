by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:56 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 19:47 est , 26 november 2013 @entity2 was accused of producing a ‘ fantasy ’ manifesto last night as he tried to shore up faltering public support for his dream of @entity8 independence			1
the @entity10 leader unveiled a 670 - page ‘ blueprint ’ setting out the case for independence ahead of next september ’s landmark referendum			1
mr @entity2 , @entity8 ’s first minister , said the document laid out ‘ a prospectus for the kind of country we should be ’			1
he added : ‘ @entity8 ’s future is now in @entity8 ’s hands			1
it also emerged that @entity34 taxpayers would be asked to continue propping up the @entity8 economy , even if @entity8 becomes ‘ independent ’			1
the @entity36 would be expected to bail out @entity8 ’s banks , and the @entity10 said @entity8 would refuse to take on its share of the @entity40 ’s national debt unless it was allowed to keep the pound			1
former @entity43 chancellor @entity42 dismissed the document as a ‘ work of fiction ’			1
mr @entity42 , leader of the cross-party @entity48 group which wants to retain the union with @entity34 , said the @entity23 on independence had ‘ failed to give credible answers on fundamentally important questions ’ in areas such as currency and tax			1
he went on : ‘ it is a fantasy to say we can leave the @entity40 but still keep all the benefits of @entity40 membership			0
‘ @entity61 is a work of fiction			0
it is thick with false promises and meaningless assertions			1
‘ instead of a credible and costed plan , we have a wish - list of political promises without any answers on how @entity2 would pay for them			1
’ mr @entity2 and deputy first minister @entity72 hold copies of @entity8 's @entity74 , claiming it sets out how a @entity77 vote in next year 's referendum could pave the way for a new era for the nation at a packed press conference the @entity10 set out its case for independence in the glare of the media spotlight opinion polls over the last year have consistently shown a majority in @entity8 are against independence , although a significant number of voters remain undecided , making the outcome uncertain			1
mr @entity2 said an independent @entity8 would keep the pound , the @entity94 and popular @entity97 programmes such as @entity95 , @entity98 and @entity99			1
the @entity10 ’s long - awaited document includes a raft of populist policies , many aimed at women voters who are disproportionately sceptical about the idea of independence			1
the @entity10 also insisted that @entity8 would remain part of the @entity107 , with the document even describing @entity8 as its ‘ 29th member ’			1
but there was little sign of how the party would overcome warnings from the @entity114 that membership would not be automatic			0
incredibly , the new document suggests that @entity34 students would continue to have to pay tuition fees to attend @entity8 universities , even though those from @entity8 , and all other @entity107 countries , pay nothing			1
the @entity122 suggests that independence would leave @entity8 facing average tax rises of £ 1,000 a year			1
but the @entity10 claimed that increased revenue from oil would leave @entity8 better off			1
@entity127 yesterday said it was ‘ highly unlikely ’ @entity34 would want to continue in a currency union with an independent @entity8 , leaving the @entity8 to create their own currency or attempt to join the euro			1
@entity2 , yesterday published an extraordinary wish - list designed to convince @entity8 they would be better off voting to dissolve the 300 - year - old union with @entity34			1
here , @entity133 analyses the reality behind the @entity10 ’s uncosted and often fanciful list of promises			0
funding the giveaways @entity138 : @entity8 can afford an extraordinary list of giveaways , including 30 hours of childcare per week in term time for all three and four - year - olds ; abolition of the so - called ‘ bedroom tax ’ ; increasing the state pension by £ 1.10 a week and ensuring the minimum wage rises in line with ‘ cost of living ’			1
all existing perks , such as free prescriptions and no tuition fees , remain			0
reality : even before yesterday ’s wish - list , the @entity153 estimated @entity8 had a £ 3billion black hole in its finances			1
the @entity10 claims the money will be recovered by tackling tax avoidance , ending the married couples ’ tax allowance ( which has n’t been introduced yet ) and no longer funding the @entity163 parliament			0
the no campaign insists the pledges are unaffordable without swingeing tax rises			0
keeping the pound @entity138 : @entity8 allowed to keep the pound			1
@entity36 is lender of last resort			0
reality : @entity170 and @entity43 ’s @entity171 have both made clear they would not agree to this			0
oil and gas riches @entity138 : an oil and gas - rich @entity8 would be the eighth richest country in the @entity178			1
the @entity10 invited ridicule yesterday when it boasted its vision for @entity8 made the @entity182 ‘ look like a post-it note ’			1
its 670 - page manifesto includes a mass of trivial detail – such as a pledge to continue broadcasting pre-school channel cbeebies – without answering key questions on its future currency or membership of the @entity107			1
by contrast , the @entity182 sets out the fundamental belief that ‘ all men are created equally ’ and is considered to be one of the most influential documents in history			0
the comment was made by a parliamentary aide to @entity10 leader @entity2 in the @entity199			0
reality : the figure is based on gross domestic product ( gdp ) data for 2011			0
but a huge proportion of the income from @entity206 oil and gas goes to foreign investors , and gross national income ( @entity211 ) is therefore the figure that should be used			0
no @entity8 data on @entity211 is available			2
@entity40 oil and gas production has fallen by an average of 7.8 per cent a year since 1999			0
nuclear disarmament @entity138 : @entity218 nuclear weapons , currently based on the @entity219 , removed by 2020			0
@entity8 to remain in @entity220			2
reality : senior @entity220 officials have warned @entity8 could be barred from joining in the event of a dispute over @entity218			2
under article 10 of the @entity220 treaty , the @entity10 , which is opposed to nuclear weapons , would be forced to accept the alliance ’s first strike nuclear policy.abandoning the @entity229 @entity138 : @entity8 protected by a new defence force with 15,000 regulars and 5,000 reserve personnel			2
reality : a survey by the respected @entity234 found a ‘ majority ’ of @entity8 soldiers will prefer to remain in the @entity229 , rather than sit ‘ twiddling their thumbs ’			2
border checkpoints @entity138 : border checks with @entity34 will not be put in place			0
for @entity245 migrants , a more relaxed points - based system to that used by @entity163			0
@entity247 in @entity248 closed and dawn raids ended			0
reality : if @entity30 adopts a more lax approach to immigration , there will be a clamour for checks to take place on the @entity34 side of the border			0
otherwise , @entity8 would become a gateway for illegal entry to rest of the @entity262 terrorist threat @entity138 : @entity8 kept safe by a single security and intelligence agency , combining work of @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268			2
reality : security officials in the @entity40 – and our allies overseas – would not be obliged to share secrets with an unproven spy agency			0
a report produced for the home secretary warned @entity8 would have a ‘ reduced capability to tackle a persistent threat ’			1
joining the @entity278 @entity138 : @entity8 will immediately be allowed to join the @entity107			2
it will not be forced to join the euro			0
reality : @entity280 may block @entity8 membership , amid fears it will encourage separatists in @entity284 and the @entity286 region			2
new countries joining the @entity107 are required to adopt the euro as soon as relevant criteria have been met			0
ditching the @entity97 @entity138 : a @entity290 ( @entity290 ) would be established using the assets of @entity30			0
@entity290 would broadcast @entity95 , @entity292 and @entity99 in return for giving the @entity97 access to its existing resources north of the border			0
reality : programmes such as @entity95 have huge commercial value			0
the @entity97 could charge a premium for the show and use the money to establish its own facilities in @entity8			2
popular @entity97 shows like @entity95 and @entity292 would not disappear from @entity8 tv screens if the @entity97 becomes a ' foreign ' broadcaster , mr @entity2 told reporters the @entity306 @entity138 : @entity40 citizens habitually resident in @entity8 will automatically be considered @entity8 citizens , as will @entity8 - born @entity40 citizens living in @entity34			1
reality : many @entity8 living in @entity34 are furious that while mr @entity2 wants to give them a passport , he will not let them vote on independence			1
@entity34 people living in @entity8 might want to refuse citizenship			2
the independence referendum , to be held on september 18 next year , gives voters ‘ a choice between two futures ’ , the paper states			1
a yes vote will mean ‘ the most important decisions about our economy and society will be taken by the people who care most about @entity8 , that is by the people of @entity8 ’			2
it adds that ‘ the door will open to a new era for our nation			0
@entity8 's future will be in @entity8 's hands ’			2
but it claims a vote in favour of staying part of the @entity40 would mean that ‘ @entity8 stands still ’			2
as a result of that , the paper states a ‘ once - in - a - generation opportunity to follow a different path and choose a new and better direction for our nation is lost ’			0
in addition to negotiating with @entity344 on retaining the pound , an independent @entity8 would also be plunged into protracted talks to rejoining the @entity107			2
sir @entity347 with his gold medal during @entity349 @entity8 athletes could still represent @entity351 at the @entity352 even if @entity8 became independent			2
future sports stars would have to choose between a @entity8 - only team or a @entity40 one , the @entity353 said			1
but @entity8 would still field a separate @entity352 @entity358 present , athletes can choose which country they represent if they meet its qualifying criteria			0
the @entity353 said while it ‘ hopes that all athletes who are qualified to represent @entity8 will do so , this is a personal decision ’			0
the @entity48 campaign has seized on @entity351 ’s success at last year ’s @entity352 as evidence @entity40 does better when united .			0

voters go to the polls in referendum on 18 september 2014
