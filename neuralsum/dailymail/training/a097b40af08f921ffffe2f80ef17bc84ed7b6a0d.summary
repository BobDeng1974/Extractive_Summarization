doting mum @entity0 will give her little girl the best present of all - the gift of life			1
the 25 - year - old 's newborn daughter @entity5 was diagnosed with a liver disease , which only affects one in every 16,000 children , when she was just weeks old			1
and after undergoing a life - saving operation she may one day still need a liver transplant - which the primary school teacher , from @entity11 , is ready to give her			2
doting mum @entity0 has vowed that if her daughter @entity5 , who suffers from a rare liver condition biliary atresia which causes inflammation of the bile ducts and liver , needs a liver transplant she will donate hers the condition affects only one in 16,000 children and @entity5 has already spent stretches of her life in hospital at just seven weeks old @entity5 was diagnosed with biliary atresia , a rare condition in which the bile ducts in the liver become progressively blocked which leads to irreversible liver damage			1
and the prognosis is still uncertain , with medics saying there is an 85 per cent chance that @entity5 will need a liver transplant in the next two years			2
today , just a month after her operation , her mum @entity0 is hoping her own liver will be enough to save @entity5 if she needs it			1
the primary school teacher , from @entity11 , said : ' i would do anything for her and i would give her my liver if i could			0
' @entity5 was born weighing just over 5lb and @entity0 and her partner @entity42 , 26 , noticed that her skin was jaundiced			2
following several appointments with @entity46 , hospital medics made the diagnosis			0
@entity5 , who was only 5lb at birth , was diagnosed with the disease at just seven weeks old @entity0 and her partner @entity50 cradle their daughter @entity5 who suffers from a rare liver disease @entity0 said : ' i did n't have a clue what it was then they started talking about the liver and i just broke down			1
' no words could describe how i felt			0
we were both hoping it was something different			0
i just kept telling myself that everything was going to be ok			0
' in a harrowing moment parents @entity0 and @entity50 kissed their daughter goodbye as they handed her over to surgeons to complete the operation			2
@entity67 describe bilary atresia , which effects one in every 16,000 children , as : ' a condition in which inflammation develops within the bile ducts around the time of birth			1
' the inflammation can occur in any of the bile ducts both inside and outside the liver			0
this leads to bile duct damage , reducing the flow of bile , which causes scarring of the liver			1
' the bile ducts carry bile , which is needed to digest fat in the diet , to the gut			0
symptoms include pale stools , yellowed skin and potentially frequent nosebleeds			0
those who suffer from bilary atresia will generally undergo the @entity94 procedure'where the bile is drained from the liver into the gut			2
the reasons for the disease are unknown and even after the @entity94 procedure is complete there is still a large risk of further issues such as bloody stools , itching and in some cases failure to thrive			0
' it was awful , ' said @entity0 , ' we had to take her down to theatre and then we gave her a kiss goodbye			0
she 's our little miracle			0
' @entity5 , who is now 11 - weeks - old , is doing well after the surgery to clear the build - up of bile from her liver and medics are pleased with her progress			1
the family are expected to be told if @entity5 needs a liver transplant in the near future			2
meanwhile , @entity0 hopes that little @entity5 's story will raise awareness of the disease			1
doting @entity50 sat with his daughter @entity5 at the hospital after it was discovered that she has biliary atresia			1

@entity0 has *promised* to donate part of her liver to her daughter
11 - week - old @entity5 is suffering from the bile duct disease biliary atresia
the rare condition affects just one in every 16,000 children
