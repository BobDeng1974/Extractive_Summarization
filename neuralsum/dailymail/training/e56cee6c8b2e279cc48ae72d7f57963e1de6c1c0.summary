by @entity0 published : 20:21 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 20:31 est , 12 february 2013 @entity1 and his wife @entity1 were the second - largest philanthropists in the country last year as they gave away nearly half a billion dollars			1
the @entity5 founder and his pediatrician wife donated a total of $ 498.8million to charitable causes in 2012 , putting them in line after billionaire @entity11			1
mr @entity12 gave more than six - times more than his younger counterparts , giving away $ 3.1billion to various causes , but it was the rapid ascent of the @entity16 in the ranks of the country 's philanthropists that comes as more of a surprise			1
power couple : @entity1 and his wife @entity1 were listed as the second - largest donors in the country in 2012 after giving away $ 498.8million mr @entity1 , 28 , made his first massive donation two years earlier when he announced that he was pledging $ 100million to the @entity26 school system in @entity27			1
low key : the couple are notoriously private but mr @entity1 has been public with his donations in the past that donation was tainted with cynicism as it came around the same time as the film @entity34 which portrayed him in a somewhat negative light			0
the spending spree did n't stop there , however , as @entity39 reported that he donated 18 million shares of @entity5 stock to the @entity43 in 2012			1
the shares are valued at about $ 498.8million and he directed it towards the local group			1
education and health programs are two of the many ways that the non-profit directs their funds			0
' together , we will look for areas in education and health to focus on next			0
i 'm hopeful we 'll be able to have as positive an impact in our next set of projects , ' mr @entity1 posted on his @entity5 page at the time of his december donation			1
aside from the donation to the @entity26 education system and the latest boost to the @entity69 fund , mr @entity1 has used tools other than his deep pockets			0
in may of last year , mr @entity1 said announced that he integrated a way for @entity5 users to publicize their role as organ donors in an effort to connect those in need with people willing to help			1
this was one of the clearest ways that his wife 's interests influenced his charitable efforts			2
first big donation : mr @entity1 gave $ 100million to the @entity26 school system in 2010 and announced the move on @entity90 's talk show alongside @entity27 governor @entity91 and @entity26 mayor @entity92 other ways to help : @entity1 also used @entity5 as a way to do charitable work as he incorporated an organ donation function into the social networking site in may 2012 as his then - girlfriend was studying pediatrics - and just months after it was revealed that @entity101 founder @entity100 underwent a liver transplant before he died - mr @entity1 told how he felt the social network could help			1
' she 's in medical school now so our dinner conversations - she 's going to be a pediatrian - are often about @entity5 and kids and the kids that she 's meeting			1
she has these stories about she spends a lot of time with the patients she 's treating she 'll spend weeks with someone and getting to know them and see them getting sicker as they do n't have the organ that they need , ' he told @entity120 's @entity119			0
other couples : hedge funder @entity122 and his wife @entity123 were listed third ( left ) as @entity125 co-founder @entity124 and his wife @entity126 came in fifth place ( right ) ' she comes home and her face is all lit up because someone 's life is going to be better because of this			2
' the @entity133 are not alone as the only wealthy donors to come from the world of technology , as they are joined in the top five by @entity138 co-founder @entity137 and @entity125 co-founder @entity124 and his wife @entity126			2
