by @entity0 published : 20:12 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 10:19 est , 15 march 2013 those who watched the @entity2 embellish his credentials as the defender of the countryside in a special edition of @entity7 on @entity8 at the weekend will have been impressed by his love of all things rural			1
they will have noted his fervour as he spoke of the importance of protecting the countryside for future generations			1
but his words sounded rather hollow this week to some country folk living near the @entity2 ’s experimental new town of @entity18 in the most beautiful part of @entity20			1
hard - y words : the royal proposal to build on the field near author @entity25 's home , owned by the @entity2 , pictured yesterday during his visit to @entity27 , has outraged @entity29 creator @entity28 for royal aides are evaluating the prospect of building another small town on a vast cornfield			1
however , this is n’t just any old cornfield			1
it is the one that forms a spectacular valley at the centre of @entity25 country and is overlooked by the author ’s former home , @entity43 , now owned by the @entity44			1
it is also the very same field @entity25 describes in lyrical detail in many of his novels			1
the proposal has outraged @entity29 creator lord @entity28 , who lives nearby and is president of the @entity52			1
he tells me : ‘ i am absolutely sure that the @entity2 , of all people , would be horrified			1
‘ the prince loves the countryside like nobody else			1
everyone has been jumping up and down about this locally			1
it ’s the most beautiful swooping cornfield , which goes down into a dip and then up to a wood on the far side			1
i just do n’t believe @entity64 has been made aware of any of this			1
’ royal build : the suggested village to be build on the field in ' @entity25 country ' will be similar to nearby @entity18 , designed by the @entity2 the valley is jointly owned by the @entity2 and a local landowner who , i understand , has no wish to see the land developed			1
but @entity64 ’s @entity75 , which owns 66 acres of the 103 - acre site , is about to employ experts to look at the feasibility of building up to 1,000 houses — a proposal bound to provoke fierce local opposition			1
it comes after @entity82 informed the @entity83 it wants to include the area in its draft housing plan			2
‘ the council has put forward a proposal to develop this land and we are undertaking a feasibility assessment , ’ says a @entity83 spokeswoman			2
‘ it is our duty to assist			2
’ that assistance , of course , could potentially earn prince @entity64 around £ 50 million			1
crime writer @entity96 , who lives nearby , says : ‘ they want to stick something half the size of @entity18 in front of @entity43			2
@entity25 ’s house will disappear from view			1
’ surrounded by his family , including daughter @entity105 , 31 , it should have been the jolliest of occasions for @entity108 boss sir @entity107 as they celebrated publication of his remarkable mother @entity111 ’s memoir , @entity114 ’s @entity113			2
but what was on the tycoon ’s mind was the reputation of the @entity119 , someone he considers to be a friend			2
@entity107 had remained silent throughout the furore when @entity124 - winning author @entity123 described @entity119 as a ‘ shop window mannequin ’ with no personality , whose only purpose was to breed			1
white knight : sir @entity107 , pictured with daughter @entity105 and wife @entity129 at monday 's book launch , came to the defence of the @entity119 no bad word : @entity119 is ' well - informed and intelligent ' but when the panel game show presenter and comedienne @entity134 accused the @entity119 of having no opinions , sir @entity0 felt this was the last straw			1
‘ miss @entity134 is so wrong , ’ he tells me			2
‘ i know @entity119 , and this is not the person i know			2
‘ we ’ve been on family holidays together			2
' i can say with conviction that she is well - informed , very intelligent and wonderful company			2
’ speaking at the women - only @entity146 club , sir @entity0 adds : ‘ @entity119 certainly has strong opinions about a whole range of subjects			2
‘ but because she is a member of the @entity150 , she simply can not express these opinions			2
‘ she certainly does n’t deserve this criticism			0
‘ and coming from a comedienne ? please ! ’ @entity155 bosses are despairing over viewing figures for @entity157 relaunched six months ago			0
hosted by @entity159 and @entity160 , it is attracting around 700,000 , less than half the audience of rival @entity162 and way short of the one million target they set			0
but might there be a solution close at hand ? refreshing change : @entity170 's stint on @entity157 brought figures up for what has not been reported is that @entity157 did come close to a million viewers on one day during the february half - term week when @entity170 and @entity174 stood in for @entity159 and @entity160			1
it 's true a strike by some @entity8 staff affected @entity178			1
but it has sparked speculation that mother - of - two @entity119 , who already presents @entity157 on fridays as well as standing in for @entity159 during her holidays , will appear more often			0
the programme has floundered since replacing @entity183 in 2010			0
big money signings @entity185 and @entity186 have come and gone , and at one stage ratings fell as low as 300,000			0
@entity189 , of course , is a veteran of 13 years of breakfast telly , while the excellent @entity174 has been around longer than me			0
it is a debilitating illness that she likens to a hammer blow every 15 minutes to her knees , back , shoulders and hips			0
this is how singer and actress @entity199 describes the ‘ peculiar virus ’ she ’s been suffering for the past three months			0
her symptoms have been so painful that she has had to undergo daily physiotherapy at a sports injury centre			0
but despite her illness , she has just started a nationwide tour of a play , @entity208			0
‘ bizarrely , i know four other people with the same symptoms — they all live locally			0
’ her husband , rocker @entity211 , has also developed the virus			0
she tells fans on her blog : ‘ weight loss is the main concern			0
i ’ve dropped about a stone and lost muscle tone			0
’ happily , she is improving , and adds : ‘ this is mainly due to the fact i went back to work and did n’t stay at home feeling sorry for myself			1
’ actor sir @entity223 , who is 80 tomorrow , tells his @entity225 followers : ‘ thank you for your kind birthday messages			0
will blow the candles off			0
’ fans will recall his famous line from the 1969 comedy film @entity230 : ‘ you were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off ! ’ he 's played some of the great theatrical roles , from @entity236 to @entity237			1
but veteran thespian sir @entity238 admits one opportunity has eluded him — @entity240			0
taking a break from filming @entity155 sitcom @entity243 , in which he plays sir @entity246 ’s boyfriend , @entity238 , 74 , says : ‘ i ’d love to do @entity240			0
@entity246 has been on it and i ’m so jealous			0
‘ they have n’t had anyone playing a professional actor yet , so maybe my character could have a room in @entity254 ’s house while he ’s doing a local gig			0
’ despite president @entity258 ’s plans to impose draconian soak - the - rich taxes , actress @entity256 will not be deserting her beloved @entity260			1
but @entity262 star — in @entity263 yesterday to present a theatre gong at the @entity265 — does retain a residual loyalty			0
‘ i was planning to cheer for @entity260 at the @entity268 game against @entity269 , ’ she says			0
‘ but then i heard @entity270 and i was on my feet			0
@entity272 does it for me			0
