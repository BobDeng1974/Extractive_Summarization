faced with months of roadworks and a 14 - mile diversion around a busy commuter route , most of us would simply resign ourselves to an earlier start to the working day			1
but businessman @entity6 had different ideas			0
after experiencing the upheaval caused by a road closure in @entity10 , he rented a nearby field – and became the first private individual to build a @entity14 toll road in more than a century			2
mr @entity6 spent £ 150,000 building the unofficial road next to the @entity16 , where a small section had been cordoned off after a landslip – leaving thousands with a 14 - mile detour through country lanes			1
now for a payment of £ 2 each way , motorists can avoid driving on the hour - long diversion , and instead travel 400 yards along freshly laid tarmac			2
speaking next to his road in @entity22 , @entity10 , 62 - year - old mr @entity6 said : ‘ i have had a 100 per cent positive response from the public on this			2
too many people are displaced by the road closure			0
‘ their daily lives have been so disrupted			0
i think people are very grateful that we have taken the risk			0
it ’s not easy to build your own toll road , but we got there in the end			2
’ the @entity16 between @entity60 and @entity61 was closed in february after a landslip caused cracks to appear in the road			1
@entity6 's toll road will be open 24 hours a day , seven days a week , with toll operators there all the time businesses in the area soon began to suffer – including the cafe and party supplies shop mr @entity6 runs with his 52 - year - old wife @entity71 in @entity61			1
‘ it used to just be a very quick drive for us to @entity61 , but we were having to do a 14 - mile detour which was taking up to an hour down tiny lanes just not designed to take the traffic , ’ mr @entity6 explained			1
he asked landowner @entity78 for permission to rent the field until @entity81 and hired three workmen to build the road in just ten days			0
his bill came to £ 150,000 , but mr @entity6 believes the road will cost him a further £ 150,000 in upkeep costs , including the salaries of two 24 - hour - a - day toll booth operators			1
however the father of four is confident he will recoup his investment before the council ’s road opens in december			0
the @entity22 toll road has been opened by local businessman @entity6 , 62 , who was fed up of an hour long detour caused by roadworks after just a few hundred yards of highway was cordoned off thanks to a landslip aerial view showing the @entity102 road on the left and the main road on the right			1
the toll road is the first privately owned to open for more than 100 years @entity6 , 62 , built a private toll road in @entity10 after the @entity108 - a popular commuter route - was shut in february following a landslip ‘ we ’ve got to reach £ 300,000 , that works out at 30,000 cars between now and @entity81 just to break even , ’ he said , adding : ‘ if we cover our costs we ’ll be very happy indeed			1
’ mr @entity6 has now applied for retrospective permission for the 22ft - wide road			2
he has also taken out public liability insurance and officers from @entity61 and the @entity119 have inspected the site to make sure it is on stable ground			0
the booth on the toll road ( left ) only opened yesterday but has already managed to annoy the local council ; drivers cam get a discount if they block book ( right ) businessman @entity6 decided to open the thoroughfare - made of a mix of asphalt and chippings local mother of two @entity133 , 28 , said she was delighted with the road , adding : ‘ it was difficult getting kids around			1
if i wanted to take them to a doctor ’s appointment in @entity61 it was a huge diversion			0
' i think what @entity6 and the farmer have done is brilliant			0
it has already helped a lot of people and i can see us using it a lot			0
’ but a council spokesman said : ‘ while we appreciate the difficulties residents have experienced , it ’s not just the planning , it ’s the safety and legal aspect of drivers using the road			2
’ he added : ‘ @entity159 has started to deliver a solution as quickly as possible			0
’ @entity16 closed : drivers can use the toll road at £ 2 a pop or use the @entity31 , which entails a 10 - mile detour local entrepreneur @entity6 spent £ 150,000 of his own money to build the 340 - yard toll road @entity6 , local resident and businessman , and @entity169 at the entrance to the @entity22 toll road			1

the @entity16 @entity108 between @entity61 and @entity60 was shut in february following a landslip and wo *n't* be repaired until the end of the year
local resident @entity6 put up £ 150,000 of his own money to build bypass
the route which opened yesterday is first privately run toll road to be built since cars became a familiar sight more than 100 years ago
the toll road is just 340 yards in *length* but avoids a 10 - mile detour
local council about road *unhappy* *citing* health and safety concerns
