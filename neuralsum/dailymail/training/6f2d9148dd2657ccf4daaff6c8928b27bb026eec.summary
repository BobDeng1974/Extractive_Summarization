rumors that the author of @ @entity40 was not even an employee of the @entity25 giant began months ago and @entity14 has assiduously tried to remove all mentions of his name and images from the @entity46			1
contacted by the @entity34 a few weeks ago , @entity14 , who did admit to working for @entity47 for seven years , was slightly ambiguous about his connection to @entity3			2
' to preempt what you ’re about to say , legally speaking , ' he said , ' i was never explicitly an employee of the firm			0

' this was never about me as a person , ' he said			0
' it was n’t about a firm			0

it was about the culture in general			0
' poking fun : the tweets that @entity88 posted show a keen sense of how out - of - touch bankers can present themselves to the average - @entity91 on @entity92 loud and boorish : the brash reputation of bankers is played up to on the @entity95 feed according to his limited professional profile 's online , @entity96 works as a hedge fund manager for @entity101 , which only has a dozen or so employees and is headquartered in @entity105			1

' he ’s been pretty straight with us the entire time , so this is not a surprise , ' said the book ’s editor , @entity122 , who bought the book without ever meeting mr. @entity14 , according to the @entity34			2
stark realities : the account purely played up to a sense of humor that those involved in huge international finance would share cutting : the humor and parody at the center of the @entity6 feed caused a panic at @entity3 when it was launched in 2011 despite tweeting on fictitious comments overheard in @entity3 ' elevators , @entity88 has a very real agent , who claims that everything in his upcoming book is true			1

headquarters : @entity158 in @entity160 @entity159 ' i thought , ‘ this is ridiculous that people are infatuated with @entity164			0
if they only saw the elitist , sexist and out - of - touch things bankers say			2
’ people had no idea what it is really like			0
' despite still working in finance , @entity14 seems to have a healthy contempt for the more outrageous and out - of - touch comments he has overheard bankers make			1
' even socializing with them — going to bars and having guys buy girls drinks and then throw out a line like , ‘ do n’t worry ladies , these drinks are on @entity3			0
’ he claims he picked on @entity3 due to their fame , but that despite collecting all these stories for year - he does not want to mock his colleagues on @entity25			1
