back in the spotlight : she may be freshly out of rehab , but @entity1 's woes are far from over - with @entity15 , the screenwriter of her new film , @entity12 , labelling her ' mixed up ' , ' scattered ' and ' bossy ' in a candid interview with @entity25 website @entity23 , @entity15 revealed that his time on set with the 27 - year - old was fraught with lateness and nervousness on the actress 's part			1
a former drug user himself , he puts a lot of @entity1 's behaviour down to her @entity37 dependency			2
' she ’s a very mixed up 20 - something , ' he says , adding of their first encounter on set , ' she was late , she was a little scattered , we had nervous small talk , and then she turned it on immediately			2
' hostile co-stars : @entity46 has said that working with @entity1 on @entity12 was like working with ' a child ' - a sentiment echoed by the film 's director , @entity49 ' she was sometimes bossy - i do n’t know if that ’s the @entity37			1
' it was n't all bad , though , with the @entity55 author admitting that he ' genuinely liked her ' and she has real talent			0
' [ @entity1 's ] very knowledgeable about film and composition and lighting and hitting your mark			2
when she did our first table read , she blew me away , ' he raved			0
not all bad : @entity15 - pictured here in 2010 - also said the actress ' blew me away ' , at her initial table read , and that he ' genuinely liked her ' ' i do n’t see her as lost			2
i know a lot of 20 - somethings and they ’re all messed up			0
but when you ’re out in the public , you ’re magnified 100 per cent , and i can understand how you ’d go a little bit further			0
but she was ultimately very nice			0
' however , the film 's director , @entity49 , told a very different story of his experience working with the troubled star earlier this month			1
according to @entity80 , he was quoted as saying that ' tardiness , tantrums , absences , neediness , psychodrama ' plagued the shoot			0
not over yet : she looked happy to leave @entity4 on tuesday , but on their advice to the judge in her probation case , @entity1 must attend three 50 - minute therapy sessions a week for 16 months a sentiment echoed by @entity1 's co-star , @entity46 - @entity96 's sex - tape partner and porn star - who reportedly said working with the actress was akin to working with ' a child '			1

meanwhile , @entity1 may have left rehab on tuesday beaming from ear to ear , but it has since been revealed that staff at the rehab facility are fearful that she will return to her old ways			0

on the home stretch : @entity1 's lawyer , @entity126 , says it was the star 's decision to have a sober companion and she is ' doing well ' , adding , ' she is so positive and [ wants to get ] her life on the right track ' ' our entire clinical team is in unanimous agreement that if these sessions are not required by the court and attendance verified once a month to ensure accountability , it is a set up for almost certain failure , ' was the ominous warning given to judge @entity141			1
in open court this morning , the judge agreed to the recommendation terms , which state that @entity1 must participate in three 50 - minute therapy sessions per week for the next 16 months			1
' this should be done face - to - face while she is in town and via @entity150 or phone session if she is out of town , ' the document specifies			1
