yesterday , mr @entity8 said ' categorically ' denied he was behind the police clean - up operation , saying the claims were ' unfounded ' , according to the @entity41			1
@entity15 police said the forceful approach was in response to complaints by right - wing politicians and petitions from residents over the past three months			1
but local officers reportedly said the move came ' because madame @entity8 was very shocked by women begging with their babies			2
it was a humanitarian response			2
' ms @entity19 , a classically trained violinist , is no stranger to controversy			1
