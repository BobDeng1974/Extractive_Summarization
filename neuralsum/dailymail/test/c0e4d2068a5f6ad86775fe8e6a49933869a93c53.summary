the headline sounds almost too good to be true , does n't it ? but this one is perhaps as close to a sure bet as you 'll find - the secret to winning at @entity5 , @entity7 's iconic game of chance			1
punting analyst @entity9 has outlined an approach , known in gambling parlance as the @entity13 staking plan is outlined in the table below , but seems simple enough to follow for even a first - time @entity5 player			1
the essence being , that if you lose , you have to double your bet until your coins fall right			1
a word to the wise however , there is , as with any supposed sure - bet , or an almost ca n't lose system , a catch - and that is that you 'll need a healthy bank of cash with you			1
it is now legal to be played on @entity28 across @entity52 clubs ( @entity52 ) and pubs			2
versions will vary between the original two - coined game ( with three outcomes ) and three - coined version ( with two outcomes ) , the latter preferred by many venues prefer for ease of betting between punters			1
' one of the most easy to understand betting staking strategies that punters use is what i call the approach , otherwise known as the @entity34 , ' writes mr @entity9 , author of ' @entity68 doubles up to win ' for the website @entity69			2
it 's a system of betting which originated in @entity35			2
' a punter simply bets a stake to win an amount of money , if they fail to win with the first bet they increase their stake to recover their losses plus win the initial targeted win amount on the second bet and so on , ' he added			2
@entity84 # amount 1 $ 1 2 $ 2 3 $ 4 4 $ 8 5 $ 16 6 $ 32 7 $ 64 8 $ 128 9 $ 256 10 $ 512 * from @entity9 's " @entity68 doubles up to win " ' to simplify this betting strategy , let 's take a simple coin toss where the outcome is even money each time			2
' i bet $ 1 on heads for the first toss to win $ 1			2
' if the bet loses , i will bet $ 2 on the second toss			2
if i win on the second toss i have recovered my earlier loss of $ 1 plus my target winning amount of $ 1 , otherwise if i lose i will have to bet $ 4 on the third toss to recover the $ 3 lost and still win my targeted win amount			1
' if i continued to experience successive losses i double the stake of the previous wager until a win occurs			0
' ' the @entity105 staking approach is alluring to punters because of its seemingly guaranteed approach to make a buck , ' he stated			0
' i mean how many losers can you back in a row after all ? the game was still illegal in some @entity7 states and territories up until 10 years ago			1
wagering expert @entity117 , who writes for website @entity119 , told @entity120 that : ' it 's that one time of the year when the law permits men and women across this great country of ours to follow in the footsteps of our brave @entity7 diggers and keep to the old gambling tradition			1
' ' @entity5 is a pretty simple game , all you need are coins , a wooden stick ( the kip ) to flip them into the air and a crowd of screaming punters yelling " heads " or " tails "			1
' most punters have their corner , you are either a @entity138 punter , a @entity139 punter or someone who goes with either depending on your intuition			0
' the double - up approach is alluring to punters because it seems to provide a guaranteed approach to making a buck			0
if you win you 're happy and if you lose you increase your stake until you win			2
' sounds easy enough right ? but what are the real odds of winning and losing if you chose to use the double - up approach on @entity28 ? ' think back to @entity28 last year and recall how many successive loses that a @entity138 or a @entity153 endured over the entire day			1
was it four , five ? ' what are the chances of experiencing six losses in a row ? it 's actually about two per cent but that means it is actually possible			0
' on the bright side there is a 98 per cent chance that you would have made your money before this point			0
' ' come in @entity169 ' is the cry from the @entity171 at two up games the coins fly into the air during a game of @entity5 , the uniquely @entity7 tradition , in which punters bet on which way coins land			1
it is celebrated on @entity28 on april 25 and is associated with soldiers because it was popular with troops during @entity185 @entity187 soldiers pictured playing @entity5			1
" there is no form guide or books written on pushing the odds in your favour , as two - up is one of the fairest bets in the world			0
for every two - up coin toss there are two possible outcomes , @entity139 , and punters receive even money if the coins turn - up the right way , which is as true as the odds can get , ' said wagering guru @entity117 versions of @entity5 will vary between the original two - coined game ( with three outcomes ) and three - coined version ( with two outcomes ) , which many venues prefer for ease of betting between punters			1
@entity169 at the ready with the wooden @entity213 which is used to toss the coins			0
' the thing to remember is that each time you lose , the probability of winning the next bet in the example given is still even money ' warn some professional punters ' the attractiveness of this approach is certainly strong , however the downside , although rare in the example given , is very significant , ' mr @entity9 added			1
' if successive losses continue , the amount that needs to be wagered increases significantly			0
' the other thing to remember is that each time you lose , the probability of winning the next bet in the example given is still even money			1
' the odds do n't change because you have already incurred such significant losses			0
' i spoke with an ex on - line betting executive recently and asked if the @entity105 betting approach was common amongst punters and he indicated that it was noted frequently			0
' he mentioned a time when a punter endured 16 consecutive losses in - a - row with the last $ 69,000 bet failing before it appeared as though his bankroll had run out			0
" that 's the problem with this approach that most punters do not realise " he said			0
" it only guarantess success if you have an infinite amount of cash "			0
mr @entity117 offered a similar warning : ' before you run off to the @entity254 to load yourself up in readiness for a double - up day of two - up , remember that the perception of guaranteed success that punters have about the double - up approach is not entirely accurate			0
' ' the only way that it can guarantee a win is if you have an infinite amount of cash and an infinite number of coin tosses , neither of which are available to punters tomorrow			0
' two @entity5 is one of @entity7 's longest lasting traditions and is legal to be played on @entity28 across @entity52 clubs ( @entity52 ) and pubs and has been permitted for @entity7 and @entity276 troops deployed overseas during this time of year			1

punting aces say they have found a way to beat the odds in @entity7 's iconic game of chance
if you lose a bet then keep doubling up until the coins fall your way
gambling experts say it is not vital to stick to your original call
most rsls and pubs across @entity7 will feature games of @entity5
