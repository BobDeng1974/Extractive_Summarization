a wide - eyed @entity0 got to meet @entity1 at the weekend during a surprise family visit to a winter wonderland			1
the 17 - month - old future king clapped his hands in excitement as he toured @entity8 ’s @entity7 at @entity9 , close to the family ’s new country home in @entity13 with his parents the @entity15 and @entity16			1
members of the public could n’t believe their eyes as the royal party , who had booked their tickets ( £ 15 for children and £ 9.50 for adults ) in advance , toured the popular attraction with a discreet coterie of bodyguards			2
he also got to see real life elves hard at work making toys in @entity45 and met giant - sized teddy bears preparing to load presents into his sleigh for delivery on @entity51			1
the highlight of his festive treat , however , was when he summoned up the courage to toddle through a magical forest and go into @entity1 ’s house so he could meet the great man himself			2
@entity58 had the chance to chat to @entity1 while @entity60 and @entity16 stood beside him and was given a gift - wrapped wooden train as a present – an ideal present for the youngster who loves his ‘ choo choos ’			1
surprise visit : members of the public could n’t believe their eyes as the royal party turned up at @entity8 ’s @entity7 at @entity9 ( pictured above ) staff were only told that they were getting an unofficial @entity72 visit shortly before their arrival with other members of the @entity75			1
@entity60 and @entity16 , who is pregnant with her second child , were given a standard timed slot on arrival and queued patiently with other parents			1
general manager , @entity80 , said : ‘ @entity58 seemed to have a lovely time			0
when i saw him , he was walking around			0
‘ it was a private visit and they were not given any special treatment			2
we only knew shortly beforehand that they were coming			2
‘ they went around the winding path in our exhibition centre and would have seen animated animals like polar bears , penguins and reindeers as well as elves and snowmen			1
short notice : staff were only told that they were getting an unofficial @entity72 visit shortly before their arrival with other members of the @entity75 family ‘ it is a fantasy land and the animated elves tell stories which you can listen to as you go round			1
it is all very traditional and is designed for families with young children			0
‘ they would also have seen @entity45 before going to @entity1 ’s house			2
there were lots of different things for them to see and they were treated just like everyone else			0
‘ the visit including going into @entity8 ’s house usually takes at least 45 minutes , but they seemed to be here a long time			1
they did n’t miss anything and they had a good time			0
‘ lots of people recognised them , but they did n’t get any hassle and nobody tried to take any pictures of them			0
” miss @entity127 added : ‘ @entity1 speaks to the children who stand in front of him with their parents			0
the only other person in the room is an elf who sorts out the presents			0
‘ what he says to them and their parents is private			0
only @entity1 and his elf know what has been said			0
‘ the children are given different gifts according to their age and @entity58 would have got a wooden train just like other boys who are his age			0
’ royal invitation : keen to show off their new ten - bedroom mansion , @entity151 , @entity60 and @entity16 are hosting an extravagant festive celebration for @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 sources have told the @entity158 that @entity60 , @entity16 and @entity58 – as well as the rest of the @entity75 – arrived in @entity13 on thursday for what has been described as a ‘ perfect family @entity1 ’			1
keen to show off their new ten - bedroom mansion , @entity151 , situated on the @entity165 ’s @entity164 estate , @entity60 and @entity16 are hosting an extravagant festive celebration for @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156			1
the house , which boasts its own swimming pool and tennis court , was a wedding gift from the @entity165 and has recently undergone a multi-million pound refit			0
it is just a short drive from her private country residence , @entity164 , where the rest of the @entity177 are congregating for their annual holiday			0
now that @entity16 ’s family has joined the extended gathering for the first time , the question remains : will they be invited to join the @entity165 at church on @entity186 or one of the daily hunting parties enjoyed by the royals over the festive season , including the coveted @entity191 pheasant shoot ? ‘ @entity193 has long been keen to host big family @entity1 in her new home , the kind of @entity1 she enjoyed as a girl , and most of the @entity199 duly arrived on thursday afternoon , ’ the source revealed			2
previous family day out : @entity193 of @entity201 holds @entity0 as he and prince @entity60 look on while visiting the @entity204 exhibition at the @entity205 in july ‘ it ’s not clear yet whether the @entity16 ’s family have been invited to join the @entity165 , but it would n’t surprise me at all to see them walking to @entity210 and even join everyone for lunch before returning to @entity213 in the evening			1
‘ it will be quite a turn up for books if they do , but the @entity165 does n’t do anything by the book when it comes to @entity60 ’s new family			1
’ aides say that the @entity15 and @entity16 will joined the @entity165 for church on christmas morning without their toddler son .			0
