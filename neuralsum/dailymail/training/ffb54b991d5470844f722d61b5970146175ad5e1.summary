could this be @entity1 's best joke yet — or just another hoax claiming the legendary comedian is still alive ? a friend of @entity6 's claims in a new book that the comedian faked his own death in 1984 and will soon emerge for a comeback			1
@entity11 , who is famous for being @entity6 's close friend and writing partner , says that @entity6 began talking about faking his passing long before his lung cancer death in may 1984 , aged 35			1
' could you imagine how this is going to blow everyone 's mind ? ' @entity6 told @entity19 , according to claims from his book ' @entity1 : @entity24 , finally , ' as reported by the @entity23			1
@entity11 — who is not the first person to make fake - death claims about @entity6 — says he had many conversations with his comedic partner about pulling the macabre stunt			1
the two met at the @entity41 in @entity42 , where @entity11 refused to take part in the stunt fearing legal repercussions			0
shortly after that , @entity6 told him he would ' fake my death by making people believe i had terminal cancer , ' the @entity23 reported			1
' people get really wigged out when you start f --- ing with death , ' @entity11 told the comedian , according to the newspaper			0
later , when @entity6 began to cough randomly , @entity11 confronted him and said : ' stop with the coughing already — i think it 's a dead giveaway			2
' ' i do n't know , ' @entity6 shot back , according to the @entity23			0
' everyone seems to believe it			0
' @entity6 then began joking that he was dying because he ' ate too much chocolate , ' but later changed his mind			0
' maybe i 'll just stick with cancer , ' he said , according to the tabloid			0
@entity11 points to one of @entity6 's scripts — written some four years before he died — as evidence that the comedic genius was already planning on making a swift escape from life			1
the script , from 1980 's ' the @entity74 , ' says : ' @entity75 , at the age of 45 , died of cancer at @entity78 in @entity79 , @entity80			2
' four years later , 35 - year - old @entity6 would die of the same disease — at the same hospital			1
then he outlined his plan for @entity19			0
' if i was going to be a little boy about it , i 'd go into hiding for one or two years , ' he said , according to the @entity23			0
' but if i was going to be a man about it , it 'd be 20 or 30 years			1
' @entity6 's comedic collaborator , @entity11 , co-wrote the book that claims @entity6 is returning soon with the comedian 's girlfriend , @entity93			1
she does not think @entity6 may still be alive by that point , @entity11 says , the whole thing started to feek ' pretty f --- ed up			0
' ' @entity11 it 's who i am and what i do , ' @entity6 told @entity19 , according to the @entity23			2
' nothing could ever top it			0
' i 've given it great thoughts			0
besides , i 'm getting psyched — i 'm starting an entire new life			0
' @entity6 then apparently found a body double — who was actually dying of cancer — and started to mimic the man 's condition and appearance so his illness appeared legitimate			1
once that man died , he was buried as @entity6 while the comedian took off to begin a new life away from the spotlight			1
@entity11 says he 's finally telling his story after giving @entity6 the 30 years he said he 'd take to hide before coming back and revealing his prank			1
@entity1 portrays character @entity121 on the sitcom ' taxi ' in 1979 he co-wrote the book , which comes out october 7 , with @entity6 's girlfriend @entity93			1
but @entity127 — who @entity19 claims was not let into @entity6 's supposed fake death — defends yet another theory of how her boyfriend passed			1
in the book , she ' floats the possibility ' that @entity6 was bisexual and actually died of @entity134 , the @entity23 reported			2
@entity127 and @entity11 claim that @entity6 would often pick up men for sex in @entity138 's @entity137 , according to the @entity23			2
@entity6 asked the couple to keep his sexuality a secret until his parents died , the duo claims			1
since his death in 1984 , @entity6 has been the subject of many fake - death hoaxes			1
even some of his closest friends still believe he may have pulled off the stunt			0
supposed @entity6 appearances , sometimes as his character @entity75 at comedy clubs , began shortly after his death			2
@entity6 performs at @entity155 in @entity156 just last year , a 24 - year - old woman emerged at the @entity158 in @entity156 — and was introduced by @entity6 's brother @entity159 as the late comedian 's daughter			2
@entity162 told the crowd at the @entity164 that he had received a letter from his brother some 15 years after his passing , and that he was alive and well , according to @entity168			0
then just a few days later , @entity162 appeared on @entity169 to say he 'd been duped			0
' i believe i am part of a hoax , ' @entity6 's brother said			2
@entity173 , @entity6 's longtime manager , told @entity169 that he saw the comedian die			2
' @entity1 's very much alive in our hearts , but i do n't think his body is around , ' @entity173 told @entity169			1
i was in the hospital			0
' the hoaxes have become so intense , the @entity180 last year re-released @entity6 's death certificate to put an end to the speculation			1
in a statement , the coroner 's office said only : ' @entity1 is dead			0
' @entity6 performs on @entity188 in 1982			0

@entity1 's writing partner says the legend talked often about faking his own death and is about to return , after going into exile for 30 years
