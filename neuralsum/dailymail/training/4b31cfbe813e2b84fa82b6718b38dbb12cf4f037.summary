by @entity0 published : 04:38 est , 24 april 2012 updated : 12:49 est , 24 april 2012 @entity2 chiefs @entity1 and @entity3 and filmmaker @entity4 are bankrolling a venture to extract precious metals such as platinum from asteroids that orbit near @entity9			1
@entity11 , based in @entity12 , @entity13 , initially will focus on developing and selling extremely low - cost robotic spacecraft for surveying missions , the company announced today			1
a demonstration mission in orbit around @entity9 is expected to be launched within two years , said company co-founders @entity18 and @entity20			0
it plans to tap some of the thousands of asteroids that pass relatively close to @entity9 and extract their raw materials			1
a 98 - foot asteroid can hold as much as $ 50 billion worth of platinum ( Â£ 31 billion ) at today 's prices , said a company spokesperson			1
not all missions would return precious metals and minerals to @entity9			0
in addition to mining for platinum and other precious metals , the company plans to tap asteroids ' water to supply orbiting fuel depots , which could be used by @entity59 and others for robotic and human space missions			1
' we have a long view			0
we 're not expecting this company to be an overnight financial home run			0
this is going to take time , ' @entity20 said in an interview with @entity68			0
the real payoff , which is decades away , will come from mining asteroids for platinum group metals and rare minerals			2
@entity59 has already successsfully landed a probe on an asteroid , @entity75 , 196 million miles from @entity9 ' if you look back historically at what has caused humanity to make its largest investments in exploration and in transportation , it has been going after resources , whether it 's the @entity84 going after the spice routes or the @entity87 settlers looking toward the west for gold , oil , timber or land , ; @entity18 said			2
' those precious resources caused people to make huge investments in ships and railroads and pipelines			0
looking to space , everything we hold of value on earth - metals , minerals , energy , real estate , water - is in near - infinite quantities in space			1
' the opportunity exists to create a company whose mission is to be able to go and basically identify and access some of those resources and ultimately figure out how to make them available where they are needed , ' he said			0
@entity18 and @entity20 declined to discuss how much money has been raised for their venture so far			0
in addition to @entity2 billionaires @entity1 and @entity3 and filmmaker @entity4 , @entity11 investors include former @entity126 chief software architect @entity125 , a two - time visitor to the @entity128 , @entity2 founding director @entity129 and @entity130 planetary resources also declined to discuss specifics about how and when asteroid mining would begin			1
@entity59 's infrared sky - scans track space objects such as asteroids			2
a recent scan with the @entity139 instruments found that there were 19,000 ' mid-sized ' asteroids within 120 million miles of @entity9 backing : film maker and explorer @entity4 ( left ) is supporting the project , as is billionaire @entity125 ( right ) untapped resource : @entity59 scientists say the high concentration of raw materials found in asteroids could supply @entity9 with vital stockpiles of natural resources space man : entrepreneur @entity18 the shortage of sources for raw materials on the planet has caused global inflation to spike in recent years causing tensions to rise between nations , experts have said			1
the company 's first step is to develop technologies to cut the cost of deep - space robotic probes to one - tenth to one - hundredth the cost of current space missions , which run hundreds of millions of dollars , @entity18 said			2
among the targeted technologies is optical laser communications , which would eliminate the need for large radio antennas aboard spacecraft			0
space entrepreneurs @entity18 and @entity20 are just two of the names behind @entity177			0
in a press release , the company announced its intentions to create ' a new industry in space and a new definition of natural resources '			0
@entity18 and @entity20 - both known for their aspirations for commercial space exploration - will host the launch event along with two former @entity59 officials			1
a driving force behind the @entity192 competition to spur on non-goverment space flight , @entity18 has made no secret of his goal to one day become an asteroid miner			2
in an interview earlier this year with @entity198 , he said : ' the earth is a crumb in a supermarket of resources			0
' now we finally have the technology to extract resources outside earth for the benefit of humanity without having to rape and pillage our planet			2
' @entity211 film maker @entity4 is no stranger to daring exploration			1
just last month the director of @entity214 and @entity215 became the first solo diver to reach the bottom of the @entity218 - the deepest point on @entity9			0
radical concept , but old idea : experts believe it is only now that we have the ability to discover and characterise a sufficient number of small near - @entity9 asteroids straight out of a sci - fi film : a scene from the movie @entity230 , where @entity233 's character is sent into space to mine an asteroid before it hits the @entity9 it might seem like a radical concept , but scientists have been toying with the idea of mining asteroids for their natural resources for longer than the space program has been running			1
experts believe it is only now that we have the technology and ability to discover and characterise a sufficient number of small near - earth asteroids ( @entity251 )			1
the mining could yield a large amount of water - frozen inside the asteroids - oxygen and metals which could not only be brought back to @entity9 but could help further space exploration by allowing humans to fuel spacecraft and build space stations			1
@entity59 believes capturing placing an @entity251 in lunar orbit could provide a unique , meaningful and easy - to - reach destination for exploration by astronaut crews in the next decade			2
it is only now that the sufficiently - powerful electric propulsion systems necessary to transport a captured @entity251 are becoming available			0
mining asteroids could take several forms			0
this includes sending humans in a spacecraft to an asteroid to explore and mine it			1
another possible scenario could involve launching a robotic spacecraft to either to mine an asteroid directly or transport it closer to @entity9 so it could be reached by humans more easily			1
extracting raw materials , such as iron and nickel , from the space rocks is a possibility that has been discussed for decades			1
however , the obstacles for such a mission has always been the cost , sufficient scientific expertise and technical prowess			0
it could cost tens of billions of dollars - and could take well over a decade - for astronauts to successfully land on an asteroid , @entity59 experts have said in the past			2

scientists *due* to unveil plans to extract raw materials from space rocks
plan would add ' trillions ' to global *gdp*
one 100 - foot asteroid can contain $ 50 billion of platinum
spacecraft could mine near - earth rocks for platinum
platforms will also allow further exploration of space
