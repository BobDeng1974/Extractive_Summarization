@entity11 , 34 , ( left ) from @entity13 , boasted on @entity8 that he was ' free ' after judge @entity18 ( right ) handed him a suspended sentence for assaulting his wife and intimidating a witness judge @entity18 also ordered him to partake in an alcohol treatment order and made him the subject of a restraining order , but his judgement has been largely criticised by top police chiefs who have deemed the ruling as ' wholly wrong '			1
according to the @entity35 , @entity11 bit and tried to choke his partner when she spoke about them splitting up at their @entity13 home in april last year			2
he also threatened to shoot her in the eye , before firing a pellet into her foot before she managed to escape			2
days after he was arrested , @entity11 rang her and said ' drop the charges or i will torch ... ' but she put the phone down before he could finish the threat , the newspaper report said			2
two police crime commissioners and a domestic abuse charity have now criticised the judge for the ' lenient ' sentence , with one calling for judges to be given more training			2
@entity58 , @entity13 's @entity59 , said : ' this judgement totally beggars belief			1
it is astonishing considering what he has done			0
' speaking about @entity11 's foul - mouthed boasting on @entity8 , mr @entity58 added : ' his response to getting off free is just outrageous			1
' this is not justice in any way			0

judge @entity18 , who handed @entity11 the sentence at @entity17 ( pictured ) , has come under fire for the ' lenient ' sentence with police crime commissioners describing it as ' astonishing ' and ' wholly wrong ' she highlighted judge @entity18 's remarks where he reportedly said the defendant had not been in trouble for seven years			1
' domestic violence is a private crime , it 's a secret crime and to say that the guy has behaved himself for seven years is a very poor reason for dealing with him leniently , ' she said			0
' we have no idea how he was behaving in the house			0
' i think the judge has got it wholly wrong and we have to train our judges properly			1
' @entity100 , director of @entity101 , said : ' i feel a combination of disbelief and fury			0
' she was shocked the witness intimidation charge alone did not warrant a jail sentence			1
' on every level the judge has failed in his duty , ' she said			0
the @entity111 can not appeal to the attorney general about the leniency of the sentence			0
a @entity111 spokesman said : ' there is limited provision made within law for prosecutors to challenge a sentence which they believe to be an unduly lenient			0
' however , there are strict guidelines on the type of cases that prosecutors can refer to the attorney general 's office for consideration			0
' @entity129 assault and intimidation are both offences for which a referral would not be possible under existing legislation			2
