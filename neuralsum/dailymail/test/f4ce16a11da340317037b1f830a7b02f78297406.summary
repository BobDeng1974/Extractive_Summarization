this is a shocking collection of harrowing photographs of the death and destruction visited on @entity4 by @entity6 @entity5 a century ago that were taken by an @entity7 and a colleague who risked imprisonment to smuggle them out and show the world the full horror of what happened			1
@entity14 and @entity15 both documented the unimaginable suffering they witnessed in images which helped build a case against a @entity21 government which still denies the slaughter of up to 1.5million @entity4 constituted genocide			1
as @entity4 mark 100 years since the atrocities , many @entity25 countries still do not use that word , and @entity7 president @entity28 is once again unlikely to do so in his upcoming statement marking the anniversary despite pledging he would during his election campaign			1
more than 150,000 @entity4 children were left parentless by the end of 1918 @entity4 deportees travel on foot in 1915 as taken by @entity15 , including women and children on an unpaved road in the desert sun a crowd looks on as @entity4 are hanged in the street in @entity45 before their forced removal to the desert had begun after april 1915 this image was titled ' abandoned and murdered small children of the ( @entity4 ) deportees ' by @entity15 and was taken in 1915 - 1916 @entity15 , a volunteer military nurse , set up clandestine mail routes with foreign consulates and embassies to get many hundreds of notes , annotations , documents , letters and photographs of the @entity4 deportation camps to @entity60 and the @entity7			1
he did so in defiance of strict orders from the @entity21 and @entity60 authorities aimed at preventing any evidence of the horrors of the ' genocide ' reaching the outside world			1
but his ruse was discovered and he was arrested by the @entity60 authorities and put to serve in cholera wards in @entity71 at the request of the @entity21 command			1
there he fell seriously ill , and @entity60 - born @entity15 left for @entity45 ( modern - day @entity75 ) in november 1916			1
hidden in his belt were his photographic plates , and those of other @entity60 officers , with images of the @entity4 massacre to which he had been a witness			1
his images , which along with @entity14 's were provided to @entity85 by the @entity87 - based @entity86 , still retain the power to shock as the world marks the 100th anniversary of the ' genocide ' today			1
in one , two @entity4 are pictured hanging in the street in broad daylight in the capital @entity45 while a crowd , including women and children , looks on			2
the image was taken in 1915 just before the mass deportation of @entity4 to the desert had begun			2
hundreds of thousands were forced from their homes in @entity104 and herded towards @entity105			0
a skeleton iresting in a refugee graveyard while a black clad figure walks away from the camera in @entity110 , now in @entity104 in @entity5 @entity4 deportees sleeping in the street in 1915 in the @entity105 region of the @entity6			2
they are mostly women without families orphans of the massacre take a rest			0
hundreds of thousands of @entity4 were forced from their homes in @entity104 and herded towards @entity105 three generations of the same family of refugees take shelter from the son in a makeshift tent			0
many of those targeted for expulsion starved to death , were shot or bayoneted by @entity21 soldiers genocide is defined as the ' deliberate and systematic extermination of a national , racial , political , or cultural group			2
' it was apparently coined by @entity134 - born @entity7 jurist @entity133 in his work ' @entity136 in @entity137 ' in reference to the @entity140 extermination of the @entity141			0
the word literally means ' killing a tribe ' from the @entity145 ' genos ' meaning ' race ' or ' kind ' @entity133 wrote that : ' it is intended to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aimed at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups , with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves			0
' thanks to @entity133 's campaigning work , the @entity156 adopted the @entity159 on december 9 , 1948			0
the then two million strong @entity4 minority were persecuted by a government suspicious that as @entity162 they were more loyal to @entity162 governments like that of @entity165 than they were to the @entity6 caliphate			1
though they had thrived under @entity6 rule , despite being regarded as ' infidels ' by their @entity170 rulers , the @entity4 were resented for their relative prosperity and success compared to many @entity6			0
the @entity6 government began their campaign in earnest after @entity4 organized volunteer battalions to help the @entity165 army fight against the @entity5 in the @entity178			2
the @entity6 government used this as a justification to begin their forced ' removal ' of @entity4 the war zones along the @entity183 in a bid to ' @entity185 ' what remained of a ailing empire			2
the deportation began following the rounding up of 235 @entity4 leaders and intellectuals in the capital on april 24 , 1915 - the anniversary of which is marked today			0
many of those then targeted for expulsion starved to death , were shot or bayoneted by @entity21 soldiers			0
another photograph shows the bodies of three murdered young boys lying in a gutter , one of them stripped naked , while two others look on			0
more than 150,000 @entity4 children were left parentless by the end of the @entity208			0
and in a third of @entity15 's incredible images taken in 1915 , a band of @entity4 deportees , including a woman carrying a baby , children and elderly men , stagger through the desert along an unpaved road in the blazing suns towards their hellish new lives as refugees			1
@entity14 , from @entity222 , was a relief worker in the @entity4 capital of @entity224 from 1917 to 1919			1
refugees struggle to make their way along the @entity110 road			0
the city was occupied in 1920 and is now part of a region of eastern @entity5 ' a 15 - year - old child who died of starvation ' , according to @entity15 , who took the image of the two bodies of young boys in 1915 - 1916 @entity4 deportees living in the open desert with bedding as their only shelter , though luckier families in the background have tents he also painted a heartrending picture of the nightmare he witnessed using his camera			1
the divinity student defied instructions given to relief workers and other foreign personnel to evacuate the @entity178 , fearing that tens of thousands more @entity4 would die of starvation if the relief programs were discontinued			0
he and fellow @entity254 colleague @entity252 remained at their posts channeling relief fund to orphanages and soup kitchens			0
the pair were instrumental in providing care for thousands of @entity4 orphans and arranging for the training and employment of 11,000 adults			0
@entity14 's pictures of orphans are particularly harrowing , some of them clearly starving with angular bones poking through the stretched skin of their shrunken bodies			2
in one eerie shot a human skeleton is pictured resting in a refugee graveyard while a black clad figure walks away from the camera in the background			0
in another refugees desperately forage for food by a railway track			0
in light of such evidence @entity28 's reticence to use the word ' genocide ' , in a bid to placate @entity7 's @entity21 allies , has disappointed many			1
several @entity7 officials said there had been a sharp internal debate over whether to use the 100 - year anniversary to call the killings ' genocide ' and make good on the president 's campaign promise , particularly after @entity296 used the term earlier this month			1

the city is now called @entity301 , the second largest in @entity4 @entity15 ( left ) fearlessly documented the horror with his camera just like @entity14 , who took this image of an @entity4 refugee ( right ) a burial service is held at a deportation camp			1
@entity15 describe the scene as ' @entity4 deportees living in the open desert under makeshift tents			1
clothing of some deportees is already worn to rags ' a painfully thin orphan of the massacre ( left ) taken by @entity14 in @entity224 , now the capital of @entity4 , in 1918			1
@entity15 captioned the image on the right : ' fleeing from death			0
an @entity4 mother on the heights of the @entity326 whose husband has been killed ' that comment by the @entity296 prompted an angry response from @entity5 , which recalled its ambassador to the @entity330			0
several @entity332 governments and parliaments are also expected to use the word in discussions of the events 100 years ago			1
the number of @entity4 who died during this period is in fact only around 300,000 , according to @entity5 , which still blames ' war and disease ' rather than a targeted programme of extermination by the @entity6 government			2
@entity346 , the @entity21 president , said at a press conference on wednesday he ' would not want @entity28 to use the word " genocide " and would not expect such a thing			1
' the country 's prime minister @entity351 accused the @entity353 of ' enmity ' against @entity5 over its vote to use the term to describe the killings			0
in his formal statement on the anniversary he also insisted that @entity4 losses were among many in the @entity208 and that it was a form of ' discrimination ' to focus on @entity4 and not on ' @entity21 and @entity364 ' who died at the same time			1
his words did not stop dozens of @entity4 from gathering on wednesday for an annual commemoration ceremony at a chasm at a site called @entity370 , near the city of @entity372 in southeastern @entity5 , where it is believed there is a mass grave to victims of the ' genocide '			2
around 10,000 are thought to have been led here by @entity21 military police in 1915 before being brutally murdered and thrown into the cleft in the rock			2
at the @entity385 in @entity224 today @entity165 president @entity382 and @entity384 president @entity383 joined @entity387 leader @entity386 and @entity389 president @entity388 at the 100th anniversary ceremony remembering the ' genocide '			0

@entity7 president @entity28 ( right ) continues to avoid using the word ' genocide ' in connection with what happened to the @entity4 at the hands of the @entity6			1

@entity14 and @entity15 both documented the unimaginable suffering they witnessed through horror pictures
@entity15 used secret mail routes to *sneak* images out but was caught by @entity60 police and sent to cholera ward
helped build case against @entity21 government which still denies killing of up to 1.5million @entity4 was genocide
as world marks 100 years since the atrocities many @entity25 governments including the @entity7 still do not use the word
