by @entity0 published : 05:03 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 11:34 est , 6 december 2012 twinkling city lights , raging wildfires and colorful auroras are lit up in new dazzling nighttime views of the @entity5			1
they show @entity8 's major cities bathed in light , with @entity10 and it 's sprawling suburbs clearly visible			2
they incredible images were taken from a newly - launched @entity17 - @entity16 satellite that 's equipped with a sensor to observe the planet at night			1
the image was made possible by the new satellite 's ' day - night band ' which can spot lighting more accurately than ever before @entity17 's @entity27 camera uses a new technique to capture night images			1
unlike a normal camera that captures a picture in one exposure , the day - night band produces an image by repeatedly scanning a scene and resolving it as millions of individual pixels			0
then , the day - night band reviews the amount of light in each pixel			0
if it is very bright , a low - gain mode prevents the pixel from oversaturating			0
if the pixel is very dark , the signal is amplified			0
this allows the instrument to capture images on nights with or without moonlight , producing crisp views of @entity5 's atmosphere , land and ocean surfaces			1
the satellite , @entity27 , was launched on october 28 , 2011			1
it 's latest images show the @entity57 bathed in city lights , while a map of the @entity60 shows the heavily populated @entity61 illuminated			1
light from fishing boats can also be pinpointed			0
' for all the reasons that we need to see @entity5 during the day , we also need to see @entity5 at night , ' @entity66 , a researcher at @entity16 's @entity67 , said in a @entity17 statement			1
' unlike humans , the @entity5 never sleeps			2
' @entity66 added : ' it 's like having three simultaneous low - light cameras operating at once and we pick the best of various cameras , depending on where we 're looking in the scene			2

illuminated : lights across the earth are pictured in this @entity17 handout satellite image the light fantastic : the @entity57 is pictured left with a night time view of @entity107 over @entity108 , right ' the night is nowhere as dark as we might think , ' @entity66 said			1
and with the @entity112 day - night band helping scientists to tease out information from human and natural sources of nighttime light , " we do n't have to be in the dark anymore , either			0
' ' the remarkable day - night band images from @entity27 have impressed the scientific community and exceeded our pre-launch expectations , " said @entity117 , @entity27 project scientist at @entity17 's @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity120 going global : this image obtained from @entity17 shows the entire @entity5 assembled from data acquired by the @entity27 satellite @entity127 : @entity128 can be seen as it gained strength before it pummeled the @entity61 in october fire light : this image captures a night time view of the @entity136 wildfires in @entity137 in this august 29 , 2012 satellite image from @entity17 ' the instrument can capture images on nights with or without moonlight , producing crisp views of @entity5 's atmosphere , land and ocean surfaces			1
the satellite also captured the glow from natural sources including moonlight , northern lights and naturally - occurring fires			2
after @entity128 made landfall in late october , hard - hit @entity154 , lower @entity155 and the @entity156 appeared dark in the satellite images compared with surrounding areas - the result of widespread power outages that plagued the region for days and weeks following the storm			2
@entity163 , program scientist for @entity16 's @entity164 , said : ' @entity16 's @entity165 is continuing to explore the use of the day - night band			2
the very high resolution from @entity112 data will take forecasting weather events at night to a much higher level			0
' lit up : this image provided by @entity17 shows the @entity61 of the @entity60 brightened by lights in this night images taken from space what 's up with the north ? the @entity178 is seen at night from a composite assembled from data acquired by the @entity27 satellite			1
where @entity183 is gleaming with city lights , @entity182 has hardly any lights at all			0

pictures came from @entity17 - @entity16 satellite , @entity27 , which was launched on october 28 , 2011
images providing *breathtaking* views of the @entity5 , including the @entity57 and @entity60 's @entity61
