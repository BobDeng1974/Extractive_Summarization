autism is mainly caused by a child ’s genes , a major study of @entity2 twins has found			1
scientists said that , in the average boy or girl with autism , genetics explain up to 98 per cent of the illness			2
the research , by @entity13 , found the condition is highly inheritable			2
controversial research linking autism with the @entity18 jab has been widely discredited , but more recent concern has focused on the condition being fuelled by environmental factors such as pollution			1
the team compared the behaviour of pairs of identical twins , who share all their dna , and non-identical twins , who have only half their genes in common ( file picture ) with cases of autism much more common today than in the past , many fear it is also being caused by modern lifestyles			1
estimates suggest that as many as one in 100 people in the @entity2 now has autism			0
but the researchers said their study suggested that lifestyle and environmental factors were a distant second to genetics			1
the team compared the behaviour of pairs of identical twins , who share all their dna , and non-identical twins , who have only half their genes in common			1
they found the condition was far more common in identical twins than in non-identical ones			1
the study , in the journal @entity55 , concluded that rogue @entity27 explains between 74 and 98 per cent of the cause of the average case of autism			2
if genes are key , the recent rise in cases could be explained by more people being correctly diagnosed with the condition			0
controversial research which linked autism with the @entity18 jab has now been widely discredited ( file picture ) dr @entity68 told the @entity69 : ‘ our findings suggest environmental factors are smaller , which is important because some parents are concerned whether things like high pollution might be causing autism			1
the main consensus now is that the rise in diagnosis has more to do with increased awareness of the condition			0
’ dr @entity81 , of the @entity82 , said : ‘ autism is a highly complex story of genes not only interacting with other genes , but with non-genetic factors too			2
‘ this large population - based twin sample is significant because it helps us to understand much more about the role genetics play in autism and opens up the possibility of whole families gaining a better understanding of a condition they may share			1
’ but she added : ‘ we are still a long way from knowing what leads to autism			0
‘ what people with the condition , their families and carers need most of all is access now to the right kind of support to be able to lead full lives			0
’ the study looked at 128 pairs of twins in which at least one sibling had an autism diagnosis , between the ages of 12 and 14			1
lead researcher @entity115 said : ‘ this study shows that the genes are very important and the increased rate of autism is more down to awareness than environmental factors			2
’ latest figures suggest more than one in 100 people in @entity2 has autism , including related conditions such as @entity128 ’s syndrome			0
this is a ten-fold increase on 30 years ago			0
symptoms vary , but usually revolve around difficulty with social interaction , communication problems and a need for a strict routine			0
many patients are treated with speech and behavioural therapy			0
although drugs can be prescribed to control symptoms such as aggression or hyperactivity , there is no cure .			0

controversial research has linked autism with @entity18 jab and environment
but researchers say lifestyle and *external* factors are second to genetics
study *carried* out on twins - it was far more common in identical pairs
