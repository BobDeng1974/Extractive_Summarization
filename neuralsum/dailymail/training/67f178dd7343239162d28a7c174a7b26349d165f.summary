by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it was much like any other monday at @entity3 , though a few more people than usual were lingering around what they call @entity6			1
that is probably selling it a bit short			2
for this is a mini-museum in the immaculately refurbished clubhouse that pays tribute to its most famous son , who on sunday was crowned @entity15 champion at @entity16			1
somehow they now need to find space in the shrine to @entity21 ’s career for a replica @entity23 to go alongside that of the @entity15 trophy , his @entity27 golf bag , @entity30 medal and the picture of him winning the @entity32			1
back at the club , members reminisced not just about the young @entity21 but the whole @entity59 clan who , over three generations , have become deeply woven into its fabric			1
@entity63 was a close friend of @entity21 ’s grandfather , @entity64 , who worked the cranes at the @entity67 shipyard			1
‘ we were in the club ’s snooker team together and we got our picture in the paper because all seven players were called @entity64 , ’ recalled mr @entity63 , the team ’s only survivor			1
@entity59 died suddenly after his retirement , leaving three sons - @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 , the latter the father of @entity21 who also worked behind the club bar			1
@entity83 out : @entity21 in the rough during his fourth round at the @entity85 lead from the font : the @entity87 finished the week on -17 , two shots clear of his nearest rivals @entity78 and @entity79 are both up on the board as past club champions , as is a 16 - year - old @entity21			1
past president @entity93 showed the area by the bar where @entity21 , aged just two , would chip balls with a tiny club			1
‘ he was quiet and very well mannered - a nice boy , ’ said @entity93			0
‘ he was already good at seven and his father wanted him to join			2
i proposed him but the problem was that at the time the minimum age limit was 12			0
' we had to change the club ’s constitution to allow him to join , but it was a very close vote			2
’ a legacy of that was the large number of schoolchildren playing competitions there yesterday			1
‘ it seems to be a magnet for young golfers now , ’ added @entity93			0
‘ we also have a lot more @entity114 visiting here			1
they want to see where @entity21 came from and a few have become overseas members			1
’ winner : @entity21 has won his third @entity120 at the age of 25 , becoming only the third to do so embrace : the champion celebrates with his mum after securing the win at @entity16 on sunday club general manager @entity126 was the professional when the future superstar was just learning the game			1
‘ at eight @entity21 ’s technique was very polished and by 13 he was probably better than me , to be honest , ’ said @entity126			1
‘ he used to come and play pro-ams with me , and i will always remember a shot he played at the @entity133 course at @entity134 that suggested he would be something special			2
‘ there was a fierce wind blowing across the hole and the pin was tucked away			0
he hit this four - iron from about 200 yards and somehow got it to hold its line to get to within a couple of feet			0
‘ it was the sort of shot that told you he would be outstanding - it was just a question of how good			0
’ others , like his father , clearly felt the same , which is why some placed long - term bets on the young @entity21 to become @entity15 champion by 26			1
one of them , @entity152 , is said to have collected £ 25,000 after sunday and , with the subject of his foresight returning to @entity48 on monday , had cause for a huge celebration			2
