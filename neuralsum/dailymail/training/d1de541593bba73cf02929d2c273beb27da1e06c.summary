by @entity0 published : 13:02 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 11:43 est , 5 april 2013 accused : the court heard pc @entity4 's @entity3 patrol car had reached a maximum speed of 108mph before the crash a police officer crashed his high - powered patrol car while driving at speeds of up to 108mph in a 40mph zone , a court has heard			1
pc @entity4 is alleged to have reached the ' grossly excessive ' speed shortly before his @entity3 5 series was badly damaged when it drove over a traffic island			1
the 46 - year - old officer , whose vehicle suffered a shredded tyre and broken suspension strut , denies driving dangerously on the @entity20 at @entity21 , @entity22 , while on duty with @entity24 on the night of october 26 , 2011			1
opening the case , prosecutor @entity25 told @entity27 the incident data recorder fitted to the @entity3 @entity3 showed the vehicle was travelling at 92mph when it struck the raised ' splitter ' island at about 10.30pm			1
mr @entity25 told jurors that @entity4 , who is based in @entity34 , @entity22 , contacted his supervisor by radio several minutes after the collision claiming to have hit a kerb			1
the court heard a colleague of @entity41 then attended the scene of the accident , which triggered the driver ’s airbag			2
mr @entity25 said : ' @entity4 explained that he had been chasing a car that he believed had been a stolen @entity47			1
' he was asked how fast he was driving and he said between 90 and 100mph			2
' after examining the roadway , the court heard , it became obvious to @entity51 and his colleague that the car had struck the central island			2
alleging that the defendant ’s driving fell way below the standard of a reasonable and prudent motorist , mr @entity25 said : ' where the collision had taken place the speed limit was 40mph			2
' therefore , an investigation into what had happened began internally within the police			0
' on trial : @entity27 @entity66 heard that investigators quickly realised @entity41 had not hit the kerb as he had claimed evidence for the inquiry was contained in the @entity3 ’s data recorder , which was analysed by a collision investigator			1
mr @entity25 told the jury : ' he ( the investigator ) has concluded that the maximum speed attained by @entity41 as he drove along that piece of road - after the 40mph started and before the collision - was 108mph			0
' analysis of a 26 - second section of the data available to investigators showed that the average speed of the car was between 98mph and 99mph			2
mr @entity25 told jurors : ' @entity88 ’s case is that this is grossly excessive speeding - so grossly excessive that it amounts to dangerous driving			1
' the court heard the accident happened at such speed the patrol car was sent almost half a mile down the road before coming to a stop			2
witness pc @entity97 , a collision investigator with @entity24 , told the jury tyre marks showed that the @entity3 went onto a grass verge on the wrong side of the road			0
mr @entity25 told jurors : ' @entity88 ’s case is that this is grossly excessive speeding - so grossly excessive that it amounts to dangerous driving			1
' he said : ' i was able to tell the vehicle had travelled 727 metres prior to coming to a stop			0
' ' there was about 26 metres before it goes onto the grass verge			0
it then travels along the grass verge and then comes back onto the road where it continues for some distance			0
' i was able to go back 26.5 seconds prior to the impact			0
the record starts just before the @entity3 enters the 40mph speed limit			0
' by the time the @entity3 returns to the carriageway ( after travelling along the grass verge ) it ’s travelling at 68mph			0
' the court heard @entity121 ’s ( @entity122 ) are fitted to all patrol cars and only start recording when the computer becomes concerned about the vehicle ’s activity			0
mr @entity4 denies dangerous driving and the trial continues			1
