by @entity1 correspondent morning walk : scientists in @entity4 say people who get out and about in the morning are thinner than those who go outside later in the day as ideas for losing weight go , this is certainly a bright one			1
scientists say that people who get out and about in the morning are thinner than those who go outside later in the day			0
they believe that bright morning light helps synchronise the body clock , which then helps regulate metabolism			1
the @entity14 researchers gave 54 men and women wrist monitors that recorded details of their light exposure , sleep and exercise for a week			1
the volunteers also kept a diary of all the food they ate			0
crunching the results revealed that those who were exposed to bright light before noon were lighter than others – even when exercise , diet and sleep were taken into account			1
the researchers , from @entity34 ’s @entity33 in @entity4 , said that the timing , intensity and duration of the light were all important			0
they say it would be hard to get enough light indoors and recommended we get out , even on a cloudy day			0
just 20 to 30 minutes is enough			2
the study ’s senior author dr @entity42 said : ‘ light is the most potent agent to synchronise your internal body clock that regulates circadian rhythms , which in turn also regulate energy balance			1
‘ if a person does n’t get sufficient light at the appropriate time of day , it could de-synchronise your internal body clock , which is known to alter metabolism and can lead to weight gain			2
‘ the message is that you should get more bright light between 8am and noon			2
’ take a break : researchers recommend that office workers take the chance to go outside during their lunch hour exposure : the results revealed that those who were exposed to bright light before noon were lighter than others ¿ even when exercise , diet and sleep were taken into account researcher dr @entity71 said : ‘ just like people are trying to get more sleep to help them lose weight , perhaps manipulating light is another way to lose weight			1
’ she recommends that office workers take the chance to go outside during their breaks and that lighting is improved in schools and work places			0
the journal @entity86 reports that is n’t entirely clear how bright morning light keeps us trim but it is known that light affects metabolism and feelings of hunger and satiety .			0
