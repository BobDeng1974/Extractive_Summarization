@entity0 warns the party is committing ' political suicide ' by questioning @entity4 's leadership @entity7 is committing ‘ political suicide ’ by questioning @entity4 ’s leadership , the party ’s former leader @entity0 warned last night			1
the peer , a mentor of mr @entity4 , emerged to spearhead an effort to shore him up as allies issued an extraordinary ‘ put up or shut up ’ challenge to mps undermining his position			2
mr @entity4 ’s new election campaign chief , @entity20 , admitted that briefing against him was leading to concern among voters ‘ about whether he ’s got the leadership qualities to lead his own party , let alone the country ’			1
speaking on @entity29 5live 's @entity28 , she said of the plotters : ‘ they need to decide what their plan is , and get on with it , either way			2
’ @entity7 endured claims yesterday that 20 shadow ministers will call for mr @entity4 to stand down if former home secretary @entity41 agrees to take over , and a poll showing his support among the party ’s own voters is at an all - time low			1
only 34 per cent of the ‘ core vote ’ which backed @entity7 under @entity47 in 2010 say mr @entity4 is up to the job of prime minister			1
mr @entity41 said yesterday : ‘ i am very supportive of @entity4 and i think he is doing a good job			1
but even if i did n’t , anyone who thinks that having a regicide six months before a general election of your leader who is neck - and - neck in the polls and has the prospect of winning the election after one term in opposition , which has only happened once in 80 years , should get a grip			1
’ critics privately suggest mr @entity4 has just weeks to save his job and a poor showing in the @entity65 by - election on november 20 – a seat @entity7 held until 2010 on slightly different boundaries , but now looks set to finish third behind @entity69 and the @entity70 – could tip him over the edge			1
former @entity7 mp @entity72 said yesterday mr @entity4 ‘ should go ’ and would be removed by the end of the week if ‘ one mp with the guts ’ told him to quit , while mr @entity47 ’s former spin doctor , @entity75 , added : ‘ if anyone was prepared to come forward now and actually do a formal challenge , i think the @entity4 camp would fold very quickly			2
’ @entity80 mp @entity79 , named last week in @entity81 as one of those pushing for mr @entity4 ’s removal , said : ‘ the numbers show us that he is not popular with the electorate and that ’s the reality of it			1
‘ so , what we need to do is to spread the load amongst the @entity92 and push some of them to the fore			0
let ’s not believe that more @entity4 , as i have heard said , is the way to win in the @entity53 in 2015			2
’ asked if mr @entity4 ‘ has what it takes ’ , former chancellor @entity100 , who backed mr @entity4 ’s brother @entity101 for the party leadership , replied : ‘ i think he does but he needs to show it			1
’ in addition , the @entity114 claimed that mr @entity4 ’s 2013 announcement on an energy bill freeze could end up increasing family bills because some firms have already frozen prices until 2017 – despite the fact that wholesale prices are falling			2
not one member of the @entity92 was prepared to appear on @entity126 ’s flagship political programme to defend @entity4 ’s leadership , the channel claimed yesterday			0
the @entity129 programme said it had asked all of the @entity132 ’s top team to appear , but was turned down			0
@entity47 ’s former spin doctor , @entity75 , said : ‘ it ’s extraordinary that no member of the @entity92 is prepared to come out today to speak for @entity136 ’ energy spokesman @entity137 later appeared on broadcast media later to discuss the issue			0
shadow cabinet minister @entity137 backed mr @entity4 but admitted some of her colleagues were having ‘ jitters ’			1
education spokesman @entity143 , a darling of @entity7 ’s @entity146 rump , dismissed claims he had described mr @entity4 ’s strategy for winning the election as a ‘ total failure ’ as ‘ nonsense ’			1
otherwise , there was an ominous silence from the senior figures in the @entity92			0
the job of leading the fightback was left to @entity0 , still a toxic figure for many voters in @entity159 , and former @entity161 mayor @entity160 , who insisted mr @entity4 would become ‘ the most significant prime minister since @entity163 ’			0
he added : ‘ my one criticism of @entity4 : he was far too nice to all the old @entity146 that he kept on and they ’re now stabbing him in the back			0
they ’re complaining because @entity4 ’s moving us back to being a proper @entity7			0
’ @entity0 , putting on a bizarre @entity169 accent , quoted his newsagent as having said to him of the plotters : ‘ what are all these crazy people doing to our party ? ’ he told @entity29 that the threat to mr @entity4 ’s leadership was ‘ not substantial ’ but was causing ‘ a degree of damage ’			1
‘ as far as i can see , their tendency is towards political suicide , ’ he said			0
‘ there ’s no real substance in what they are saying			0
and the claims that they ’re making , so far as you can identify them , are totally unjustifiable			0
because after four years , @entity4 is a leader of proven courage , high intelligence , he ’s got a great quality of leadership , of great leadership , which is being resilient , calm and defiant			2
’ @entity0 admitted mr @entity4 was portrayed as ‘ remote , cerebral , weird if you like ’ but this was ‘ in total contrast with the man he really is ’			0
a source close to mr @entity4 said : ‘ given the relentless barrage @entity4 has had over the last two or three weeks , it ’s not particularly surprising that his personal ratings are down			0
the truth is that despite a relentless hammering , we are still , on average , ahead in the polls and we are the only party that can reasonably expect to win a majority			0
’ of the claim in the @entity7 - supporting @entity214 newspaper that 20 shadow ministers had turned against the leader , the source added : ‘ i not only fail to recognise it , i specifically deny it			1
