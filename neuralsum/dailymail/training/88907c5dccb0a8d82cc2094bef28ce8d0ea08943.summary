tv star @entity7 , presenter of the tv show @entity9 , had designated today as the day for @entity10 to tell close friends or family members that they are overweight			1
but the move has been widely criticised , with members of the plus - size community saying the scheme amounts to fat - shaming and bullying			1

he wants people to tell friends and family if they are fat ( pictures posed by models ) @entity7 floated the idea of @entity18 they 're @entity6 late last year and even wrote a letter to the health secretary @entity28 about the issue			1
the idea is for people to bring up the issue of obesity with a close friend or family member who is overweight			1
the person would then offer to become an exercise buddy if their friend does decide to try and shift some pounds as a result of the conversation			0
@entity7 claims that the initiative could save thousands of lives			2
@entity7 ( left ) is hoping his warn a friend they 're @entity6 will encourage people to lose weight			1
but @entity47 , the editor slink ( right ) , believes it will have the opposite effect he told @entity51 : ' this day is about saving lives , it is absolutely not about humiliating people			0
' i am proposing to people that they do all of this in a very sensitive manner and only with friends or family that they are extremely close to			1
' it should also only be said to people that you think can handle the information - if you think it will send them the other way , do n't do it			2
' then after you have told them , offer to go to the gym together or take up walking together			0
' i know that the word fat sounds harsh but when you use that word , people take notice - if you wrap the issue up in cotton wool , it does n't work			2
' would you tell a friend they are fat ? but @entity47 , the editor of plus - size fashion magazine @entity78 , disagrees - she thinks @entity7 's campaign is going to have the reverse effect			1
she said : ' recent studies have shown that telling a friend they 're fat , whether you are concerned or otherwise can actually lead to further weight gain			1
' not to mention the way it might change your friendship			0
' i find it amazing that people seem to believe that someone who is fat is unaware of it			2
' she continued : ' we live in a media culture that constantly points out what are perceived to be physical flaws on a daily basis			0
' the issue of our bodies and our relationship with them is incredibly complicated and @entity7 's initiative does n't seem to take any of this into account			2
' if the issue of weight , body image and obesity was this simple , surely we would n't even be having this conversation			0
' @entity47 believes the only way people will reach their goal , is if they want it @entity47 is so disgusted with @entity18 they 're @entity6 that she and a group of fellow plus - size campaigners have launched a counter movement called tell a friend they 're @entity123			1
@entity47 told @entity51 : ' # youarefab is the antidote for people fed up with the long list of detox and diets that are forced upon us in january and a welcome break to the body image negativity that campaigns like @entity7 's can throw up			2
' if someone does want to lose weight , the only way they will reach their goal , is if they want it			0
' if your friend or family member wants your help losing weight , they will ask for it - then is your time to step up			1
' but if that does n't happen , appreciate that their body is their business and use # youarefab to remind each other of the reason you 're friends in the first place			0
' while @entity47 thinks @entity7 's campaign is harmful , he believes # youarefab is equally dangerous and has been tweeting his opposition this afternoon but while @entity47 thinks @entity7 's campaign is harmful , he believes # youarefab is equally dangerous			0
he said : ' the fat acceptance brigade are in my opinion dangerous , because what they are saying is you are ok to be fat and fabulous			0
' that is completely wrong in my opinion			0
' you are basically saying to someone , stay fat and you might die early and that is fine			0
