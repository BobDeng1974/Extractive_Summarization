by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 had @entity2 imagined the perfect way to humiliate @entity4 it would probably have ended with @entity5 running out @entity6 after @entity7 had bullied them into submission			1
you could barely make it up			0
this was as bad as it can get for the ‘ new ’ @entity4 , a sorry rout that will test the resolve of @entity16 , @entity17 and everyone at the @entity19 who have placed so much faith in them to lead the recovery from the horrors of @entity24			1
it was @entity26 who said after the ashes that life may have to get worse before it got better but even he surely could not have envisaged it would get this bad , with one @entity4 batsman after another crashing to sucker punches			1
it is the hope they can not stand			0
and for much of the final morning of this second @entity56 there was genuine hope @entity4 could make up for a mountain of missed opportunities here and pull off one of the great lord ’s run chases			1
we should have known better			0
instead it was @entity7 , something of a mocked figure in @entity2 , who produced what will go down as one of the great spells of @entity71 fast bowling but which , in truth , was a case of collective @entity75 suicide			1
it is one thing being bombarded by @entity78			0
it is quite another to be firstly outbowled by @entity80 and then bounced out in @entity75 conditions on a fifth - day lord ’s pitch by an @entity71 bowler barely touching 83mph			0
yet that was the fate that befell @entity4 after @entity88 and @entity89 had taken them to the brink of lunch without further loss and to a position from which , with 146 needed and six wickets still in hand , they could afford to dream			1
the final ball before the interval changed all that			0
@entity99 , almost in desperation , had persuaded @entity7 to bowl short but 14 came off the last over before lunch and @entity88 had moved to an impressive half - century			0
and again : @entity40 looks to the heavens as the ball goes up into the air and is caught by @entity105 and another one : @entity88 plays a reckless pull shot , again off @entity7 , and is caught by @entity107 leaving a bad taste : @entity88 tries to bite his bat as he walks off and ( right ) a despondent prior then , inexplicably , @entity89 ducked into the final ball and spooned a simple catch			0
suddenly and decisively , everything changed			0
@entity99 stuck with the short - ball policy that had failed @entity4 and one by one @entity75 lemmings fell down the @entity83 ’s slope to oblivion , @entity47 , @entity40 , @entity88 and @entity117 all gifting their wickets to @entity7 and sparking wild @entity71 celebrations			1
so wild , in fact , that @entity7 seemed to have to be pulled back from @entity121 as he walked off while @entity122 screamed in @entity88 ’s face after @entity40 had completed his pair and then postured provocatively when the @entity125 was out			0
time to go ? the under - pressure @entity16 ( second left ) looking pensive on the @entity83 's balcony video i will not walk away - @entity16 it appears that bad feeling continues between these sides — @entity6 and @entity5 face @entity24 @entity133 judicial commissioner @entity132 on tuesday over their confrontation in the first test			1
they are in danger of being suspended for part of the series which is bubbling below the surface despite handshakes at the end			0
those formalities would have been painful for @entity6 , who saw his @entity145 accuser @entity5 take the game away from @entity4 with the bat on sunday and then run him out with a direct hit that completed @entity4 ’s ignominy			1
it was all over by 2.46pm and @entity7 had taken four for nine in 21 balls to finish with career - best figures of seven for 74 and conjure up memories of that day six years ago when he roughed up @entity154			0
this time his burst gave @entity2 only their second win at @entity37 , their first victory overseas in more than three years			1
what a mess it is for @entity4			1
@entity16 , with the full backing of all at the @entity19 , insisted he will carry on but there was unspoken recognition that his position will become untenable if he loses this series and fails to regain form			2
he has three tests to save his captaincy , beginning at the @entity169 on sunday , but how many of the senior players who were supposed to constitute the spine of this transitional side remain is questionable			0
@entity4 will name their third @entity56 squad on tuesday and it will not include prior , even though he had been given the full backing of a captain who wanted him alongside him in this demanding summer			1
prior has simply not looked fit and it was no surprise when he announced he would step away from the team for the rest of the season in an attempt to regain full fitness			0
the time has come for another exciting new face in @entity185 and prior ’s outstanding @entity4 career is almost certainly at an end , even though he clearly does not want to give up on one last crack at the @entity189 just yet			2
@entity117 has virtually been bowling on one leg in this game and , with the chance that @entity6 will be banned later in the series , @entity4 may rest his injured knee in @entity195 and give another chance to @entity197			2
the end is nigh : @entity117 tickles one down the leg side for another limp dismissal down and out : @entity6 ( celntre ) is run out in a farcical manner and @entity4 lose the second test giving it short shrift : @entity88 pulls the ball to the boundary before @entity4 's collapse bounced out : @entity89 was dismissed with the last ball before lunch at @entity37 the long walk : @entity89 trudges off after being dismissed by @entity7 with the last ball before lunch @entity40 , too , is in such wretched batting form that he could miss out in favour of @entity213 , with @entity214 the other candidate to return to the squad			1
clearly , there is some way to go before @entity4 see the light at the end of a very dark tunnel			2
there are many who believe @entity16 should have gone on monday night			2
but the stakes are too high for those who charged him with clearing up the debris of the @entity189 to give up on @entity16 the captain just yet			2
halfway there : @entity88 salutes his 50 on a good morning for @entity4 on the front foot : @entity88 drives the ball to the boundary during a positive morning session for @entity4 going well : @entity88 and @entity89 touch gloves as their partnership reaches 100			2

@entity4 lose by 95 runs against @entity2 in the second @entity56
@entity16 under *extreme* pressure following @entity83 's defeat
@entity47 decides to take a break from *international* *cricket*
