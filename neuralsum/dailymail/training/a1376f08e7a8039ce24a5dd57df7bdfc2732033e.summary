@entity1 striker @entity2 ( right ) missed a chance to score with the goal gaping against @entity16 the @entity25 international reacts to the miss by dropping to his knees as @entity28 the @entity25 international is likely to find himself among the substitutes for the league visit of @entity32 on saturday and @entity0 has no qualms about dropping the 29 - year - old			1
' it 's always hard for the player when he misses this chance , ' he said			2
' it 's okay because he feels that his team - mates , the club and us ( the coaching staff ) support him			2
maybe he will have another opportunity to score ? we have no worries about him because he showed after 90 minutes that he played very good for the team			2
' he knows that there are opportunities for everyone ( to play )			2
we have a lot of games ahead and it 's not a question if you miss a chance whether you play or not play			0
if i decide tomorrow he will go to the bench it will not affect his confidence			0
' the forward is likely to start on the bench on saturday having managed just one league goal this season @entity0 scoffed at suggestions bringing in a psychologist could help @entity2 's current mindset and believes the framework is already in place at the club to support the player			1
' it 's not about psychology , ' the @entity69 added			0
' we see the player and the people and the holistic situation			0
it 's not a case to fix to bring in a psychologist from outside			0
' the better psychology for him is from us ; we are the people with him all of the time			0
in football , sometimes there is a good chance to score , but it 's not a psychology problem			0
