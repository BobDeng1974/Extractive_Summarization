thousands of desperate homeowners with interest - only mortgages could forfeit their children ’s inheritance in a bid to avoid repossession			1
every year , half of those reaching the end of their interest - only home loan find they are unable to pay off their debt			1
@entity14 has become the first bank to announce it will offer lifetime mortgages – a form of equity release – for people in this position			1
the family home is then sold when they die and all or part of the proceeds handed to the bank to pay back the outstanding loan			1
every year half of those reaching the end of their interest - only home loan find they are unable to pay off their debt ( file picture ) but experts warned that such schemes should only be used as a last resort and borrowers should discuss it with their families before effectively selling off the family silver			1
the lifetime loans are designed to help tackle a mortgage timebomb which could see families forced to downsize at the end of their fixed term or face repossession			0
millions took out interest - only mortgages in the 1980s and 1990s			2
monthly repayments are lower than with a traditional mortgage because only the interest , rather than any capital , is being paid off			0
however , that leaves the full loan to be repaid at the end of a typical 25 - year term			2
but around half of the 85,000 loans of this kind which expire every year can not be paid off in full , with the average shortfall in excess of £ 71,000			0
around one in ten of those with such loans failed to plan ahead and save money into a repayment plan			0
others bought an endowment policy , a stockmarket - linked savings plan designed to pay off the loan in full but which , millions have discovered , actually falls well short			2
now those who find themselves with a shortfall could be offered the new deals			0
@entity14 said ‘ a lifetime mortgage is one option we are considering for 2015 ’ in a bid to save families from eviction or being forced to sell their home and downsize to a cheaper property			2
@entity14 has become the first bank to announce it will offer lifetime mortgages – a form of equity release other major banks are also understood to be considering following @entity14 into the equity release market , which is dominated by insurance companies			1
@entity87 , of the @entity88 , admitted that lifetime mortgages can cause tension with family members wanting to keep hold of their inheritance			1
he said : ‘ the ombudsman receives very few complaints about equity release compared to normal mortgages , but those they do receive are mostly from sons and daughters , which is sad but not really surprising			0
‘ if the banks were to become a member of our council then we would require them to follow our strict standards and make sure borrowers have discussed their decision with family members			0
’ @entity108 mortgages will work like equity release , where homeowners use their property like a cash machine by borrowing money against the equity they have built up			0
the difference is that with traditional equity release , borrowers never repay the interest			0
with the bank loans proposed by @entity14 they will pay monthly interest until they die			1
the remaining debt will be deducted from the sale value of the property , leaving their children or grandchildren with a reduced inheritance			2
banks are believed to be considering entering the market after changes to mortgage lending rules made it harder for interest - only borrowers in arrears to take out a new loan banks are believed to be considering entering the market after changes to mortgage lending rules made it harder for interest - only borrowers in arrears to take out a new loan – leaving more at risk of having their home repossessed			1
previously , older workers unable to pay could switch to a repayment mortgage or extend their interest - only term – but many have been shut out by the tougher rules , designed to restrict risky lending , introduced in april			1
@entity149 , a director at mortgage broker @entity150 , said : ‘ @entity108 loans will offer an alternative but you have got to be very , very careful before buying these types of products			0
when you are talking about inheritance intended for family members the subject becomes very emotive			0
