@entity1 justice @entity0 believes @entity3 society is eroding in party because women are using the ' f - word ' and also thinks social media is ' strange			1
' the court 's longest - serving justice - appointed in 1986 - has opened a window into the man behind the robes - a conservative icon who has helped push the ideas of orginalism and textualism into the legal and political mainstream			1
in a recent wide - ranging interview with @entity18 , he offered several insights into his personality - along with a few unorthodox opinions			1
conservative : @entity0 , 77 , has become an icon for conservatives since his appointment in 1986 among his more fascinating comments are : a law using flogging as a criminal punishment would be constitutional , that there is a reasonable legal basis for some discrimination against women - like in combat - and that the @entity34 is still very much at work in the modern world			1
the 77 - year - old @entity0 , raised in @entity37 , @entity38 , by an @entity40 - @entity3 mother and a @entity42 immigrant father , said that he believes @entity3 society is sliding downhill			1
he is perhaps most concerned about the ' coarseness ' that culture has taken on			0
' you ca n’t go to a movie - or watch a television show for that matter - without hearing the constant use of the " f - word " - including , you know , ladies using it ... if you portray it a lot , the society ’s going to become that way			2
it ’s very sad , ' he lamented			0
he also said that while there is no legally - acceptable reason to discriminate against someone on the basis of their race , there can be legal justification to discriminate against someone on account of their sex			2
' if there ’s a reasonable basis for not ­ letting women do something - like going into combat or whatnot ... ' he thinks it could be constitutionally acceptable			1
outspoken : @entity0 offered several opinions during a recent interview , including his belief that there are ' intelligent reasons ' to discriminate against women the newest session of the @entity3 @entity1 opened today with a docket that includes numerous cases that are likely to prove contentious and controversial yet again			1
among the cases selected to be heard this session are : the court has not yet been affected by the government shutdown , though chief justice @entity89 said the justices might be forced to pause their work after october 11			1
' ... there are some intelligent reasons to treat women differently			1
i do n’t think anybody would deny that			0
' he added : ' and there really is no , virtually no , intelligent reason to treat people differently on the basis of their skin			0
' @entity0 was appointed by president @entity104 and joined the bench in 1986 - five years before the first web page was published on the @entity107			1
that revelation might help explain his opinions on social networking			0
' i do n’t know why anyone would like to be ' friended ' on the network			0
i mean , what kind of a narcissistic society is it that ­ people want to put out there ? " this is my life , and this is what i did yesterday ? " i mean … good grief			0
does n’t that strike you as strange ? i think it ’s strange , ' he said			0
@entity0 also added ' suspects ' that he has gay friends - though he insists he does n't ' hate ' gays			2
he said he realizes he could end up on the wrong side of history on the gay rights issue , but he does n't mind - or on other conservative issues he champions			2
' you know , for all i know , 50 years from now i may be the @entity134 of the late - twentieth and early - 21st century , who ’s regarded as : “ he was on the losing side of everything , an old fogey , the old view			0
” and i do n’t care , ' he said			0
@entity0 also volunteered that , as a devout @entity140 , he believes in the @entity34 at that the @entity34 is still at work in the world			1
he said the @entity34 does n't possess people like he is depicted as doing in the @entity144 - he 's ' smarter ' now			2
' what he ’s doing now is getting people not to believe in him or in @entity147			0
he ’s much more successful that way , ' he said			0
when the @entity18 interview expressed surprise at him talking about the @entity34 , @entity0 said he was offended			1
' you travel in circles that are so , so removed from mainstream @entity3 that you are appalled that anybody would believe in the @entity34 ! most of mankind has believed in the @entity34 , for all of history , ' he told @entity18 writer @entity157 .			2

@entity0 , 77 , is a conservative icon on the court and the longest - serving justice - appointed in 1986
in wide - ranging interview he said there can be ' intelligent reasons ' to discriminate against women
says he believes the @entity34 is still at work in the modern world
