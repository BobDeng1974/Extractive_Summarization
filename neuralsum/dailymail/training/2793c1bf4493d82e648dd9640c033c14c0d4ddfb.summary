the pm was at @entity9 's @entity8 where he faced up to one of the sport 's greatest ever bowlers from 22 yards			1
@entity9 's spin king @entity13 , or @entity13 , as he is affectionately known , is the highest wicket - taker in test cricket - but he did n't have it all his own way			1
prime minister @entity5 faces the bowling of @entity9 cricketer @entity13 at @entity19 's @entity8 according to onlookers , mr @entity5 acquitted himself well when he pitted his batting skills against @entity13 , although he later admitted the retired star may have gone a little easy on him			1
mr @entity5 is in @entity19 to attend the @entity23 , and was also given a working over on politics by the sportsman			1
@entity13 suggested the prime minister had been ' misled ' about the latest situation in the war - scarred north of the island			1
mr @entity5 is pressing the @entity9 regime to do more to improve conditions for the minority @entity34 population still suffering the effects of a 26 - year civil war which ended in 2009			1
yesterday he visited families still unable to return to their homes after spending 20 years in refugee camps , in the first visit by a foreign leader to the region since 1948			2
in what he described as ' frank ' talks with president @entity46 the @entity7 said he would press for an international investigation of alleged war crimes if the regime failed to hold a credible one by march			2
agricultural : mr @entity5 tries to loft a @entity13 ball at @entity19 's @entity8 with one foot down the wicket , mr @entity5 hits a ball into the on - side at @entity9 's @entity8 big swing : the prime minister has another swipe at a ball from the @entity9 great they were there to talk about the sportsman 's initiative to bring together youngsters from @entity34 and other communities through cricket as part of post-war reconciliation efforts			1
but asked about the politician 's calls for more action from the government of mr @entity46 - which has been criticised internationally over human rights abuses - @entity13 , a @entity34 , said mr @entity5 was underestimating the improvements already made			1
' i 'm a sportsman and we do n't think about politics , ' he told reporters			2
' my opinion is , there were problems in the last 30 years in those areas			0
mr @entity5 later admitted the retired star may have gone a little easy on him ' nobody could move there			1
in wartime i went with the @entity86 , i saw the place , how it was			0
now i regularly go and i see the place and it is about a 1,000 per cent improvement in facilities			0
' @entity92 is the main game to narrow the bridge between the people			0
but facilities-wise , schools are built , roads are built			0
so many things have happened			0
' thanks to the @entity9 army , they are putting a lot of effort there			2
this country is 20 - odd million people			0
in the north there are only one million people			0
they are getting more attention than the south at the moment			0
' mr @entity5 later tweeted this picture and said : ' he went easy on me - but at least i can say @entity13 did n't get me out ... ' gloves off : @entity5 speaks with @entity9 spin bowler @entity117 ( left ) after trying his hand at batting asked about mr @entity5 's stance , @entity13 said : ' he must have been misled by other people			1
' people speak without going and seeing the things there			0
i go on and off			0
i see from my eyes there is improvement			0
' i ca n't say the prime minister is wrong or not			2
he 's from @entity130 , he has n't seen the site , he has n't gone and visited these places - yesterday only			2
' but other than that , the political side ... basically what we want is food , shelter , education , happiness in the family			0
' mr @entity5 said it was an ' enormous pleasure ' to meet the bowler - who took a record 800 test wickets			1
asked about @entity13 's comments at a press conference , the prime minister said : ' i think he acknowledged that i was right to come and right to visit			1
the @entity7 and @entity13 chat after their face - off at @entity19 's @entity8 mr @entity5 speaking to players at a charity bringing young people from both sides of the @entity9 communities together by playing cricket talking politics : @entity13 suggested the prime minister had been ' misled ' about the latest situation in the war - scarred north of the island ' of course i was told all sorts of things yesterday in the north and there are very strong views in this country , strong differing views on some of the issues			1
' i would say what matters is not everything i was told but what i myself have said , and i think i 've given a fair reflection of some of the things that need to happen in terms of reconciliation , in terms of progress , in terms of human rights , free speech , and i think it 's important to raise these issues			2
' mr @entity5 made clear he backed the march deadline for a new ' credible , transparent and independent ' war crimes probe set by @entity86 human rights chief @entity189 to coincide with her next report on @entity9			1
prime minister @entity5 talks with @entity192 's prime minister dr @entity193 during a working session of the @entity23 @entity5 attends the heads of state meeting at @entity196 , @entity19 @entity197 sits with other heads of state as @entity9 remained defiant against calls for an independent inquiry into alleged atrocities committed during its 27 - year civil war she has warned the country is heading in an increasingly authoritarian direction			1
' if that investigation is not completed by march then i will use our position on the @entity210 to work with the @entity86 human rights commissioner and call for a full , credible and independent international inquiry , ' mr @entity5 told reporters			1
he said he had urged mr @entity46 to act to provide homes for refugees , end the intimidation and beating of journalists and work with newly elected @entity34 regional leaders			2
' i accept it takes time but what matters is being on the right pathway , getting on the right track , ' he said			0
while mr @entity5 has attended , the @entity225 prime minister , @entity226 , and @entity228 prime minister , @entity227 have confirmed they will not attend ' it was a frank meeting			1
of course not everything i said was accepted			0
but i sensed that they do want to make progress on these issues and it will help , frankly , by having international pressure			0
' mr @entity5 has come under fire from campaigners for not joining the leaders of @entity225 , @entity228 and @entity240 in boycotting the summit in protest over human rights			1
but he insisted that his visit justified his judgment that he could achieve more by attending and using the occasion to highlight issues and raise them directly			0
' @entity248 has shown that we will stand up for our values and do all we can to advance them , of course , you can only do that by being here			0
' mr @entity5 had another short meeting before leaving the summit with mr @entity46 at the request of the @entity9 leader - which he hailed as a sign that progress could be made			1
' we discussed more of the issues we discussed yesterday , ' he said			0
' i think that demonstrates really two things : first of all you can have frank and clear conversations but an ongoing dialogue			0
' secondly these issues are not solved by one visit , this is not a flash in the pan , it 's a dialogue , a conversation , pressure that we need to keep up over the longer term and i 'm committed to doing that			2
' he was speaking as he arrived in @entity280 to press the case for @entity248 firms seeking orders for aircraft at its airshow , which starts tomorrow			0
the government is optimistic of securing a deal with the @entity288 to buy @entity290 military aircraft over a @entity292 rival			0

the @entity7 also boasted on @entity304 about his feat of surviving an over from @entity13 with his wicket intact - though he admitted the @entity9 star ' went easy ' on him			2
while he played and missed on a couple of occasions and was forced to defend at least one ball , mr @entity5 struck two of the deliveries well , at one point dispatching @entity13 back over his head .			1

the prime minister was at @entity9 's @entity8
he faced some *vicious* deliveries from spin king @entity13
but mr @entity5 acquitted himself well , according to onlookers
