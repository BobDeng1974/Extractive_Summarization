minutes later , @entity15 and @entity16 were sentenced to six years and eight months in jail for attempting to smuggle £ 1.5million worth of cocaine out of @entity19			1
their families believed they were in @entity41 at the time , working in bars			2
yesterday they learned they had escaped the most severe 15 - year penalty in return for pleading guilty and passing on information about the gang that supplied the drugs			2
the @entity48 understands they could now be released within two - and - a - half years for good behaviour			2
taking into account the time already served , it means they could be freed in early 2016			0
dressed in jeans and a blue t - shirt , @entity23 , 20 , from @entity53 , looked glum as she was led into court clutching two bananas			0
perhaps seeking belated advice on life , @entity16 , 20 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , held a book entitled : @entity62 : ten @entity63			1

@entity16 ’s familiar hairstyle – an oversized bun – was replaced by a more relaxed look , and teamed with a simple green khaki top with black jeans			1
@entity62 is a guide by @entity68 that is said to reveal how to turn difficult and challenging events into something that can ' enrich you '			0
the 62 - year - old @entity103 relationships author 's book reveals 10 steps to help people ' always remain calm and clear ' and have a reliable ' source of confidence and wisdom inside yourself '			0

despite the notoriously difficult conditions at @entity121 jail in @entity19 ’s capital city , she sported a @entity124 manicure , while @entity23 wore pink nail polish with a ‘ nail art ’ pattern			1
the pair , nicknamed the ‘ @entity130 ’ , were led into a makeshift courtroom at @entity132 in @entity78 , at about 10.30am local time			0
judge @entity133 read out the sentence at the end of the 20 - minute hearing , which was closed to the press and public			0
the pair will now apply to serve part of their sentence in the @entity142			0
but according to their lawyers , the process is fraught with ‘ bureaucratic hurdles ’ and they could be released before it is granted			0
a court spokesman said : ‘ @entity16 and @entity15 only spoke to say they agreed with the sentence and ask through a translator if they could serve out their sentences in @entity142			1
it was explained to them that this was something they had to discuss with their lawyer			0
courts process : @entity23 ( centre ) and @entity16 ( left ) arrive for a hearing with a judge in @entity73 on september 24 charges : @entity16 ( left ) and @entity23 ( centre ) listen to a translator at an earlier court hearing in @entity73 in august questioning : the duo were detained on august 6 at @entity30 on suspicion of trying to smuggle cocaine evidence : food packages allegedly containing cocaine which were found in the luggage of @entity16 and @entity23 destination : because @entity16 ( left and right ) and @entity23 have been given a sentence of seven years or less , they are eligible to apply for transfer to @entity142 - although this must be agreed by both governments ‘ they have renounced their right to appeal by agreeing to the sentence			1
’ the pair were then returned to prison , and the cell they share with as many as 40 other women			1
the @entity130 have been sent to the @entity188 prison in @entity189 to begin their sentence , which will last until april 2020			0

’ following their arrest on august 6 , the pair claimed they had been kidnapped by an armed gang and flown to @entity19			1
the women , who did not know each other beforehand , claim they were unwittingly introduced by friends to drugs runners , who threatened their families if they did not agree to smuggle cocaine			1
