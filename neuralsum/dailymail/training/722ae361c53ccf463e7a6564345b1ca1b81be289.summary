by @entity0 ' living in sin ' turns out to be just what 's needed for a happy marriage , according to results of a major study , released last week			1
the @entity7 study upturned previous research - that couples who live together before marriage are more likely to split - with quite the opposite result			1
the study revealed relationships can last eight years longer , if you cohabit before walking down the aisle			2
studies show that living together before marriage can make a relationship last eight years longer this is great news for those considering moving in - but you still need to do a reality check first			1
push emotion to the side , put on your objective hat and see how many of the following you can honestly say ' yes ' to			2
if you ca n't answer ' yes ' to the majority of these questions , i 'd strongly advise you to give it a bit more time - or rethink entirely			0
absolutely must answer yes to : 1			0
do they make you feel good about yourself and are you happier since you met them ? 2			1
are you able to be yourself ? 3			0
have you seen how they behave in all sorts of different situations : day to day , happy events , under pressure at work or from their family or friends ? did they cope well with these crises ? 4			0
are you similar in tastes , views , what you like doing ? 5			0
do you connect on at least three of these crucial connection points : chemistry ( you fancy the pants off each other ) , compatibility ( you share similar backgrounds and interests ) , common goals ( you both want the same things from life ) , pace ( you move at the same speed and are both ' fast ' or ' slow ' people ) and timing ( you 're both ready for commitment ) ? 6			1
do you communicate well ( or at least think you 'll learn to in time ) ? if the majority of your answers are ' no ' @entity0 smells trouble 7			1
do you trust them to be faithful ? if they go out alone or with mates , do they reassure you with details of who they saw , where they went , who they ran into ? 8			0
do you get on with each other 's friends and families ? if neither of you can bear each other 's significant others , it 's not a great sign			0
do you both want the same things from life at around the same time ? do you have similar aspirations and thoughts on marriage , kids and the future ? 10			1
does your gut instinct tell you it 's right ? 11			0
do you like as well as love them ? important to answer yes to : 1			0
are they reliable ? 2			0
do you make decisions together ? 3			1
have you had a few arguments and happy with how you resolved them ? the amount of arguments you 're having is n't as relevant as how well you solve them			1
are you both able to admit when you 're wrong ? 5			1
are they reasonably sorted psychologically ? if they 're excessively jealous , overprotective or battling with substance abuse ( alcohol or drugs ) , solve the problem before moving in			2
are you both happy with the level of intimacy ? make sure sharing secrets , feelings , desires and anxieties is n't lopsided			2
do you laugh together , share the same sense of humour and can laugh at each other and yourselves without getting huffy ? 8			0
are you compatible sexually ? if your libidos do n't match , have you worked out a compromise you 're both happy with ? 9			2
are you both happy with the amount of time spent together and apart ? is there a good balance between ' us ' and ' me ' on both sides ? 10			0
do you trust each other to keep promises ? not just to be faithful but to be trustworthy with money , stick around during bad times and generally do the right thing ? 11			0
can you live with each other 's faults ? everyone has the odd annoying habit but if it really , really irritates you now , it 's only going to get worse once living together			2
are you with each other because you want to be , not because you 're biological clock is ticking or you 're worried no - one else will want you ? were the majority of your answers ' yes ' or ' no ' ? start packing if it 's yes , hold off signing that rental agreement if there were more than a smattering of ' no 's '			2
