by @entity1 reporter published : 19:58 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 04:11 est , 1 august 2013 despite a lack of demand from the @entity7 public for electric cars , the federal government gave a @entity10 company more than $ 100million in taxpayer money to establish a network of car - charging stations that is plagued by multiple problems , a government audit revealed			1
the company is @entity17 - based @entity16 , which recently named @entity19 - one - time chief of staff to former energy secretary @entity20 - to its board of directors			0
' i ’m a political beast , ' @entity16 's then - president , @entity22 , said on a 2007 shareholder conference call			1
' playing the political card is something that when the time is right we ’re going to play very hard			0
' unpopular : @entity7 consumers have made it fairly clear they do n't want electric cars for a variety of reasons in 2009 , it seems the time was right - @entity16 was given a $ 99.8million federal grant to install roughly 15,000 electric vehicle charging stations throughout the country			1
the company also received $ 35 million from the department ’s @entity40 from 2005 to 2011 , “ for two multiyear projects to evaluate and test specific vehicles			2
” all of this comes as president @entity45 has pledged to get one million electric cars on @entity7 roads by 2015 - a lofty goal in a country that has repeatedly shown its disdain for electric vehicles			1
according to the inspector general ’s report , first obtained by @entity55 , ' @entity16 was required to kick in a minimum of 20 percent of cost sharing under the $ 35 million in grants , and under the $ 100 million award , it was to match the taxpayer subsidy			2
but the @entity61 allowed @entity16 to use monthly costs of car owners and other expenses it did not directly incur to leverage the federal funds			0
that meant the company took on little risk in return for its subsidies , the report said			0
' ' although there is no clear legislative history on the meaning behind requiring recipients to provide cost - share , the concept is generally understood to mitigate risk , help leverage federal investments , and ensure that recipients have some ‘ skin in the game ’ in these kinds of transactions , ' the @entity73 report said			0
politics : former @entity16 president @entity89 ' play [ s ] politics hard ' - and was awarded a $ 100million federal contract the company had planned to begin installing charging stations in five metro areas to alleviate one of the biggest issues @entity7 have with electric cars : ' range anxiety ' - the fear amongst consumers that charging electric cars will be too difficult because of a lack of charging stations			1
the goal , the report says , was to instal so many charging stations that they become as common as gas stations			1
however , weak demand for electric cars created a weak demand for charging stations , so the company and the @entity61 opted to spread the stations into five additional cities in order to reach the goal of 15,000 stations			1
the company also started pushing home chargers - both of which are factors that led the @entity73 to conclude that the new plan undermined the goal of alleviating range anxiety in the initial markets			0
' the real problem is the policy approach of the @entity45 administration , ' said @entity131 , of the @entity132			2
' @entity133 and , really @entity16 , were in an impossible situation			0
president @entity45 says , '' there 's going to be 1 million electric cars on the road by 2015 , so here are billions to make it happen			1
'' and then nobody buys the cars			0
supply and demand : government officials agree that there is n't enough demand for electric cars to warrant 15,000 charging stations ' it 's a disastrous domino effect , a complication of a policy that was a bad idea , ' @entity131 said			1
the plan calls for all charging stations to collect data from users			2
but many of the stations were so seldom used that the data they collected was useless in gauging public satisfaction			0
' the lack of analysis by the @entity163 or @entity16 prevented us from determining whether the reasoning behind these changes was sound and in the best interest of @entity7 taxpayers , ' the @entity73 wrote .			0

' i *'m* a political beast . ' that 's what the former president of a company with ties to the @entity175 told shareholders before the federal government gave the company $ 100million to build a network charging stations for electric cars
president @entity45 has pledged to get one million electric cars on @entity7 roads by 2015
