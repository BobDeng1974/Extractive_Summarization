a monster storm on the sun 's surface has unleashed a solar flare in the direction of @entity5 - and there could be more to come			1
the event temporarily blacked out a few radio communication systems before weakening			1
the storm came from a large group of sunspots and hit @entity5 between 10 am and 11 am edt ( 2pm and 3pm bst ) yesterday			1
this image shows extreme ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 131 angstroms , which highlights the intense heat of a solar flare ' it would seem to be just a matter of time before another strong explosion occurs , ' said @entity30 's @entity29 @entity32 forecaster @entity31 , meanwhile , said the flare affected radio that uses part of the upper atmosphere			1
that includes some but not all radar and plane systems as well as amateur radio			0
solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			0
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity5 ’s magnetic field			2
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			0
mr @entity31 said the storm briefly was rated as strong for affecting @entity5 radio systems but then dropped to minor levels			1
the event followed months of near - silent activity on the sun before the huge flare erupted from a sunspot 14 times bigger than @entity5			1
a spokesperson for the @entity69 told @entity70 it may be the biggest sunspot for 25 years			1
but they said in the @entity74 there had been ' no reports of any disruption at all			0
there may have been short periods of outage in radio communication but nothing has been repotred as causing problems			1
' flares are massive explosions on the @entity86 associated with sunspots			0
magnetic fields in sunspots can store vast amounts of energy , but looping magnetic field lines can get tangled up and snap , releasing their energy as explosions called flares			0
@entity95 is 14 times larger than @entity5 and almost as big as @entity96			1
the @entity69 told @entity70 it might be the largest sunspot in 25 years			1
it is so big that it can be seen in images of the sun from @entity5 's surface ( shown in this image from pilot @entity103 ) the light area in the centre of this image is the largest sunspot in this 11 - year solar cycle , says the @entity69 , and it may also have been the largest sunspot for 25 years yesterday 's flare was an @entity14 , which is a million times the combined yield of every single nuclear weapon on @entity5			1
' the sun erupted with another significant flare today , peaking at 10:28 a.m. edt on oct. 22 , 2014 , ' revealed @entity21			2
' @entity21 ’s @entity20 captured images of the event , which occurred in the lower half of the sun. ' this flare is classified as an @entity14 flare			2
' x-class flares denote the most extreme flares			0
' this is the third substantial flare from the same region of the sun since oct. 19			2
' dr @entity122 of @entity21 ’s @entity123 added : ‘ it continues to grow in size and complexity			0
' the sunspot group - @entity127 2192 - has doubled in size to become one of the biggest groups in years , and has been described by astronomy experts as ‘ menacing ’			2
up close : @entity132 taken by @entity133 on october 21 , 2014 from @entity134 , @entity135 solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation			2
@entity21 says , ‘ harmful radiation from a flare can not pass through @entity5 ’s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground , but when intense enough - they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where @entity147 and communications signals travel			1
’ an @entity20 / @entity149 view of the visible sun showing the largest sunspot of solar cycle 24 , @entity95 - which is approaching the size of @entity5			1
according to experts at @entity157 , ' as of oct. 22 , 2014 ( 11 @entity158 ) the region ’s trailing spots have an area of @entity160 or millionths of a visible solar hemisphere			0
' the largest up until now had been ar11967 on feb. 5 , 2014 , measuring 1580 mh			0
@entity165 is a standard measure used by astronomers for area			0
' just to provide some scale , the surface area of @entity5 is 169 mh - this means that @entity172 is 14 times larger than the surface area of @entity5			1
' according to @entity21 's @entity20 ( @entity20 ) team a single , dynamic active region unleashed over half a dozen solar flares in about 24 hours from 25 to 26 august			2
the two larger flares were m - class ( moderate ) flares and the others were smaller flares			0
this animation shows an ejection associated with the flares			0

solar radiation knocked out some radio communication on @entity5 yesterday
it came from a giant sunspot seen on the surface of the sun recently
@entity95 is 14 times larger than @entity5 and almost as big as @entity96
the @entity69 tells @entity70 it might be the largest sunspot in 25 years
it is so big that it can be seen in images of the sun from @entity5 's surface
this particular flare from the sunspot was brief but strong
it follows three days of *severe* storms on the sun
' it would seem to be just a matter of time before another strong explosion occurs , ' said @entity212 's @entity29
