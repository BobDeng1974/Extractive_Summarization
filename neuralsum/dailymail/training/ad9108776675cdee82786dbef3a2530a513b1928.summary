by @entity0 published : 13:06 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 03:17 est , 6 december 2012 have you ever wondered what thinking about nothing looks like ? no ? then that 's why you 're probably not an artist			0
however , @entity7 , who really is an artist - and one of some renown - did wonder how his empty mind might appear if made corporeal			2
to find out he hooked himself up to an electroencephalograph scanner connected to a robot carving machine , then tried not to think			1
what thinking about nothing looks like : art and technology group @entity17 hooked up celebrated sculptor @entity7 to an @entity20 scanner connected to a robot sculpting machine and got this the result was this void space in the middle of a block of @entity28 stone , now on display at @entity31 's @entity30			1
the shape carved out from the lump of rock is pictured below			0
the project was the idea of art and technology group @entity17 , whose members developed bespoke software to translate @entity7 's brainwaves into 3d shape information			1
this data was translated into instructions for a manufacturing robot , which carved out the shapes from the interior of a block of stone to create the curious sculpture			0
the project utilised a relational database comprising of several hundred digital @entity20 recordings from participants who have donated their brainwaves from the @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 these @entity60 were recorded while the participants perceived 3 - dimensional depth information within autostereograms and were instrumental in the translation of @entity7 's @entity20 into instructions for the manufacturing robot to create the sculpture , @entity17 said			1
strange : the shape of the space carved out from inside the stone as well as the sculptural representation of @entity7 thinking about nothing , exhibits will include a film of the carving of the stone as well as other documentation of the development and delivery of the work			2
the gallery said : ' a timely addition and challenge to the present climate of technological evolution and increasing cybernetic augmentation , @entity80 offers an alternative model for a creative , non-invasive interface between body , mind and machine			0
' the project was funded by @entity92 and @entity93 .			0

sculpture is the result of hooking up @entity7 's brain to an @entity20 scanner connected to a robot carving machine
it is on display at @entity31 's @entity103 until *february*
