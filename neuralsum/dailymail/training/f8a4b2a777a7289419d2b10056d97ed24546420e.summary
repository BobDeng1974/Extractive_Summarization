she 's the only player in @entity3 ’s @entity2 - winning women ’s rugby team to have had a baby – but do n’t think it ’s put her at any disadvantage			1
for @entity7 says her traumatic experience of childbirth has made her even tougher on the pitch			2
and the 31 - year - old said she hoped her experience of juggling professional sport and childcare , as well as a job as a pe teacher , would inspire other women with families			1
@entity7 , 31 , pictured here with her two - year - old daughter @entity20 , is the only mother in the @entity3 women 's rugby team , but says she hopes her experience of juggling work , professional sport and motherhood will inspire other women ‘ after you ’ve gone through childbirth , you do n’t fear pain anymore , ’ she told the @entity26			1
‘ i do n’t think anything in rugby is going to be as painful as childbirth			0
‘ it ’s worth it in the end			0
ask any mother and it ’s worth it to have that little baby in your arms			2
‘ the experience has made me live for the moment – i want to win every game			0
but at the end of the day i still have my family to go home to			0
that ’s my number one priority			0
‘ that ’s what ’s so great about having a family – whatever ’s happening in your job or your rugby or your career , they ’re there for you and you ca n’t be sad in front of your children , they just make you happy			2
’ mrs @entity7 was diagnosed with pre- eclampsia – a condition which can prove fatal for the mother and unborn child – meaning an emergency caesarean was the only option			1
but despite the toll on her body , she returned to the rough and tumble of the pitch in her position of hooker after only four months			2
mrs @entity7 , from @entity75 , is pictured being tackled in the @entity2 semi-final against @entity77			1
the @entity3 team took the title for the first time in 20 years she said : ‘ having people tackling you and having impact on the area where you ’ve had the c - section was quite scary , but i had a couple of mates at my club in @entity89 who tackled me in the corner to see if it was n’t too bad			1
‘ the best thing to do is to get back in the game and give it a shot and see what happens			0
’ like any high - powered woman , @entity7 knew having a baby might mean the end of her career , but her determination to get her fitness back meant she won her place back almost immediately			1
now mrs @entity7 , from @entity105 in @entity75 , takes two - year - old daughter @entity20 with her on tour			1
the rugby player - who is also a pe teacher - takes her daughter with her on tour and says she loves it with the help of her husband @entity112 , 35 , an @entity113 rugby coach , and mother @entity114 , 59 , a caterer , she was able to juggle looking after @entity20 with her job and training			1
@entity7 says the battle wounds she sustains during rugby matches are nothing compared to childbirth ‘ having a family was important to me , ’ she added			2
‘ it ’s not easy , you need a massive support network behind you , but you can do it – women do n’t have to stop their career or sport once they ’ve had their baby			1
’ women rugby players , in contrast to their male counterparts , receive no sponsorship to play			1
as a result all members of the women ’s team have day jobs – including a vet , lifeguard , plumber and several teachers – and they get reimbursed for the days they have taken off work as payment			2
yesterday , as the team was welcomed home from the competition in @entity149 by cheering crowds at @entity151 , @entity20 was allowed to get her hands on the cup			2
‘ she loved it , ’ mrs @entity7 said			1
‘ it was a great privilege for us to win this year , never mind have my daughter there			0
it ’s an experience not many people get to share with their kids			0
‘ she ’s really sporty , and she ’s always running and jumping off things			0
so hopefully she ’ll get into a sport when she ’s older			0
’ sunday ’s victory was the first time the @entity3 women ’s rugby team have won a @entity2 in 20 years , with the last win in @entity168 in 1994			1
it marks a high point in a long battle for the women , who made it through to the finals in 2002 , 2006 and 2010 but missed out each time at the last hurdle			0
@entity7 said she hoped sunday ’s victory would inspire other women to take up rugby , which is still seen as a men ’s sport by many			1
she added : ‘ when we first started playing and first started getting media coverage there were a few negative comments but we just answer it by saying , “ come and watch our game ”			0
‘ since people have been able to watch us on tv , it ’s changed people ’s opinions			0
what they see is a good game of rugby			0
