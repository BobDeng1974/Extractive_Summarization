by @entity0 published : 14:57 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 01:35 est , 4 september 2013 @entity1 , 14 , continued playing rugby for 25 minutes despite his injury a schoolboy rugby player died from second impact syndrome after playing rugby for 25 minutes and colliding with another player , an inquest has heard			1
@entity1 , 14 , collapsed on the pitch at @entity9 , @entity10 , in @entity11 , in january 2011 and died in hospital from head injuries			1
coroner @entity14 told an inquest in @entity16 she believed the teenager had sustained concussion during a heavy collision with another player at the start of the second half but , despite his injury , had played on for a further 25 minutes			1
' i am satisfied that he sustained concussion in the first four minutes of the second half			1
unfortunately neither the team coach or the referee were made aware of his neurological complaints and he continued to play , ' ms @entity14 said			1
@entity1 , who was playing for @entity29 , was involved in two other clashes during the game with @entity32 at his school grounds			1
in the final minutes he fell to the ground unconscious and , despite frantic efforts by a doctor who had been spectating and medics at the @entity38 , he never recovered			1
the coroner added : ' i accept the consensus opinion that the features of this death are typical of second impact syndrome which occurs when two concussive - type injuries are sustained in a short space of time			1
it is exceptionally rare but can affect young people between 14 and 18 whilst engaged in sporting activity			2
' this is the first recorded death of its kind in @entity11 and most probably the first in the @entity54			1
medical science is not able to ascertain why an individual can succumb to this exceedingly rare syndrome			2
' there is some evidence that children are more susceptible to second impact syndrome than adults because their brains can not recover as well from a minor knock			2
devastated : mother @entity65 , pictured with father @entity66 , said @entity1 had slept in his rugby kit the coroner said she would present her findings to the head of @entity72 rugby and @entity11 ’s @entity73 to highlight the dangers of second impact syndrome and raise awareness about concussion management			1
' i think everybody could learn from this , ' she added			2
outside the court , the schoolboy ’s parents said they would fight for the introduction of new legislation to protect young people engaged in contact sports			2
his father , @entity66 , said : ' we welcome the coroner ’s findings and the recognition that there was a concussion early in the second half and he played a full half with concussion			1
devastated : @entity65 the mother of schoolboy @entity99 is comforted after speaking to the media in @entity16 ' obviously it has been highlighted about education - it is about getting the message out to the schools			0
we had a policy in @entity107 , a template for all of this , that can be put in place tomorrow if they wanted			0
' i would love to fight for @entity113 because why should children in the @entity54 not have the rights like in @entity107			0
' the family have consistently argued that @entity1 should have been taken off the pitch earlier and believe if modern guidelines on concussion management had been put in place their son would still be alive			1
mr @entity1 said he hoped something positive could come out of the tragedy			1
he added : ' we lost @entity99			0
there has to be something good come of this			0
just to make sure no other family has to go through this			2
it is so easily prevented			0
again we go back to education and all the facts being presented to parents so they are aware			0
' there were harrowing scenes inside @entity16 ’s @entity136 when video footage of the match was played			0
in it , @entity1 could clearly be seen clutching his head on several occasions			1
the schoolboy ’s mother , @entity65 who had been watching from the sidelines as her son collapsed , wept uncontrollably while other friends and relatives clung to each other for support and wiped away tears			0
afterwards mrs @entity65 recalled how @entity1 had slept in his rugby kit and had not wanted to let team mates or his school down during the crucial match			1
she said the coroner ’s findings provided little comfort			2
' i do n’t have my son back			0
i have an image of my 14 - year - old son in his rugby kit the night before			0
he slept in his rugby kit because he did n’t want to forget anything and he did n’t want to let anybody down			0
he did not want to let anybody down during that match , ' she said			0
' he was the most loveable , loving , likeable , honest kid			0
he was just a 14 - year - old kid who is missed every second of every day			0
he was a very loyal boy , outspoken but a good kid , a great son and a fantastic brother			0
' the coroner described the video images as ' extremely useful ' and said they were ' better than a witness statement ' because they could not be disputed			2
the inquest previously heard how @entity1 had appeared dazed and confused towards the end of the game			1
a team mate said he had not been aware of the score that his team was winning			0
it was also claimed that after one collision @entity1 had to be helped up by the team coach			1
cause of death was officially recorded as cerebral oedema and subdural haemorrhage associated with second impact syndrome .			0

@entity1 died in @entity10 , @entity11 , in january 2011
coroner @entity14 said she believed the teenager had concussion following a collision with another player
