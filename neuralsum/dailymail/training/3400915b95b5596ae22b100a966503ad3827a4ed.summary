by @entity0 published : 02:57 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 10:05 est , 26 january 2013 the gay marriage @entity2 was launched yesterday amid fears that it fails to protect registrars , hospital chaplains and even teachers from being sued if they reject same - sex unions			1
@entity10 is pressing ahead with the draft law despite fierce opposition from within his own ranks			1
several cabinet ministers have already indicated they would vote against the @entity15 and defence secretary @entity16 has raised concerns about the ‘ robustness ’ of protection for faiths			1
fears : a @entity23 source fears that teachers could face the sack if they make a stand against gay marriage despite reassurances from @entity29 that they would not be punished for their views uncertain : decisions on whether to sack teachers for their views on gay marriage could be down to the @entity35 and not the government according to a @entity23 source some senior @entity37 say the prime minister is in danger of splitting the party over the @entity2 just days after he managed to unite it by announcing a referendum on @entity42			1
under the draft law published yesterday , gay couples will have the right to marry in civil or religious ceremonies if the faith in question chooses to carry it out			1
culture secretary @entity50 , who is also minister for equalities , said it would ensure ‘ equal and fair ’ treatment for gay couples			1
she said : ‘ marriage is a hugely important institution in this country – one which has changed throughout our history , and continues to change			0
the values of marriage bind families and communities together			0
‘ in opening up marriage to same - sex couples we will further strengthen the importance of marriage in our society			1
this @entity2 protects and promotes religious freedom , so all religious organisations can act according to their doctrines and beliefs			1
’ @entity75 mps who oppose the law say there is no guarantee that faith groups and public sector workers could not be sued under equalities legislation – and be defeated in the @entity35			2
some argue that teachers and other staff who do not support gay marriage could be punished for failing to promote it			2
a @entity23 source claimed it may be difficult to prevent those with traditional views being dismissed			0
support : education secretary @entity29 , left , is in favour of the gay marriage bill fast tracked by @entity10 , right , but strongly supports the right of teachers to disagree the measures will also allow civil partners to convert their partnership into a marriage			1
there is also special protection for the @entity102 and @entity103 , making it illegal for their clergy to carry out gay weddings			2
mrs @entity50 said if the @entity109 change their stance at a later date , the law can be amended			2
the cost of the legislation to the public sector would be £ 3.3million to £ 4.7million			0
mps will get a chance to debate the @entity2 next month and it is likely to be a combative session			0
@entity10 has attempted to head off a rebellion by giving conservative mps a free vote , but @entity122 and the @entity123 are likely to team up with the government in favour			1
@entity75 mp @entity126 argued that unlike other issues of conscience such as the @entity15 and the @entity130 and @entity131 , the detail would not be examined in the @entity132 because of the swift timetable for getting it through			0
instead it will be scrutinised by a parliamentary committee			0
he said : ‘ those bills on important issues of conscience were fully scrutinised on the floor of the @entity142 but they want to rush this one through , which will do nothing to allay concerns about the protection of religious groups , schoolteachers , health workers and other public sector workers			2
’ @entity151 mp said the @entity15 ‘ does not provide adequate protection for freedom of conscience ’ : ‘ challenges could be made in the @entity157 courts which would run a coach and horses through these so - called protections and we have already seen religious freedoms are not protected by the @entity35			2
’ archbishop @entity163 , vice president of the @entity164 , said : ‘ alongside many people of all faiths and none we will be vigorously opposing the @entity2			0
’ right and wrong : mr @entity10 with his mother @entity168 even @entity10 ’s mother is not convinced about the merits of his gay marriage @entity172 , 78 , was asked at a lunch why her son was pressing head with the legislation which had alienated many grassroots @entity37 and said : ‘ i know , @entity10 just wo n’t be told ’			1
the policy was also heavily criticised by local activists and some @entity75 mps , but mr @entity10 sees it as central to his modernisation drive			1
he told @entity180 : ‘ i do n’t support gay marriage in spite of being a conservative			2
i support gay marriage because i am a conservative			0
’ mrs @entity172 , 78 , is a retired magistrate who once said her work had helped her to teach her son about right and wrong			0
a biography of the prime minister described the family as ‘ old fashioned ’ and said his stockbroker father @entity193 was a churchwarden and his mother helped arrange the flowers			0
mrs @entity172 , who was born @entity196 , previously said that mr @entity10 was never short of an opinion , even when he was only five			1
in an interview during the 2010 election campaign she said that friends would beg for him to ‘ shut up ’			0
she added : ‘ he always had something to say ’			0
mr @entity10 said of her : ‘ my mother was a mum at home as it were , but she was a magistrate in the local courts in @entity206 , and i always admired her sort of sense of public service and responsibility and putting something back			1
