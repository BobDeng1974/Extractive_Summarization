his mother @entity10 , who is not using her surname to protect her son , has revealed that she has only now discovered that her boy 's violent behavior stems from the fact that he suffers fetal alcohol syndrome - an extremely rare condition which affects only one - percent of the population			1

' i had my thumb over the wound			0
it was just a little thumb - sized wound			2
' the case stunned the nation and her son became one of the youngest ever defendants charged with murder in @entity127			0

but @entity10 never gave up on him			0
' he ’s my child , ' she said she would tell herself			0
' even now , that ’s not an option			0
