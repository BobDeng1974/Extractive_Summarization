i eat a lot of ice cream , chocolate , and cookies , and i drink ros√© champagne			0
' the @entity71 , who suffers from incontinentia pigmenti , may take pains to look like the models gracing @entity9 's catalogs , but her dual role as top creative executive and president is not to be snuffed at			1
@entity80 , @entity9 ceo @entity81 's former head of men 's wear at @entity83 , told @entity22 : ' she looks like a model , and then she talks like the best salesperson you ever met			1
i think she 's the most talented person [ mr @entity81 ] has ever worked with in design			0
@entity89 above the rest : @entity9 's creative director and president , @entity3 ( far left ) and girlfriend @entity91 ( left ) visit the @entity94 with stylist @entity95 ms @entity3 ' move to the top has not been easy ; during her childhood she was subjected to constant bullying after her genetic disorder , incontinentia pigmenti , led to scarred skin , patchy hair , and lost teeth - requiring dentures			1
she explained : ' it 's amazing how cruel kids can be and superjudgmental and really just downright mean			0
' finding refuge in art , ms @entity3 , who is dating jewelry designer @entity91 , said : ' i searched for ways to make things more beautiful and surrounded myself with beautiful things because i did n't feel that in myself			0
new love : ms @entity91 ( left ) and ms @entity3 ( right ) began dating last year , after the @entity9 boss split from her husband of nine years ' i felt a huge drive to make clothes that everybody could have because i felt ostracized by that world of beauty and fashion			1
' ms @entity3 , who started at @entity9 as a 21 - year - old ' assistant to an assistant , ' also revealed how she landed her current role , 20 years later in 2010			1
when mr @entity81 arrived at @entity9 in 2003 from @entity83 , the company was in financial distress			1
on his first day at the company , he requested that every employee re-interview for their jobs - including ms @entity3 , who was asked to run through the women 's collection in front of a roomful of 50 people			1
mr @entity81 asked her thoughts on the three pairs of skinny stretch pants she was presenting			0
' at that point i was like , " i have to be honest , " ' recalled ms @entity3			0
' i ca n't lie to him because this is sort of a do - or - die situation			1
' she was honest , telling him that she did n't like much of the collection , and explained what she would like to change			0
' i did n't know if i was going to be fired , ' she said			0

and i was like , " is that good , is that bad ? i do n't know			0
" ' she kept her job , even though many did not			2
' honestly , i think it was because i did n't bullshit him , ' ms @entity3 explained			0
' his bullshit - dar is insane			2

a former employee explained : ' if @entity3 was n't there , @entity9 would be really good , but it would not be great			1
