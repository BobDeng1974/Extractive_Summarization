on the road that runs adjacent to the @entity7 do @entity2 lake directly in front of @entity5 ’s @entity4 , a familiar ritual has been played out every single match day of this @entity9			2
in the hours before kick - off , boys from the nearby slum houses have emerged to play football in the road			1
the best player has to play with one shoe off			0
nearby , those not old enough to join in race up and down on bicycles with no tyres on			0
part of it is exhibitionism			0
the thousands of visitors pouring round the lake on the way to the stadium provided a ready - made audience			2
largely , though , these games simply represented a desperate desire to be involved in a tournament that never really belonged to them			0
for these kids have had no greater chance of watching a game taking place on their doorstep than they had of being picked to wear the famous yellow and green			0
this was the @entity9 for them and millions like them			0
and now even that is over			0
there are two ways to view the disaster that befell @entity64 ’s @entity39 team in @entity65 on tuesday night			1
it can be seen as a sporting disappointment placed in proper context or as a symbolic humiliation of a population fast losing ways in which it can feel proud			1
in a bar on @entity76 ’s fashionable @entity75 on tuesday night — it cost £ 30 for beer , fried food and a seat in front of a tv — the patrons had forgotten about the game by the time the musicians struck up in an awning outside afterwards			0
just a few miles away , though , a gang was breaking into a bus depot to set fire to a fleet of vehicles			0
elsewhere in @entity76 , electrical shops were looted			0
sirens wailed through the night , at times masking the fireworks that — on this occasion — symbolised desolation rather than celebration			0
in @entity99 , on the north - east coast , mounted police broke up fights in the @entity102 while in @entity104 gangs of youths attacked and robbed tourists outside the @entity107			1
spelling it out : @entity39 was rocked by a quite astonishing result final insult : @entity45 fans in @entity111 set fire to a @entity39 flag after they watched the game in @entity116 the last time @entity39 were humiliated on home soil at a @entity9 — a comparatively tame 2 - 1 defeat by @entity119 in 1950 — they changed their kit as part of turning over a new leaf			1
they ditched their white shirts and chose the now famous yellow jerseys instead			0
so where now ? back to white or maybe black to show they are in mourning ? like any social or civil unrest , the root causes run deep			1
this is n’t really about football			1
but with so much public money being ploughed into this bloated , middle class , corporate event , it was always likely that the fall - out would be grim if things went wrong on the field			1
in the run - up to a tournament that millions in @entity39 simply did not want , the public seemed to cut an unspoken deal with the authorities and with @entity102			1
if @entity39 give us what we want on the pitch , we will tolerate this tournament			1
if they do n’t , we will have our say			2
nobody , of course , thought for one moment that it would end like this			1
defeat is one thing , humiliation quite another			1
as the respected veteran journalist @entity159 , from @entity160 , told the @entity161 : ‘ there will be anger			0
there is anger already but we do n’t know the full reaction			2
on tv they dissected the performance of @entity64 ’s team all morning			0
reaction in the newspapers was colourful			0
‘ @entity174 , @entity175 , ’ declared one			0
another merely congratulated the team who lost the 1950 @entity9 final to @entity119 as being better than the current @entity180 that is froth , of course			0
as @entity159 said , the chances are that the real , devastating impact of this sporting catastrophe will actually be played out in the coming days and weeks and nobody knows yet quite how bad it will be.forget the tv pictures of the pretty girls crying in the stands as @entity45 humiliated @entity39 in the @entity190			1
their pain is unlikely to have lingered much longer than it took to take a taxi home to the suburbs			0
the real anguish here will be felt by those at the other end of the lop - sided socio - economic pyramid			1
it will be felt by those still waiting for proper roads in @entity204 , a subway completion in @entity5 ( work began in 2001 ) and a proper drainage system in @entity99			2
fans ' fury : angry @entity39 supporters torched a bus in @entity76 after their team 's shambolic show the morning after the night before : torched buses sit ruined in a depot in the wake of defeat they say that sport imitates life but not in @entity39 it does n’t			1
here , it only serves to highlight the differences between one kind of life and another			0
only two outfield players in @entity64 ’s squad earn their living in the @entity39 league			2
when you consider that every member of the great @entity39 teams of the 1962 and 1970 @entity233 played in @entity234 then the disconnect felt by the public is clear			1
these days , @entity39 ’s national league is a debt - ridden , under - performing shambles			1
top clubs such as @entity239 and @entity240 are millions of pounds in debt			0
others failed to pay player wages last season			0
it ’s no surprise then that @entity39 ’s brightest young players are hauled off to talent factories in @entity248 and @entity249 before being recycled - — at huge personal gain — into the @entity252 leagues when they are good enough			1
the players of the national team could n’t be further removed from those street kids in @entity5 if they tried and the irony of this defeat by @entity45 is that a @entity252 game that has for so long been creaming off @entity39 ’s talent has now returned to kick sand in its face on its own shores and in front of its own disintegrating public			1
the public in @entity39 can not soothe themselves — as we do in @entity268 and @entity269 and @entity270 — with the thought of the recommencing of successful domestic leagues and new forays in to the @entity275			1
these last few weeks represented the last chance for the @entity39 to see their own players for a while			2
under control : police officers take actions to keep order after the match in @entity65 on the march : @entity39 police officers are watchful following unrest in @entity65 at times it has been tempting to believe that the @entity39 lower classes have taken something from this tournament			1
the yellow and green bunting strung across the pot - holed roads of the favelas appeared to indicate patriotism			2
on the fringes of the beach - front @entity298 in @entity300 , @entity99 and @entity204 , meanwhile , locals have partied enthusiastically , drinking cheap weak beer dispensed by street hawkers and eating food grilled on makeshift barbecues			1
on every street corner , though , have stood the @entity39 riot police , a constant reminder of just what might happen			1
the @entity39 authorities are perhaps fortunate that the third - placed game their team play on saturday takes place in @entity313			1
a new town built in 1960 , the capital — with its wide roads and @entity318 - style grid system — is as easy to police as anywhere			2
the government do face an election in october , though , and it is hard to believe the ramifications of a @entity9 that will now be remembered for only one game will not be felt at the polls			0
back in 1950 , @entity39 sank under the weight of that loss to @entity119 at their own maracana			2
the @entity330 ( the @entity331 ) hit like a hammer			0
sixty - four years on , there is no reason to suspect the affect will be any different			2
‘ i played for 19 years , ’ said @entity335 , a member of the 1950 @entity39 team			2
‘ i won a few titles and yet now i ’m just remembered as a loser			0

@entity39 's humiliation can be seen as a sporting disappointment or as a symbolic humiliation of a population fast losing ways in which it can feel proud
in @entity99 mounted police broke up fights in the @entity102 while in @entity104 gangs of youths attacked and robbed tourists outside the @entity107
