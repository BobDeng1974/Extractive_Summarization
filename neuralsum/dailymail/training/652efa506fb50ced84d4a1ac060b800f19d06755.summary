by @entity0 a new drug which boosts the immune system could provide a breakthrough in the treatment of obesity and related illnesses a new drug which boosts the body 's immune system could provide a breakthrough in the treatment of illnesses linked to obesity			2
spiraling obesity rates have resulted in alarming rates of diabetes , heart disease and cancer			1
scientists are hopeful that in the next two years a new jab could be available to tackle obesity - and in turn slash the associated health risks			2
a new study carried out at @entity23 and the @entity24 in the @entity25 has identified a new hormone , irisin , which increases in the body during exercise , boosting energy and controlling blood glucose levels			1
researcher professor @entity31 said activating the body 's immune system could treat obesity and diabetes			2
he told the @entity35 : ' this research reveals an exciting new class of potential treatments that could be used for obesity - related disorders			0
' the body produces ' healthy ' brown fat , which is turned on or activated when a person is cold to help maintain body heat by burning stored calories			1
studies have found exercise can stimulate hormones that activate brown fat			1
the new research focused on a protein found to stimulate the secretion of the hormone irisin			0
prof @entity31 said harnessing irisin could help scientists develop better therapies for any illness that can be controlled by exercise			1
the breakthrough marks an important first step in understanding the biological mechanisms that translate physical exercise into beneficial changes throughout the body , both in healthy people and in preventing or treating disease			1
experiments found irisin helps convert ' bad ' white fat - which accumulates around a person 's middle - into ' healthy ' brown fat , which increases energy expenditure and improves resistance to obesity linked diabetes			1
prof @entity31 said : ' there has been a feeling in the field that exercise ‘ talks to ’ various tissues in the body			0
but the question has been , how ? ' the report said the irisin hormone has direct and ' powerful effects ' on adipose or fatty tissue - deposits of white fat that store excess calories , which contribute to obesity			1
when irisin levels rise during exercise - or when injected directly into mice - it switches on genes that convert white fat into brown fat			1
in the wake of findings by @entity96 and others , there has been a surge of interest in the therapeutic possibilities of increasing brown fat in adults			2
along with stimulating brown fat development , irisin was shown to improve glucose tolerance , a key measure of metabolic health , in mice fed a high fat diet			1
prof @entity31 warned the discovery will not allow people to skip the gym and build muscles by taking irisin supplements , because the hormone does not appear to make muscles stronger			0
the study showed irisin levels increase as a result of repeated bouts of prolonged exercise , but not during short - term muscle activity			2
scientists from @entity23 and the @entity24 say a new hormone identified during their study could prove the breakthrough in the treatment of conditions including diabetes to test whether increasing irisin alone could mimic exercise benefits , the scientists injected modest amounts into sedentary mice that were obese and pre-diabetic			1
with just 10 days of treatment , the mice had better control of blood sugar and insulin levels - in effect , preventing the onset of diabetes - and lost a small amount of weight			0
although the weight loss was small , prof @entity31 said the hormone may have a greater effect when given for longer periods			0
prof @entity31 said : ' whether longer treatments with irisin and / or higher doses would cause more weight loss remains to be determined			0
' the worldwide , explosive increase in obesity and diabetes renders attractive the therapeutic potential of irisin in these and related disorders			0
' he added : ' another potentially important aspect of this work relates to other beneficial effects of exercise , especially in some diseases for which no effective treatments exist			0
' the clinical data linking exercise with health benefits in many other diseases suggests that irisin could also have significant effects in these disorders			0
' his colleague dr @entity171 said : ' it is s exciting to find a natural substance connected to exercise that has such clear therapeutic potential			0
' prof @entity31 said it should be possible to move an irisin - based drug rapidly into clinical testing , possibly within two years , because it is a natural substance that is identical in mice and humans			0

study by scientists in the @entity25 identified new hormone - irisin , which increases in the body during exercise
harnessing irisin could help scientists develop better therapies for diabetes , heart disease and other illnesses which can be controlled through exercise
hormone converts ' bad ' white fat - stores of excess calories - into ' healthy ' brown fat , which increases energy expenditure
