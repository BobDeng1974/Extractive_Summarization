@entity0 responded strongly after again hitting a stumbling block on his nemesis dive to qualify in first place in defence of his @entity6 10 metres platform title in @entity7 on saturday			1
the 20 - year - old has had trouble when it comes to the back two - and - a - half somersault with two - and - a - half twists which he describes as his ' demon ' and scored just 37.80 , after landing with quite a splash			1

he scored 83.20 with his third dive - an inward 3 1/2 somersault - to move up to eighth place at the halfway point before two scores over 100			2
his sensational forward 4 1/2 somersault was rewarded with 101.75 and his back 3 1/2 somersault scored 100.80 to move him into first place with one dive remaining			2
