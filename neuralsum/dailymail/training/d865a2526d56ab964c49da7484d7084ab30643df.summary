by @entity0 forget the plain old @entity2 — this season ’s chocolate treats are more likely to be flat , soft - centred or pepper - flavoured			1
mum - of - three @entity0 and her chocolate - loving son @entity5 , 12 , give their verdicts on some egg - straordinary @entity2 offerings			1
what you get : an easter egg that looks like a fried egg , with a yellow yolk and ‘ fried ’ white , in a box with small milk chocolate , caramel - filled ‘ chips ’			1
@entity18 ’s verdict : bite into the white of your ‘ fried ’ egg and there ’s delicious vanilla - flavoured white chocolate			1
reach the yolk and the caramel truffle melts			0
the chips are filled with caramel			0
a treat that kept us all laughing			0
@entity31 ’s verdict : funny and tasty and my favourite egg of them all ! normally i do n’t eat egg yolk , but i ate this one			1
what you get : there ’s a real sense of drama as you lift the lid of this elegant black box and the four cardboard walls open out to reveal a beautiful dark chocolate velvet - effect egg on a stand			1
the egg has been hand - sprayed with matte chocolate			1
inside lie six chocolate ganache - filled speckled eggs on a nest of vanilla - flavoured edible shredded paper			1
@entity18 ’s verdict : when you crack open the egg ( it ’s very thick ) , the incredibly life - like mini speckled eggs have the softest , most delicious filling i ’ve ever tried			1
@entity31 ’s verdict : this is a clever egg			1
the taste is more for grown - ups , but eating the straw was awesome ! what you get : a vintage - style box containing a medium milk chocolate egg with sea salt , and a medium dark chocolate egg with chilli and black pepper			1
@entity18 ’s verdict : i do n’t like dark chocolate , but this egg is a delicious mix of pepper and cocoa			1
the crunch of salty milk chocolate in the other egg was even better			1
@entity31 ’s verdict : the dark egg tasted too bitter and the pepper made me cough , though my @entity83 loved it			2
the salty egg sounded like a bad idea but they actually tasted really good together — like having salt on chips			2
what you get : a flat slab of chocolate in @entity96 flavour			2
@entity18 ’s verdict : i found the flavour too sweet , but the children were quick to devour theirs , and pointed out that sickly sweet tastes are what @entity2 is all about			1
i think they missed the bit about @entity102			0
@entity31 ’s verdict : because it was flat , it was easier to stuff loads of chocolate in your mouth at once			2
what you get : a beautiful hen coop with pretty chicken wire and doors that open to reveal milk and dark chocolate speckled eggs inside			2
so beautiful you ’ll never want to throw it away			0
@entity18 ’s verdict : the chocolate melts in your mouth and even the edible ‘ straw ’ is delicious			2
a perfect gift for any age			0
@entity31 ’s verdict : the little eggs are so rich i can tell they are really expensive and i do n’t think these are for kids			0
at least we had the hen house to play with			0
what you get : a pineapple so realistic that i dare anyone not to do a double - take			2
there ’s a subtle spray finish in gold and green , hand - made score marks and a lush green crown made of solid ( gorgeous ) chocolate			1
@entity18 ’s verdict : when i attempted to break into this , it broke into about 20 pieces — making me want to cry			0
this is more like a work of art than an egg			2
@entity146 , tasty chocolate that melts in your mouth , and it comes with a bag of mini eggs with exotic flavours such as @entity154 pepper and lime coulis			2
@entity31 ’s verdict : i preferred this to normal pineapples			0
what you get : a vintage box wrapped with ribbon , which opens to reveal an egg wrapped in bright blue foil			0
inside the milk chocolate shell contains four praline quail eggs and four salted caramel seagull eggs — for whatever mood your teenager wakes up in			1
@entity18 ’s verdict : i tested this on my grumpy 15 - year - old daughter and she loved the box			1
inside , the sweet little eggs almost raised a teenage smile			0
@entity175 ’s verdict : i think my @entity176 reckons she ’s really funny giving me these eggs			1
as if they are just for teenagers ! i slammed my door i was so cross , but actually the eggs are really tasty and the salty ones are gorgeous			0
what you get : a stunning red presentation box tied with white and gold ribbon			0
inside is a chocolate fish with pink and green decorated scales			0
@entity18 ’s verdict : this was really delicious and i appreciated each smooth , rich mouthful — unlike the children			0
@entity31 ’s verdict : my brother and i rowed over who was going to eat which bit			0
in the end i had the tail , he had the eye and they both tasted really nice			0
much nicer than real fish .			0
