a @entity1 mission designed to study the interaction of @entity4 's magnetic field and the sun launched this morning at 2:44am gmt ( last night at 10:44pm edt )			1
the @entity8 ( @entity7 ) mission will use four identical spacecraft to measure a mysterious process known as magnetic reconnection			1
by orbiting @entity4 , the spacecraft will seek to understand how energy from the sun is funnelled in to the environment of not only our own but other planets , causing space weather such as aurorae			1
the spacecraft were launched on a @entity23 421 rocket from @entity24 in @entity25			2
after reaching orbit , each spacecraft deployed from the upper stage of the rocket in five - minute increments			0
' i am speaking for the entire @entity7 team when i say we 're thrilled to see all four of our spacecraft have deployed and data indicates we have a healthy fleet , ' said @entity44 , project manager at @entity1 's @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47			1
magnetic reconnection occurs wherever charged gases , called plasma , are present			0
it 's rare on @entity4 , but plasma makes up 99 per cent of the visible universe , fueling stars and filling the near - vacuum of space			2
this plasma contains magnetic fields that affects the way charged particles it encounters move			2
under normal conditions , the magnetic field lines inside plasmas do n't break or merge with other field lines			0
but sometimes , as field lines get close to each other , the entire pattern changes and everything realign into a new configuration			0
the amount of energy released can be formidable			0
magnetic reconnection taps into the stored energy of the magnetic field , converting it into heat and kinetic energy that sends particles streaming out along the field lines			0
the @entity7 mission will help scientsits understand how this process is taking place in the environment around @entity4			1
this could teach us more about geomagnetic storms and aurorae on our planet , and also help us understand similar processes taking place in the rest of the solar system and beyond			0
over the following weeks , @entity1 scientists and engineers will deploy several complex booms and antennae on the spacecraft , and test all their instruments			2
the core of each spacecraft is about four feet ( 1.2 metres ) tall and 11 feet ( 3.4 metres ) wide , although with all of their booms and antennae deployed , they grow to 369 by 94ft ( 29 by 112 metres )			0
the four will then be placed in a pyramid formation , separated by distances of 6.2 to 62 miles ( 10 to 100km ) , in preparation for science observations that are scheduled to begin in early september			0
they will fly around @entity4 in an elliptical orbit , travelling through two regions where magnetic reconnection is thought to be occurring			2
one of these is the side of @entity4 nearest the sun , where plasma from the sun interacts with @entity4 's magnetosphere			2
this interaction transfers energy from the sun to @entity4 's environment , creating ' magnetic explosions ' when the magnetic field lines connect			1
the process of magnetic reconnection can release bursts of energy that are as powerful as billions of megatons of @entity125 , which send particles surging through space at the speed of light			0
on @entity4 , we can see the effects of this in the aurora at the poles , but it can also be dangerous to satellites and cause problems for communications			2
at the other side of @entity4 , away from the sun , the spacecraft will pass through a region where @entity4 's magnetic field lines combine , and produce a similar effect			1
after reaching orbit , each spacecraft deployed from the upper stage of the rocket in five - minute increments			0
they were stacked together for the launch ( illustrated ) the spacecraft will fly around @entity4 in an elliptical orbit , travelling through two regions where magnetic reconnection is thought to be occurring			1
one of these is the side of @entity4 nearest the sun , where plasma from the sun interacts with @entity4 's magnetosphere the process of magnetic reconnection can release bursts of energy ( illustrated ) that are as powerful as billions of megatons of @entity125 , which send particles surging through space at the speed of light			1
on @entity4 , we can see the effects of this in the aurora at the poles magnetic reconnection can harm satellites ( illustrated ) and affect communications , so scientists are keen to understand more about the phenomenon the spacecraft will sturdy the former phenomenon for one and a half years , while the following science phase will focus on the latter phenomenon			1
' after a decade of planning and engineering , the science team is ready to go to work , ' said @entity184 , principal investigator for the @entity7 instrument suite science team at the @entity186 in @entity187 ( @entity186 )			0
' we 've never had this type of opportunity to study this fundamental process in such detail			0
' the mission will provide the first three - dimensional views of reconnection occurring in @entity4 's magnetic space environment			1
but aside from providing more information about our own planet , scientists will use the data to work out how the sun affects other planets , and also how the process takes place in other stars			0

scientists will use the data to also work out how the sun affects other planets , and also how the process takes place in other stars the data could also provide information on how magnetic reconnection occurs near black holes and neutron stars , and also at the edge of the solar system at the boundary of our sun 's influence and interstellar space			1
' @entity7 is a crucial next step in advancing the science of magnetic reconnection â€“ and no mission has ever observed this fundamental process with such detail , ' said @entity244 , interim director for @entity1 's @entity245 at the agency 's headquarters in @entity248			1
' the depth and detail of our knowledge is going to grow by leaps and bounds , in ways that no one can yet predict			0

@entity1 's @entity8 ( @entity7 ) mission launched from @entity25
four identical spacecraft were taken into orbit at 2:44am gmt this morning
mission will study the interaction of @entity4 and the sun 's magnetic fields
this causes ' magnetic explosions ' that create aurorae on @entity4
but the phenomenon can also be dangerous for satellites in orbit
