@entity6 , 36 , fought back tears outside court as she described her family ’s struggle to carry on without her husband , @entity11 , at their side			0
she has accused the surgeon involved – professor @entity14 – of ‘ playing @entity15 ’ with her husband ’s life			0
he died after an air bubble from a piece of surgery equipment stopped his heart family holiday : @entity11 with his wife @entity26 and daughters @entity28 ( l ) and @entity29 ( r )			1
he never knew that he would have a son mr @entity31 , 43 , who was known to friends as @entity33 , died three years ago after professor @entity14 injected him with an air bubble during surgery to correct a painful knee cartilage problem			1
the bubble caused a massive embolism and led to mr @entity31 having a fatal heart attack on the operating table			2
four weeks later his wife discovered she was pregnant with their third child			1
yesterday , mrs @entity6 said she was ‘ relieved ’ to have been awarded the money , which would provide financial security for her children @entity48 , six , @entity49 , five , and @entity33 , two , who was named after his father			0
she would not disclose the exact amount but it is understood to be at least £ 1million			0
‘ for the past three and a half years i have felt in a state of limbo , trying to find out exactly what happened and why @entity56 died suddenly during what should have been a routine knee operation , ’ she added			0
@entity26 with her husband @entity11 at a wedding ( l ) , and on monday the widow outside the @entity62 ( r ) @entity11 and @entity6 lived in the village of @entity64 , near @entity65 - upon - @entity66 professor @entity14 outside @entity67 on monday , during the inquest into mr @entity31 's death ‘ whilst i am grateful my children ’s future is now at least financially secure , it remains an ongoing struggle to carry on without @entity33 by my side			1
’ she added that she would only ‘ fully come to terms ’ with what had happened if proper answers were given about what happened that day and she was given proof the same errors would never be allowed to happen again			0
mr @entity31 was operated on at the @entity81 & @entity82 and @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity85 , in october 2009 after suffering chronic pain in his knee , which he felt every time he tried to lift his children			1
he agreed to take part in a clinical trial testing new techniques for treating knee cartilage problems , during which stem cells were to be taken from his cartilage and applied to damaged areas in the hope they would regenerate			1
serious problems started , however , after professor @entity14 adapted a piece of equipment without authorisation			1
instead of using a plastic tube to spray a substance to help his blood clot , he used a needle , directing high - pressure air at the wound for several minutes to dry the blood			0
the technique caused an air bubble to enter mr @entity31 ’s veins , which made his heart stop			2
