by @entity0 @entity2 wonderkid @entity1 has clinched a sensational £ 3million move to @entity5 giants @entity4 on a six - year contract			1
the 18 - year - old jetted into the @entity9 capital on tuesday with his agent , @entity10 , his dad and the @entity2 secretary @entity10 to finalise his dream switch to the @entity14 runners - up			1
@entity1 was undergoing a medical late on tuesday night after agreeing personal terms on a contract that would run until 2020 , as @entity4 aimed to rush through the deal in time for their celebrations to mark the club ’s 108th anniversary			1
on the move : @entity1 is on his way to @entity4 and , despite a few legal formalities still to be tied up , senior sources close to the move confirmed to @entity26 that it was ‘ essentially a done deal ’			1
it represents a stunning move for @entity1 who , at the end of his breakthrough campaign in @entity33 football , will now find himself playing in the @entity35 with @entity4 next season			1
the wide midfielder burst to prominence as a young and exciting @entity2 side finished fourth in last season ’s @entity40 and reached the @entity42 , only to lose 2 - 0 to @entity43			2
his form led to scouts from @entity5 powerhouses like @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 beating a path to @entity52 to watch the talented teenager in the flesh			0
it also led @entity2 to shrewdly tie down their @entity57 under - 21 star , who made 42 first - team appearances since his debut in 2012 , by securing him on improved terms until 2016			1
his profile was also substantially raised by his team - mates nicknaming him ‘ @entity63 ’ , due to the similarity in style and build to @entity66 and @entity68 star @entity67			2
@entity69 : @entity1 takes on three @entity71 players during the @entity42 semi-final in april @entity73 : he made 50 appearances for the club in all competitions scoring nine goals @entity78 scores a brace for @entity2 on tuesday , @entity2 boss @entity80 had spoken of his desire to keep @entity1 at @entity52 to build on last season ’s achievements			1
but he admitted the teenage midfielder ’s departure from @entity86 was inevitable after a ‘ life - changing ’ bid was received from the club that honed the talents of @entity47 ’s @entity9 winger @entity90			1
‘ there comes a time when a bid is too good to turn down , not just financially but for the player himself , ’ said @entity80 , speaking before the deal was tied up			2
‘ if it ’s the right club , it could be life changing			0
‘ the initial offer was good enough for us to let @entity1 go and speak to them			2
we ’ ll just need to see what happens over the next 24 hours			0
‘ i would n’t be disappointed if he does n’t go			0
looking at it selfishly from a @entity2 point of view , we ’d want him to stay and play for us next season			0
‘ but , professionally , having been a player myself , you always want people to get a good opportunity			0
so there are two sides to it			0
‘ we have said all along that we know the talent we have with @entity1 and others			2
so we ’ve known that one day people would come in for them			0
it was inevitable it would happen			0

@entity1 clinches £ 3million move to @entity4 on a six - year deal
18 - year - old made his debut for the club in may 2012
went on to make 50 appearances for the club scoring nine goals
