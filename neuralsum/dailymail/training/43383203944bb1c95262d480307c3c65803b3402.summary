by @entity0 published : 19:49 est , 25 november 2013 @entity2 : 19:52 est , 25 november 2013 sudden illness : @entity4 was eventually diagnosed with lupus when 29 - year - old @entity4 noticed that her socks were getting tighter in april this year , she thought she must have put on a little weight			1
' but after a few days i realised that both feet and my ankles and calves were actually swollen , so i booked to see my gp , ' says the trainee veterinary nurse from @entity14			0
blood and urine tests suggested that her kidneys were malfunctioning , so she was referred to see a nephrologist - a kidney specialist - a month later			1
however , before she could see the consultant the swelling started to spread upwards to her thighs			1
@entity4 also began to feel desperately tired			0
' i have a very active job , and was also playing badminton and doing gymnastics and yoga , ' she says			0
' but i started struggling to keep these up			0
one night i came home from badminton in a lot of pain - my whole body ached and my limbs felt heavy			1
eventually i stopped going altogether			0
no amount of sleep seemed to make anything better			0
' @entity4 struggled on , but three days before she was due to see the nephrologist she became seriously ill. ' i spent all day out in the sun with my boyfriend , @entity41			0
by 4pm i felt awful - feverish , achy and off my food			1
then i started vomiting and @entity41 insisted on taking me to @entity44			0
' at the hospital she underwent tests - doctors also commented on a rash across her nose and cheeks			1
' i thought it was just an outbreak of red spots - i 'd had them for a couple of weeks but apparently it was called a butterfly rash , ' she says			1
what @entity4 did n't know was that this rash is a characteristic symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus ( @entity61 ) , also known simply as lupus - an autoimmune disorder in which the body starts attacking itself			1
it affects 50,000 people in the @entity69			1
@entity4 was diagnosed with a specific form , lupus nephritis , which meant that it was attacking her kidneys			1
' i was aware of the illness as i 'd seen it on the tv show @entity75 , ' she says			0
' all i could remember was that the guy on the show had been in a lot of pain and found life very difficult			1
it was shocking to be told this was what i had - i 'd been perfectly healthy just weeks before and now i had an incurable illness			1
all i could think was , “ what have i done to deserve this ? ” ' primary symptoms : signs of lupus normally include fatigue , skin rash and joint pain and swelling @entity61 causes the immune system to turn on itself and start attacking healthy cells , organs and tissues - it 's not known why			1
ninety per cent of sufferers are women , and it generally starts between the ages of 20 and 50 - although in about 20 per cent of people it begins in childhood , usually around puberty , so it 's thought that hormones may play a part in its onset			1
it affects certain groups much more than others - one white woman in 5,000 gets it , yet one @entity115 woman in 625 is affected			2
the main symptoms are fatigue , skin rash and joint pain / swelling			1
' while it is incurable , it can be successfully treated with medications , ' says dr @entity123 , consultant in adolescent and adult rheumatology at @entity125			1
' people with lupus tend to have flare - ups where their symptoms can be severe and debilitating , then the illness can go into remission			1
they can then live for months or even years between flare - ups , where they feel well			1
' medications stop the flare - ups or accelerate their resolution , and most patients respond to them			1
' @entity4 was treated with intravenous steroids in hospital to reduce the inflammation , and discharged after ten days with a cocktail of drugs , including heavy doses of the steroid prednisolone to continue reducing inflammation , a diuretic to help banish the excess fluid and an immunosuppressant			2
she may need to take some of these drugs for the rest of her life , but will be able to reduce or stop others depending on how she responds			2
' in the following weeks i felt incredibly weak , ' says @entity4			0
' my weight plummeted and i ended up back in hospital four times with various problems caused by the lupus , such as gastritis ( inflammation of the stomach lining )			2
i could barely walk and lived and slept downstairs for a couple of months because walking up stairs would wipe me out			0
the fatigue was so physically and emotionally overwhelming - the best way i can describe it is that it felt painful to be awake			1
' @entity41 was amazing , and stayed calm and strong			0
my employers were incredibly understanding , too - i had been just about to take my practical exams to qualify as a veterinary nurse , but had to put that on hold			2
' five months later the medications seem to be working			2
@entity4 has regular blood tests and her kidney function is back to normal			0
she still gets tired easily and rarely goes out to socialise , but she has managed to go back to work for two - and - a - half hours a day , three days a week			2
' the fatigue was so physically and emotionally overwhelming - the best way i can describe it is that it felt painful to be awake			1
' as with most lupus patients , however , it can be difficult to predict when the illness will flare up again			1
' the cause of flare - ups is unknown , ' says dr @entity123 , ' but there are things that can be done to help prevent them			1
excessive exposure to sunlight should be avoided at all times , even in winter , as it can trigger a flare - up			1
' this is thought to be because sun exposure causes higher cell turnover , which in turn releases genetic materials into the blood - these materials are not tolerated by people with lupus			1
@entity201 , 32 , from @entity202 , has been on a roller - coaster of flare - ups since she was diagnosed at 25 , when she was on holiday			1
' i was in @entity207 visiting relatives when i started feeling odd , ' she says			0
' my jet lag would n't wear off and i became really out of breath when walking , which was unusual as i was very fit			0
' a few days later i went to the cinema and when i got up to leave , i could n't move			0
my feet and lower legs had become completely immobile and putting my feet on the ground was agonising			0
' @entity201 was carried out and taken home to rest , and the pain subsided			2
but when she got back to the @entity69 , she deteriorated rapidly and her mother took her to @entity44			1
' i could n't walk and i 'd stopped eating because i felt so awful			0
the doctors suspected lupus and the blood tests came back positive			2
' a friend of my mum 's had lupus , so i knew about the illness			2
i was terrified and felt like a sitting duck , knowing that it can strike any part of the body at any time without warning			0
' @entity201 had trained to be an actor and was at the beginning of a promising career			0
but now she found herself having to be cared for 24 hours a day by her mother			0
' i could n't even dress or wash myself , ' she recalls			0
' i was sleeping my life away because the fatigue was so extreme			2
i became very depressed and my social life was non-existent			0
i was a shell of my former bubbly self			0
' after her doctors experimented with different combinations of medication without much luck , @entity201 finally started to improve in late 2011 - four years after the first attack			1
but in february 2012 blood results showed that her lupus was becoming active again			2
' i 'd noticed that i was getting a lot of mouth ulcers , which is a symptom of lupus , ' she says			2
' within hours i began vomiting and getting terrible headaches			0
' @entity201 suffered several setbacks over the following year , including the lupus becoming active in her kidneys			2
however , after intensive treatment with two new drugs she has started to improve and is hoping to set up a lupus support group in her area			2
' i realised that i have to learn to love my body as it is now and relearn its capabilities			0
' @entity4 , too , is facing the illness with a positive attitude			0
' i 'm so appreciative of the good days i have and the little things that people do for me , ' she says			0
' there was a point when all i could think about was getting through the next few hours , but now that i 'm feeling a little better , i can think about the future again			0
