by @entity0 published : 19:12 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 19:15 est , 4 october 2012 @entity1 : conical breast implants provide a ' natural , voluptuous ' look similar to that of @entity4 she is the poster girl for the curvy lady			1
and while she sets our screens alight with her starring role in @entity12 , @entity8 actress @entity7 appears to be rewriting the rules of beauty			2
the actress ’s voluptuous physique – showcased by her figure - hugging dresses in her role as secretary @entity4 in the @entity20 tv drama – has led to a new trend among women seeking breast implants			1
consultant plastic surgeon @entity24 said that in the last 18 months conical implants have grown in popularity , with 60 per cent of his patients now opting for the shape			1
he said : ‘ up until two years ago all we had was anatomical - shaped implants to offer patients which gave a round , almost cartoonish look			1
' many of my patients are women who have lost volume to their breasts with age , or after having children , and so the conical implant is ideal for them			2
' and what the conical implant does is lift up the breast giving them fullness in the upper part giving a natural voluptuous look , similar to @entity7			1
’ another plastic surgeon , @entity47 , warned it is essential the right volume of implant is used , or patients can end up with pointy breasts , similar to the cone - shaped bras @entity54 once favoured			1
he said : ‘ although patients are keen for a round , natural shape , the implants have got to be used carefully because if they are used in the wrong volumes and in the wrong people you can end up with a pointy appearance			1
’ new trend : more women are choosing conical - shaped over anatomical - shaped breast implants for a ' natural , voluptuous look ' , surgeons say but leading plastic surgeon @entity47 from the @entity67 in @entity69 ’s @entity68 , said it is essential the right volume of implant is used or patients can end up with pointy breasts , similar to @entity54 ’s cone - shaped silver bra which was famously worn in the ' 90s as part of her blonde ambition tour			1
he said : ‘ although patients are keen for a round , natural shape the implants have got to be used carefully because if they are used in the wrong volumes and in the wrong people you can end up with a pointy appearance			2
the actress dressed to show off her much - admired curves at last year 's @entity84 ' the correct type of implant needs to be fitted according to the patient ’s natural symmetry measurements and body shape , ' he added			1
actress @entity7 , aged 37 , came to global attention for her role in the @entity20 drama @entity12 - set in a @entity95 advertising firm during the 1960s			2
but despite being labelled a ‘ role model for fuller figured women ’ , it appears the tv star is not comfortable with this reference			2
yesterday it was reported in an @entity104 newspaper that @entity105 had shut down an interview during which the journalist referred to her as being ‘ full figured ’			0
the flame - haired star is reported to have taken offence at the reference , refusing to answer any further questions			0
when she resumed the interview the actress is said to have muttered off camera ‘ i think calling me full figured is just rude ’			0
but on other occasions @entity116 , who is happily married to fellow actor @entity117 , has appeared flattered by the global admiration her body type has provoked			0
speaking to an @entity20 website , she said : ‘ it ’s such a compliment , because of all those times i had agents who were like : " you have to lose some weight " and all of a sudden , people are celebrating it			0
' it ’s like : " @entity129 thank you ! thank you for letting me be me "			0
' however the tv star also said that while she appreciates her admirers she would n’t encourage women to imitate her			0
speaking about the increase in breast implants in her honour , the actress said , in a separate interview : ‘ i hope i am not encouraging that			0
if there ’s anything to be learned from it			0
it ’s that i am learning to celebrate what i was born with ’ .			0
