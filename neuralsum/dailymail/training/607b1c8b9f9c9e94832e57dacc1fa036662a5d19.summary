a facebook group dedicated to criticizing ' ugly ' babies proves that bullying is not just an act of teenagers			1
the private facebook group , which has since been removed , is composed of grown women around the country who grab photos of toddlers from other mothers ' facebook pages without approval and post them online for criticizing			1
the group was originally designed to trade and sell children 's clothing but took a nasty turn			1
she began posting the mother 's comments online in order to exploit their cruel remarks			1
@entity21 told @entity32 , ' the things that these mothers said were the most horrific things that i have ever seen , being a mom and knowing that they are moms			2
' another mother , @entity18 , of @entity41 , @entity39 told @entity42 she was terrified to discover that a photo of her 2 - year - old daughter was taken from her facebook and pictured next to a cartoon character			0
@entity18 ( right ) spoke to a @entity42 correspondent ( top left ) about the horrific discovery that her child 's photo was being circulated online @entity51 says she did n't realize that friends of friends could access her photos on facebook			1
it was a friend who notified her her daughter 's photo was circulating online			0
' so i 'm posting pictures of my son 's first day in kindergarten or @entity66 's new outfit or something just naively posting it up there so my friends can see , not realizing there 's a group that takes these pictures and targets these children and makes fun of them			2
like that 's just something i would n't even think a mother or grown woman would do , ' @entity51 told @entity42			1
one ' mean girl ' wrote , ' before i address this ... it ... i want to point out that it makes my heart happy that you have a @entity86 tab in your computer			0
now , # 1 is this a he or a she ... you absolutely can not fix ugly			2
this is a @entity96 given example of such			0
' this @entity98 comment was one of the many harsh remarks by the grown - up ' @entity86 ' the comments go on and on in the private ' toddler bashing ' facebook group which has since been deleted the comments themselves are ' hideous ' and most of the mothers in the group have deleted their facebook pages in shame another facebook comment read , ' an ugly baby thread			1
i have died and gone to heaven ... why ca n't you guys live near me so we can do this over cocktails ? ' another commented of a child , ' it 's hideous			1
' the parents of the children who were being bullied commented on the group 's page and asked the women to stop their lewd behavior , but they were none too kind			2
' it 's hideous , ' read the harsh comment under this unassuming child 's photo angry mothers had some ' words ' to say against the mean mothers ridiculing photos of other people 's children one overwhelmed mother wrote , ' this is my daughter that is being made fun of because she is delayed â€¦ so funny , huh ? sick ( expletive )			1
' the photo was of her daughter in the intensive care unit			0
one of the ' @entity86 ' responded , ' @entity149 , not the @entity150 ...			0
this is a free country and i was laughing because it was funny ...			0
thanks for your comments , @entity156			0
' some of the ' @entity86 ' acknowledged that what they were saying was unjust			0
' i 'm probably going to hell for saying that , ' one mother said after criticizing a photo of an innocent and unaware child			0
' we think out children are beautiful and miracles and have somebody even though you know it 's not true to have somebody say something negative or derogatory about your child			1
. it hurts , ' said @entity51			2
some of the ' mean girls , ' many of whom are mothers themselves , defend their behavior by saying that they have a right to free speech			0
most of the mothers in the secret facebook group have deleted their accounts			1
@entity51 reported the facebook group and facebook told @entity42 that they adhere to anti-harassment policies			1
@entity21 says she will not stop going after the ' toddler bashing ' ladies group and she makes it her goal to expose their identities			1
' we have zero tolerance			0
you are bullying babies , ' she said			0
' you 're not even bullying your peers			0
no , ' said @entity21			2
the facebook page has since been deleted , but the damage caused by the bullying still resonates with many			2
