but his unbridled joy quickly turned to humiliation as it became apparent that saturday ’s race was n’t over			0
there was another lap of a 3.1mile ( five kilometre ) circuit left to pedal around			2
’ he joins a long list of sports stars who 've celebrated prematurely , which includes @entity32 coasting towards the finishing line during the @entity34 in @entity35 with his arms raised in victory , only to be overtaken in the final few yards and @entity37 indulging in a victory ' tail - grab ' in the 2006 @entity41 snowboard cross - only to fall over before the finishing line			1

' you ca n't do it on your own and , as strong as my performance was individually in the time trial , my team have taken the strain all week			0
‘ those young @entity99 in my team , @entity97 ( @entity98 ) , @entity96 ( @entity95 ) and @entity100 ( @entity101 ) have done a fantastic job			0
