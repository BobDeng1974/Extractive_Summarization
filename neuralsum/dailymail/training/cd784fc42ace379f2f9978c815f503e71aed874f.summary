by @entity1 reporter published : 02:02 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 15:03 est , 21 january 2014 in late november , @entity3 was hit with some awful news : after battling with ovarian cancer for nearly three years , her doctors told her she had but a few weeks to live			1
with just a few , short weeks left on earth , ms. @entity3 did n't succumb to self - pity or fear - rather , she used her remaining days to essentially have a month - long farewell party , during which she could say her goodbyes to the scores of friends she made in her 62 years on earth			1
' many of us die too soon and have no chance to say goodbye , or we have a long , ugly painful demise , ' her husband , @entity14 , said			0
' @entity19 was neither of those			0
' the end : @entity3 died on january 5 in her 90th @entity24 apartment surrounded by her family @entity3 's final days are recounted in a lengthy piece in the @entity27 , which describes her desires for her final weeks as wanting ' a monthlong farewell party that mixed frivolity and friendship , laughter and tears			1
' ms. @entity3 got her wish			1
' she very quickly made peace with the fact that she was going to die in a few weeks and that she would use that time to say goodbye , ' her husband told the paper , adding that this was not an easy task for a woman who 'd amassed as many friends as his wife			1
rather than spend her final weeks in a hospital or hospice , ms. @entity3 was able to remain in her home on west 90th street in @entity47 , where a medical staff was brought in to give her the care she needed as she prepared to lay down her arms in her long battle against cancer			1
ms. @entity3 - who had a master 's degree in educational psychology from @entity56 - spent much of december sharing memories with her family in the forms of old pictures and home movies			1
mr. @entity14 notes that while there was some crying as he , his wife and their two sons remembered happier times , ' but there was a lot more laughing than crying			0
' ' we did many of the things that people do after death , but we did it before she died , ' he says			2
ms. @entity3 even helped plan her own memorial service , giving her husband specific instructions on everything down to the music and speakers			2
' there was no " woe is me " or " i ca n’t stand this , ’ ” he said			0
' there was just a peacefulness and wanting to wrap everything up			0
' one of ms. @entity3 's biggest regrets was that her unfortunate death would mean she would never meet her grandchildren			1
so , in preparation , her sons brought her a copy of @entity90 - the same book she used to read to them before they went to sleep - and she recorded herself reading it so her future grandchildren could hear her voice and be ' tucked in by the grandmother they never met			1
' another of ms. @entity3 's concerns was who would take care of her husband , as many of her longtime friends confided to mr. @entity14 after her passing			1
in many cases , all she asked of her friends was that they promised to look after the man she 'd spent her life with			2
she could n’t even eat , yet she told me she was really , really happy to be able to help her family deal with the loss before she was gone			0
' she could n’t even eat , yet she told me she was really , really happy to be able to help her family deal with the loss before she was gone , ' friend @entity109 told the paper			0
as her health continued to deteriorate , ms. @entity3 was bound to a wheelchair by the time her 62nd birthday rolled around on december 24			2
but that did n't stop her from having not one but three parties to celebrate her abbreviated life			0
on @entity118 , ms. @entity3 decided that she wanted to have ' one last blowout party ' at the apartment she shared with her husband			2
she invited 20 people and made toasts with ginger ale as she worked the room wearing a pink , fuzzy boa			0
the next day - @entity127 - was the last day ms. @entity3 could speak			0
she died on january 5 - in her bed and surrounded by her family			1
' she had the ability and wherewithal to say everything she wanted to say , ' ms. @entity109 said			0
' it was as if , by facing her death through the prism of love she transcended it			0
