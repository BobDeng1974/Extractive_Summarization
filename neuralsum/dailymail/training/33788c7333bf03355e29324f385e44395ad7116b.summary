may 13 : the date in 1638 when construction began on the @entity3 in @entity4 ; the day in 1799 the @entity0 was signed to end the @entity5			0
but , far more momentously , it is the date in 1983 that @entity7 was born in the @entity8			1
only the most loosely educated of us would fail to remember such a historic moment in the evolution of the human species			0
what happened at his birthday means the club do n’t care about him			2
at @entity15 , @entity7 is no hero			1
he will leave if things carry on like @entity36 did n’t shake his hand @entity25 : @entity7 got a cake but when it was @entity43 ’s birthday , the president of @entity40 gave him a @entity44			1
i do n’t expect a @entity44 , we only asked that they shook his hand			0
the owners do n’t care about him			0
it ’s really @entity49 calms the storm thanks for all the birthday messages			2
card from @entity15 just arrived ... must have got lost in the post			1
please do not take words that do not come out of my mouth seriously			0
judge my commitment to @ @entity15 by my @entity59 changes his mind @entity62 said is true			1
i will give an interview after @entity64 to @entity65 wants more attention @entity25 : we do n’t ask for money , we do n’t ask for presents , we are only talking about attention			1
@entity7 would be in the club for less money but more attention			1
@entity74 just wants cake @entity25 : ok , @entity76 wins best player			1
the club must say something , give a prize to him , a cake			0
sadly , the miraculous birth slipped the minds of @entity15 ’s high - ups , factotums and players a week ago yesterday when @entity7 turned 31 — a landmark birthday , by any reckoning			1
there they all were , as guests of the club ’s owner @entity92 , in the @entity94 on @entity96 ’s @entity95			0
the @entity98 there starts at £ 20,000 a night			0
the occasion ? a celebration of @entity15 ’s title victory			1
running drinks — and who knows what else ? — were laid on			0
but there was one almighty snag			0
there was no super car wrapped in ribbons for the birthday boy — and the cake with which he was presented was smaller than the one celebrating the league triumph			2
no wonder @entity7 ’s agent , @entity114 , was the embodiment of injured outrage when he spoke to the media about this slight			1
not only was @entity7 upset by this snub — diddums — but he is threatening to leave @entity15 over it , possibly to return to @entity21			1
taking umbrage would be risible even if @entity15 were not paying him £ 200,000 a week — or over £ 10million a year — to kick a ball rather well			1
even in a game drunk on money and tarnished by preening popinjays , this act of vanity almost carries the power to astonish			0
what @entity7 ’s lickspittle forgot is that the fact his client is an outstanding midfielder does not stop him from looking preposterous			1
perhaps realising the absurdity of his position , @entity7 at first tried to defuse the controversy in a bizarre series of messages on @entity136 on tuesday afternoon			1
‘ thanks for all the birthday messages today , ’ he told his 439,000 lucky followers			2
‘ @entity140 from @entity141 just arrived			0
must have got lost in the post			0
‘ jokes aside , please do not take words that do not come out of my mouth seriously			0
judge my commitment to @entity15 by my performances			1
’ but , 35 minutes later , possibly after a phone call from @entity25 , he had changed his mind			2
two more tweets appeared , saying : ‘ my agent was trying to make a point here on my behalf			2
i will give an interview after the @entity64 to explain			0
’ sticking the knife in ? @entity7 's cake was dwarfed by that of @entity15 's owners celebrating the title sliding in : despite the outburst , @entity7 is paid handsomely by @entity15 , north of £ 200,000 - a - week it was never going to be easy for @entity7 to detach himself from @entity25 ’s complaints , which were made in a newspaper and followed up a few hours later on the @entity164			1
the two men are exceptionally close			0
@entity7 calls the @entity169 ‘ dad ’ and named his second child after him			2
the pair have a history of lacking self - awareness			0
last year @entity25 whined : ‘ around the stadium , while there are pictures of every player commemorating their recent successes , there is not a single one of @entity7			1
‘ at the @entity182 club shop you can find shirts to buy with the name of every player , but not @entity7 ’s			2
’ @entity15 rightly denied the slur , pointing to huge posters of @entity7 around the @entity188 and replica shirts in his honour			1
yet @entity25 continued : ‘ this is not about money ; a pat on the back is more important than anything			2
’ this is nonsense , of course			0
the principal reason @entity7 signed for @entity15 was money ( just as it was with @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 )			1
he wants the adulation on the side			0
fast car : @entity25 noted that @entity43 was bought a @entity44 by @entity204 club @entity40 on his birthday @entity25 was at it again when @entity7 was named @entity207			1
where , he demanded to know , was the private jet city should have laid on ? @entity25 is like a broken record			2
last year he was threatening @entity7 would leave @entity15 , citing ‘ many reasons ’ , among them the notion his client did not ‘ feel the respect of the staff ’			1
rewind 12 months to may 2012 and @entity25 said : ‘ @entity7 has done all he can do at @entity15 and needs new motivations			1
he would like a new challenge			0
’ ego - mad players and greedy agents are only part of the problem			0
another is clubs indulging their whims			0
@entity226 did that with @entity76 when he was in disgrace for biting an opponent			0
@entity230 accommodated @entity232 ’s posturing demands			0
@entity15 tolerated @entity233 for longer than his insolence deserved			2
it would be amusing — as well as a blow for sanity — if @entity15 gave @entity7 his cake and candles and sent him on his way to earn a fortune somewhere else , somewhere more appreciative , more caring			1
snub : toure was upset by @entity243 not giving him a birthday message			2

@entity7 's agent @entity25 claimed @entity15 showed @entity7 a lack of respect
@entity7 has backed his agent 's claim that @entity15 forgot his birthday
*future* of @entity8 midfielder is now in doubt
