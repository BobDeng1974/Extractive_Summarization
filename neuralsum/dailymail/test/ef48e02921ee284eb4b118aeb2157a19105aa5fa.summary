@entity23 's tries came from @entity52 and @entity53			2
@entity3 , however , left the field at half time to boos and whistles from a section of the @entity60 crowd who were unhappy with a lethargic , error - strewn performance from their team			2
it was the first time the @entity23 had led at half time in the @entity6 this season and , while they did not play well , they fought for everything and scored a well - deserved try in the 38th minute			2
it came moments after a male streaker had enlivened proceedings by running across the pitch			0
he was flattened by a flying tackle from @entity18 before being escorted from the ground by two stewards some were not sure where to look when the streaker ran on to the pitch during the first half imposing number eight @entity18 took exception to the interruption in play by the naked fan @entity18 decided to take matters into his own hands and help remove the streaker whether that proved a distraction to kicker @entity91 is a moot point but the winger then missed a relatively easy penalty before the @entity23 took the lead with a try after a surging run from @entity18			1

@entity109 ' conversion made it 7 - 0 and the crowd sat back and probably expected an avalanche of points against a side already relegated , having gained just one bonus point all season and shipped 869 points before this match			0
. the pitch invader managed to get back to his feet despite the hit from @entity18 the streaker was finally escorted from the ground by two stewards but the rout never came as @entity3 made error after error , particularly at the breakdown , and after @entity91 had missed a 16th minute penalty he put the visitors on the board with a beauty from a metre inside his own half			2
the @entity136 ' lead did not last long because @entity3 , probably after a half time rollicking , scored three minutes after the break , @entity138 getting the touchdown after a rolling maul , the decision coming from the @entity142			0
@entity4 got his second seven minutes later , finishing off a lovely outside break by @entity145 to make it 17 - 10			0
