by @entity0 we are not quite halfway through @entity4 — thanks to your quaint sunday off — and although they have had their setbacks , the men ’s @entity1 are sitting pretty			1
@entity7 and @entity8 will be happy as they are not affected by the delay caused by saturday ’s weather , which sees @entity12 and @entity13 facing four matches in six days			1
i am still fairly confident that two of my pre-tournament favourites , @entity7 and @entity18 , are in good shape to emerge as champions			1
my guy : @entity7 looks in good shape to emerge as champion for the second time at @entity4 practice : @entity7 has been in great shape , has n't slipped and looks set to go all the way at @entity27 my other choice : as does @entity18 , practicing on the sunday off of @entity4 @entity7 , my one - time pupil , impressed me in week one and although he takes a step up today against @entity30 i am sure he can handle it			1
the @entity32 goes big on both first and second serves but @entity7 ’s returns have been coming right out of the middle of his racket			1
@entity37 seems to be doing a good job as his coach and i am sure she will agree that a key aspect is to keep @entity30 moving and off balance because he is a lethal power hitter if allowed			1
he does not like long rallies and will try to hit winners from all over			0
my hunch is that there will be at least one close set , possibly two , but that @entity7 will prevail			2
my impression is that @entity8 is moving better than last year and that is crucial to his chances			2
four matches in six days is a challenge for @entity13 but i have liked what i have seen so far and his serve has been outstanding			1
i expected @entity12 to have a tough first week but the the court should turn more in his favour as the week goes on			2
@entity1 hit : four matches in six days is a challenge for @entity13 but he 's looked impressive so far preparation : @entity12 has had a tough week but still remains on top and it should turn in his favour the serious danger comes from @entity61 and @entity62			1
@entity61 ’s game is made for grass and i have always had him pencilled in for a possible quarter - final against @entity7			2
@entity62 has been the most improved player on grass i have seen this year			0
as for that serve — you could spend a week playing him and not manage to break			0
nobody has done it so far			0
@entity73 ’ defeat by 24th seed @entity74 was a real shock and the fact that the top two women ’s seeds have gone out of the first week in the past two @entity80 suggests a changing of the guard			0
former champion @entity83 told me that when you get into your 30s there are days when your body just feels a bit flat			2
well , @entity73 is 33 in september — and she is human , too			0
it would also be a great story if @entity90 was to come through			0
i do n’t like the way she is constantly asked about her private life so it would be a great response			0
bonus : it would be a good story if @entity90 was to come through in a rousing response			0

the men 's @entity1 - @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity12 and @entity13 - are sitting pretty at @entity27
@entity7 and @entity18 are still my predicted champions
@entity37 will be key to @entity7 's chances at @entity4 but appointing her as coach has worked so far
four matches in six days is a big ask for @entity13 but he 's been outstanding
@entity12 has had his ups and downs so far but remains a *strong* *contender*
