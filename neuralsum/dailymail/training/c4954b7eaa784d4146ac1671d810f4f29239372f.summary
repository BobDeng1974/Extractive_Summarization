and he the @entity11 has not been quiet in his criticism of his former boss in his new autobiography , @entity0 : @entity15			1

@entity0 , 43 , has managed @entity31 and @entity30 , as well as currently being assistant boss at both the @entity47 and @entity48 , and has admitted he does envisage returning to coaching in the future			1
