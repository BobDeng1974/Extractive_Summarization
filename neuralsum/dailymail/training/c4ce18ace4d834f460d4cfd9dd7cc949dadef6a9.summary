the moon may be a familiar sight in the night sky â€“ but because it 's tidally locked to @entity4 , there is one side of the lunar surface we never see			1
this side was a mystery for centuries			2
it was n't until the @entity14 @entity13 probe visited the area in 1959 , that astronomers had any real idea of what it looked like			0
now @entity20 has released a stunning animation of the moon 's far side - once known as the ' dark side ' - with @entity4 looming in the background			1
' just like the near side , the far side goes through a complete cycle of phases , ' @entity20 explains in the video			2
' but the terrain of the far side is quite different			0
it lacks the large dark spots , called maria , that make up the familiar @entity43 on the near side			0
' the animation takes the moon through the 29.5 day period of phases			1
@entity20 has released a stunning animation of the moon 's far side - once known as the ' dark side ' - with @entity4 looming in the background			1
the animation takes the moon through the 29.5 day period of phases in the background , the @entity4 can be seen , appearing to move in a figure eight as it reveals itself and disappears behind its satellite in the background , the @entity4 can be seen , appearing to move in a figure eight as it reveals itself and disappears behind its satellite			1
in another series of animations , a spinning @entity4 looms large in a time - lapse telescopic view			2
the animation places an imaginary line between the @entity4 and the @entity64			1
from this vantage point , the moon looks full , but on @entity4 , it 's a waning crescent			1
with a view fixed on the moon , the rest of the solar system seems to dance around it			0
the far side is also home to one of the largest and oldest impact features in the solar system , the @entity76 , visible in the animation as a slightly darker bruise covering the bottom third of the disk			2
its diameter is roughly 1,550 miles ( 2,500 km ) , making it stretch across nearly a quarter of the moon			0
while parts of the crater are shrouded in perpetual darkness , its rim features huge mountainous peaks that are bathed in near - constant sunlight			0
@entity90 wants to send robots to these peaks , and eventually humans			0
it says the crater 's rim is an ideal place to land humans because they have ' the potential for near continuous solar power and a spectacular view over the rugged and cratered landscape below			0
the animation places an imaginary line between the @entity4 and the @entity64			1
from this vantage point , the moon looks almost full , but on @entity4 , it 's a waning crescent pictured is an evolving view of the lunar farside over 60 years			1
on the right is what astronomers believed it looked like in 1969 , while the left shows a more advanced image constructed in 2009 the far side of the moon could someday be home to human colonies if @entity90 has its way the @entity90 believes that conquering the moon is a crucial step for human deep space exploration			1
in a video , titled ' destination : moon ' , the agency outlines its plans for making a home on the hostile terrain that covers the far side of the lunar surface			2
' in the future , the moon can become a place where the nations of the world can come together to understand our common origins , to build a common future , and to share a common journey beyond , ' the video says			0
@entity90 is hoping to find out if water exists on the moon , and if so , they want to understand where it can be found			0
if the moon has huge stores of water , future colonies could use the hydrogen and oxygen atoms to create rocket fuel			0
' [ this could ] propel us further into the solar system and onto the next destination of our journey into the cosmos , ' the video says			0
future missions could also use the far side of the moon as a shield against radio signals coming from @entity4 in order to look farther into space .			1

because it 's tidally locked to @entity4 , there is a side of moon we never see
the animation takes a look at the moon from perspective of its far side
in the background , @entity4 can be seen appearing to move in a figure eight
another angle shows @entity4 looming behind what looks like a full moon
