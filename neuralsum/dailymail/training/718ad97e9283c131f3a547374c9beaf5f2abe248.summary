@entity0 sent a strong message to coach @entity2 that he is the man to inspire @entity3 with arguably his best performance in an international jersey			1
however , the diminutive @entity6 insisted that his inspiration for steering his side to a thrilling 41 - 31 win over @entity10 at @entity11 had come from the new head coach			1
‘ i just think it was great for this group of players to have someone like @entity2 coming in from a team like @entity18 , who were pushing the standards in @entity21 , ’ he said			2
stand - off @entity0 inspired @entity3 to a thrilling 41 - 31 win over @entity10 ‘ he just really gives us confidence to go and try things			1
he understands that mistakes happen , that nobody wants to make mistakes , and i made a mistake for the first play of the game			0
it was n’t a great pass but i maybe should have just held it and then we were seven points down			0
‘ but i just thought “ park that , mistakes are made and we have a game - plan to go out and play ” and , on the whole , we executed that			1
‘ @entity2 gives you confidence to do that , i think			0
he gives you confidence in training to try different things , to express yourself and try to beat players one - on - one , and does n’t bollock players unless it ’s ridiculous — and i think that ’s been the key change			2
’ @entity0 had found himself switching from scrum - half to stand - off to cover @entity52 weaknesses in recent years and , while he was delighted to answer @entity3 ’s call wherever needed , there is little doubt that it asked a lot of the relatively new international to flit between two different roles and the mental complexities that each position brings			1
add on the responsibility for goal - kicking , while striving to lead a struggling @entity64 side , and there is perhaps no surprise that his own form wavered at times			2
@entity3 's @entity0 makes a break to set up a try for @entity70 he took the decision to leave @entity64 this year and has found a new lease of life at @entity76 , where his quality of service has quickened , his speed over the ground has improved and his confidence is bubbling up again			1
the result is that , installed back in the no 9 jersey and asked to captain the side when first choice @entity83 was injured , @entity0 stepped up to the plate last night and guided the team to one of the most convincing wins witnessed against a top - 10 nation at @entity11			1
‘ i have got the spring back in my step , ’ he said			0
‘ going down to @entity76 , it ’ s a very hard competition and you get to understand pretty quickly there that they are hard games week in , week out and you have to win games			2
so they are all pressure games and that has helped me			0
‘ but just going to a new club helped me where you want to prove yourself again , and so you have to work hard			0
but also coming back up here i knew that @entity102 and @entity103 ( @entity104 ) were also playing well and that was pushing me too for today ’s performance			2
@entity70 celebrates scoring a try with team - mates @entity108 and @entity0 ‘ i enjoyed the game out there but , as @entity2 said , one to 15 the boys put their bodies on the line so we were all ‘ man of the match ’ in my eyes			1
‘ scoring 41 points … i ’ve not done that too many times in a @entity3 jersey , and @entity3 have n’t done that for a while			1
‘ but we will keep our feet on the ground because we gave away a couple of soft tries			0
there are always things to work on , especially with the best team in the world coming to play next week			0
we ’ll need to turn up for that big style			0
’ looking ahead to the visit of his native @entity132 , @entity2 added that the final quarter where @entity3 conceded 21 points would figure prominently in analysis as would the scrums that started to struggle late on			1
‘ we ’ll be very honest about the end of the game and how we conceded penalties , ’ he said			0
‘ we want to be consistent and resilient all over the park and i think sometimes we scrummaged very well and sometimes perhaps did n’t			0
