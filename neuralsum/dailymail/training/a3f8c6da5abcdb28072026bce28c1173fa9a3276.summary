in an age where we 're busier than ever and bombarded with information 24/7 , many of us complain we do n't get enough sleep			0
but getting too much shut - eye could actually be bad for your health , an expert has warned			2
' the lowest mortality and morbidity is with seven hours , ' says @entity11 , a professor at @entity13 @entity12 who studies sleep duration			1
rest : seven hours of sleep is the best amount for your health - and more could be harmful , a sleep expert has declared ' but eight hours or more has consistently been shown to be hazardous , ' he told the @entity19			1
just last month a study of almost 9,000 people found those aged 50 to 64 who slept for less than six hours a night - or more than eight - had worse memories and decision - making abilities			1
but brain power was only reduced for older adults of 65 to 89 if they slept too long , say the @entity28 researchers			0
recent research published in the @entity30 adds to the argument we may not need as much sleep as we think , writes @entity19 journalist @entity34			0
when five adults lived for two months in ' @entity38 - like conditions ' - no clocks , electricity or running water - they got on average 1.5 hours extra sleep than usual and fell asleep two hours earlier			1
but they still only averaged 7.2 hours a night , he writes			1
despite many of us believing we are chronically sleep deprived , most of us are getting ' more than we strictly need ' and most of us are probably getting more sleep than we strictly need - we 've just convinced ourselves we 're sleep deprived , says sleep neuroscientist professor @entity50 , of @entity52			2
he believes that far from us all being exhausted , ' things have never been better '			0
unlike the typical worker from 150 years ago , who toiled for 14 hours a day , six days a week and went home to a crowded , flea - infested bed , most of us sleep perfectly adequately			1
there have been several large studies over the past 40 years into how much sleep people actually get			2
the findings show that the average healthy adult sleeps for seven to seven - and - a - half hours a night			1
professor @entity50 , author of the book ' @entity64 ' , adds the much - repeated ' fact ' that our ancestors used to sleep around nine hours is a myth			2
he says it 1913 study by researchers in @entity71 , which found that children aged eight to 17 slept for this amount of time			0
' there is a lot of fear - mongering about the so - called dangers of lack of sleep - but , in fact , the biggest danger of not having adequate sleep is having an accident , such as falling asleep at the wheel of a car			0
' and which sex needs more sleep ? women - because their brains need more time to recover from the wealth of multi-tasking they do each day			0
the @entity94 scientists , in @entity95 , found women who are sleep deprived often suffer from depression and become angry .			0

' lowest mortality and morbidity is with seven hours ' , says sleep expert
those who sleep more than eight have memory and decision *problems*
people who slept in @entity38 - like conditions only got 7.2 hours on average
