@entity0 heaped praise on @entity2 after the @entity4 captain began his long goodbye with a match - winning display at @entity8			1
just days after confirming this would be his last season at @entity12 , the 34 - year - old led the @entity13 out at @entity14 for what would prove a tough third - round clash			1
few expected @entity4 to come a cropper against the @entity19 side but , had it not been for @entity2 , an upset akin to @entity8 's 1988 fa cup final triumph against the @entity13 could have been witnessed			1
@entity2 runs away in celebration after giving @entity24 outfit @entity4 the lead against @entity8 @entity2 looks on as his fine free - kick goes over the wall on its way to securing @entity4 a 2 - 1 victory @entity2 's early header was cancelled out by the @entity32 ' giant striker @entity31 , only for the @entity13 captain to brilliantly curl home a free - kick to secure a 2 - 1 victory			1
it was the kind of display @entity0 says highlights why @entity2 is ' one of the biggest and best ever ' - a tribute he paid to the @entity4 captain when after his exit was confirmed on friday			1
' as i said in my statement , my small tribute that i did for him , his qualities are evident to see week in , week out , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity46 @entity0 , in action at @entity8 on monday , hopes @entity4 can continue their @entity48 run ' on monday that was the case again			1
he scored two fantastic goals and got us through			2
' he deserves ( a fantastic send - off ) for what he has done through his career for the club			0
' it would be a nice goodbye for him ( to win the @entity48 on his 35th birthday ) , but it is a long way			0
we just have to keep going			0
' it 's always important to be winning things and we have the chance in the @entity63 , as we 're in the semi-finals			0
@entity0 , attempting to challenge @entity31 , has hailed @entity2 's performance at @entity14 ' now ( we are through in ) the @entity48 so hopefully we will put the same desire which we put in the @entity63 and get to another final			1
' @entity4 certainly have the weapons in their armoury to go on to win the @entity48 , although they will need to put in vastly - improved displays			2
few could argue that @entity8 did not deserve @entity31 's leveller , with the hosts close on several other occasions to causing an upset			2
@entity31 runs away in celebration after ' the @entity76 ' gave @entity8 hope against @entity4 ' we knew it was going to be a hard game , ' @entity0 told his club 's official website			1
' always this draw away from home is always hard			0
' they played with a lot of intensity and commitment , which made it hard sometimes			0
we probably did n't keep the discipline of our shape			0
' i think in the second half , we controlled it better and we could score the goal			0
but we won and that 's what we wanted and now we can concentrate on the next game			0
