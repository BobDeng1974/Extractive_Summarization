a @entity1 mp is making a bid to buy the house where @entity4 was born to destroy it - thus thwarting plans by the town 's mayor to renovate it into luxury apartments			1
@entity10 , a lawmaker from the ruling @entity12 party , is aiming to collect £ 1.8m from supporters to buy the house in the @entity16 town of @entity17			1
he said : ‘ i would buy this property in the blink of an eye if i had that kind of money myself , but i do not			0
if i were to receive financial help , i would buy the house and destroy it demonstratively			2
’ plans : developers want to turn the former @entity27 where @entity4 was born ( pictured ) into apartments while @entity1 mp @entity10 wants to buy the house to destroy it die - hard communists , who still remember the 27 million @entity33 citizens who died in the ' @entity34 ' against @entity4 , are in favour of his plan			1
@entity37 , a member of the @entity40 's @entity39 fraction , said : ‘ everything that is connected to fascism should be wiped off the face of the earth			0
‘ no one should even know that place ever existed			0
@entity16 's interior ministry has rented the house since 1972 from the owner - a woman in her 60s who refuses to be identified publicly - and has been careful to sublet only to tenants with no history of admiring @entity4			1
as it was : pictured in 1966 , the building had been , variously , a girl 's school and a public library , after @entity58 most recently it has been used as a centre for disabled people ' destroy it demonstratively ' : @entity1 mp @entity10 said he would buy this property ' in the blink of an eye ' if he had the money town mayor @entity66 opposes a @entity68 museum at the site and believes that turning over the former @entity27 to become family homes would be one way of ‘ de-stigmatising ’ @entity17			1
if the plan - approved by the mayor and proposed by a local building consortium - was accepted it would mean the room where @entity4 was born would become a bedroom in self - contained apartments with state - of - the - art kitchens and bathrooms that would go on the market for an estimated £ 400,000 each			1
such a plan , say experts , would require vigorous vetting of prospective buyers to ensure that a single flat , indeed the entire property , did not fall into the hands of neo-nazis masking their real identities and purpose behind a shell company or individuals			0
the little @entity16 town separated from @entity94 by a short bridge over the @entity96 , is still visited by hordes of far - right fanatics each year who come to pay homage at the site where the future @entity102 was born on april 20 1889			1
up until a year ago it was the ironic setting for a workshop for the mentally and physically handicapped ; the sort of people @entity4 deemed as ‘ useless eaters ’ and the first to die in the @entity109 's secret euthanasia campaign before @entity58			1
past : mayor @entity66 supports the plan for apartments that would go on the market for an estimated £ 400,000 each - saying it would help ' de-stigmatise ' the town but it has been empty for a year now with the state picking up the bill for the lease and a debate raging about what to do with the two - storey listed building			1
mayor @entity66 said : ‘ @entity17 has done much to process its history over the years			1
it is not necessary to build a @entity68 museum in the house as some have suggested			0
‘ @entity17 as a town is already stigmatised enough			2
@entity4 spent only three years of his life here , and they were certainly not the most formative years of his life			2
‘ why should i or others take responsibility for him ? i was born 21 years after the end of the war			0
’ the mayor said he was open to all suggestions , saying @entity17 wants an ‘ affordable solution for all			2
i can imagine all possibilities for the house ’			0
but he is against turning it into a ' @entity146 ' or a ' @entity147 ' as @entity149 members have advocated , believing the town has done enough atoning over the years for its most infamous son			0
nationality : @entity4 's birthplace is just a short distance from the @entity94 border			0
the @entity109 leader returned to annex and occupy his homeland during the ' @entity158 ' in 1938 marker : a memorial stone ( pictured ) was placed outside the building in 1989 as a reminder of its history			1
in @entity166 the inscription reads ' @entity167			0
millions of @entity169 [ us ] ' it was in a room on the first floor of the three - storey , 2,000 square foot house at @entity175 15 that @entity4 ’s mother @entity176 gave birth to her infamous son			2
she and her husband @entity180 , a stern local customs official , rented a suite of rooms above the pub and continued to live in it until 1892 when they moved to @entity186			0
@entity180 , a drunkard , often availed himself often of the beer on sale in the saloon downstairs before returning to the family home to abuse his timid wife , 24 years his junior			0
the house is still owned by the family after which the pub took its name			0
owner @entity198 says she wants to sell because she no longer wants to have the responsibility for it			0
nothing remains inside the building to indicate its link with @entity4 , not even the bedroom where he was born			2
pay homage : the little @entity16 town of @entity17 is separated from @entity94 by a short bridge over the @entity96 , is still visited by hordes of far - right fanatics each year who come to pay homage at the site where the future @entity102 was born on april 20 1889 the only @entity109 - era relic is on an iron gate outside , the initials mb for @entity4 ’s party secretary @entity216 , who had them placed there when he declared the house a national monument after @entity4 took over @entity16 in 1938			1
during the 12 - year lifespan of the @entity109 it was a must - see place of pilgrimage for loyal @entity224			1
@entity216 bought the house with @entity109 funds and made it a cultural centre which displayed @entity109 - approved art. it was given back to the @entity198 family in 1952 and served as the town ’s public library until 1965 before becoming , in turns , a school , a bank , a technical institute and finally the home and workshop for disabled people			1
those who want it turned into a site of remembrance for @entity4 's crimes are pressing central government in @entity245 to compulsorily purchase the property .			2

@entity1 mp @entity10 wants to buy the house where @entity4 was born to destroy it
town mayor @entity66 plans to renovate it into luxury apartments to ' de-stigmatise ' the property
each apartment could sell for around £ 400,000
@entity109 leader was born in the pub in @entity17 in @entity16 in 1889
he lived there for three years with his parents in *upstairs* rooms
became a place of pilgrimage for loyal @entity224 during the @entity109
