from food to houses , it appears there is very little that a 3d printer ca n’t be used for			0
and now a hacker in @entity6 has built a website that lets people design their own sex toys , as well as 3d print them out			1
users can create different shapes , as well as adjust the height , curviness , colour and angle of the toys to produce a @entity18 computer model			1
one hacker in @entity6 has built a website ( picutred ) that lets people design their own sex toys , and print them out			1
users can create different shapes , as well as adjust the height , curviness , colour and angle of the toys to produce a computer model the website shows a basic shape of a sex toy			1
users can click on points on the outline of the @entity34 model to transform its shape			0
a 3d model changes according to their design tweaks			1
users can change the height , width , curviness , angle and the colour of the sex toy as well as other options			1
it is possible to create bizarre shapes			0
a box displays statistics about the toy including how much silicon is needed to print it out			0
in theory , users could print out their design themselves			0
if they do not have a high quality 3d printer , the site lists places in @entity6 that can help			0
this can be printed on a public 3d printer , or reserved for printing at home			0
@entity60 used programming language @entity63 and @entity62 to build his ‘ extrusion / revolution generator ’			1
users of the website are greeted with an outline of a basic sex toy and can manipulate different points on the @entity34 drawing to change its shape to suit their preferences			0
the height , width , curviness , angle and the colour can be altered by selecting various options to create strange shapes , the likes of which may not be on offer at places such as @entity83			1
a design immediately appears as a colourful rendered 3d model to reflect the changes made to the initial basic shape			2
a small box on the right - hand side of the generator displays information about the design , such as the toy ’s height , weight and volume , so that the amount of silicon to make it can be calculated			2
while most people do not have a sufficiently advanced 3d printer at home that can handle piping silicon , the tool does , in theory , allow anyone to print out a sex toy of their own design , @entity99 reported			2
users of the website tool are greeted with an outline of a basic sex toy ( pictured ) and can manipulate different points to change its shape to suit their preferences while most people do not have a sufficiently advanced 3d printer at home ( stock image ) that can handle piping silicon , the tool does , in theory , allow anyone to print out a sex toy of their own design the website suggests a number of @entity125 in @entity6 that could help – if someone is brave enough to ask for assistance			1
the generator also lets people order a mould and a silicon toy , or just the mould itself , but the people involved in the idea warn : ‘ the software and the silicone casting is still somewhat experimental			2
’ the cost of 3d printers is falling all the time , but many affordable consumer offerings only allow people to print objects made from crude ‘ strings ’ of molten plastic - meaning the result is not smooth or professional looking			1
however , high - end printers are being used to make prosthetic limbs , plaster casts and even kidneys and 3d printed tumours			2
giant versions of the machines are currently being used to created £ 3,000 bungalows in @entity155 , for example , and the technology could revolutionise kitchens too			0
a @entity159 created in @entity160 earlier this year can 3d print interesting pancake designs , while another machine creates piped snacks made from crushed insects			0
the curviness and style can be altered by selecting various options to create strange shapes ( pictured ) - the likes of which may not be on offer at somewhere such as @entity83			0
designer @entity60 used programming language @entity63 and @entity62 to build his extrusion / revolution generator			2

' extrusion / revolution generator ' lets people design sex toys from scratch
the generator was created and built by a @entity6 - based hacker
users create different shapes and adjust the height , curviness , colour and angle of the toys to make a 3d model
this model can then be printed on public or *private* 3d printers
