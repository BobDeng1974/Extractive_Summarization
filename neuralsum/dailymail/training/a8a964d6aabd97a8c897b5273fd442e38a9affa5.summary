officials say thousands use the @entity28 , which guarantees the ‘ right to family life ’ , or fears about violence in the countries they left as a way of dodging deportation			1
around 800 of the foreign criminals have been at large in @entity16 for more than five years			1
the revelations last night prompted calls for the government to withdraw from the @entity17 so that the foreign offenders can be sent home			2

he said : ‘ there are 3,980 foreign nationals in the @entity16 subject to deportation action living in the community			2
we continue to pursue removal in all these cases			2
‘ the principal barriers to removal are non-compliance on the part of individuals which means we have insufficient evidence of nationality and identity to obtain a travel document , ongoing legal challenges and the situations in countries of return			2
’ home secretary @entity14 has issued new guidance to judges saying section 8 of the @entity28 , which guarantees the right to family life , should not override serious criminality in deportation cases			1
but critics say that is not enough to solve the problem			0
@entity94 mp @entity93 , who asked the parliamentary question that led to the publication of the figures , called for the abolition of the @entity28			2

‘ the public deserve to have a robust immigration system in place to keep them safe instead of laws and rules designed to help foreigners remain in @entity16 when they should have no right to be here			0
‘ hard - pressed taxpayers will be disgusted to learn that they are footing the legal fees and living costs associated with this number of foreigners overstaying their welcome			0
’ sir @entity122 , chairman of @entity123 , said : ‘ this is an extraordinary number			0
offenders and their lawyers are clearly playing the legal system			0
‘ the case for pulling out of the 60 - year - old @entity17 gets stronger by the day			0
the government is trying to give better guidance to the courts but that is most unlikely to have the necessary impact			0
' the only long - term solution is to pull out of the @entity17 completely and write our own human rights law			0

' an earlier version of this report of @entity139 figures carried the headline ‘ 4,000 foreign murderers and rapists we ca n’t throw out … and yes , you can blame human rights again ’			0
we appreciate that unless the headline was read together with the first paragraph of the article , the impression may have been given that all those people were murderers and rapists			0
we are happy to clarify that the ‘ 4,000 ’ refers to the 3,980 foreign criminals currently subject to deportation orders , a total which includes murderers and rapists , some of whom committed offences while on immigration bail .			1
