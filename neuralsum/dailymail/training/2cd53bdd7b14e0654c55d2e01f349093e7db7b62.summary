forget making time for your family , the average @entity1 household manages to spend as little as three hours and six minutes of quality time together in a week , according to a new study			1
long working hours , lengthy commutes and after school clubs mean parents can only spare an average 62 minutes to chat or play with their kids , on three typical week nights			1
and after chores and domestic duties , only five hours and nine minutes of play time are squeezed out of the average weekend			1
it has been revealed that the average @entity1 family only spends three hours and six minutes together a week in fact , seven in ten of the 2,000 parents polled confessed the only real guaranteed quality time they spend with their family is on their one annual holiday			1
the poll also found that keeping fit was keeping the family apart with 35 per cent saying their family members take regular exercise , but mainly through solo activities such as gym workouts or @entity32 lessons at school			2
for many of those polled quality time just simply is n't an option with a fifth of parents agreeing they never have a chance to do things as an entire family , as the kids ' after - school clubs and parents ' working late prevents them from returning home at the same time			2
a further 26 per cent said it 's too hard to get the kids out of their bedrooms , while almost four in ten parents said they 're usually glued to their phones or tablets			0
even when it comes to the weekend @entity1 is struggling for time			1
with school and work commitments dominating the week , over half said that laundry , grocery shopping and ' life admin ' are top priorities on saturdays and sundays			0
weekends are also spent ferrying kids to football practice , the research showed , as well as their friends ' houses and birthday parties			0
work infiltrates home life with one in ten parents admitting to answering office emails in their downtime and working life often spills over into the weekend for one in ten , who said they spend a lot of their ' down time ' answering work emails			1
when they do get together as a family , eight in ten adults said their time is still spent separately - with family members often distracted by their phones or laptops			0
the majority of those surveyed ( six in ten ) agreed that when they spend time with a family member they would rather watch a film together than try a bonding family activity like swimming or a bike ride			1
a helpless 35 per cent of parents think their kids find family time ' boring ' , and admitted they struggle to find something to do that everyone can enjoy			0
amazingly , the same amount said that their kids are so absent that most of their interaction is through texting or @entity104 messaging rather than face to face			1
with so many obstacles , half of parents admitted they often feel like giving up on spending significant time with the children			2
school extra-curricular activities are another element that separates families during the week although over half agreed that exercising together is a great family activity , one in ten of the adults said they can only find the time for it once every month			2
a spokesman for @entity120 , which commissioned the study , said : ' it seems everyone is leading very busy lives , but very little quality time is being spent together as a family			0
' it 's difficult to be upbeat after a hard day at work , and often we end up retiring to our rooms early			0
' being distracted by the internet , television and other modes of technology is also to blame			0
' the spokesman added that it is important for families to ditch their technical devices every now and then and spend some quality time together outdoors			2
' rather than parents and kids doing everything separately , families would benefit from finding things they can do together - like exercise			1
' ' these days everything we do is so tech - based , with handheld devices often stealing the show			0
' putting our phones and tablets down and getting out of the house to do something active together is great for bonding , and could inject some energy back into our family lives			0
