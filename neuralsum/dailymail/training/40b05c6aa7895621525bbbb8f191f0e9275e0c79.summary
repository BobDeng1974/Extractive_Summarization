it was a dramatic night of football at the @entity2 as @entity4 's side contrived to give away a three goal lead and draw with @entity7 side @entity6			2
@entity8 were cruising after 58 minutes thanks to @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 but in the final 30 minutes crumbled and conceded three goals			1
here , @entity15 's @entity14 gives his verdict on how the players performed on tuesday			1
@entity8 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity18 - 6 @entity19 enough early on to save @entity8 from falling behind			1
@entity20 - 5 beaten by @entity21 for the first @entity6 goal			1
per @entity24 - 5.5 steady early on - but terribly weak to allow @entity26 the equalising header			0
per @entity24 ( right ) tackles @entity28 - 5.5 never 100 per cent certain and exposed when he gave penalty away			0
@entity31 - 6.6 a quieter game , but dependable			2
consistently the best in the back four			0
@entity10 - 6 great penalty - but early on there were large gaps in front of the back four			0
@entity10 opened scoring for @entity8 with a chipped penalty @entity39 - 5.5 @entity40 is there but still yet to reach the heights of last season			1
@entity12 - 7 excellent form			2
great finish for his goal and always injecting pace and momentum			0
involved in all three goals , never stops battling and a phenomenal finished			0
@entity11 shoots and scores @entity8 's second goal with a volley from 20 yards @entity54 - 6.5 busy and unerringly accurate			1
@entity55 has a poor game			1
@entity57 - 6 started brightly			0
offers an outlet and troubles opponents , as he proved when he won his marginal penalty			0
subs @entity64 6 ( for @entity10 63 ) @entity65 6 ( for @entity12 82 ) @entity66 6 ( for @entity57 82 ) @entity6 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity67 6 ; @entity68 6 , @entity69 6.5 , @entity70 5.5 , @entity71 6.5 ; @entity72 6 , @entity73 6 ; @entity74 7 , @entity75 6.5 , @entity76 , 5.5 ; @entity77 5.5 subs : @entity21 7 ( for @entity79 ) , @entity80 6.5 ( for @entity69 54 ) , @entity26 7 ( for @entity81 )			2

@entity8 's *defenders* had a poor game with @entity20 *struggling*
@entity11 and @entity12 are @entity8 's best players
@entity39 made first start since *september* but was quiet
