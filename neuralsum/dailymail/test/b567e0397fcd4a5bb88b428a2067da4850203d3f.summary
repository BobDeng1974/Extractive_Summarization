the mighty boot of @entity1 kept the @entity3 flag flying in @entity4 as the @entity5 kicked @entity6 through to the @entity8 semi-finals with a famous last - minute penalty			1
no chorus of boos or whistles would stop the sweet strike rising above the 1950s tower blocks in the @entity16 suburbs , with the ice cool 31 - year - old mobbed by players and coaches as @entity21 were unceremoniously dumped out of the competition			1
it was the @entity24 ’s finest moment since he arrived on continental shores			0
referee @entity27 was escorted off the pitch by security but his call – penalising replacement lock @entity31 with 10 seconds left on the clock – was the correct decision and ensured a classic finale to match bereft or flair and finesse			0
scenes of elation as @entity6 clinch victory with the last play of the match against @entity21 @entity1 kicks the match - winning penalty from long - range to snatch @entity46 's a semi-final berth @entity47 raises his arms aloft after being entrusted with the final kick of the game @entity1 jumps into the arms of @entity52 after his successful kick as @entity54 joins the celebrations @entity1 is mobbed by his elated @entity6 team - mates after his kick sails over the posts for the win @entity3 's first team through to the semi-finals in the @entity63 semis celebrate @entity21 : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78			1

tries : nil penalties : @entity54 ( 2 ) , @entity93 , @entity117 : @entity90 ‘ the last time i kicked to win the game was when i was 21 and playing for an amateur club in @entity122 , ’ said @entity1			1
' it was from more or less the same range and it was against our clasico rivals			0
it was a great memory for me , but it was a long time ago			0
‘ i tried to be as relaxed as possible			0
we had the wind in our face and i did n’t want to force it			0
i tried not to think about what it represented and i said , “ why not ? i can take it			0
” the rest is history			0
with kicks like this , you ’re either the hero or the bad guy - i ’m happy that it went my way			0
’ it was the sort of strike that was associated with @entity146 during his illustrious playing career with @entity148 and @entity149			0
the retired no 10 , now kicking coach for the @entity152 side , watched helplessly from the stands of the @entity154 as the ball sailed between the posts to set up a knockout meeting with @entity158 in @entity159			2
@entity93 leaps the tackle of @entity65 during the @entity8 quarter - final outside @entity162 @entity54 kicks the first penalty of the match to give @entity6 a 3 - 0 lead @entity6 full back @entity93 ( centre ) evades @entity21 's @entity169 centre @entity67 ( right ) racing and @entity171 scrum - half @entity70 crosses for the only try of the first half in outer @entity162 @entity158 v saracens , @entity175 , @entity159 , saturday , april 18 , 3.15pm ( gmt ) @entity177 v @entity176 , @entity178 , @entity179 , sunday , april 19 , 3.15pm ( gmt ) racing are a team who , in their early years , would play wearing berets and bow ties			1
they would drink champagne at half time but this was an abrasive and at times unabsorbing encounter , offering little to inspire the @entity162 painters couched on the sidelines to capture the moments of magic			2
the partisan home crowd were angered by two of @entity27 ’ decisions in the opening quarter , with the @entity197 not penalising @entity93 for a block on @entity199 winger @entity68 and scratching off a potential try for @entity72 because of a knock on			2
@entity54 kicked two first - half penalties – either side of a 27th minute try for @entity70 after @entity6 lost an attacking scrum - @entity205 was shown a yellow card , the tourists were fortunate to go into the break with a one - point advantage			1
‘ we were n't great in the first half , even though we had a very strong wind , ’ said @entity6 director of rugby @entity210			1
‘ we were unable to build any pressure			0
playing into that very strong wind and with @entity69 playing no 10 for the opposition , being 6 - 5 up at half time felt like a mountain to climb			1
@entity1 is an @entity5 utility back who moved to @entity4 in 2006 to play for @entity220			1
he joined @entity6 in the 2013 - 14 season and has featured predominantly at centre			1
he is not @entity6 ’ first - choice kicker - @entity223 , @entity54 and @entity93 are all above him - but he has a hugely powerful strike			1
it ’s earned him cult status with the @entity228 crowd , who chant ‘ @entity47 , @entity1 , @entity231 ’ whenever he lines up one of his kicks			2
as a teenager , @entity1 played football in @entity234 but claims that it was always his dream to play rugby in @entity3			2
he married @entity237 last summer and they are expecting twins			0
@entity1 's football skills aid his powerful kicking @entity21 winger @entity68 shows his speed to avoid @entity95 and escape the in - goal area @entity6 ' stand - in captain @entity54 places his grubber kick underneath @entity76 @entity21 and @entity149 fly - half @entity69 ( left ) locks horns with @entity6 winger @entity249 @entity249 is upended going for a high ball against @entity21 's @entity64 , who escapes a yellow card ‘ but that 's where it turned around and i 'd say our second half performance was as courageous , brave and hard working as i 've seen			1
we went hunting and kept knocking them down , scrapping for absolutely everything			0
our rugby could have been better and it was n't a beauty of a match , but we put them under enough pressure to make some errors and give us a chance			0
’ cigarette smoke filled the air and , having never previously progressed from the pool stages , the hosts looked like they were choking on the pressure			0
racing did most of the running but @entity6 edged further ahead , with @entity93 also adding his weight to the kicking with a 47th minute penalty			1
@entity92 and @entity21 centre @entity67 threatened in attack , but was hauled off in the 52nd minute			2
@entity1 then tackled his countryman @entity65 just short of the line – although the pitch - length move was subsequently pulled back for a forward pass – and @entity281 intervened with a crucial turnover to snuff out a @entity21 attack			1
but @entity6 were unable to build upon their lead and , just past the hour mark , @entity21 narrowed the gap thanks to three points from @entity70			1
a game of kick tennis ensued and the @entity199 no 9 pushed his side into the lead with his second penalty 10 minutes later			2
the blue and white flags were waving and the bass drum was beating but , sacrebleu , @entity21 tried to run down the clock			2
then @entity31 came flying off his feet at the crucial moment			0
@entity1 stepped up for the penalty and , after a short run up , his kick floated gracefully between the sticks			2
@entity3 no 8 @entity281 fends off @entity21 centre @entity302 at @entity304 in @entity16 @entity69 fires a bullet - like pass as he clears the ball from the ruck against @entity6 @entity6 winger @entity94 gets a kick away under the tackle of @entity5 @entity65			1

@entity1 kicked penalty with last play of the game for victory
@entity6 took a half - time lead of 6 - 5 despite @entity21 's dominance
penalties from @entity54 ( two ) and @entity93 for @entity6
@entity21 scrum - half @entity70 scored the game 's only try
@entity6 will return to @entity171 to face @entity158 in the semi
