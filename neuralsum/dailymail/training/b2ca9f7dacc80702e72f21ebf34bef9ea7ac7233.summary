a @entity1 teenager at one of @entity4 ’s top public schools was left distraught after a teacher said she would be sent to ‘ one of your gas chambers ’ because she had jumped the lunch queue			1
the astonishing outburst happened at girls - only @entity12 , whose former pupils include actress @entity14 , @entity16 founder @entity15 and @entity18 editor @entity17			1
the teacher has apologised privately to the girl for the horrifying remark , but the school refuses to identify the woman or explain what , if any , disciplinary action has been taken against her			1
the incident took place at the girls - only @entity12 which was rated ' excellent ' in all categories in a recent inspection last night , the parents of the girl , who was 17 at the time , urged the headmistress to make a public statement to underline the seriousness of the incident			1
the @entity36 knows the girl ’s identity but has agreed to a request by her family not to publish her name			2
according to her father , the offensive comment was made after the girl committed a minor misdemeanour by unhooking a rope barrier within the lunch queue as she entered the dining hall in january			1
it was overheard by a large number of other pupils waiting in line			2
the girl ’s father said : ‘ a teacher was passing by and she rushed up to my daughter and said , “ do n’t do that or i ’ll have to send you to the back of the queue or to one of your gas chambers			1
” ’ the teacher , who has worked at the school for several years , was not one of the student ’s subject tutors and there had been virtually no previous contact between the two			1
the pupil ’s father – who is a successful businessman – said : ‘ it was very unpleasant , very uncalled - for and very unfortunate			2
my daughter was shocked and upset			0
she did n’t say anything to the teacher at the time but all her friends expressed amazement			2
they kept saying , “ did she really say that ? ” ’ movie star @entity14 , left , and @entity18 editor @entity17 , right , are both former students of the school the matter was reported by another family to the @entity82 , which combats anti-semitism in @entity4			1

the teacher who made the remark has apologised privately to the student , who is now 18 and studying for her a-levels			1
but the girl ’s family say there has been a lack of transparency in the disciplinary process because it is not clear what sanctions , if any , the teacher has faced in the three months since the incident			1
the father said : ‘ the school does n’t deserve to be in the middle of a race issue			0
it is normally a model of correctness in these things			0
‘ but there should be an element of visibility so people see the teacher has been disciplined			0
my wife and i would also like the school to make a public statement that there has been an incident and [ the remark ] was totally unacceptable			2
’ @entity15 said : ‘ when i was there , it was a most inclusive school in which everyone was very aware of the rights of others			1
it was a model of tolerance and i am absolutely astonished by this incident			0
