an international panel of scientists will today launch a major inquiry to discover whether official world temperature records have exaggerated the extent of global warming			1
the panel , convened by the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , the ‘ climate sceptic ’ think - tank led by the former @entity8 chancellor @entity7 , will focus on thousands of ‘ adjustments ’ that have been made to temperature records kept at individual weather stations around the world			1
sceptics have argued that the effect of such adjustments – made when instruments are replaced or recalibrated , or heat - producing buildings are erected close to weather station sites – has skewed the records			1
sceptics : the panel will look at whether ' adjustments ' made to temperature records around the world have made climate change appear worse - or whether they actually manage to cancel each other out the panel will also examine ‘ extrapolations ’ – when the records include virtual figures from places where there is no actual measuring station , instead basing them on the figures of other stations in the same region			1
in some areas , such as the @entity43 , these may be hundreds of miles away			2
sceptics claim that the effect of the adjustments is usually to revise temperatures from decades ago downwards , and to increase recent readings , so that the warming trend of the past 150 years looks larger than it really is			2
the panel has been drawn from leading universities around the world , and includes scientists with widely differing views on climate change			1
panel member professor @entity55 , a physicist and climate expert from @entity57 in @entity58 , said he had been concerned about the records ’ quality for many years , after noticing that when you examined an individual station ‘ you ’ll see a sudden jump ’			1
such jumps , he said , were not natural , but the product of adjustments			0
‘ sometimes you get “ corrected ” data without knowing exactly how it has been changed			0
i ’m not going into this with any preconceptions			0
but if some of the corrections have not been properly made , then we ’ll find out			0
we want to see all the actual station data			0
’ dr @entity76 , the @entity11 director , said the panel would try to look at all the thousands of stations whose data goes into the three main world temperature records – those kept by the @entity82 , @entity83 , and the @entity85 government agency that deals with weather			1
tensions : the group have brought together people from all sides of the debate to look into the problem , and is asking as many people as possible to hand data over			2
pictured : climate change protest ‘ the question is , do the adjustments balance each other out ? ’ he asked			1
‘ do they make half the stations a little warmer , and half a little cooler , or is there evidence of bias ? ‘ it may turn out there is no problem			0
it may that there is			0
’ he said the panel ’s work would be ‘ transparent ’ , with all data made available though a public website			2
the panel ’s chairman is professor @entity117 , former vice-chancellor of the @entity118			0
he said : ‘ while we believe that the @entity121 warming is real , we are concerned by claims that the actual trend is different from – or less certain than – has been suggested			0
‘ we hope to perform a valuable public service by getting everything out into the open			0
‘ we hope that people who are concerned with the integrity of climate science , from all sides of the debate , will help us to get to the bottom of these questions by telling us what they know about the temperature records and the adjustments made to them			1

climate sceptic group @entity11 launch inquiry
panel drawn from leading universities includes experts with differing views
will look at whether ' adjustments ' made to records cancel each other out
says it hopes people from all areas of climate change will help the panel
