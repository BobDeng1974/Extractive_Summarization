tucked away in the north - eastern corner of @entity1 live the @entity3 people , a @entity5 group who live a way of life that 's different in almost every way from that of the majority @entity11			1
and life has n't always been easy for the @entity3			2
persecuted by the @entity13 following a failed bid for independence and accused of terrorism by the rulers of modern @entity1 , the @entity3 are hard to access , hidden away from visiting tourists and despised by many of the @entity11			1
now @entity21 photographer @entity20 has shed light on the fascinating world of the @entity3 after travelling to @entity24 , the sprawling semi-autonomous region that they call home , and revealed how the @entity3 are using traditional garments as a means of silent defiance			1
@entity30 : this elderly woman , photographed in the city of @entity33 , is wearing a banned @entity34 - the world 's smallest hat - on top of her equally illegal veil outlawed : women who wear traditional veils such as this one can not enter petrol stations , banks or hospitals and are also barred from taking government jobs persecution : men who grow beards are barred from government roles			1
recently @entity50 introduced laws that forbid lawyers - and their families - from wearing them colourful : an elderly man photographed in the market at @entity33 and a @entity58 woman who has travelled across the border to shop sporting traditional garments there he found people struggling to survive and dealing with endemic discrimination that includes being barred from many jobs and having their homes demolished on spurious grounds			2
' the government claims it ’s demolishing the houses due to seismic issues , ' says @entity20			0
but the @entity3 tell a different story			2
' one told me that it 's not just the homes that are being demolished but their souls , ' he continues			0
although @entity5 , the @entity1 government discourages the wearing of @entity79 headscarves and women are not allowed into petrol stations and other shops if they are wearing one			1
' in gas stations , women must remove their veils is they want to be served , ' explains @entity20			0
' the same applies in hospitals , administrations , banks and so on			0
the @entity89 see veils as linked with terrorism			0
but in reality , the majority of @entity3 women still wear veils			1
' elegant : there are @entity3 populations in most of the surrounding countries including @entity100 , where these women come from , @entity102 and @entity103 tradition : this young @entity3 woman shows off her pencilled brows , joined together by a line of black ink			2
single brows are considered beautiful by the @entity3 happy family : the @entity3 , in a rare concession , are exempt from the @entity112 and are allowed two children in cities and up to four children in the countryside @entity117 : according to @entity20 , the exemption has made the @entity11 angry , with the result that many @entity3 families struggle to support themselves and are very poor the @entity1 government also takes a similar approach to traditional @entity79 beards , an initiative that sparked riots as recently as june			1
' the measure was introduced during the 2008 @entity127 , but was n’t respected , ' adds @entity20			0
' nevertheless , government workers can not have beards or mustaches			0
' but despite the simmering tension between the @entity3 and their @entity11 neighbours , their culture continues to flourish , not least in neighbouring @entity137 countries , including @entity103 , @entity100 and @entity138			0
and despite the @entity1 government 's efforts to prevent it , the @entity1 @entity3 cling to their traditions , including the wearing of the @entity34 - the world 's smallest hat			1
' in @entity33 , i photographed a woman with a @entity147 hat , which is a sign that the woman is married , ' explains @entity20			0
' the antiterrorism law forbids them from wearing it , except for funerals			0
wearing it is a sign of defiance			0
' defiant though they might be , with news yesterday of yet another @entity1 government crackdown on ' illegal religious activities ' , the @entity3 fight for recognition and respect within @entity1 looks set to continue			1
community : the @entity1 government discourages visitors to the @entity3 home region and accuses the people of being separatist terrorists playtime : a small boy plays with his beaker , perched precariously on a tray of fruit being sold at the @entity33 market by his colourfully dressed mother celebration : this @entity3 marriage photographed by @entity20 had been sealed off in an alley by @entity1 authorities in an attempt to conceal it from tourists childhood : uighur children also live a traditional lifestyle , and play with traditional wooden swords , or in this little girl 's case ( above ) the tomb of ruler @entity189 the origins of the @entity3 tribe lie deep in the @entity192 of @entity193 - or in @entity194 , depending on which version of the story you believe			1
according to the @entity3 themselves , their origins are @entity201 and date back more than 5,000 years			0
by contrast , the @entity1 say the @entity3 are descendents of the @entity204 tribes of @entity193 , who by 842 , had coalesced into the @entity3 people and moved en masse to the @entity207 in what is now modern @entity1			1
either way , the debate around the origins of the @entity3 is yet another skirmish in the ongoing battle between the majority - @entity5 tribe and the @entity11 for centuries			1
mainly tolerated during the long rule of the @entity1 emperors , the real problems for the @entity3 began after the @entity13 swept to power in 1949			2
after a failed bid for independence , the @entity1 cracked down on the fledgling state and the @entity24 which they call home is treated as a semi-autonomous state run along similar lines to @entity227			1
activists accuse the @entity1 government of steadily eroding the @entity3 ' freedoms , among them curtailing religious , commercial and cultural activities			1
@entity50 has also been accused of seeking to dilute @entity3 influence by arranging the mass immigration of @entity11 , the country 's majority ethnic group , to @entity24 , with the result that the @entity3 have become a minority in their homeland			2
according to @entity1 , their activities are justified because of the terrorist threat posed by @entity3 separatists			2
the @entity3 themselves dispute this claim			0
source : @entity246 @entity247 : like their parents , @entity3 children sport brightly patterned garments including elaborately beaded and embellished hats @entity11 influence : the route into the @entity3 city of @entity256 takes you past a square dominated by a statue of chairman @entity260 hazard : many of the @entity3 believe the @entity11 deliberately spike their food with pork so will only eat at cafes and restaurants belonging to trusted friends			0

the @entity34 , the smallest hat in the world , is worn by @entity3 women to show that they are married
the @entity3 , the majority of whom are @entity5 , are also banned from wearing veils and growing beards
the @entity1 government outlawed beards for officials in 2008 , leading to riots , most recently in june
@entity3 live in a semi-autonomous province of @entity1 , which is run along similar lines to @entity227
