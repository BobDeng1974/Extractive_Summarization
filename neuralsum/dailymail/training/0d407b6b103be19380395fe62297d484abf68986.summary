by @entity0 published : 17:21 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 03:57 est , 1 april 2013 police are sending bouquets of flowers to victims of burglaries and muggings – crimes they often have difficulty solving			1
they claim the gift helps ‘ soften the blow ’ , but it can also be accompanied by a note explaining that officers are closing the case for lack of evidence			2
the policy has divided opinion among victims – some saying they feel ‘ fobbed off ’ and others praising the ‘ lovely thought ’			1
the @entity23 and @entity24 police forces are among those who regularly send bunches to victims of burglaries			1
but rates of detection can be as low as 12 per cent in these areas			0
the @entity23 and @entity24 both send bouquets to victims of burglaries and muggings @entity23 police officers have given out around 300 bouquets since the initiative began in november			1
most have gone to elderly women living alone			0
@entity38 , 55 , received a bunch of flowers from @entity23 officers in @entity42 following a burglary at her home			1
she had two laptops , a camera and other valuables stolen two weeks ago and police sent a crime scenes officer to dust for fingerprints the following day			2
later that day , they sent a card saying : ‘ sorry you have been a victim of crime , unfortunately in this case there is insufficient evidence to proceed and investigation into your crime will now be closed			0
’ the following day , a £ 25 bouquet of flowers arrived by courier along with a voucher for £ 5 off future purchases from the florist who donated it			0
mrs @entity38 said : ‘ it was nice to receive them , but the thought that went into that could have gone into solving the burglary , like putting pictures of the things that were stolen in the local paper in an effort to recover them			0
‘ i ’d rather they ’d had sent a community support officer to comfort me after it happened rather than being fobbed off with flowers			2
’ some burglary victims said the flowers were a ' lovely thought ' , while others said would have preferred officers to do more to get back their stolen goods last year , there were 3,405 residential burglaries , 12.2 per cent of which were solved by police , or 6,795			1
the latest @entity93 figures show that the national average number of burglaries in @entity96 and @entity97 that are solved is 13 per cent			0
a spokesman for the @entity23 in @entity42 said victims usually took the gifts as a positive gesture			1
' giving someone flowers helps soften the blow and shows we are there to support them , ' he said			0
police in @entity24 , who have a 24 per cent success rate in solving burglaries , have also been sending bunches of flowers to victims for four years			1
one couple from @entity115 , @entity116 , were given flowers by an officer after they were burgled			0
@entity119 and @entity120 , who are both in their 70s , were tricked into letting a man into their house who then stole a wallet with £ 90 cash inside			0
mrs @entity120 said : ' the thoughtfulness of the police in helping us in this way is very much appreciated			0
we really did n't expect them [ the flowers ] and it was a lovely thought			1
' the flowers are paid for out of a police community fund which survives on proceeds from the sale of unclaimed property , contributions from staff and donations from the public			2
a spokesman for @entity24 said : ' it brings the force and people much closer together , which is how policing used to be			2

one victim felt ' fobbed off ' by gesture but others said it is ' lovely thought '
