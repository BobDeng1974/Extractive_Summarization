by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 fly half @entity3 believes there will be added spice to saturday ’s opening test against @entity7 because of @entity2 ’s humiliating defeat at @entity9 in 2012			1
@entity3 's side had no answers in the 38 - 21 rout by @entity7 and the 25 - year - old feels the result - their only defeat in 35 games - is still fresh in the mind of the @entity19 public			1
this summer 's tour is @entity7 ’s first visit to @entity2 since that famous encounter and @entity24 ’s understrength side must be prepared to feel the full force of the @entity2 at @entity26 , where the hosts are bidding to defend a 20 - year unbeaten record			1
needle : @entity2 's @entity3 believes there will be added spice to the opening test against @entity7 ‘ our supporters and our fans know who the last side to beat us were and they fully understand the threat this @entity41 side possess , ’ @entity3 told @entity33			1
‘ it ’s massive for us ; rugby is the number one sport in @entity2			1
the media are saying this is an understrength @entity41 side , but we do n’t see that as the case at all			2
when they pull on the @entity41 jersey we know they will do everything they can to get the result for their team			0
’ ‘ we ’ve got a pretty handy record at @entity26 but it ’s something we do n’t often talk about			1
it seems to be a bit of a fortress for us and hopefully that can continue			0
’ @entity3 has taken over the no 10 jersey in place of @entity2 icon @entity63 , who is playing no part in the three - @entity65 following a sabbatical			1
the 25 - year - old will line up against @entity68 and , while team - mate @entity69 was unable to name one @entity7 player earlier in the week , @entity3 has clearly been doing some homework on his opposite number			2
‘ @entity68 made his debut against us a couple of years ago and i ’ve watched a bit of his footage , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ he ’s a good player ; he ’s got a sound right - footed kicking game and he ’s a really good organiser			2
we ’ve got to be aware of the threat that he poses and try to shut him down as much as we can			0
important cog in the machine : @entity3 should prove to be integral for @entity2 at the weekend @entity7 roar : @entity82 celebrates scoring a try during the 38 - 21 win two years ago eyes on the prize : @entity3 will operate at fly half for the @entity2 in the place of @entity63 at @entity26 know all about him : the hosts kept a close eye on @entity91 while he was with the @entity92 ‘ we saw @entity91 a little bit with his time at the @entity92 , but we do n’t get to see as much of @entity68 playing back in the @entity96			1
we just have to do our preparation and make sure we ’re ready for whatever they throw at us			0
’ @entity7 coach @entity24 has had to turn to fringe players such as @entity68 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 in the absence of regular starters from @entity105 and @entity106			0
they will all be hoping to make their mark and , similarly , @entity3 also sees saturday ’s @entity109 as an opportunity to put up his hand for a run of games in the starting jersey			2
the 25 - year - old edged out @entity116 in selection and his long - term target is to challenge @entity63 to be first choice at next year ’s @entity120			2
‘ you always want to be in that starting xv and i ’m really excited and grateful to get the start this weekend , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ for me it ’s a case of understanding my role within the team and , whether i ’m starting or on the bench , i just have to put my best foot forward and push my claim to get that starting jersey			0
‘ i looked up to @entity63 growing up a youngster and now to be able to rub shoulders , pick his brain and ask questions can only be beneficial for my game			0
the healthy competition that we have within the squad now really encourages you to keep getting better every day			0
’ tough ask : @entity24 must cajole one of @entity7 's biggest performances in order to get anything @entity3 was speaking on behalf of @entity145 , the official insurance partner of @entity2 @entity120			1
join the conversation @ @entity148			0

@entity2 hosts the tourists at @entity26 on saturday
they are looking to avenge the 38 - 21 defeat at @entity9 two years ago
