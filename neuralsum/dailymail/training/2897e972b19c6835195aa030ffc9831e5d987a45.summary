by @entity0 published : 07:35 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 08:25 est , 5 december 2013 the war in @entity2 may have brought progress in the medical field , but the international aid has not reached the remote villages of @entity2 where traditional ' cures ' sees patients imprisoned and forced to live on nothing but bread in stinking cells at the local shrines			1
the @entity16 shrine in village of @entity18 , outside the eastern city of @entity14 , is no different , and many locals still believe that the grim ordeal at the shrine will cure mental health problems , or as they see it , possession by ' evil spirits '			1
there are a myriad of reasons why the ' patients ' are locked up at the shrine , a majority forced by family members , ranging from depression to family arguments			1
a man named @entity36 explains that he has been chained up for 40 days over a fight with his father , but some of the unfortunate are never collected from the shrine and stay for six to eight months in the shrine			1
not all survive , and their bodies are buried in the yard			0
locked away : @entity45 , aged 30 , can not explain why he has been chained to a wall at a holy shrine in the village of @entity18 , on the outskirts of @entity14 ‘ i had a big argument with my father , ’ said @entity36 , a thin young man sitting on a dirty blanket with heavy chains around his ankles and wrists			1
‘ i took money from him to buy a motorbike			0
‘ i am very unhappy and i am angry at him that he put me here			0
’ @entity36 , who says he has five war wounds after serving in the @entity2 army , is incarcerated in a row of 20 miserable stone cells			1
the ceilings are low and damp , and there are no fans in the summer or heating in the winter			0
‘ the patient is kept in chains for 40 days on a diet of bread with black pepper , ’ said @entity69 , the shrine supervisor			1
‘ he is given this to make bad spirits goes away			2
when someone is infected by ghosts , we read verses of the @entity81 , and married women without children give them amulets to make the spirits depart			1
’ ‘ it has been the same for 360 years , and thousands of people have been cured			2
’ ancient beliefs : the ' patients ' are chained up for 40 days and forced to live on nothing but bread and water as their relatives hope the incarceration will ' cure ' them of evil begging for help : a mentally ill @entity2 man rests on the ground of his filthy cell @entity101 's holy shrine , his hands chained and padlocked caged : there are varying reasons for why a person is locked up at the shrine , many suffer from mental health issues , while others have had a family argument visiting : @entity2 children look on at a shrine , while a man in chains look out on the village of @entity101 on the outskirts of @entity14 no escape : one of the mentally ill men smiles for the camera			1
some of the ' patients ' are never retrieved by their relatives and spend six to eight months at the shrine , some perishing as a result at the end of the course , the ‘ patients ’ are given broth made from goat 's head to complete the cleansing process			1
those undergoing the gruelling regime appear in fast - deteriorating health and barely able to talk due to exhaustion			2
‘ i did not want to come , my brother forced me , ’ said @entity45 , in his 30s , in a weak voice , unable to explain why he was sent to the shrine			1
‘ they told me they would take me to a doctor and they took 5,000 @entity142 ( £ 55 ) from my pocket for that			0
i feel dizzy and have headaches			0
’ @entity45 's cell stinks of sweat and urine , and it is littered with trash and soiled linen			2
children approach the cell to mock him , before running away laughing as he shakes in desperation			0
@entity154 , a doctor and director of a psychiatric hospital in @entity157 , dismissed the shrine 's treatment as ‘ having no basis in scientific fact ’			2
‘ no matter how aggressive a patient is , if you do n't give him much food for 40 days , he will get quieter , ’ @entity154 said			1
‘ in @entity2 , there have been these traditional ways of treatment for mental patients , chaining them up in rooms or shrines			1
in some cases , patients are suffering from depression or mental problems			2
’ few changes : despite more than ten years of support and funding throughout the war in @entity2 , medical progress has not reached the remote villages where tradition is king village life : an elderly man walks near the shrine , past the graves of ' patients ' who have died while locked up to be ' cured ' trickery : @entity45 's brother forced him into the shrine where he was told he would see a doctor and charged 5,000 @entity142 , approximately £ 55 before they chained him the campaign group @entity194 has called for the @entity16 shrine , named after a 17th - century holy man , to be closed and there is also concern from local rights activists			1
‘ this place should be shut down as its practices are not compatible with human rights , ’ said @entity194 researcher @entity200			0
‘ mental health treatment is at its basic stages in @entity2 and unfortunately has not been a high priority for international donors in spite of the fact that many @entity2 have experiences of serious trauma			1
‘ @entity212 , of the @entity213 , described how families leave patients to live in appalling conditions at the shrine			2
‘ they think that it is the last option ... we can not ignore it , ’ he said			0
‘ these families are not satisfied with government medical services , that is why they rely on the shrine			0
’ ‘ the environment that the patients live in is unhealthy , they defecate and urinate in their cells			0
i remember the stench and filthy environment when i visited			0
’ for @entity36 and @entity45 , the greatest fear is that they have been incarcerated not to be cured , but to die			0
from their cells , they can see the rough graves of those who never left			0
‘ some families do not come back for the sick who remain for six or eight months and sometimes die , ’ said caretaker @entity237			0
‘ we bury them here			0

@entity2 's *medieval* ' cure ' for what local believe are evil spirits sees thousands locked away every year
men and women are chained at a local shrine and forced to live on nothing but bread for 40 days or more
everything from mental health problems to family arguments are blamed on evil spirits , known as ' *jinns* '
