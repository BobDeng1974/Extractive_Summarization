by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 09:42 est , 11 october 2013 the @entity1 has shown that @entity3 cockroaches can tell each other apart by where they were born and prefer to stick with other insects from their neighbourhood they 're traditional @entity3 in that they prefer to stick to their own neighborhoods and have strong family ties , but any semblance to those whose homes they inhabit stop there - they are cockroaches			1
research by the @entity1 project has shown that the household pests tell each other apart by their place of birth , and avoid those who are n't from the same ' neighborhood '			1
accordingly , cockroaches native to the @entity25 and @entity26 and @entity27 can and do breed with one another , but they prefer to stay in their home areas with their own species			2
@entity31 , a senior research associate , told @entity32 : ' the diversity was a big surprise to us and the fact that they 're not just all mixed together - it 's not a random assortment			0
' so they must be staying close to home , and they have their own neighborhoods			0
' @entity31 joked that the insects were more similar to @entity3 than most residents would like to admit , adding that they are ' immigrants ' , descending on @entity44 from all over the globe			1
researchers are trying to track the most common cockroaches in @entity44 and work out how they migrated across the country ' we know these are tropical species that are thought to have come from @entity53 , though there 's no definite proof of that , ' he said			1
' they require a very warm , moist environment			0
and we 've made a nice home for them in cities , because we have underground tunnels and sewers where they can live year - round			0
' in the summer they come up above ground , and that 's when we usually see them			0
sometimes called palmetto bug or waterbug , the @entity44 cockroach is the most common large roach in the @entity44 and thought to have hitch - hiked to the continent from @entity53 inside goods shipments			1
they commonly inhabit warm , moist environments in man - made structures , including basements of large buildings , steam tunnels , and sewers			0
the smaller cockroaches seen in homes and apartments are usually the @entity86 cockroach			1
in warm weather , the @entity44 variety may be seen roaming urban sidewalks at night particularly near large buildings , street drains , and manhole covers			1
' but they 've only been here as long as we 've had an underground environment that 's congenial for them			0
' the @entity1 is a research initiative by @entity98 which wants to find out the origins of the @entity44 cockroach , and understand how it has migrated across the country			1
using genetic barcoding the project tracks different species across the @entity44 and relies on samples sent in by citizen scientists			1
these include schoolchildren who are asked to post cockroaches they find for examination - although the website emphasizes all samples must be dead first			2
while the project collects specimens from all over the country , @entity3 are the most likely to post the vermin in			0
' we 've gotten about 200 specimens , either mailed in or [ hand - delivered ]			0
most are from the @entity44 , from @entity3 , ' @entity31 said			2
' we 've had better luck getting @entity3 to pick up cockroaches than we 've had elsewhere			2
' one of the researchers joked that , just like real @entity3 , the cockroaches are all immigrants coming to the city from overseas anyone wishing to kill a cockroach may have their work cut out for them as the hardy species has been known to survive a nuclear blast			2
they can also survive being decapitated from their bodies for a number of days , until the head starves to death due to its inability to eat .			0

cockroaches can tell when others were n't born near them
tend to avoid those from outside their own ' neighborhood '
