the legs exciting the most intense fascination in @entity2 this weekend do not belong to the tallest show - girl or the sexiest lap dancer on the famous @entity2			1
it is the muscular under - carriage of the wealthiest athlete in town which is attracting the closest attention			0
it is the legs which weaken first when even the greatest of boxers reach a certain age			0
videos scroll down to watch ... @entity17 lands a punch on @entity19 during their first bout in may but lost the brutal fight @entity19 is 37 now and there are many among the blood brotherhood of the prize - ring who believe they are detecting a tell - tale slowing of the dazzling footwork which has helped him bank hundreds of millions of dollars			1
that speed of movement is as important a weapon in @entity19 ’s formidable armoury as the lightning hand speed and he did not appear as quick across the canvas in his last fight			1
on that night here , four months ago , this most elusive practitioner of the noble art of self defence found himself obliged to stand and trade hefty punches with @entity44 slugger @entity17			1
after being roughed up like never before , @entity19 now goes into a re-match with that same presumptuous opponent			1
and @entity47 returns emboldened yet further by how much physical hurt he has already been able to inflict on the world ’s best pound - for - pound fighter			0
@entity51 works with his uncle @entity52 in front of a crowd as he looks to be in peak condition that gut - wrenching effort , while not enough to prevent @entity19 ’s hand rightly being raised at the end of 12 ferocious rounds , did create sufficient debate to justify them returning to @entity19 ’s money pit a second time			1
@entity19 is guaranteed a minimum $ 30 million , @entity17 roughly a tenth of that			1
the contentious @entity66 has explained away whatever problems he had in the first fight as a consequence of him ‘ choosing to stand and fight so i could give all the fans the thrills they want			1
boxers do not usually choose to be hit			0
the best of them withstand it heroically when it happens but they would rather be the ones doing the hitting			0
@entity19 poses with his @entity80 title belt after defeating @entity81 in 2013 @entity82 ready for title defence true or not this left the impression that he is now obliged to trade punches at times , where once he used to sashay out of touching distance like mist in the night			1
that in no way diminishes @entity19 ’s stature as one of the finest ring - craftsmen of all time but it may indicate increased vulnerability as he approaches the end of his career			2
this will the 47th fight on a so - far unblemished record and he repeats that there will be only two more , one in may and another in september next year			2
the full - frontal assault he must expect from @entity105 in the @entity106 will provide an indication of how likely he is to realise his cherished ambition of quitting as an undefeated world champion			0
in all probability he would have retired into a life of luxury already had it not been for the @entity115 television network presenting him with a six - fight contract worth at least $ 250 million and up to $ 300 million			2
so far , three down and three to go			0
@entity19 aims to defeat @entity118 again and is set to earn at least $ 30million from the re-match fight @entity19 ’s welter and light - middleweight titles are not the most valuable prizes on the line here			1
the @entity115 must go on but for that goose it to keep laying its biggest eggs he has to keep winning			0
if he can do so in a manner which convinces himself that his powers are not waning , then he may feel strong enough to reach out for the golden fleece itself – the $ 300 million super-fight against @entity132 for which the world still awaits			0
that potential epic to finish , preceded by the promised clash with our own @entity137 , would generate the maximum interest back home in @entity141			2
as usual @entity19 is the main focus for the camera bulbs as he promoted the fight in @entity2 can those legs carry @entity19 through all these challenges ? if he wants to steer clear of danger against @entity17 he will have to be at his most nimble			1
@entity148 will go for the money as hard as he can , once again			0
intriguingly , @entity19 claims he will make no technical adjustments so as to avoid being cut and bruised again			1
but then he can be as deceptive when discussing his approach to a big fight as he is clever in selling it to the pay - tv public			2
@entity132 first faces @entity155 in november but is expected to take on @entity19 after controversy has again contrived to grab world - wide interest			2
one former girl - friend is suing him for assault , while @entity19 has apologised for offering a qualified defence of a giant @entity162 footballer who was caught on film knocking out his wife in an elevator			2
then there is all the publicity about his bling - laden lifestyle			0
but behind it all works a dedicated sportsman who trains himself to the limit , in absolute readiness for the moment when the hype has to stop , the fight begin			0
the casino bookmakers here know that			0
so while he complains that his genius is under - appreciated , another @entity19 win is quoted at 2 - 15 on with @entity17 at 5 - 1 against			1
@entity19 enjoys showing off his wealth on social media , here with his pair of @entity185 cars both men say they will go for the knock - out ‘ to make a statement			1
’ while a stoppage would appear to be @entity105 ’s only realistic chance of winning			0
but if @entity19 has his dancing shoes back on i expect him to pirouette to victory on his own @entity2 stage , with the help of a stricter referee to keep the challenger ’s bull - rush tactics within the laws			1
@entity200 has been the ruination of many a great man			0
thought probably not this saturday night			0
but next year ? in one of what @entity19 insists will be his last two fights ? we will have a better idea come the early hours of sunday morning @entity208 time			2
@entity19 v @entity17 will be live late this saturday night on @entity209 .			1

@entity19 and @entity17 will meet in a *rematch* at the @entity212 in @entity2 on saturday
