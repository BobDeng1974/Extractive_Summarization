i know it makes a lot of you see @entity4			0
the idea that so many of our football shows ’ pundit chairs are seemingly warmed frequently by the backsides of so many @entity11 players			2
and if that is you , then saturday evening ’s coverage of the jewel in club football ’s crown may have just been too much to bear			2
no sooner had @entity18 got his second soaking of the afternoon - the first , from a hailstorm			0
the second , victory champagne following @entity23 ’s play - off final victory at @entity24 - than @entity25 were off to @entity26 final			1
and there , his boy @entity27 was waiting for us in @entity31			0
while alongside him , two more @entity11 men , @entity33 and @entity34			1
like the song says , they never do walk alone , do they ? having said all that , the real point is that each man is there in his own right			0
and certainly for those men on @entity25 , that worked well during their extensive build up			1
@entity34 was his chippy self from the get go			1
@entity65 , he told us ‘ borders on being a 5 - a - side player ’			0
while @entity69 is ‘ an accident waiting to happen ’			0
@entity71 delivered the one liner of the night when discussing the virtues of @entity74 as a leader			1
‘ some managers do their preparations in the mirror ’ , he said			0
but alas , he could n’t be convinced to then go on and name names			0
@entity33 was then in his pomp , breaking down and analysing tactics and formations at the big screen			1
although i have to be honest , it did seem to go on for absolutely ages without anyone else chipping in			0
perhaps they ’d all taken the chance to sneak a cheeky latte ? good to see you : @entity40 ( left ) comes into the @entity47 studio to greet former team - mate @entity49 this was their first hour of coverage , and lead just about perfectly to when @entity47 came on air			1
which they did , by the way , with an absolutely dynamite flamenco opening sequence			0
@entity102 picked up where the guitarists left off , nearly bursting with the joy of not only introducing the @entity107 captain to the game , but also the fact that he was about to ‘ get to work with @entity110 ’			1
to which @entity49 responded that is it was ‘ very exciting ’			1
only he said it with the tone of voice and body language of a man who had just been delivered blindfolded in the back of a transit van			0
however , he did quickly warm to the occasion			0
unfortunately , just at the moment when all the lads in @entity4 were suddenly upstaged by a surprise package - and yet another former member of the fold			0
glory : @entity40 celebrates after winning the trophy despite being suspended for accumulation of yellow cards this particular one , making his entrance for the evening down on the pitch , in a slick three piece suit , sunglasses and sipping on a @entity135			1
no doubt about it , the star of both channels was the suspended galactico @entity40			1
@entity36 ’s loss was telly ’s gain			1
first , he was great in the studio with the @entity25 boys			1
he talked about how well @entity148 had ‘ integrated into the club , into the city ’			0
he took @entity34 to task about @entity65 ’s contribution this season , explaining he had been ‘ outstanding ’			1
and then went on to illustrate how the @entity36 personnel would deal tactically with @entity153			2
it had @entity34 purring like a kitten and telling @entity40 how much he would be missed out there			1
all smiles : @entity40 and @entity158 celebrate the victory well , luckily , there did n’t seem to be a camera inside the @entity162 that missed him from then on in			2
@entity47 quickly got themselves in on the @entity40 lovefest - showing us the impromptu moment when he nipped in to say hello to his old team mate @entity49			1
then it was all down to the match director to use him as punctuation throughout the game			0
@entity47 were first out of the blocks in taking advantage of these candid shots			2
at half time , they stealthily attached his reaction to the replays of @entity148 ’s chance			0
and it seemed that whatever @entity40 was kicking , he was doing it much more effectively than @entity148 had just done			2
celebrating long into the night : @entity40 in @entity179 celebrating the @entity180 with fans into the second half , and we got even more @entity40 for our money			2
first , there he was hugging a team mate within an inch of his life as another chance went begging			2
then when @entity69 equalised - something happened , @entity34 , but it was n’t an accident ! - we saw a face filled with relief as it puffed out , puckered it ’s lips and kissed the top of a team mate ’s head			1
finally , he was back on the pitch trying to rally his pals for one last surge			0
and while he was there , @entity40 took time to also turn to the @entity36 fans and urge them to do the same			1
the glasses and coffee were gone by now			0
it was nitty - gritty time			0
so @entity25 saw their season off with a bang			2
while @entity47 neatly dovetailed their switch to @entity209 in a couple of weeks time by bringing the @entity212 captain on board			1
but at the end of the evening , in telly terms , it was the @entity217 who was first class .			0
