@entity0 will be hoping for 12th time lucky on sunday when he faces nemesis @entity2 of @entity3			1
the stats make unhappy reading for north @entity6			0
@entity7 ’s @entity0 has lost six , drawn five , scored six and conceded 19 against his arch rival			1
the wait for a first win goes on			0
and while the match takes centre stage , stand by for the usual sub-plot between the warring pair			0
for there is no doubt that @entity2 knows exactly how to get under the skin of @entity0 and appears to relish the opportunity to do so			1
@entity19 looks at the longest managerial feud in the @entity21			0
in the summer of 2005 the outspoken @entity32 suggested the fixture list was arranged to favour @entity7 and within a month @entity0 was questioning @entity3 ’s negative tactics			1
@entity2 ’s quote at the time : ‘ some clubs are treated as devils , some are treated as angels			2
i do n’t think we are so ugly that we should be seen as the devil and i do n’t think @entity0 and @entity41 are so beautiful that they should be seen as angels			2
’ @entity0 ’s dig : ‘ we live in a world where we only have winners and losers but once a sport encourages teams who refuse to take the initiative , the sport is in danger			2
’ the pair watch on as @entity7 face @entity3 back in december 2005 - @entity3 won the @entity21 that year @entity3 won two consecutive titles in mourinho first two seasons at @entity60 the ‘ voyeur ’ moment of all the verbal rows between @entity0 and @entity2 , this is the one which will never be forgotten			1
the @entity7 manager had criticised @entity3 ’s big spending in the autumn of 2005 and @entity2 responded furiously , labelling his rival a ‘ voyeur ’ and accusing him of being obsessed with @entity3			1
@entity2 said : ‘ he is one of these people who is a voyeur			2
he likes to watch other people			0
there are some guys who , when they are at home , have a big telescope to see what happens in other families			0
he speaks , speaks , speaks , speaks about @entity3			2
’ @entity0 hit back : ‘ i find it out of order , disconnected with reality and disrespectful			0
when you give success to stupid people , it makes them more stupid sometimes and not more intelligent			0
’ final word to @entity2 : ‘ we have a file of quotes from mr @entity0 about @entity3 in the last 12 months – it is not a file of five pages , it ’s a file of 120 pages			1
’ the pair come to blows in february 2007 as @entity2 grabs a hold of @entity7 utility man @entity97 @entity99 massacre back in february , @entity3 were one point clear of @entity7 at the top of the @entity21 table and the ceasefire between @entity0 and @entity2 was shattered after the @entity7 manager suggested his opposite number was afraid of failure			1
@entity2 hit back : ‘ he ’s a specialist in failure			0
if he is right and i am afraid of failure it is because i did n’t fail many times			0
eight years without silverware , that ’s failure			0
’ one month on and with @entity0 ’s 1,000th game on the agenda , @entity2 was offered the chance to retract but declined			1
statistics do not lie over the years @entity0 has beaten most managers but the @entity2 jinx continues and the form book would place @entity3 as the favourites on sunday			1
a quirk of the fixture list meant that @entity7 played their @entity6 rivals on @entity0 ’s 500th and 1,000th game and @entity2 emerged victorious both times			1
last season ’s landmark occasion was ruined for @entity0 as @entity3 thrashed his side 6 - 0 having conceded twice in the first seven minutes through @entity128 and @entity129			1
@entity130 ( left ) is wrongly sent off in march as @entity3 thrash @entity7 6 - 0 at @entity60 @entity131 scored from the spot after an @entity134 handball – @entity130 was sent off in a case of mistaken identity – and 10 - man @entity7 crumbled			1
@entity138 scored twice with the last goal from sub @entity140			0
absolutely @entity141 the summer of 2014 saw a fresh battleground as former @entity7 midfielder @entity143 joined @entity3 in a £ 30million move from @entity145			1
@entity2 insisted that returning to the @entity146 was ‘ not an option ’ because the @entity148 ‘ really wanted to come to @entity3 ’			2
@entity0 responded : ‘ people came out and said he wanted to go to @entity3 but i do n’t know who tells the truth here or not			2
’ @entity143 listens to his mentor @entity0 back in february 2011 @entity143 has a stroll with his new manager @entity2 at @entity3 's training ground last week back - handed compliments @entity2 was asked to say something about @entity0 ’s 1,000 game landmark earlier this year but only succeeded in muddying the waters further			1
he said : ‘ i admire him and i admire @entity7 because it ’s not possible to have 1,000 matches unless the club is also a fantastic club in the way they support the manager , especially in the bad moments – and especially when the bad moments were quite a lot			0
so i admire the manager and i admire the club			0
’ sniper ’s alley it does not seem to matter whether @entity2 is at @entity3 or not for the pair to start scrapping			1
the @entity32 was out of work when he once again turned his attention to @entity0 in 2008 and said : ‘ the @entity178 like statistics a lot			2
do they know that @entity0 has only 50 per cent of wins in the @entity178 league ? ’ a couple of years later @entity0 was calling for punishment when it appeared @entity2 ’s @entity187 had got their own players , @entity183 and @entity184 , deliberately sent off at @entity189			1
@entity0 said : ‘ there should be sanctions			0
it gives a bad image of our game			0
think , “ never do that again ” because it looks , frankly , horrible			0
’ like @entity199 's facebook page .			0

@entity0 has never beaten @entity2 in 12 *attempts*
pair have been feuding since @entity2 's first arrival in @entity178 in 2004
