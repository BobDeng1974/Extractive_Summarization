@entity0 is now tied with @entity1 in @entity2 , one of the ' firewall ' states the president hoped would protect him against defeats in @entity7 and @entity8 , according to a new poll			1
@entity10 found that @entity0 and @entity1 were tied on 49 per cent in the state , which @entity1 won in a 14 - point landslide in 2008			1
buoyed by internal polling which shows similar numbers , @entity0 is to head to @entity2 next week , as first reported by @entity15 last tuesday			1
@entity0 will be campaigning in @entity16 on monday evening			2
i will do that : @entity0 , pictured here on stage with @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , is catching up with @entity1 in surprising areas countdown : @entity0 's whirlwind tour of the country will see him go to @entity28 next week crucial : polls indicate @entity2 could become the decisive state if @entity1 holds @entity24 shining light : @entity0 would n't be wasting his time with a visit to @entity2 unless he really believed he could snatch the state from @entity1 we 're with you : @entity0 is mobbed by supporters at @entity38 @entity0 advisers believe that governor @entity41 's recall victory this year gives them an organisational edge in the state			1
in addition , representative @entity44 , @entity0 's vice-presidential running mate , is from @entity2 and the @entity1 campaign has not spent there on the negative advertising that has been so effective in @entity24			1
@entity10 , who conducted the poll of likely voters , said that @entity2 could become the decisive state in 2012 if @entity0 takes @entity7 and @entity8 - as current polling suggests - but @entity1 manages to hold out in @entity24 , where he has a wafer - thin poll lead			1
' if @entity24 goes for the president , @entity0 has a few perilous paths to victory available to him			1
all require him to carry @entity2 and its 10 @entity59 votes , ' he wrote on his website			2
' the simplest path without @entity24 would be for @entity0 to win @entity2 , @entity62 and one other swing state			1
it 's plausible , but an uphill struggle			0
' @entity1 has long believed that @entity24 , @entity66 and @entity2 is his firewall			1
even if @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity62 and @entity68 topple , victory in those three states would secure him re-election			0
now , however , that firewall is under threat			0
a @entity76 ( @entity75 ) survey released on thursday gave @entity1 a six - point lead , up from two points three weeks ago , but the @entity0 campaign points out that @entity75 is a @entity80 firm and the swing of four points towards @entity1 when almost all other trends are towards @entity0 is implausible			1
candidate time is the most precious resource for a campaign in the closing day and @entity0 's foray into @entity2 - his first since august - is an indication his team believes he has a real chance there			1
the @entity0 campaign also believes @entity1 is very vulnerable in @entity94 - a favourite state for the president because his caucuses victory there in 2008 was the first step on his road to the @entity100 - and @entity62 but in a slightly better position in @entity66			1
@entity0 is advertising in @entity2 and also @entity68 , which @entity1 won in 2008 by 10 points			1
asked last week whether @entity0 himself would be visiting @entity2 in the closing days of the race , @entity103 , a senior @entity0 adviser , said : ' yes			1
@entity44 was just in @entity106			0
we 'll be back in @entity2 , sure			2
@entity2 is definitely in play			2
' turbulence : president @entity1 takes the stage at a campaign event at @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity24 , on thursday night during his punishing campaign tour as he battles to shore up his support holding on : @entity1 believed that @entity2 was one of three states that would act as a firewall and secure him victory comfort : president @entity1 pauses to greet people as he leaves a campaign office in @entity123 , @entity124 on thursday @entity103 held out the possibility of @entity0 competing seriously not only in @entity68 and @entity2 but also in the big prizes of @entity127 and @entity128 , which @entity1 won by 17 points four years ago			1
asked about @entity127 and @entity128 , he said : ' there 's places we 're going up for the first time , ' he said			0
' we just bought @entity134 so we can beam into southern @entity68 because the battle is tightening there			0
' all i would say to that is stay tuned			0
you 've seen the polls coming out of those states			0
it does show a narrowing of the gap and we 're watching those very closely			0
' another aide predicted that @entity1 would be travelling to @entity127 to protect his turf there			0
no decision has been made within the @entity0 campaign about whether to spend money in @entity127 or send the candidate there			1
good times : the presidential candidate enjoys a laugh with @entity21 during a rendition of @entity155 at the football stadium at @entity38 fireworks : the whole face of the campaign changed after @entity0 's first debate with @entity1 that re-ignited the race in addition , the candidates have been travelling to @entity62 , where @entity1 defeated senator @entity164 by nine points in 2008 , @entity66 , where he won by 13 , @entity94 , where he won by 10 , and @entity166 , where he eked out victory by less than one per cent			1
@entity168 , the former first lady , is to campaign for @entity0 in @entity128 this weekend			2
her appearance on the campaign trail is part of a @entity0 push for female voters			2
mrs @entity168 has indicated she is in favour of abortion rights and has a much more positive image than her husband the former president @entity178			0
it also marks a foray into what has been assumed to be a safe state for @entity1			0
no @entity184 presidential candidate has won @entity128 since 1988 and president @entity178 lost @entity128 it twice even though he competed for it vigorously , especially in 2004			0
@entity0 , however , was born in @entity128 and his father was governor there			0
some polls have shown a relatively close race but @entity1 has been consistently ahead and neither campaign has spent on television advertising in the state			2
@entity1 last visited @entity128 in april while @entity0 was there in august			2
strikingly , all nine states currently being contested were won by @entity1 in 2008 and @entity0 is not having to defend any states @entity164 won			1
in addition , @entity194 , which @entity1 won by one point , has been surrendered			1
@entity1 beat @entity164 by seven points and 192 electoral college votes nationally in 2008 so @entity0 is clearly the one who needs to make up ground			1
but in a race where @entity1 was long viewed as holding an advantage in terms of the electoral map , the shift towards @entity0 is marked			2
' something structural changed in the race after that first debate and nothing has happened since to change the new structure of the race , ' @entity103 said last week			0
there are dangers , however , in attempting to expand the map			0
resources poured into @entity2 , @entity68 or @entity127 are resources taken away from @entity24 and other swing states			2
the bottom line for both the @entity0 and the @entity1 campaigns is that whoever wins @entity24 will almost certainly win the election			1
@entity219 , @entity1 's campaign manager , made clear last week he felt the election would be exceedingly close			2
' look , here 's the deal			0
this is a fight for 270 electoral college votes			0
in all the battleground states we either lead or are tied			0
it 's a very close election			0
i always told you guys it was going to be very close			0
' the election , he intimated , might very well come down to @entity24 , as it did in 2004 when president @entity178 was re-elected .			0

@entity1 won there by 14 points in 2008
@entity0 to campaign in @entity2 on tuesday
@entity1 believes @entity24 , @entity66 and @entity2 are his firewall
