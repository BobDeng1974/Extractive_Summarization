former @entity1 captain @entity0 says all @entity2 has to offer @entity4 football is a masterclass in how not to run a club			1
@entity2 was replaced as @entity10 boss by @entity11 last week following a disastrous seven - month spell in charge , during which they were relegated from the @entity14 and then left rooted to the foot of the @entity16 with one point from seven games			2
the 61 - year - old has defended his reign and told @entity23 news agency @entity21 : ' i am convinced that @entity4 football has something to learn from @entity23 qualities			0
' @entity0 takes a penalty during his @entity1 days , where he played from 2007 - 2012 and became captain but @entity0 hit back , telling @entity30 : ' all he has to offer is to show other people how not to do it			1
' @entity2 's methods have come under fierce criticism from former players , notably ex-captain @entity36 who was once told by the veteran boss to treat a leg injury by rubbing cheese onto the sore area			1
and @entity0 , a team - mate of the @entity42 defender for almost five years , revealed an even more bizarre twist to the unorthodox treatment			1
' i texted @entity36 to ask if it was true , ' he added			0
@entity2 lasted just 18 games in charge of @entity1 before being sacked by the @entity16 strugglers @entity0 has turned from player to pundit since retiring from football but could he be set for a managerial role ? ' @entity36 told me it was , and that the cheese had to be soaked in alcohol , and that he was told to phone his mother because it would help to speak to someone who loves him while the cheese is working ! ' @entity2 said of the @entity36 reports : ' i merely suggested it could be worth trying the old wives ' tale of applying quark to the injured area			1
i would never tell a doctor what to do			0
' @entity0 added : ' it 's sad that a club as stable as @entity1 is now in such a world of trouble			1
' it was a mistake to keep ( @entity75 ) in charge after they were relegated			0
the players i spoke to were desperate to get out because of him			2
' @entity0 confirms that former @entity1 captain @entity36 ( right ) , now at @entity79 , was advised to put cheese on his injured thigh to speed up the healing process by @entity2 @entity0 has expressed an interest in taking the @entity1 job , although he has not applied for it and as yet has had no contact with the @entity88 hierarchy			1
in the meantime @entity11 took charge for saturday 's clash with @entity92 , which they lost 1 - 0 , and will also be in the dug - out for tuesday night 's @entity96 third - round clash with @entity97			0
' kit 's a very good coach , ' added @entity0			2
' he took over on saturday and although they lost there were a few more smiles on people 's faces			0
