' we do have a situation where if the property had been entered he could have been found wholly unharmed ' coroner @entity75 @entity77 dr @entity76 said mr @entity4 had died from an overdose of prescription painkiller tramadol			1
he believed the time of death was three to five days before the body was found			2

he was critical of the police investigation , saying : ‘ the property could have been entered at any time from july 23 onwards			0

’ hearing : the inquest at @entity57 ( pictured ) in @entity95 was told that @entity4 , 52 , was reported missing on july 23 by a health worker after missing two appointments the @entity98 and @entity23 ’s @entity99 reviewed how the case was handled			1
both concluded there was ‘ confusion among officers ’ about the status of mr @entity4 ’s disappearance			1
' it was clear officers had not applied the force 's missing person policy correctly , that the investigation lacked ownership and consistency and that officers should have considered searching mr @entity116 ’s property earlier ' superintendent @entity117 , @entity23 the reviews said : ‘ officers did not exercise enough urgency			2

i recognise this has been a very difficult time for them and that they have lost a much - loved member of their family			0
‘ while it can not be concluded that the investigation , if managed differently , would have led to a different outcome , there is evidence that the investigation could have been concluded sooner if it had been graded appropriately			0
concerns : a coroner said it was possible the 52 - year - old could have been saved if officers from @entity23 ( whose headquarters in @entity146 are pictured ) had investigated properly ‘ it was clear officers had not applied the force ’s missing person policy correctly , that the investigation lacked ownership and consistency and that officers should have considered searching mr @entity116 ’s property earlier			1
‘ the @entity99 ( @entity156 ) investigation concluded that no individual officer or police staff member had a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct			0
‘ however , following the coroner ’s comments , @entity99 will review further what individual and organisational learning should follow			0
‘ we have also assured mr @entity4 ’s family that all officers involved in this investigation are being spoken to and given refresher training on the problem areas highlighted			2
‘ the force is reviewing policy to establish clearer guidance on the levels of risk and the correct categories of missing people , establishing clear standards of investigation for attending officers ‘ force training will support the roll - out of the amended policy			2
the force is determined to learn the lessons of this case and we will incorporate the coroner ’s findings into the review of how we deal with missing people in future			0
