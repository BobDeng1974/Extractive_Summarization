pastor and father - of - two @entity0 set the bar high when he was bestowed with a ' @entity3 ' six weeks ago : he planned to eat at the restaurant each day , twice a day			1
it 's a challenge that might have defeated even the most voracious eaters but mr @entity0 , from @entity7 , is on track - eating 95 meals at @entity9 over the past six weeks			1
and with the pass costing just $ 100 , the @entity9 fan has already made his money back 15 times over - but insisted he has not gained any weight			1
mr @entity0 considers himself something of a celebrity at his local @entity9 in @entity18 , where he chows down a bowl of pasta for lunch and dinner - with extra cheese - each day			1
he greets those steaming pasta entrees with the words : ' hello friend			0
' but the pastor dreams big , telling @entity43 : ' i would love to be the person that ate the most of the 1,000 people			0
that would be a good contest to win			0
because that means i got the most value out of the card of anyone in the @entity55			0
' when he bought the pass back in september , he told the news station that he did n't mind if he put on weight because of the money he would have saved			0
mr @entity0 said that he had n't had enough of pasta yet but by the end of the seven weeks , he would probably want a burger or pizza			2
only 1,000 of the passes were made available and covered a 150 combinations of pasta and sauce at the @entity70 food chain mr @entity0 knows exactly how many bowls of pasta he has consumed over six weeks as he has kept every receipt from the challenge it was a carb - loading dream when @entity9 announced the ' never - ending pasta pass ' in september - which sold out in 45 minutes			1
the $ 100 golden ticket has allowed @entity9 fans to fill up on as much of the chain 's signature dishes as they can eat			1
fans of the chain were able to buy a ticket to eat as much pasta as possible for seven weeks between september 22 and november 9			1
only 1,000 of the passes were sold and covered the 150 combinations of pasta and sauce available at @entity9			2
the deal also includes unlimited soft drinks for the pass - holder and those at their table - but no alcohol			2
the pass can be used as many times as the user wants throughout the seven - week period at @entity9 locations across the @entity55 the pastor tucks into another bowl at his local @entity9 with the words : ' hello , friend ' the attention - grabbing promo has come at a tricky time for the chain			1
in july , the ceo and chairman @entity107 stepped down as the @entity109 company fights to fix its flagship @entity9 chain following its contested sale of @entity113			0
the company , based in @entity115 , @entity116 , has been pressured to turn around declining sales at @entity9 and @entity113			0
customers had begun turning away from those chains as they cut back on spending during the recession			0
@entity109 completed the sale of @entity113 to investment firm @entity122 in july			0
there has also been concern from diners over the calorie contents of those bottomless pasta bowls			0
@entity9 boasts a significant amount of meals that have more calories , saturated fat and sodium than is recommended - and even more than a @entity134 's value meal , according to a @entity137 - @entity136 study in january			2
all you can eat : the pass has allowed the diner to eat as many pasta dishes as they want from the @entity9 chain over a seven - week period the father - of - two has been his twice daily portions of pasta at @entity9 in @entity18 , @entity7			1

@entity0 from @entity18 , @entity7 , has eaten 95 bowls of pasta over the past six weeks after getting a seven - week pass
he has eaten $ 1,500 worth of food - making back 15 times the cost of his $ 100 pass
the father - of - two plans to continue eating @entity9 twice a day until the deal runs out on november 9
