three in four @entity1 women would choose a man with love handles over one sporting a six - pack			1
that 's 23 million of us who find muscular men a turn off ; 96 % predict a date with an abs - obsessed bloke to be positively dreary			1
these stats are the result of a study commissioned to mark the @entity16 release of @entity17 , a film featuring numerous shirtless scenes of actors @entity19 ( in the flab corner ) and @entity22 ( in the abs )			1
did they audition chubby men for the highly anticipated film of @entity42 ? i do n't think so			1
we will ogle , we will fantasise			0
but when it comes to real life , we do n't want chiselled perfection in our bed			2
the question is : why on earth not ? why do n't women want some hot , buff , perfect - bodied man lying beside us ? the sad answer is this : we 're worried we wo n't shape up			1
seventy - four percent of women in the survey said they 'd feel self - conscious taking their clothes off in front of a perfectly toned man			1
a he - man 's discipline highlights our lack of it , making us feel even more acutely self - conscious of our own body flaws than usual			2
@entity65 says we avoid relationships with fitter men because we do n't believe we can live up to their standards we feel far more comfortable with flab because it 's less threatening			1
women are already under extreme pressure to look a certain way and be a certain weight			1
anyone who ever doubted that women are judged by their physical appearance far more than men , need only have witnessed the media coverage of the unveiling of @entity83 's female mp 's : nearly all of it focused on what they wore and what they look like			1
it takes robust self - esteem and an unshakeable body image to stay objective about our weight in a society where the body ideal is so unachievable , even models struggle to maintain it			2
is it any wonder women figure - usually quite rightly - that a man who is less critical of his own appearance and less looks - obsessed will be less critical of ours ? mr @entity100 is a relief to any woman who steps on the scales , every day of her life , and finds her mood is affected , every day of her life , by what they say			1
especially when it comes to sex			0
i 'd love to meet a female whose sex life is n't affected by a ' fat day '			1
i 've yet to meet one man who has let feeling fat stop them having sex			1
@entity65 says that when it comes to sex , women are far more concerned about weight than men @entity121 , the author of ' not tonight dear , i feel fat ' , says fifty percent of women admit they 've put off sex - even when they 're in the mood - because they felt too fat			1
' women put conditions on sex because of weight			1
you wo n't do it without cover - up clothing			0
you only have sex with the lights out			0
you 'll only do positions that prevent your partner from looking at or touching certain parts of your body , ' he says			0
' pretty soon your desire for any sex , conditional or not , goes away			2
' we do n't just think our partners wo n't desire us unless we are thin			2
we do n't feel desirable unless we are thin			0
there are many ( many ) things men can learn from women , but this is one area where women can learn from men			2
when men look in the mirror , they look at the parts of themselves that they like			0
i showed four male friends the publicity stills of the ab - tastic @entity22 and they all shrugged and said , ' he looks good			0
but he 's paid to look like that			0
' they made no comparison to themselves			0
there was no subconscious sucking in of their beer belly			0
no wistful glance at their not - so - bulging biceps			0
when women look in the mirror , they hone in on the bits they do n't like			2
show us a picture of @entity176 in a bikini and we think ' why do n't i look like that ? i better not eat anything else for the rest of the day and hit the gym after work '			0
it 's a continuing double standard that 's not working for anyone - men or women			2
we should all be more @entity19 - like : learn to love our bellies and accept that wobbly bits are all part of being mere mortals			0

*sexpert* @entity195 reveals why so many women are choosing flab over abs
she says sadly it is because we are *insecure* about our weight
women worry that they ca n't live up to the *expectations* of a fitter man
@entity65 adds that men tend to not let weight affect their desire for sex
