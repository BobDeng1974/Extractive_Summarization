by @entity0 @entity2 @entity1 died when he fell into the gorge while ' escaping ' from other soldiers during a training exercise a @entity6 died during a gruelling @entity8 selection exercise when he fell into a mountain gorge which should have been out of bounds			1
but an inquest heard that the hazard ’s name was written in @entity14 on a military map – and no one realised the danger			1
commando @entity1 fell into the 100ft gorge as he tried to reach a safe point while ‘ escaping ’ from other soldiers as part of the night - time training mission			1
a coroner yesterday said the 25 - year - old ’s death was ‘ clearly avoidable ’ in a damning finding for military chiefs			1
despite recording a verdict of accidental death , she criticised the organisers of the training mission who had failed to notice the danger			1
on the planning map used to brief troops before the exercise , the word ‘ gorge ’ was in its @entity14 translation – ‘ ceunant ’ – so none of the commanders had realised it was a hazard			1
coroner @entity40 said : ‘ had the gorge been identified in the recce [ reconnaissance ] procedure it would have been out of bounds and he would n’t have been there.the failure to identify this gorge as an unduly hazardous location is clearly the most significant contributing factor to @entity1 slipping and falling			1
’ acknowledging that lessons had been learned by the military , she went on to say : ‘ crucially , there will be more attempts to gain local specialist knowledge of unacceptable hazards on training grounds in future			2
’ one @entity60 soldier , who was giving evidence from behind a screen to protect his identity , told the inquest that the @entity8 now study real - image internet maps before exercises			0
he said : ‘ we are quite proud of our map - reading ability			1
on this occasion that ability was n’t good enough			0
’ @entity71 , of @entity72 , @entity73 , was killed while taking part in exercises to join an elite @entity8 unit believed to be the @entity60			0
he was part of a team climbing in the notoriously inhospitable area to test their ‘ ability to adapt and survive ’ in extreme conditions			0
@entity71 volunteered to lead a team through the mountainous region while attempting to ‘ evade capture ’ from other soldiers			0
an inquest heard how they had limited equipment for the night - time drill , including a map with ‘ little detail ’ of the area			1
@entity71 looked at the terrain on @entity94 where he saw the gorge – but identified it as a small riverbed rather than a 100ft drop			1
rugged : the military exercise was held in the mountainous region of @entity101 , @entity102 seconds after telling his colleagues ‘ mind your footing ’ , he plummeted into @entity108 in @entity101 , @entity102			1
the drop was not shown on their scale map of the area			2
when his comrades reached their colleague he was drifting in and out of consciousness and had a weak pulse			0
a few minutes later he stopped breathing			0
his comrades carried out cpr on him until a rescue helicopter arrived and he was rushed to @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity102 , where he died			0
one of the troops , who can not be named , described the level of risk on the exercise , which took place in october 2012 , as ‘ acceptable ’			2
but another said the hazardous area would have been placed ‘ out of bounds ’ had they known about the steep - sided gorge			2
last summer three @entity132 soldiers died in a gruelling @entity60 selection exercise on the hottest day of the year			2
they collapsed with heat exhaustion while taking part in the notorious ‘ @entity138 ’ march in the @entity137			0
@entity139 , a military injuries lawyer , said : ‘ once again the @entity141 has found itself facing serious questions about whether it is properly protecting its soldiers			0
‘ we have seen time and time again alarming examples which point to unacceptable shortcomings in military practice and a consistent failure by the @entity141 to observe the duty of care it owes its soldiers			0
‘ we need to know whether this is another			0
soldiers should not die on exercise			2
’ @entity6 @entity158 ’s parents declined to comment after the inquest .			1

@entity6 @entity1 fell down gorge during exercise in rugged @entity14
