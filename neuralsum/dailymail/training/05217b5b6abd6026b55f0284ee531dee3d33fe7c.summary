by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is the only player who controls his @entity4 destiny , but it was @entity6 who did most to boost his chances of making the @entity10 team in the @entity11			1
on the course where he started playing golf aged eight , @entity6 carded a flawless six - under - par 66 at @entity15 to share the lead with @entity18 's @entity17			1
and that meant @entity2 , who needs to finish in the top two to overtake @entity21 and claim the final automatic qualifying place , found himself six shots off the pace following an erratic opening 72			1
@entity11 : after impressing at the @entity11 , @entity6 may be selected as a wildcard option @entity10 captain @entity27 admitted @entity6 is ' very much in my mind ' for one of the three wild cards he will announce on tuesday , with the man himself thinking he needs to win on sunday to make a third consecutive cup appearance at @entity34 next month			1
' i had a chat with @entity27 when he got here and i think the good thing is that he knows what i can bring to the team because he has seen me as vice-captain on the last two teams , ' said @entity6 , whose halved match with @entity43 at @entity44 in 2012 ensured @entity10 won outright for the seventh time in the last nine contests			1
' but it 's up to me to prove that i really want it and am playing well enough			0
i think anything less than a win would not be enough so i have to aim for that			0
' @entity2 headed straight to the range after a round featuring four birdies and four bogeys , the 39 - year - old @entity53 squandering a good start after almost holing his approach to his second hole of the day			2
leader : @entity6 carded a flawless six - under - par 66 at @entity15 to share lead with @entity17 ' i 'm a bit disappointed because i threw away a couple of shots midway through my round , but it 's okay for the first day and i am only one good score away from the top of the leaderboard , ' said @entity2 , who lives just 35 miles from @entity34			1
' i know i have to finish first or second , that 's not going to change , so i 'm not putting any pressure on myself			0
once you get out on the course you just try to birdie every hole			0
that 's the easy part			0
it 's when you finish you think about the @entity4			2
' @entity27 said that even if nothing significant happened this week that he had not settled upon his three wild cards , with five players - thought to be @entity2 , @entity6 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 - the favourites			1
' something will happen and there are a lot of permutations , ' @entity27 added after a bogey on the last gave him an opening 73			2
' my selections wo n't be a surprise , it wo n't be coming out of left field			0
i will be going by logic			0
@entity6 has played very well today and is very much in my mind			2
' destiny : @entity97 will automatically qualify for the @entity4 team if he can finish inside the top six the lack of a ' left - field ' selection would appear to rule out @entity17 , who finished 15th in the @entity101 after playing in the last group in the final round alongside eventual winner @entity104			1
@entity17 was fourth in the @entity105 at @entity34 last year and also lost a five - man play - off in the same event in 2011 , but said : ' i think @entity2 should get a pick for the way he has played this year			2
' @entity111 ( @entity27 ) knows i play well at @entity34 and i like the course , but i am pretty far down the list ( 23rd ) and even if i win it would be a surprise to get that call on tuesday , ' he said			0
' the first three days at @entity117 gave me a lot of confidence knowing i could get into that position and be in the last group in a major			0
i probably should have tried to make more of a move in the final round but i did n't drive the ball that well that day and could n't really get it going			0
options : @entity27 has a number of options available to him for his three wildcard slots ' it was actually the first time i have had a really good performance in @entity133 as well so it was a big , big week for me and a pretty cool experience to be out so late on a sunday in a major			1
' @entity17 and @entity6 enjoyed a one - shot lead over @entity133 @entity136 , @entity138 's @entity137 , @entity140 's @entity139 , @entity142 's @entity141 and @entity144 @entity143 , with 17 - year - old @entity146 amateur @entity145 among a seven - strong group another shot back			1
@entity140 's @entity148 , an outside chance for a wild card following his win in @entity152 a fortnight ago , carded a three - under - par 69 to finish alongside fellow hopeful @entity153 .			0

@entity6 playing himself into @entity4 contention at @entity146 open
@entity10 captain @entity27 said @entity6 was ' very much ' in contention
@entity2 can still grab automatic qualification
@entity81 , @entity80 , @entity79 are other wildcard options
