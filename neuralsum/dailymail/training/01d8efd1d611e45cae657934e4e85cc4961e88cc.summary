job done , move on			0
@entity1 avoided a potential banana skin by running in six tries against a hopelessly underpowered @entity5 side but will wake up this morning knowing there is much work to do ahead of their visit to @entity10 in a fortnight			2
@entity12 made no attempt to mask his disappointment after seeing his side concede three tries — the first inside four minutes when @entity18 bulldozed over and the last just seconds from the end when @entity20 brushed past @entity21 — and the @entity1 coach acknowledged improvements must be made to claim victory over pre-tournament favourites @entity24			1
‘ if you had said to me before the game we would get 47 points i would have taken it but there was a soft try first up and a soft try at the end , ’ @entity12 said			1
‘ i was disappointed we did n’t get the same level of intensity throughout the 80 minutes			0
’ @entity12 was right to be disappointed			0
@entity1 did plenty of good things in this game , most notably another world - class contribution from @entity81 ’s livewire centre @entity56 , but they were painfully slow out of the blocks once again while their defence was alarmingly porous at times			1
mercifully , they avoided serious injury but spare a thought for @entity86 , who will wake up this morning with the sorest head in the team , regardless of how muted the celebrations were , after a sickening early collision with @entity91			1
the unconscious @entity1 full back required almost 10 minutes of treatment on the ground before being taken from the field on a stretcher after being given oxygen			1
he reappeared later on the touchline showing no outward signs of damage , but following hard on the heels of @entity105 ’s overlooked double concussion last week , it was the last thing the player , or the sport , needed			0
@entity66 touches down beside the posts for @entity1 's first try of the second half and their third try of the match @entity56 leaps over the line and scores a second try for @entity1 as @entity12 's side took control in the first half @entity1 xv : @entity86 ; @entity119 , @entity56 , @entity120 , may ; @entity121 , @entity122 ; @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 ; @entity126 , @entity127 ; @entity128 , @entity129 ( capt ) , @entity131 replacements : @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity44 , @entity139 tries : @entity141 , @entity56 ( 2 ) , @entity142 , @entity44 , @entity136 conversions : @entity144 ( 3 ) , @entity44 ( 1 ) penalties : @entity144 ( 3 ) , @entity37 xv : @entity146 ; @entity147 , @entity20 , @entity91 , @entity148 ; @entity149 , @entity150 ; @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity18 replacements : @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 tries : @entity18 , @entity20 ( 2 ) conversion : @entity169 ( 1 ) @entity1 , forced to keep warm as medics attended their stricken team - mate , were clearly shaken by @entity86 ’s 13th - minute injury — caused as he bravely dived to avert @entity91 gathering @entity174 ’s chip ahead — and it was 21 minutes before @entity121 got them on the scoreboard with his first penalty			1
with @entity1 having to come from behind once again , as they did in @entity179 last weekend , @entity12 and his coaching team admitted there was cause for concern			2
‘ we ’re all delighted with the result , ’ @entity12 added			2
‘ we know we ’ve made progress but we know to beat @entity24 in @entity24 we ’re going to have to step up again			0
’ @entity86 ’s exit forced @entity186 to reshuffle his back line and the @entity1 coach opted to bring on @entity139 and shift @entity119 to full back , with @entity56 moving to the wing rather than make the straight swap of bringing @entity44 on at full back			1
it proved an inspired decision as @entity139 resumed his partnership of 12 months ago with @entity120 to produce one of his best games in an @entity1 shirt			0
no 8 @entity200 barged over from a 24th - minute lineout peel and , despite television replays proving inconclusive , the television match official awarded the try and @entity1 were finally up and motoring			1
@entity56 ’s first try , courtesy of a superb @entity129 turnover in midfield , saw the @entity81 flyer skip outside @entity174 ’s tackle before bamboozling @entity147 with some darting footwork and electric acceleration to purr in from the halfway line			0
it was such a high - class finish , some in the crowd compared it with @entity216 in his pomp			0
‘ we assess every player ’s performance throughout the season and we ’ve scored them on a weekly basis , ’ @entity12 added			2
‘ @entity56 , of all our centres , has been top - ranked			2
as the season has gone on his case for inclusion has become overwhelming on his club form			0
’ @entity56 escapes the clutches of @entity37 's @entity147 as he makes a break for the try line before scoring @entity1 's second try @entity56 is congratulated by his @entity1 team - mates after putting the home side firmly in control of the @entity236 clash @entity200 is adjudged to have grounded the ball to touch down for @entity1 's opening try after consultation with the video referee @entity121 got @entity1 's first points on the board as he struck a penalty between the posts after @entity37 had taken an early lead @entity1 's @entity86 was knocked out after a crushing collision with @entity91 resulting in a long stoppage in play @entity86 is smashed to the ground following the collision as the @entity1 full back was visiblly unconcious medics tend to @entity86 after the collision and there was a long break in play , which interrupted @entity37 's momentum @entity86 left the field on a stretcher as he is given oxygen - it was later revealed that the full back had regained conciousness three years after making his debut as a 20 - year - old before being told to go away and work on his defence , @entity56 , who also scored against @entity264 last week , has been @entity1 ’s outstanding player in the first two games			1
his second try , 61 minutes in , again demonstrated his keen eye for space and electric pace			0
he has added another dimension to @entity1 ’s attacking play			2
‘ we felt @entity56 needed to work on his defence and his management of the wide breakdowns , ’ @entity12 said			2
‘ that ’s really come on but also his confidence and his presence in the team			0
he ’s shown himself as a real leader in the team			0
that ’s grown on the back of good work at @entity81			0
’ @entity37 had a chance to claw their way back but two @entity174 missed penalties deflated the visitors , who should have been dead and buried by half - time only for @entity21 to bomb a straightforward try when he ignored a two - man overlap after 36 minutes			1
it could cost the @entity296 wing his place			0
after going in 18 - 5 up , the second half proved more straightforward for @entity1 — bar a couple of well taken tries from @entity20 — after @entity66 scuttled over from a quickly taken tap penalty on 55 minutes			1
@entity56 ’s brilliant second try , after some smart work from @entity200 , @entity66 , @entity139 and @entity144 , made it 33 - 10 before replacement @entity44 — making a welcome return to @entity38 seven years after his last appearance — started and finished a sweeping move down the left			1
fellow replacement @entity41 finished the try - scoring for the hosts when the 36 - year - old became the oldest @entity1 try scorer of all time , only for @entity20 to leave a sour taste with his late score			1
as school reports go , it was a case of could do better			0
to beat @entity24 in two weeks , @entity1 will have to			2
@entity37 's @entity18 goes over the line and touches down the first try as the visitors take the lead in the first few minutes @entity1 captain @entity129 prepares to release the ball as he goes to ground under a flurry of bodies @entity129 climbs highest to take the line - out under the lights at @entity38 as @entity1 made it two wins from two @entity139 watches from afar as @entity1 and @entity37 packs engage in a scrummage @entity1 skipper @entity129 shakes hands with a bruised and battered @entity156 after the match at @entity334			1

@entity1 beat @entity37 47 - 17 at @entity38 as @entity12 's side kept up winning record in @entity236
the visitors took a *surprise* early lead when @entity18 touched down after just four minutes
there was a long break in play as @entity86 received treatment before leaving on a stretcher after a hard hit
@entity86 collided with @entity37 centre @entity91 and appeared to be knocked out following the collision
@entity200 and @entity56 touched down in quick *succession* after a @entity121 penalty
@entity121 *kicked* over the first points of the second half before @entity20 touched down for @entity37 's second try
@entity66 , @entity56 and @entity44 , and @entity41 added further tries for @entity1 as they ran out *comfortable* winners
@entity20 *muscled* his way over in the right corner to add a late *consolation* try for the @entity37
