by @entity1 reporter some enterprising vagrants are turning @entity4 's @entity3 into a rent - free residence using only plywood and ingenuity			1
as rents rise in @entity9 and working professionals fork out a fortune to live in @entity3 shoeboxes , homeless @entity4 are living the city life gratis			1
according to real estate appraiser @entity16 and brokerage @entity18 , the median monthly rent in the previously affordable borough of @entity9 is $ 2,900 , a record high and only marginally cheaper than @entity3			1
prime real estate : the dwellings are built into the upper deck of the bridge , below car traffic but above the subway admittedly the dwellings , narrow spaces just big enough for one person to lie down , are cramped , but they provide shelter for people who otherwise have to brave the elements			1
the @entity31 reports that one bridge - dweller , a middle - aged @entity34 man , locks his plywood ' door ' with a bicycle lock each morning and returns for the evening to sleep			2
to reach the dwelling , which is built into the bridge frame on the @entity3 side of the bridge , he climbs a chain - link fence			1
last sunday a cyclst saw the man climbing to his rustic nook and mistook him for a jumper , calling 911 to report what he thought was an impending suicide			0
he was yanked off the fence by police and questioned , finally managing to convey in his limited @entity52 that he was n't trying to jump , but was merely returning home			0
prime location : the @entity3 bridge links the city with @entity9 's @entity58 neighborhood ' people are really desperate for places to stay			1
i say , if he ’s not bothering anybody , he ’s not bothering me			0
leave him alone , ' @entity64 , a passerby riding her bike near the shantytown told the @entity31			0
the pods are built into the underside of the upper deck of the bridge , below car traffic and above the subway			2
each 10.5 - foot - long space is big enough for a sleeping mat and some personal items			2
there 's no bathroom or kitchen , but it 's a place to call home			0
and for some down - on - their - luck @entity4 , that 's priceless .			0

homeless people are *constructing* dwellings in the @entity3
using plywood , vagrants are *converting* narrow spaces on the underside of the bridge to sleeping nooks
