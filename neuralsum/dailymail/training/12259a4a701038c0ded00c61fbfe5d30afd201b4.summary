it has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern - day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient @entity3			1
but new research shows that the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes			0
neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred , meaning @entity14 now have roughly 2 per cent @entity3 dna			1
scientists at @entity17 have shown that the genetic similarity between @entity3 and @entity20 modern human populations must have arisen after interbreeding in @entity14 and @entity21 these ' legacy ' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history			1
however , it is not all bad news , as other genes we inherited from our species ' early life could have improved our immunity to diseases which were common at the time , helping us to survive			0
however scientists looking into the neanderthal genome believe their dna could also have made us more resistant to ancient diseases , helping us to evolve speaking to @entity45 , professor @entity41 , research leader in human origins at the @entity43 in @entity44 , said : neanderthals had been evolving outside of @entity47 of thousands of years and had been exposed to diseases which our species had not come into contact with			0
' studies have shown we could have taken part of our @entity54 system , which effects our white blood cells , from them			0
' we got a quick fix to our own immune system by breeding with @entity3 which helped us to survive			0
' studies have also already been published which show that humans outside of @entity47 are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes , and that is because we bred with @entity3 , while those who stayed inside @entity47 did n't			1
' the @entity54 system helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign bodies when they enter the system			0
last year researchers from @entity69 and @entity70 universities announced that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer had been discovered in the neanderthal genome , and last month @entity75 published a paper from @entity77 suggesting that a gene which can cause diabetes in @entity80 came from @entity3			1
by examining the genes found in the toe bone of a female @entity3 , scientists have been able to build up a more complete version of early human history and how modern - humans evolved			1
analysis of the dna found that @entity3 families were highly interbred , both among themselves , and among other early humans such as @entity90			2
the research potentially suggests that @entity3 became extinct not because early humans killed them , but because they bred with them and incorporated their dna into the much larger human population			2
last year researchers from @entity69 and @entity70 universities announced that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer had been discovered in the neanderthal genome next month the @entity43 will stage an exhibition , @entity100 : one million years of the @entity101 , describing @entity102 , an early human species that first populated @entity100 about 900,000 years ago , and displaying life - size models of @entity3 , a later species			1
neanderthals may not , however , be the only contributors to modern human dna			0
new studies suggest that during one period , between 100,000 - 500,000 years ago , there were up to seven species of early human alive at the same time			2
people from @entity47 , have @entity39 suspected to come from @entity114 - the @entity115 - a primitive ancestor , while some @entity21 groups carry dna from the @entity90 .			0

humans wiped out @entity3 around 30,000 years ago
however the two co-existed for thousands of years and interbred
modern @entity14 have around 2 per cent @entity3 dna
those genes have been linked to high risk from cancer and diabetes
