@entity0 and @entity1 have been thrown @entity3 lifelines after receiving surprise call - ups for @entity7 's @entity6 training squad ahead of next month 's @entity9 tournament			1
the sale fly - half and veteran @entity12 8 were not set to be included this weekend , but a change of thinking following a selection meeting on monday has seen them named in a 34 - man squad which will train together before the opening clash with @entity18 on february 6			2
@entity0 , 27 , in outstanding form this season , is one of four fly - halves in the squad - which does not contain injured stars @entity24 ( groin ) , @entity26 ( ankle ) , @entity28 ( neck ) and @entity30 ( ankle ) - with @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 also named			1
@entity1 , who will be 37 by the time the @entity3 begins in september , has not played for @entity6 since the @entity97 , but has also been rewarded for his excellent club form			1
' @entity0 has n't been far away at all since the @entity47 tour and he was in camp in august , ' said @entity7			1
' he 's improved his game and worked hard and we want to create an opportunity for him to come in and put a marker down alongside @entity34			2
' with @entity30 's injury we need two specialist @entity106 and @entity1 has been outstanding this season			1
' we base a lot of our decisions on training and we have a very competitive squad			2
we have a two - week period to prepare and we will use that time wisely			0
' @entity1 's last appearance in an @entity6 shirt was the @entity97 quarter - final defeat by @entity117 @entity118 ( left ) chips a grubber kick past @entity60 fly half @entity81 last satuday forwards @entity121 ( @entity122 ) , @entity123 ( @entity55 ) , @entity124 ( @entity125 ) , @entity127 - @entity126 ( @entity128 ) , @entity129 ( @entity128 ) , @entity130 ( @entity51 ) , @entity131 ( @entity43 ) , @entity132 ( @entity63 ) , @entity133 ( @entity84 ) , @entity134 ( @entity60 ) , @entity135 ( @entity51 ) , @entity136 ( @entity128 ) , a @entity137 ( @entity125 ) , @entity138 ( @entity51 ) backs @entity140 ( @entity63 ) , @entity141 ( @entity51 ) , @entity142 ( @entity60 ) , @entity143 ( @entity51 ) , @entity144 ( @entity125 , captain ) , @entity146 ( @entity147 ) , @entity148 ( @entity60 ) , @entity149 ( @entity128 ) , @entity150 ( @entity12 ) , @entity151 ( @entity60 ) commenting on his inclusion in the @entity6 @entity153 , @entity0 said , ' i am delighted to have been given the opportunity to join up with the squad next week and look forward to training with them and developing my game			1
' it 's a great chance for me to prove myself and hopefully get a chance to represent my country again			2
i would like to thank everyone at @entity43 for helping me make this happen			1
' @entity55 's uncapped lock @entity165 is included – in place of the injured @entity26 - in a squad which also contains six returning @entity168 – @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173			1
@entity174 will captain the side through the @entity9 despite concerns over a shoulder injury			0
' looking at both squads it 's obvious there is a lot of depth and competition in every position , which is what we want			0
many players are putting their hand up in the @entity189 and @entity190 and they have a chance to impress in training as we build towards the games against @entity18 and the @entity195			0
' it 's great to welcome back some of those players unavailable for the @entity198 in the autumn			0
they offer us a lot of quality and experience			0
so too @entity1 , who has played well for @entity12 and , with the injury to @entity30 , both he and @entity206 in the @entity207 will provide us with specialist no 8 options alongside @entity210			1
that 's something we feel we need going into the tournament			0
@entity51 fly half @entity32 ( left ) is set to start for @entity6 against @entity18 with @entity33 on the bench ' we have plenty of players to consider and with some players still being assessed from last weekend after suffering knocks we have kept our options open			1
' it 's a big @entity190 weekend ahead and there may be further changes once we assess the fitness of the players after round six and we will provide an update on monday			0
' rugby - league convert @entity228 is named in the @entity207 squad to face the @entity195 in @entity230 on january			0
' we 're really pleased with his progress , ' said attack coach @entity40			0
' there will be a lot of ups and downs and it 's a steep learning curve but for him to be involved with the @entity207 is great for him			0
' @entity6 will welcome back a host of players for the @entity9 including @entity172 ( left ) and @entity173			2

@entity0 has been recalled for his *superb* form with @entity43
@entity1 has not featured for @entity6 since the @entity97
@entity245 's *hot* streak for @entity51 means he is *retained* in the squad
@entity30 and @entity28 will miss the entire *championship*
@entity24 and @entity26 are major injury *doubts*
