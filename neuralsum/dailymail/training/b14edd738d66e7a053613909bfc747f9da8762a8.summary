by @entity0 a pair of high school students on @entity3 have been suspended indefinitely after bringing a @entity5 flag to school			1
the two seniors at @entity8 in @entity9 came to school wearing the flag over their shoulders at an after - hours sporting event , said the school 's principal , brother @entity14			1
' the @entity18 - @entity17 students who immediately saw it really exercised heroic restraint and fortunately a teacher immediately confiscated the flag and took the students out of the gym , ' he told @entity25			2
two students have been permanently suspended for wearing a @entity5 flag to school while @entity14 initially suspended them for 10 days he has since changed his mind to make the punishment indefinite			1
@entity14 wrote a letter to the unnamed student 's parents saying that any symbol ' designed to revive past injustices or to inflame discrimination or racial intolerance , is completely unacceptable and profoundly offensive , ' according to @entity39			1
he called the flag a symbol of hate			2
' i find it just very hard to even imagine why any student in 2014 would even consider or think that a @entity5 flag would be anything other than a symbol of hate , ' he said			2
' it 's absolutely absurd , ' she said			0
' i do n't understand why you would bring up things from the past that are hateful			0
' the sentiment was echoed by parent @entity56			0
brother @entity14 said he considered the flag hate speech ' it represents slavery to us , ' she said			1
' it represents racism and prejudice to us			0
believe me , i am all for freedom of speech but to have someone come in to school with that flag draped around their shoulder -- i 'm not really sure what the intent was			2
' @entity14 said hate speech would not be protected by freedom of speech			1
' i certainly think this particular symbol of hate falls in the category of something that should be excised from our culture , ' he said			0
as @entity83 's is a private catholic school it is not bound by @entity86 rights			1
while the suspension was initially only set for ten days , @entity14 said tensions in the school were so high it was best they not return at all the students have not explained their intent			1
however , they still have the backing of the @entity94			0
' our motto is more speech , not censorship or punishment , ' said @entity94 director @entity100			0
' helping children understand the impact of this patently expressive activity			0
' but with tensions running high and the principal having security concerns about a return , he said they wo n't be coming back at all if he has his way .			0
