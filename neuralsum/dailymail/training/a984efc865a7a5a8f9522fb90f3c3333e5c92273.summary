published : 06:33 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 06:34 est , 5 september 2013 a bold plan to breath new life into @entity3 's ailing space industry has been unveiled with a futuristic spaceport designed to cope with increased demand from thrill - seeking tourists			1
the city announced yesterday that it had applied for a licence to build the @entity10 ' latest and biggest spaceport , and has already drawn up a detailed proposal of what the state - of - the - art facility would look if it gets the green light			2
the spaceport , which would be built on a 450 - acre site that is currently home to the @entity10 military and @entity19 operations at @entity20 , would include a sleek passenger terminal and an aviation museum			0
lift off : @entity3 has applied to build the latest spaceport in a bid to enter the commercial space race @entity26 , director of @entity3 's @entity27 , said the spaceport would provide tourism from a terminal similar to airports , where people would board and take off much as they would an aeroplane			1
but , according to the @entity34 , when the aircraft arrived over the @entity36 , it would head straight up and give passengers a tour of outer space , before returning to earth and landing at the spaceport			0
the plan also includes providing accommodation for reusable launch vehicles , facilities to build space vehicles , training facilities for astronauts , and the ability to launch microsatellites			0
mr @entity26 said : ' how does the city dubbed " @entity3 " hold onto the title in the 21st century ? we think this is the answer : the @entity3 spaceport			1
' mr @entity26 added with @entity3 's history of involvement in the space industry , it was natural that the city would want to build the latest space port			1
the city received a double body blow in 2011 when first the space shuttle fleet was retired , and then @entity19 decided to contract out future space station work to private companies			0
although @entity3 remains home to more than 50 aerospace contract companies , the city has suffered the fallout from job losses			2
futuristic : the spaceport would allow flights for space tourists , and would also provide facilities for commercial operations the full cost of the spaceport has not yet been calculated , but mr @entity26 said the application process with the @entity81 could take up to 15 months			2
if it is granted the licence it would hope the spaceport would be operational within five to 10 years			1
it could be paid for by a combination of funds from the private sector , city bonds and federal grants			0
@entity3 mayor @entity91 said : ' this is a new and exciting sector of the 21st century economy that carries amazing potential for growth			1
' we believe a licensed spaceport in @entity3 would not only serve as an economic generator for the city but it would also enhance @entity3 's well - deserved reputation as a leader and key player in the aerospace industry			1
' there are currently eight licensed spaceports in the @entity10 , including facilities in @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110			0
eight other locations , including @entity3 , are in various stages of development			0
other areas in @entity115 working on spaceport proposals include @entity117 and @entity118 .			0

@entity3 enters commercial space race with bold plan for new spaceport
the city is *fighting* back to remain ' @entity3 ' in the 21st century
if granted the licence , it hopes the spaceport is operational in 10 years
