@entity7 , of @entity8 , has officially been a full - time single dad since @entity9 last year			1
however his battle to win back his son , three - year - old @entity11 , has taken three years and cost him almost everything he has			1
in 2008 , @entity7 was recruited to play running back and receiver for @entity16 , a small public university in southeast @entity17 , where he met his girlfriend , @entity13 reported			1
worth the fight : @entity7 , 26 , now has full custody of his son , @entity20 , 3 ' i was n't looking to settle down or anything like that , ' he said			1
' we both understood it was n't serious			0
' in december 2009 , after not seeing him for a few weeks , the girlfriend came to his house with an opened box of pregnancy tests and disappeared into the bathroom to take one , @entity7 said			1
when she came out , she showed him the positive result			0
@entity7 said they needed to go to a doctor but she refused , causing him to doubt her pregnancy			2
' i really thought it was trickery , ' he said			0
' i thought it was all mind games			0
' the relationship ended and he heard nothing else about the pregnancy , @entity7 said , until march 2010			1
his cellphone rang as he was walking out of class			0
a woman identified herself as a representative of an adoption agency			1
' you 've been alleged as a potential father , ' she told him			0
@entity7 asked for a paternity test			2
@entity7 grew up in a family of eight children with a single mother , and said he feels strongly about the roles a father should play ' if i 'm the father i want it , ' he said			2
" the mother has already put the baby up for adoption , ' the woman said			1
' i do n't want that , ' @entity7 insisted			2
' it 's not necessary			0
that does n't need to happen			0
' in september 2010 , @entity7 was awaiting the birth of his child , and a few nights before the due date he stayed up all night texting his ex-girlfriend			1
she was complaining about contractions			0
at daybreak he drove two hours to @entity72 , @entity73 , to be with her , but when he got there she was n't answering her phone			0
the hospital had no information			0
he drove to her house and her grandmother slammed the door in his face			0
stunned , he sat in his car across the street			0
' sir , ' a neighbor knocked on his window , ' is there anything i can do for you ? ' it took him three years , but @entity7 was finally reunited with his son at @entity9 , when he received full - time custody @entity7 explained the situation			1
' oh , honey , ' she said			0
' that baby was adopted three weeks ago			2
' under the advice of a police officer , @entity7 found an attorney			2
@entity7 drove five hours to @entity102 , @entity73 , once or twice a week for more than six months to challenge the adoption in court			2
his son now lived in @entity105 , but under orders from the judge , the adoptive parents brought the baby to @entity102 when he was 6 months old			1
@entity7 caught his first glimpse of him in the courthouse lobby , but the other parents quickly threw a towel over the baby 's head			1
' i saw how they looked at me - like i was the devil , ' @entity7 said			2
' how can anybody hate me that much ? i 'm the father			0
' ' people complain about men who do n't take responsibility for their children			0
' well , here i am , wanting to be a father to my son			0
an earlier photo of @entity7 and his son , @entity11 , who he says was put up for adoption without his permission ' and that makes me a bad guy ? ' the judge nullified the adoption in july 2011 and temporarily put the baby in state custody while giving @entity7 visitation rights			1
@entity20 , pronounced @entity137 , warmed up immediately to @entity7 's attorney			2
but light - skinned with streaks of blonde in his hair , @entity20 would n't come to his father , who 's dark - skinned with shoulder - length dreadlocks			0
' they say babies are color blind or do n't notice any of that , ' @entity7 said			2
' but i tell you , they do			0
' it did n't take long to bond , however			0
' he has a lot of energy and reminds me a lot of myself , ' @entity7 said			2
he shared custody 50 - 50 with the birth mother until the day after @entity9 last year , when a @entity73 judge granted @entity7 full custody with visitation from the mother			1
@entity7 dropped out of college to pay for the three - year court battle			1
the custody battle of @entity7 is similiar to the epic case of ' @entity167 ' , in which a biological father in @entity2 was pitted against adoptive parents out of state in 2011 he now works as a mental - health technician and plans to start nursing school this summer			1
his case resembles last year 's monumental ' @entity167 ' custody battle , pitting a biological father in @entity2 against adoptive parents out of state			1
@entity167 went to @entity178 for the first two years of her life before her father , @entity180 , won custody in 2011 and brought her back to @entity182 , an hour north of @entity13			0
then @entity167 's adoptive parents appealed all the way to the @entity186 @entity185 and , after a four - month standoff in various courtrooms across @entity2 , took @entity167 home to @entity190 last september			1
@entity7 is now suing the adoption agency for allegedly violating his parental rights by going ahead with the placement even after he objected .			1

@entity7 was playing *football* for @entity16 in @entity17 in 2009 when he began dating a girl , who then fell pregnant
they were not together when the baby was born in september 2010
when he went to be with her on the day the child was due , he found out his son had been put up for adoption weeks earlier
he challenged the adoptive parents , who lived in @entity105 , and eventually won
at @entity9 last year he was granted full - time custody of his son , @entity11 , with visitation rights from the mother
@entity7 is also suing the adoption agency for violating his parental rights
