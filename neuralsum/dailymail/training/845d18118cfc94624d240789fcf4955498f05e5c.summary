ricard : ' meditation is not just blissing out under a mango tree but it completely changes your brain ' a @entity6 genetic scientist may seem like an unusual person to hold the title - but @entity0 is the world 's happiest man , according to researchers			1
the 66 - year - old turned his back on @entity14 intellectual life 40 years ago and moved to @entity15 to study @entity16			1
he is now a close confidante of the @entity17 and respected western scholar of religion			0
now it seems daily meditation has had other benefits - enhancing mr @entity0 's capacity for joy			1
neuroscientist @entity25 wired up the monk 's skull with 256 sensors at the @entity29 as part of research on hundreds of advanced practitioners of meditation			1
the scans showed that when meditating on compassion , @entity0 's brain produces a level of gamma waves - those linked to consciousness , attention , learning and memory - ' never reported before in the neuroscience literature ' , @entity25 said			1
the scans also showed excessive activity in his brain 's left prefrontal cortex compared to its right counterpart , giving him an abnormally large capacity for happiness and a reduced propensity towards negativity , researchers believe			1
research into the phenomenon , known as " neuroplasticity " , is in its infancy and @entity0 has been at the forefront of ground - breaking experiments along with other leading scientists across the world			1
' we have been looking for 12 years at the effect of short and long - term mind - training through meditation on attention , on compassion , on emotional balance , ' he said			2
' we 've found remarkable results with long - term practitioners who did 50,000 rounds of meditation , but also with three weeks of 20 minutes a day , which of course is more applicable to our modern times			2
' he believes meditation can alter the brain and improve people 's happiness in the same way that lifting weights puts on muscle			1
the son of philosopher @entity105 and abstract watercolour painter @entity106 , became something of a celebrity after writing ' the @entity110 and @entity111 ' with his father			0
this was a dialogue on the meaning of life			0

the art of meditation is published by @entity126 books @entity127 has spoken about @entity123 in a video hosted by the charity @entity129			2
here are some hints and tips ... mr @entity0 has undergone a battery of tests , including an @entity134 ( left ) to reveal how his ' enlightened ' mind works a computer monitor displays data being recorded during an @entity138 test conducted with mr @entity0 @entity0 is a close confidante of the @entity17 @entity0 said : ' that was the end of my quiet time because it was a bestseller			1
suddenly i was projected into the western world			0
then i did more dialogues with scientists and the whole thing started to spin off out of control			0
' i got really involved in science research and the science of meditation			0
' a prominent monk in @entity153 's @entity152 , @entity0 divides his year between isolated meditation , scientific research and accompanying the @entity17 as his adviser on trips to @entity6 - speaking countries and science conferences			1
he addressed the @entity160 in @entity161 at the height of the financial crisis in 2009 to tell gathered heads of state and business leaders it was time to give up greed in favour of " enlightened altruism "			0
he was awarded the @entity170 for his work in preserving @entity173 culture but it is his work on the science of happiness which perhaps defines him @entity178 sees living a good life , and showing compassion , not as a religious edict revealed from on high , but as a practical route to happiness			0

it is a science of the mind			0
