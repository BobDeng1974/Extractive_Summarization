' some time into that game a young man ... ran onto the pitch			2
you were n't paid to do that			0
' the judge said he proceeded to run ' some 70 yards ' across the pitch , chased by stewards - one of whom fell over - before arriving at the spot where @entity8 were lining up a free kick			1
the judge said : ' you took it for them			0
to be frank you were probably a little tired by the time you got to the ball			0

asked what was going through his mind , @entity11 said : ' nothing really - it was just a moment of madness			2
it was a spur of the moment thing			0
' the judge said he had seen footage of the incident on @entity172 and asked : ' were you intending to take the free kick ? ' @entity11 replied : ' no. all i was going to do was run and as i was running i just saw the ball there so i thought i would just kick it			1
' @entity11 , who works as a receptionist at a hotel , said he has a ten - month old little boy			2
referring to the prospect of a banning order , he said : ' i was a bit concerned that when my little boy grows up i want to take him to watch the football			0
' the judge asked if his mother had ' expressed disapproval '			0
@entity11 , who represented himself , said : ' at first she was concerned because she did n't know the consequences but when she saw the @entity172 video she saw the funny side but she has had a go at me , as a mother would			0
