by @entity0 published : 19:21 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 19:22 est , 1 november 2013 the extent to which government and insurance companies have fleeced motorists for years was laid bare yesterday			2
research by the @entity6 found that the cost of vehicle tax and insurance has more than doubled over the past 25 years – even when inflation is taken into account			1
the combined cost is now a whopping 117 per cent higher in real terms than it was in 1987			2
war : the figures were condemned by @entity17 mp @entity16 , who blamed ' trendy , anti-car green policies ' motorists face annual bills of up to £ 490 for vehicle excise duty , when it was just £ 100 a quarter of a century ago			1
and insurance costs – an average of £ 280 in 1987 – are now £ 652 for fully comprehensive and £ 1,057 for third - party , fire and theft			2
the study also found that petrol and oil costs have soared by 64 per cent over the same period			1
much of the cost is taken up by fuel duty imposed by government – a levy that is among the highest in @entity35			2
to add to the burden still further , car maintenance costs have gone up by 57 per cent			2
the research reveals that the only expense to have reduced in recent years is the cost of buying a car in the first place			2
vehicles are now , on average , less than half the price they were in 1987 in real terms			0
fleeced : the cost of taxing and insuring vehicles has more than doubled in the past 25 years @entity17 mp @entity16 , a transport campaigner , said the figures confirmed that motorists are being hard hit because of ‘ trendy , anti-car green policies ’ imposed by politicians			1
he called on the chancellor to reduce both vehicle excise duty and fuel duty to help hard - pressed drivers			1
‘ motorists are amongst the most hammered taxpayers in @entity58 , ’ he said			0
‘ wherever they look , they are hit by one charge or another – whether it is the high cost of fuel , insurance charges , vehicle excise duty or speed cameras			1
this is hurting families and businesses			0
we need radical reform to look at how @entity58 can afford to get motoring again			0
‘ we ’ve had a culture of environmentalism for the chattering classes who forget about families who need their car to pick their children up from school , and businesses who rely on their car for their living			0
cars are a symbol of freedom and should n’t be taxed out of existence			0
i think the government should be looking at road tolls as long as it guarantees that vehicle excise duty and fuel duty will be reduced			1
’ vehicle excise duty was a flat rate of £ 100 a year in 1987			1
now it is charged at a rate depending on a car ’s emissions – zero for the least - polluting cars and £ 490 for the most polluting			1
the first - year rate for cars in the top band is £ 1,065			0
the @entity102 said average car insurance rates were around £ 280 in 1987 – but are now often four - figure sums			0
the rise is put down to the fact that there are now more younger drivers – insurance companies will charge more for third - party insurance because they perceive applicants as a higher risk – and because of a sharp increase in personal injury claims , particularly whiplash cases			0
@entity117 spokesman @entity116 described the rises in fuel prices as ‘ shocking ’			0
‘ the price rise is not just down to inflation and changes in the oil industry , it ’s also very much down to the incredible rise in fuel duty charged by the government , ’ he said			1
a spokesman for the @entity129 said : ‘ drivers have felt for many years that they are an easy target for whichever government , local authority or business has wanted to maximise its take			0
