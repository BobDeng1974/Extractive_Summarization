by @entity0 published : 16:28 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 02:41 est , 22 october 2013 @entity1 and @entity2 held ‘ tense ’ face - to - face talks yesterday as the @entity4 prompted further @entity6 anger with a bizarre claim that they knew nothing about a key plank of @entity11 education policy			1
the prime minister and his @entity4 deputy had a private lunch meeting at which mr @entity1 expressed serious concern about a @entity4 attack on free schools over the weekend			1
the deputy prime minister is understood to have stood his ground , insisting his u-turn was about wanting ‘ better standards for parents ’			0
@entity1 and @entity2 are said to have held ' tense ' talks yesterday over the @entity4 's u-turn over free schools mr @entity2 is expected to use a speech later this week to confirm he will no longer support some of the fundamental principles of free schools , which have been set up by businesses , charities , religious organisations and groups of parents free from council control			1
the deputy prime minister says he no longer supports some of the most important freedoms exercised by free school heads , including their power to set their own curriculum and hire teachers without union - recognised qualifications			1
business secretary @entity43 fuelled the row last night by claiming the @entity4 had not voted in favour of allowing free schools – like private schools – to hire whoever they like			1
‘ i think we want to make sure , as @entity4 , that the free schools are properly supported by trained teachers and that 's where we 've parted company to some extent with the @entity57 [ @entity58 ] , ’ mr @entity43 told @entity49			1
‘ the original idea which we voted for at the beginning of this @entity63 , the assumption was that there would be properly qualified teachers and that seems to have changed			0
’ the remarks drew a scathing response from senior @entity6 , who pointed out that @entity4 peers had voted with the government in the @entity72 to kill off a @entity74 attempt to prevent free schools having an open hiring policy			1
' it 's typical of @entity43 and @entity2 that they now claim they never knew about something that they actually voted for - no wonder people hate mps for lying all the time , ’ said one @entity11 source			1
' @entity2 's rich parents sent him to a brilliant private school that does n't rely only on government certified teachers but he now says he wants to deny that flexibility for state schools			1
‘ it 's typical of @entity2 's hypocrisy and dishonesty			0
he 's happy for rich people to keep going to schools where the heads make hiring and firing decisions but he wo n't let everybody else do the same			2
’ even some of mr @entity2 ’s allies expressed private unease about the party ’s confusing position			2
a @entity4 source said mr @entity2 and mr @entity1 had had an ‘ open and polite ’ discussion in which the deputy prime minister ‘ made clear he supported free schools but wanted better standards for parents ’			1
another source said the deputy prime minister had ‘ ranted ’ at mr @entity1 about remarks from a @entity11 source attacking him for ‘ cheap sanctimony ’ in yesterday ’s @entity117			0
@entity43 fuelled the row by claiming his party had not voted to allow the schools to hire who they like asked about his comments on free schools on @entity49 's @entity125 programme last night , mr @entity2 said : ' i personally - maybe i did n't explain it well enough - do n't find it complicated to say look , we 're moving towards a world in our school system where there are more academies more free schools , where schools for the first time in a generation have much more freedom and autonomy to set their rules what they do every day and so on ... ' we need to decide in years ahead what that means for things like standards			1
so what i 'm saying is as a @entity4 , i actually am in support of our push to give schools more freedom but in future i also want to make sure we give parents the reassurance that standards are met			2
i do n't find that very complicated			0
row : the coalition split centres on the free schools set up by @entity6 education secretary @entity58 ' you have to move with the times - we 're moving towards a different way of running our schools			1
give them more freedom but give parents the reassurance that they 're going to be taught by qualified teachers			0
' a @entity6 source said : ' we 're surprised the contents of a private meeting have been briefed to the press			1
the @entity173 seem a bit rattled by the confusion over their free schools policy			0
' @entity74 ’s shadow education minister @entity177 said : ‘ @entity2 is locked into this failure too			2
he ordered his party through the lobbies in favour of unqualified teachers and his schools minister , @entity183 , said he was 100 per cent behind the policy in @entity63 last week			2
this is just more proof that you ca n't trust a word the @entity4 say			0
’ @entity187 , chairman of the education select committee , accused the deputy prime minister of making a ‘ strangely illiberal policy announcement ’ and compared him to the late left - wing @entity74 cabinet minister @entity191			2
‘ my understanding is the a typical liberal view would be believing that you trust the front line to decide who should teach but you hold them strongly to account through exam results and through @entity200 , ’ mr @entity187 said			0
‘ i thought they believed in localism and yet here we are , at the first sign of trouble and @entity2 comes over all @entity191			0
it ’s a very peculiar approach and it ’s already leading to splits in the @entity4			0
’ mr @entity187 said that mr @entity2 ’s comments left @entity183 , the @entity4 education minister who backed free schools , including ‘ superb ’ teachers without formal qualifications , in the @entity212 last week in a ‘ difficult position ’			1
@entity214 , a @entity216 peer , said the deputy prime minister was being ‘ two - faced ’ and hypocritical since he was almost certainly taught by ‘ brilliant ’ unqualified teachers as a child at the expensive private @entity220			0
education minister @entity221 said there would be no change to @entity11 policy , despite mr @entity2 ’s objections			0
‘ i think it is important that they have freedom over teaching and over the curriculum			0
i think that is what is making them successful , ’ she said			0
‘ i am slightly surprised to hear what @entity2 has to say , because on thursday @entity183 made an impassioned speech in favour of free schools having these freedoms			1
‘ so there seems to be a bit of confusion about their policy but we are very clear that the government policy is that free schools should have that freedom			0
‘ the proposals went through on free schools with @entity4 support			2

@entity2 said on *sunday* he no longer supported some of the freedoms held by free school heads
these include the power to hire teachers without union - recognised qualifications and set their own curriculum
@entity43 fuelled row by claiming @entity4 had not voted to allow the schools to hire who they wish
@entity6 source said today party peers voted with the government to kill off a @entity74 attempt to prevent open hiring
