in the months before @entity4 was tragically gunned down outside @entity5 in @entity6 on december 8 , 1980 , by deranged killer @entity7 , life for the ex @entity1 and his bride @entity3 was full of ' unclouded happiness '			1
and those moments , during the creation of what would be their last album together , are captured in the collection of photographs of the couple , published for the first time in the book , @entity18			1
the photographs were taken by @entity20 , who has now written about them in a book by him and @entity3 , published by @entity23 in multiple international editions			1
the touching and beautiful collection of never - before - seen photographs were shot while they were making their last album together : the @entity18			0
' @entity4 could n't go out anywhere while he was in the @entity45 because of his fame , ' writes @entity3			1
' coming to @entity6 gave him freedom			1
i think this was the moment when he took off his armor			2
' ironically , @entity4 was killed in front of the @entity6 apartments building behind the couple , where they lived @entity4 and @entity3 leave their apartment at @entity5 and head to @entity58 across the street the @entity1 had broken up a decade before			1
@entity4 had embraced a new life he described as ' househusband ' and he was now focused on creative , political and musical projects			2
the couple had made international news in 1969 with their @entity66 protest , the @entity68 in @entity69 and @entity70			0
the @entity18 album was going to be @entity4 's comeback at age forty , reflecting his personal growth in music and self that he attributed to @entity3 , now 82 , the first woman who told him that his previous lifestyle of wantonly pursuing women , alcohol and drugs was meaningless			1
@entity81 and @entity4 had finally resolved a bitter rift that dissolved when both men bonded over fatherhood and baking bread			2
they were once again ' good friends ' , @entity81 told @entity88 on his show last december			0
@entity81 was one of three people that @entity3 called when she returned home from the hospital that fateful night to say that @entity4 had not survived the five hollow - point bullets @entity7 fired at the singer just outside their apartment at @entity5 , across the street from @entity58			1
' it was just so horrific that you could n't take it in – i could n't take it in ' , @entity81 said			0
' just for days , you just could n't think that he was gone			0
it was just a huge shock and then i had to tell @entity104 and the kids			0
it was very difficult for everyone			0
that was like a really big shock , i think , in most people 's lives			0
a bit like @entity114 there were certain moments like that			0
' beautiful boy : @entity4 relaxing with son @entity118 at their @entity5 apartment hanging out : the couple , in the @entity6 living room , loved living in the city at work : the couple worked intensely for over a month , recording 28 songs - 14 of @entity4 's and 14 of @entity3 's the concept of @entity18 was a back - and - forth dialogue , a kind of musical conversation between them @entity132 was deeply shocked by his bandmate 's murder but had had little contact with him in the years prior to the murder			1
broken up emotionally , @entity137 and his wife , @entity138 , immediately flew to @entity6 to offer comfort to @entity3			1
' they were two people in one , ' @entity137 said			0
@entity4 was the unofficial leader of the @entity1 , ' the cheeky wit and sardonic soul of the @entity1 ' , @entity141 wrote in 2014			2
his death was the end of an era			0
@entity3 remembers the last time the couple went into the studio together in 1978 , the @entity149 in @entity6			1
@entity3 introduces the collection of photos in the book			2
' when @entity4 and i decided to make the album @entity18 , breaking a five - year silence , we wondered whom we should ask to take the photographs			2
as the two of us thought about it , suddenly the face of @entity20 came to mind			2
' i said , " for once , i 'd really like to have a @entity164 photographer			0
" @entity4 quickly agreed , saying , " right , that sounds good			2
" i never expected that " for once " would turn out to be the last album @entity4 and i made together , and that " for once " would live on forever '			2
@entity20 remembers that last recording session : ' i checked in at the @entity168 , and by early afternoon i was down the street at the door of @entity149 on @entity171 , the recording studio where @entity4 and @entity3 were working on the final parts of the record , inserting choruses and other additional layers of sounds			1
' the two had been working intensely for over a month , recording 28 songs — 14 of @entity4 's and 14 of @entity3 's			1
the concept of @entity18 was a back - and - forth dialogue , a kind of musical conversation between them			0
' as i entered the studio , the atmosphere was of creativity and concentration			0
@entity3 greeted me and immediatelyintroduced me to @entity4			1
he was slim and dressed all in black			0
his demeanor was very sweet , gentle			0
he welcomed me warmly and then returned his attention to four backup singers , directing them as they laid down the chorus to a song he had written called " woman "			0
chill : @entity4 was trying to clear away those feelings - of fame , of the past - in order to become a new person , says the photographer ' throughout the sessions , i noticed that @entity4 always spoke with the staff and the studio musicians in a quiet , clear manner , remaining calm and focused , despite the seemingly endless days and nights of work			1
overall , there was a feeling of both relief and exhaustion in the air , a sense that this important and cathartic project was finally nearing completion '			0
while dining later at mr @entity215 's , @entity20 learned that he and @entity216 were both 40 years @entity217 revealed ' he was at a turning point , that he wanted to forget everything that had come before and start again ' , @entity20 writes			1
' he was trying to clear away those feelings — of fame , of the past — in order to become a new person			0
' he explained to me that without @entity3 , he would n't be there now - that the first part of his life he had been obsessed with alcohol and women and drugs , and that @entity3 had been the first woman to tell him that what he was obsessed with was meaningless			1
' he felt that those words had changed him , and this new album was going to celebrate that change '			0
a month after @entity20 returned to @entity164 , @entity4 was shot and killed			1
' i look back at these photos , so many years later , and i feel that i captured @entity4 and @entity3 at their happiest moment			1
they were doing creative work , working on the album , recording together			0
and they were raising their son and loving each other and living a full life together , ' @entity20 offers			2
' it was such a lucky time for me to be there , a moment of unclouded happiness for @entity4 and @entity3			1

before @entity4 was murdered in 1980 , his days with @entity3 were captured on camera by noted photographer @entity20
@entity4 had been obsessed with alcohol , women and drugs , @entity4 told the photographer , until @entity3 came into into his life
the couple worked *tirelessly* on @entity261 's last album
' coming to @entity6 gave him freedom . i think this was the moment when he took off his armor , ' writes @entity3 , in what proved to be tragic irony
