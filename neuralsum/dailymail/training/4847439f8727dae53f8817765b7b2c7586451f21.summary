a brisk daily walk of just 20 minutes could add years to your life , scientists said last night			1
in a stark warning against couch - potato lifestyles , they said lack of exercise killed twice as many people as obesity			1
the @entity11 study of 334,000 people found that even a modest amount of activity prolonged life			1
and the least fit had the most to gain			0
the researchers could not say how much extra life could be gained through using exercise in this way to move from the ‘ inactive ’ to the ‘ moderately inactive ’ part of the population			1
but even the obese could expect a 16 per cent reduced risk of dying early			0
those of healthy weight could profit by 30 per cent			0
@entity37 , who led the study , said : ‘ this is a simple message : just a small amount of physical activity each day could have substantial health benefits for people who are physically inactive			1
‘ although we found just 20 minutes would make a difference , we should really be looking to do more than this – physical activity has many proven health benefits and should be an important part of our daily life			1
’ the researchers estimated that 337,000 of 9.2million recorded deaths of @entity54 men and women were attributable to obesity			1
but twice this number – around 676,000 deaths – could be blamed on inactivity			0
but a brisk 20 minute walk every day could cut the chance of dying early , it is claimed government guidelines advise @entity19 to do 150 minutes of moderate activity such as gardening , dancing or brisk walking , or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise , including playing sport , running or aerobics , every week			1
but a recent survey found that a third of people can barely manage to walk for 30 minutes over seven days , even when trips to the shops , work or school are considered			1
and a report backed by the initiative @entity78 last year found that physical inactivity cost the economy up to £ 10billion a year through sick days , healthcare costs and early deaths			0
professor @entity83 , director of the @entity85 epidemiology unit at @entity11 , said : ‘ helping people to lose weight can be a real challenge , and whilst we should continue to aim at reducing population levels of obesity , public health interventions that encourage people to make small but achievable changes in physical activity can have significant health benefits and may be easier to achieve and maintain			1
’ june @entity97 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity98 , said : ‘ the results of this study are a clear reminder that being regularly physically active can reduce the risk of dying from coronary heart disease			1
‘ the research suggests that just a modest increase in physical activity can have health benefits			2
adults should aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity a week , carrying it out in sessions of ten minutes or more			2
whether it ’s going for a walk , taking a bike ride or using the stairs instead of the lift , keeping active every day will help reduce the risk of developing coronary heart disease			2
’ a brisk 20 - minute walk would burn between 90 and 110 calories			0
the study was reported in the @entity122			0
the authors defined premature death as dying before the average age for doing so			2

risking accusations of ‘ nannying ’ , health spokesman @entity132 will say today the ‘ promotion of physical activity ’ must be at the centre of health policy			0
@entity127 will also impose maximum amounts of fat , sugar and salt that can be contained in food marketed at children			0
there will be ‘ targeted action ’ on high - strength , low - cost alcohol with minimum prices and a ban on larger bottles			0
and plain cigarette packaging will be introduced immediately to ‘ halt the industry ’s increasingly sophisticated methods of recruiting new , young smokers ’			0
@entity127 want children born in 2015 to become the first ‘ smoke - free generation ’ .			0

a lack of exercise kills twice as many people as obesity , researchers warn
the @entity11 study found even modest activity prolongs life
twenty minutes of walking a day cuts premature risk of death by a third
