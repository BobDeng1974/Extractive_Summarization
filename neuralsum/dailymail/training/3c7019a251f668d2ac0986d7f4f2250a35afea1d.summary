by @entity0 @entity1 is an old fashioned footballer			1
when @entity1 celebrates , he celebrates like a player from an old black and white @entity3			1
there is no badge kissing , no sliding , no cupping of the ear			2
he simply throws two arms in the air			0
when the goal is a special one , he sinks to his knees			0
on every occasion , there is nothing readable in his face besides joy			0
no self - adulation , no arrogance , simply the pure joy of having found the back of the net			0
invaluable : @entity1 is happy to play in any attacking position so long as he is scoring goals back of the net : @entity1 celebrates after scoring for @entity27 against @entity28 during the 2010 @entity29 as a footballer , his game is not about speed , it is not about power , and it is not even about rigourously trained technical ability			1
it is immensely difficult to characterise his strongest attributes , because he is not a modern athlete			1
he is a bundle of limbs , masquerading as a professional footballer of the 21st century			0
but @entity1 masquerades very well indeed			1
for @entity27 and for @entity43 , @entity1 ’s versatility is invaluable			1
he is happy in any position , so long as he is attacking , and believes that ' everything depends on whether you have the right ambition for the position you are in '			2
it is that which makes him so unpredictable for opponents			0
he is an efficient creator of space , an efficient passer of the ball , and an efficient goalscorer			0
roar talent : @entity1 lets his emotions show every time he finds the net for his country and @entity43 at the last @entity29 in @entity60 , he was a ruthlessly efficient goalscorer			1
only 20 years old and only one year of regular @entity62 football to his name , @entity1 scored five @entity29 goals – two of them against @entity66 – and claimed the @entity67			1
it is a prize which he intends to defend in @entity69			0
not that the trophy itself is particularly important to him			0
in a recent interview with the @entity73 , he declared that ' if you gave me half a candle for scoring the most goals at a @entity29 , i would treasure that as much as the @entity67 '			1
that is @entity1 in a nutshell			1
not for him , the personal museum or the statue in his image			0
he wishes to win everything , but it is the winning that counts , not the medals			0
in @entity27 , he is seen as a classic @entity87 farmer boy			1
married at the age of 19 , and entirely at home in a pair of @entity91			0
so @entity87 is he indeed , that a columnist for the @entity94 paper @entity92 described him as a ' cultural export '			0
on the back of @entity99 ’s interest in @entity1 , the same columnist wrote : ' you can have him , @entity66 , but only if we get prince @entity102 and @entity103 '			1
' you can keep the nutters from @entity106 ' , he added			0
achievement : @entity1 was awarded the @entity67 after scoring five goals at the 2010 @entity29 finals how loyal to @entity110 he really is , is yet to be seen			1
in recent months , he has voiced his love and commitment to @entity43 , but also his displeasure at his less central role under @entity115			1
for as much as @entity1 is grounded and almost old fashioned , it is ambition which drives him on more than anything			1
you may not find him modelling underwear ( though he does do adverts for milk in @entity27 ) , but he is always after the next bit of success			2
' when i was a kid , i tried a lot of sports ' , he says , ' but when i was n’t very good at something , i let it go			0
i need something where i can set myself goals '			2
@entity1 , the @entity87 farm boy , knows his own limits			2
he will always love his home , he will always love @entity43			2
but as a footballer , he always needs the next challenge			0
for now , it is to defend his @entity67 in @entity69 .			2

@entity1 claimed the @entity67 at the 2010 @entity29
@entity27 *forward* loves to score goals and play attacking football
@entity43 star does *n't* *resemble* a modern athlete
@entity1 won the @entity67 at the last @entity29 in @entity60
