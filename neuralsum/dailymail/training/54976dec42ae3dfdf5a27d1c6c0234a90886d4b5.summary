‘ y’all ’ is the @entity1 way of saying ‘ you all ’ or ‘ you guys ’ and is a much - loved word			1
it ’s charming , useful and down to earth and therefore very @entity1 , but controversy has been welling up over a number of decades over its use in the singular			1
one language expert has described this debate as ‘ the @entity14 of dialect studies ’ , because examples of it being used in this way are so few and far between			1
‘ y’all ’ is the @entity1 @entity1 way of saying ‘ you all ’ or ‘ you guys ’ and is a much - loved word @entity23 , author of in @entity24 , writing in @entity25 , argues that most @entity26 will firmly deny that they ever use y’all to mean the singular ‘ you ’			1
she said : ‘ the whole idea of singular " y'all " strikes them as , at best , the fanciful invention of confused and clueless @entity31 , and , at worst , an outrageous insult			2
’ to underline this point she quotes linguist @entity36 , who in his 1962 study of @entity39 @entity38 , wrote : ‘ if anything is likely to lead to another @entity42 , it is the @entity43 's accusation that @entity26 use you all to refer to only one person			2
’ some wrongly think that when @entity26 ask a shop keeper , for example , whether ‘ y’all got some eggs ? ’ they are using the word in the singular , when actually they mean ‘ do you or any of your colleagues have any eggs ? ’ , @entity23 writes			1
sensitive : one writer declared that ‘ if anything is likely to lead to another @entity42 , it is the @entity43 's accusation that @entity26 use you all to refer to only one person '			2
@entity60 is a steam boat on the @entity62 , in the heart of @entity64 however , she said that there are instances of y’all been used as a form of singular address by @entity26 , for example a waitress asking a lone customer ‘ how are y'all 's grits ? ’			1
the explanation may be rooted in social pressures , though – as it may be deployed in the above circumstance as a mark of deference , @entity23 said , to establish an atmosphere of gentle decorum where simply saying ‘ your ’ might seem a little abrupt			0
it is also used by @entity26 to reinforce their identity , she claims			0
so sometimes they use it in the singular when they ’re travelling in other parts of the country or feel themselves outnumbered by @entity31 in their own community			0
a study by @entity91 and @entity92 found that many @entity26 exaggerate their use of the phrase , and use it in ways that might not be strictly correct , to turn it into a ‘ badge of identity ’			0
@entity23 said : ‘ @entity31 … have been hearing singular " y'all " all along			0
they just did n't realize it was not part of @entity38 , but a different dialect , exaggerated @entity38			0

‘ y’all ’ is the @entity1 way of saying ‘ you all ’ or ‘ you guys ’
