a controversial anti-vaccination organisation has come under fire for comparing compulsory vaccination to rape in a social media post			1
the @entity5 , an anti-vaccinations lobby group , posted an image to their @entity8 page on thursday which shows a man holding a woman with his hand over her mouth in an aggressive silencing gesture			1
the tag line on the image read , ' forced penetration			2
really - no big deal , if it 's just a vaccination needle and he 's a doctor			0
do you really " need " control over over your own choices ? '			0
the @entity5 has come under fire for comparing vaccinations to rape the image was posted in response to tough new laws announced by social services minister @entity28 earlier in april , which means that parents will no longer be able to access childcare benefits simply by signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on ' personal , philosophical or religious ' reasons			1
however , a president of the @entity5 said the message had nothing to do with the group			1
' i can state categorically that @entity41 does not support or agree with the sentiments or messages portrayed in the picture , ' she said			1
' we do not own the page it was posted on			2
' ' what the @entity5 does support and believe in , is the right of all parents to make an informed choice in regards to vaccinating their children , whether they vaccinate , selectively vaccinate or do not vaccinate at all , ' she said			1
' we are pro-choice , pro-information and pro-parental rights			0
the new federal law , which was in part prompted by the death of one - month - old @entity60 from complications arising from whooping cough , means that parents who refuse to immunise their children are set to lose up to $ 15,000 a year for every child when the changes come into force from january 1 , 2016			1
the post , which has since been removed , caused an instant outcry from followers and opponents of the group alike , with social media users labelling the post ' tasteless ' , ' disgusting ' , and a possible trigger for those who had suffered sexual assault			1
' dear rape victims , according to the rabid anti-vaxxers what you went thru is no worse than			2
shame , ' said one social media user			0
' are you saying that your child being immunised is as bad as your child being raped ? this could also be very triggering for victims of sexual assault , ' said another			0
the administrator of the page defended the post , maintaining that is was n't tasteless , but honest			1
' what truly is tasteless is our elected government trying to tell us that we have to vaccinate our children even if we do n’t believe it is best for their health , ' the administrator wrote			0
and if you find this post confronting – imagine how you would feel if you were a parent who was being told that they were going to have to vaccinate their children or starve			1
' @entity107 , the ceo of @entity108 said the comparison was ' so irresponsible and inappropriate '			0
social media users labelling the post ' tasteless ' , ' disgusting ' , and a possible trigger for those who had suffered sexual assault the image was posted in response to tough new ' no jab , no pay ' laws which was announced by social services minister @entity28 earlier in april ' to compare a doctor injecting a child against something like the measles to rape … it 's obscene , ' ms @entity107 told @entity127			1
on wednesday , a post to the page said that the controversial post was made by someone independent to the organisation			2
' as written in the about section , the @entity5 has not owned this @entity8 page for some time			1
this page is open to the public			0
we sincerely apologise for an earlier post that caused offense to many , including supporters			0
we are still investigating and have taken your comments on board , ' the post said			0
the @entity5 has previously used the metaphor of rape to oppose vaccinations , when reports of a child being given a court order to be immunised was labelled by the group as ' court ordered rape '			1
' think this is an exaggeration ? think again			0
this is assault without consent and with full penetration too , ' the post said			0
' if you were the doctor ordered to administer this vaccine and the mother was standing there , holding her child under a court order while you prepared the shot and she was begging you to stop and crying that it would hurt and you continued to do it anyway - how different is that from rape ? ' the administrator later commented on the post			2
@entity172 has previously come under fire when it was stripped of its registered charity status last year			0
the @entity5 has previously used the metaphor of rape to oppose vaccinations ' think this is an exaggeration ? think again			1
this is assault without consent and with full penetration too , ' the post said @entity183 fair trading minister @entity182 demanded that the group surrender i '' ts authority to fundraise , which it has done , under the @entity188 , ' he said			2
' an investigation has highlighted a number of potential concerns , ' he told the @entity192			0
mr @entity182 said that the @entity193 had been collecting information as to the accuracy of facts provided by the group about the dangers of immunisation			2
' we will continue to monitor the information that they put on their website			0
we will continue to ensure that they present themselves as an anti-vaccination advocacy			0
that 's entirely up to them to do that			0
we want to make sure that they do n't ever promote misleading information			0
' the @entity212 released a statement in relation to the @entity5 last year , which contained a warning for members of the public when considering the information the lobby group posted on their website			1
' @entity5 does not provide reliable information in relation to certain vaccines and vaccination more generally , ' the statement said			1
' @entity224 considers that @entity5 ’s dissemination of misleading , misrepresented and incorrect information about vaccination engenders fear and alarm and is likely to detrimentally affect the clinical management or care of its readers			2
' the tough new vaccination law was in part prompted by the death of one - month - old @entity60 from complications arising from whooping cough on wednesday , a post to the page said that the controversial post was made by someone independent to the organisation in december 2012 , the @entity183 @entity244 ordered the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) - which ms @entity245 was then president of - to change its name or risk being shut down			1
the move followed ' numerous ' complaints from both the public and the @entity251 that the @entity5 name was misleading the public and was n’t an accurate representation of its activities			2
the @entity5 claims to be pro-choice and a ' vaccine safety watchdog ' however , t - shirts on the group 's website seemed to promote more fierce objectives which rule out vaccinating children at all			1
one top featured the slogan : ' @entity264 ' .			0
