@entity0 emerged as the state with the second - highest percentage of regular marijuana users as it began legalizing the drug , according to a new national study			1
the @entity6 reports the study by the @entity8 on @entity9 and @entity10 found about one out of every eight @entity0 residents older than 12 had used marijuana in the past month			1
only @entity13 topped @entity0 in the percentage of residents who reported using pot as often , according to the study			1
the study averaged state - specific data over two - year periods			0
it found that , for the 2011 - 2012 period , 10.4 percent of @entity0 residents 12 and older said they had used pot in the month before being surveyed			1
that number jumped to 12.7 percent in the 2012 - 2013 data			0
that means about 530,000 people in @entity0 use marijuana at least once a month , according to the results			1
that 's an increase of about 4 percent			0
in @entity34 , which also legalized marijuana use and limited possession for adults , monthly pot use rose about 20 percent to 12.3 percent of people 12 and older			1
the survey is among the first to quantify pot use in @entity0 since late 2012 , when voters approved legal pot use and possession for those over 21			0
but the survey did not analyze data from 2014 , when recreational marijuana shops opened , which means it is not a good indication of the effect of commercial sales on marijuana use			2
" i do n't think this tells us about the long - term impacts of legalization , " said @entity55 , @entity56 , professor @entity54 , who studies marijuana policy			2
the number of medical marijuana patients in @entity0 rose over the same time period , so the results are not surprising , @entity54 said			0
he told @entity65 that researchers will have a better idea about pot use in the first state to legalize recreational sales of the drug once they can focus on data showing how many people use pot daily			2
" the fraction of people who are monthly users who are in fact daily users has gone way , way up , " he said			0
nationally , about 7.4 percent of people 12 and older reported monthly marijuana use			2
that 's an increase of about 4 percent			0

only @entity13 topped the percentage of residents who used the drug
it means around 530,000 people smoke marijuana every month
the national average is just over four per cent
