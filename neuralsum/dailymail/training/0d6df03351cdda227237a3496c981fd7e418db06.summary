@entity1 would have rejected and confronted the ‘ pessimism ’ of @entity3 , @entity0 said last night			1
the chancellor sought to seize the mantle of the late prime minister for today ’s conservatives , saying they should project an optimistic vision of @entity11 ’s future and address the country ’s self - doubt			1
he likened @entity1 ’s mission to drag the country out of the malaise of the 1970s to that now facing the government , and said the success in turning the economy round over the past five years showed @entity11 ’s best days still lie ahead			1
@entity0 has said @entity1 would have rejected and confronted the ' pessimism ' of @entity3 addressing the first @entity22 on @entity23 , organised by the @entity24 think tank , mr @entity0 said @entity25 was represented by ‘ pessimists ’ who ‘ do n’t trust human instincts ’ and want to ‘ control and suppress them with a more powerful state ’			1
but in a clear reference to the rise of @entity3 , which topped the polls in last month ’s @entity37 elections , he added : ‘ there ’s also a pessimistic tendency that can emerge on the populist right			1
the tendency to bemoan the present day , and put the past on a pedestal			0
‘ it sees life as better in 1954 or even 1854 , than 2014			0
it is a tendency that says @entity11 ’s best days are behind it – when i believe our country ’s brightest days lie ahead			1
@entity1 confronted and overcame the same pessimism in @entity11 in the 1970s			1
she was always talking the country up , not down			2
we must do the same			0
’ former @entity50 minister @entity49 , @entity1 ’s unofficial biographer , has said she would not have voted @entity3 but might have been ‘ secretly cheering them on ’			2
questioning : mr @entity0 suggested she would have dismissed the pessimistic prospectus of @entity55 's party but mr @entity0 suggested she would have dismissed @entity3 ’s pessimistic prospectus			1
‘ she believed @entity11 could be a strong economy again ; that militant trade unions could be overcome ; that the @entity64 could be won , ’ he told delegates at @entity60 ’s @entity59			2
‘ it is difficult to appreciate today how completely outside the consensus her confidence in @entity11 and its capabilities was			2
‘ not just on the @entity71 , but the @entity72 too , a deep malaise had crept in			0
managed decline had been the mantra until she arrived			0
‘ as optimistic conservatives who believe in the power of ideas like freedom and aspiration , our generation ’s mission is to confront and overcome this latest bout of western self - doubt			0
our free market economy can be the most prosperous			0
’ education secretary @entity88 undermined mr @entity0 ’s message by telling the same conference that ‘ living in the 18th century ... for many of us would be a very attractive thing to do ’ .			0
