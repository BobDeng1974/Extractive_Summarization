we ’ve cleaned up free kicks with the magic spray , there seems to be less diving , but football has a new evil – wrestling in the penalty area			1
defenders are checking , blocking , holding , grappling , using force to foul their opponents and too often referees are allowing it to take place			1
when the talented young referee @entity15 pulled up serial offender @entity16 two weeks ago , all hell seemed to break loose			1
his fellow officials should have supported him by following up the bold decision , but instead we had @entity19 allowing double headlocks at @entity21			1
@entity16 of @entity22 was rightly penalised for wrestling @entity24 striker @entity23 to the ground during last weekend 's match at the @entity27 referee @entity15 had no hesitation in pointing to the penalty spot after @entity16 fouled @entity23 but when @entity31 's @entity30 ( left ) and @entity32 were held in headlocks by @entity35 defenders @entity36 ( left ) and @entity37 in sunday 's match , referee @entity19 failed to act @entity30 appeals for a penalty as he lies on the ground with @entity36 on top of him referee @entity19 , who later sent @entity30 off , ignored @entity31 's appeal for a penalty hands off in the box is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box			1
whether it is wrestling , grappling , shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the @entity35 vs @entity31 match - the area has become a free - for - all for cheating			1
and that means fewer goals in the @entity58			2
for too long , referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring			1
it 's time to end that			1
so join us in our campaign to say @entity66 to players and referees			1
we ’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it			2
i have no sympathy for a defender who concedes a penalty for wrestling or throwing his opponent			1
the headlocks against @entity32 and @entity30 were remarkable and should have resulted in a penalty			1
mistakes from @entity19 saved @entity35			1
of course , it is n’t easy for a referee when there are five or six match - ups for every corner , so they need to be educated , too			1
defenders know a referee can not see what every camera can and so he will take a risk in the hope of gaining an advantage			1
some are more obvious to spot than others – and headlocks are a bit of a clue ! i played once against @entity101 in the @entity102			2
i had been watching the @entity104 defender and the way he would face a player – and not the ball			0
he would then wrestle his opponent in much the same way as we are seeing in the @entity58 today			0
i worked out a way to combat this			0
i gave myself five yards and ran at him aggressively before the corner came in			0
he was startled , the referee came over and said : ‘ what is going on ? ’ i explained he needed to watch @entity101 , we both got a warning and when the corner came in , all eyes were on us and @entity101 could n’t apply his blocking tactic			1
it was a small victory			0
defenders who do not attack the ball , but face their opponents and focus on stopping … that ’s not football			1
it ’s blatant fouling and deserves punishment			0
if you are obsessed more with stopping your opponent than winning the ball , that can not be right			0
@entity16 is a regular offender			0
i ’m convinced @entity135 must have shown him how to do it , when he was manager of @entity22			0
@entity31 ’s powerhouse @entity30 is a contact player , using his huge strength and physicality to draw fouls or to invite a reaction			1
there are different degrees of contact in the box			0
as a defender , you might feel you want to act as a barrier			0
@entity101 ( right ) , seen here with @entity154 in a match against @entity156 , would frequently try and wrestle opponents to the ground @entity159 developed a strategy for dealing with players like @entity101 when he encountered them with @entity156 blocking is part of the game			1
basketball is a non-contact sport , but there is an art to blocking and stopping your opponent from getting where he wants to go			2
it ’s the same with football			2
the odd tug of a shirt was in my make - up , but only when an opponent was close			0
if he was too far away , it became too obvious to the referee and you risked giving away a penalty			1
there is no defender in the world who has n’t tugged a shirt to impact on the balance of his opponent			0
i would use whatever it took and take more risks further up the pitch , but i did n’t like to concede an advantage to the striker and by fouling in the penalty area , you are at high risk to concede a spot kick			1
my attitude was ‘ i ’m here to stop you , but i do n’t want to give you anything ’			0
a defender has to stay calm and focused in that moment			0
that ’s where zonal marking and concentrating on your space works better than going man - to - man in the area			2
@entity211 allows you to concentrate on winning the ball in your zone , whereas man marking can invite the temptation to foul			0
@entity138 of @entity139 has also been guilty of wrestling opponents in the box i was into judo as a kid and never lost a bout , but i never used a judo throw in a game			2
watching some of the recent incidents , such a skill might come in handy ! i was never taught to foul			2
you learn what you need to do			0
@entity229 , at @entity156 , worked on a lot of repetitive defensive work			0
the back four would work together and he would overload on strikers , coming at your from all angles			0
it was like being in the land of the giants			0
we were hard to play against , we defended for our lives and we were aggressive and strong			0
but we did n’t resort to wrestling and it should n’t be allowed now			2
referees must clamp down , but strikers will need to be fair , too			1
if they are diving , trying to con the referee into believing they have been wrestled , then that should result in serious punishment			2
there will be some strikers who will see this campaign and think ‘ happy days , i ’ll fall over , win a cheap penalty			2
’ there needs to be more honesty from them , too .			0

wrestling in the penalty area is football 's new evil
players are getting away with blocking , holding and grappling too often
the latest example came at @entity21 on sunday
@entity30 and @entity32 were put in headlocks by @entity36 and @entity37 but referee @entity19 did nothing
it is just the latest incident of late as defenders push their luck
referees need to clamp down on these incidents immediately
