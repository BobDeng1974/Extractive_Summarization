a relegation scrap at @entity1 might have seemed like an attractive proposition for @entity3 with @entity4 trailing inside five minutes and the locals again restless in fear of a fifth straight loss			1
in fact , it still might , regardless of the turnaround which followed			0
but come full - time , @entity3 – bookies ’ favourite for the vacant manager ’s position at @entity15 - was applauding those same supporters who had threatened to turn in the wake of @entity19 ’s early opener and embracing the players who have repeatedly bailed him out this season			1
it should have been a cause for celebration			0
instead , @entity3 refused to speak to the press after the game , fueling speculation he is tempted by a return to @entity29			0
no reason was given by club officials but it is thought he did not want to answer questions on the link to his former club			0
@entity4 midfielder @entity35 scored his first goal for the club in their 3 - 2 victory at home to @entity41 on sunday @entity35 ( left ) toe - poked a left - footed shot underneath the body of @entity41 goalkeeper @entity44 in the second half @entity35 ( left ) watches on as his strike trickles towards the @entity41 goal to give @entity4 a 3 - 1 lead against the @entity41 @entity35 ( centre ) is congratulated by @entity50 ( left ) and @entity51 on his goal @entity4 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : alnwick 6.5 ; janmaat 6.5 , @entity53 ( c ) 7 , @entity54 7 , @entity51 6 ; @entity55 7 , @entity50 7 , @entity56 6.5 , @entity35 7.5 , @entity57 6 ( @entity58 90 ) ; @entity59 8 ( @entity60 73 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 manager : @entity3 8 bookings : @entity57 , @entity51 goals : @entity59 34 , @entity55 51 , @entity35 68 @entity41 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity70 ; @entity71 6.5 , @entity72 5.5 , @entity73 5.5 , @entity74 6 , @entity75 6 ; @entity76 5.5 , @entity77 6 ( @entity78 45 , 5 ) , @entity79 6 ( @entity80 61 , 6.5 ) ; @entity81 6 , @entity19 7 ( @entity82 71 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 manager : @entity89 6 bookings : @entity77 , @entity73 goals : @entity19 5 , @entity80 84 referee : @entity93 5 attendance : 52,313 man of the match : @entity59 click here for all the stats , goals - including @entity35 's goal ( above ) - and heat maps from @entity102 assistant @entity103 would offer nothing more than saying @entity3 was ‘ happy and delighted ’ by the result which halted their losing sequence			1
the victory , though , was not without its good fortune			0
@entity59 should have been sent off after landing his elbow into the jaw of @entity71 four minutes before he pounced to cancel out @entity19 ’s strike			1
and @entity113 boss @entity89 fumed : ‘ he should n’t have been on the pitch ( when he equalised )			0
‘ the referee should have seen that			0
it is an action you do n't want to see on a football pitch			0
it is a clear elbow to try and hurt someone			0
‘ i do n’t think that was the reason why we lost but it would have been a completely different game			0
’ @entity59 could well face retrospective @entity129 action but they can not take away the points which lift the @entity132 up to ninth			1
@entity19 ( left ) gave @entity41 an early first half lead on five minutes with a close - range volley @entity19 ( right ) watches on as his shot smashes into the roof of the net to give the @entity41 a 1 - 0 lead against @entity4 the @entity141 international celebrates his strike at @entity102 during @entity41 's @entity144 clash @entity19 ( centre right ) is congratulated by his @entity41 team - mates after his volley breaks the deadlock man - of - the - match @entity55 fired them in front after the break and @entity35 netted his first in black and white midway through the second half			1
substitute @entity80 did spark hope of a comeback six minutes from time but the hosts held on for their first win since upsetting league leaders @entity160 three weeks ago			1
and @entity103 said : ‘ @entity3 ’s happy			0
it ’s a fantastic win for us			0
we ’ve been on a run of games where we have n’t won but this was one of our best performances of recent times			0
‘ when you look at where we were after the first half dozen games of the season ( bottom ) we ’re delighted to be here ( ninth )			2
’ for @entity41 , they have now lost six of their last eight to leave @entity89 under pressure			2
and the @entity179 said : ‘ when you are in a period when nothing goes in your favour you need to be strong			0
‘ we do need to build some momentum in the league			0
we have n’t had that this season			0
' @entity41 midfielder @entity78 tries to run with the ball past the chasing @entity56 during sunday 's @entity144 encounter @entity4 forward @entity59 ( circled ) was lucky to stay on the pitch after elbowing @entity71 in the face that moment proved to be the turning point as moments later @entity4 equalised on 34 minutes through @entity59 's strike @entity197 's ( centre ) finish came following a cross from @entity4 defender @entity54 ( front ) @entity59 ( left ) runs away in celebration at scoring the hosts equaliser during sunday 's @entity144 encounter @entity132 boss @entity3 punches the air in delight after his side draw level against @entity41 @entity59 ( left ) and @entity71 exchange words during the match after the @entity206 international 's elbowing incident it had all started so perfectly			1
@entity79 slid a pass in behind @entity57 and @entity71 swept first time onto the boot of @entity19 – making his first league start for the club after 14 months out with a knee injury - who applied an equally prompt finish from six yards			1
one criticism of @entity4 this season has been their execution from corner - kicks			1
in the aftermath of one failed delivery – @entity55 scuffing to the near post – one home fan hollered , ‘ what do you do on the training pitch , @entity3 ? ’			1
on 37 minutes that supporter had his answer			0
@entity35 worked the ball short to @entity56 and they again swapped passes before the latter hoisted a cross to the far post			2
there @entity54 peeled away from his minder to hook back to @entity59 and he stabbed home for his ninth of the season			2
@entity59 , of course , was lucky to be on the field			2
@entity4 had finished the first half much the stronger and that was how they duly began the second			2
@entity50 escaped down the right and centred and , with @entity76 under pressure from @entity59 , the @entity41 man inadvertently shinned towards his own bottom corner where @entity44 somehow got down to flip around the upright			1
it mattered not , within 60 seconds the @entity179 was picking the ball out of the @entity256 net , undone by compatriot @entity55			2
@entity4 full back @entity51 ( left ) stretches to head a ball from a @entity132 corner , as @entity44 ( right ) punches clear @entity55 put @entity4 2 - 1 ahead soon after the interval with a low , right - footed strike inside the penalty area @entity55 ( second right ) is hugged by his @entity4 team - mates after giving them the lead early on in the second half @entity55 ( second left ) points to heavens after putting his side ahead at @entity102 during sunday 's match the 21 - year - old won an admirer in sir @entity272 for his performance at @entity274 on @entity275 and a few more might well be taking note after this cunning finish			1
@entity278 gifted possession to @entity56 who zipped a pass slightly behind @entity55 just outside the area			2
that was no problem for the in - form frontman , scooping the ball into his path before dropping a shoulder inside two blue shirts and locating the bottom corner to leave @entity290			1
@entity78 was on for @entity41 in a bid to inject some creativity but he ended up gifting the game - clinching third to @entity35			1
@entity294 crossed from the right and @entity78 , having backtracked to intercept , was left wishing he had n’t bothered when he miskicked and @entity35 stole in to poke through the legs of @entity44			2
@entity80 set up a nervy finish when he chipped over @entity298 having been sprung clear by @entity75 ’ throughball but @entity300 held on for an invaluable victory			1
not that @entity3 wanted to talk about it			0
@entity41 forward @entity80 ( left ) pulled one back for @entity41 with minutes remaining with a clipped effort the @entity306 international ( right ) watches on as his shot delicately beats @entity298 in the @entity4 goal @entity80 was quick to get the ball from the back of the net as the @entity41 pushed for a late equaliser @entity41 players trudge off the pitch dejected as they fall to their eighth league defeat of the season			1

@entity19 gave @entity41 an early first half lead , volleying home from close range on five minutes
@entity4 were lucky not to be reduced to 10 men when @entity59 elbowed @entity71
@entity59 then later equalised for the hosts with a low , right - footed shot on 34 minutes
@entity4 forward @entity55 put them 2 - 1 shortly after half - time with a neat strike into the bottom corner
@entity35 extended the @entity132 lead with his first strike for the club on 68 minutes
@entity80 gave the @entity41 hope with minutes remaining after scoring a clipped finish over @entity298
