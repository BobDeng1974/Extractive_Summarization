@entity3 's independent control and disciplinary panel fined the @entity4 @entity11 just £ 65,000 - a remarkable £ 15,000 less than @entity13 striker @entity12 was forced to pay for showing branded boxers as part of a goal celebration - for their part in the ugly post-match scenes			1
in a statement issued today , the @entity2 said they were looking to @entity3 to send a strong message to the football community that racism would not be tolerated in the game , but were left disappointed by the sanctions			2
abuse : @entity27 claimed to have been subjected to monkey chants anger : @entity30 reacts to the racist taunts the statement said : ' the @entity2 has expressed its dismay at the totally inadequate fine levied by @entity3 against the @entity4 fa after the disgraceful scenes of racism and violence during the recent under 21 match with @entity8			1
' everybody has been looking to the confederation to send out a strong message as a deterrent to ensure that behaviour such as this is eradicated from our game			0
unfortunately once more a disappointing penalty has been imposed			0
' chief executive @entity47 was outraged by the perceived leniency of the panel 's decision , and expressed his disappointment that @entity8 players @entity53 and @entity54 were banned for their part			1
@entity54 was banned for two games , and @entity53 is set to miss one match through suspension			1
he said : ' this is a totally inadequate fine which sends a very poor message out to the football world			2
i intend to write to @entity63 expressing our dissatisfaction and calling for stronger action			2
in addition , we will strongly support the @entity11 in their appeal against the decision to charge @entity54 and @entity53			1
@entity63 is considering an appeal to increase the one - match spectator ban and 80,000 euro fine imposed on @entity4			1
too lenient ? @entity63 could lodge an appeal @entity3 itself can appeal to increase the severity of the punishment			1
@entity3 sources said @entity63 has taken note of the sanction and will make a final decision once he has read the full file on his return from @entity83 next week			1
the @entity86 body ’s prosecuting inspector had proposed more ' drastic ' measures , the @entity4 federation has admitted			2
the @entity2 are not alone in their incredulity after the relatively lax punishment			0
@entity92 manager @entity91 today said : ' i saw it yesterday and felt for all the @entity8 players and staff who were there			2
it is bitterly disappointing to say the least			0
' the sanction is not too dissimilar to someone showing a sponsor on a pair of pants			0
i thought it was poor really			0
but it is up to them			0
' @entity108 manager @entity107 added : ' to see the @entity110 players punished as well is a little difficult to take			0
everybody was looking to see what @entity3 might do and i think what they have done is try to just get this one over with as quick as they can and not dealt with it severely enough			2
saying his piece : @entity92 manager @entity118 expressed his disappointment at @entity3 's decision ' we should ask @entity3 , what are your policies on racism ? let ’s get those policies and see if they are good enough to deal with racism			1
if i was @entity12 i ’d ask for my fine back			2
' @entity133 defender @entity132 , the target of racial abuse by @entity136 last year , also contrasted the sanction against @entity4 with the 100,000 euro and one - match ban handed to former @entity139 striker @entity12 for displaying a betting firm ’s logo on his underpants during @entity143			1
@entity132 tweeted : ' wow uefa ai n’t serious with their punishment ... so showin a sponsor is worst than racism and fighting ! ' his brother @entity149 added : ' @entity3 are not serious at all on racism			2
fines do not work at all			0
they have zero impact on federations / clubs / fans / players # fact			0
' @entity3 need to talk to this generation ...			2
. they do n’t seem to be up to date on this issue ? ? @entity162 punishments needed as a deterrent # simple			0
' the @entity11 also criticised the sanction and will appeal against two - match and one - match bans for @entity54 and @entity53 respectively			1
ugly : the end of @entity169 's win over @entity4 was marred by clashes flashpoint : @entity8 striker @entity172 in the tunnel @entity11 general secretary @entity174 said : “ we are disappointed with the sanctions levied by @entity3 with regards to the racist behaviour displayed towards @entity8 ’s players			1
' let ’s be clear , racism is unacceptable in any form , and should play no part in football			2
the scenes were deplorable and we do not believe the sanction sends a strong enough message			0
' the @entity11 reported the racist abuse to @entity3 plus a number of other incidents			1
full - back @entity27 , who was dismissed after the final whistle for kicking the ball away in anger , complained he had been subjected to monkey chants throughout the match and as he left the pitch			1
@entity4 @entity11 secretary general @entity198 appeared to suggest that the @entity3 official prosecuting the charges had also demanded tougher action			1
@entity198 said in a statement : ' if we take into account what the drastic proposed penalty by the disciplinary inspector @entity205 we have not been hit so hard			0
that 's pants : @entity13 's striker @entity12 was fined £ 80,000 for showing bookmakers ' logo ' i believe that this is a final warning to all of us who work in @entity4 football , including coaches and players and fans , because for even the smallest mistake @entity3 can now impose the most rigorous punishment			1
' lord @entity223 , chairman of @entity224 , slammed the sanction as “ a paltry slap on the wrist ” , adding : ' again we have n’t seen decisive action from @entity3			0
' @entity230 , executive director of @entity86 anti-discrimination body fare , said @entity3 had failed to display the necessary leadership			0
@entity230 said : ' the original offences warranted a more severe collective punishment than a ban on spectators for one match			0
' this is a moment in which leadership to challenge discrimination is needed from all authorities			0
this sanction falls short of that objective			0
' @entity4 and the @entity11 have three days in which to lodge an appeal - while @entity3 themselves can also appeal against the control and disciplinary body if they too think the independent commission has been too lenient			1
shocking : @entity30 was distressed after the ugly scenes marred the match the punishments as they stand			0
