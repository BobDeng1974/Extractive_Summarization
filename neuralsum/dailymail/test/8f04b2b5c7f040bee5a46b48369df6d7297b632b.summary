the ambulance service is facing unprecedented demand from the rising and aging population and in some areas 999 calls are up by 15 per cent on last year			1
paramedics are also having to respond to rising numbers of non-urgent calls from patients frustrated that they can not get an appointment with their gp			2
they are also having to waste much of their time queued up outside @entity22 units which can not accept their patients because staff there are also very busy			0
