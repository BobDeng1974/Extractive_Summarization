an @entity1 barber has created a yarmulke made from human hair to allow @entity5 men to cover their heads without fear of being targeted by anti-semites			1
@entity9 said he was inspired to create the ' magic ' skullcap , known as a kippa in @entity13 , by rising anti-semitism - with a particular interest from buyers in @entity17 and @entity18			1
' this skullcap is washable , you can brush it , you can dye it , ' @entity9 said in his salon in central @entity1			0
' it was created so people could feel comfortable going to places where they are afraid to go , or places where they ca n't wear it , and feel secure			0
' @entity1 hairdresser @entity9 places a yarmulke made of hair samples onto a man 's head in the city of @entity34 , central @entity1 @entity17 has seen a spike in anti-semitic attacks in recent years			1
the killing of four @entity17 jews in a hostage standoff at a @entity40 kosher market earlier this month has deepened fears among @entity42			0
officials in @entity1 are expecting — and encouraging — a new influx of @entity5 immigrants following the @entity40 standoff			1
since the attacks , @entity1 prime minister @entity47 has encouraged @entity49 @entity5 to move to the jewish state			1
many @entity5 in @entity49 , especially @entity17 , say they feel unsafe walking around wearing the symbols of their faith			1
a 2013 @entity55 report found that one in five @entity49 @entity5 avoid wearing kippas or other @entity5 symbols for fear of being harassed or attacked			1
the skullcap could also serve @entity5 traveling to the @entity60 , where they encounter hostility in many @entity63 countries			1

' you do n't feel a thing			0
it feels like it is part of your hair			0
there is n't such a difference between this and a regular kippa			0
it feels the same , ' said @entity86 , who modelled a dark brown skullcap at @entity9 's salon			0
devout @entity5 men traditionally wear skullcaps as a sign of respect and reverence for @entity94			2
rabbi @entity95 , who teaches at a prominent @entity97 yeshiva , said that @entity5 skullcaps must be visible and not hidden , but added that under certain unforeseeable circumstances , such as a risk of attacks , the ' @entity65 ' may be valid			2
' our sages said that , for example , when we are in danger , then it 's possible ( to hide it ) , ' he said , adding that the wearer should consult his own rabbi for guidance			0
the hairy kippa received mixed reactions among skullcap - wearing men in @entity97			1
some said they felt ill at ease with the idea of hiding their identity abroad , but others welcomed the protection			0
