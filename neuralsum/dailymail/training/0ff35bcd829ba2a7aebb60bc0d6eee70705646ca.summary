an exclusive hotel has banned alcohol and pork after being taken over by a @entity4 businessman who wants to run it ‘ in accordance with @entity8 law ’			1
the strict @entity10 policy was imposed without warning this week at @entity12 ’s @entity11 – where the bar and grill was previously run by @entity16 judge @entity15			1
@entity17 said the new rules were swiftly implemented on tuesday on the orders of the new @entity21 owner , forcing waiters to tell disgruntled guests that much of the menu was no longer available			0
drinkers were offered only non-alcoholic beer and elderflower cordial			1
forced to improvise , chefs are now trying to source chicken and beef sausages instead of pork varieties for breakfast and have replaced the popular hog roast with rabbit terrine			0
the £ 220 - a - night hotel is believed to be one of the first in the country to introduce the strict @entity21 policy but staff say the changes have caused business to plummet , with many reservations cancelled			1
several fear for their jobs unless the hotel – previously voted the @entity61 ’s trendiest place to stay and where @entity62 once filmed a show – is marketed for a different clientele			2
an it consultant , who has been a regular at the hotel , said : ‘ a group of us were meant to be meeting in the bar and they said : “ we ca n’t serve alcohol any more			2
” ' when i contacted the manager to ask why , he told me that the new owner wanted it to be a @entity8 law hotel			1
under @entity8 law , you ca n’t make a profit from alcohol			1
’ the guest said he would no longer book the hotel in future , adding : ‘ they ’ve got to be careful			0
it ’s been quiet and this is almost the death knell			0
’ the strict @entity10 policy was imposed without warning this week at @entity12 ’s @entity11 – where the bar and grill was previously run by @entity16 judge @entity15 ( pictured ) on community website london - se1 , a poster called @entity90 said customers were ‘ kicking off ’ , adding : ‘ who on earth believes a “ dry ” hotel and restaurant is going to work in central @entity12 , never mind @entity99 square ? this is not @entity93 ! ’ @entity101 posted : ‘ i ’m a teetotaller but think the no alcohol and no pork policy is too prescriptive			1
what next ? are guests in the linked hotel going to be asked to provide marriage certificates if they want a double room ? are same - sex couples going to be refused entry ? ’ the change was so swift that the hotel ’s website and menus have not yet been updated and the venue still bills itself as the place to stay for ‘ party people , foodies and fashionistas ’			1
menus for the @entity122 still offer full @entity124 breakfast with sweetcure streaky bacon and @entity126 , and roast pork belly with black pudding			0
the restaurant boasts of ‘ signature @entity61 dishes ’ but even the children ’s option of sausage and chips will now have to be changed to meet the new policy			2
the hotel website also continues to boast of champagne receptions , its ‘ inviting cocktail bar ’ and is illustrated with pictures of guests drinking beer			2
customers calling to make reservations are warned they will not be allowed to order beer , wine or spirits because the hotel is under ‘ new management ’			2
however , they can buy alcohol from outside and drink it in their rooms			0
several staff at the hotel did not know the new owner ’s identity and had been told only that he was from the @entity4			1
some were puzzled by the new policy at such short notice as the hotel does not have a significant @entity21 clientele and the food is not halal			0
nearby restaurants said they saw a surge in business when customers walked out of the hotel ’s grill on tuesday			1
the @entity169 said it had 12 extra diners who specifically asked : ‘ do you serve alcohol because the hotel we are staying in does n’t ? ’ masterchef judge @entity15 , who ran the hotel bar and grill until last year , said last night : ‘ it does n’t bother me what the owner wants to do			1
‘ it ’s his religious point of view not to serve alcohol and pork and i respect that			0
i stay at the hotel and if i want to drink i go elsewhere			0
’ the hotel was also the setting for @entity188 ’s @entity187 in 2012 when @entity62 , @entity189 and @entity190 competed to run the venue for charity			2
it was voted the trendiest in the @entity61 by @entity194 in 2010 and rock stars are among those who have sampled its 80 designer bedrooms , which include loft rooms overlooking @entity12 ’s skyline			0
@entity201 of @entity202 , which has operated the hotel since it opened in 2009 , said decisions were made to change ‘ some elements of the business ’ ‘ these are in the best interests of the future of the hotel , ’ he said			0
‘ we always have , and continue to , welcome guests of all shapes , sizes and denomination			0
’ @entity202 also operates the @entity217 hotel in @entity218 , @entity12 , which does not serve alcohol and has a vegan restaurant .			1
