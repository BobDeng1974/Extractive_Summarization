by @entity0 a father who was fined for taking his daughter out of school for a family holiday , has quit his job to avoid it happening again			1
@entity7 fined @entity8 £ 120 for taking seven - year - old @entity9 on holiday to @entity11 in june , during the only time he was allowed to take off work			1
he claims he had explained the situation to teachers at @entity15 in @entity7 and was told not to worry but was later hit with the fine			2
now the 41 - year - old salesman will leave his role at the @entity26 car dealership so that he can take his family away during the school holidays			0
' it 's not the only reason , but it is one of the reasons , i want a family life and my job is not centred around school holidays ' he told the @entity36			0
mr @entity8 is also considering a career change in order to have a better work / life balance			0
he said the new role , working with his brother in the property market pays less but will also mean he pay less tax			0
he continued to say that if he gets fined for taking his daughter on holiday again , he will ' cause a fuss ' by counting the money out in one pound coins and presenting it to the council			1
despite mr @entity8 discussing their break with teachers , the family found the fine when they returned home from the holiday			2
the letter stated that they would be fined £ 60 for taking @entity9 out of school without permission and this would go up to £ 120 if not paid by a certain date			1
video courtesy of the @entity63 previously head teachers could grant permission for families to take children out of school in ' special circumstances ' , but in september last year this changed to ' exceptional circumstances ' ( posed by models ) mr @entity8 eventually decided to pay the fine to avoid ending up in court as he was worried he would end up with a criminal record which could affect his job prospects			1
a @entity7 spokeswoman said : ' parents should always seek permission from the head teacher to take their children out of school in the term time			1
' this applied before september 2013 as well as after , although the new government regulations which came in meant head teachers could no longer grant holidays during term time in " special circumstances " , only " exceptional circumstances " which are classed as unavoidable causes such as illness or exclusions			2
' as a result we have seen more referrals from schools which resulted in fines			0
' we adopted a zero tolerance policy so that there was consistency across the authority and ensured that all our head teachers , schools and governing bodies supported this approach			0

@entity8 was fined £ 120 for taking daughter @entity9 out of school
@entity7 say children can only be taken on holiday in ' exceptional circumstances '
