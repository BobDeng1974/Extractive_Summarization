by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:45 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 11:55 est , 1 october 2013 @entity4 teenagers are too lazy to do the ‘ menial ’ jobs snapped up by immigrant workers which keep the economy moving , @entity2 claimed today			1
in a highly - provocative intervention , the @entity10 mayor backed tv chef @entity12 who complained about ‘ wet behind the ears ’ youngsters who ‘ whinge ’ about working long hours			1
mr @entity2 said that far from being ‘ apoplectic ’ at the claims , he was left ‘ vaguely depressed ’ by the fact that too many young @entity18 lacked the drive to seize every opportunity which comes their way			1
’ he told delegates : ‘ this is where the speech gets tricky - the question we have got to ask ourselves is : are young @entity28 always able and willing to take up opportunities in the opportunity city that we are trying to create ? ’ he said @entity12 ' had a point ' when he complained that @entity47 immigrants were ' much stronger , much tougher ' than @entity18 and warned his restaurants would close without them			1
mr @entity2 said more needed to be done to persuade youngsters to view the low - paid , low - skilled jobs which @entity10 creates in such abundance as ' stepping stones , as a beginning to a life in work that can take them anywhere '			1
@entity2 at the 2006 @entity25 conference , mr @entity2 fell out with @entity12 over the chef ’s campaign to make school meals healthier			1
addresing @entity61 in the conference hall today , mr @entity2 said : ‘ @entity63 , i have made it a rule of these conferences never to disagree with @entity12 , because last time i did so i was put in a pen and pelted with pork pies by the media			1
‘ but the other day he said something that made me gulp because he was complaining about the work ethic of young people these days			1
’ agreement : the @entity10 mayor backed tv chef @entity12 who complained about ' wet behind the ears ' youngsters who ‘ whinge ’ about working long hours recognition : mr @entity2 said he could see ' looks of sad acknowledgement ' on the faces of the audience as he read out mr @entity12 's remarks gulp : mr @entity2 said he knew he was going to get into trouble with his speech , but added : ' that 's my job ' in an interview with @entity91 in the summer , @entity12 said : ‘ the average working hours in a week was 80 to 100			1
that was really normal in my 20s			0
but the @entity96 regulation now is 48 hours , which is half a week 's work for me			1
and they still whinge about it			2
‘ @entity4 kids particularly , i have never seen anything so wet behind the ears ! ‘ i have mummies phoning up for 23 - year - olds saying to me , ' my son is too tired '			0
on a 48 - hour - week ! are you having a laugh ? ' tv chef @entity12 @entity12 added : ‘ i think our @entity47 immigrant friends are much stronger , much tougher			1
if we did n't have any , all of my restaurants would close tomorrow			2
there would n't be any brits to replace them			0
’ turning to the conference audience , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i am seeing looks of apoplectic … no actually i ca n’t			0
i can see looks of sad acknowledgement			0
i can see a vague depressed look of recognition			2
‘ i know and you know that there are millions of @entity4 kids who are as dynamic and young people are as dynamic and go - getting and motivated as any potential millionaire masterchef , of course there are			2
‘ but my question is what if @entity12 has a point , what if he has half a point , or even a quarter of a point			1
’ controversy : mr @entity2 said @entity12 may have phrased his attack in a ' provocative way ' but admitted he was on to something future : welfare , crime and education reforms are needed to better prepare young people for the jobs market applause : while mr @entity2 's speech was more downbeat in previous years , he received a standing ovation from delegates asking the audience if they agreed with @entity12 , they shouted back : ‘ yes ! ’ mr @entity2 added : ‘ he is on to something			1
he may have phrased it in a provocative way but he was saying something that i think resonates , right ? ‘ but if he has a point then we need to think about what are the possible origins for that difference in motivation that he claims to detect			0
‘ we need to think about what we politicians are doing about it			0
if it is to do with welfare as some people say it is then do n’t we need @entity164 to get on with reforming that system			0
‘ and if it ’s to do with education as some people think it is then do n’t we need @entity170 to get on with his heroic work restoring rigour and realism to the classroom			2
‘ and getting away from the all must have prizes approach where all pupils must be above average in maths			0
’ laughs : @entity61 was in the audience for mr @entity2 's joke - filled speech challenge : mr @entity2 said more needed to be done for young people to ' harness their talents more effectively ' fans : mr @entity2 has been the centre of attention since arriving in @entity188 for the @entity25 conference he said young people also need ‘ boundaries ’ and ‘ solidity to their lives ’ to stop them falling into unemployment and crime			1
‘ we have got to tackle that complex of problems , crime , welfareism , educational underachievement			0
‘ and you ’ve got to make sure that kids growing up in @entity10 are able to take the opportunities that our city offers and at the same time we must make sure that they do n’t dismiss some jobs as “ menial ” which is a word i sometimes hear			0
‘ and they see them - those jobs which @entity10 creates in such abundance in the same way as @entity12 ’s eastern @entity47 see them – as stepping stones , as a beginning to a life in work that can take them anywhere			1
‘ i think there is a vast and latent genius in these young people and if could harness their talents more effectively then they would not only have more fulfilling lives but we could drive even faster the great flywheel of the @entity10 economy that is now the most diverse in @entity47			1
’ @entity10 mayor @entity2 admitted he was ' fudging ' his response to questions about his political ambitions @entity2 has admitted that he is ' fudging ' over whether he could make a return to the @entity233 at the general election			2
there has been growing speculation that the mayor of @entity10 could become an mp again before the end of his term in 2016			2
@entity61 fuelled the rumours by disclosing that he had discussed the idea with mr @entity243			0
the prime minister told @entity245 's today programme that the mayor could ' absolutely ' make a comeback before the country goes to the polls in 17 months ' time , and said he would give him a ' warm welcome '			1
mr @entity2 was mobbed by media and @entity25 activists as he toured the exhibition hall at the party 's conference in @entity188			2
during a round of broadcast interviews , he was asked by @entity260 whether he was determined to keep fudging his answers on whether he wanted to return as an mp in 2015			0
' yes , ' he replied to laughter			0
mr @entity2 , who served as member for @entity264 until 2008 , dodged a barrage of questions about the possibility of serving as mayor and an mp at the same time			2
stressing his commitment to his current role - to which he was re-elected last year - mr @entity2 said : ' i have got a huge job to do ... i am going to give it my all			0
' i do n't want to leave office until some of the things we have got going are absolutely in the bag			0
' the programme is to be mayor of @entity10 for the next 750 days , or whatever it is			0
' asked which parliamentary seats he could look at if he did seek a return , mr @entity2 said : ' the seat i want , i can describe it to you , it has a spongey bottom bit and it swivels and it is to be discovered in the office at @entity292			0
' the mayor said mr @entity61 's words about him were ' very kind ' , but insisted the @entity25 leader was capable of winning the general election without his help			1
' i am a toenail in the body politic , ' he joked .			0
