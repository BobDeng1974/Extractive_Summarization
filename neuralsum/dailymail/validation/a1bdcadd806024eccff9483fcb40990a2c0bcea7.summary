it had started as a joyful day			2
@entity1 , 30 , @entity2 schoolteacher , was on vacation with her family in the @entity6 mountains			1
the trip had been idyllic , and they were preparing for one last swim before driving home to @entity2			2
her three small children , then aged between two and seven , ran ahead and got into the family suv , which had its engine running and was parked next to a cliff leading down to a deep canyon			1
in seconds , the car slipped into gear and started to roll			2
she survived the accident and battled for years to regain her ability to walk , before eventually being forced to accept that she would never walk again happiness : @entity1 and her three children , l - r : @entity31 , 7 , @entity32 , 2 , @entity33 , 5 , in 1999 , before the tragic accident that left @entity1 unable to walk			1
she threw herself underneath the wheels of a runaway suv to stop it rolling over a cliff with her children inside struggle : after the accident , @entity1 travelled to @entity42 to undergo intensive rehabilitation			1
she had a stem cell transplant and surgery in an effort to walk again			1
tragically , she eventually had to accept that she would be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life ' i just saw complete fear , ' she told the @entity52			1
' i remember their little eyes were huge , looking at me just like , " help me , do something "			2
' without thinking , she rushed over and threw herself between the vehicle and the canyon , refusing to let her children die			1
she continued to struggle with the car even as she found herself being dragged under the wheels			1
' i just was throwing myself in front of it just to put something in its path , ' she said			1
' i remember thinking , " i did n't make it in time and i 'm getting run over			2
i 'm going to hear a crash pretty soon			2
' ' i tried to stop it with my hands , which , of course , i could n't , ' she told @entity72			2
' and i remember feeling it begin to run over me			2
i fell backwards , and the front of the car caught me by the heels			2
' i did like a somersault under the car and the third time it hit i knew that it broke my back			0
i was 30 - years - old and the whole life i knew was gone			1
' but she had already done enough			0
her sacrifice had slowed the car 's momentum just enough to allow her father to rush over and activate the brake			0
deadly : the family suv			1
it had been left parked with its engine running on the edge of a cliff over a canyon , while the family got ready to drive home to @entity2 from @entity6			1
disaster struck when the three children jumped into the car and it slipped into gear , rolling towards the cliff however , @entity1 was so severely injured that everybody thought she was going to die			1
her children stood around her crying as the emergency services were called			1
' the back tire basically went this way , and just crushed everything , my lungs , my ribs , my clavicle , ' she recalled , speaking to @entity72			1
' i had my head tilted , and they said that 's what saved my life as the tire went this way			1
my father put his hand on the brake before it went over the canyon and said , " @entity1 , @entity1 , i got it ! " and then i remember hearing my mother scream , and then they ran to the back of the car and found me			1
' i could n't see because the blood vessels had broken in my eyes from the pressure of being run over , and so i told my dad			0
i said , i do n't want to live , i said i 'm blind and i 'm paralyzed , i just want to die			0
' and he said , no , no , no , do n't say that , you do n't want to die , do n't say that			0
and so the next thing i remember is in a helicopter being flown			0
my family , they were a huge support			0
they 're the reason i basically survived			0
they gave me the desire to keep living and to go on			0
' it was like this voice said , " you 've got a choice here , ' she told @entity23			0
' you can go in if you want to tell your kids goodbye and say those parting words , but if you want to fight , you 've got to fight			0
' and when i heard them screaming , i knew i had to fight			0
' this took place in 1999 - she first spoke to @entity23 in 2004 - and since then much has changed			1
her children , @entity31 , 22 , @entity33 , 20 , and @entity32 , 17 , are thriving ; @entity31 has just graduated from @entity159 , and @entity32 says that his mother is his ' inspiration '			1
but joy herself , now 46 , will never walk again			1
' after the show i went to @entity42 because i 'd really been searching for a cure , ' she told @entity165 this week , 11 years after the accident , on @entity23 : where are they now ? ( sundays , 9 p.m. et on @entity169 )			1
' that was pretty much my focus			0
i had a stem cell transplant and i went through surgery ... but it did n't make me walk again			1
' after years of arduous rehabilitation , there came a moment of realisation			2
' i remember lying in my bed one day and being depressed and hearing my children playing outside , ' she said			2
' i remember thinking then , it 's my choice			0
i can lie here and i can be depressed and i can miss out a lot in life			0
' or i could learn to walk again			2
maybe not walk in the physical sense , but walk in life			2
' happy ending : the family are trying to put the pain of the accident , and the subsequent divorce , behind them and focus on the positive things in life			0
@entity196 , second from right , says ' i could learn to walk again			2
maybe not walk in the physical sense , but walk in life ' proud : @entity1 with her daughters @entity31 , 22 ( left ) , and @entity33 , 20 ( right )			1
both girls are incredibly proud of their mother , and @entity33 says that she ' does more than most moms do ' that was exactly what she did			0
her younger daughter , @entity33 , 20 , said this week that her mother was more active than most other parents			0
' honestly she has n't let her wheelchair stop her from anything , ' she said			0
' i actually think she does more than most moms do			0
' the accident continues to cast a long shadow over their lives , however			0
when she was going through rehabilitation , @entity1 recalled , a doctor told her that 99.2 per cent of marriages ' do not make it ' after the woman suffers a serious injury			1
after 23 years of marriage , @entity1 and her husband also become two more victims of this statistic			1
recalling their recent divorce was the only moment that @entity1 broke down in tears during the interview			1
' i 'm hurt , ' she said			0
' i think that in the beginning , we should have had major counselling			0
that would have helped a lot			0
' unfortunately , we did n't			0
i think we were so caught up in my rehab and trying to get me better than we did n't pay enough attention to what he was going through			2
' but if there is one thing she has learnt from her experience , it is guts			0
' it 's life , ' she said			0
' i know it 's something i 'll make it through			0
' then again , her heroic act of 11 years ago shows that she was full of guts already			1
together : @entity1 , centre , with her daughter @entity33 , 20 , left , and her son @entity32 , 17 , right			1
they have all pulled together since the accident , although @entity1 's marriage tragically broke down under the stress of her rehabilitation family : @entity1 's three children , @entity31 , 22 , left , @entity32 , 17 , centre , and @entity33 , 20 , right , pictured in 2012			1
they are full of admiration for their mother , who saved their lives in 1999 by throwing herself under a moving suv			1
@entity32 , 17 , says she is his ' inspiration '			0

in 1999 , @entity1 , now 46 , saved her children by throwing herself *beneath* the wheels of a suv that was rolling towards a cliff with them inside
she suffered *horrific* injuries and after years of rehab she was forced to accept she would never walk again
speaking 11 years on , she says she has come to terms with her disability - but *reveals* that her marriage of 23 years did not survive the strain
