@entity1 director @entity0 warned saturday that imposing a travel ban to the countries known to be dealing with an @entity5 outbreak could make the problem worse , as it would cut off the affected areas from receiving necessary medical aid			1
such was the case recently in @entity10 - where the @entity5 death toll is nearing 3,500 people - when @entity14 aid workers were trying to get into the country , @entity0 said			1
' their ability to get there was delayed by about a week because their flight was canceled and they were stuck in a neighboring country , ' @entity0 told a press conference saturday , according to @entity24			2
' in terms of the entry process , we really need to be clear that we do n't inadvertently increase the risk to people in this country by making it harder for us to respond to the needs in those countries , by making it harder to get assistance in and therefore those outbreaks would become worse , go on longer , and paradoxically , something that we did to try and protect ourselves might actually increase our risk			0
' though we might wish we can seal ourselves off from the world , there are @entity41 who have the right of return and many other people that have the right to enter this country , ' he said			0
as the number of potential @entity5 patients continues to rage in the @entity41 , @entity0 stressed there remains only one confirmed case - @entity61 in @entity63			1
' we have definitely seen an increase in the number since this patient was diagnosed - that is as it should be , ' @entity0 said			0
' we have already gotten well over 100 inquiries for possible patients - this one patient has tested positive			2
' we expect we will see more rumors , concerns , possibilities of cases			0
until there is a positive test that 's what they are , rumors and concerns			0
' federal officials confirmed saturday that the suspected @entity5 patient at the @entity85 's @entity84 did not have the disease , @entity81 reported			1
similar scares in @entity88 and @entity85 also tested negative for @entity5			1

he was mistakenly turned away from a hospital before returning two days later via ambulance			0
@entity61 is now reportedly in a critical condition @entity61 was mistakenly sent home by a @entity63 hospital last week , even after telling doctors he had recently visted @entity10			1
he returned via ambulance two days later and is now said to be in a crtical condition , according to @entity81			0
