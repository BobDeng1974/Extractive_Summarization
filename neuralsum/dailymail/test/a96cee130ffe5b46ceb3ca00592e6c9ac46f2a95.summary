pensioners and neighbours have criticised the £ 750,000 refurbishment of sheltered accommodation which they say has made it look like @entity5			1
all of the 36 units at the @entity8 sheltered accommodation have been given the colourful treatment which has been labelled an ' eyesore ' by local residents			1
but the local council defended the colour scheme , claiming it will help residents with poor eyesight find their way home			1
@entity18 , 76 , from @entity19 said the changes to the property looks ' more like a children 's playscheme ' the 36 homes as they were before the council spent £ 750,000 including funds from the @entity28 on the renovation one pensioner , @entity18 , 76 , said residents think the property looks ' more like a children 's playscheme than sheltered accommodation '			1
mr @entity18 , who has lived in one of the flats for three years , told the @entity37 : ' it is a total waste of public money			2
the colours are totally unsuitable for the older people that live here			2
' they should put up a sign saying " welcome to @entity5 "			2
' the residents ' rent , of £ 103 a week plus bills , has remained the same since before the refurbishments took place			1
one neighbour , who lives opposite @entity51 and who did not wish to be named , described the building as an ' eyesore '			1
she said : ' it would be great if it was for kids			2
if it was a nursery it would look lovely			0
it looked much better the way it was before they put the colour on it			1
' however @entity63 , who lives on @entity64 , said she was ' not indifferent to it '			0
she said : ' i can see how residents might not like it			1
it 's a shame it is not somewhere where more people can see it and appreciate it			0
but i would n't complain about it			0
' @entity75 , head of housing for @entity78 council said the aim of the refurbishment was to ' change the look and feel of the property and bring it into the 21st century '			1
mr @entity18 said after the colourful renovations that : ' they should put up a sign saying " welcome to @entity5 "			0
' she said : ' it is quite loud and vibrant			0
the design wo n't suit everyone 's tastes and not everybody is going to like it			0
' this was about making a statement saying this is somewhere a little bit different			0
' she said the vibrant colours , both internal and external , were chosen to help residents with low levels of dementia and those with sight problems			1
she said plans for the redevelopment were on display for residents before any construction began and no concerns were raised prior to the work starting			2
she said : ' it is a matter of taste			0
some residents rave about it			2
for others it is a huge departure from where they lived before but not everybody hates it			0
' not impressed : mr @entity18 stands outside the newly refurbished flats where he has lived for more than 3 years			0
