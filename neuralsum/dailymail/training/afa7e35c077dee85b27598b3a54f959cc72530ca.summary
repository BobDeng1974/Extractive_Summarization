the taboo that sometimes still surrounds the subject of breastfeeding in public can leave many new mums feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable			2
while there are many places that happily accept that a nursing mother needs to feed her child when out and about , plenty of new mums still feel judged when doing so in public			2
one woman who wants to help stamp out those feelings is fertility expert and author @entity11 , who has opened her doors to new mums who want a cuppa while feeding their child and perhaps a little advice too			1
feeling comfortable : a new breastfeeding cafe will open in @entity19 , @entity20 and provide breastfeeding advice for new mums @entity11 has launched a drop in ' cafe ' service in @entity20 so these mums can receive midwifery help and breastfeeding advice in a welcoming atmosphere			1
@entity11 says , ' i breast fed both my children for over a year and personally i never experienced any problems and was never made to feel uncomfortable , but i do think it depends on the individual			1
' although i was always discrete i equally was more concerned with the needs of my babies than with other people 's prejudice			0
but i do know that not everyone feels this way , which is why i want to help women it they want to breastfeed			0
' breast is best : the breastfeeding cafe will help support mums and treat any underlying difficulties that they may have the idea of the cafe is that new mums can share advice and tea as well as benefiting from qualified medical care			1
@entity11 added : ' if they do n't feel like breastfeeding and they just want advice about feeding then that is ok too - we can support new mums in whatever way feels right to them			1
' the purpose of the cafe is not to hide women away , it is to give them a place to get good advice '			0
time for tea : fertility expert and author @entity11 , pictured , has launched a drop in service where mums can feel relaxed and welcome from september the cafe , which will cost £ 175 for a six month membership , will be able to support and help mums as well as treat the underlying reasons behind any difficulties experienced			1
unlike many other breastfeeding facilities and courses out there , where the post-natal attention is mainly based on the baby , @entity11 says her clinic concentrates on the mother 's needs and goes by the motto ' nourish the mother to nourish the child			2
' @entity11 says : ' at my clinic , the @entity86 , from where i have launched the breastfeeding cafe , we take an integrated approach			1
' that means women do n't just get advice on traditional methods of breastfeeding , but they get advice on foods , which improve milk supplies			0
' they can also benefit from acupuncture if need be to help with mastitis , lack of milk supplies and any other minor ailment			0
we teach women that by looking after themselves , they are able to look after their baby			0
' feeling relaxed : the breastfeeding cafe also provides acupuncture , nutritional support and traditional remedies to help restore a mother 's energy midwife @entity111 says : ' during the early days it can be overwhelming adjusting to motherhood and recovering from the birth			2
sometimes the early challenges of breastfeeding and understanding your baby 's feeding cues can be very confusing			0
' we can advise on correct position and attachment , managing wind and colic , how to increase milk supply , feeding plans , prevention and treatment of sore nipples , mastitis or engorgement			0
' we can also help with identification of tongue tie and referral for treatment and advice on conditions such as thrush if necessary '			0
@entity11 adds : ' i like nothing better than to see a mother feeding her baby when i know the difficult journey she went on to become a mother and how much she longed for that baby			2
