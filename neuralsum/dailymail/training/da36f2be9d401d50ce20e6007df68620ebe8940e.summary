these words from the cockpit of the missing plane were spoken - by co-pilot @entity11 - as it was leaving @entity47 - run airspace and being handed over to air traffic controllers in @entity249			1
the sign - off came after one of the plane 's data communication systems , which would have enabled it to be tracked beyond radar coverage , had been switched off , mr @entity48 said on sunday			2

investigators are likely to examine the recording for any signs of psychological stress .			0
