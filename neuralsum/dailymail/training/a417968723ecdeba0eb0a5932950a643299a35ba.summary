by @entity0 published : 18:05 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 03:04 est , 25 january 2013 trying to earn a living as a twentysomething , @entity1 could be found driving an ice cream van around @entity5			1
today , a mere six years after selling her last @entity6 , she is modestly ignoring all the plaudits crediting her as the main author of @entity10 ’s historic speech on @entity11			1
@entity1 , 31 , is said to have been the key @entity13 speechwriter behind such memorable phrases as ‘ it will be an in - out referendum ’ and mr @entity10 ’s stirring vow to fight ‘ heart and soul ’ to keep @entity17 in the @entity18			1
perhaps this is not surprising , since @entity1 is also a respected poet who has strong views on the power of public speaking			1
indeed , she has bemoaned the decline of rhetoric and the ‘ slow sterilisation of public debate ’ , which , she has said , risks ‘ impoverishing politics and perhaps endangering democracy itself ’			0
however , she has heaped praise on @entity45 for boldly entering no 10 for the first time as prime minister in may 1979 and launching her premiership with a quote from @entity50 ( ‘ where there is discord , may we bring harmony ; where there is error , may we bring truth ; where there is doubt , may we bring faith ; and where there is despair , may we bring hope			0
’ ) a winning way with words : @entity66 on her way to work at no 10 @entity1 has also despaired of what she calls ‘ antiseptic oratory ’ : where high - profile politicians ‘ must toe an invisible line when speaking in public ’			1
she says the result is ‘ political speech cleansed of anything remotely contentious , anything colourful , anything impulsive , anything that might be deemed offensive to anyone ’			0
@entity1 joined @entity10 ’s team four years ago			1
the only political speech writer in his inner circle , she crafted the first draft of this week ’s @entity11 speech at the end of last year			0
the text went through dozens of rewrites as it was passed around the no 10 team			2
then , in early in january , @entity1 added the last rhetorical flourishes			1
crucially , she understands @entity10 ’s instincts and vocabulary — to such an extent that colleagues have described her as ‘ the prime minister ’s larynx ’			1
because of her dark hair , she has been mistaken several times for @entity97 when entering and leaving no 10			0
( incidentally , like home secretary @entity98 , @entity1 is well - known for her love of leopard - print shoes			1
) in a rare interview before the last general election , she spoke about the dynamics of her working relationship with mr @entity10			1
‘ i ’ve picked up on how @entity10 talks just through listening to him , ’ she said			1
‘ i find it quite easy to get his tone			0
he ’s really straightforward and clear about what he wants from his speeches			0
and he ’s funny , too			0
’ @entity1 went on to say that a ‘ career highlight ’ was when the @entity94 used one of her jokes in a speech			1
working for @entity10 , she says , is ‘ friendly and buzzy , nothing like the tv satire @entity114 ’			1
as a ‘ special adviser ’ , @entity1 earns a taxpayer - funded salary of £ 63,000 and is a rare creature in @entity10 ’s @entity119 operation , which is mainly staffed by public school - educated types			1
a devout @entity122 , she went to a comprehensive school , gaining a @entity124 in @entity125 at @entity126 , followed by a masters in @entity128 at @entity129			0
after university , she set up her own @entity122 clothing company and designed the jewellery herself			0
the crucifix at the centre of the recent controversy over @entity136 banning a female employee from wearing it over her uniform was @entity1 ’s design			1
working for @entity10 , @entity1 says , is ' friendly and buzzy , nothing like the tv satire @entity114 ' @entity1 joined the @entity141 in 2003 , when @entity142 was prime minister and at the height of his leadership			1
the @entity145 were not only unpopular with voters but were also embroiled in yet another civil war following the overthrow of party leader @entity149			0
@entity1 is on the same traditionalist wing of the party as mr @entity149 , with her beliefs forged as a young girl when she watched her mother , a foster parent , care for children in their family home			2
she has said : ‘ i used to think about what happened to the children when they left care , and how the @entity163 works in terms of welfare			0
many of my views were closely allied to how the @entity141 think			0
’ straightforward : @entity1 has said @entity10 ( pictured speaking to the assembly of the @entity170 of the @entity171 in @entity172 ) is ' clear about what he wants from his speeches ' ' the prime minister 's larynx ' : @entity1 understands @entity10 's instincts and vocabulary			1
she crafted the first draft of this week 's @entity11 speech at the end of last year her @entity182 is very important to her and she is described as a ‘ down - to - earth , social conservative			2
’ as well as speech - writing , her duties include helping with @entity119 correspondence			0
after the death of the @entity191 ’ six - year - old son , @entity190 , in february 2009 , it was @entity1 who dealt with many of the sympathy letters sent by members of the public			1
one mother , who had also lost a child , described the reply from @entity13 ( written by @entity1 ) as the most ‘ moving ’ letter she had ever received			2
an accomplished poet , @entity1 won second prize in the online @entity128 competition in 2011 with a poem called @entity204 ( inspired by a visit to a military show )			2
in a blog on the competition page , there was no hint of her day - job			0
it simply read : ‘ @entity1 lives and works in @entity213			2
’ while she never mixes socially with @entity10 outside @entity119 , she is on call every other weekend and attends speech - writing sessions at @entity217			1
@entity1 joined @entity219 's campaign to be @entity213 mayor , and was then hired to be part of his team it was while selling ice creams that the seeds were sown for her political career			1
she took a part - time job with the @entity141 mp @entity228 , who was a key figure in the @entity230 , whose members support traditional values and oppose gay marriage			2
she later joined @entity219 ’s campaign to be @entity213 mayor , and was then hired to be part of his team at @entity235			2
in due course , a friend told her that a job was available with @entity10 , who was then @entity239			2
after four interviews she was selected			0
@entity219 was desperately disappointed to lose her			0
a few years ago , she set out her beliefs about what was important in political speeches			1
in an article for @entity246 website , she lamented the death of rousing political speech making			0
referring to her hatred of ‘ antiseptic oratory ’ , she said it had many causes			0
she believed it was the ‘ natural successor to spin ’ , and she attacked politicians for their reluctance to use rhetoric in case they were seen as ‘ pretentious ’			0
traditionalist : @entity1 is on the same wing of the party as @entity149			2
her beliefs were forged as a young girl when she watched her mother , a foster parent , care for children in their family home she said : ‘ so , though no less educated than @entity270 or @entity271 , they appeal to the lowest common denominator			0
‘ like private school kids shedding their blazer at the bus stop to look cool , they shed the heavy mantle of their education to emulate — and hopefully appeal to — an imaginary “ everyman ”			0
’ she also complained about the way the political class has devised its own language that means little to those outside the @entity285 bubble			0
thus people are called ‘ disadvantaged ’ instead of ‘ poor ’ ; ‘ vulnerable ’ instead of old or disabled ; communities are in need of ‘ cohesion ’ ; government must be ‘ joined - up ’			2
‘ when a politician ’s rhetorical range is limited to a narrow , muted vocabulary and uniform understatement , ’ she added , ‘ their listeners hear “ blah ”			0
part of a politician ’s job is to excite people — to engage them in the issues and encourage them to vote			0
’ as a result , this absence of integrity and oratorical skills offered a great opportunity for @entity10			2
her comments were made more than five years ago but they still resonate today			1
lucky man : @entity10 ( pictured walking away after making a speech on holding a referendum ) is fortunate to have @entity1 behind him ‘ @entity10 will only convince the electorate that the @entity141 are the natural party of government if he rouses the sleeping “ whole - souled , sentimental equipment ” that is the heart of @entity315 , and to do this he must scorn antiseptic oratory for a style that is both more grand and more genuine			1
’ she urged politicians to abandon cliches and to ‘ trust in the imagination and intelligence of the @entity17 people ’			0
above all , she urged mr @entity10 to ‘ be brave enough to speak with the safety - catch off ’ — which is precisely what he did on wednesday in delivering the speech of his life on @entity11			1
with the @entity328 , @entity1 , behind him , @entity10 is a very lucky man — and is clearly armed with the rhetorical weapons to vanquish any foe , whether they are on the @entity141 backbenches or in the corridors of @entity334 .			1

@entity1 said to be key @entity336 behind phrases such as ' it will be an in - out referendum '
