a @entity1 photographer has captured the mysterious behavior of @entity4 's devil rays shooting into the sky			1
@entity6 , 41 , took the stunning shots of the animals leaping more than 10 feet into the air in @entity10 on @entity1 's @entity12 coast			1
the photographer and conservationist looked on as the startling spectacle unfolded - where thousands of the rays swim together and burst into the air in unison			0
common theories include that the rays jump to remove parasites from their skin or as part of a mating ritual , though both male and female @entity4 's rays jump			2
one theory holds that the rays leap by accident because they are moving quickly beneath the water 's surface and do not realize that moving upwards will send them flying into the air			0
oceanographer @entity58 , for whom the animals were named in the 1980s , said ' they just jump for the joy of it			0
why should n't they jump for the joy ? ' jumping for joy : @entity58 , the oceanographer for whom the rays were named in the 1980s , likes to think his namesake leaps because it is happy acrobats of the sea : the rays are known for doing flips after they jettison themselves into the air and then landing flat on their bellies with a splat the rays are about three feet in wingspan and are called ' tortilla ' by local fisherman , according to science friday			0
the food - inspired name came from the animal 's acrobatic flips while in the air , which are followed by flat landings reminiscent of the @entity1 flatbread			0
' they are some of the great acrobats in the marine world , ' mr @entity6 said			0
though all species of devil rays jump out of the water , @entity4 's rays are the only type that do so while swimming around in groups , which can be as large as 250,000			1
the fish jump out of the water and flap their wings like birds regularly during mass migrations along the coast			0
rays - ing the bar : while other species of devil ray are known to jump , the @entity105 's devil ray is the only one that jumps while swimming in schools school 's out for summer : swarms of jumping @entity4 rays undergo mass migration along the @entity23 in groups as large as 250,000 known as @entity115 , the sea creatures are most commonly found along in the eastern @entity23 from @entity1 to @entity24			1
' seeing these devil rays jumping out of the water is something extraordinary , ' said mr @entity6 , who has been photographing @entity1 's coastal waters since 1994			1
the conservationist said that the sound of the rays hitting the water when they land creates a strange rain - like sound			2
' you can wake up very early in the morning and hear the noise almost in darkness , ' he said			0
soaking up the rays : the animals are found on the sunny coastlines of the eastern @entity23 from the @entity12 in @entity1 down to @entity134 @entity135 - ning on the sea : mr @entity6 says that the pattering of thousands of rays falling back into the water can sound like rain on the sea ' tortilla ' : fishermen who encounter the rays have nicknamed the small , flat creatures after the floury staple of traditional @entity1 food ' suddenly , when the sun starts coming out , all the ray silhouettes can be seen everywhere			1
' mr @entity6 said that at the jumping 's peak rays can be seen leaping for several miles , and ' sometimes the frenzy is so high that some of these animals can land on the boats			2
' though the teeming mass of @entity4 's rays are impressive , conservation group @entity156 says that the species is under threat			2
the large schools are susceptible to gillnet fishing , where nets are hung vertically to catch animals by their gills , where more than 60 @entity4 's devil rays can be caught in one net			1
not just any old @entity4 : the species is sometimes caught accidentally by gilnetting fishermen and has been listed as near - threatened by @entity156 the life aquatic : @entity6 , 41 , has been photographing and working with marine animals on @entity1 's @entity23 since 1994			1

@entity6 , 41 , has captured stunning shots of @entity4 's devil rays leaping off @entity1 's @entity12 coast
the reason for the jumping is unknown , though it could be to shake off parasites or *attract* mates
@entity4 's rays leap in unison and are only ray species to jump while migrating in groups as large as 250,000
mr @entity6 says that the patter of thousands of rays hitting the water can sound like rain
