a young woman who had four teeth removed and her jaw broken , fitted with metal plates and then realigned to fix her lifelong underbite has said she finally feels her face looks the way it was meant to - even though she did n't realise quite how much it would change her face			1
@entity9 , 24 , from @entity10 , had underbite correction surgery - known as orthognathic surgery - on the @entity13 at the age of 18 to remove the 2cm horizontal gap between her top and bottom front teeth that had made her self - conscious since the age of 10			1
speaking to @entity19 , @entity9 , who now works in marketing in the @entity22 , said her awkward underbite meant she was bullied as a child growing up in a small village in @entity26 , and that ' people often asked why my teeth did n't line up '			1
@entity9 graduating from @entity30 , after her surgery , left , and before the operation , right she said : ' my jaw was just growing in a way it should n't have been and i was really self - conscious about it			2
people did bully me a bit - my sister probably the most ! ' it was n't so much painful as really awkward to hold in that position , and it always felt more natural to have my mouth open than closed			0
' when she was 10 , @entity9 's orthodontist said hers was an ' extreme case ' , and that she should seriously think about having the surgery when she was 18 and her bones stopped growing , otherwise the problem was going to continue getting worse and worse			1
' because of that i always felt i had the wrong face , ' she said			0
' i knew i was going to have the operation so i was just waiting for it to be done so i could look like i was supposed to			0
' @entity9 , pictured after the operation , said : ' i always knew i was going to have the operation so i was just waiting for it to be done so i could look like i was supposed to ' @entity9 said : ' i suppose my reasons for having the surgery were partly aesthetic and partly because it was uncomfortable			2
but it was going to keep growing and i did n't want to wait and see how bad it might get ' @entity9 visited the orthodontist every three months growing up and had braces for 10 years			1
then , in 2009 , when she reached 18 and began studying at @entity30 , the visits became more frequent			2
' i went about once every week , and then in the run - up to the operation i had four of my top back teeth removed to make room for where my jaw would be afterwards , ' she said			1
she added : ' i suppose my reasons for having the surgery were partly aesthetic and partly because it was uncomfortable			2
but it was going to keep growing and i did n't want to wait and see how bad it might get			0
' @entity9 in the weeks immediately following the operation , when her face swelled up @entity9 in the months following the operation , before her face swelling subsided , left , and the passport photo which led to her being stalled in customs in @entity79 after officials refused to believe it was her @entity9 spoke to a number of people who 'd had the surgery - which costs between £ 4,000 and £ 5,000 if done privately - and others who 'd had operations to correct overbites , and says she was n't at all nervous , having prepared herself for the procedure for almost a decade			1
the operation - which was last week reported in @entity19 to be on the rise among women in @entity93 - involved staying two nights in hospital			1
while there , @entity9 was put asleep under general anaesthetic while surgeons cut away the skin between her gums and her jaw to break the jawbone , fit it with metal plates and reposition it correctly , sewing her gums back together with stitches			1
@entity9 pictured after surgery , left , and before , right , when she was self - conscious about her face and people often asked why her teeth did n't fit together properly before having the operation @entity9 says she was self - conscious about her face , and always felt it did n't look the way it was supposed to they also made a hole in her chin into which they weaved a tube so @entity9 could breathe during the operation			1
' when i woke up and the painkillers wore off it was rather sore , ' she said			0
' then the next day my face swelled up and the bottom half was really black and bruised			0
' @entity9 's mouth was held together with elastic bands for one month to set her teeth and keep the stitches in place , and she could only drink through a straw ( ' i ate quite a lot of processed spinach ! ' )			2
@entity9 said : ' it 's improved my confidence and made me happier - but having seen how long the healing process is i do n't think i 'll be getting any more cosmetic surgery for a while ... ' she spent a week resting in bed , took one week off university , then bravely returned to class , even though doctors said she would probably be bed - bound for a month			1
' the healing process for the operation is quite long - it took seven months for the swelling to subside completely - but i could still walk so i decided to go back			0
even though i could n't speak and nobody recognised me			0
i had to wave to communicate with people			0
speaking about the way her new face looks , @entity9 said : ' everybody asks if i had an identity crisis after my face changed - and it 's true that i did n't realise quite how much it would change - but because the recovery took so long i got used to my new face gradually			2
' it 's funny how nobody recognises me - it can be quite a good thing when i want to avoid old friends back in @entity161 ! - but i also look completely different on my passport which led to me being held up in @entity79 in customs recently because they did n't believe i was me ! ' @entity9 , pictured post-operation , says her friends think her new face is an improvement and her family are really pleased for her when asked how the operation changed her life , she said : ' i do n't feel it changed my life too much , though i do prefer the way i look now - i do n't miss my old face at all ! i feel this is what my face was meant to look like all along			1
my friends think it 's an improvement and my family are really pleased for me			2
' i 'm also lucky that i 've managed to avoid most of the side effects			0
some people report completely losing feeling in their face , and i only really lost a tiny bit in my chin			0
' i would definitely recommend the operation to anyone who needed it			0
it 's improved my confidence and made me happier - but having seen how long the healing process is i do n't think i 'll be getting any more cosmetic surgery for a while ... '			0
