by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 is still hopeful a deal for @entity4 can be done but the @entity6 manager admitted complications were arising because of agents , who he said were ‘ coming out of the woodwork ’			1
signing the @entity10 international , 34 , is a priority given injuries to central midfielders @entity15 and @entity16 , who will both miss the trip to @entity18 on saturday			1
a two - year contract is on the cards for @entity4 , but @entity2 is experiencing the added difficulties of securing players in the @entity23 as opposed to the @entity24			1
@entity25 : @entity4 , who played more than 300 games for @entity25 , is wanted by @entity6 manager : @entity2 guided @entity6 back to the @entity23 after a 10 - year absence ‘ we ’ve not really made too much progress on that as we stand but i ’m hopeful something can be done , ’ he said			1
‘ unfortunately at times it ’s a complicated process , there appear to be representatives coming out of the woodwork			2
‘ it ’s a case of working out who represents who and adding strength to the squad			2
‘ there are more potential representatives because the profile of any club in top flight has more media exposure , so there are greater chances of details around deals to be leaked			0
‘ we ’re still trying to look in markets where there is n’t a general interest , not chasing players where its common ground for many clubs			0
‘ it ’s proving to be difficult , it has been all summer , but i ’m very clear on the fact it ’s very important for us to acquire players who will be right for us			0
‘ i do n’t intend in last few days adding for the sake of it			0
we continue to recruit with standards we always have done			0
‘ it ’s fair to say we could do with one or two more but that ’s not to say i ’m not pleased with the payers we have already			0
