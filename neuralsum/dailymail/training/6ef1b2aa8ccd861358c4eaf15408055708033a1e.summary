this is the moment a woman believes that the meteorite which streaked across the @entity4 's skies at the weekend crashed to earth			1
the partner of florist @entity7 , 43 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , saw a bright light in the sky followed by a loud explosion			1
the light was so bright it was captured on @entity13 , reflected in the windows of neighbouring houses			2
a still image taken from a @entity13 camera at the home of @entity7 from @entity8 , which shows , circled , what she believes is the meteor that blazed across @entity22 on saturday night impact : @entity7 thinks she is holding the meteor that blazed across the sky on saturday night then @entity7 found the melon - sized black rock in a field outside her house			1
@entity7 said : ‘ my partner was outside letting the dog out on saturday night and he saw something just after midnight			1
' he thought it was a firework , but there was no noise , then , just a little bit of crackling as it came down			2
’ charred : @entity37 says the rock has the ' small white chondrules ' which are found on meteorites she added : ‘ we ’ve looked it up on the internet and it looks like one			2
it ’s heavy and it has what looks like " small white chondrules " described on the internet			2
‘ we ’ve seen pictures of them where they ’ve hit cars on the internet and done quite a bit of damage			2
’ the rock does appear to fit the description of other meteorites which have hit the earth			2
many of them are tiny - about the size of a pea - even though they can generate incredible brightness while they are subjected to the astonishing heat of penetrating the earth 's atmosphere			2
once they finally hit the ground , the meteorite is likely to appear scorched , having reached thousands of degrees @entity73 , and could be almost any shape			2
most meteors are made up of a collection of dust and tiny mineral grains which have been floating in space since the solar system formed			2
only around six per cent are made of iron			2
but dr @entity82 , reader in @entity83 at the @entity84 , has poured cold water on the theory it could be the meteorite , or a fragment of it			0
he said : ' this is unlikely to be the meteorite as it was spotted travelling much farther south across @entity91			1
' it ’s not clear whether any of it did make it to the ground but if it did the likely location would be farther south			0
' thousands of stargazers witnessed a spectacular meteor shower last night , as a large fireball streaked across the night sky for more than 30 seconds			1
the brilliant display entranced watchers at several locations across @entity91 , including @entity104 , @entity105 and the @entity106 - but now the question on astronomers ' minds is where the shooting star fell to earth			1
amazing : the stunning meteor is captured shooting across the sky behind a laser show in @entity116 , @entity117			0
the shot was taken by amateur photographer @entity119 using time - lapse photography a spectacular shot of the meteor taken by amateur astronomer @entity123 in northern @entity124 reports of a ' bright light ' and an ' orange glow ' were received by police across @entity124 and the north of @entity91 at about 9.40pm yesterday , and the meteor was believed to be brightening as it moved south			1
while it first appeared 150 miles above @entity124 , the fist - sized chunk of rock descended to an altitude of about 80 miles above @entity135 and @entity136			1
meteors often burn up as they travel through the earth 's atmosphere , but experts believe this one may have reached the earth 's surface intact because of its size			1
charts showing its route across the sky suggest the shooting star was travelling at about seven kilometres per second , and may have splashed down in the @entity148 or the @entity149 - meaning the chances of finding it are slim			1
@entity152 , a member of online astronomy group @entity153 , said he had spotted the object in @entity155 , and that it had been seen as far south as @entity156			0
he added : ' it had a very bright orange nucleus and a green tail			0
it was seen by hundreds , maybe thousands of people			0
' star bright : close up of meteor taken by @entity123 who took this photo when he was studying the aurora the meteor 's appearance last night prompted a flurry of worried phone calls to the police , as people mistook the fireball for a burning plane			1
the @entity175 tweeted : ' hi all , for anyone seeing something in the night sky , we believe it was a meteorite			0
' the @entity182 also reported the sighting of a ' huge fireball ' travelling from north to south over @entity185			1
the @entity186 posted on @entity187 : ' of 30 years observing the sky , fireball best thing i have ever seen period			1
' starstruck : the meteor , visible in the top right hand corner of this image as an elongated white streak , was seen in the skies across the north of @entity91 and was spotted as far south as @entity199 @entity200 : in this video footage the meteor arrives at the top left of the screen meteors are particles from space that burn up in a streak of light as they enter the @entity212 's atmosphere , whereas meteorites are larger objects that survive the trip and reach the surface of the @entity212			1
dr @entity217 , an author and astronomer , said the object was probably the debris of a planet that had never properly formed			0
' it 's a chunk of rock that 's probably come from somewhere between @entity224 and @entity225 , and has been in space for thousands of millions of years , ' he said			1
' there are tens of thousands of bits of rock and grains of sand orbiting between @entity224 and @entity225			0
some of it comes out of that orbit and some of it hits the @entity212			0
' amateur astronomer @entity123 spotted the bright light while taking photos of the aurora in @entity238 , near @entity239			0
stargazing : the shooting star photographed over @entity241 photographed by @entity242 blazing a trail : this map shows the meteor 's approximate route across the night sky @entity123 , 48 , who works as a meteorologist , captured the image with a @entity250 , 15 second exposure			1
he said : ' it looked like it was moving south or southwest , whilst brightening			0
' @entity119 , an amateur photographer from @entity254 , managed to capture a stunning image of the meteorite against the backdrop of the ' @entity258 ' - a laser display by artist @entity260 installed in @entity116 to celebrate the @entity261 in the north - east of @entity91			1
mr @entity119 , 49 , a @entity262 for @entity263 in @entity264 , said : ' i was standing with my friend when we saw a bright light in the sky moving really fast			0
' i was there to photograph the laser show in @entity116 , but the light caught my eye so i turned the camera around			0
' at first i thought it was a firework , then my friend said he thought it was a meteor or comet - i caught the white light and an orange glowing tail in my picture			0
' i managed to capture the trail it left because i took my photo with a long exposure			0
' the light was heading north to south			0
it lasted thirty seconds or more , it was really spectacular			0
' we waited around to see if we would see anything else , but it was over very quickly			0
' hundreds of people took to @entity187 to report where they had seen the shower and @entity152 , of @entity294 , said he had seen reports of sightings from @entity124 to @entity156			1
he spotted the meteor in @entity155 and believed it could have gone down in the @entity149 or the @entity148 .			0

*eyewitness* reports of a large fireball travelling from northern @entity124 to southern @entity91 at around 9.40pm on saturday
some phoned police *fearing* plane had crashed
experts describe fireball as *highlight* of 30 years ' stargazing
