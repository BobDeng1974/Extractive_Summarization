' we keep getting told the average lifespan ( for a manager ) is 13 months and another good young manager has just lost his job			0

in terms of results he 's been terrific			0
' i 've been in management for 15 years now and two or three people have lost their jobs in the last 48 hours so i 'm going to take a deep breath and enjoy the occasion			1
