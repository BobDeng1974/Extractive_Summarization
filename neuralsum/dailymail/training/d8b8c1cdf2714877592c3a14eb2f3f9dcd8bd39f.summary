by @entity0 published : 03:56 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 19:32 est , 11 january 2013 a mechanic appears to have predicted the circumstances surrounding his own death when he died from a heart attack after completing work on converting a @entity7 campervan into a hearse			1
@entity9 , 50 , had joked that the job would ' be the death of him ' but then he became the first person to use it			2
mr @entity9 had carried out the work for his friend @entity16 's business , @entity17			1
after the fatal cardiac arrest he was driven for his own funeral from @entity20 and @entity21 in @entity22 to @entity23 in @entity24			1
rest in peace : @entity16 , pictured , stands with the @entity7 hearse his friend @entity9 built before he died and was driven in it from his funeral tragic : @entity9 , pictured , worked on the campervan hearse before suffering a fatal heart attack last month mr @entity16 said : ' that was always his line , he would always joke that i worked him too hard and the campervan would be the end of him			1
' that 's what 's so ironic about him dying and now he is the first person to use the hearse on his final day			0
' mr @entity16 has been hiring out another @entity7 campervan for weddings for some time			2
after seeing how happy the quirky vehicle made people , he decided to create a hearse version , and asked @entity9 to help him tart up a rusty old turquoise combie van			2
' i get a great reaction from people when i use it , i get smiles and waves from the public , it just makes people happy , ' the 42 - year - old @entity47 man said			0
' i thought i could use it on someone 's final day , the hearse is n't black , it 's white , and makes funerals a bit less sad			0
' best friend : @entity16 , pictured with the camper , was devastated by the sudden loss of his pal @entity9 bright white : mr @entity16 , pictured in the camper , said a bright white campervan makes funerals less happy mr @entity9 , a mechanic who restored cars for a living , was happy to help but after completing the project suffered a fatal heart attack , which devastated his family and friends			0
' what you saw was what you got with @entity9 , he was a funny guy , he would n't harm anyone and it 's just a shame that he 's gone , ' mr @entity16 said			0
' it just not something you would expect , he did n't smoke or drink and he was a fit guy , he worked constantly , ' mr @entity16 thought using the campervan hearse at mr @entity9 's funeral would be a fitting tribute , and he reckons his best mate would have loved the attention			1
' i thought to myself , is it insensitive to mention the campervan to his family ? but his partner @entity92 was over the moon with the idea - she actually thanked me in her speech at the crematorium , so i think it was a very good celebration of his life			0
' procession : mr @entity9 , 50 , was carried from @entity100 in @entity101 to @entity102 in @entity47 in the campervan hearse he built for mr @entity16 , pictured			1
