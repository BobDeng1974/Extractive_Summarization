it does not get any more emphatic than this			0
@entity3 , so desolate after @entity2 ’s , were utterly irresistible			2
@entity4 , with such an opportunity to make history in this series after going one up , were pathetic			1
what a turnaround for @entity11 and @entity3 since they went one down in the second test with a last - day collapse that saw knives being increasingly sharpened for the captain and all those involved in their rebuilding programme			1
what an embarrassment for @entity21 and @entity4 as they contemplate their total surrender at @entity24 to follow equally abject displays at @entity26 and @entity27			1
that ’s what has made their players millionaires			0
there can rarely have been a more one - sided day than this , more so even than the third in @entity79 which saw @entity4 lose nine wickets in a session despite @entity40 being injured , @entity51 being ill and a hurricane on the way that would have washed out the last two days			1
from the first ball on sunday @entity3 were supreme , pretty much as they have been ever since @entity11 started turning things around with both bat and his captaincy at the @entity89			2
they have won just about every session since			0
how purposeful was batting that , led by @entity61 and featuring a courageous cameo from @entity40 , smashed another 101 runs in just 11.3 overs on the third day to take @entity3 ’s lead up to a commanding 338			1
@entity4 would not have got past that if they had been given three more innings , let alone another one			1
as it was they lasted a mere 29.2 overs , barely a session , with only a shower enabling them to hold out until 4.22pm and the humiliation of being bowled out for 94			2
it was @entity4 who were the biggest shower			0
in their last five innings they mustered 178 , 152 , 161 , 148 and now double figures , worse even than @entity3 ’s harrowing performances in @entity38			1
how to explain it ? yes , @entity4 have been terrible but it would be wrong to take anything away from @entity3			1
there had been near misses and promise all season , as there will be with any virtually new side , but from @entity26 onwards the senior spine delivered the goods and that made all the difference			0
magnificent : @entity61 celebrates his century on his way to making 149 in @entity3 's innings of 486 commanding : @entity61 's stunning knock ended any chance of @entity4 winning the test deadly throw : @entity130 gets a pat on the back from @entity61 and captain @entity11 after running out @entity4 's @entity134 for just three runs hitting out : @entity61 smashes the ball to the boundary during his knock of 149 lonely walk : @entity55 captain @entity21 makes his way back after being dismissed for a duck now they are looking like a team again , one with the perfect mix of exciting emerging players and experienced ones at the top of their game			1
certainly @entity51 and @entity40 now seem as potent as any new - ball pairing in @entity3 ’s history while @entity151 has finally become a leader rather than follower			1
then there is the captain			0
few @entity3 skippers can have suffered as much opprobrium as @entity11 when the bitter @entity159 aftermath threatened to engulf him			0
he was close to packing it all in after the fourth day against @entity161 at @entity162 when he had a nightmare in the field but , after vowing not to be a quitter , he has shown immense character in fighting back			0
proud : the 3 - 1 series win has alleviated much of the pressure on @entity3 captain @entity11 cheerio : @entity51 waves to the dismissed @entity64 as @entity60 , @entity11 and @entity151 rush in to celebrate the wicket reflexes : @entity174 runs out @entity175 as @entity3 wrapped up their 3 - 1 series victory video coach @entity177 praises ' outstanding ' @entity3 this 3 - 1 victory and @entity11 ’s return to something near his best form cements him as @entity3 ’s captain for next year ’s ashes , barring a complete collapse in fortunes , and he has visibly grown as a leader over the last three @entity187			1
he will certainly have relished the final rites of this @entity190 series			0
what a batsman @entity61 has grown into this year , his unbeaten 149 taking his series average to 103 while the speed of his runs ran @entity4 ragged			1
and what character , too , from @entity40 , who came out to bat with his nose broken in two places little more than a week ago and proceeded to flay the inevitable short - pitched bowling that came his way to all parts of @entity24			2
he struck 37 from 21 balls and in a flash @entity3 had got up to 486 all out			2
could @entity4 at least show some fight , a little application to restore a semblance of pride for the millions of fans in their cricket - mad country ? not a bit of it			2
they batted like a village side to collapse to their third crunching defeat , their second by an innings and their third heaviest hammering of all time			0
do n't look back in anger : @entity221 glances as @entity222 parries the ball for @entity151 ( left ) to catch him for seven runs running away with it : @entity60 celebrates after the catch is taken to remove @entity221 another one bites the dust : @entity40 celebrates after removing @entity229 for four runs timing : @entity61 watches the ball intently before hitting @entity232 to the boundary for four floored : @entity232 ends up on the ground as @entity61 attends to the wicket next to him @entity51 needed six victims to overtake sir @entity237 and become @entity3 ’s leading @entity187 wicket - taker but could manage just two thanks to the collective effort of the attack			1
he will not mind that and must now wait until his 100th test in @entity244 next april for his crowning moment			0
@entity40 , who had such a poor game at @entity247 , was a menacing accomplice to @entity51 while here , unlike at @entity27 , the supporting cast of @entity60 and @entity130 were almost as dangerous , @entity60 sent @entity4 hurtling to their demise with four wickets for 17 in just 19 balls			1
thrashed is an under - statement			0
@entity3 will confirm on monday that @entity11 will carry on as one - day captain for the start of the build - up to february ’s @entity257 , and why not ? after rising to the biggest challenge of his career he has earned the right to do that			2
bigger than the @entity257 , of course , are the @entity263 and it will not be long before @entity38 come calling again			0
bring on the @entity264 ? well , @entity3 have some way to go before we can say that but there is promise that they can regain the urn now when as recently as last month there was little more than despair			0
crisis , what crisis ?			0

@entity3 wrapped up 3 - 1 series victory over @entity4 in style at @entity24
sorry @entity4 were bowled out for 94 in their second innings
@entity3 win the fifth test by an innings and 244 runs

earlier , @entity61 hit 149 not out as @entity3 posted 486
