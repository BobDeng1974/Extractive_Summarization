@entity2 , of @entity13 , @entity14 , burgled the home of her mother and father three times in a month - in one raid stealing a gold and diamond bracelet plus a £ 4,000 @entity22 watch			1
she was let off by a judge - but just four weeks after her mother @entity24 criticised the suspended custody term and warned she would back in trouble , @entity2 went on a shoplifting spree			1
the single mother of two was caught stealing wine , beer and spirits , but said she did it because she wanted to go to prison , adding : ‘ i fancy a roof over my head and three square meals a day			1
’ a court heard she also then did not not turn up for probation appointments and instead helped herself to a charity box from a takeaway			1
today she was finally behind bars after a judge said yesterday that she had ‘ thrown back ’ numerous opportunities that were given to her			1
she had earlier turned up several hours late for her hearing at @entity3 scruffily dressed , clutching a @entity46 shopping bag and a lighted cigarette with ink on the back of her hand			2
her father @entity52 , 46 , a company director , attended the court hearing with another of his daughters during the morning - but they left thinking @entity2 would not turn up			1
the court heard @entity57 and mrs @entity2 , 45 , had been deliberately targeted by her - even though they had tried to help her financially , bought her a flat and looked after her two young children			2
she would invade her parents ’ £ 300,000 rural home in @entity61 , @entity14 , when they were out			1
in one break - in , her own children ’s toys were showered with glass and had to be thrown away			0
mr and mrs @entity2 , whose three other daughters are an accountant , a company manager and a university student , later told police they were disgusted with their daughter ’s behaviour			2
they called for her to be locked up and said they had never had any problems with any of their other children			0
thefts : @entity2 would invade her parents ' £ 300,000 rural home in @entity61 , @entity14 , when they were out			1
in one break - in , her own children 's toys were showered with glass and had to be thrown away but last march she was given a 22 - month prison term suspended for two years after she admitted three burglaries			1
she promised there had been a ‘ seachange ’ in her behaviour			0
dad : @entity88 , 46 , father of @entity2 , is pictured outside the court , where she was sentenced but at the time housewife mrs @entity2 , whose husband runs an energy company , said : ‘ the suspended sentence was a joke and she will see this as a reason to do it all again			1
‘ it will either be us or someone else she knows			0
most people would be ashamed of themselves if they behaved this way but not our daughter			0
‘ she is uncaring and cold and it ’s about time she got severely punished , because she needs a wake - up call			0
anybody who she comes into contact with she falls out with because something has gone missing			0
' we ’ve tried to help her , teachers have tried to help her , and psychologists have tried to help her			0
but it ’s been no use			0
the thieving has gone on for donkeys years , and going to court was our last resort - we just could n’t go on			0
’ just weeks after the suspended sentence was imposed , @entity2 stole cider , wine , lager , @entity121 and vodka from four shops in @entity124 , @entity14 between april 14 and may 4			1
she was challenged twice , swore at one assistant , said : ‘ get out of my way ’ , and walked out of the premises			0
ten days after that , on may 14 , she was given a chance to attend supervision appointments but on june 10 , she pinched the charity box , containing cash for local mosques , and ran away			1
it was later retrieved from behind the fridge at an address where she was staying			0
she was arrested and questioned and denied being responsible for each and every one of the thefts			0
@entity2 continued to claim she was not involved , even when shown @entity140 - claiming shopkeepers were wrong			2
she admitted six counts of theft and breaching the suspended custody term			1
custody : @entity2 ( pictured left in her police mugshot and right in a family photograph ) , 20 , of @entity13 , @entity14 , was finally behind bars today after a judge said that she had ' thrown back ' numerous opportunities @entity150 , defending , said his client had ‘ had a very difficult relationship with her mother			1
’ he added : ‘ for the last couple of weeks , for the first time in many years , the defendant and her mother have begun to make the tentative first steps towards building bridges in their relationship			2
‘ she tells me for the first time her mother is beginning to make arrangements for her to play an active and positive role in the lives of her children			2
’ mr @entity150 said @entity2 committed the thefts while subject to the suspended sentence because she wanted to go to prison , rather than feared it			1
mother and daughter : a family photograph of @entity2 ( centre ) and her mother @entity173 ( right ) he said : ‘ she was homeless			1
the idea of a roof over her head and three square meals a day was not something she was particularly fearful of			0
' you have really thrown back at me the opportunity i gave you ' judge @entity183 ' now her life is beginning to turn around			2
she is all too aware of the difficulties she must overcome to build a stable and structured life for herself and her children			0
’ sentencing , judge @entity183 said she clearly had ‘ multitudinous problems ’ , but had left him with little option			2
he said the final theft was committed after he gave her a last chance to comply with supervision			0
she will serve her sentence in a @entity198			0
the judge added : ‘ in effect , by committing that offence and attending only two supervision appointments , you have really thrown back at me the opportunity i gave you			2
it ’s inevitable a custodial sentence must follow			0
