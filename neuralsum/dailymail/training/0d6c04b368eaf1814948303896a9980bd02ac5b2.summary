i 'm sure the people that lived there , you know , @entity15 's family had a lot to do with that			1
' at around half past midnight the pair finished studying and @entity15 walked @entity16 to her car			1
she put her gun and bulletproof vest inside the vehicle and went back to give @entity15 a goodnight hug			1
suddenly they heard a screech of tyres and @entity16 looked up to see two men with guns drawn walking towards them			1

" ' my mind just went into police mode			1
what am i going to do to keep everybody in this house safe ... and get them out ? ' i was constantly peeking at them , trying to memorise their features , what they were wearing , any kind of description i could give to the police			1
' one of ' em was wearing a red hoodie and dark pants			1
the other one was wearing a black hoodie			2
' with one of the men holding @entity16 and @entity15 on the ground at gunpoint , the other went upstairs where grandmother @entity54 , aunt @entity135 , cousin @entity94 and her two children @entity136 and @entity138 were in bed			1
@entity23 awoke to a menacing black handgun being waved in her face and was ordered to carry a heavy , old - fashioned television downstairs set with her			2

' they just yelled back " i 'll kill you bitch , shut up put your head on the ground			2
" ' with tears streaming down her face @entity23 begged @entity16 to do something			2

" ' i looked down the barrel of the gun ... and with everything that i had in me , i lunged towards the guy with the black hoodie and -- and just began to fight			2
