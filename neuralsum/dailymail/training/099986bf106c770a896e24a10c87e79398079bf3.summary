despite more than 5,000 extra prosecutions in the year to june only 77 more sex offenders were convicted			1
it means that just six out of 10 prosecutions for sex offences resulted in a prosecution - down from 70 per cent the year before			1
@entity15 claimed more offenders were getting away with their crimes and blamed @entity19 cuts to police officers and specialist prosecutors for a failure to deal with complex sex crimes			2
the figures show there were 34,161 sex offence prosecutions in the year ending june 2014 , with 19,685 resulting in a conviction			2
but a similar number of sex offenders - 19,608 - were convicted in the year ending june 2013 , despite only 28,809 prosecutions , more than 5,000 fewer			1
in contrast the conviction rate for every other serious crime apart from robbery increased or remained the same over the same period			0
the release of the figures in the @entity38 's quarterly criminal justice statistics comes as the prosecution and conviction of sexual offenders remains high on the political agenda after a string of high profile cases			2
shadow home secretary @entity0 said the government should establish national standards on the prosecution of sex crimes			2
she said : ‘ these figures show the government is failing to get justice for victims of sexual attacks and abuse			0
‘ more sex offenders are getting away with it , and fewer victims are getting the justice and protection they need			0
the scale of cuts to police officers and specialist prosecutors under @entity62 means they are struggling to cope with complex crimes			0

‘ @entity70 is on hand to provide them with the help and support they need			0
‘ agencies across the criminal justice system must address this drop in conviction rates , not least as sexual offences have some of the lowest conviction rates compared to other crimes			0
