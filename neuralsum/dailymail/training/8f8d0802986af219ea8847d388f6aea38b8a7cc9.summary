a space telescope so huge it could spot sign of alien life has been given the go ahead			2
the @entity3 ( e-elt ) will have a primary mirror 39 meters ( 43 yards ) in diameter , allowing it to gather around 15 times more light than the largest optical telescopes now functioning			1
the tip of a mountain high in the @entity10 desert was removed in june so site clearance could get under way , with the telescope slated to reach ' first light ' in 2024			1
' there is already a lot of progress in @entity10 on the summit of @entity35 and the next few years will be very exciting			1
' the telescope will have a dome that covers an area the size of a stadium			0
it has a sensitivity to visible and infrared light tens of times greater than any previous telescope , and is designed to help astronomers peer back to the first galaxies 14 billion years ago			1
this could unlock secrets of dark matter and dark energy – little - understood forces in space – to help explain how the universe evolved , according to the plans			0
however , the telescope that will be the world 's largest when completed could face a delay to start - up as its @entity58 backers wait for @entity60 to commit to the funding needed for it to be fully operational			1
but that could now be delayed until 2026 , said its operators the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) on thursday			0
full funding of construction is dependent on @entity60 becoming the first @entity70 country to join the @entity30 , but that has not yet happened			0
the telescope will have a dome that covers an area the size of a @entity76 has a sensitivity to visible and infrared light tens of times greater than any previous telescope , and is designed to help astronomers peer back to the first galaxies 14 billion years ago			1
the process is under way but still needs to gain congressional approval in @entity60 , where support for it has been patchy			0
' it became clear by mid- 2014 that the ongoing day - to - day delay was posing an increasing risk to the project and to the scientific aspirations of the @entity30 community , ' said the @entity30 in a report of a meeting its council held this week			0
the organization has responded by dividing the construction into two phases			0
it gave the green - light this week to the first phase , which implies spending of around 1 billion euros ( $ 1.2 billion ) and does not require @entity60 's participation			1
that will mean it can begin building , with contracts for the dome , main structure and some instruments due to be awarded next year			0
the @entity3 will be a 39 - metre aperture optical and infrared telescope sited on @entity18 in the @entity10 @entity20 ( pictured ) , 20 kilometres from @entity30 's @entity112 on @entity113			1
it will be the world 's largest ' eye on the sky ' however , unless additional funds can be identified , the two - step phase means completion could be delayed to 2026 , it said			1
should @entity60 finish its ratification - and start paying its 130 million - euro accession fee - by early 2017 , then the @entity30 said it should be able to stick to its original plan			0
the telescope is one of three vying to be the world 's biggest			0
also in contention are the @entity127 and the @entity128			0
astronomers hope to use these super-telescopes to look at the first stars and galaxies that formed after the @entity134 13.7 billion years ago			1
they also plan to uncover life - threatening asteroids heading towards the planet and spot @entity138 - like and potentially habitable worlds in orbit around other stars			0
the race will see sophisticated observatories built on top of mountains in @entity145 and @entity10 in an attempt to see the wonders hiding in the outer reaches of the cosmos astronomers around the world are going head to head to develop three major telescopes that will be at least 10 times more powerful than anything in operation today			1
@entity157 : @entity158 in @entity159 : $ 700 million ( £ 420 million ) status : to be completed within 10 @entity161 : @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 the @entity165 : @entity167 's peak in @entity168 : € 1bn ( £ 900m ) status : to be completed around @entity170 : @entity171 , @entity172 ( @entity172 ) and the @entity173 ( @entity173 ) the @entity174 : @entity20 , @entity175 : € 1bn ( £ 900m ) status : start of operation is planned for early @entity179 : @entity30 and being the first to complete their projects is crucial			0
the telescopes are expected to open windows into scientific mysteries that have stumped scientists for centuries			2
the @entity127 ( gmt ) , for instance , is currently under construction atop @entity189 in @entity10 at an altitude of 8,366 ft ( 2,550 metres ) above sea level			0
the @entity127 is a $ 700 million ( £ 420 million ) project being funded by the @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 and expected to be operation in around 10 years			2
it will be made up of seven 27.6 ft ( 8.4 metre ) diameter segments , and is expected to have over 5 - 10 times the light - gathering ability of existing instruments			1
the design for @entity3 followed plans for something known as the @entity202 ( @entity202 ) which was hoped to have an aperture of 100 metres , the same distance that @entity205 ran in 9.58 seconds			1
an artist 's impression of the @entity58 and extremely large telescope shows the @entity209 gleaming behind the telescope however , @entity202 had to be scrapped because of its overwhelmingly expensive budget , but @entity30 said it may still be built sometime in the future			0
the final contender is the € 1bn ( £ 900m ) @entity128 which had plans for its 2022 operation approved last year			0
it is being constructed on @entity167 's peak in @entity145 which already hosts about a dozen telescopes			2
the $ 1bn ( £ 900m ) @entity128 had plans for its 2022 operation approved last year the dormant volcano is popular with astronomers because its summit is well above the clouds at 13,796 feet , offering a clear view of the sky above for 300 days a year			2
the telescope 's segmented primary mirror , which is nearly 100 feet ( 30 metres ) long , will give it nine times the collecting area of the largest optical telescopes in use today			1
its images will also be three times sharper			2
it should help scientists see some 13 billion light years away for a glimpse into the early years of the universe			1
all three telescopes ' websites leave the exact projected date of their completion unknown , expressing the stating will be completed and conducting actual science by 2022 .			2

the @entity3 ( e-elt ) will have a primary mirror 39 meters ( 43 yards ) in diameter
will be able to gather around 15 times more light than the largest optical telescopes now functioning
will help astronomers peer back to first galaxies 14 billion years ago
