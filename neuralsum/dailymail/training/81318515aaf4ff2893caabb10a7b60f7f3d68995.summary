early risers across much of @entity1 were treated to pink skies as a @entity4 research rocket launched into the atmosphere			0
the rocket blasted off from @entity7 in @entity8 at 5:26 am local time ( 12.26 gmt )			1
a bright pink cloud was visible for the next 20 minutes as sunlight hit the rocket 's vapour trail			1
early risers across @entity1 were treated to pink skies as a @entity4 research rocket launched into the atmosphere			0
a bright pink cloud was visible for the next 20 minutes as sunlight hit the rocket 's vapour trail news outlets in @entity1 reported that residents in @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 reported seeing the pink cloud			1
the @entity27 rocket carried an atmospheric - research payload designed by scientists and engineers at a space - vehicles research lab at @entity32 in @entity33			0
the white ' tracer cloud ' was made up of trimethyl aluminum , and the red cloud , consisted of lithium vapour			1
@entity7 officials said the rocket 's release of vapour into the near - vacuum of space was intended to help study processes responsible for the formation of the @entity47 's ionosphere			1
this photo shows a @entity50 research rocket that launched from @entity7 @entity7 officials said the rocket 's release of vapour into the near - vacuum of space was intended to help study processes responsible for the formation of the @entity47 's ionosphere that 's a region of space where electrons naturally separate from molecules and float separately to create an ionised gas			1
the ionosphere is a crucial layer of charged particles surrounding our planet			1
this layer serves as the medium through which high frequency radio waves – such as those sent down to the ground by global positioning system ( gps ) satellites or , indeed , any satellite communicating with @entity47 – travel			2
the ionosphere begins about 60 miles above the ground and is filled with electrons and ions			2
after releasing the rocket , researchers then visually observed the movement of the vapour as it traces the motions of background environment			2
this will help scientists better understand and predict the electrical storms in @entity47 's upper atmosphere			2
gps signal delays caused by activity in the ionosphere are measured in metres , with large delays being on the order of 40 metres , says @entity93 , senior technologist with the @entity94 at @entity95			2
while it does n't take long for signals traveling at the speed of light to cover 40 metres , he says , even a delay of a small fraction of a second can make a significant difference in determining the position of a fast - moving plane			0
' it is crucial to bound the positioning errors accurately for landing an aircraft safely in fog , for example , ' he said			0
@entity4 likens this technique to injecting a small , harmless dye into a river or stream , to study its currents , eddies , and other motions			0
the rocket was provided under a @entity118 test program at @entity32 , while a @entity4 rocket program provided technical expertise for its assembly and other parts of the mission			0
the launch was postponed from monday because of weather			0
a similar experiment took place last year over the @entity128 ( pictured )			0
after releasing the rocket in space , researchers then visually observed the subsequent movement of the vapour as it traces the motions of background environment the rocket blasted off from @entity7 in @entity8 at 5:26 am local time ( 12.26 gmt ) when high frequency radio waves , such as those used for the @entity140 ( gps ) travel through a disturbed layer of @entity47 's electrically charged atmosphere , the ionosphere , they can be disrupted			1

clouds seen in @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25
@entity147 blasted off from @entity7 this *morning*
@entity147 's release of vapour was intended to help study ionosphere
this is a crucial layer of charged particles surrounding our planet
launch could *explain* how *ionsphere* affects technology such as @entity140
