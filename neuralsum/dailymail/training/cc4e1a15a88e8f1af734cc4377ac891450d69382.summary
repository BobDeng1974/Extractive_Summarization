the gap in the market is proving a huge winner for consumers and now more men can pay to turn their troubled sex life around for just $ 3			0
@entity15 's patent for the drug viagra ran out in june and now its cost has plummeted the cheaper varieties are being stocked in chemists throughout the country - and according to the @entity33 - @entity32 , blooms and @entity35 are passing on the reduced cost for $ 14 for four 100mg pills of the drug			1
