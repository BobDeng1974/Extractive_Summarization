the public release of a video showing football star @entity2 punching his now - wife in an @entity5 elevator may have led to the termination of his contract with the @entity9 and an indefinite suspension from the @entity11 , but the disgraced athlete still has plenty of fans			1
and shockingly , a good number of those fans still supporting @entity2 are female			1
' there 's two sides to every story , ' said @entity20 , a 23 - year - old waitress from @entity39 who was wearing a black , rhinestone - decorated jersey with the white no. 27			2
' i saw the video			2
that 's their personal business , and it should n't have affected his career			0
i do n't agree with domestic violence , but she 's still with him , so obviously it was n't that big of a deal			0
everyone should just drop it			0
' the team , meanwhile , has started a @entity67 policy , allowing fans to trade in their @entity2 jersey for another player on the @entity9			1
they will also no longer be selling @entity2 jerseys			1
return policy : fans can exchange their @entity2 jerseys for any other player the team has announced , though it does not appear @entity79 ( above ) will be doing that not everyone is a fan : one woman started screaming at someone wearing the @entity2 jersey , ' you support a wife beater ! ' player no more : @entity2 had his contract with the @entity9 terminated , and has been suspended from the @entity11 it seems , however , that more than a few fans will be wearing their rice jersey until it is in tatters			1
' i took the bus here , so people were , like , " good , i 'm glad to see to someone out here showing support , " ' said @entity97 , 18 , of wearing his @entity2 jersey			2
' but i 've also seen a lot of people giving me dirty looks and people saying stuff to me like , " i ca n't believe you 'd wear that			0
do n't you know what he did ? " ' the teenager added , ' yeah , i 'm pretty aware of what he did			0
and , yes , it was awful and it was definitely a mistake on his part , but he deserves a second chance			0
... people have done so much worse in this league			0
' not a fan : one person taped over his @entity2 jersey , writing @entity121 over his name stand by your man : rice fans filled the stands at least one fan was not fond of the jerseys though , screaming at one person wearing the white no. 27 , ' you support a wife - beater ! '			1

the @entity9 played the @entity32 this evening , their first game since the video of @entity2 punching his now - wife went public
many fans , *including* females , *proudly* wore their @entity2 jerseys , even though the team terminated his contract
the team is allowing fans to exchange his jersey for any other player
