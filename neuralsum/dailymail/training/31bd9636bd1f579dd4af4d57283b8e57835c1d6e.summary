two - year - old @entity4 was left lying across two plastic chairs at @entity8 for six hours because there were no free beds @entity4 's furious parents claim that medical staff refused to let him use a spare camp - bed because it had no sides - and they feared he may roll off in desperation , they suggested using one of the camp beds which the hospital keeps for parents to sleep on – only to be told it was against health and safety rules			1

mr @entity4 , 34 , said : ‘ it was awful			2
@entity4 ’s temperature was sky high			2
all he wanted to do was sleep but he could n’t because the chairs were so uncomfortable			0
i could tell that he was in pain			0
he was writhing around , and the chairs were so sticky and hot			0
it ’s horrible to see your child like that			0
i felt so sorry for him			0
’ @entity4 , from @entity8 , first fell ill more than a week ago , when he had a high temperature and sleeping problems , and lost his appetite			2
the toddler 's mother @entity11 said she was told by nurses to sit on the blue chairs until a proper bed became available			1
she became so frustrated after making repeated requests for a bed that she ended up creating a makeshift one herself with the two chairs @entity4 's father @entity10 , said : ' to be left lying across two plastic chairs in this day and age is unacceptable			1
the poor lad was so hot he was sticking to the plastic and found it incredibly uncomfortable			0
he was restless and unable to sleep ' after six hours of waiting on the chairs , @entity4 was finally given a bed at 10.30pm and was discharged the next afternoon			1
he has been given antibiotics and is making a good recovery hospital doctors tested @entity4 on monday of last week and wrongly diagnosed him with a viral infection , sending him home with instructions to give him painkillers			1
@entity4 ’s condition worsened and at lunchtime on friday he was taken to hospital with a temperature of @entity93 ( @entity94 )			2
tests showed such dangerously high levels of bacteria in his blood that doctors prescribed the highest dose of antibiotics available , administered via a drip			2
the two - year - old was given a bed in the emergency department but when he was wheeled to a children ’s assessment ward at 4.30pm he was made to sit in a chair and wait			1

even the consultant who came in to talk to us did not question the situation			0
there was no blanket offered , nothing			0
@entity4 was swept to the side as if he was just another number			1
’ her husband added : ‘ my wife … got so frustrated in the end that she pushed two chairs together and laid him down			0
blood infections can be fatal if they are not treated			0
’ last year it emerged that 40 per cent of people waited for more than four hours to be seen at the @entity8 ( @entity8 is pictured ) when mr @entity4 , a security officer , arrived at 9.30pm he suggested to staff that they use one of the hospital camp beds for @entity4			1
but , incredibly , they said that would be dangerous and against hospital policy as the bed had no sides and the boy might roll out			0
@entity4 was eventually given a bed at 10.30pm and was sent home the following afternoon			1
he is continuing on his course of antibiotics and is expected to make a full recovery			0
but his parents , who have six other children , have made an official complaint to the hospital			2
mr @entity4 said : ‘ the care we received at the hospital was absolutely appalling			2
to be left lying across two plastic chairs in this day and age is unacceptable			1
‘ and to say that lying on a camp bed would be against health and safety is ridiculous – surely it ’s more safe than a chair			1
’ he added : ‘ we want to make sure that other people do n’t suffer in the same way			0
it should be about putting patients first			0
’ @entity8 was criticised 18 months ago by the @entity163 for a lack of staff and resources			0
a hospital spokesman said yesterday : ‘ while we are sorry to hear @entity37 and mrs @entity38 are unhappy with the care their son received , these issues had not previously been raised with us and we are not familiar with the accounts presented through the media			0
’ he added that the hospital would be happy to ‘ discuss any aspect of @entity4 ’s treatment with his parents ’ and ‘ investigate any remaining concerns ’ .			1

@entity4 , 2 , was *battling* a blood infection and hooked up to a drip
but there were no beds so was left sitting on chair at side of the ward
parents claim medical staff refused him a camp bed in case he rolled off
in desperation , his mother made him a makeshift bed from two chairs
eventually got a bed six hours later and was discharged next day
