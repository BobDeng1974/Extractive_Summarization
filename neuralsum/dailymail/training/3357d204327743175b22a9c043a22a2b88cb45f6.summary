the world could run out of computer space by 2020 , a leading data storage company has warned			1
@entity3 said we are facing a data capacity deficit of more than six zettabytes - nearly twice the data produced in 2013			1
@entity8 , the company ’s vice president for branded products , said that there was ‘ stratospheric demand ’ for computers and that the industry has simply not kept up			2
@entity3 said we are facing a data capacity deficit of more than six zettabytes - nearly twice the data produced in 2013			1
the warning serves as a reminder for users to clean out their hard drives ( stock image ) the warning serves as a reminder for users to clean out their hard drives and make the most of the space they have on their machines , rather than just buy more space			1
in an interview with @entity30 , mr @entity8 said : ‘ @entity31 has never been more important			0
' as valuable as oil and just as difficult to mine , model and manage , data is swiftly becoming a vital asset to businesses the world over ’			0
mr @entity8 called the looming crisis a ‘ data capacity gap ’ and said that last year the total amount of digital data produced around the world was 3.5 zettabytes			1
by 2020 , that will increase to 44 zettabytes of data annually , which is six zettabytes more than will be produced at the time			1
mr @entity8 called the looming crisis a ‘ data capacity gap ’ , which , by 2020 , will be which is six zettabytes more than will be produced at the time - the equivalent of 206,158,430,208 smartphones , assuming a typical device has @entity52 of storage ( the @entity51 6 is pictured ) to put that into context , a single zettabyte is the equivalent of 34,359,738,368 smartphones , assuming a typical device has @entity52 of storage			1
mr @entity8 said : ‘ while the ability to squeeze ever more dense data onto the same amount of space is a real testament to human ingenuity and engineering , it 's starting to reach the point where new technologies will have to take over			0
’ mr @entity8 blamed the hard drive industry for not developing new products , which could lead to consumers being frustrated ( stock image ) in the interview , he blamed the hard drive industry for not doing enough research into new products			2
mr @entity8 said @entity3 was looking into heat - assisted magnetic recording ( @entity81 ) as one experimental technology to increase space			1
this technology uses lasers to heat the storage device and magnetically record data onto it			1
@entity89 reported that this could lead to 50 terabits of storage per square inch , compared to the few hundred gigabits now the report said : ‘ to put this in perspective , a digital library of all books written in the world would be approximately 400 terabytes - meaning that in the very near future conceivably all such books could be stored on as few as 20 hamr drives			1
’ computers have followed @entity103 ’s law since the 1970s - early computers had just five megabytes of capacity - which states their capacity will double every two years			2
the law was proposed by @entity109 founder @entity103 in a paper in 1965 , but has a natural limit due to the materials used to make circuits			0
only so many chips can be put together on a piece of silicon before they stop working properly , unless new materials are found - graphene has been suggested as one option			0
a typical external hard drive currently has a five terabytes of space			0
it costs around £ 200 ( $ 312 ) and can store 2.5 million songs , 1,000 films and two million photos			0
for people who work with highly sensitive documents and official secrets - or are extremely paranoid about protecting their personal data - there is now a range of self - destructing hard drives			1
reminiscent of the gadgets in @entity136 , the drives can be wiped instantly simply by sending a text message - but they come with a spy price tag of £ 1,000 ( $ 1,600 )			2
there are three self - destructing drives available from @entity142 - based @entity141 , as well as a master @entity143			2
prices start at £ 938 ( $ 1,500 ) , for the @entity146 , while the @entity147 costs £ 967 ( $ 1,560 ) and the top - of - the - range @entity148 costs £ 1,027 ( $ 1,663 )			0
the @entity147 and @entity148 ( pictured centre and right ) are 2.5 - inch solid state drives , that are controlled using a free smartphone app. when a user loses the drive , they send a text to the device and the storage is destroyed automatically			1
an authentication token ( left ) adds an extra level of security the @entity147 is a 2.5 - inch solid state drive ( @entity163 ) , that is controlled using a free smartphone app available on @entity165 and @entity166			2
more than one smartphone can be linked to a drive , and if the phone is lost or stolen , the connection can be broken using a pin code			0
the drive has @entity173 of encrypted storage and can be fitted to computers , or connected externally using a usb port			0
it also has built - in @entity178 , or cellular technology , which means it can receive text messages			0
when a user loses the drive , or wants to permanently delete the data on it , they send a text to the device and the storage is destroyed automatically			0
the technology is designed to fragment , or scramble , the data , making it impossible to extract or read , plus a built - in security measure stops any attempts made to recover the data			2
in addition to a text message , the data can be destroyed by turning off the gsm signal , entering a pin too many times incorrectly , removing the drive from a pc , when the battery falls below a certain level , or using an optional authentication token .			0

experts claim we are facing a data capacity deficit of more than six zettabytes - nearly twice all the data produced in 2013
@entity3 said industry has not kept up with demand for data storage
the warning serves as a reminder for users to clean out their hard drives
heat - assisted magnetic recording could be used to store data in the future
technology could lead to 50 terabits of storage per square inch
