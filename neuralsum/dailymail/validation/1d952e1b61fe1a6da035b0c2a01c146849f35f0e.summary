despite flying through the air at high - speeds , researchers have discovered that bats avoid mishaps because they have their own set of ‘ traffic rules ' when hunting for food			2
@entity9 ’s bats , in particular , chase each other , perform tandem turns and can even slow down without ever hitting each other			1
and now researchers have found this is down to the way they take part in ' formation flying '			2
researchers from @entity18 measured biosonar bat calls to calculate what members of group perceived as they foraged for food			1
it found the bats interact by swapping between leading and following , and they swap these roles by copying the route a nearby individual was using up to 500 milliseconds earlier dr @entity30 , of the @entity31 at @entity18 , studied pairs of @entity34 ’s bats foraging low over water for stranded insects at a site near the village of @entity39 , in @entity9			1
these flying mammals perceive their surroundings by emitting loud and high - pitched biosonar calls and listening for the returning echoes			1
because bat biosonar imaging is much sparser in information than vision , dr @entity30 was able to accurately measure the biosonar calls of the interacting bats and then calculate what each of the individuals perceived			1
the researchers found that the winged mammal uses one simple trick to create their interactive behaviours - they swap who is taking a leading role and who is following			2
they swap these leader - follower roles and perform chases or co-ordinated manoeuvres by copying the route a nearby individual was using up to 500 milliseconds earlier			1
the experts studied @entity34 's bats ( pictured )			1
they said : ' the bats seem to have adopted a simple trick - once another individual is close enough for your biosonar to pick up its echo [ and ] copy this individual ’s flight direction			1
the discovery could help improve search and rescue missions and surveillance operations this almost as fast as the blink of a human eye , which as been measured at between 300 to 400 milliseconds			2
dr @entity30 said : ' the bats seem to have adopted a simple trick - once another individual is close enough for your biosonar to pick up its echo , copy this individual ’s flight direction within four to five of your own wingbeats			1
' and his team said the discovery could have wider implications - helping improve search and rescue missions and surveillance operations			0

the robotic wings are made using carbon fibre and , similar to the wing of a bird , each have a wrist joint custom built using a 3d printer inspired by the way bats and birds avoid colliding in mid-air , roboticists have created flying drones with ' morphing wings '			0
the robotic wings are made using carbon fibre and , similar to the wing of a bird , each have a wrist joint custom built using a 3d printer			0
these joints are hinged in such a way so that as the rest of the wing flaps , the hand can freely fold and unfold over the arm , much like origami folding , without any actuation			0
in particular the pin joint connects the arm wing and the hand wing			0
the arm wing attaches to the body of the robot at the shoulder joint , which initiates the flapping			0
and the complete wing set has a wingspan of 15.7 inches ( 40cm ) with a length , or chord , of three inches ( 80 mm )			0
in addition to morphing shape to avoid collisions , the mechanism could also allow future flying robots to easily squeeze between obstacles , such as branches of a tree , and fully recover after accidental hard impacts			0
the morphing technology was built by experts from @entity140 .			0
