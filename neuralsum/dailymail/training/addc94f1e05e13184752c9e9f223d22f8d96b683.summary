by @entity0 published : 12:43 est , 10 february 2013 updated : 13:14 est , 10 february 2013 initially set 25 years after the events of @entity2 : @entity3 follows the story of @entity6 's ancestors , and is being released exclusively for the @entity7			1
@entity8 , a knight of the @entity9 , sets out to avenge the death of his mother , at the hands of his own father , who has now returned from years of exile to take up residence in a mysterious castle			2
@entity6 is now a powerful vampire called @entity6 after being corrupted by an ancient evil called @entity19			0
he 's declared war upon the @entity9 , setting the scene for a showdown between father and son			1
brother in arms : concept art showing how @entity8 will look in the final game we caught up with @entity30 , producer of the @entity32 saga , and quizzed him about what fans can expect in @entity35			1
tell us about the game			0
how is the story told ? @entity30 : ' the plot centres around the blood feud with the @entity40 's but this time from @entity6 's perspective			1
the story is told backwards like @entity43 's @entity42 and it 's not until the very end of the game that everything becomes clear			1
' we wanted to show that the fate of each character and the choices they make have a direct impact on those closest to them			0
i think once all is said and done players will have some sympathy with our villain			0
the original was a beautiful - looking game , although there were frequent gripes with drops in framerate			0
what improvements can we expect to see in this version ? @entity30 : ' this game is very much a combination of the old and the @entity69 has the modern sensibility of he first game but harks back to the classics in a more cohesive way			0
' we want to screw around with player perception , on the surface this looks like a classic side scrolling @entity80 game but look deeper and you will see a very combat focused game that utilises the stereoscopic 3d effects to the max. ' often we put the camera into the game world and in several places the game is shown as a third person perspective			1
it 's this constant melding of old and new that will surprise players			1
does gameplay stay true to the very first games , or does it follow in @entity32 's footsteps ? @entity30 : ' this is very much a sequel to @entity2 : @entity32 and in that respect gameplay is consistent with that game			1
' it 's much more about combat which is deep and intense like the original			1
of course , we have incorporated some of the features of the classics and exploration plays a much big role this time			2
' in some ways we see this as a spiritual successor to @entity2 : @entity6 's curse with its multiple characters and branching pathways			2
are there any plans to bring @entity32 to the @entity116 ? @entity30 : ' this game is only planned for @entity7 and we have no plans to bring to @entity116 ' 5			1
how long will the game last ? @entity30 : ' average playthroughs are around 16 hours but you wo n't have collected or seen everything the game has to offer			0
usually this would take around 20 hours			0
what inspired you when designing the levels / beasts ? @entity30 : ' it 's really the classic games from the @entity133 and @entity134 era in particular the original @entity80 and @entity2			2
we often check those designs when redesigning our world			0
' we all grew up on those early classics and it 's those games that have inspired us in redefining the @entity80 universe			2
' see the latest trailer here : follow us on @entity144 : @ @entity145 and on @entity146 : @entity147 .			0
