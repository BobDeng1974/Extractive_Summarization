by @entity0 if you treated yourself to a lie - in this morning , pat yourself on the back			0
for not only will sleeping in at the weekend help you feel more relaxed , it also makes you slimmer			0
researchers have discovered that extra sleep is the key to beating hunger pangs and staving off cravings for fatty food			1
stay sleeping a little longer : a study in @entity11 found an extra 90 minutes in bed could suppress appetite even just 90 minutes extra in bed makes a difference			2
a study of overweight young adults found that those who went to bed earlier or stayed in bed for longer experienced a 14 per cent drop in their appetite and a 62 per cent decline in their desire for unhealthy salty or sweet snacks			1
the findings suggest simple changes to bedtimes could help to combat the @entity31 ’s obesity epidemic			0
previous studies have shown that too little sleep can lead to weight problems , partly because it disrupts the hormone balance which helps to keep appetite in check			2
but scientists from the @entity39 wanted to see if a simple adjustment to sleeping patterns could bring about rapid changes in food cravings and eating habits			1
they studied ten overweight or obese men and women aged between 21 and 40 who slept an average of six and a half hours or less a night			0
for the first week , they were told to carry on with their normal sleeping patterns , during which time they were quizzed on how hungry they felt and what foods they yearned for			0
crucial : scientists say the key to suppressing appetite is @entity59 ( @entity60 ) in the second week , they were told to extend their time in bed to between eight and eight and a half hours			1
each one was given a wrist monitor to record when they got out of bed and kept a daily log of their sleeping patterns			0
the results , published in the journal @entity74 , showed that by increasing their time in bed by just 90 minutes , the overweight volunteers drastically reduced their appetite – in particular their desire to scoff unhealthy snacks			1
professor @entity81 , former head of sleep research at @entity83 in @entity84 , said more time in bed appears to curb appetite by directly affecting the brain , not just by preventing people from eating			1
he said the secret is the amount of @entity59 , or @entity60 , which is when the brain switches into dream mode			0
‘ if you sleep longer you have more @entity59 and that has appetite suppressant properties , ’ he added .			2

researchers from @entity39 studied 10 overweight people
those who spent longer in bed reduced snack cravings by 62 per cent
scientists say key is rapid eye movement sleep which suppresses appetite
