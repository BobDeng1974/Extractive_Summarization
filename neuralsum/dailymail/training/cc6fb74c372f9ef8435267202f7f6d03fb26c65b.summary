when @entity1 answered a question about the new £ 5billion television contract on wednesday evening , spontaneous applause broke out in the room from a group of @entity7 fans listening in			1
‘ when i was living in @entity8 and @entity9 i was paying about £ 200 a month to have the @entity10 at my house , ’ he said			2
‘ i think the @entity10 is better when i am here			2
’ he really believes that stuff and so do his legions of supporters			0
@entity1 and his @entity7 backroom team celebrate the late winner against @entity17 on wednesday @entity1 embraces @entity18 after @entity7 's @entity10 victory at @entity20 @entity1 speaks to the media at the post-match press conference on wednesday night @entity25 's team of reporters discuss whether @entity1 's off - the - field antics are starting to harm his and the @entity10 's reputations			1
with that razor - sharp quip he walked out , heading back towards the manager ’s office at @entity20 to discuss with members of his backroom team the mayhem that occurred on the pitch in the 88th minute			0
on thursday night , when the @entity38 announced that @entity18 had escaped punishment for throttling @entity17 substitute @entity40 and then laying his forehead on him , it was regarded by the club as a major victory			1
they ignored the rationale , the television pictures that clearly showed referee @entity45 on the scene when @entity18 grabbed @entity40 round the neck after @entity48 had nobbled @entity51			1
the tv images showing @entity18 ’s head make contact with @entity40 ’s left ear were inconclusive , according to a panel of three former referees			2
because of that , @entity18 has got off scot - free			0
this literally is a fight for the title , with @entity7 happy to antagonise the @entity38 , the opposition , officials , tv companies and the rest of the media with this increasingly odd behaviour			2
@entity1 has everybody on the run and on thursday it was the turn of the @entity38 to produce a series of statistics in an attempt to disprove his theory that a campaign has been started to destabilise @entity7			1
since 2005 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 have been charged six times by the @entity38 for incidents that were not seen by the match official			2
@entity80 , @entity81 and @entity7 have been charged four times			0
the idea that there is a vendetta is a myth			0
@entity18 ( centre left ) grabs @entity17 midfielder @entity40 in a headlock as tempers fray @entity18 ( third right ) appears to aim a headbutt in the direction of @entity40 on wednesday @entity18 also clashes with @entity17 's @entity93 in the closing stages of the @entity10 match @entity96 ( right ) celebrates wildly after the final whistle is blown at @entity20 @entity1 ( left ) and assistant coach @entity98 get animated against @entity17 on wednesday night still , given @entity1 ’s consistent claims about the injustices in the game , it would certainly help if the @entity38 publicly clarified the position surrounding off - the - ball incidents			1
when he was questioned about @entity107 ’s off - the - ball kick in the back of @entity109 at @entity110 on @entity111 , @entity1 responded with a query about @entity114 ’s escape for raising his hands to @entity117 defender @entity116			0
on tuesday , @entity1 highlighted the @entity38 ’s failure to take any action against an unnamed player ( @entity120 ) for the glance at @entity122 before the @entity80 man elbowed him at @entity124 on sunday			2
from time to time , the @entity7 manager tosses in @entity127 ’s shove on him at @entity20 on october 5 , for which the @entity74 manager went unpunished			2
the memory plays tricks sometimes and @entity1 ’s acolytes have forgotten how miserable life was in the weeks and months before he was sacked by @entity133 in 2007 after drawing 1 - 1 with @entity134			0
we are close to revisiting that era , returning to a period when @entity139 football had earned a rest from the @entity7 manager			1
@entity1 ( right ) and @entity74 manager @entity127 during a match at @entity20 last october @entity1 ( left ) celebrates wildly after @entity7 beat @entity75 at the @entity142 last year seven years on they brought him back and just over a year into his five - year deal , nothing has changed			1
it is a sad day when the normally mild - mannered @entity7 assistant manager @entity98 is seen haranguing the fourth official , as he did repeatedly on wednesday			0
with coaching assistant @entity149 , who fell to his knees and then grasped colleague @entity151 in a bearhug after @entity51 ’s dramatic 89th - minute winner , it is to be expected			0
now @entity98 is at it as well			0
in recent weeks , @entity7 ’s technical area has become like the @entity156 at chucking out time			1
someone needs to call time on it			0
what happened to winning with dignity or showing a bit of class ? what a shame because @entity7 have a brilliant team , seven points clear of @entity75 in the @entity10 and hurtling towards the title			1
at this rate it is in danger of being tainted			0
@entity51 ( centre ) celebrates with his team - mates after scoring a late winner for @entity7 against @entity17 @entity1 argues with a @entity175 ball boy during his side 's 1 - 0 defeat at @entity178 last season @entity1 keeps the ball away from @entity181 during @entity7 's 2 - 0 win over @entity183 last season why should @entity139 football accept this yobbish , boorish behaviour on the touchline from one of the world ’s super coaches and his increasingly aggressive assistants ? with the exception of @entity133 , there is no one on the @entity7 staff who is prepared to tell @entity1 to fall into line			1
there is no question who runs the show there			0
not only that , he is being allowed to run rings around @entity139 football .			1

the @entity38 announced on thursday that @entity18 escaped punishment after grabbing @entity40 around the neck
@entity7 regard the *announcement* as a major victory
the club 's technical area has become like the @entity156 at closing time
@entity1 is being allowed to run rings around @entity139 football
@entity7 are seven points clear of @entity75 in the @entity10
