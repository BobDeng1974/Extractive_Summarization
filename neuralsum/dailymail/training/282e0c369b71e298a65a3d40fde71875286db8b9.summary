by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 for @entity3 this is a swansong			1
after this @entity5 , he will retire from international football			1
‘ i ’ll be hanging up my heart , ’ he said , when he unveiled this plan			2
it is a final chance to savour his effortless poise on this stage			2
for @entity13 , it is perhaps the last time they will be forced to dance to his tune			1
@entity3 was 35 in may ; a year older than @entity17 , a year younger than @entity18			1
he has signed a two - year deal at @entity20 , where he has added three @entity22 titles in as many years to two won in a decade at @entity23			1
video : scroll down to see @entity25 star @entity3 doing tricks in training ahead of @entity13 clash last hurrah : @entity3 will quit international football after the @entity5 talking tactics : @entity3 chats with @entity31 and @entity25 's head coach @entity32 the deal was confirmed on wednesday and those who watched him in @entity36 last season will tell you the maestro just gets better with age			1
he breezed into @entity41 , @entity25 ’s @entity5 nerve centre , on wednesday like @entity43 dressed by @entity44 , albeit somewhat more carefully groomed			1
heavily bearded with a flowing mane , he was tanned and weathered , with trinkets and jewels tied to his right wrist and a footballer ’s watch perched on his left			2
unhurried and utterly at ease , as in possession of the football , he shrugged and tugged at his beard , refused to deny @entity56 had tried to lure him to @entity57 and promised he would do his utmost to summon a performance like the one against @entity13 in @entity60			1
‘ this is one of my targets , to play like i played in @entity63 , ’ he smiled			1
danger man : @entity3 was a thorn in @entity13 's side at @entity60 ‘ to control the game and help my team win			1
’ even at 35 ? even in the suffocating humidity predicted for @entity70 ? even on a pitch that looks like a terrible quilted blanket ? ‘ the temperature will be a problem for everyone			2
we have been preparing in @entity25 , before we came to @entity77			1
the pitch will be a problem for everyone			2
it is important to make the ball roll			2
‘ @entity13 is a great team who is much better now			1
they have young players , who run a lot , very physical , but we know how to face them			2
@entity25 always does well against @entity13			1
’ since winning the @entity5 in 2006 , @entity3 has become one of the team ’s spiritual leaders as well as being recognised as one of his generation ’s finest playmakers			1
practice makes perfect : @entity3 has modelled his free - kick technique on @entity95 @entity94 at the @entity97 training camp on wednesday he was met by @entity94 , the @entity95 free - kick expert who played for eight years at @entity98			1
@entity3 studied his dead - ball technique until he had unlocked the secret and presented @entity94 with a no 21 @entity25 shirt signed ‘ with respect and gratitude ’			1
in return he took possession of two no 8 shirts , @entity94 ’s number , in the colours of @entity77 and @entity109			1
@entity25 manager @entity32 has compared @entity3 ’s calm authority to that of @entity112 , an @entity25 and @entity20 legend who was killed in a car crash in 1989			1
@entity32 ’s predecessor @entity114 called @entity3 his ‘ silent leader ’			2
yet the midfielder is not expected to be allowed to perform in his preferred position , sitting on the toes of the centre halves			2
@entity25 are too concerned with their defensive frailties and @entity32 will ask @entity122 to protect the back four			2
limbering up : @entity31 , @entity3 and @entity122 prepare to face @entity13 @entity3 and @entity124 , the 21 - year - old heir apparent to @entity3 ’s crown , will sit either side of @entity122 , with @entity127 and @entity128 ahead of them in a five - man midfield			1
they trained this way on wednesday , with @entity31 the lone striker , with only one goal since march and at the centre of a ‘ should he start ’ debate in the @entity97 media , similar to the one that has swirled around @entity140			0
‘ we are trying new solutions , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ we like to have one in front of the defence and two closer to the opposing goal free to invent			0
the most important thing is not the position but your interpretation of the position			0
’ when the @entity152 reporters pursued details of his new role , he flashed his teeth again			0
‘ i am not going to make it easy for you , ’ he said			0
‘ we have 23 players , all good choices			0
@entity25 do not depend only on me			0
if every player can shine for 10 minutes it will be enough			0
’ all smiles : @entity3 jokes around with @entity31 in training on wednesday @entity97 newspaper @entity163 wrote of ‘ @entity13 ’s obsession ’ with @entity3 , since that date in @entity63 , when they danced to his tune			1
‘ the important thing is to play as a group , as we did in 1982 and 2006 , ’ he said			0
‘ we are here to win , of course			0
we always play to win			0
i am never happy just to pass the group stage			0
we want to go to the end			0
’ twenty years after @entity178 coach @entity177 threw him into the @entity180 team at the age of 15 and offended the rest of the squad by ordering them to ‘ give the ball to @entity3 , he knows how to look after it ’ , he will bow out of international football			1
he will find it hard			0
in his book , he wrote emotionally about playing for his country and how he stood over his penalty during the 2006 world cup final at one with every @entity97			0
chasing shadows : @entity13 players could n't get near @entity193 in @entity63 ‘ being part of a team that belongs to everyone makes me feel good and at peace with myself , ’ he wrote in i think therefore i play			1
a lot of the time , it ’s better than sex : it lasts longer and if it all falls flat , it ca n’t just be your fault			0
‘ take someone like @entity208			0
he says he ’s slept with 700 women in his time but he does n’t get picked for @entity25 any more			0
deep down , can he really be happy ? i certainly would n’t be			0
it makes you better , takes you to a higher level			0
much better to be a soldier on the pitch than in the bedroom			0
’ when asked again if international retirement is still his intention , he replied : ‘ yes			2
i am going to give space to the youngsters but if they need me i will be at their disposal , and if i come i will want to play			0
otherwise i will be nervous			0
