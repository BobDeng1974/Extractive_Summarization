for three long years @entity0 put her regular , excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high - flying career in sports marketing			1
long hours spent at her computer , plus business trips abroad were surely responsible for triggering the searing headaches that made it feel as though her head was being gripped in a vice			2
‘ i was 30 when the migraines began , randomly at first , but then they came every month , ’ says @entity0 , 35 , who lives in @entity12 , @entity13 , with her husband @entity14 , 42 , a fitness centre owner			1
‘ i blamed my career and lifestyle			2
at work , i ’d have to sit in a dark room and shut my eyes as the pain was all - consuming			1
sometimes , the migraines would wipe me out for a week			2
@entity0 ( pictured ) used to put her regular , excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high - flying career in sports marketing ‘ despite being a virtual workaholic , there were times i was unable to function and would have to phone in sick , which left me feeling terribly guilty			1
’ things got so bad that last year @entity0 gave up her job to work part - time for her husband , helping to market his firm			1
but then @entity0 had an epiphany when she began keeping a diary of her headaches — her migraines were linked to her menstrual cycle			1
‘ i noticed they always came the day before my period , and it was a relief to finally realise what the trigger was			0
‘ it altered the way i tried to deal with them			0
i took advice , mapped out my cycles , and upped my dosage of magnesium ( said to regulate hormones ) and took over-the - counter drug @entity51 to try to prevent a migraine coming on 24 hours before i knew my period was due			2
this has staved off a full - blown migraine for the last few months			2
’ @entity0 is not the only woman suffering from this commonly misdiagnosed side - effect of the menstrual cycle			1
@entity0 ( pictured after a migraine ) gave up her job to work part - time for her husband last year when the migraines got really bad according to charity the @entity63 , a staggering 50 per cent of women suffer menstrual migraines immediately before , during or just after their period			1
but , like @entity0 , very many do n’t make the connection between the two for years — and neither do their gps			1
online forums are awash with women discussing the ‘ lightbulb moment ’ they finally realised their cycle was to blame			1
although migraines are an age - old problem , the diagnosis of specific menstrual migraines is a modern phenomenon , following extensive research over the past 25 years			1
professor @entity80 , a leading specialist in headaches and women ’s health , says : ‘ the most common cause is a drop in oestrogen towards the end of the cycle			1
this hormone is released at the start of it , and levels rise , eventually triggering ovulation and an egg ’s release			0
@entity0 ( pictured ) has seen various gps and doctors about her severe migraines but none have been able to come up with a treatment that has worked completely ‘ progesterone is released and prepares the womb lining for a fertilised egg			1
if pregnancy does n’t occur , both levels drop and cause a period			0
‘ it ’s this sudden drop that triggers a migraine as the body deals with the hormone withdrawal			0
’ she says hormones used in contraceptives , such as the @entity113 , coil and patch put all women of menstruating age at risk — but those in their 30s and 40s more so			2
‘ this is because hormone levels fluctuate more in the years building up to the menopause , mean ing the drop in oestrogen and therefore withdrawal symptoms are greater , ’ she reveals			0
‘ traditional headache remedies do n’t work			2
this is why we ’d like to see greater diagnosis , so women can get the right treatment			0
’ @entity0 ’s work was not the only thing that suffered			1
she often found herself saying to @entity14 : ‘ not tonight , darling , i ’ve a headache ’ — and meaning it			0
‘ thank goodness he ’s very understanding , ’ she says			0
her social life was often wrecked , too : ‘ i ’ve had to regularly cancel social engagements , including a close friend ’s baby shower			0
’ @entity0 saw various doctors : her gp , another for a second opinion , plus a consultant — but none came up with a treatment that worked completely			1
‘ all they suggested was that i take @entity51 , but until i started taking it as a preventative measure it did nothing to help me			0
’ dr @entity154 , at the @entity63 , advises patients who suspect their headaches may be menstruation - related to start keeping a diary like @entity0			1
‘ i think women have always suspected they have menstrual migraines but doctors have not always believed them until now			1
‘ now , however , there is a growing awareness of the condition , which means more women are finally being diagnosed			0
’ @entity165 47 , a dental company sales consultant living in @entity166 , @entity167 , has had migraines for more than a decade , but only found out two years ago they were linked to her menstrual cycle , thanks to the migraine diary she was keeping			1
@entity165 , 47 , ( pictured ) has also suffered from severe migraines for more than ten years but only discovered two years ago that they are related to her periods she reveals : ‘ the first migraine i suffered was in my late 30s , and even going from bed to bathroom caused agonising pain in my head			1
there were times i wondered whether the headaches were a symptom of something horribly sinister , such as a brain tumour			2
’ only when the migraines became a monthly occurrence , at age 44 , did @entity165 made the connection			1
she now has a supply of the migraine drug @entity191 on hand to take on her ‘ danger ’ days to prevent attacks			0
‘ it was such a relief to finally find something that worked for me			0
but if i do n’t take a tablet in time , the ensuing migraine is hell			2
’ even with the medication , she still plans her social life and work meetings around her periods			2
‘ i deliberately do n’t book anything for the week of my period , as on so many occasions i ’ve had to bolt when a migraine has started			0
@entity165 ( seen here age 27 ) uses medication to combat the headaches but still has to plan her social life and meetings around her periods ‘ @entity210 i had to abandon dinner with my partner and go to bed at 10pm , when one came on			1
‘ unlike most women , i ’m actually longing for the menopause in the hope that once my periods stop , so too will the migraines			2
’ for @entity223 , 31 , a special educational needs support assistant who lives in @entity225 , @entity226 , with partner @entity227 , 33 , a sales manager , and their son @entity229 , two , the severity of monthly menstrual migraines was so great last @entity231 that her gp sent her to @entity233 fearing she had a bleed on the brain			1
‘ i spent five days in hospital on morphine			0
a ct scan ruled out anything sinister , but i had felt as though my head would literally explode			0
it was so frightening , all i could think was my lovely little boy needs his mummy and what if something serious was happening to me ? ’ @entity165 ( pictured ) suffered her first migraine in her late 30s , but they became a monthly occurrence when she reached 44 , at which point @entity165 connected the pain to her menstrual cycle however , unlike many other women , @entity223 has suffered from menstrual migraines for all of the years of her adult life			1
‘ i first had the headaches at school but blamed exam stress for them			1
they worsened at university and my gp sent me to a neurologist			0
‘ he diagnosed migraines , but did n’t link them to my cycle			2
‘ it was n’t until i was talking to my great aunt , now in her 80s five years ago , that i realised the cause			0
she said she used to suffer terrible migraines during her period and suspected this was my problem , too			0
‘ after that , i used the @entity273 mobile phone app to record my symptoms and periods and , sure enough , a pattern soon emerged			0
‘ subsequently i also tried homeopathy , specifically a herbal remedy called sepia , which is supposed to help problems associated with your period problems			0
’ @entity223 is an extreme case			0
but , for many women , the stark facts are that a migraine is another monthly misery they have to endure .			0
