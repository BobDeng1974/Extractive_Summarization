but with the fame and fortune of billionaire @entity9 are numerous stories of tantrums , violence and pay - offs - all of which he denies			1

security aficionado @entity41 told the @entity36 : ' the guy was dying to get in there			0
so he actually handed me a blank check for a million dollars for the owner to give to a charity of his choice			0
i told [ club founder @entity50 ] , " do n’t let this douchebag in			0
" ' @entity41 added : ' i 've known him for 20 years			0
' but @entity9 tells a different story , saying that ' he came to me eight months later and wanted the check back			1
i said , " forget it			0
" ' another incident stemmed from a dispute between @entity9 and professional gambler @entity58			1
allegations : professional gambler @entity58 and his wife @entity61 , have accused @entity9 of trying to force his way into her hotel room @entity58 told the @entity36 that he was flying to @entity64 recently with his wife @entity61 and @entity9 , and @entity9 promised to look after his wife after he was unexpectedly called away to @entity67			1
@entity68 claimed that @entity9 grew angry with her after she refused to meet him and friends for dinner at the @entity73 in @entity64			1
she said that @entity9 tried to force his way into her room at the hotel , and would not leave when she asked him to			1
but @entity9 again denied any wrongdoing , telling the @entity36 : ' i tried to help the guy			1
i wish i ’d never met him			0
' last week , it was reported that @entity9 pulled a gun on an elevator operator at @entity84 's @entity83 after an altercation with the man			1
when police arrived , @entity9 was found to have a gun , which was confiscated by officers			2
he claimed it was n't loaded			0
earlier this month , @entity9 was banned from top @entity84 restaurant @entity92 after the staff said that he allegedly threatened to kill the manager when he did n't get his favorite table			1
@entity9 reportedly sent a email of complaint to @entity92 owner @entity98			1
@entity9 admits having a disagreement with a female manager but denied threatening to kill her after she ignored his phone call , according to the @entity36			1
the paper reports that after the face - to - face confrontation with the manager , he sent a caps - locked tirade to @entity98 and cc'ed a group of his famous friends including @entity23 , @entity109 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			0
three other recipients have some political pull , including @entity113 commissioner @entity112 , @entity9 's ' buddy ' @entity114 , and @entity115 who co-owns the restaurant chain with @entity98			2
the dispute stems from an incident where the 66 - year - old allegedly got into a verbal altercation with restaurant manager @entity121 when @entity9 tried to get his favorite table on the night of his wife 's surprise birthday party			1
powerful pals : @entity9 prides himself on his celebrity connections , seen here with prince @entity127 at a polo match close : @entity9 ( right ) sent an email complaint to the owner of @entity92 and cc'ed a number of celebrities including @entity23 ( second right )			1
though in this picture , @entity133 , her husband @entity134 , and @entity135 did n't get the email he reportedly walked up to an occupied table and asked the group who was dining there to move so that he could have ' his ' table			0
a bartender told the paper that the group refused and he offered to pay their bill if they would agree			0
@entity9 , who calls himself ' @entity147 - the no. 1 @entity148 ' , then left an irate message for @entity121 , who was not at the restaurant at the time of the interaction			2
she did not call him back immediately so he went to the restaurant on 57th street to have it out with her in person			0
' he called me the c - word and said he would kill me , ' @entity121 told @entity158			0
@entity9 claimed that @entity121 was supposed to meet him at his office to plan the party in question , so he went to the restaurant to give her a piece of his mind			2
' i told her " i ca n't stand you			0
" did i curse at her or threaten to kill her ? no true - please			0
i would never say that , ' @entity9 told the paper			2
feeling like his message may not be clear , @entity9 decided to send the email to @entity98 and copy his a-list pals			2
leading ladies : @entity9 has been pictured with @entity170 ( left ) and model @entity171 ( right ) ' i guess that @entity172 much too busy to call back an upset customer			2
i had told u that i had a @entity175 & a very uncomfortable experience concerning a surprise party for a very very close friend this past weds , ' he wrote in the email			0
@entity9 , who owned drug manufacturer @entity17 until he sold it for $ 1.3billion in 2010 , went on to talk about his wealth in the email , using it as an unexpected way to rub his business savvy in @entity98 's face			1
upset : @entity9 took issue with how he was treated at @entity186 in @entity187 ' i had only 3 employees & revenues of only $ 40,000 ... when i recently sold my company last year i employed almost 2,000 employees n revenues of $ 5,000,000,000 ( thats what 5 billion ( @entity193 ' as in @entity195 ... ' he wrote in the angry - and typo - laden - email			1
now , @entity9 is no longer welcome at any of the 25 international @entity92 locations			1
given his affinity for self tanner and trademark uniform of purple t - shirts and yellow @entity203 sunglasses , it would be easy to spot him if he tried to sneak in			0
this is far from the first time that @entity9 has used his connections to make a point , as he was described in a @entity209 profile of showing off his hundreds of photos with various celebrities			2
and he has no problem expressing his distaste for others : he openly bad - mouthed @entity215 , calling him ' the most selfish guy i know out of the 500 celebrities on this wall ' , and had a pr back - and - forth over a slight to comedian @entity220			0
but others in the celebrity world paint a different picture of @entity9 , a man they say donates generously and has made a huge impact on the charities close to the rich and famous			2
among them is @entity230 owner @entity229 , who told the @entity36 that he has ' nothing but great things to say about [ @entity9 ] and his generosity			0
@entity147 has got a soft spot for those in need			0
' similar skin colors : @entity9 , seen here with close friend @entity114 , also sent the real estate mogul the email complaining about the service he received at @entity92 banned : now @entity9 is no longer welcome at any of @entity92 's 25 locations around the world			1
