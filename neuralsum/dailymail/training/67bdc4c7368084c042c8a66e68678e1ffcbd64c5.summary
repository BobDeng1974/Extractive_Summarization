many of us already rely heavily on technology for everyday tasks , but the very technology we need to get through the day could soon be after our jobs - and the shift could happen much faster than we think			1
claims made by an expert in artificial intelligence predict that in less than five years , office jobs will disappear completely to the point where machines will replace humans			1
the idea that robots will one day be able to do all low - skilled jobs is not new , but @entity17 , ceo of @entity19 artificial intelligence company , @entity18 , said the pace of advance is much faster than originally thought			1
the @entity22 invited teams to design mobile apps using @entity25 's , pictured , cognitive computing capabilities			2
the 25 finalists will now submit prototypes for judging , after which only five teams will present proposals to @entity22			0
three winners will get access to the @entity25 's developer platform a study by recruitment service @entity37 has discovered the fastest growing job titles of the past five years			1
they include : @entity42 engineer @entity44 developer data scientist @entity47 designer staff accountant paralegal @entity51 developer administrative assistant @entity54 developer business intelligence developer from this list , @entity42 engineer , @entity44 and @entity54 developer and data scientist did n't exist on @entity37 list in 2008			1
‘ i 'm afraid it ’s now a reality that most clerical workers will disappear			1
this has profound implications for jobs of course , but huge technological advancements are being made all the time and artificial intelligence ( @entity70 ) has now become very sophisticated to the extent that it can think and learn like a human , ’ he said			1
@entity70 , for example , can carry out labour intensive clerical tasks quickly and automatically , while the latest models are also capable of making decision that would traditionally be made by humans			1
@entity17 said his company had been assessing the industry and found that the pace of change was accelerating more rapidly than @entity84 bodies and others had prepared for			1
‘ [ @entity70 ] can read and understand the meaning of entire documents by learning the patterns of words and phrases in context			0
it ’s this ability to learn - and learn from the natural consequence of processing documents - that is minimising the need for clerical workers to carry out these repetitive tasks			1
‘ the fact that a machine can not only carry out these tasks , but constantly learn how to do it better and faster , means clerical workers are no longer needed in the vast quantities they once were			1
' for example , a machine can recognise duplicate claims filed to insurance companies by knowing it has seen a phone number or an address before			1
more importantly , whenever human intervention is required , @entity70 learns from this and therefore further reduces the dependency on clerical workers			2
a robot developed by researchers from @entity116 uses @entity118 sensors , 3d cameras and a database of household task videos to anticipate their owner 's needs			0
for example , it scans the surrounding area for clues and when it spots an empty beer bottle , can open the fridge , pick up a full bottle of beer and hand it to its owner robots are also used by the police and military as bomb - disposal experts , for example , pictured the case is already being seen with many online retailers using automated customer service agents			0
earlier this year , technology firm @entity22 turned its supercomputer @entity25 into a robot call centre			0
the artificially intelligent computer system took on the role of a customer service manager called the @entity148			0
the service uses @entity22 's @entity151 technologies to gather data about customers and make sure the answers are best suited to them			0
@entity25 can then personalise its responses based on the company , and the type of customer , for future calls too			2
robots are also used by the police and military as bomb - disposal experts , for example			0
earlier this year , students from @entity116 invented a robot that can fetch food and drinks , do the housework and carry out other everyday tasks			0
while researchers from @entity172 built a robotic barman called @entity174 in @entity175 , or @entity176 for short			0
but this advantage can come at a cost			0
according to a report filed last year by the @entity180 , the greatest loss of jobs between 2010 and 2020 is predicted for administrative , clerical and secretarial occupations			1
this is set to amount to 387,000 jobs			2
mr @entity17 continued : ‘ @entity70 is sophisticated enough to know if a correspondence is a complaint and then how important it is			0
for some people this is difficult to believe which is why we have to demonstrate it live			2
seeing is believing after all			0
independent ai expert , @entity193 - who wrote @entity194 - said by 2025 , machines will be able to learn , adjust , exercise judgement , and re-programme themselves			1
this is already seen in apps such as @entity22 's @entity200 app , pictured ‘ the perception of ‘ too good to be true ’ is diminishing as more companies adopt @entity70 to accelerate and improve profitability , customer service and shareholder value			0
@entity17 added that @entity70 was a ‘ game changer ’ and although it could affect jobs , there were much greater benefits for the customers			2
machines can significantly increase productivity and therefore reduce costs			2
they can improve customer service , compliance , scale and efficiency			0
independent @entity70 expert , @entity193 - who wrote thinking @entity194 which explores the impact of technologies on everyday life - agreed			0
‘ while it was once mainly lower - skilled jobs squeezed by new technology , @entity70 could undercut the ‘ knowledge ’ professional			2
‘ by 2025 , machines will be able to learn , adjust , exercise judgement , and re-programme themselves			1
‘ the hardest hit would be professionals working in sales , education , healthcare , it , management , finance and law – knowledge - based jobs , where analytics tools , mobile internet devices , apps or web - based services such as the cloud can be developed to outperform humans			1

claims were made by ceo of @entity19 artificial intelligence company , @entity248
he said clerical jobs could disappear completely in ' less than five years '
people in sales , education and it among the *employees* most at risk
by 2025 , machines will be able to ' learn and *reprogramme* themselves '
