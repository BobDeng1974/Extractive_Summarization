@entity0 is fast becoming seen by fans , and possibly even by his manager , as @entity4 's premier right back , after impressing in the absence of @entity6			1
the young @entity7 scored his second @entity9 goal , cutting inside and curling left - footed past @entity10 , in the 4 - 1 win over @entity13 last weekend , and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top - level full back			2
but , it seems , in the dressing room , it is his status as the club 's premier sprinter , rather than as a defender , that is most in question , after he beat @entity25 's 40 metre club sprint record last summer			1
@entity0 scored a brilliant goal to put @entity4 ahead against @entity13 last weekend at the @entity27 @entity0 has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured @entity6 at right back this season ' we were just having a test and then they told me i was the fastest at the club , ' @entity0 told @entity34			1
' i did not beat it by that much			0
there was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now			0
' @entity0 shaved a hundredth of a second off @entity25 's time , prompting the 26 - year - old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season			1
and since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right - back of some promise , progressing well beyond @entity50 's expectations			2
' i am happy that now , after not so good performances in the beginning , the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes			0
@entity0 has exceptional pace , as he proved in august when he set a new @entity4 record over 40 metres @entity25 had previously held the record , but @entity0 shaved one hundredth of a second off his time but @entity25 is determined to take his record back from @entity0 this summer and be speed king again ' the chances always come through injuries , which is not a nice thing			1
now we are going to have @entity6 back and i am happy for him , but when you get your chance , you need to do the best you can			0
i have done my best to take this opportunity			0
' with @entity6 on the verge of match fitness , @entity0 will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity			2
but after his brilliant goal at the @entity27 last weekend , one thing is for certain - he is no longer known just for being quick over 40 metres .			0
