@entity1 ’s late try was the difference as @entity3 beat @entity4 20 - 14 in the last @entity6 derby between the teams before the @entity3 are relegated to the @entity8			1
matches between the two neighbours were season highlights through the 2000s as both clubs battled for @entity15 supremacy , but friday ’s encounter at a rain - sodden @entity17 was a world away from those days			1
moments of quality were few and far between in a match punctuated by errors			0
@entity24 winner : @entity1 goes over for a late try as @entity3 beat @entity6 rivals @entity4 on - loan winger @entity26 , a @entity4 academy graduate , gave @entity3 a fifth - minute lead , only for it to be wiped out by @entity29 ’s effort			1
the scrappy nature of the match continued after the break , with tries from @entity34 and @entity35 both coming on the back of ball spills			0
@entity34 ’s penalty gave the @entity3 a 12 - 10 advantage heading into the final 15 minutes but @entity40 appeared to have given the @entity4 bragging rights			1
however , @entity1 took @entity34 ’s offload and jinked his way to the line to send the @entity3 fans wild , before the latter ’s last - minute two - pointer made sure of @entity3 ’s second major scalp in as many weeks			1
delight : the soon - to - be relegate side celebrate @entity1 's late winner @entity3 have had the better of their @entity6 derbies with @entity4 in @entity15 despite their recent woes and the four - time champions were quickest out of the blocks against a @entity4 side missing a host of stars			1
@entity34 ’s break gave the @entity3 good field position and the scrum - half then kicked for the corner , where @entity26 profited from a mistake by @entity66 to touch down			1
@entity4 were finding it difficult to match @entity3 ’s early enthusiasm and it took a storming run by prop @entity71 to spark them into life			2
his charge downfield took the @entity4 deep into the @entity3 half before @entity4 shifted the ball from left to right and levelled through @entity78 , who showed good footwork to evade @entity81			2
the hosts looked to be in again when @entity83 galloped towards the @entity3 line after pouncing on a @entity3 mistake in his own 20 , but he was hauled down by @entity86			2
roar : @entity34 is congratulated by team - mates after going over in the first half all was not lost for @entity4 as @entity90 was sin - binned for preventing @entity83 from getting a quick play of the ball			0
the @entity4 failed to make the @entity3 forward pay for his indiscipline and were forced into a reshuffle themselves when @entity97 hobbled off with a leg injury			2
@entity40 replaced the @entity100 - bound winger and his early fumble summed up a poor opening 40 minutes			0
the second period got off to a promising start as @entity90 and @entity105 both made good yards after breaking the line			0
hope : @entity35 scores for @entity4 at @entity17 but it was another error which led to the next score , @entity66 again spilling a kick , this time allowing @entity34 to tap ahead and touch down			0
it was @entity4 ’ turn to profit from a mistake next , @entity111 picking up close to the @entity3 line after @entity114 ’s pass had gone to ground before going over			0
@entity3 edged ahead once more when @entity34 slotted over a penalty from in front after the @entity119 were penalised for holding down			0
@entity4 hit back again through @entity40 ’s try after @entity121 was first to a @entity123 kick but @entity1 stepped his way to the line to give @entity3 their first win over the @entity4 in six attempts .			1

@entity1 late try the difference at @entity17
