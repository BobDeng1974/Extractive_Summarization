the park 's owner said the animal would not be put down because ' it was not the tiger 's fault ' @entity12 said he did not know why the employee put her hand into the cage with the tiger this is not the first time the @entity7 has been at the centre of controversy , and the 54 - acre park , which is located outside @entity158 , has had previous run - ins with regulators			1
@entity161 is licensed by the federal government because it 's open to the public - charging admission to come very close to what @entity12 calls the largest ' refuge ' for ' unwanted ' animals in the world			1
the park is home to nearly 170 big cats : lions , tigers , leopards , and about 800 other animals , including camels , monkeys and exotic birds			0
he also runs a controversial breeding programme , selling tiger cubs - only to zoos , he says - for up to $ 5,000 each and , at the same time , cross-breeding exotics like ‘ ligers ’ , a cross between a lion and tiger , and even what he calls a tuliger , a mix of a liger and a tiger , according to @entity194			1
however , @entity12 admits he does not have a background in zoology or veterinary medicine			1
‘ i grew up a farm kid , and that 's pretty much my background , ’ he told @entity194			0
over the years , @entity161 has come under scrutiny by the @entity203 @entity202 ( @entity202 ) for concerns ranging from ' public contact with dangerous animals ' to a ' lack of physical barriers '			2
the park is home to nearly 170 big cats : lions , tigers , leopards , and about 800 other animals , including camels , monkeys and exotic birds records show that , in 2006 , it had its license suspended for two weeks and paid $ 25,000 for ' facilities violations '			0
it is currently under investigation by the @entity202 for the death of 23 tiger cubs between 2009 - 2010 , according to @entity194			1

but @entity12 says it is not true however , @entity12 says that they have ' never had an accident here at this facility '			2
' i most confident that our visitors here at the park are safe			0
we have spent milions on building our cages to where our park is safe			0
no one is allowed to go into a cage with an animal , ' he told the @entity98 on saturday evening			2
according to @entity12 , today 's incident should ' not reflect on exotic animals or on any zoo being safe or not '			1
' we do n’t know why she stuck her arm into the tiger			2
' @entity281 , president and ceo of the @entity230 , says @entity161 is ‘ a ticking time bomb ’			2
according to @entity194 , @entity12 responded to the comment saying , ‘ it is a ticking time bomb - if somebody thinks they 're going to walk in here and take my animals away , it 's going to be a small @entity290			2
’ he said : ‘ i have poured my entire life into what i do , to care for animals			0
nobody is going to walk in here and freely shut me down and take my rights away from me as long as i am not breaking the law			0
’ the owner says he has ' poured his life ' into the park ' to care for animals ' a @entity290 - type tragedy in @entity303 , @entity304 , in october 2011 , saw the owner of an animal park , @entity305 , release 56 dangerous animals into the wild before committing suicide			0
forty - eight of his animals were eventually killed by authorities concerned over public safety , pushing @entity304 lawmakers to author a bill restricting private ownership of exotic pets			0
the @entity230 is currently urging the @entity203 @entity202 to adopt regulations banning public contact with dangerous wild animals no matter the age of the animals			0
current regulations generally allow public contact with tiger cubs between the ages of 8 and 12 weeks , and encourage the reckless over breeding of tiger cubs and surplus of captive adult tigers			1
baby cubs : current regulations allow public contact only with tiger cubs up to the age of 12 weeks the @entity225 is also urging @entity338 to pass @entity339 4122 , the @entity340 and @entity341 to prohibit the private ownership and breeding of tigers and other dangerous big cats			1
however , @entity12 says a ban would not stop accidents happening			2
' you can ban public contact with animals till the cows come home , but that does n’t mean it stops employees from breaking protocol , ' he told the @entity98			0
according to @entity12 , the accident was ' not the zoo ’s fault '			1
' an employee made a mistake and we ’re paying for it			0
she was an excellent employee , and she is more than welcome to have her job back			0
' he said it was ' next to impossible ' to hire more staff members because it was ' hard work ' being employed at the park			0
' you come to work here to clean cages and scoop poop			0
this is not about cuddling with full grown tigers , and a lot of people think that it is			0
' ' we have a high turn over because this is very hard work , ' he told the @entity98			0
@entity12 said he is planning to release a six - song country - western music album , titled @entity383 – the @entity384 , with music videos , on november 15 to ‘ help fund tigers in the wild ’			2
@entity12 says the accident was ' not the zoo 's fault ' and banning contact with wild animals was not the solution the @entity225 is also urging @entity338 to pass @entity339 4122 , the @entity340 and @entity341 to prohibit the private ownership and breeding of tigers and other dangerous big cats stable condition : a female employee was mauled by an adult tiger on saturday but survived the attack and did not lose her arm			1
