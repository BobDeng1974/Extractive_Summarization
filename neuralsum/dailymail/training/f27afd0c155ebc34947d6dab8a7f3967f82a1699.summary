@entity1 's sister left court in tears today after accusing a self - confessed hitman of mouthing abuse at her during her brother 's sentencing hearing			1
@entity8 claims underworld gun - for - hire @entity9 mouthed ' f * * * you ' after she expressed discomfort that he was occupying seats normally reserved for the sprinter 's family			1
the dispute came on another dramatic day in court as the @entity18 battled to avoid a jail term for killing his girlfriend @entity20			0
it began with warm applause for judge @entity24 's 67th birthday , but descended into scenes of near farce with the @entity1 family demanding immediate police protection			1
mr @entity9 , who arrived at court shortly before the lunch break , claims a police officer motioned that the only seats available were next to the @entity1 family			1
in a separate incident , she left court in tears after accusing a hitman of mouthing abuse at her hitman : @entity9 , the self - confessed killer of @entity44 mine magnate @entity43 , claims he and a friend were told by the @entity1 family to move from their seating area ' like we were dogs ' but within ten minutes taking his seat , tattooed mr @entity9 had stormed out of court , claiming the athlete 's family had told him and his friend to move ' like we were dogs '			1
complaining loudly to reporters , he said : ' who do they [ the @entity1 family ] think they are ? do they think they own the front row ? ' once judge @entity24 had adjourned for an early lunch , the clearly distressed and tearful miss @entity8 reported the incident to her brother @entity63 , prompting him to ask for immediate police protection for the family and for mr @entity9 to be banned from court			1
outside the @entity68 high court , mr @entity9 joined two friends - both known rivals of the double amputee - where he gave an impromptu television interview to deny miss @entity8 's story			2
he said : ' clearly the @entity1 family are a bunch of liars , just like @entity1 ' adding with a heavy hint of sarcasm : ' they are the victims , always the victims			2
' he denied mouthing any abuse			0
mr @entity9 , whose immunity from prosecution for his role in the 2005 contract killing of mining magnate @entity43 was ironically negotiated by @entity83 , is not known to have any direct ' bad blood ' with 27 - year - old @entity1 , unlike the two friends who flanked him outside court			2
steely glare : @entity1 walks past former @entity44 footballer @entity88 , who claimed the athlete once threatened to break his legs after believing he had slept with his then girlfriend @entity91 former @entity44 footballer @entity88 ( in white shirt ) accompanied mr @entity9 outside court @entity1 is said to have threatened to ' break the legs ' of @entity88 , a retired footballer , whom he suspected his girlfriend @entity91 of cheating on him with , and @entity99 , who sent the athlete flying to the floor after they were involved in a scuffle at a nightclub in july			2
as the burly trio of mr @entity9 , mr @entity99 and mr @entity88 huddled together rather menacingly at the entrance to the court house during the lunch adjournment , @entity1 narrowly missed a potentially excruciating encounter			0
as the @entity18 gold medallist strode purposefully up the road in search of lunch , a gaggle of police officers had to run to catch up with him to offer rather tardy protection			0
today was not the first appearance that mr @entity9 has put in court			0
on tuesday , he sat with mr @entity99 , mr @entity88 and @entity119 on benches reserved for the @entity20 family and their friends			0
their glowering presence clearly unsettled @entity1 in the dock , leading his uncle @entity129 , the patriarch of the sprinter 's family , to have his nephew escorted home from court by police out of ' fear for @entity1 's safety			0

@entity8 claims self - confessed killer @entity9 mouth ' f * * * you '
she fled court in tears , prompting her brother to demand police protection
he claims @entity1 family told him to move from seats ' like he was a dog '
