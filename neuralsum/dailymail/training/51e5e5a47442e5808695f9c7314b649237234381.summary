by @entity0 published : 22:15 est , 16 december 2012 updated : 10:15 est , 17 december 2012 @entity3 @entity2 satellites are due for a cosmic collision of sorts monday after concluding a 15 - month mission to map the gravity signature of @entity9 's nearest neighbor			1
scientists last week set the @entity12 spacecraft , named @entity13 , respectively , on course for a crash - landing into a lunar crater near the moon 's north pole			1
but do n't expect to see any sky - borne flashes , as @entity13 are , as one researcher put it , ' washer - and - dryer - size spacecraft with empty fuel tanks			0
' we 're not expecting a flash that is visible from @entity9 , ' grail principal investigator @entity33 told @entity36			1
the two satellites are reportedly about to run out of fuel , and were guided to the location to avoid an estimated 1 - in - 8 million chance they could plunge into a historically important part of the moon , like where the @entity45 astronauts landed			0
blast off : the $ 496 million grail mission - short for @entity12 - launched in september 2011 , and @entity13 reportedly arrived in lunar orbit about three months later			1
they are scheduled to hurtle into the crater at 3,760 miles - per - hour 20 seconds apart at 5:28 p.m. mission team members told @entity36			2
' they 're going to be completely blown apart , ' grail mission manager @entity53 of @entity2 's @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity52 reportedly said			2
added @entity33 : ' this is all according to plan			0
' the $ 496 million grail mission — short for @entity12 — launched in september 2011 , and @entity13 reportedly arrived in lunar orbit about three months later			2
grail 's primary science mission ran from march to may , during which the spacecraft zipped around the moon at an average altitude of 34 miles			2
@entity13 dropped down to about 14 miles above the moon for an extended phase			0
and the mission was - by all accounts - a success			0
' grail has produced the highest - resolution , highest - quality gravity field for any planet in the solar system , including @entity9 , ' @entity33 reportedly said			1
the resulting map has revealed an incredibly pulverized lunar crust , @entity33 added , suggesting that the moon , @entity9 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 were pounded by long - ago impacts far more violently than previously thought			1
mission managers on friday turned off @entity13 's science instruments and ordered a maneuver putting them on course for the rim of the crater , which reportedly sits at a latitude of 75.62 degrees north and a longitude of 26.63 degrees east			0
crash landing site : the map shows the region where the twin spacecraft of @entity2 's @entity12 mission will impact on monday a successful mission : the map created by @entity13 has revealed an incredibly pulverized lunar crust , suggesting the moon , @entity9 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 were pounded by long - ago impacts far more violently than previously thought			1
the violent demise of @entity13 should provide mission scientists with information about the properties of the crater rim , perhaps shedding further light on lunar composition			1
it 's also possible the probes ' impact will expel water ice or other volatiles into the wispy lunar atmosphere , where they can be detected by @entity2 's @entity114			0
new moon : this locations on the moon that @entity2 considers ' lunar heritage sites ' and the path @entity12 will take to avoid hitting any of them impact : these 3d renderings show the lunar mountain targeted by the grail mission for controlled impact of the @entity13 spacecraft researchers reportedly said the @entity114 has been studying the crash site and will attempt to do so again during and after the impact			1
but the grail team does n't necessarily expect to see ice			0
the crater rim is in sunlight much of the time , and the spacecraft just are n't big enough to kick up much stuff			0
mapping the moon : using a precision formation - flying technique , the twin grail spacecraft -- @entity13 -- have mapped the @entity142 's gravity field , as depicted in this artist 's rendering .			0

impact will not be visible from @entity9 , say scientists
action follows end to a successful mission
