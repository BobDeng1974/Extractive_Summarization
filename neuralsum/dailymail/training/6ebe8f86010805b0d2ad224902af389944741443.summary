' all the fans in @entity3 , they all have total trust in me			1
because i have one thing in my heart , that is @entity3			2
so they have trust in me and i would say to them all , you can trust me on this one			0
i have investigated every single aspect i can , i think @entity0 has been so unlucky			2
