left his post : army sgt. @entity2 walked away from the army and was captured by the @entity4 in june of 2009 the former @entity6 admiral @entity5 knew that @entity8 sgt. @entity7 deserted his post in 2009 , claim three of the controversial soldier 's comrades			1
the men say that @entity5 , who served president @entity12 and then secretary of defense @entity13 six years ago , was certain that @entity2 had fled the army and was guilty of desertion			1
the claims mean that @entity5 was in a position to tell the president his soldier had run away five years before national security adviser @entity21 told the world that @entity2 served honorably			1
it also casts a huge shadow over the deal to swap five @entity4 commanders for @entity2 that culminated in a @entity28 ceremony hosted by @entity12 to celebrate his release and attended by his parents			2
' i asked him ( @entity5 ) if he knew about @entity2 and that he deserted and he ( @entity5 ) told me that he knew of the circumstances surrounding his walking off , ' said former sgt. @entity35 told @entity36 , ' and that they were developing leads and following leads , trying to do everything they could to get him back			1
' this development comes one week after officials scheduled a july hearing for the @entity8 sergeant who left his post in @entity46 and was held by the @entity4 for five years			0
@entity2 says he walked away because of ptsd and is not a deserter			2
@entity49 claims he and two other collegagues , @entity51 and @entity52 , were providing security for @entity5 while he was on a trip to @entity46 in december 2009 - six months after @entity2 was captured			2
@entity49 claims that during an unguarded question and answer session , @entity5 said they could ask him anything			1
' so @entity35 asked him , you know @entity2 deserted , what 's going on with that ? and admiral @entity5 said , ' yes , we know all the circumstances surrounding @entity2 walking away from the @entity65 ( outpost , ) and we 're still working on getting him back , figuring out where he is and kind of figuring out that whole situation			1
' scroll down for @entity69 admiral @entity5 , former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , allegedly told three comrades of @entity2 that the soldier was a deserter specialist @entity52 confirmed that this is what @entity5 said as did @entity51			1
' i do n't remember him being taken aback by it at all , you know , he knew what was going on , he answered not confidently but he did n't have to think about it , he did n't want to give us some political answer , ' @entity51 explained to @entity36			2
' he just gave us an answer			0
' according to former @entity86 aides this means it is inconceivable that @entity5 would not have told president @entity12 and raises questions as to the prisoner swap for a known deserter			1
' if @entity5 knew , and now it 's alleged that he did know , it would be , it would be unthinkable that he did n't pump this up the chain of command , his chain of command , or , tell the president directly , ' said @entity99 , a former @entity101 @entity86 staffer to @entity102			1
' at a minimum , this would have been included in the president 's daily brief , and at a maximum , it would 've been told directly to the president by @entity5			2
' days after his rescue ( right ) , @entity2 ( pictured left in a video released by the @entity4 in 2010 ) was in stable condition at a @entity114 military hospital in @entity115 @entity114 president @entity12 stands with @entity117 ( r ) and @entity118 ( @entity119 ) as he delivers a statement about the release of their son , prisoner of war @entity8 sergeant @entity2 , in the @entity28 at the @entity86 in may , 2014 @entity5 spoke to @entity102 and defended his decisions			1
' from the moment sgt. @entity2 went missing , the @entity126 was focused on finding him -- as it does with any serviceman or woman who goes missing			2
the exact circumstances were not known then , nor did they drive our decisions			0
we do not leave our people behind			0
' @entity35 said that he wants to know what his superior officers knew and when they knew it			2
' i want to ask him ( @entity5 ) did they brief the @entity86 ? who knew about it and why would you still do this trade knowing all the information that you knew ? ' said @entity35			1
' we do n't leave anyone behind			0
the thing is , we never left him ( @entity2 ) behind			0
he chose to walk off and do whatever and get captured , that was his fault			0
' @entity2 is charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy			1
@entity8 officials announced thursday that his @entity155 hearing will be held july 8 at @entity156 , @entity157			0
that proceeding is similar to a civilian grand jury			0
from there , it could be referred to a court - martial and go to trial			0
officials say @entity2 walked away from his post in @entity46 and was captured by the @entity4			0
he was then released from @entity4 control in a prisoner exchange last may for five @entity4 commanders			0
he faces up to life in prison if convicted of misbehavior before the enemy .			0
