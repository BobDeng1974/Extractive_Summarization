princess has grown so big she has had to move to mrs @entity12 's mother 's house in @entity43 , @entity44 ' she can be an absolute diva when i am around to spoil her			2
' the ewe , who was named after a @entity48 winner , originally looked like she would n't make it through the night when she was born in april 2012 , but mrs @entity12 nursed her back to health and has been devoted to her ever since			1
the unusual house pet is doted on by her owner , who took turns hand - rearing princess with her husband @entity55 for two months in their kitchen in @entity13			0
princess has a very sweet tooth and is particularly partial to @entity10 and @entity9 mrs @entity12 said she is a ' princess ' in her eyes : ' @entity15 was a bit masculine so we added the princess but as far as i 'm concerned she is a princess			1
' she has now grown to such a healthy size that she is to big for the @entity66 ' home and has had to move to mrs @entity12 's 89 - year - old mother 's croft in @entity43 , @entity44 , but she still visits princess every other day			2
the greedy ewe has a very sweet tooth , which mrs @entity12 indulges by feeding her @entity9 and @entity10			1

' ' people think that sheep are stupid but they are really clever animals			0
@entity16 nearly did n't make it when she was born in april 2012 , but mrs @entity12 nursed her to health ' when my mother was poorly one day , princess @entity15 went into the house and climbed up the stairs where she started prodding my mum in her bed			1
' she even cries when we return home after going to visit her - it 's heartbreaking			0
' when the @entity106 celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary recently , @entity12 's only wish was for a portrait of @entity16			2
