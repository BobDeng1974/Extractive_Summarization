a pair of amateur @entity2 stargazers have discovered a new planet – for only the third time in history			1
@entity6 and @entity7 spotted the new world during a project to find planets beyond our solar system publicised by professor @entity13 in his stargazing live series			0
the pair will receive the honour of having the planet named after them , once scientists have confirmed its authenticity			1
@entity21 : an artist 's impression shows the potential new planet discovered by two ' citizen scientists ' on a planet - hunting website they made the discovery after spotting changes in light patterns in an image from @entity34 ’s kepler space telescope			1
the unusual patterns suggested a planet appears to be orbiting a sun called @entity38 , which lies between 600 and 3,000 light years away			1
‘ @entity42 ’ , as the planet will be known , is thought to be gaseous , and around the size of @entity41			1
helping out : the public look at time - lapse images of stars on @entity46 to check for any blips in light that could indicate a planet marking history : the volunteers are then asked to mark any anomalies on a graph how it works : as the planet passes over the star , the brightness of the star dims			1
this can be picked up on the time - lapse images from @entity34 's @entity62 telescope the image had been posted online at @entity64 , an @entity66 project that asks the public to sift through time - lapsed data from @entity34 in the hope of new discoveries			0
mr @entity6 , of @entity71 , said : ‘ i ’ve never even had a telescope			0
' i ’ve had a passing interest in where things are in the sky , but never had any more knowledge about it than that			0
‘ being the one to find something is a very exciting position			0
’ but the other amateur stargazer , mr @entity7 , may not even know he is set to have a planet named after him , as the project ’s team have not yet been able to reach him			1
dr @entity88 , from @entity66 , said : ‘ the candidate planet is unlikely to have life because it is too hot			1
' it is too close to its star and the sheer heat makes life unlikely			0
’ it is believed to be only the third time @entity2 amateurs have found a new planet			2
the first was @entity101 , who discovered @entity102 in 1781			0
@entity34 's kepler space telescope launched in 2009 and has been beaming back pictures of stars similar to our @entity106 ever since			0
its time - lapse images plot any periodic dips in light that occur when a planet passes in front of a star			2
these dips , called ' transits ' , have to be observed several times before a new planet can be confirmed			2
@entity6 , the @entity2 citizen scientist who has discovered a potential new planet after observing a transit , has only found one pass			2
however , the @entity120 team has since found other transits in its archives for that star suggesting the planet could be genuine .			0

the planet is thought to be gaseous and about the size of @entity41
