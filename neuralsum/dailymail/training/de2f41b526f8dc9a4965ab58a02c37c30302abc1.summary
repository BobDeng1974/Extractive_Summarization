by @entity0 published : 04:13 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 04:13 est , 6 october 2013 the home secretary announces will announce plans to deport thousands of foreign criminals under tough new rules - many before they have been prosecuted a quarter of @entity9 's organised gangs are operated by foreign criminals , it has today been revealed			1
an official study of @entity9 's criminal world - to be released tomorrow - is expected to say that there are more than 5,500 organised criminal gangs operating in the country - with 25 per cent run by international syndicates			1
security sources say the greatest threat to the @entity9 comes from @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity25 and @entity26 are also causing concern			1
it comes as the home secretary announces plans to deport thousands of foreign criminals under tough new rules - many before they have been prosecuted			1
of the 37,000 gang members ' targeting @entity9 ' according to the @entity34 - 7,400 are classed as ' high harm ' foreign criminals , the @entity32 reports			1
the @entity34 said new measures to be outlined by @entity38 on monday aim to identify , disrupt and eject foreign criminals operating within our shores while also stepping up protective measures to stop them reaching @entity9 in the first place			1
she will tomorrow launch the £ 450mn @entity45 ( @entity45 ) - dubbed @entity9 's @entity46 - as she reveals that organised crime is costing the @entity9 £ 34bn a year , with cybercrime costing a further £ 2bn			1
new measures will see immigration officers based in police stations , who will identify overseas criminals and whether they are here illegally			0
they will immediately run background checks for previous convictions and to see if they are wanted abroad			0
if there is enough evidence , they will be prosecuted here then deported			2
but if there is insufficient evidence to prosecute them in @entity9 , and they are found to be here illegally , or to already have a conviction abroad , they will be deported			2
anyone deported will be banned from the country for a decade			0
a pilot scheme in @entity69 - codenamed operation @entity68 - has seen 1,000 foreign criminals were kicked out in just 18 months			1
as the scheme expands across the country , officers will join forces with @entity76 police to tackle cross-continental gang syndicates			0
the @entity32 reports that many of the organised crime groups commit economic crime , with foreign gangsters - operating from @entity82 and the @entity83 - targeting the pensions of hard working people with ' pension liberation funds '			2
they typically use false websites and advertising to coax people to cash in their pensions by transferring them to a fake early access scheme			0
a @entity34 spokesman said : ' @entity68 , the joint @entity94 information sharing programme , has seen more than 1,000 foreign criminals kicked out of the country in the 18 months it has been in operation			1
' it tackles individuals who may not have been convicted but where intelligence exists that shows a pattern of arrests or association with serious criminality			0
it has already been exported to @entity107 and will now be expanded to the rest of the country as part of the @entity111			0
' the strategy will also expand the traditional anti-gang targets of gun and gun crime to include the emerging threats of human trafficking , child sexual exploitation and cyber crime			0
' and it will seek to strengthen @entity9 law enforcement work overseas , which last year saw the seizure of over 60 tonnes of cocaine and nearly 5 tonnes of heroin and the arrest of 1,500 people			2
' planning for the @entity45 , which will be accountable to home secretary @entity38 , has been under way for the past three years			2
the new body will take on the roles of the old @entity134 and @entity135 ( @entity136 ) , parts of the @entity133 , @entity131 , and the police ’s @entity137			0
it represents the culmination of an effort that began in the 1970s , with the first attempts to make the @entity9 ’s 45 police forces work more closely together – and then to the creation of forerunners such as @entity136 and the now defunct @entity146			2
supporters are determined to avoid the pitfalls which beset earlier efforts			0
@entity136 , which was chaired for three years by former @entity151 boss sir @entity150 , was widely criticised for pursuing too few cases .			0

greatest threat from @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24
security forces say @entity25 and @entity26 are also causing concern
thousands of foreign criminals will be deported before they are prosecuted
