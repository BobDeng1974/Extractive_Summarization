simple lifestyle changes could see 80,000 people saved from dementia every year , a major research project has found			2
the study suggests that people make changes earlier in life to cut the risk of developing the brain disease as they grow old			1
it says three million cases of dementia could be avoided in @entity12 by 2040 if people started regularly exercising their bodies and minds			1
a major research study has found that exercising the mind - by completing puzzles or playing chess - as well as the body can cut the risk of developing dementia the results of the study - which looked at the benefits in 1,200 men and women in their 60s and 70s - are due to be formally presented at the @entity29 in @entity30 in february			1
its chairman , surgeon and former @entity35 health minister @entity34 said people should act quickly to change their diet and exercise and stimulate their brains through puzzles			1
he said this could help to prevent a ‘ tide of suffering ’ which could overwhelm the country , which already has an estimated 800,000 dementia sufferers – half of which are undiagnosed			0
writing in the @entity46 , he said individuals should adopt a ‘ use it or lose it ’ attitude to their brains			2
former @entity35 health minister @entity34 said people should act quickly to change their diet and exercise and stimulate their brains through puzzles he wrote : ' the degenerative brain condition that strips sufferers of their dignity and humanity is among the most feared of all those that afflict our species			1
' it is one of the greatest health challenges we face			0
' the surgeon warned the public should not wait for a cure to be found , adding : ‘ at an individual level we need to look after our brains – sharpen those chess skills , pick up that crossword and solve that puzzle			2
’ and he said there was evidence mental decline may start in the late 40s			0
he said : ‘ eating a healthy diet , avoiding obesity and getting plenty of exercise are all important to brain health because what is good for our hearts is also good for our heads			1
’ the study saw half of the 1,200 men and women make changes to their diet and embark on brain training			1
their hearts were also managed and they increased social activity			0
the report suggests many cases might be avoided if action was taken to reduce blood pressure - it said untreated blood pressure in mid-life could give a person a 60 per cent higher chance of developing dementia			1
type 2 diabetes linked to weight gain was also said to be a key cause			0
it also suggests 13,000 cases a year are linked with depression , 4,000 to obesity and inactivity , and 2,000 to smoking			1
but the report warns : ' there is no known intervention that can definitively prevent dementing diseases			0
' yet @entity34 said the results marked a ' significant breakthrough ' in showing that individuals could curb the effects of dementia			1
the study - which looked at the benefits in 1,200 men and women in their 60s and 70s - also found that getting plenty of exercise is important for brain health 1 regular exercise doing exercise three to five times a week for between 30 minutes and an hour is recommended			1
in the @entity12 , adults are urged to do 150 minutes of activity a week to promote health but barely a third manage it			2
2 give up smoking never smoking is recommended , but smokers who give up by the age of 40 can gain ten years of extra life , claim scientists			0
3 reach a healthy body weight a healthy weight is a ‘ healthy ’ body mass index ( @entity146 ) score			0
@entity146 is assessed by comparing height to weight , in a calculation which divides weight in kilos by height in metres squared			0
a healthy score is between 18.5 and 24.99 - above is overweight and obese			0
4 eat a @entity155 diet the @entity155 diet is high in fish , nuts , whole grains and ‘ healthy ’ fats such as those in olive oil , while low in red meat and dairy products			2
studies suggest three to five or more portions of fruit and vegetables with fat making up less than 30 per cent of calories			2
5 keep alcohol consumption low low or moderate alcohol consumption is classified as three or fewer units per day for men , two or fewer for women , with abstinence not treated as a healthy behaviour			0
a small 125ml glass of wine contains 1.3 units , while a pint of beer contains at least two units .			0
