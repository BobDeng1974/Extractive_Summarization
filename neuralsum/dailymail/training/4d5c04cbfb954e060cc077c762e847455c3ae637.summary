now i must have painted 100s of different people			2
' i started initially painting your size 8 and size 6 fashion models but have gone to paint athletes because it 's actually a real workout holding the posing for 18 hours , six minutes in position and five minutes being painted back and forth			1

' ms @entity8 trained under renowned body painter @entity102 before becoming a master herself			2
wheels of fire : ms @entity8 's aim was to take the stereotypical image of beautiful women posing with a motorbike and turn it on its head by making the bike from the bodies @entity113 fit : ms @entity69 looks as stunning as her motorcycles after being expertly painted in ( from left ) the sports bike , cruiser bike and dirt bike outfit beautiful bodywork : the models hold their poses while ms @entity8 accessorises with a final lick of paint her latest work features the three types of motorbikes that will be touring the @entity20 this year with the @entity127			1
