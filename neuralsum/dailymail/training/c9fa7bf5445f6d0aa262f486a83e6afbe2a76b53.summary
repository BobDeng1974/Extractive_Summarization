by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 13:21 est , 8 february 2013 on a clear day , it is said that visitors to the @entity3 can see @entity4			2
but despite the panoramic views offered by scaling @entity8 's highest building , it is poor value for money in comparison to other skyscrapers across the world			0
a ' height to price ' ratio , balancing adult admission price against the height of the buildings , reveals why some visitors to the tower of steel and glass have felt aggrieved at the weighty admission costs			1
poor value : the @entity3 , @entity8 's highest building , is the worst value for money for those looking to experience views from some of the world 's most well - known skyscrapers			2
the graph measured the cost of admittance on the door for one adult against the height of the buildings pricey : adults visiting the @entity3 , which opened to the public earlier this month , can expect to fork out £ 29.95 ( $ 47 ) on the door having opened to the general public earlier this month , adults visiting the £ 500m building can expect to fork out £ 29.95 ( $ 47 ) on the door			1
a family of four will be charged more than £ 87 for the 30 - second elevator trip to the building 's 68th floor viewing platform			1
but standing at only 800ft ( 244m ) , the @entity3 's viewing platform compares poorly against other global skyscrapers offering the chance to gaze at stunning vistas			1
the best value can be found at @entity58 's @entity57 building , with a viewing platform at 1285ft ( 392m ) , costing an adult only £ 9.70 ( $ 15.25 )			1
vista : standing at only 800ft ( 244m ) , the @entity3 's viewing platform compares poorly in terms of admission costs with against other global skyscrapers huge : the building , standing at an impressive 1,016ft , has 72 occupiable floors , other buildings providing significant @entity68 in @entity69 and the @entity70 in @entity71 with a viewing platform at 1,353ft ( 412 metres ) costing £ 11.45 ( $ 18 ) for an adult on the door			1
@entity76 's @entity75 boasts an observation deck at 1,122ft ( 342 metres ) costing £ 20.45 ( $ 32 )			2
despite criticisms of the @entity3 's entrance fees , and indeed its design , its views across @entity83 - said to stretch 40 miles with good visibility - have been described as the most sought - after views in the @entity86			2
the building has 72 occupiable floors , but with further floors narrowing to a point , and it stands as high as an 87 - storey building , scraping the sky at an impressive 1,016ft			0
first look : the first visitors to the top of the @entity3 enjoy the view over a wet and rainy @entity83 february 1 alternatives : among the buildings offering better value than the @entity3 , are the taipei 101 building in @entity58 , left , and @entity69 's @entity68 it is comfortably six times taller than @entity104 ’s column , but still 438ft short of the @entity68 ; and it is dwarfed by the 2,717ft @entity106 in @entity107 , the world ’s tallest building			1
the skyscraper is part of a 2m sq ft development in @entity112 called @entity113			0
the @entity3 and its sister development @entity116 are linked with @entity117 through a new central plaza , public realm , bus station and train station concourse			0
the @entity3 ’s tenure at the top of the @entity125 height chart is likely to be short - lived , as the 1,089ft @entity126 in @entity127 is set to be completed by the end of the year			0
a spokesman from @entity130 from @entity3 said : ' it is a premium visitor attraction , providing a unique , queue and crowd free experience of one of the world ’s greatest cities			0
its prices are in line with fast - track ticket prices for many other visitor attractions in @entity83 and around the world			0
' as the highest vantage point from any building in @entity8 , and almost twice as high as any other vantage point in the city , it is the only place where you can see the entire city of @entity83 at once			0

ratio measures adult admission price on the door against building 's height
