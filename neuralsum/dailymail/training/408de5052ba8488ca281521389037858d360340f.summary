you may have moved to a new area , or swapped your mobile network , only to find that you could n't get decent mobile coverage any more			0
but now phone owners can check the strength of @entity6 and 3g coverage in their area before committing to a new contract using this new tool			0
an interactive map shows coverage hotspots throughout the @entity13 on key networks - @entity14 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
click below to explore network coverage in your region phone owners can check the strength of coverage in their area before committing to a new contract using a new interactive map that shows coverage hotspots throughout the @entity13 on key networks including @entity14 , @entity16 , three and @entity18			1
online phone retailer @entity28 is hosting the tool , which was created by @entity30 based on data crowdsourced from users of the its app which helps users find better mobile phone signal in real - time for example , the map shows that @entity17 has the best 3g and 4g coverage in @entity41 with an average @entity6 download speed of @entity43			1
but at the other end of the country , in the south west of @entity47 , @entity18 has the best coverage for @entity49 and @entity6 with an average @entity6 download speed of @entity51			1
the map also shows how variable areas can be			0
@entity14 has the best 3g and 4g coverage in @entity55 , with an average download speed of @entity57			1
it was created using crowd sourced data from @entity30 's app and is now being offered as a tool by online phone retailer @entity28			0
london calling : this map shows @entity49 mobile coverage across the networks for @entity55			0
it also reveals that @entity14 has the best 3g and 4g coverage in @entity55 , with an average download speed of @entity57 according to the map , the average @entity6 speed is currently @entity70 , with the strongest signal , as expected , in the country ’s largest cities			1
but significant rural areas of @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity41 and @entity77 , however , receive weaker signal with slower speeds			1
leading the way for coverage is @entity14 , which covers 75 per cent of the @entity13 population over 300 towns and cities and offers the best overall performance			1
although there was a slow roll out of @entity6 networks and infrastructure between mid- 2013 and 2014 , competition between networks has led to a faster spread of @entity93 , coverage and a wider choice of plans for consumers			0
these 4g plans have led to competitive promotion of @entity6 from major retailers , offering budget smartphones with @entity103 capabilities from £ 10 per month			0
and speeds are expected to increase			0
this portion of the map shows network coverage for @entity41 and the @entity109 of @entity47			0
three has the best 3g and 4g coverage for this area with an average @entity6 download speed of @entity43 the uptake in @entity6 use has risen dramatically across the @entity13 within the last year			1
sales data gathered from the retailer shows that only 2 per cent of consumers were purchasing 4g contracts in april 2013 , compared to an average of 85 per cent in 2014			0
the expectation is that next year , @entity6 will be the only option offered in new contracts and upgrades , with @entity49 only used when 4g connectivity is not available			0
however , despite its growing popularity , @entity13 performance is yet to match the average speeds of other countries , such as @entity130 , which has an average of @entity132			2
this is closely followed by @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , which all have averages of @entity138			0
using advanced settings ( pictured ) it is possible to see the average speeds available in certain areas for different networks			2
this screenshot shows that @entity17 has the best coverage in @entity146 and @entity147 with an average @entity49 speed of @entity149 @entity6 is growing in popularity in the @entity13 and it is predicted that contracts will only offer 4g connectivity as soon as next year			1
according to the map , the average @entity6 speed is currently @entity70			1
however , @entity13 performance is yet to match the average speeds of other countries , such as @entity130 , which has an average of @entity132			2
this is closely followed by @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , which all have averages of @entity138			0
@entity134 ’s @entity161 network offers the fastest speed at @entity163 , over @entity164 faster than @entity13 ’s @entity14 , which reaches up to @entity165			2
@entity166 provides the most coverage to users with a 91 per cent average , compared to the @entity13 ’s average of 56 per cent			2
@entity173 ’s @entity172 network offers the best coverage by individual network with 98 per cent , compared to @entity13 ’s @entity14 which provides @entity103 coverage to 75 per cent of @entity13 population @entity166 recently introduced ‘ @entity183 ’ mobile broadband , which itself offers download speeds of up to @entity181 , and the @entity13 can expect to see this technology rolled out in 2015			2
in the @entity13 , @entity14 is switching to live 4g + and @entity18 ’s own version of @entity185 , is being rolled out with expectations that speeds will reach @entity188			1
@entity14 has been testing the improved technology since late 2013 , and expansion across key @entity13 cities is expected over the next year , while @entity18 has already launched @entity185 across sites in @entity193 , @entity55 and @entity194 , with further expansion of the network expected into 2015			1
@entity197 , digital manager at @entity28 , said : “ despite a slow start , the @entity13 has made significant progress in the provision and speed of @entity6			2
where there is some catching up to be done in comparison to some countries , the major networks understand the consumer and the need to create a better connected world			0

the *heatmap* shows a true **reflection** of @entity213 , 3g and 4g signal available to users throughout the @entity13
it features average speeds for cities , towns and individual *postcodes* for three , @entity14 , @entity18 and @entity16
all data is crowd - sourced to give a genuine **reflection** of connectivity being *accessed* across the country
for example , @entity14 appears to have the strongest coverage across @entity55 , but @entity17 is the best in @entity76 , on average
it reveals that the average @entity6 speed is currently @entity70 , with the strongest signal in cities including @entity55
rural areas of @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity41 and @entity77 , however , receive weaker signals with slower speeds
