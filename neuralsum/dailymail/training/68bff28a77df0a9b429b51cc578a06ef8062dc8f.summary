miss @entity74 , from @entity75 , @entity76 , who stated she ' loves dr who ' added : ' i was just getting frustrated about how many people misunderstood where i was coming from			0
' i do n’t think people appreciated what it felt like for myself and others to sit in front of the telly watching them tear hair out , it just was n’t right			2
@entity61 is a condition where a person feels compelled to pull their hair out - either from their head , or places such as their eyebrows or eyelashes			1
the condition is an impulse - control disorder - a psychological condition where the person is unable to stop carrying out a particular action			0
sufferers experience an intense urge to pull their hair out - and growing anxiety until they do			1
once they have achieved their goal , they feel a sense of relief - despite their actions often causing bald patches			0
@entity61 can cause negative feelings , such as guilt			0

it is not known what causes trichotillomania , but there are several theories			0
some experts believe hair pulling is a type of addiction , others believe it may be a symptom of a mental health problem and a way of relieving stress or anxiety			1
in some cases , trichotillomania may be a form of self - harm , where a person will deliberately harm themselves as a way of seeking temporary relief from emotional distress			2
source : @entity153 ' i ca n’t even talk about it without triggering others , this is quite difficult for me to verbalise what i am trying to say			0
' the thing is , if those actors in the scene were performing a different type of action that was similar to more well - known form of self - harm then i think more people would have picked up on it			2
' because it was trichotillomania , trichotillomania is not rare but unknown , no one really cares because they do n’t know there is a disorder where people actually pull out their hair			1
' i am aware that the @entity11 did not specifically include that scene to cause harm , for all i know they might not know trichotillomania exists			1
' i know it was n’t a malicious act towards " trichers " , also i appreciate that there are just some times where you ca n’t research everything			0
' if everyone had to think before they spoke to create any content then no one will be able to voice anything through fear of triggering or upsetting anybody else			0
concluding , she said herself and others found the scene ' upsetting ' but added she does n’t think much can be done regarding the issue before saying her ' rant ' was over			0
it is estimated that there are one million sufferers of trichotillomania the @entity229 with most of them being women			2
