the mp accompanied one of the alleged victims to a police station while he made the allegations that triggered mr @entity1 ’s bombshell arrest last weekend			1
last night the mp , whose identity is being withheld by @entity16 , said : ‘ it is important for legal reasons that i make absolutely no comment			2
’ the revelation that mr @entity1 ’s arrest was caused by one of his own party colleagues will add to the sense of shock that the incident has caused at @entity27			1
it is also likely to intensify behind - the - scenes debate over whether the @entity31 mp should continue to carry out his commons duties while detectives investigate			2
mr @entity1 says the allegations that he raped one man and sexually assaulted another , over a period dating from 2009 to last month , are ‘ completely false ’			1
he has not been charged with any offences and has been bailed until june 19			0
last week , after what he described as the ‘ worst two days of my life ’ , the deputy speaker returned to the @entity40 , where he was greeted warmly and publicly by colleagues on both sides of the @entity43			0
he has temporarily stepped aside from his official duties , but says that he intends to return to the chair of the chamber once the debates on the @entity48 are over			0
@entity1 gave a statement at his home in @entity51 , where he said that allegations he raped one man and sexually assaulted another are ' completely false ' however , some mps are privately advising speaker @entity54 that mr @entity1 should step down completely while he fights to clear his name			1
most @entity56 @entity53 support him staying in the chair , while a majority of @entity53 are opposed			0
the @entity60 are ‘ hopelessly divided ’ on the matter , a source said			0
@entity62 has deployed ten officers on the investigation , called @entity65 , and has been in contact with the @entity67 – the official in charge of @entity40 security – about the parliamentary procedure to follow if officers decide to search mr @entity1 ’s office			1
@entity1 has temporarily stepped aside from his official duties the force is treading carefully in the aftermath of the row five years ago when the then @entity79 , @entity80 , granted consent for police to search the @entity27 office of conservative frontbencher @entity83 without a warrant as part of an investigation into @entity89 leaks			1
no charges were ever brought , and @entity91 said that she ‘ deeply regretted ’ accepting a police request to keep the operation secret			0
mr @entity1 has confirmed that in 2009 he was interviewed by the then @entity56 chief @entity96 @entity95 over allegedly making an unwanted advance to a man he was drinking with , but has said that it was a ‘ misreading of signals ’			1

he has said it was the result of a massage for a tension headache			0
the @entity109 parlour mr @entity1 visited confirmed that it offered tension headache treatment , but insisted that its masseur could not have inflicted the mark			2
a spokesman for @entity62 said : ‘ we are speaking to a number of people in connection with this investigation , but as this is an ongoing criminal inquiry we will not be providing any further detail			0
‘ we would encourage anyone who has experienced sexual abuse or who has information about it to have the confidence to report it to us			0
’ mr @entity1 refuses to talk about any details of the allegations while the police investigation is in progress			2
but in a statement after his arrest , he said : ‘ the allegations are completely false and i ca n’t understand why they have been made , especially as i have continued to socialise with one [ of his accusers ] as recently as last week			1
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
