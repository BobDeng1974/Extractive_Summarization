by @entity0 published : 11:42 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 20:06 est , 27 march 2012 according to legend , a black fox brings bad luck , but an amateur photographer could hardly believe his good fortune when he spotted the rare animal near his house			1
it is believed to be only the second time a black fox has been spotted in @entity11			1
@entity12 , 58 , from @entity13 , near @entity14 , @entity15 , saw the creature , with its distinctive white - tipped tail , in fields behind his home			1
rare spot : @entity12 , 58 , from @entity13 , near @entity14 , @entity15 , saw the creature , with its distinctive white - tipped tail , in fields behind his house yesterday ' my neighbour thought it was a stray dog but i looked through my binoculars and realised it was definitely a fox , especially because of its white - tipped tail , ' said mr @entity12 unusual : the black fox is so rare that wildlife experts believe there are only a handful of the breed left in the country lucky : @entity12 from @entity13 in @entity36 his wife @entity37 , 64 , first spotted what she thought to be a black sack blowing in the wind last week			1
mr @entity12 then spotted it for himself last thursday but it has disappeared by the time he managed to get his camera out			1
he then spent four days watching for the black fox , which has a distinctive white - tipped tail and is believed to be one of just a handful in the country			1
' i 've heard black foxes are mythical creatures because they supposedly do n't exist , ' he said			2
' my neighbour thought it was a stray dog but i looked through my binoculars and realised it was definitely a fox , especially because of its white - tipped tail			1
' i did n't realise how rare it was until i did some research			0
an @entity59 officer told my neighbour the organisation had never seen one before as they are that rare			0
the black fox is in fact an ordinary red fox which has black fur or is going through a phase where the colour of its fur is particularly dark			1
the phenomenon is normally seen in growing cubs and generally the fox will develop to have a dark chestnut coat			2
but a few red foxes will remain black due to a rare genetic flaw dating back hundreds of years			0
only a handful of them are thought to exist in @entity11			2
unwelcome sight : in medieval times , the black fox was considered a bad omen by superstitious villagers colouring : the black fox is in fact an ordinary red fox which has black fur or is going through a phase where the colour of its fur is particularly dark in @entity91 tradition , black foxes are bringers of bad luck			1
rural communities used to tell of a fox as ' black as night , so that it could live in a man 's shadow and never be seen			2
' centuries - old superstitions are often found attached to black animals , such as black dogs and black cats			2
it is thought to originate from when the black dog was said to bring disaster and doom to whoever saw the animal			0
in @entity110 , villages were very afraid of the sighting of a black fox and considered it to predict trouble or bad luck			1
in @entity118 , foxes with black coats are often found with a variable amount of white or white - banded hair in the dark coat			1
mr @entity12 added : ' i first saw the black fox last week so when it appeared again yesterday i was ready with my camera			1
' i managed to get within 100 metres of it but then it ran off			0
' i was really pleased with the photos			0
i wanted to get them because when we spotted it before no one believed us			0
' they thought we must have been mistaken , but from these pictures there 's no mistaking it			0
' mr @entity12 even believes there is a second black fox living in the fields			1
' i caught a glimpse of a second one but i 'm not sure if it 's a cub or a male and female fox , ' he added			0
the red fox was introduced to @entity118 by the peans and black foxes exist in much greater numbers there because they were not hunted as widely			2
in the @entity11 their pelts were highly prized in the fur trade and it is believed the genetic strain became much scarcer			2
only one other black fox has been spotted in @entity11 before in @entity157 , @entity158 in 2008			1
some people took it as a bad omen as only a few weeks later the banks in @entity11 nearly collapsed			2
but it seems the bad luck was turned inwards and a few weeks later a woman found the dead animal on her farm in @entity168 , near @entity169 , @entity158 , after it had been seen by neighbours hanging around the area , looking gaunt			0
@entity172 : only one other black fox has been spotted in @entity11 before in @entity157 , @entity158 in 2008 in a graveyard - but it was found dead weeks later @entity174 , 48 , from @entity175 in @entity157 , spotted the animal on september 8 whilst he was out walking and managed to take pictures and record footage			1
at the time , he said : ' i thought it was the @entity181 looking at me			0
then i thought , " it 's a myth , there 's no such thing "			0
but i managed to get right up to it and it 's definitely a young black fox			1
' on hearing it had died , he added : ' what a shame			0
at the time it looked weary and like it was on its last legs			0
i 'm pleased that i managed to get a picture of it			0
far from being unlucky for me it brought the sunshine and dry weather for the harvest			0
