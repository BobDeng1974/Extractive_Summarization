by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 13:39 est , 30 january 2013 preparing to fight the @entity1 together is not , perhaps , the most conventional start to married life			1
but then corporal @entity4 , 26 , and his @entity5 wife @entity5 , 23 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , met through the @entity9 's @entity8 in @entity10 three years ago			1
so they always knew it was a possibility			0
though perhaps even they did n't think their deployment to @entity15 would come so soon - one year after getting married			2
happy anniversary ! @entity5 and @entity4 think they are luckier than most soldiers who have to leave their civilian partners at home in sickness and in health : @entity5 and @entity4 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , will spend the first half of 2013 on the @entity25 front line with a group of 25 soldiers from the @entity28 the couple , who married on 28 january last year , are celebrating their first wedding anniversary together by starting military training ahead of being sent to @entity15 for a six - month tour of @entity25 in march			1
so instead of settling into their second year of married life with gravy boats and plans for babies , the @entity34 will spend the first half of 2013 fighting the @entity1 with a group of 25 soldiers from the @entity28 - who are helping regular troops in an effort to drive out insurgents			2
they are currently training for their upcoming mission which will involve supplying ammunition and equipment to front line troops			0
and despite being posted to @entity48 together , @entity4 and @entity5 are likely to be given separate duties , meaning the will only see each other at evening meals			1
@entity5 , who graduated from @entity52 in 2011 , joined the @entity9 on the advice of her brother @entity54 , who is also a @entity5 and served in @entity15			1
the cookies : the couple , who married on 28 january last year , have been nicknamed ' @entity59 ' by their @entity9 colleagues happily ever after : @entity5 and @entity4 on their wedding day in january 2012 , just one year before they began training in preparation for being deployed together to @entity15 married life : rather than spending their first anniversary having a romantic meal , @entity5 and @entity4 will be training for an upcoming six - month tour of @entity25 @entity5 , from @entity10 , @entity7 , said : ' i 'm really excited , as well as a little nervous			1
this is what we train for and , as a soldier , i think it 's something you have to experience			0
' although being in the @entity9 means we do n't see each other as much as we like , i actually think it has brought us closer together - it 's a passion for both of us			1
' my family are very supportive , but a bit worried , so it 's comforting to them that my husband will be out there to look out for me			0
' we are luckier than most in that we will be together during our training but if we are separated out there , it could be difficult , especially if one of us goes outside the wire			0
' that said though , at least we will know what the other one is thinking and i imagine it will be easier than waiting at home			0
' happy days : lieutenant colonel @entity99 , who selected the couple for the tour , said ' they are both excellent soldiers ' and ' make a brilliant team ' @entity4 , who is in his eighth year with the @entity9 and served in @entity104 in 2007 , added : ' i joined because i saw the red sign for the @entity106 while driving through the streets and wondered what it was all about			1
' this is my second major deployment and i ca n't wait , to be honest			0
this is what i joined the @entity9 for			1
' i ca n't wait to get out there			0
being in a relationship with someone in the @entity9 has obvious difficulties , but when you 're both in the @entity9 , it brings an entirely new set of problems			2
' it would almost be easier for me if @entity5 was at home so i would know she was safe , especially if one of us has to go outside the wire			2
' having said that , at least i know i 'm close enough to get to get to her if something bad should happen and we â€™ll see each other for short periods of time			0
' we do have a bit of banter , but we 're like a big family and everyone has been very supportive			0
' the couple have been nicknamed the cookies by their @entity9 colleagues			1
lieutenant colonel @entity99 , who selected the couple for the tour , said : ' i 've watched them get to know each other over the years			2
' they make a brilliant team			0
they are both excellent soldiers and will serve us well in @entity15			0
' together forever : @entity5 and @entity4 are both excited about being sent to @entity15 , and hope they will be able to see each other when they are out there			1
