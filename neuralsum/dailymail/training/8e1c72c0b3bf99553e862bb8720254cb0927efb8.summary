by @entity1 reporter tragic : @entity2 , pictured right with friends , was trying to calm down the gunman when he was shot in the head the murder case where a homeowner allegedly shot an @entity9 vet dead after he caught the man 's relative urinating on his property has now turned into a legal battle over land rights			1
@entity15 had grown weary of the partying canoeists and rafters who encroached on his neatly kept property along @entity20 's @entity19			1
when he caught @entity22 as he was about to relieve himself on a gravel bar by his yard last month , a nasty confrontation ensued that ended with one person dead and @entity15 accused of killing him			1
the case against @entity15 is the latest to put a spotlight on ' castle doctrine ' laws , which allow the use of deadly force to protect property			2
@entity20 is among at least 30 states that have enacted the statutes , which supporters say protect gun rights but others insist promote vigilantism			2
prosecutors interpreted the actions differently , as witnesses who testified at a hearing this month said @entity15 was angry and raging , shooting into the crowd of people , narrowly missing two others before killing 48 - year - old @entity22 of @entity47			2
@entity15 , 59 , has been charged with second degree murder			0
@entity15 lives in a small white frame home on a shaded gravel road about eight miles west of @entity51 , the self - proclaimed floating capital of the world			2
tens of thousands of people come to the region every year to raft , canoe or kayak down the @entity19 and nearby rivers			0
charged : @entity59 , 59 , pictured , confronted the group of family and friends with a 9 mm handgun and shot dead @entity2 , 48 , after they stopped for a break at a gravel bar in @entity66 drinking is sometimes part of the outings , resulting in bawdy behavior that does n't sit well with owners of land that touches the river			1
many have complained for years about loud parties , trash left behind and crude behavior			0
on july 20 , @entity77 , a carpenter , and around four dozen other members of an extended family gathered at a campground for their annual float trip along the @entity19			1
a few hours into the trip , @entity83 and @entity84 stopped their canoe on a gravel bar			1
@entity83 , who had drunk about three beers , decided to relieve himself , he testified at the preliminary hearing			0
legal battle : @entity15 , seen here at a preliminary hearing in @entity93 on august 16 , faces a second degree murder charge uninvited guests : @entity15 and many other neighbors had apparently complained for the frequent tour groups who regularly drank during their trips down the @entity19 @entity15 confronted @entity84 and other members of the party			0
when happened then is in dispute , and will be a crucial part of the case			0
@entity84 said it was only after @entity77 was shot that members of the party picked up rocks to defend themselves against @entity15 , who was armed with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol			1
' i 'm standing there unarmed and the guy 's got a gun , ' @entity84 said			0
@entity15 did n't testify at the hearing , but his attorney gave a different account			0
in an interview with the @entity119 , @entity15 's attorney @entity117 said @entity15 politely asked the float trip party to leave			1
' the response he got was angry and profane , ' @entity117 said			0
whether or not the floaters were on @entity15 's property may be an issue in the case since @entity20 law is n't clear on where private property along a waterway begins			1
friends : @entity22 , pictured center with his wife @entity132 and niece , left , went on a floating trip every year in the same area horror : @entity22 , pictured , was shot in the head in front of his wife @entity132 , pictured left , and died on the way to hospital some experts say it starts at the vegetation line ; others say property rights extend to the center of a river or stream			1
@entity20 's castle doctrine statute , enacted in 2007 , gives residents a legal right to defend themselves and their property against intruders			2
supporters of such laws cite a number of cases in which homeowners were able to fend off burglars or other criminals without fear of prosecution			0
but @entity164 's law gained notoriety after a neighborhood watch activist , @entity166 , fatally shot teen @entity167 , and was acquitted of criminal charges .			0

@entity59 , 59 , shot @entity2 , 48 , in the head
@entity77 and his family and friends stopped at a gravel bar at the bottom of @entity15 's property for a break during an annual floating trip
@entity15 approached with a handgun and told them to get off his land but the group *refused* , claiming it was public property
the argument *escalated* and @entity15 shot @entity77 as the unarmed man was trying to calm him down
the laws in @entity20 are *extremely* vague about property rights along streams and rivers and who can legally access them
