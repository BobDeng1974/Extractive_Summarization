on one of her regular visits to her mother ’s care home , @entity0 noticed something was n’t right			2
her mother @entity6 , 71 , suffered from @entity7 ’s and had moved into the home five months earlier			1
despite her dementia , when @entity6 went to @entity9 and @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , in may 2010 , she was still a lively woman , enjoying a joke with her family			1
crucially , she was also able to walk around quite freely			0
bed sores can be the result of nursing care provided by unqualified staff , who may fail to recognise or report signs of potentially serious skin problems , say experts within a few months , however , the former nursing assistant had lost mobility			1
by october , she spent most of her time in a chair and , although her children did n’t initially know it , was suffering from at least one bed sore ( also known as a pressure sore or pressure ulcer )			1
by november , she was largely bedridden , and her limbs were very stiff			1
‘ my brother and i did n’t make the connection at the time , but i ’d noticed an odour like rotting flesh , ’ says @entity0 , 54 , a charity chief executive from @entity32 , @entity33			0
‘ we wondered if they were washing her properly , but when we brought it up with the staff , they said it was nothing			0
‘ eventually , they told us she had a “ sore ” , but they ’d been looking at it			0
’ then in early january , @entity6 was moved from the residential side of the building to the nursing unit , where she was found to have a number of grade - four bed sores — the most severe kind — on her left hip , right hip and buttocks			1
her condition continued to deteriorate , and she was admitted to hospital suffering kidney failure , and sepsis ( blood poisoning ) , related to the bed sores			1
she died on march 3 , 2011 , with seven bed sores , including two grade three , and one grade four			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , pictured : despite her dementia , when @entity6 went to the nursing home she was still a lively woman bed sores occur when a patient lies immobile for a period of time , unable to get up and move around or shift their weight			1
the pressure disrupts the flow of blood through the skin , so it becomes starved of oxygen and nutrients and begins to break down , leading to an ulcer forming			0
these are often found on the heel , back and elbows			0
there are four grades : a reddening or bruising of the skin is classed as grade one ; broken skin and shallow ulceration , grade two ; and large , deep ulceration , grade three			0
grade four ulcers are so deep that in many cases the skin and muscle has completely worn away , revealing bone , and sometimes internal organs			0
the most severe ulcers are very difficult to heal and can lead to a fatal infection or life - threatening complications such as gangrene or blood poisoning			1
experienced nursing staff : guidelines from the @entity109 say any patient considered at risk of bed sores should be turned regularly and put on a specially designed foam or electrically powered air mattress ( posed by model ) some 540 hospital patients and 227 care home residents ’ deaths had bed sores as a contributing factor in 2011 , according to figures from the @entity122 , while bed sores were also the main cause of death for another 78 hospital patients ( and 39 care home residents ) that year			1
even when the sores do n’t kill the patient , they can cause terrible pain , and lead to immobility			1
‘ pressure sores acquired in care homes or hospitals of grade three or four are preventable through good , basic nursing care , ’ says @entity132 , chief executive of the @entity134 charity			2
this means regularly ‘ turning ’ the patient			0
an estimated half a million people in the @entity143 develop bed sores each year			1
and shocking new figures from the @entity146 show that one in 20 patients has them			2
the statistics were based on data collected from nearly 200,000 patients in july this year ( most of these were in hospital , a small proportion in residential care homes and nursing homes )			2
‘ it ’s quite scandalous that bed sores are being allowed to happen at such an alarming rate , ’ says mr @entity132			1
‘ the cost in pain and misery and the cost to the @entity146 in treatment are enormous and it ’s a sign of neglectful care and under - staffing			1
’ bed sores are estimated to cost the @entity146 up to £ 2 billion a year in care costs			1
to tackle the problem , it was announced last year the sores would be included in a list of 60 ‘ patient outcome measures ’ used to assess quality of care — with hospitals losing some of their budget if they fail to meet targets			2
the @entity178 points out that the shocking new data is actually an improvement , with a smaller proportion ( 5.1 per cent ) of patients suffering bed sores in july , compared with the 7 per cent affected in april , 2012			1
but @entity184 , professor of tissue viability at the @entity186 and a leading researcher on the subject , says while the @entity146 focus on bed sore prevention has had a big impact , the data is not reliable			1
‘ there ’s no standard methodology in the way it is collected			0
the requirements vary between trusts and the methods have changed over time , ’ she says			0
professor @entity198 says some trusts only report the number of patients with sores visited by district nurses on the one day the data is meant to be collected			0
this means the number of patients with pressure ulcers reported each month is not reliable			0
there has also been a trend in reclassifying pressure ulcers as ‘ incontinence lesions ’ or if they ’re on the heel , diabetic foot ulcers , to keep figures down			0
one factor that can lead to bed sores , says professor @entity198 , is that a lot of basic nursing care is provided by unqualified staff , who may fail to recognise or report signs of potentially serious skin problems			1
the cost of bed sores on the @entity146 : it was announced last year the sores would be included in a list of 60 ' patient outcome measures ' used to assess quality of care - with hospitals losing some of their budget if they fail to meet targets ( posed by model ) some 540 hospital patients and 227 care home residents ' deaths had bed sores as a contributing factor in 2011 , according to figures from the @entity122 guidelines from the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) say any patient considered at risk of bed sores is meant to be turned regularly and put on a specially designed foam or electrically powered air mattress			1
but professor @entity198 says the existence of these mattresses can mean people think there ’s no need to turn a patient using them			0
a post-mortem report registered @entity6 ’s bed sores and dementia as secondary causes of death — the primary cause was pneumonia			1
a council investigation found the home failed in its duty of care towards her			0
it noted that despite her being assessed upon admission as being at risk of developing the sores , no plan was carried out to keep @entity6 ’s skin healthy			2
owner @entity270 care homes settled with @entity6 ’s family out of court , admitting it had breached its duty of care			2
it agreed to pay £ 20,000 compensation plus legal costs			2
according to @entity279 , solicitor and medical negligence specialist at @entity281 , the law firm who handled @entity0 ’s claim , bed sores are one of the most common types of medical negligence cases			2
‘ most serious pressure sores should be avoidable and it is inexcusable that mrs @entity6 was found to be suffering with so many at the time of her death , ’ she says			2
‘ a main issue seems to be a lack of training , which meant staff at the home wrongly diagnosed her skin condition [ as a skin tear ] and failed to put in place a skin integrity plan at an early stage , which might have prevented her condition from worsening			0
’ @entity0 says : ‘ putting a plan in place to prevent a patient at risk of developing bed sores seems a very simple thing to do			1
to not do that and then have these things develop is very upsetting			0
’ she adds : ‘ @entity270 is a good name , associated with quality care , so it sticks in your throat when things like this occur			0
while the @entity146 focus on bed sore prevention has had a big impact , the data is not reliable , according to @entity184 , professor of tissue viability at the @entity186			1
there 's no standard methodology in the way the information is collected			0
requirements vary between trusts and the methods have changed over time ( picture posed by model ) ‘ when you suffer from @entity7 ’s you ca n’t communicate well so i ’m sure there was a lot of pain there , which is heartbreaking			0
’ @entity337 , operations director for @entity338 , said : ‘ mrs @entity6 was unwell when she was admitted to our residential unit in 2010 and we transferred her into our nursing unit for increased care and support			2
unfortunately , her health deteriorated further and faster than we expected			0
‘ we fully accept that we did not transfer her to the nursing unit as quickly as we should have done and , on this occasion , we did not provide the high standard of care to mrs @entity6 that we all expect			2
‘ i would like to again apologise to mrs @entity6 ’s family and would also like to reassure them we took immediate action by commissioning a full investigation into the home			0
‘ following that , we retrained our people and now carry out six - monthly refresher training on skin care and moving vulnerable people , to prevent pressure ulcers			0

@entity6 , 71 , entered @entity9 and @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , a lively woman
soon she had lost her mobility and was suffering from at least one bed sore - month later she was largely bedridden
admitted to hospital suffering kidney failure , and blood poisoning , related to the bed sores - she died a few months later
bed sores do n’t kill a patient , but can they can cause terrible pain , and lead to immobility
bed sores are estimated to cost the @entity146 up to £ 2 billion a year in care costs
