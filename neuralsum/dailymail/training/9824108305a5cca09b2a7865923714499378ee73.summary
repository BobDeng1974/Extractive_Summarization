@entity0 has taken a bold step into the relatively unknown by moving to @entity2 but there is more than enough talent , history and potential at the club to make it the perfect coaching comeback for the former @entity11 and @entity12 manager			1
@entity15 's @entity14 football expert @entity13 tells us why ... @entity0 is back in management with @entity2 after his difficult tenure at @entity12 the playing squad in november the league table is still capable of lying and the truth is there is no way @entity2 are the 15th best team in @entity25			1
they have already beaten both @entity27 and @entity28 this season and the group of players that @entity0 inherits will be enough to give them a top - half finish in his first season			1
the club sold @entity35 to @entity36 in the summer but @entity37 is an experienced stand in			0
@entity39 , the big summer signing from @entity41 in @entity42 , is waiting to return from a broken finger suffered in pre-season and 23 - year - old @entity45 is a hugely talented keeper waiting for his chance			0
at the heart of the defence , @entity48 is still only 23 and @entity0 should be able to guide him back to the sort of form that made him many people ’s tip to become a fixture in @entity25 ’s squad and earn a move to @entity36			2
@entity59 signed in the summer from newly - promoted @entity60 , and at 24 , has a bright future at the club @entity63 , pictured here tackling @entity64 , will help provide the defensive stability for @entity0 saturday november 22 @entity66 ( a ) ( 17th in @entity67 ) sunday november 30 @entity69 ( @entity68 ) ( 18th in @entity67 ) thursday december 4 @entity70 ( a ) ( 3rd in @entity71 ) sunday december 7 @entity72 ( a ) ( 8th in @entity67 ) sunday december 14 @entity73 ( @entity68 ) ( 11th in @entity67 ) around him there is stability with @entity77 , @entity63 , @entity78 all having been at the club , and very often in the same back four , for the last four seasons			1
@entity81 is currently out with an achilles problem but @entity59 is an able replacement who signed in the summer from newly - promoted @entity60 and at 24 is another one with a future at the club			2
the central midfield pairing is usually @entity88 and former @entity27 and @entity90 midfielder @entity89 but @entity91 is the diamond in the rough – an under 19 @entity94 champion with @entity25 he was on @entity27 ’s wish list two seasons ago but @entity2 resisted and now all it needs is for @entity0 to help the 22 - year - old fulfill his enormous potential			1
@entity88 ( right ) lines up alongside @entity100 and @entity90 man @entity89 in central midfield in the line of three behind the striker @entity0 will have plenty of talent to call upon			2
@entity105 usually plays centrally and top scored last season with 16 league goals			0
club stalwarts @entity109 and @entity111 are good soldiers who will stand up to be counted			0
the pair have played almost 400 games between them for the club and @entity111 ’s set - piece delivery will be another weapon @entity0 can use to the team ’s advantage			1
@entity121 is another who has lost his way but if the still - only - 23 - year - old midfielder , for whom @entity27 paid £ 4million when he was just 18 , can regain form and fitness , then @entity0 will have one of the most gifted players in the division at his disposal			2
former @entity131 striker @entity105 ( right ) scored 16 times for @entity2 last season leading the line , @entity133 will work hard as a loan striker and @entity136 centre forward @entity135 , signed in the summer from @entity138 in @entity139 where he scored 29 goals in just 31 games , will give @entity0 a more physical option			1
boardroom backing there will not be huge amounts to spend			0
@entity2 are a selling club and if @entity0 manages to bring the best out in players such as @entity48 and @entity91 then the club will be tempted to cash in again			1
but what he will benefit from is one of the best youth academies in @entity94			2
the @entity152 sports city has so often been the foundation of the club ’s success			0
there was a time around a decade ago when the attention switched to foreign signings but the club paid the price ending a 40 - year run in the top division with relegation in 2007			0
it took them three seasons to come back but with a team built on youth they finally won the second division in 2010 and @entity0 will be entrusted as the keeper of that youth team tradition			1
@entity173 holds 32,000 - buoyed by @entity0 ' arrival the fans will rally behind them for the next home game @entity12 ( 2013 - 14 ) p 51 w 27 d 9 l 15 @entity178 53 % @entity11 ( 2002 - 13 ) p 516 w 217 d 139 l 160 @entity178 42 % @entity179 ( 1998 - 2002 ) p 234 w 113 d58 l 63 @entity178 48 % history and support the club ’s @entity173 holds 32,000 and although performances were , in the main , poor last season the average was still in excess of 22,500			1
buoyed by @entity0 ’ arrival they will get behind the team in the next home game against @entity69 and fill the ground for the @entity192 derby on december 14			2
another @entity194 former manager , @entity193 , used to complain about how the running track around the pitch affected the atmosphere but that wo n't stop them creating a cauldron for their visit of their local rivals			0
it is @entity25 ’s ‘ friendly derby ’ perhaps the closest @entity67 has to the @entity206 meetings @entity0 managed during his decade at @entity207			2
the @entity2 fans have endured a tough campaign so far , but will still be hoping for a top - half finish expectations @entity2 were champions in 1981 and 1982 and they also finished runners - up in 2003 but times have changed and the fans know that			1
the annual budget is just south of £ 50m and financially it is not just that they struggle to live with the big two , they are also some way behind @entity28 and @entity223			0
playing well , competing for a @entity225 place and improving the players he has will be how @entity0 is judged			0
if he develops players and keeps the club in the top half of the first division with attractive football then he will not be questioned			0
no - one will expect trophies – a repeat of his results record at @entity11 will keep everyone happy			0
@entity237 coached the club for 322 games winning 126 of them and lifting the @entity240 in 1987 @entity241 boss @entity193 ( pictured in 2007 ) was the last @entity194 manager to have taken charge of @entity2 and topping @entity237 ? @entity237 , as he is always referred to in @entity25 , coached @entity2 for 322 games winning 126 of them and lifting the @entity240 in 1987			1
the man he really wants to beat however is @entity245 , who won those two leagues			0
they were called the @entity248 and even made the @entity250 semi-finals			0
with @entity25 legend @entity252 in goal and fellow internationals @entity254 and @entity256 in attack they took on @entity36 and @entity27 and managed back - to - back titles			1
in their current state back - to - back wins would be nice – @entity0 can do that with victory over @entity66 saturday week when his adventure begins at 10pm , local time .			1

@entity0 has been *announced* as @entity2 manager
@entity0 ' new job at @entity2 could be the perfect coaching comeback after his difficult tenure at @entity12
he inherits a squad 15th in @entity67 , but they are a better team than that
@entity2 are a selling club but benefit from a brilliant youth academy
the club won back - to - back championship titles in 1981 and 1982
but such is their current state , *consecutive* victories are hard to come by
follow @entity0 ' start at @entity2 here
@entity0 will be *officially* *unveiled* as boss on thursday
