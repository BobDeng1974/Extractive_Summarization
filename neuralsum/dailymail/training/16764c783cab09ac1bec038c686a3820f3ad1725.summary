it 's heart - breaking - they were so full of life			2

they were planning to go all the way across @entity27			1
heart - breaking : the couple were described as being ' so full of life ' ‘ i did n't want them to go at all			2
instead of rebooking those flights where you do n't know where you 're going i thought they should have gone to @entity88 and i just felt it was jinxed from the start			0
‘ but they loved @entity3 and were determined to go			1
’ ‘ personally i ca n't believe they 've essentially crossed a motorway in the dark			0

‘ they had only just got to @entity38 when it happened			1
they set off at 6am from @entity144 to @entity27 so i would think that they did n't get there until late at night , so they could n't have done much because they would have just got there and picked up a car			1
they would have been very tired and they may have had a glass of wine			0
‘ their advanced ages were on my mind when they said they were going there			0
i know how tiring a long - haul journey like that is			2
