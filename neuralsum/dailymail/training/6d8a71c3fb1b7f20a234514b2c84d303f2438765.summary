@entity10 contacted the photographer who took the stunning picture through @entity12 to admit she was the blonde - haired woman kissing her handcuffed beau , identified in a police report as 26 - year - old @entity15 , as they were hauled to @entity17 last month			1
@entity18 , who specialises in street photography , snapped the well - timed smooch as he was walking past the court and entered the stunning result , entitled @entity23 , in a picture contest			2

they found love in a hopeless place : @entity10 , 28 , leans in to kiss her boyfriend , @entity15 , in this perfectly timed snapshot after they were arrested so he launched an plea on his @entity12 page begging for the amorous couple to step forward - and a friend of @entity10 's told her she was the subject of a massive search			1
on thursday , she messaged @entity18 through @entity12 to say she was the woman in the photograph			1

' i was just the look - out , ' she insisted , adding that they snatched a kiss as they were led to the court as ' we knew that we were going to be split up once we got to @entity67 '			0
who 's that girl ? @entity10 , pictured , contacted the photographer to reveal she was the woman in the picture			1
she said she was arrested in @entity59 on august 16 while watching her boyfriend allegedly spraying graffiti outside an exlusive bar the loyal lover said she would not identify her 26 - year - old beau as he is still behind bars in @entity79 , but an @entity81 arrest report names the alleged ringleader as @entity15 , 26			1
thumbs up : amateur photographer @entity18 is optimistic about his chances in the competition - and hopes the couple will sign the release forms the report reveals @entity10 , who lives just three blocks from where they carried out their alleged crime , was charged with criminal mischief and making graffiti , while her boyfriend stands accused of criminal mischief , making graffiti , resisting arrest and possession of graffiti instruments			1
now he has tracked the couple down , @entity18 is on a race against time to sign releases from the sweethearts - as the competition has imposed a deadline of saturday for the signatures			1
@entity10 , who has been let out of jail , said she wo n't sign a release for the picture until her sweetheart , a well - known street artist , is also set free			1
but @entity18 , 42 , said he is hopeful they will give their permission when @entity15 is let out - perhaps as early as friday afternoon			1
' we 're hoping to meet altogether , ' he told @entity114			2
' if they want to sign it that will be great as i 'd really like to win the competition			2
if not , i will have no hard feelings			0
' whether or not they agree to sign , he said he has printed them copies of the picture , which @entity126 has already admired			0
in her message , ' she said she loved it , ' he added			0
' maybe they are proud of what they did			0
maybe they think they did something artistic			0
the photograph captures that moment			0
' even if they do agree to sign the release forms , he has the added complication of requiring permission from the police officers who also feature in the image			1
the task of tracking them down was slightly easier - he just zoomed in on their name badges , he said			0
when it came to tracing the lovebirds , he took to social media			0
' help ! ! ! ' he wrote on his @entity12 page on august 17			2
' does anyone know who this couple is ? it is very important			0
