by @entity1 reporter published : 20:49 est , 25 april 2012 updated : 03:09 est , 26 april 2012 hand - me - downs work with unwanted or unsavory clothes , as they apparently do with organs			1
one kidney has made its way to three people in two weeks , in what looks to be a medical first			2
the kidney in question was donated by 21 - year - old @entity12 , who originally donated the organ to her brother @entity14 , 27 , who suffers from a common form of kidney disease			1
when mr @entity19 ’s body rejected the transplant , he chose to pass on the kidney to someone else who could use it			1
and so , 67 - year - old @entity24 , a surgeon and father of five , was the final recipient of ms @entity12 ’s kidney			1
there have been other cases since the 1980s of transplant organs being used more than once , but they were rare and involved instances in which the first recipient died			2
typically when transplanted organs fail in living patients , doctors throw them away			0
but with more than 73,000 people awaiting transplants nationwide , some specialists say doctors should consider trying to reuse more organs to ease the severe shortage			0
' the need for kidney transplantation does n't match our capacity , ' said dr @entity59 , a @entity60 transplant specialist who oversaw the kidney recycling operation in @entity38			1
' people die on dialysis ' while awaiting kidneys			0
that was the possible fate awaiting two strangers			0
a research letter describing the unusual case was published in thursday 's @entity40			2
the donated kidney lasted just two weeks in mr @entity19			1
the same disease that ruined his kidneys started to damage the new kidney , given to him by his sister			2
sibling love : @entity12 donated her kidney to her older brother @entity14 , but his body soon rejected the transplant he was getting sicker , and doctors needed to act fast if they were going to save the organ			1
with permission from the man and his sister , they removed it last july and re-transplanted it the @entity87 surgeon			2
mr @entity19 is back on dialysis and will probably get another transplant eventually			2
still , reusing a transplanted organ can be tricky - and riskier - because surgeons have to deal with scar tissue that typically forms around an organ as the body heals from the operation			1
@entity97 , a bioethicist at @entity98 in @entity99 , said the practice may raise ethical questions			0
he said doctors need to make sure patients who are offered reused parts understand all the risks and are not made to feel coerced into accepting such organs			0
' i just assumed it 's damaged , it 's garbage			2
the fact that they were able to give it to someone that somehow was able to benefit from it was great			0
' - @entity116 and because these cases are so rare , there is little data on how patients with recycled parts fare , @entity97 noted			2
@entity12 had a disease that caused scarring that prevented the kidneys from filtering waste from blood			1
he had to quit his industrial machinery job and went on dialysis a year ago			2
his sister donated a kidney last june in what was ' probably the happiest moment of my life , ' @entity12 said			1
the worst , he said , was a few days later , when doctors told him the kidney was damaged and had to be removed			2
@entity59 , medical director of @entity60 's kidney transplant program , thought the kidney could be reused in somebody else if it was removed quickly , before it became irreversibly damaged			1
@entity59 needed @entity12 's permission , and also asked the young man 's sister , @entity12			1
clandestine meeting : dr @entity59 , transplant nephrologist and medical director of the kidney transplant program at @entity147 , talks with the three in their first meeting mr @entity19 said he was heartbroken and reluctant to abandon an organ that had been his only hope for a normal life			1
but he decided it was the only option that made sense			0
his sister , too , was crushed but said she did n't hesitate when told her kidney might help someone else			0
' i just assumed it 's damaged , it 's garbage , ' she said			0
' the fact that they were able to give it to someone that somehow was able to benefit from it was great			0
' @entity24 was selected because he was a good match			1
but @entity59 said doctors also thought @entity24 's medical background would help him understand the complexities			1
@entity24 said he had never heard of reusing transplant organs , and he worried about taking what seemed like damaged goods			1
but he agreed after the @entity60 team explained the risks and possible benefits			0
the removal and retransplant operations took place july 1			0
within two days , the transplanted kidney had regained function			0
@entity59 said he is convinced the damage is reversed			0
@entity24 is taking anti-rejection drugs and is off dialysis			1
' i finally feel normal , ' he said			0
fearing is back on dialysis and said he is doing ok			0
@entity59 said it is not uncommon for patients with @entity19 's disease to go through more than one transplanted kidney , and he expects fearing will eventually get another one			1
despite his own misfortune , @entity19 said he is ' extremely happy about being a part of this medical breakthrough ' that might end up helping others			0
