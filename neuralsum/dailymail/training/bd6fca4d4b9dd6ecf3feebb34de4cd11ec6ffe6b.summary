by @entity0 follow @ @ adamjshergold she 's best known for solving complex mathematical problems on @entity4 's cult show countdown			2
and now @entity5 has turned her brilliant mind to figuring out something we all want to know - who will win this summer 's @entity10			2
the @entity12 fanatic and @entity14 graduate has been poring over all the data from @entity16 down the years to try and pinpoint the patterns that will tell us which team will lift the famous trophy in the @entity21 on july 13			0
commissioned by bookmaker @entity39 , @entity5 took into account a diverse range of factors including goal average , goal scorers , win rates , climate and geography in a mathematical formula to try and find a winner			0
she found that since the @entity53 @entity10 in 1986 , performances in the qualifying competition have had a significant influence on the outcome of the tournament			1
the key is not to peak too soon and to do just enough to qualify with a win rate of between 50 and 66 per cent			0
close control : @entity5 shows off her ball skills but , despite the top , does n't believe @entity62 will advance too far in the competition it all adds up : a combination of @entity28 's win ratio , qualifying campaign and @entity69 ranking suggests they will be dark horses in the finals this is bad news for the likes of @entity74 and @entity75 , who raced through their qualifying groups and won 90 per cent of their games , and also @entity80 ( 80 per cent ) and defending champions @entity81 ( 75 )			1
@entity28 's qualifying win rate of 56 per cent is just about perfect			1
the second biggest influence according to @entity5 are the goal scoring averages			0
the previous seven world champions only averaged 2.1 goals per game through the qualifying rounds			0
unfortunately , this rules out @entity62 , who averaged over 3 goals a game in their 10 qualifying matches			0
relying on one star player is not the key to success either			0
top scorers in previous @entity10 winning teams scored an average of 4.85 goals during qualification			0
place your bets : @entity5 recommends you put your money on outsiders @entity28 to lift the trophy in the @entity21 on july 13 show your working : @entity5 looked in detail at every tournament since 1986 in order to draw her conclusions this time round , @entity112 scored 11 and @entity113 10 , knocking both @entity120 and @entity121 out of the equation , but their @entity115 neighbours @entity28 had @entity117 and @entity118 on five goals each			1
the fact no nation from outside @entity125 and @entity115 has ever won the @entity10 rules out a swath of teams			2
and no team with odds of 100 - 1 has ever prevailed either			0
no @entity125 team has ever won on @entity115 soil , removing @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 from the mix , leaving @entity27 , @entity136 and @entity28			1
the next factor was that no pre-tournament favourites have lived up to their billing since 1986 and so @entity27 - priced at 3 - 1 - are n't going to do it			1
it now boils down to omens and human reasoning - @entity136 have the easier group but are without star man @entity145			2
big fan : @entity5 received a signed @entity12 shirt from @entity148 to mark her 1,000th appearance on countdown glamorous : @entity5 competing in @entity153 show @entity151 last year @entity28 have the stronger squad and won 2 - 0 at @entity155 against @entity62 back in november - 66 per cent of teams to do so at the new @entity155 have been @entity10 finalists			1
explaining her decision , @entity5 said : ' having crunched all the numbers and stats my maths suggests @entity28 are a good bet to upset the odds at 40/1			1
' they might be amongst the outsiders , but the statistics and form imply they will be this year ’s dark horses			1
they ’ve got a decent team , and although it ’s a tough group , they tick all the boxes and i ’m convinced @entity28 can go all the way			2
' everyone thinks the winner will come from one of the top 10 teams , but the key stats on qualifying performance , goals scored , goalscorers , host nation and current outright odds suggest the likes of pre-tournament favourites @entity27 , @entity185 , @entity81 , @entity74 , @entity134 and @entity132 will be going home empty handed			1
' as for @entity62 , i ’ll be cheering on @entity186 , but i ’m not sure it ’s going to be their year			0

countdown presenter crunched all the facts and figures from every tournament since @entity53 1986
@entity195 concludes that the facts and omens point to dark horses @entity28
@entity27 wo n't be able to handle pre-tournament favourites tag
@entity185 and @entity120 may have peaked too soon , @entity125 sides have history against them
