@entity1 will not join the euro for ‘ the foreseeable future ’ if it breaks away from the rest of the @entity5 , @entity0 insisted today			1
the @entity1 first minister was forced to repeatedly defend his claim that if voters back independence in next year ’s referendum it will not mean having to reapply to join the @entity11			1
and he went further , claiming it was ‘ simply incredible ’ to think @entity13 would not welcome the new independent nation with open arms			2
first minister @entity0 insisted the @entity11 would welcome ' oil - rich , fishing - rich , renewable energy - rich @entity1 ' this week @entity17 is due to sign off the rules for holding the independence referendum in autumn 2014			1
questions about an independent @entity1 ’s place in the @entity11 have dogged mr @entity0 for months , with the @entity22 insisting a new nation would have to make a new application			1
but he said : ' this is a negotiation that will take place after the constitutional referendum of 2014 , of course @entity1 will still be a member of the @entity5 and therefore , by definition , negotiating from within the @entity11			2
' the point of independence does n’t happen until the transfer of sovereignty , which will happen before the @entity1 elections in 2016			0
we ’re talking about after the referendum of 2014 , giving that time for negotiation			0
' several countries including @entity41 have made clear it would block @entity1 ’s entry			0
but mr @entity0 said : ‘ the idea that oil - rich , fishing - rich , renewable energy - rich @entity1 will not be wanted as part of the @entity11 is simply incredible			1
’ he contrasted his enthusiasm for joining the @entity11 with @entity49 's move , in a speech this friday , to renegotiate powers back from @entity13			0
mr @entity0 ’s @entity52 has previously backed the idea of @entity1 joining the single currency , but today he ruled it out			1
‘ there ’s no prospect of them being members of the euro and currently and for the foreseeable future there ’s no prospect of @entity1 , an independent @entity1 , being a member of the euro , ' he told @entity65 's today programme			2
‘ what there is every prospect of is that oil - rich , fishing - rich , renewable energy - rich @entity1 will certainly be wanted in the @entity11 and it ’s also the case that a country which actually wants to be part of the @entity11 is more likely to end up as part of the @entity11			1
’ mps last night tonight agreed to hand the @entity17 the powers it needs to hold the referendum on independence			0
prime minister @entity49 and @entity1 first minister @entity0 agreed a deal to stage a referendum in autumn 2014 the government 's order , which hands power to @entity17 to hold the poll in the autumn of next year , now needs to be approved by the @entity85 today			1
the order was passed unopposed by mps as @entity1 secretary @entity88 told the @entity89 the ‘ great debate ’ about whether @entity1 could now separate from the rest of the @entity5 could begin			0
he said the legal order would give the @entity17 the legal , fair and decisive referendum pledged in the @entity94 and signed by mr @entity0 and mr @entity49 last year			0
mr @entity88 said : ‘ deciding @entity1 's future within the @entity5 will be the most important decision we as @entity1 take in our lifetime			0
‘ it is now essential the referendum decision is focused on determining whether @entity1 chooses to remain an integral part of the most successful partnership of nations the world has ever seen , to remain part of a family of nations that works in the interests of all - or whether @entity1 wishes to leave and go it alone			2

@entity1 first minister *rejects* the idea of independent nation having to join single currency
*boasts* that the @entity11 will want ' oil - rich , fishing - rich ' @entity1
@entity85 to sign of autumn 2014 independence referendum today
