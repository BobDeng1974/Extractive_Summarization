by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 last updated at 10:01 am on 7th march 2012 @entity3 is said to be so famous because she created an air of mystery by remaining silent			0
and @entity6 was fast re-creating a devoted army of fans based on enchanting looks alone			2
however , the sister of the @entity10 has finally spoken on camera after completing one of the toughest cross-country skiing events in the world yesterday			2
' i 'm average ' : @entity6 spoke to the cameras after completing a cross-country ski race beginner : cross-country novice @entity6 arrived in @entity21 a week ahead of the race to get in some practice the 28 - year - old – who had never done any cross-country skiing before – braved sub-zero temperatures during the 56 - mile challenge in @entity21			1
when she was quizzed over her efforts , @entity6 told the reporter she found the race ' tiring '			1
ms @entity6 , who engaged in a series of last - minute training sessions to brush up on her technique said she simply prepared ' over a couple of weekends '			2
a voice to match the face : @entity6 said she found the race ' tiring ' infectious smile : @entity6 still found time to flash her pearly whites after the gruelling seven hour race she also refused to rate herself out of 10 , saying she was an ' average ' skier			1
when she was asked what time she had planned to complete the race in , she rather sarcastically replied : ' to get round in time '			0
oops ! @entity6 takes a tumble as she gets to grips with the demanding sport nervous ? with no cross-country ski experience , @entity6 revealed she had been working on her general fitness at ease : a natural on skis , @entity6 soon picks up the cross-country technique arriving in @entity21 a week before the race , @entity6 and her brother @entity53 got kitted out with skis and poles and hit the snow to get to grips with the discipline			1
already a keen skier , @entity6 was at ease with the equipment - but nonetheless struggled to keep her balance on some of the course 's more challenging parts			1
she looked determined to master the art , spending her time ahead of the race practising the rhythmic swinging of the arms and smooth leg movements necessary for the kind of efficient and high - speed skiing style needed to earn her a decent place in the pecking order			0
envy : @entity6 with a local admirer after crossing the finish line raring to go : @entity6 arrives at the start of the @entity80 in @entity81 to raise money for charity the arduous training more than paid off in the end , as @entity6 managed to secure an impressive 412th place out of 15,800 racers when the race went ahead on the weekend			1
after the race , one local who hands the winner a wreath , proved the envy of many men when he planted a kiss on her cheek at the end of the course			0
@entity3 's younger sister joined 15,800 other skiers for the race between @entity81 and @entity102 , including her brother @entity53			1
but sweating it out on skis did not mean her exacting sartorial standards had to slip			0
helping hand : @entity108 , who was competing alongside @entity6 , zips up his sister at the start of race while she chats to a fellow racer @entity6 , wrote on her charity page : ' my brother and i are raising money for @entity117 , a small registered charity that fights child hunger through breakfast clubs ' miss @entity6 , who turned up with immaculate hair and make - up , started the race with a white hat but ended it in a fetching orange one , which she co-ordinated with her sunglasses and shoes			1
she crossed the finish line after seven hours , 13 minutes and 36 seconds – described by veterans as a ‘ very impressive ’ time			0
when asked if she minded finishing 26 minutes behind her brother , she replied : ‘ no , that was probably fair			0
’ despite being a beginner at cross country skiing , @entity6 marched powerfully along the tough course @entity6 was a natural on the course , onlookers said @entity6 joined 15,800 other skiiers for the gruelling race @entity6 was inundated with requests for interviews after completing the race the party planner explained she had ‘ never really skied cross-country before ’ , but said she and @entity53 , 23 , had done ‘ lots of fitness training ’ in the @entity140 to prepare for the race , as well as two weekends spent skiing in @entity144			1
during the race – much of which was uphill – miss @entity6 stopped to drink the local blabarsoppa , or blueberry soup , a drink handed out to racers which is said to boost energy			1
per @entity163 , a spokesman for the @entity158 race , one of the oldest events of its kind in the world , said : ‘ i must congratulate @entity6 – she had a fantastic performance			2
what she achieved was really impressive for a first timer			0
she was obviously very fit and in very good shape			0
’ the @entity170 were raising money for the @entity117 charity , which provides a pre-school meal to poor inner - city children in the @entity140			0
so far they have raised nearly £ 7,500 for the cause			0
up to the start line : @entity6 has a chat with a fellow racer before setting off on the challenge gaining speed : she proved to be an accomplished ski and looked at home on the slopes @entity6 stopped for a drink during the race and looked in good spirits when she took off again success ! @entity6 crossed the finish line in a ' very impressive ' time all for a good cause : the famous siblings were happy to pose for photos with fellow racers			2
