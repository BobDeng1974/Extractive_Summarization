by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 06:06 est , 10 october 2013 a centuries - old mummified head , pictured , once thought to have belonged to a 17th century king has been found to have no royal lineage at all after three years of tests , a centuries - old mummified head once thought to have belonged to a 17th century king has been found to have no royal lineage at all			1
@entity10 geneticist @entity9 compared dna from the embalmed head with three living relatives of the king and found a genetic mismatch , suggesting it ca n't be him			1
this discovery refutes claims made in 2010 by @entity20 researchers who used facial reconstruction to determine that the head was that of @entity23 @entity24 was credited with bringing religious peace to @entity20 and was responsible for building @entity27 landmarks such as the @entity29 bridge			1
he reigned from 1589 to may 1610 , when he was assassinated by a @entity31 fanatic			2
@entity24 was the first of the @entity34 monarchs and grandfather of @entity36			0
@entity9 , from the @entity37 , wrote in the @entity38 that it is ' impossible ' for the head to belong to the @entity20 king , but admitted he was not able to determine who it belonged to			1
the same study also found a blood sample previously attributed to @entity45 , one of @entity24 's descendants , lacked any royal ties as well			1
@entity45 died during the @entity48 and many spectators reportedly soaked their handkerchiefs in the king 's blood			1
however , @entity9 and colleagues found the lingering traces of powdered blood on the handkerchief they tested did not match the @entity34 family dna either			1
the left - hand image is taken from a painting of @entity23 from the @entity61			2
the right - hand image shows the facial reconstruction , carried out by @entity63 in 2010 , of the embalmed head			1
the similarities were used by the original researchers to determine that the head belonged to the king @entity24 was credited with bringing religious peace to @entity20 and was responsible for building @entity27 landmarks such as the @entity29 bridge			1
he reigned from 1589 to may 1610 , when he was assassinated by a @entity31 fanatic			2
@entity24 was the first of the @entity34 monarchs and grandfather of the @entity76			0
during the @entity20 revolution , the royal tombs at @entity78 near @entity27 were dug up and some accounts claim @entity24 's head was chopped off and stolen			1
yet @entity9 from the @entity37 disputes this , claiming @entity24 is still buried in @entity78 after the tombs were resealed in 1817			0
the dna from both the head and the handkerchief failed to match samples from other royal families on record			2
during the revolution , the royal tombs at @entity78 near @entity27 were dug up and some accounts claim @entity24 's head was chopped off and stolen			1
@entity9 and his co-authors dispute that @entity24 was decapitated and believe the king is still buried in @entity78 after the tombs were resealed in 1817			0
' that is impossible to verify , ' said @entity96 , a senior lecturer in @entity98 history at @entity99 , who was not connected to either study			0
he said there was n't much evidence one way or the other to suggest what happened to @entity24 's head , but added the king 's reputation as one of @entity20 's best kings might have saved his body from decapitation : ' if the revolutionaries were going to spare any of the kings , it would have been @entity23 ' @entity63 , author of the 2010 study that identified the head as @entity24 , dismissed the new research			1
he said he and his colleagues have found an exact match between a three - dimensional comparison of the ancient head and @entity24 's death mask and said the work will soon be published in a forensic journal			2
@entity63 added there were numerous doubts about the paternity of various kings in the @entity34 line , which might explain why there was no link between the dna of modern - day descendants and the ancient head			0
two years ago , analysis of dna taken by @entity63 , from traces of blood found inside a gourd where the handkerchief was kept revealed a likely match for someone of @entity45 's description , including his blue eyes			1
but it was never able to be proved beyond doubt as at the time the team did not have dna of any royal relation			0
@entity148 is a statue of the king showing a cut to his nose			0
the right image is an engraving of the king wearing an earring			0
these markings on the skull led the scientists to claim it belonged to the king in 2010			2
however , @entity9 's research claims dna evidence proves the head does n't have any royal lineage their research uncovered a rare genetic signature shared by two men separated by seven generations , and managed to provide evidence for the authenticity of both sets of remains in the process			1
@entity20 forensic pathologist @entity63 said : ' this study shows that ( the owners of the remains ) share a genetic heritage passed on through the paternal line			0
' @entity181 , of the @entity182 and the @entity184 project , agreed there could be questions about paternity in the @entity34 line and also raised concerns about the authenticity of the ancient dna samples , as he said it was very difficult to get good data from a sample several centuries old			0
' the best would be to look at ( @entity24 's ) heart as well , ' he said			0
' if you have multiple tissues from the same body showing the same results , that would be a positive identification			0
' @entity181 continued that given the lack of complete data , it was impossible to know for sure whom the head belonged to			2
@entity63 said the mummified head is currently in a @entity27 bank vault awaiting reburial but that there are no exact plans yet .			0

@entity23 of @entity20 was *killed* in 1610 by a @entity31 *protestor*
embalmed head , said to have belonged to the king , went missing in 1793
it was *rediscovered* in 1919 and in 2010 researchers claimed it was the king 's head after carrying out reconstructions
yet new dna evidence refutes this claim stating the head is n't even royal
handkerchief thought to be soaked with @entity45 's blood also found to have no royal ties
