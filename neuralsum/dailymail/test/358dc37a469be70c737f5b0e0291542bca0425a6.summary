@entity0 admits taking receipt of his first @entity2 league winners ’ medal would help finalise the process of feeling like a @entity6 player			1
for the young midfielder , a @entity8 title party next month would also help make up for the hurt he suffered at the very same venue 12 months previously			2
last may , at the culmination of an exciting season on @entity15 , @entity0 and his young @entity17 team - mates harboured high hopes of becoming just the third team in @entity21 history to lift the @entity22			1
@entity6 's @entity0 ( right ) is hoping to get his hands on the @entity2 title @entity0 completed a move from @entity17 to @entity6 during the january transfer window following a 2 - 0 defeat in the final against @entity30 , however , the 23 - year - old was left crestfallen as he watched the @entity32 side celebrate their own slice of history on the @entity8 turf			1
a year on and he is part of a @entity6 side rapidly closing in on a title that even @entity39 , manager of closest challengers @entity41 , admits is essentially over			1
while insisting nobody at @entity6 is taking league glory for granted , @entity0 – who joined @entity6 on transfer deadline day - admits that a title party in the east end of @entity47 next month would represent a green day to banish the blues that still hang over his head from a year ago			1
‘ last year ’s @entity54 at @entity8 was a disappointing end to a very enjoyable season , ’ @entity0 recalled ahead of his side 's lunchtime clash at @entity53			1
‘ we had the joy of winning the @entity22 semi-final against @entity60 at @entity61 so to then go on and lose in the final to @entity30 was very difficult to take			1
it ’s not something you can change , though , so you have to just live with that disappointment			0
‘ but winning the title would be nice this year			2
a bit of success would certainly lighten the disappointment of that cup final			2
‘ and there ’s a nice little gap building now at the top of the table			0
for a while @entity41 were threatening us closely but we have managed to extend the gap and we still have a game in hand			0
while it ’s never over until it ’s mathematically impossible , we are confident we can clinch it			0
but we wo n’t be complacent			0
@entity0 joined @entity6 along with his close friend and former @entity17 team - mate @entity80 ‘ i ’ve been here at @entity6 a few months now and i ’ve played a few games so i do feel like a @entity6 player			1
but i would feel even more like a @entity6 player with a league winners ’ medal			1
as a player , you want to fill your trophy cabinet up and winning the league title would be a great way to start			2
’ in this season when achieving just the fourth treble in @entity6 ’s long history is a real possibility , @entity0 , like close friend @entity80 , has been limited to @entity2 action because of his involvement in the cups with @entity17 earlier this season			1
his @entity101 - winning team - mates return to @entity102 next sunday to face @entity53 in the @entity22 semi finals and , while being on the outside for cup ties is undeniably frustrating , @entity0 believes arriving in january has been of huge benefit in other ways			1
in particular , he feels walking out to a wall of sound at @entity8 against @entity109 in the @entity110 in february will have left himself and @entity80 ready to hit the ground running in the @entity113 qualifiers in july			0
‘ it would be bizarre to maybe only be part of one part of a @entity117 - but it ’s also exciting to be part of a team who are capable of doing it , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’d have loved to have been involved in all the big matches but that ’s just the way it is			0
as it is , we have the chance of the title this year – and i ’m sure there will be chances for other medals next year			2
‘ but i definitely feel part of it at @entity6 now			1
myself and @entity80 have settled in really well			0
it was nice people were saying myself and @entity80 were worthy of being in contention for @entity139 but it was nice to get away to @entity141 for a few days of sun during the international break and to come back fresh			0
even if it felt wrong not having my friend @entity80 there in @entity141 with me , since we ’re always together ! @entity146 scored in @entity6 's recent @entity2 2 - 0 win over @entity148 ‘ but being in @entity141 to relax let me reflect on everything that ’s happened since january			1
yes , it ’s a little frustrating not to be involved in the cup matches because they are always exciting games			0
but the advantage of coming in january was that by the time the qualifiers come round next season i will look forward to them rather than be nervous			1
‘ the @entity109 game was an eye opener as to how big the support is and how noisy the ground can be			0
to play against a huge team like them – and for me to do so well – was a great experience and i ca n’t wait for next season			2
’ @entity53 - born @entity0 played for @entity53 for a season as a 16 - year - old before his family uprooted for @entity17 and he joined up at @entity21			1
while he has few ties left in the @entity166 , he is full of respect for @entity169 ’ side and his friend from the youth team , current @entity53 captain @entity172			2
‘ i grew up in @entity173 but i was born at @entity174 , ’ he said			0
‘ we lived up there for six or seven years when i was young and i ’ve still got family in @entity173			0
‘ i also played for @entity178 for a year before we moved to @entity179			0
the likes of @entity172 were there with the @entity181 and @entity182 was in charge , with @entity184 involved training the youth sides			0
‘ but i did n’t play particularly well at @entity53			0
i became a better player after i went to @entity17			2

@entity0 is hoping he can win his first @entity2 title
@entity0 joined @entity6 from @entity17 in january 2015
he experienced *heartache* during last season 's @entity22 final
@entity0 and his then @entity17 team - mates were beaten 2 - 0
