all three are in line for multi-million - pound payouts if the float , which is expected late this year or early in 2014 , succeeds			0
this is the first ever tweet sent by creator and co-founder @entity20 on march 21 , 2006 @entity5 co-founder @entity20 ( right with @entity46 mayor @entity45 ) has told @entity47 's ' 60 minutes ' that he wants to run for mayor in the future @entity50 , co-founder of @entity5 and his wife @entity51 , left , and @entity32 and his wife @entity52 , right , are to increase their wealth through the floatation the move is one of the most highly anticipated ipos in tech history with @entity5 the last of the major social networking sites to go public			1

it is thought that like @entity12 , @entity5 bosses ' hands were forced by the @entity119 which requires a @entity14 firm to file an ipo once it has reached 2,000 investors			1
although the ipo was filed confidentially - the law allows companies with less than $ 1billion revenue in its last financial year to do so - the company was quick to announce its intentions , naturally , with a tweet last night			1

@entity35 , 39 , and @entity32 , 41 , have also helped create @entity68 , @entity69 , and a host of other @entity183 ventures			0
@entity20 is currently thought to be worth around $ 1.1billion but the floatation could see that figure increase threefold			2
@entity35 's wealth could jump from $ 200million to $ 2billion , while @entity32 , thought to be the richest of the three , could see his personal fortune jump from $ 2billion to $ 8billion			1
