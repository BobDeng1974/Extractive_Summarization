@entity2 's once seedy @entity1 district is now nearly a faint memory as luxury apartments and developments have begun to take over the neighbourhood			1
gone are the days of sex shops , cabaret bars and a history of counterculture , as skyrocketing rent continues to soar			0
but one organisation is aiming to save @entity1 's ' gritty ' ambiance and celebrities including @entity15 and @entity16 have even signed up to the campaign			1
pictured : @entity21 's @entity20 actress @entity22 and comedian @entity23 have also joined the call to keep @entity1 inclusive , along with talk show host @entity25 and comedian @entity27			0
while once a hub for musicians , actors , the gay community , night owls and just about anyone else , many fear that @entity1 will soon be regenerated beyond recognition and so this campaign hopes to declare the entire region a ' heritage zone			0
' actor @entity15 , who has joined the ' @entity40 ' campaign , which was founded by @entity41 , has even gone so far as to declare that he does not want the scruffy @entity2 district to end up looking like ' @entity43 '			1
former bond girl @entity22 ( left ) and comedian @entity27 ( right ) have lent their support to the campaign to protect @entity1 's unique ambience and with a rich cultural and social history - cholera long ago ravaged the region , @entity49 began his movement here , @entity48 got her start in local nightclub @entity55 , and @entity57 were discovered in the area - such concern is warranted			2
' @entity1 has always changed , but the way it changed is by adding layer to layer , ' @entity41 told @entity63			2
' what happens at the moment is that some of these layers are ripped away to replace them with something new			0
' in response , musician @entity41 has founded the ' @entity40 ' campaign to halt rampant development other big name celebrities have also taken up the cause , such as @entity15 ( left ) and @entity16 ( right ) today , more music venues and sex clubs have closed than can be counted and with it , @entity1 's seedy , bohemian soul is slipping away			1
legendary performance club , madame @entity83 's , has been approved for demolition and one of the best live music venues , the @entity77 , where the likes of @entity79 and @entity80 played early shows , is likewise being forced to relocate			1
there is only one adult bookshop left on the former ' alleyway of sexual half - promises , ' also known as @entity20 , and @entity91 , the legendary music hub , is slowly being taken over by a newly - modernised @entity94 tube station			0
in a video recorded to raise awareness of the campaign , @entity15 says : ' @entity2 simply would n't be @entity2 without @entity1			2
' with iconic establishments like madame @entity83 's nightclub closing , the district is losing its gritty culture he describes how the area is a ' unique blend of raffishness with a hint of wickedness ' and adds : ' its bohemian character , its identity as the gay and transgender centre of @entity2 , its association with live performance and late - night eccentricity and free expression - all these are a gift beyond price that @entity1 gives @entity2 and which gives @entity2 extra value			1
the well - respected comedian signs off saying : ' this rush to gentrify to maximise profits and @entity2 would be the loser so please save @entity1			0
' the @entity77 , where @entity79 and @entity80 performed early gigs , is also being forced to relocate skyrocketing rents , along with the development of a new tube station has driven out local businesses @entity128 estimates that over 200,000 square metres of small commercial space has closed in @entity41 's quest to save @entity1 , his primary adversary is @entity133 , which has been the primary developer behind recent neighbourhood ' improvements			1
' the company , however , maintains that each development still ' recognises the rich and creativy history ' of the district			0
@entity128 , however , estimates that nearly 200,000 square metres of commercial space - and many small businesses - have been lost recently .			0
