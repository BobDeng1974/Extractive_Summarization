the former leader of @entity2 nationalists @entity3 has sparked fury after comparing @entity6 's nuclear deterrent to the @entity8 death camp at @entity9			1
lord @entity10 apologised for ' any offence caused ' after hitting out at claims the government could shift the @entity15 weapons system from @entity16 to @entity17			1
the peer dismissed the potential jobs boost for @entity17 , adding : ' look , this week we have been remembering what happened in @entity22 before the war , no doubt there were many jobs provided in @entity9 and places like that but that did n't justify their existence and neither does nuclear weapons justify having them in @entity32			1
' lord @entity10 defended comparing @entity6 's nuclear weapons to @entity8 death camps			1
he said : ' the number of people that will be killed by @entity15 will be infinitely more ' challenged as to why he was comparing a @entity15 base to the notorious death camp , he replied : ' the number of people that will be killed by @entity15 will be infinitely more			0
' in a statement released later , lord @entity10 said : ' i am certainly sorry if my remarks were open to any misinterpretation and i apologise for any offence that has been caused			1
' he added : ' the point i was trying to make was that you ca n't have jobs at any cost and i reiterate that			2
' former @entity2 secretary @entity49 branded lord @entity10 's comments ' crass ' , and said he was right to offer an apology - albeit a ' mealy - mouthed ' one			1
' his remarks were crass and defensive , and while the apology is a bit mealy - mouthed , at least it is good that he has acknowledged they are offensive , ' the @entity53 mp for @entity54 said			2
mr @entity49 said it was ' not appropriate at any time ' to use @entity9 to make political points			2
' nothing that ever happens in this country could ever be as appalling as what the @entity63 did , ' he added			0
' but to say it at holocaust memorial time is even worse			0
' a @entity67 , @entity68 , on patrol off the west coast of @entity16 on april 4 , 2013 survivors pass the main gate of the former @entity8 extermination camp @entity9 prior to a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of their liberation yesterday @entity10 is one of the biggest figures in @entity79 politics having led @entity3 for two stints totalling some 12 years			1
in 1974 he was among the first three mps the party secured at a general election , and held the seat for nearly three decades			0
he first became leader in 1981 , but resigned three years later when his twin sons became ill. after taking charge of @entity3 again in 1991 , mr @entity10 boosted its representation and played a major role in the referendum that established the @entity92			1
but in 2000 he stepped down as leader on medical advice , having suffered heart problems			0
he left @entity96 at the election the following year - when @entity3 recorded a 14.3 per cent vote share - and the @entity92 in 2003			2
in 2010 , at the age of 67 , the politician ended his hiatus from parliament , becoming @entity103			0
current leader @entity104 has appointed him as @entity3 's election co-ordinator for this may 's contest , where the party hopes to double its tally of three mps			2
lord @entity10 initially drew the comparison between @entity15 and a @entity8 death camp in an untaped conversation , before repeating them in an interview for the @entity115 and the @entity116			1
he said : ' the point i 'm making is that you have to look at what a job entails not just the fact that there is a job located in any particular area and , in this instance , we do not believe that we should have nuclear weapons at all , we believe that @entity15 should n't be renewed and we most certainly do n't want that renewal to happen in @entity32 or anywhere in @entity17 or , to be fair , anywhere in @entity6			1
pressed on whether he was suggesting there was a ' moral comparison ' between working on a @entity15 base and working at a @entity8 death camp , lord @entity10 said : ' no , the point i was making was this , that you have to consider the nature of the work and not just that a job exists			1
' the remarks by @entity103 , @entity3 's election co-ordinator , came after commemorations were held at @entity9 to mark 70 years since its liberation			1
some 300 survivors returned the the site in @entity146 - where around 1.1 million people were killed between 1940 and 1945			0
the @entity148 strongly opposes the renewal of @entity15 , but the @entity150 has dismissed reports that the @entity152 is making contingency plans for the weapons to be relocated from @entity16 to @entity17			1
prime minister @entity156 's spokesman said : ' there are no plans whatsoever			0
it is not on the table at all			0
' @entity16 first minister and @entity148 leader @entity162 distanced herself from lord @entity10 's comments			1
' it is not language i would use			0
it is not a comparison i would make , ' she said			0
@entity16 secretary @entity170 said the comments were ' offensive ' and trivialised the @entity172			2
' i visited @entity9 with a group of @entity16 school kids on a holocaust educational trip a few years ago and it 's only when you visit the place that you understand the sheer scale of the horrors that were perpetuated there , ' he said			1
' it 's offensive to our servicemen and servicewomen who work there ( at @entity186 ) - and that 's bad enough			0
but it really is offensive towards the people who suffered and died in @entity9			2
' it tells you a lot about the attitudes that you get from people whose judgment seems to go out of the window when a topic like this comes into play			0
it 's not a rational position			0
' the whole point is @entity9 's place in history is because of the people who died there and not the people that worked there			2
and if you trivialise that - and that is trivialising it - then you increase the chances that something like that could happen again			0
' there are some things that should n't be used in day - to - day politics and @entity172 memorial is one of them			0

lord @entity10 apologised for ' any offence caused ' after making ' crass ' claim
ex @entity3 leader *slammed* *proposal* to move weapons from @entity16
he said jobs boost for @entity17 did not make it right to move the weapons
the peer said : ' no doubt there were many jobs provided in @entity9 '
