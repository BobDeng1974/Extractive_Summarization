@entity1 's vacuums may have conquered living rooms up and down the country , but the inventor is hoping to expand his empire			1
the @entity7 - based designer is putting his efforts into designing a giant vacuum cleaner to be used on rivers			2
@entity1 envisions creating a device named the @entity13 barge , which uses the same cyclone technology as @entity1 vacuum cleaners			1
@entity1 envisions using a device he has named the @entity13 barge , which uses the same cyclone technology as @entity1 vacuum cleaners			1
the barge would trap plastic floating on the river 's surface the barge would trap plastic floating on the river 's surface using large nets , pick it up using a suction system and then separate it for processing			1
' by skimming a highly concentrated flow of larger sized plastics in polluted rivers , the @entity30 would effectively mine a major source of the pollution before it reached the sea , ' @entity1 told @entity37 at @entity38			2
' large skim nets unfurl from the rollers at its stern and are anchored on each side of the river			1
hydraulic winches wind them in and out			0
' the nets then face upstream and skim the surface of the river for floating debris			1
the barge design has large nets on its front - end that trap plastic floating on the surface of a river			1
a suction system then pulls in the waste , where the plastic is separated , shredded and then sent for processing @entity1 explains that the plastic waste is shredded on board , and different grades of plastic are separated by a huge cyclone			1
the idea was sketched out for @entity64 , and @entity1 said he originally wanted the machine to be fixed at different points along a river			2
he claims that the amount of plastic debris in the oceans has grown a hundredfold in the past 40 years , and that much of this is n't biodegradable			1
as well as the increased waste , in the past 30 years , plastic production has increased by a 500 per cent			2
the entrepreneur believes plastic it in rivers before it heads to the ocean may be a solution to cleaning up the planet			0
the @entity13 barge has not yet been prototyped or tested , but @entity1 said he is convinced it can work			2
@entity84 , a @entity85 merchant marine captain said he is ' utterly shocked ' at the massive increase in plastic litter plastic			0
it 's one of the most pernicious threats to the future of our planet			0
we all use it - it 's part of our daily lives and has been for 50 years or more			0
although plastic seems innocuous enough , your discarded coffee cup or plastic bag may be slowly killing life in the world 's oceans - and , in the process , threatening our own existence on @entity106			2
in a disturbing report , one of the world 's leading experts sounds an urgent alarm on the state of our oceans			0
@entity84 , a @entity85 merchant marine captain and founder of the @entity115 in @entity116 , @entity117 , says he is ' utterly shocked ' at the massive increase in plastic litter found floating on the sea 's surface in the past five years			1
he suggests it is a greater threat than climate change , adding : ' it 's choking our future in ways that most of us are barely aware			0
' in the past 30 years , plastic production has increased by an astonishing 500 per cent			0
once it was a by - product of petrochemical refining			0
now it has become an integral element in human existence			0
captain @entity84 and his team estimated that , in just three days ' sampling , 2.3 billion pieces of plastic - from polystyrene foam to tiny pellets - had flowed from the urban centres of @entity117 into its coastal waters			0

@entity1 has designed a device named the @entity144
it is based on same cyclone technology as @entity1 vacuum cleaners
it would trap plastic floating on the river 's surface using large nets
suction would pick up plastic which would be processed on board
plastic debris in the oceans has grown one hundredfold in 40 years
