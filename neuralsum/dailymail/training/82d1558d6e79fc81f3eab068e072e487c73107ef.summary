by @entity1 reporter published : 11:57 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 13:30 est , 27 december 2012 a nine - year - old boy who is dying from cystic fibrosis has been sent hundreds of thousands of @entity5 cards in his bid to set the world record for the most ever received			1
for the past month , @entity8 has been getting cards from strangers from all over the world bearing the same wish - that he sets the @entity14 world record before he succumbs to the disease			1
so far , the youngster from @entity18 , @entity16 has received 504,269 cards , far exceeding the 205,120 cards received in 1992 - the last official time @entity14 noted a @entity5 card category			1
still , the family is encouraging the cards to keep coming , in the hope that @entity35 will re-open the category for his feat. cards stacked in the family 's garage and swamping the home have come from as far afield as @entity42 , the @entity43 and @entity44 in what his mother @entity45 calls ' a @entity5 miracle '			1
the first few trickled in after a family friend wrote a post on @entity52 asking for messages of support that @entity55 could place on the mantlepiece for her sick son			1
plea : it originally started after a family friend posted on @entity52 asking for cards bearing warm wishes that his parents , @entity45 and @entity64 , pictured , could put up in the home - and the message went viral generosity : the youngster has received more than half a million cards , which no longer fit in his family home loved : @entity72 brought him 30,000 on @entity74 alone			1
volunteers handpick ones for him to read but as cards started coming in from neighbours and friends , the @entity52 message began spreading across the social network and was picked up by local media			1
with this boost came thousands more cards , including stacks hand - delivered by @entity16 and @entity86			2
on christmas eve alone , the postal service delivered 30,000 letters and 1,972 packages , some of which were crammed full with cards , @entity93 , from the @entity94 , told @entity30			0
in addition to these , services such as @entity72 and @entity96 delivered hundreds more			0
there are so many that the cards can longer fit in the family 's home and the postal service can no longer fit them all into a truck			2
show of support : a stack of the cards was hand - delivered to @entity8 by @entity16 state troopers battle : @entity8 relies on a mask to help him breathe			1
doctors said he had just days to live in october , but his mother said the cards have helped him become like he was before the illness really took hold , right instead , in another show of goodwill , a local television reporter has started filling a trailer to bring all the cards to @entity8 's grandfather 's church			2
there , dozens of volunteers have been sifting through the thousands of letters , opening each one and saving special ones to take @entity8 to read himself			2
' one little girl said she wished he was her boyfriend , ' volunteer @entity129 said			0
' the big majority of the town has sent cards or is helping out			0
everyone just wants to do what we can			0
' the youngster has stage four cystic fibrosis , which makes it near impossible to breathe			1
he takes 18 different medicines each day and wears a face mask to help him breath			0
in october , doctors gave him just two to eight days to live , @entity55 said			0
outpouring : the number of cards he has received has easily overtaken the last record in 1992 of 205,120 but ' he 's doing pretty good now , ' she said			2
' it 's just been the best @entity5 ever			0
he 's excited for the first time in a long time			0
he 's laughing more , he 's beginning to become how he was two years ago			0
' i think just knowing people really do care for him , that the cards let him know people love him , it has all helped			0
' there is no time limit on when @entity8 can stop receiving the cards , the @entity14 spokesperson said			1
want to send a @entity5 card to @entity8 ? address it to : @entity163 62 box 1249 @entity18 , @entity164 41465 .			2

@entity8 , who has cystic fibrosis , began receiving cards when friend put plea on @entity52 and has now had cards from all over the world
last record was 205,120 set in 1992 - but @entity14 world records said it is no longer monitoring the category
family hopes @entity14 will re-open the category to recognize his feat
