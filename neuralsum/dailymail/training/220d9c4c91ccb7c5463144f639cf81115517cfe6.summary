the 40 - year - old @entity7 guard owes his life to his cell after he used it as a last ditch attempt to scare of a raging polar bear			1
lucky escape : @entity13 , 40 , was trapped in a door way by a raging bear biting and scratching him new to @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , mr @entity4 was not aware of its sizable polar bear population			1

on his way home from after - work drinks last friday , mr @entity4 , from @entity32 , would be made well aware			1
as he made his way through the main town in the early hours of saturday morning , a 28 - stone animal appeared out of nowhere			1
hearing a muffled noise , the worker looked over his shoulder to see the creature charging towards him			0
screaming , running , and shielding his face , mr @entity4 was not quick enough			1
the bear sunk its teeth into his hip , wildly hitting and scratching			1
in a desperate bid to get away , he flashed the screen of his mobile phone			1

but the door was locked			0

with a similar iq to apes , polar bears are ranked as some of the planet 's most intelligent creatures			1

i turned it towards the bear , put it in his face			2
' it was a move that would save his life			0

so when it did , i just ran			0
' he scarpered towards a group of people sitting on a deck			0
but , turning around , the bear was nowhere to be seen			2
exhausted , he got a taxi to the health centre , where staff treated two bite wounds on his leg and hip			2

@entity4 , 40 , was walking home from after - work drinks at *1.30am* when the animal charged
the @entity142 guard from @entity32 did not know @entity17 , @entity65 , was the polar bear capital of the world
he could not run fast enough so *grabbed* his phone from his pocket
the 28 - stone bear had already bitten his hip and scratched his chest
