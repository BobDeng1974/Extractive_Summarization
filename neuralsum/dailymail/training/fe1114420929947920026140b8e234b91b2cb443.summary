by @entity0 published : 09:48 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 13:03 est , 27 october 2013 @entity1 , 12 , was banned from wearing her leopard skin coat by @entity3 , @entity4 a father pulled his two daughters out of school after one was told she was n't allowed to wear a leopard print coat			1
@entity10 , 35 , bought the jacket so his daughter , @entity1 , would be easily seen by cars as she walked home on dark evenings			1
but the 12 - year - old was told off when she arrived at @entity3 , in @entity4 , and was warned she could only return in black or grey clothes			1
the father - of - two immediately withdrew @entity1 and her 15 - year - old sister , @entity19 , from the school which is rated as satisfactory by @entity21			1
mr @entity10 said : ' my daughter has got a leopard print coat that keeps her dry and warm			1
' the school want all the pupils to have a dark coloured coat , but when children are walking home from school in the dark , it would be better for them to wear more visible clothing			2
' @entity1 's coat is n't brightly coloured , it just makes her easier for drivers to spot in the evenings			0
it 's just the same as any other coat - it 's just that it 's leopard print			2
' what 's the difference ? it 's not offensive			0
' the school , which caters for 620 pupils aged between 11 and 16 , claims the coat ' did not conform ' to it 's ' strict dress code '			0
principal @entity47 insists its uniform rules are an important aspect of school life , adding : ' the code is agreed by the @entity53 of the school			0
@entity10 banned his daughters @entity19 , 15 , and @entity1 , 12 , ( pictured with their mother @entity56 ) from school after the latter was told she could n't wear the coat ' all parents and students were informed of the code in the summer			1
was father right to pull both daughters out of school after one was banned from wearing leopard print coat ? ' @entity3 students wear their uniform with pride and it is integral to the strong work ethic and successful ethos of the school			2
' mr @entity10 was informed recently that a coat worn to school was inappropriate			2
this is because it did not conform to the school dress code			0
' after a meeting arranged to hear his concerns and to make the school 's position clear mr @entity10 removed both of his children from the school of his own volition			2
' his children have not been excluded from school or informally asked to stay away			0
neither would be an appropriate response			0
@entity1 was told she must return to school in black or grey clothes which are in keeping with school rules @entity3 in @entity4 said the coat was ' inappropriate ' and ' did not conform to the school 's strict dress code ' ' we would hope that mr @entity10 will decide to send his children back to a highly successful school			1
' after discussing the matter last week mr @entity10 agreed to return older daughter @entity19 to school ahead of her gcses , but not until after half term			1
he added : ' i 'm still trying to find somewhere else for @entity1 to go			0
' @entity19 is going back after half term - we do n't want to move her at the moment because she 's in the middle of her gcses			0

@entity10 bought his 12 - year - old daughter the coat so she would be noticed by cars in the dark
@entity3 in @entity4 told *schoolgirl* to return in darker clothes
his *eldest* daughter , 15 , will return to the school ahead of her gsce 's
