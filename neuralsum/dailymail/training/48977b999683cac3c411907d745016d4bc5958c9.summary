a @entity1 student was left in disbelief after buying a packet of @entity6 cheese and onion rolls to find it contained a pork sausage roll			1
@entity9 , 20 , bought the £ 2 pack of 10 ‘ @entity11 ’ branded rolls from the superstore in @entity14 , @entity15			1
she quickly spotted the single meat - filled pastry after putting it in the microwave to cook it and realised the filling was the wrong colour			1
the packet of cheese and onion sausage rolls that @entity9 bought from the @entity6 store in @entity14 ms @entity9 , who is studying optometry at the @entity27 , said : ‘ this is not acceptable			1
i do n’t eat sausage rolls and what about vegetarians too ? it was really shocking			2
’ ‘ i warmed it up in the microwave and i knew that something was wrong			1
meat has that texture and i knew it was meat when i looked at it			2
‘ i got the knife and fork and started to investigate			0
i disinfected the plate after it and i do n’t know what i would have done if i had eaten it			2
’ she added that her mother was upset because she worried she would have eaten it			1
staff from the supermarket have apologised and are carrying out a detailed investigation after they were unable to understand how it happened			1
@entity6 said only cheese and onion rolls had been processed on that particular production run , and the one previous to that – and there had been no other complaints			1
ms @entity9 continued : ‘ i always buy vegetarian food in the supermarket because it is better to be safe			1
‘ but my mum is scared to buy anything vegetarian from the supermarket now			2
’ her mother , @entity65 , 49 , said : ‘ vegetarian labelled packaging should contain vegetarian food			0
i ’m concerned that other people could have eaten one by mistake			2
the @entity1 student spotted the sausage roll ( above ) amongst the other pastries in the packet before she ate it ‘ some people just nibble at their food and they would n’t know that is was meat until it was too late			1
‘ if it was n’t meat it could have been a nut and that could have been dangerous for someone with an allergy			0
people need to know what is going in their food and need to be able to trust it			0
’ the student has now launched an online campaign against @entity6 warning people who trust vegetarian labelling to double check their food before they eat it			1
she said : ‘ what upset me the most is that it takes 40 days to process the complaint and that is not even investigating it			0
‘ @entity6 did n’t give me a complaint reference number and they have n’t made any effort with me			0
i ’ve not heard anything back since i made the complaint on thursday morning			0
’ the packet was sold to ms @entity9 at the @entity102 in @entity14 , @entity15 ( above ) last week ms @entity9 claims staff were not willing to remove the batch from the shelf			1
she continued : ‘ they were n’t budging when i complained and all they cared about was taking the sausage roll off me			0
it ’s in my freezer now			0
head office tried to offer me a refund but i want the food to be checked properly			0
there ’s something wrong with the production line			2
‘ i would n’t shop at @entity6 again and i have told them that			0
i ’m definitely taking legal action and going forward with this			0
quality control should have checked it			0
’ a spokesman for @entity6 said : ‘ we ’re at a loss to understand how this happened and are confident this is an isolated incident			0
‘ we ’re sorry for any upset caused to ms @entity9 , and we ’ll be in touch with her shortly with the details of our full investigation			1
