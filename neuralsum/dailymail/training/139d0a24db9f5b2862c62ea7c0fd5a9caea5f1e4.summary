it was awful to see			0

' it was quite miraculous that no one else sustained a life threatening injury			0
what occurred will remain with all the family for the rest of your lives ' @entity220 , senior coroner ‘ i was travelling at 70mph and she must have been doing 15mph more than me			0
the mini was just 6ft in front of me when it spun across into my land before continuing to do a 360 - degree turn toward the hard shoulder			1
’ passing motorist and break - down recovery driver @entity156 said : ‘ i ran up to the car and could see a baby looking at me from the back seat			1

my heart was ten to the dozen and it was such a relief to hear emergency services coming			0

‘ the tyres were significantly 36 per cent deflated and in the circumstances it is possible that as @entity2 managed the left hand corner she under steered			1
' together with her studies , effectively @entity2 had mapped out her future with her son and the heart of it ' @entity68 , @entity2 's mother ‘ a combination of an excess of the speed limit and maintenance of the car and a lack of motorway driving experience may have led to this tragic accident			1
’ senior coroner @entity220 recorded her death as a road traffic collision and told mrs @entity2 : ‘ i mentioned how miraculous , as i think that is the only word for it , that your grandson came out of this completely unscathed			1
‘ i hope when he is old enough to understand you will tell him about his mother who sadly is no longer here to care for him			2
as she passed her driving test she would have means to be a free spirit			0
‘ she was able to travel			0
i appreciate that weekend was devoted to her son			0
i do not perceive this is a scenario of someone being late for an appointment and taking risks to make up time			0
‘ i put her speeding simply down to a lack of experience			0
i can not ignore the fact that speed was a significant factor in this incident			0
it was quite miraculous that no one else sustained a life threatening injury			0

she strikes me as a very determined individual			0
