by @entity0 last updated at 10:02 am on 12th december 2011 it is the dilemma faced by thousands of shoppers when searching for a new gadget for the home			1
whether buying a camcorder or coffee maker , a dvd player or dishwasher , is it a good idea to plump for the most expensive brand , stick with the names you trust , or take a chance on the cheapest model and hope for the best ? the average price of a festive basket of food and drink is a hefty 19.5per cent higher than last @entity20			1
@entity21 came out best value for a trolley of 33 festive essentials , which totted up to £ 127.40 - £ 4.32 less than second - placed @entity25 , £ 9.85 less than biggest chain @entity26 , £ 21.60 less than @entity27 's and a whopping £ 40.04 less than upmarket @entity28			1
@entity21 also had the cheapest offers on festive drinks though , @entity25 has the cheapest small turkey at £ 8.33 , compared with @entity21 at £ 10 , @entity27 's for £ 13.24 and @entity26 £ 15.00 while at @entity28 they were £ 17.01			2
but the basket compiled annually by trade magazine @entity33 , while not strictly comparing like with like , cost on average £ 142.36 this year , a staggering 19.5per cent hike on last year 's average across the five major chains of £ 119.18			2
however the cost of alcohol was down , along with the @entity40 for the cost festive hangover			2
@entity21 was selling champagne for £ 12 a bottle , merlot for £ 4 and sauvignon blanc for £ 6 , @entity47 for £ 10 and @entity48 for £ 6.32			2
own - label @entity20 puddings were just £ 5 at @entity21 , matched only by @entity26 , and along with @entity27 's the cheapest mince pies at £ 1			1
but now there ’s no excuse to be baffled as the country ’s consumer experts have produced a list of the 50 best buys of the year			0
the top household products have been compiled by which ? magazine after researchers tested 2,700 makes and models under strict laboratory conditions			0
which ? says everything from headphones , laser printers , vacuum cleaners and baby monitors were put through their paces before they could be deemed a best buy			0
the list is based on the goods being the most efficient , the best value for money , the least likely to go wrong , and the most likely to do the job properly			0
for customers looking to replace a broken - down washing machine or buy a present for a loved one , it could take the guesswork out of the dazzling array of items on the shelves			1
the winners range from a 55in @entity90 television priced at £ 2,500 to a pack of @entity93 rechargeable batteries worth £ 8			0
the best toaster costs just £ 28 , compared with some models on sale for twice as much			0
in contrast , the top tumble dryer , from @entity99 manufacturer @entity98 , costs £ 1,269 , which is considerably more expensive than rival machines			0
most brand names on the list , including @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , are well known to @entity108 consumers , while those such as @entity109 , the @entity111 - based coffee machine maker , are less so			1
the list may prompt householders to check which makes and models they own themselves , or perhaps act as a reminder about what they should get next time			0
but be warned : buying the best does n’t come cheap.purchasing every item on the list contained in the panel would cost almost £ 19,500			0
some categories , such as fridge - freezers , were omitted from the list because no particular model was deemed a best buy			1
‘ they either did n’t make the grade , or lacked sufficient reliability data , ’ said a which ? spokesman			0
meanwhile , cyber monday last week saw @entity133 receive orders for over three million items , which is the most amount of items ever to be ordered in a single day			1
the £ 89 @entity138 was the best selling product of the day .			1
