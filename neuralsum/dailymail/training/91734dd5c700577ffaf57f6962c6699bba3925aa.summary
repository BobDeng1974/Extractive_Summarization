@entity0 could become a ‘ second - class ’ member of the @entity2 under plans floated in @entity5 yesterday			1
an influential group of @entity8 federalists , who want to see @entity5 given even greater powers , is suggesting the @entity0 is relegated to ‘ associate member ’ status			1
the move would see @entity0 remain part of the single market but freed from much of the social legislation and bureaucracy associated with full @entity2 membership			2
@entity18 is due to give a major speech on @entity0 's membership of the @entity2 within weeks however the @entity0 would lose its veto on @entity2 policy and would no longer have an @entity2 commissioner or @entity0 representation in the @entity25			1
@entity26 was cool on the idea yesterday , saying that although @entity18 wanted a new relationship with the @entity2 , based on membership of the single market , he was wary of adopting the same position as @entity33 – which although not a full @entity2 member , as a major trading partner is obliged to adopt many of its regulations			2
former @entity40 president @entity39 has backed the idea of @entity0 becoming a ' partner ' of the @entity2 critics condemn the position as being ‘ ruled by fax ’ from @entity5			0
but some @entity46 welcomed the suggestion , arguing that it was the first sign that federalist politicians were starting to take seriously the debate in the @entity0 over the ever - increasing loss of sovereignty to @entity5			0
former @entity54 cabinet minister @entity53 hailed the idea as ‘ great news ’ , adding : ‘ it shows that the @entity0 can negotiate a new relationship with them			0
' it shows that many on the continent now recognise that the @entity0 can not join their euro union and needs a looser relationship with them based on trade			0
’ but fellow @entity54 @entity66 said the proposal did not go far enough			0
‘ the @entity0 should be free to trade with @entity8 but not shackled by the strictures and regulations of the single market , ’ he said			1
the @entity71 is expected to set out its plan for @entity0 in a draft @entity2 treaty in the spring			0
@entity0 @entity76 mep @entity75 , who heads the group , said the proposal would create a new category of membership to ensure @entity0 did not leave altogether			1
‘ if @entity18 proposes a catalogue of opt - outs , derogations , red lines and rebates for @entity0 to pick and choose , then he will strengthen the argument for the creation of a formal association for the @entity0 , ’ he said			2
‘ the priority on the @entity62 is to create a federal system which works , and @entity0 is seen at present as a continual impediment			1

federalists suggest creating ' associate member ' status for @entity0
