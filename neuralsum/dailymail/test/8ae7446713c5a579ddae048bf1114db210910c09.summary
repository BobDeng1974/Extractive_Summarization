while travelling the world can cost a lot of money , there are some ways to do it for free , or at leas ton a very tight budget stay in a stranger ’s house @entity36 - sitting is one of the easiest ways to trim costs on a trip abroad because it eliminates the need to spend a huge amount of money on accommodation			1
