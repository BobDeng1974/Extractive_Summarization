a member of the public shouted ' shameful ' as professor @entity13 , chairman of the @entity14 , said sir @entity7 was the person ' we wish very strongly ' to lead the organisation			1
sir @entity7 has faced calls to quit following the publication of the @entity20 into serious failings at @entity22 between 2005 and 2009			1
anger : health campaigners stormed out of a meeting of @entity5 bosses today as under fire chief executive sir @entity7 was given a vote of confidence by his board the stormy meeting came after it emerged today that the @entity22 may be placed into administration by health bosses			1
regulator monitor said it was considering the move in order to ' safeguard services ' for local patients			0
if the move goes ahead , the trust will be the first foundation trust in the country to be put under the charge of special administrators			1
the families of patients caught up in the @entity20 staged a protest outside the meeting of @entity5 bosses today and renewed their calls for the resignation of sir @entity7			1
the campaigners stood in silence outside the meeting in @entity51 of the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , which sir @entity7 heads			1
around a dozen people , who had travelled from @entity53 , held placards displaying sir @entity7 ’s photograph accompanied by the words ' resign ' , ' the man with no shame ' and ' too many deaths , no accountability '			1
leading the protest outside was @entity63 , who set up the organisation cure the @entity5 after her mother , @entity65 , died at @entity66 in 2007			1
pressure : the silent protest was held outside @entity5 offices in @entity51 against sir @entity7 speaking outside the meeting , mrs @entity63 said the families ' simply want a safer @entity5 '			1
she added : ' we campaigned for three years for a public inquiry in the hope that at the end of it we would get accountability and justice for all the loved ones that we have lost			0
' we want accountability and safety for everyone in the @entity5 and we believe that wo n’t happen until people are held to account			2
' she said sir @entity7 was ' not a scapegoat ' , adding : ' he is the chief executive of the @entity5 and holds ultimate responsibility for the failings			1
' he is paid an awful amount of money to ensure people are safe in hospital			0
it ’s not a difficult thing to do but he seems to have taken the eye off safety and prioritised finances instead			0
' we believe that , as he is ultimately responsible for the @entity5 , he should do the honourable thing and resign immediately			2
' it ’s disappointing that we ’re having to be here , after all this time , trying to hold people to account and get justice			0
' she said her message to the @entity5 board today was : ' how can we start to cure the @entity5 when the person who was in charge of those failings is now expected to be in charge of putting it right ? ' but speaking at the meeting , sir @entity7 defended his position			1
he said : ' the enemy is complacency that things will be all right in the face of criticism of @entity5 services			2
' what we need to do is absorb the criticism , understand it in a deep way and do something about it			0
' i 'm very passionate about improving services for patients , i 'm very ambitious about the @entity5 and what that sometimes turns into is intolerance of poor performance which results in the kind of response " just get it right " when actually we need to be more reflective , think about why people are doing the things they do			2
' he said it was important that standards are set in a way patients can understand and help enforce			0
' if we had hundreds of thousands of inspectors going round hospitals looking at that , we would n't pick up all the poor care that happens			0
' patient safety is the top of the tree			0
we need zero tolerance of failures of patient safety			0
' at the meeting , prof @entity13 said he had been ' deeply worried ' by speculation in the media about sir @entity7 's future			1
controversy : sir @entity7 has faced calls to quit following the publication of the @entity20 into serious failings at @entity22 between 2005 and 2009 he added : ' over the recent weeks i have reflected on several occasions with @entity7 about what has been said in the press			1
' i have discussed it personally with each of the directors of the @entity14 and i have discussed it collectively with the non-executive directors of the board			2
' we have come to a clear view that @entity7 is the chief executive of the board , he is the person who we wish very strongly to lead a strong executive team on the board			1
' he is the person whose command of the detail of the @entity5 , and his commitment and his passion to its future , we believe to be fundamental to the success of the board			1
' the chairman said his statement was a ' statement of strength ' and added : ' we look , @entity7 , to you to provide us with the leadership as we take through an exceptionally challenging set of changes			2
' @entity187 , of the campaign group cure the @entity5 , was one of those who walked out of the meeting			2
speaking afterwards , he said : ' it 's outrageous for him ( sir @entity7 ) to say he needed to go on running this when he has been responsible for all that has happened			1
' he was in charge of the strategic health authority when all this was going on			0
' the @entity5 trust at the centre of the @entity20 could become the first foundation trust in the country to be put into administration , it emerged today			1
regulator monitor said it was considering the move in order to ' safeguard services ' for local patients last year , @entity209 ( @entity210 ) became the first ever @entity5 trust to be put into administration after it started losing around £ 1.3 million a week			1
worrying : the @entity5 trust at the centre of the @entity20 could become the first foundation trust in the country to be put into administration			1
@entity215 is pictured but now @entity22 could be the first foundation trust - a supposed marker of excellence in the health service - to face the same fate			1
monitor , the watchdog which regulates foundation trusts , said it was consulting the health secretary and key organisations about the prospective appointment of trust special administrators			1
an independent review into the trust , conducted on behalf of @entity221 , concluded that the organisation was neither clinically nor financially sustainable in its current form			0
@entity221 said that if administrators are appointed , they will devise a plan for the reorganisation and delivery of services			0
a spokesman said the plan would be subject to public consultation			0
@entity240 , chief executive of @entity221 , said : ' we are now consulting on whether to appoint trust special administrators with the expertise to reorganise services in a way which is clinically robust and sustainable			2
campaigner : @entity63 , founder of ' cure the @entity5 ' campaign , was leading the protest outside ' their priority will be to make sure that patients can continue to access the services that they need and they will work with the local community to do this			2
' taking into account the consultation process , it would be several weeks before trust special administrators were in place			2
in the meantime , the trust board will continue to ensure the current range of services are delivered for patients and trust special administrators would then continue that responsibility			2
' yesterday it was revealed that death rates at another hospital are being investigated following the discovery that an ' unusually high number ' of deaths were ' coded ' as due to septicaemia			0
@entity275 ’s acting chief executive , dr @entity274 , has stepped aside pending the inquiry			0
@entity277 , a severe infection which enters the bloodstream , is coded , or tagged , in a different way from other illnesses and infections , which means deaths caused by septicaemia do not affect hospital mortality figures			0
in the wake of the findings , @entity5 medical director professor sir @entity286 called on all hospitals to ' behave openly and honestly about their performance ' and said they would be ' monitoring the situation '			2
according to a report in the @entity296 , the trust recorded 800 cases of septicaemia between march 2011 and april 2012 - a similar sized trust would expect to have just 200			0
dr @entity274 , as former medical director , was in charge of recording the information			0
the independent watchdog which is auditing the data is understood to be investigating 200 cases , the @entity296 reported			0
its interim findings for 50 of the cases show ' cause for concern '			0
in a statement , the trust said : ' while this work is taking place , dr @entity274 , who as a trust consultant and medical director oversaw coding , has agreed to step aside as acting chief executive , to allow a fully independent view to be taken			0
' we do not believe that there are any clinical concerns regarding the care of patients , but rather there are questions that need answering about how the trust reports information about their care for administrative and financial purposes			0

@entity14 said sir @entity7 was the person ' we wish very strongly ' to lead the @entity5
he has faced calls to quit following @entity66 scandal
protestors staged silent protest and told of ' disgust ' at *decision*
@entity22 may be placed into administration
it would be first foundation trust to be put under charge of administrators
