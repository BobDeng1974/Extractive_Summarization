former @entity1 mayor @entity0 on thursday castigated president @entity2 for setting a ' tone ' that inspires violent behavior in @entity6 and advocated for him to emulate @entity7 when it comes to talking about black crime			1
he also told radio host @entity10 during an interview on am 970 the answer that @entity2 is ignoring ' enormous amounts of crime ' being committed by blacks			2
roughly ' 70 percent ' of homicides in @entity1 are committed by @entity18 , @entity0 said			2
' there are many , many extremely understandable ' reasons for that both historically and environmentally , he added			0
' and if an @entity18 - @entity18 president stood up and said - i hate to mention it because of what happened afterwards - the kinds of stuff that @entity7 used to say			1
the kinds of stuff that @entity29 says at the @entity30 : this is our responsibility , ' he said , trailing off into an explanation of @entity29 's doctrine			0
fresh off his trip abroad , @entity0 contended on thursday that internationally , @entity6 is considered a ' racist state ' imam @entity46 is a black , @entity47 leader in @entity1 who @entity0 has been friends with more than a decade			1
i remember @entity29 saying to his congregation , if there were less crime in the community , there would be less police in our community , @entity0 recalled			1
when referencing @entity7 , the retired @entity1 politician was referring to allegations that surfaced last year that black actor raped or otherwise sexually assaulted number of former cast - mates and other women throughout the ' 60s , 70s and 80s			2
prior to that ' @entity63 ' had earned a reputation for forcefully encouraging @entity18 teens to clean up their act and make better use of the educational system their ancestors fought to earn access to			0
in on memorable - and controversial - address @entity7 touched on the perils of stealing and defended police against charges of racism			1
now known as ' the @entity76 ' , @entity7 said , ' these are people going around stealing @entity78			2
people getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake			0
' then we all run out and are outraged : " the cops should n’t have shot him			0
" what the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand ? ' @entity7 asked			0
' i wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as anybody else			0
and i looked at it and i had no money			0
and something called parenting said , " if you get caught with it , you ’re going to embarrass your mother			0
” ' ' @entity6 's mayor ' has made a few contentious statements of his own as of late , saying late last month he 's not sure , based on the president 's upbringing and behavior , that @entity2 ' loves @entity6			1
' after several days of spinning , and counter claims that he had racist intent when the made the derogatory remarks about the nation 's first black president , @entity0 finally ended the media - frenzy by penning an op - ed in which he explained that he simply wishes the president would speak more highly of @entity18 exceptionalism			1
striving to avoid another kerfuffle , @entity0 was careful to balance out his criticisms of @entity2 on @entity120 with a note of goodwill to the president			1
' i disagree with @entity2 on almost everything , but i think @entity2 's a good family man , and he 's a good man			1
' ' this is the model we need , ' he said of the positive example @entity2 is setting for the @entity18 communities as a father and a husband			0
earlier in the interview , @entity0 suggested the savage beating of a 15 - year - old girl in a @entity148 's on monday , the shooting of two @entity135 police officers this morning and an incident at a city council meeting involving @entity139 commissioner @entity138 , at which 20 protester heckled him until they were led out by the cops , all occurred because @entity2 had n't done more to verbally build up @entity6 's police			1
' it all starts at the top			0
it ’s the tone that ’s set by the president , ' @entity0 said on radio station am 970 the answer			0
president @entity2 , pictured here boarding @entity156 today , should seek to emulate @entity7 when it comes to talking about crimes committed by blacks , @entity0 contended , prefacing the statement with his loathe to mention @entity7 ' because of what happened afterwards ' @entity0 , who just returned stateside following a conference in @entity43 on ' @entity163 against @entity164 and @entity165 and says he spent a large portion of the fall traveling abroad , contended that internationally , @entity6 's police are considered to be ' racist			1
' ' it is the obligation of the president to explain , ' to @entity18 and the global community ' that our police are the best in the world , ' he said			0
they are the best trained and better restrained than police forces in other countries and fire their guns less often , @entity0 argued			2
' there are very few incidents that turn out to be bad incidents , ' the 2008 presidential candidate said in audio of the interview provided to @entity186 by the radio station			0
' and the one they tried to make out into a bad incident , @entity135 , where they all went crazy , was a man who was shot in the commission of a crime			2
' and it turned out to be a justifiable homicide , ' @entity0 said of the shooting of @entity198 , citing both the state grand jury 's decision not to indite police officer @entity202 and the @entity204 's announcement that it would n't bring charges against him , either			1
one person @entity2 should not be listening to or promoting @entity0 said is rev. @entity207 , who is not respected by @entity6 's police of all race			1
@entity0 said the sentiment among police officers is , ' if you hang around @entity207 you must be anti-police			1
' ' he 's got ta lose @entity207 , ' @entity0 said .			2

in one memorable - and controversial - address @entity7 suggested that people who steal are asking to get shot by the police
@entity148 's beating , shooting of @entity135 police officers and protesting of @entity139 commissioner is also @entity2 's fault , @entity0 suggested
fresh off a trip abroad , @entity0 contended that @entity6 is considered a ' racist ' by international news *networks*
