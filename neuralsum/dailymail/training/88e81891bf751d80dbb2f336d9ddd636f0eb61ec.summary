fast food litter has hit record levels - and experts are blaming poorly - designed council bins			1
posting junk into narrow ' hatches ' puts people off their lunch and means they throw their cartons on the street instead , said a government - backed report			1
instead councils should be using more bins with wide open rims so people know where they are putting their hands			2
rubbish design : bins with narrow hatches put people off throwing away their junk properly , says a report ' people do n't like to use bins that look full or dirty , ' the report said			1
' this is because people do n't want to touch rubbish inside the bin and do n't want to touch a dirty bin ' - and ones with small hatches are worse campaign group @entity32 revealed the criticism in its annual report on litter funded by the government			1
it found fast food packages including napkins , plastic forks , cartons and salt sachets have shot up in the last decade , from 19 per cent of sites surveyed to 31 per cent			1
they are now the fourth most common type of litter after smoking materials , sweet wrappers and drink cartons			0
the report said there was more litter in areas with bins than in those without			2
' where a bin has been provided , it is not always being used , ' the report said			0
' this could be down to bin design , bin capacity , the bin 's location or the frequency with which it is emptied			0
' people do n't like to use bins that look full or dirty			1
this is because people do n't want to touch rubbish inside the bin and do n't want to touch a dirty bin			2
rise : the report said the amount of litter from fast food has risen sharply in the last ten years to a record high missed ! fast food waste has risen from 19 per cent of all sites a decade ago to 31 per cent of sites now ' bins can become dirty from food and drink staining , chewing gum being stuck to them , and general dirt and grime building up over time			1
' sites with clean bins had significantly less fast food - related litter on the ground compared to sites with dirty bins , which indicates that the cleanliness of a bin has an impact on whether people will use it			1
' it added : ' our work with local authorities suggests that bins with a large opening and the ability to drop rubbish into them , rather than post the rubbish through a narrow opening , are preferable to users			2
' but the report noted open - topped bins were not always the best answer as they encourage pests			0
the @entity109 of @entity110 was carried out by @entity32 on behalf of the @entity111 ( @entity111 )			0
worst offenders : cigarette butts are still the biggest blight followed by sweet wrappers and drink cartons surveys were carried out at 7,200 sites in 45 @entity110 council areas between april 2013 and march 2014			1
the survey looked at seven measures - cleanliness , detritus , weed growth , staining , graffiti , fly - posting and recent leaf and blossom fall			0
cigarette butts and empty packets remained by far the biggest blight on @entity110 's streets - found at almost three quarters of all sites surveyed			1
but conditions were far worse in poor areas - 28 per cent of which were ' unacceptable ' - than wealthy ones , where the figure was just 3 per cent			1
poorest areas had an average of 13 cigarette butts at each site while wealthiest ones had three , and dog mess dropped similarly from 14 per cent to 6 per cent			0
keep @entity148 chief executive @entity147 warned towns are suffering because of government cuts - but insisted people can not rely on the state to clear up their mess			2
getting worse : the report said there was evidence that cuts to council budgets were having an impact deprivation : the poorest areas had the most cigarette butts , litter and dog mess , according to the report ' cuts to local authority budgets continue and some indicators suggest that cleansing is beginning to suffer as a consequence , ' he said			2
' we can not afford to be complacent			0
if we want to keep our country clean and litter - free we can not and must not rely on councils ' capacity to " clean up after us "			0
' the large amount of public money we spend to keep @entity110 clean is unacceptable and a bill that we should not have to keep paying			0
' of the nine @entity110 regions the @entity176 was the cleanest , and the @entity178 and @entity179 were the dirtiest - partly because they had the most densely - packed residents			0
@entity182 environment minister @entity182 said : ' the increase in the prevalence of fast food - related litter over the past ten years is disappointing - packaging and litter associated with eating and drinking accounted for six of the ten most commonly littered items			1
' he added : ' it is sad to see the correlation between poor local environment quality and deprivation			0
' some of the most disadvantaged members of our society also tend to have reduced access to the benefits to physical and mental health associated with high quality , clean , and safe public spaces ' at the same time , the evidence shows that poor levels of local environment quality are associated with increases in other low - level crime and social disorder , further compounding problems for the local community			0

fast food litter jumped from affecting 19 **%** to 31 **%** of sites in a decade
government - backed study *pinned* part of blame on narrow bin openings
keep @entity148 : ' people do n't like to use bins that look full or dirty '
cigarettes remained biggest blight - and poor areas affected far worse
