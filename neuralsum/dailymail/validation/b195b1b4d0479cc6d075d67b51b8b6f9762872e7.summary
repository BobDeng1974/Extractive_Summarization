the fate of @entity1 that was deliberately crashed into the @entity3 has chilling similarities to a number of other aircraft believed to have been downed by flight crew			1
@entity9 pilot @entity8 locked his captain out of the cockpit before ploughing the @entity12 into the mountain at more than 400mph , killing all 150 on board			1
the final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by @entity18 prosecutors who said @entity8 's sole aim was to ' destroy the plane '			1
it echoes a number of recent aviation tragedies and could explain what happened to flight mh370 - which vanished last march while flying from @entity26 to @entity27 with 239 people on board			1
above , workers at the crash site today @entity8 's actions could explain what happened to flight mh370 - which vanished last march while flying from @entity26 to @entity27 with 239 people on board			1
above , file image of a @entity46 aircraft recent analysis of satellite data taken from the lost @entity46 flight indicates the aircraft may have been deliberately flown off course - suggesting the pilot took actions similar to @entity8 's			1
other pilots believed to be responsible for fatal air crashes include @entity55 , who was captain of @entity49 that crashed in @entity56 in november 2013			2
air crash investigators think the @entity59 jet was flown into the ground by the captain after his copilot went to the toilet , killing all 27 passengers and six crew			2
@entity55 was believed to have had serious personal problems at the time of his death			0
when his co-pilot went to the toilet , flight data information recovered from the scene found that @entity55 manually changed the aircraft 's altitude from 38,000 feet to almost 600 feet below ground level			2
he also pushed the aircraft 's throttles back to idle and selected the jet 's maximum operating speed			2

above , the wreckage of the plane chillingly , the cockpit voice recorder picked up the sound of the co-pilot pounding on the door , similar to captain @entity87 's attempts to regain access to the flight deck			1
it emerged today that co-pilot @entity8 made similar changes to his autopilot system - entering a new target altitude of just 96ft moments before the crash			1
the first relief officer of an @entity98 flight was blamed when the aircraft crashed into the @entity100 approximately 30 minutes after leaving @entity101 in @entity102 on october 31 , 1999			0
the @entity103 767 - 366 had 14 crew and 203 passengers on board			0
the @entity107 who investigated the disaster blamed the crash on the flight 's relief first officer			0

above , debris from the downed plane captain @entity117 said he would relieve the current pilot - even though he was n't due on the flight deck for a further three hours			2
the co-pilot remained with @entity117 , but when the co-pilot went for a toilet break , the aircraft went into a steep dive and crashed into the sea , killing everyone on board			0
the cockpit flight recorder heard @entity117 claim in @entity130 ' i place my fate in the hands of @entity134 ' before the aircraft hit the ocean			0
@entity137 even shut down the aircraft 's engines , which prevented his co-pilot from saving the aircraft			0
according to the @entity107 ' the probable cause of the crash of @entity144 was the airplane 's departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the @entity100 as a result of the relief first officer 's flight control inputs			0
' the reason for the relief first officer 's actions was not determined			0
' in december 1997 , a @entity155 with 97 passengers and seven crew crashed into the @entity158 in southern @entity159 , @entity160			0
the @entity107 investigated this crash as it involved a @entity163 - built aircraft and determined that the jet crashed due the ' direct flight control inputs ' of the pilot , probably the captain			1
however , in both cases , @entity169 and @entity160 authorities do not accept that either of their pilots would have deliberately crashed their own aircraft .			1

@entity8 deliberately crashed @entity9 plane into @entity3
echoes other aviation disasters believed to have been caused by crew
could explain final moments of flight mh370 which vanished last march
analysis of satellite data suggests plane was deliberately flown off course
would suggest pilot of the doomed jet took actions similar to @entity8 's
