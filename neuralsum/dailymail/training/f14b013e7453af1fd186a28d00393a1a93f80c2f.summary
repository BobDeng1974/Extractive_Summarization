it is understood to have paid 2.05billion yen ( $ 26million ) to the @entity12 family for three of the five @entity14 islands , which are known as the @entity14 group in @entity9			1
the move would effectively nationalise them and stop @entity9 from buying the chain , which lie 200 miles from the @entity9 mainland and 200 miles from @entity4 's @entity20			1
it follows months of rising diplomatic tension between the two countries over which has sovereignty over them			2
the oil - rich islands in the @entity28 have been heavily disputed by @entity9 and @entity4 the acrimony has seen @entity9 protesters overturning @entity4 cars in the streets last month and their @entity4 rivals swimming to the islands and planting their national flag on its soil			1
tensions over the islands have flared since april , when @entity40 's nationalist governor , @entity39 , announced a plan for the city government to raise money to buy the islands so that they would not be vulnerable to purchase by a third party such as @entity9			1

@entity9 responded by calling the reported purchase ' illegal and invalid			1
' @entity69 spokesman @entity68 said : ' for them to nationalize the @entity14 islands seriously violates @entity9 's sovereignty and hurts the @entity9 people 's feelings			1
' i stress again that any of their unilateral acts with the @entity14 islands are illegal and invalid			0
' @entity9 's determination will not change in terms of safeguarding its territory			2
@entity9 is observing the situation and will take necessary measures to defend its sovereignty			2
' while the move would clearly anger @entity9 , media reports said that the purchase is intended more as a means of squelching @entity39 's more inflammatory proposal , which includes development plans			2
the islands are near key sea lanes and surrounded by rich fishing grounds and untapped natural resources			0
no development would take place under the national plan , the reports said			0
the media reports said funding for the purchase would require @entity102 approval , something likely to happen in the next week or two			0
they said the final deal could be closed by the end of the month			0
chief cabinet secretary @entity107 said the government and owner are still talking and he would not comment on details about the discussion			0
' we are negotiating with the owner while we try to grasp where the situation stands between ( the central government ) and the @entity40 metropolitan government , ' @entity107 said			0
he said the government would make an announcement ' when we reach a result after completing the process			0
' @entity39 said he had spoken to the owners of the islands and claimed they told him that no final deal had been made yet			0
rising tensions : protesters in @entity127 , @entity9 , hold placards and banners at a demonstration against @entity4 's claim of the disputed islands last month land grab : the protests in @entity9 came after @entity4 activists swam to the islands and raised their national flag on the disputed territory disputed : a @entity4 activist waves the country 's flag after landing on a group of islands known as @entity14 in @entity4 and @entity14 in @entity9 city officials said there has been no change in @entity40 's plans to try to buy them , or for @entity39 to visit the area himself sometime next month			1
they said , however , that the government was dealing directly with @entity39 , and said they did not know the context of those talks			0
government representatives met with @entity12 family members on monday and agreed on the basic terms of the sale , the reports said			0
the dispute over the islands grabbed headlines after a sept. 7 , 2010 , incident in which a @entity9 fishing boat collided with @entity4 coast guard ships near the islands			1
the @entity9 fishing boat captain was arrested and then released			2
the dispute had been on the back burner as @entity4 struggled to recover from last march 's devastating earthquake , tsunami and nuclear disaster .			2
