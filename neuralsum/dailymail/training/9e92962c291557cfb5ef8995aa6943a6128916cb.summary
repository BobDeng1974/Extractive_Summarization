prosecutors in @entity13 , @entity11 had asked for an exceptional sentence of 10 years			2
@entity2 's attorneys sought zero to 12 months , arguing that he might have taken the incriminating pictures before the state made voyeurism a felony in 2006			2
jailed : @entity21 , shown being led into court on friday , has been sentenced to 30 months in prison hearing : @entity2 at today 's sentencing , where he got a sentence much more lenient than prosecutors wanted the 62 - year - old was found guilty of 14 counts of voyeurism by a jury last month			1
he will get credit for time already served in prison , reducing his sentence to around 21 months			0

his son and her husband , @entity2 , killed himself and his two young sons in a february fire at a home in @entity44			1
@entity2 was the prime suspect in @entity34 's disappearance			1
@entity21 was arrested last september after investigators searching his home for evidence in mrs @entity34 's disappearance came across computer disks with what they described as thousands of images of women and girls who seemed unaware they were being photographed			2
those filmed , prosecutors say , included neighborhood girls , who were identified in court only by their initials and who were about eight and 10 when the images were recorded			0
victim : evidence relating to @entity2 's missing daughter - in - law @entity34 was not allowed to be used in the trial family : @entity2 's son @entity66 killed himself and his two children @entity68 and @entity69 in february this year the mother of @entity2 's victims addressed him at sentencing , trembling and tearful as she stood with her back to him			1

' i 'm so angry			0
i 'm angry for the hurt you caused my children			0
you caused them embarrassment and heartache ' @entity2 , wearing a grey jail uniform , declined to speak in court			0
deputy prosecutor @entity89 asked for an exceptional 10 - year sentence , noting the number of offenses and that @entity2 not only secretly watched the girls , but ' memorialised ' his offence by recording them so he could watch them over and over			1
@entity2 's lawyers , @entity96 and @entity97 , argued that 10 years was far beyond what any other convicted voyeur has received in @entity100			2
one other defendant charged with similar offenses received a sentence of 261 days , but he took responsibility for his crimes			0
judge : @entity107 reviews documents during the sentencing hearing in @entity13 , @entity11 relief : @entity111 , @entity34 's sister , hugging a relative after the guilty verdict was read in @entity2 's trial last month mr @entity96 urged judge @entity107 to pay no mind to the intense media attention on the case			1
' we ca n't ignore the fact that there 's intense public interest in the outcome of this case , ' he said			0
' i would ask you not to punish mr @entity2 for the conduct of his son			2
' before sentencing @entity2 , mr @entity107 threw out two of the 14 voyeurism convictions , saying they appeared to be redundant - that is , @entity2 had faced multiple counts based on the same recording sessions			2
@entity2 's lawyers sought to have all but two of the counts dismissed - one count for each victim - on the grounds that the state could n't prove the images were not all recorded in one long recording session on a single day			1
the judge declined , saying he did not have enough evidence to overrule the jury 's decision to convict him on those counts			0
among the images recovered from @entity2 's home were many of @entity34 that appeared to have been filmed without her knowledge , investigators said			1
there were also said to be journals in which @entity2 detailed his obsession with his daughter - in - law			1
much of that evidence had been barred from the trial as unduly prejudicial against the defendant			0
@entity2 was not charged with acts of voyeurism involving mrs @entity34 because authorities could not prove she was unaware of the filming .			1

@entity164 sought 10 - year sentence for photographing neighbourhood girls aged eight and 10
@entity2 also obsesses over daughter - in - law @entity34 before she disappeared
his son @entity66 killed himself and his two children in february
