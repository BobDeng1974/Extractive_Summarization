@entity0 negotiated a tricky test against @entity2 to reach his 28th @entity4 quarter - final at the @entity5 on sunday			1
@entity6 3 @entity0 came through a tight first set before easing to a 7 - 5 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 victory against @entity9 which seals a last - eight clash with @entity11			1
@entity0 said : ' i am very happy with the way i played today			2
probably the best match of the year so that is very important for me			0
@entity0 wasted little time in dispatching @entity2 and reaching the quarter - finals @entity0 battled through the first set and never looked back to book his spot in the last eight ' for me [ the ] quarter - finals is a great result			1
arriving here after losing in the first round of @entity23 , not playing matches for the last seven months , to be in the quarter - finals again here is a very positive thing for me			0
' @entity2 will rue several missed chances in the first set when he failed to convert any of five break points at 5 - 5 and then missed a volley in the next game to go one set down			2
@entity0 then took charge , dropping just one game in the second set and one break was enough in the third for the @entity37 to claim victory in two hours and six minutes			1
the 28 - year - old now goes on to face seventh seed @entity11 after the @entity41 continued his serene progress through the draw with a 6 - 2 , 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) , 6 - 2 win against @entity46 @entity45			1
@entity0 may be favourite given that he has beaten @entity11 in all of their last 17 meetings , but the latter looks to be in fine form with @entity52 's ex-coach @entity51 now by his side			2
@entity0 said : ' it does n't matter what happened in the past			2
it is a different story this time			0
different moment for me , different moment for him			0
' i have success against him , but i have the chances to lose against him			0
i remember in 2012 i had a very , very tough match against him here			0
i was close to being two sets to love down			0
' @entity0 celebrates his victory over @entity2 in typical fashion as he makes through in @entity70 @entity0 is spoilt for choice as two ball boys offer him a towel during a break in play @entity2 failed to convert his set points in the first set and paid the ultimate price			1

@entity0 eased into the fourth round with victory over @entity2
@entity37 faced set points in the opening set but held his nerve
@entity0 then won the next two sets with ease to progress in @entity70
the former champion will now take on no 7 seed @entity11
