off the coast of @entity2 near the @entity4 city of @entity5 a hidden world lies buried 28ft beneath the ocean waves			1
the @entity7 , also known as @entity8 , is a collection of sculptures deliberately placed on the ocean floor by @entity13 artist @entity12			1
each of the 460 statues in the underwater exhibition are made from @entity18 - neutral marine concrete designed to encourage marine plants to grow and attract fish to the region , and the museum was set up to draw tourists away from nearby coral reefs			1
the @entity7 , also known as @entity8 , is a collection of sculptures created by @entity13 artist @entity12			1
the exhibition is placed underwater off the coast of @entity2 and @entity5 , @entity4			1
each of the statues and items on display are made from @entity18 - neutral marine concrete according to the tourist board , around 300,000 people visit the area each year , but snorkeling groups have been known to cause damage to marine life , for example , by kicking them as they swim past			1
@entity39 , director of the @entity40 , said : ' if they swim near the corals , the divers with little experience might kick them with a fin or hit them with the oxygen tank			0
before it was declared a park , the tourists even climbed up the corals and walked on top of them , breaking and shattering them			2
' @entity52 added : ' something had to be done about the damage to the local reef areas			0
hurricanes , tropical storms and mankind were taking their toll on these natural gardens			0
' he came up with the idea of submerging life - sized statues in order to create an artificial reef area where coral could grow , and in which marine life and fish could live and breed			1
the @entity8 collection is made up of 450 life - sized sculptures , like the one pictured			1
some 400 sculptures were submerged in 2010 and 50 new ones were added in august 2012			0
the whole display is known as @entity75 @entity76 designed the sculptures to become artificial reefs in a bid to draw tourists away from the coral reefs off the coast of @entity5			1
the natural reefs were becoming damaged because snorkelers would accidentally kick them as they swam through			1
the project began in 2009 and many of the displays , pictured left and right , have already started growing plants and attracting marine life although this gives the statues an eerie appearance many of the statues were made to resemble members from the local community in @entity2			1
this image shows one of the models , far left , and the various stages of marine life growth on his neutral concrete statue since 2009 , from left to right			1
as well as encouraging growth , the artificial reef will change over time giving tourists a different look each time @entity76 then teamed up with @entity39 as well as @entity107 , the president of the @entity109 for @entity5 and @entity2 , to create the attraction			1
around 400 of the sculptures were submerged in 2010 and 50 new statues were added in august 2012			2
the whole display is known as @entity75			0
some corals , including fire coral , have been planted on and near the initial sculptures to encourage more coral to grow			1
the statues themselves have also naturally become covered with coral over time			1
the designers collected the coral from damaged fragments washed up following tropical storms			2
they also grew a small portion artificially			0
as well as encouraging growth , the artificial reef will change over time giving tourists a different look each time they visit			2
the statues in the display form the shape of an eye which helps disperse currents and tropical storms			2
a number of fish species have returned to the area after not being seen for years			0
over 100 angelfish , pictured , were recently spotted surrounding the statues fire coral was planted on a number of the statues , left and right , to encourage other marine life to grow			1
fire coral is a fast growing coral that was placed in the holes of each of these statues			2
the designers collected the coral from damaged fragments washed up following tropical storms			2
they also grew a small portion artificially the majority of statues in the display form the shape of an eye , designed in such a way to control and disperse currents in the area , and reduce the risk of tropical storms caused by these currents			2
a number of fish species , including angelfish , have also returned to the area after not being seen for years as a result of the sculptures , according to the museum , and more than 100 were recently spotted surrounding the statues			2
many of the statues were made to resemble members from the local community in @entity2 , while others were designed especially for the display			1
these include a sculpture of a suited man with his head buried in the sand , called @entity183			0
the sculpture is said to ' depict the recent denial and lack of transparency defined by the current economical crisis			0
' its design ' supports an internal living space for crustaceans and juvenile fish to breed			0

the sculpture weighs eight tonnes and specifically contains internal spaces for lobsters and crustaceans in august 2012 @entity76 submerged five new pieces to accompany @entity183			2
this included a sculpture of a @entity206 , the design of which was used to let fish and marine life swim through and live in the crevices of the car and its tyres			1
