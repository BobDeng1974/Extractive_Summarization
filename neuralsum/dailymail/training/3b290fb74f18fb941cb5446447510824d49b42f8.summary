by @entity0 @entity2 's @entity1 won the @entity3 in a play - off with @entity5 after a dramatic final day at @entity6			1
@entity7 was in early at 13 under after a superb eight - under - par 64 and waited for around 90 minutes while the other leading challengers fell apart on the closing stretch			1
overnight leader @entity10 dropped out of contention altogether after shedding three shots on the 14th and 15th holes of the @entity15 - designed course			2
company : @entity15 presents @entity1 with the trophy after he won the @entity3 @entity1 almost followed , requiring birdie at the last - after breaking his driver - to finish alongside @entity7 and force a play - off			1
both players made a terrible mess of the extra hole , with @entity1 's tee - shot - with a wood , having not replaced the damaged club - finding sand before @entity7 drove into the creek on the left of the fairway			1
na then missed right while @entity1 struck a spectator on the other side , but the @entity2 player produced a superb flop on and holed out for par and victory			1
delight : @entity1 celebrates his close victory at @entity6 in @entity37 , @entity38 fight to the finish : the @entity2 needed a play - off to see off the challenge from @entity5 the 22 - year - old told @entity43 : ' i 'm just happy			1
this is a dream come true to win at mr @entity15 ' golf course , it could n't be better			0
' earlier , @entity7 came from off the pace with the help of birdies at all four par fives in a tremendous bogey - free round			1
he revealed he had been inspired by @entity15 , part of the commentary team for @entity59 network @entity58 , claiming on saturday night that the players seven shots back were still in contention			0
' i was watching tv and when he said five under had a chance , i thought ' really ? ' , ' he told the same network			0
it was a battle but i thought i did very well			0
it 's a hard golf course , i know the guys are tearing it up but we all know it 's not easy			0
' well done , son : @entity1 is congratulated by golf legend @entity15 that was proved several times over in a madcap final hour			2
@entity10 started well by holing a 34 - foot birdie putt from off the front of the first green and picking up another shot at the fourth after an excellent tee shot			1
but he failed to make the most of the two par fives on the front nine , with his birdie putt on the seventh sliding just past			0
@entity1 opened with two birdies , the second via a hole - out from a greenside bunker , and after dropping a shot at the next he birdied the fourth from 15 feet			2
back - to - back birdies at seven , where he hit his 89 - yard approach within tap - in range , and eight took him alongside @entity10 , who dropped a shot at the ninth but birdied the next two to regain his lead			2
@entity1 hit a wonderful approach to the 13th , just skirting over a bunker , to set up birdie but gave the shot back at the next to leave @entity10 alone in front once more			1
the @entity102 champion , though , also slipped up at the 14th to drop back to 14 under and then , looking for birdie on the long 15th , hit a bafflingly wayward tee shot out of bounds into a neighbouring garden as the madness set in			0
faltered : @entity10 was on course for victory in @entity38 before a final round of 72 leading the charge : @entity111 was the highest placed @entity112 , finishing tied for 13th on seven under he found the fairway at the next attempt but surprisingly laid up from around 250 yards and eventually took seven - and as @entity1 double - bogeyed the 16th via the water , @entity7 was suddenly sharing the lead again and duly headed to the practice ground			1
@entity10 narrowly avoided the same hazard but could only make par , and @entity1 dropped another shot at 17 to leave @entity7 in front on his own			1
with players figuratively losing their heads , @entity1 took it to a literal extreme after a poor drive at the last by slapping his driver on the ground and breaking the head off it			0
but he regathered himself and , after a marvellous approach , birdied the hole for the fourth time this week to make the play - off			2
@entity10 was one shot back after narrowly missing the last green and failing with an audacious chip			0
@entity138 1 @entity137 shared fourth place with @entity140 , having gone out in 32 but come home in 39			0
the @entity142 birdied 11 to share the lead but found water at 12 and though he partially recovered from that double bogey with a birdie , three successive bogeys dropped him out of contention			0
@entity140 shot 68 , finishing birdie - eagle - birdie - bogey , and sixth place was shared by @entity151 and @entity152 at nine under			0
@entity154 @entity153 finished in a group at eight under and produced arguably the shot of the day , holing an outlandish flop from creekside rough at the 11th for birdie			0
@entity112 's @entity111 was seven under and @entity161 's @entity160 a further shot back after finishing an eventful tournament with a level - par 72			1
@entity10 's playing partner @entity163 , who was just one stroke off the lead overnight , faded with a seven - over 79 to finish four under - but provided another of the highlights of the day when his birdie putt at the 16th oscillated on the lip of the hole for more than 20 seconds before dropping in to raucous cheers .			2
