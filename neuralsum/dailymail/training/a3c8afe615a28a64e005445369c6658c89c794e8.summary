@entity0 insisted he will not quit as @entity2 manager despite admitting he was ' devastated ' after his side 's 2 - 1 defeat to @entity5 at the @entity6			1
the result leaves the @entity2 bottom of @entity9 with zero points and needing @entity11 to win their two remaining matches and hope they can beat @entity15 themselves on tuesday			2
and , after @entity17 scored twice for the @entity18 , @entity0 said : ' i do n't have any intention to resign			1
' i 'm bitter disappointed , of course , but i do n't feel i need to resign , no. ' on the other hand , if the @entity38 think i 'm not the right man to do the job ... ' we believed we could do enough to get a result in this game			1
having worked so hard to get back to 1 - 1 i believed we would go on to win the game or at least draw , so to concede the second goal is an unbelievable blow			1
i do n't really know what to say at this time			2
' we are more then disappointed , we 're devastated			0
' it was a goal we do n't expect to concede			2
long goal kicks with the type of players we have in the team , we deal with them			0
' i thought we would go on possibly to win the game and certainly i did n't think we would lose the game at that point			0
' we had been in control for such a long time			0
after the first five minutes ( of the second half ) we got back on track			0
we 've been near their goal so many times , but it does n't matter how many times you get near the other team 's goal , it matters how many times you put it in the back of the net and we have n't done that enough			2
' on @entity17 , he said : ' he scored the two goals			1
the first goal in particular was exceptionally good , @entity75 's chip and his pulling away to the back post and the cleverness of his header i thought was really top , top play			0
the second one i thought he was a bit fortunate , but when he got himself through he made no mistake			0
' so close : @entity84 shot straight at the goalkeeper when he found space in the penalty area how did he miss ? @entity84 powers his header against the bar from point - blank range tussle : @entity2 's @entity92 challenges @entity75 of @entity5			1

@entity2 lost 2 - 1 to @entity5 after @entity17 scored twice for the @entity18
@entity0 's side have now lost two out of two this @entity6 *campaign*
questions will no doubt be asked of the @entity2 manager , however @entity0 has remained *defiant* and *adamant* he will not quit his job
@entity0 said : ' i do n't have any intention to resign ' .
