did he do it ? law students have suggested @entity3 could have killed @entity4 in 1999 the @entity6 's @entity5 has identified another suspect who they say could be linked to the death of @entity4 , whose murder was the focus of the hit podcast series ' serial '			1
@entity3 , who was released from prison 10 days before @entity15 vanished in january 1999 , could have been responsible for her death , they say , and they are now hoping to test physical evidence in the case against his dna			1
he killed himself in 2012			0
@entity15 's body was found in a @entity25 park just weeks after she broke up with her boyfriend , @entity27 , who was ultimately convicted of murder and is now serving life in prison for the death			1
@entity27 , then 17 , has always insisted that he was over their break up and did not murder her , and there was no physical evidence linking him to the crime			1
but a friend , identified on the podcast as ' @entity40 ' , claims @entity27 told him he had murdered her and helped him bury her body			1
his story and the investigation around @entity15 's murder were the subject of the highly - popular podcast series , @entity48 , and in the final episode , @entity6 's @entity5 suggested other suspects			1
in an interview with @entity54 , @entity51 , the head of the @entity5 at @entity6 , suggested that @entity3 could have had a part in her death			2
@entity3 , who committed suicide while in prison in 2012 , aged 40 , was identified as a suspect in a 1999 rape and a 1999 cold case rape - murder when his dna later matched the crimes			1
accused : @entity27 , left , is serving a life sentence for the murder of his ex-girlfriend , @entity4 , but has always said he is innocent			1
the podcast series , @entity48 , delved into the crime to see if he was guilty in one case reported in the @entity71 at the time of his suicide , police said a dna match in 2006 connected him to a sexual assault in which he broke into a woman 's apartment , shocked her with a cattle prod , and forced her to perform sex acts on him			1
earlier this year , the @entity82 reported that another @entity22 match connected him to a 1999 murder , in which he broke into 27 - year - old @entity86 's apartment and strangled her			0
@entity87 , who produced the podcast , ultimately did not conclude whether @entity27 was guilty or not he was arrested for burglary in december 2011 - and was listed as one of @entity91 at the time			2
he ultimately took his life in 2012			0
@entity51 believes he could have had something to do with @entity15 's murder in january 1999			2
' in some ways , he was ideal because he had been released from prison and fit the timeframe for @entity4 's murder because he had been out for 10 days when she was murdered , ' she told @entity54			0
but @entity51 said she and her team are also pursuing other theories and looking into other potential suspects - who can not be named because they are still alive - while they wait for the courts to test the evidence , which could take months			2
@entity51 admitted there were some problems with @entity3 as a suspect , including that he had been tied to sexual assaults but @entity15 was apparently not sexually assaulted			0
however , @entity51 said that she knows a rape kit was carried out on @entity15 's body - and that it was not tested			0
' what we know is that @entity4 had her clothes on , although i know her shirt and bra had been moved up , ' @entity51 told @entity54			0
' and her skirt was on but pushed up ... there were hairs on her body , two of which were microscopically compared to @entity27 , and he was excluded and they did n't belong to her either			0
' if it comes back as a match with @entity3 's dna , it should show @entity27 is not guilty , she said			0
close : friends said @entity27 moved on after his break up from @entity15 but prosecutors said he killed her out of anger alternatively , it could match someone else who 's already locked up , or it could belong to someone not known to the authorities - but that , too , should clear @entity27 of her murder , she said			2
' if there was semen and it was not her boyfriend and it was not @entity27 , and we still could n't point out a serial killer or a serial rapist , i would still argue - depending on what that physical evidence there was - that that should also exculpate @entity27 , ' she told @entity54			1
one problem with @entity3 as the suspect is that @entity40 led police to @entity15 's car after he said he and @entity151 buried her body , and @entity51 can not yet account for this			2
' but i wonder about whether @entity40 somehow got involved with people who had some other entire scheme going on and it 's them he 's afraid of , ' she said			0
she added that serial host @entity87 may have uncovered some leads they can pursue , mostly legal quibbles , while @entity161 users have also suggested another suspect .			0
