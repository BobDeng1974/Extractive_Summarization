an entrepreneur has made $ 200,000 out of the tragedy of the @entity3 outbreak by selling a domain using the virus ' nameto a @entity7 marujuana company			1
@entity8 , who monitors a number of ' disease domains ' from his home in @entity12 , bought @entity13 in 2008 for $ 13,500 and has been waiting for the moment to cash in			1
and this week that moment came , when a @entity7 firm called @entity17 bought the name for $ 50,000 more than @entity20 's initial asking price , reported business news website @entity22			1
it has not been revealed at this time how a company specializing in marijuana plans to use the @entity38 domain purchase			1
the businessman also owns @entity40 and @entity41 , as well a domain for the deadly mosquito - borne disease @entity44 and another for the @entity3 - like marburg virus			1
' @entity13 would be a great domain for a pharmaceutical company working on a vaccine or cure , a company selling pandemic or disaster - preparedness supplies , or a medical company wishing to provide information and advertise services , ' mr @entity8 told @entity54 before the sale			1
' there could be many other applications as well			0
with so many people concerned about the disease , any advertisement referring people to @entity13 should get an excellent response			2
' in an interview with the @entity64 , mr @entity8 said he felt that a six figure sum was more than reasonable for @entity13			1
' according to our site meter , we 're already doing 5,000 page views per day just by people typing in @entity70 to see what 's there , ' he said			2
' we 're getting inquiries every day about the sale of it			0
i have a lot of experience in this sort of domain business , and my sense is that $ 150,000 is reasonable			1
' mr @entity8 , who also owns @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , appeared untroubled about the issue of making money from a human tragedy			1
the @entity87 called the outbreak ' most severe acute health emergency in modern times ' ' but you could say the same thing about doctors , ' @entity20 told the @entity64			0
' they can become very well - off treating very sick patients			0
' besides we have sacrificed a couple of thousands in parking page income to put up links about @entity3 on the site			1
and people can also donate to @entity102 at the site			2
' the hemorrhagic fever , which has no proven cure , has killed more than 4,000 people in @entity27 since an outbreak that began in march			0
the @entity87 called the outbreak ' most severe acute health emergency in modern times '			0
the risks of failing to contain @entity3 in @entity27 have come into sharp focus in the @entity111 after the first patient diagnosed with the disease on @entity111 soil , @entity115 , died last week			1
@entity116 , a professor at the @entity117 in @entity118 is hoping to find a cure for the deadly virus using ' crowdfunding ' on the internet mr @entity8 told the @entity64 he wants to sell the domain soon because he is worried something may ' ameliorate ' the outbreak , diminishing @entity3 's news value and the value of the domain			1
' @entity3 is either something that could become more of a problem , or it 's something that could ameliorate and not be a big news story for that much longer , ' he said			1
but the entrepreneur still has other domain 's to fall back on should @entity38 lose its value			2
' our domain , birdflu.com , is worth way more than @entity13			1
we 're definitely holding onto that one for the event , ' he said , referring to an outbreak he believes could be far bigger than @entity3			1
@entity141 used to treat aid worker dr. @entity142 ( pictured )			0
an appeal is hoping to raise money to speed up the research into the drugs ' that one 's airborne and @entity3 would never go airborne in the @entity111 like bird flu can			2
' in @entity150 , a different individual has also turned to the internet to raise money			0
but rather than capitalizing on the outbreak immunologist @entity116 is hoping to find a cure for the deadly virus			0
the professor at the @entity117 in @entity118 is hoping that @entity158 ' crowdfunding ' will help provide the extra money needed to speed up the research			0
she is in charge of an international consortium developing the new @entity164 drugs that helped formulate the experimental @entity166 serum that used to treat two @entity111 aid workers who contracted @entity3 in @entity168 and recovered			2
dr. @entity116 posted an appeal on the @entity171 website seeking at least $ 100,000 in contributions for purchasing equipment that will allow researchers to more quickly analyze blood samples of antibodies from survivors of the hemorrhagic fever			2
the appeal has so far raised nearly $ 17,500 in donations			0
the @entity117 - led consortium was established with a $ 28 million grant from the @entity183 , but the rapidly growing scope of its work has placed additional demands on limited resources			0
specimens are being sent to dr. @entity116 's lab from around the world , ' but the number of samples outpaces the ability of her current equipment to process them ' , the website said in a message			0
@entity166 is a mix of three antibodies designed to bind to proteins of the ebola virus , preventing it from replicating and triggering the immune response of infected cells			0
the compound was tested in monkeys , but there were no human trials of the serum before it was rushed to @entity210 to treat @entity111 aid workers dr. @entity142 and @entity212 after they became infected in @entity168 in july			0
both were ultimately cured , but doctors are unsure whether the @entity166 actually helped them .			0
