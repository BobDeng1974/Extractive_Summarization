by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 18:08 est , 21 june 2012 justified ? if the court comes to the same conclusion when it issues its ruling , @entity1 would avoid criminal responsibility for @entity7 's worst peacetime massacre mass killer @entity1 should be sent to a psychiatric hospital instead of jail , prosecutors said yesterday			1
the 33 - year - old @entity7 murdered 77 people in a shooting and bomb rampage last july			2
however prosecutor @entity14 said there were enough doubts about his sanity to make it impossible to send him to prison			0
the defence is likely to reject the insanity finding today , the last day of the ten - week trial			0
two teams of psychiatrists reached opposite conclusions about @entity1 ’s mental health after his attacks on a government building and a youth summer camp			2
one team diagnosed him with ‘ paranoid schizophrenia ’ , a serious mental illness which would preclude a prison sentence			0
the second team found him sane , saying he suffers from a narcissistic personality disorder			0
@entity1 claims he is sane and his attacks were motivated by his far - right views			0
' we request that he is transferred to compulsory psychiatric care , ' prosecutor @entity14 told the court in closing arguments			0
though there was conclusive evidence that @entity1 was psychotic during the july 22 attacks , there were enough doubts about his sanity that he can not be sentenced to prison under @entity7 law , @entity14 said			1
just like when the trial stared in mid-april , the 33 - year - old @entity7 flashed a clenched - fist salute with his right arm before he was led out of the court today			2
earlier in the trial , @entity1 said the psychiatric dimension of the case was a way for @entity7 authorities to ridicule him and divert attention from his ideology			1
closing arguments : prosecutors @entity14 , left , and @entity61 , right , said there was conclusive evidence that @entity1 was psychotic during the attacks @entity64 : earlier in the trial @entity1 said the psychiatric dimension of the case was a way for authorities to ridicule him and divert attention from his ideology @entity1 claims @entity7 and @entity70 are being colonised by @entity71 , who make up about 2 per cent of @entity7 's population			1
he has said he selected his targets - a government high - rise and a summer camp for the governing @entity78 's youth organisation - to strike against the political forces he claims betrayed the country with liberal immigration policies			0
horror : seventy - seven people died in the attacks at @entity7 's government headquarters and a youth summer camp on the island of @entity87 in july last year prosecutors said one of the key challenges to @entity1 's sanity was his insistence of belonging to a militant anti-muslim modeled after the @entity94 , a @entity96 military order during the crusades , even though investigators have found no trace of the network			1
though @entity1 tried to tone down the significance of the network during the trial , he maintained that it exists and that there are two other cells in @entity7 .			1

if court *favours* prosecution killer would avoid criminal responsibility for @entity7 's worst peacetime massacre
@entity1 has said psychiatric dimension of case is way to divert attention from his ideology
decision likely on *friday*
