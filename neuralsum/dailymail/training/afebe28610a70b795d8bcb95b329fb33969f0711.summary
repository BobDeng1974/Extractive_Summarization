it 's the dream of every internet startup founder to sell their company for millions of dollars			2
but not everyone can make a quick buck like @entity7 founder @entity6 or the investors of @entity9 who recouped enormous amounts of money on their original investments			2
in the case of one startup , @entity16 , the five founders were left with comparatively little even though their company sold for tens of millions of dollars , according to the @entity17			1
disappointment : @entity16 founder @entity18 ( left ) and four co-founders including @entity20 ( right ) were left to split $ 36,000 after their company sold $ 82 million @entity16 was formed in the mid- 1990s to create software for health care providers to monitor claims for fraud			1
mr @entity18 began the company with four colleagues - @entity27 , @entity20 , @entity28 , and @entity29 - and raised $ 1.9 million from venture capitalists in 1999			1
the following year he raised another $ 3.1 million			0
when @entity16 was sold for $ 82.5 million in 2011 , the five founders were paid a collective $ 36,000			0
here 's what each founder received : the timing was not in mr @entity18 's favor , however			0
within just a few years the internet bubble burst and the company began to struggle			0
that 's when investors took over the company and pushed out @entity39 as ceo			2
according to court proceedings , the investors convinced @entity16 's board that replacing @entity39 with a new ceo would make the company more marketable to potential buyers			1
@entity39 was asked to resign in december 2000			0
the move upset co-founder @entity27 , who was then also asked to resign , along with the three other founding employees of the company			0
a new ceo was hired and over the next ten years and several more rounds of financing , the company recovered and began to expand			0
then in april 2011 the company sold for $ 82.5 million to @entity49 mr @entity18 thought his payday had arrived and that he would become an instant millionaire			0
@entity6 : the @entity7 founder made $ 2.3bn in a year thanks to various stock options in the company instant millionaire : @entity9 co-founder and ceo @entity55 sold his firm to @entity7 for $ 300m and 23 million shares cheated : despite the company selling for $ 84m , the five founders of @entity16 split $ 36,000 between them			2
one founder of the company received just $ 99 but investors were paid first - before any of the founders and employees			1
eventually there was just $ 36,000 left in the pot to split between the five founders			1
one received just $ 99			0
@entity16 , formed in the mid- 1990s , provides companies with fraud - monitoring software for health care claims the founders filed suit , claiming that during several rounds of financing following their departure from the company , investors had schemed to dilute their collective holdings to less than 1 percent - without their knowledge - before selling the company			1
in the end , @entity39 received $ 29,266 , @entity28 received $ 4,967 , @entity29 received $ 993 , @entity27 got $ 397 and @entity20 was left with $ 99			2
the story is typical of the world of venture capital which can be a difficult and murky one to grasp			1
founders and employees can be hit in a brutal manner with majority of the cash from any sale going to venture capitalists and holders of preferred shares			1
a recent study , by @entity96			0
@entity98 and @entity99 , concluded in almost 50 per cent of cases , investors were entitled to nothing - even when the company was sold for tens of millions of dollars			2
good negotiator : @entity103 , co-founder of foursquare and has an estimated net worth of $ 80 million dollars lessons : a word of warning to budding entrepreneurs - negotiate your rights and payoff from the company at the very start some 20 per cent to 30 per cent of companies fail , returning nothing to any investor , so when venture capitalists risk supporting a startup they take their share before anyone else			1
there is one trick to bare in mind , and that is to negotiate greater control rights			0
before being blinded by dollar signs , the crucial element is to ensure seats on the board or to insist in having a say in decisions such as if and when the company is sold in the years to come			0
professors @entity98 and @entity99 found in their study that on average , such foresight saw founders receiving around $ 3.7 million more during any sale or takeover			0
whatta deal : sacked @entity142 ceo @entity141 was sacked and received $ 376.36 in severance pay , but he still owns $ 213 million in company shares @entity145 : @entity146 , the co-founder of @entity145 , @entity146 has a net worth of $ 1 billion for @entity16 , eight years had passed since the original founders had been in the chair			2
it meant all new negotiations for cash investment had been carried out on the terms of the venture capitalists			1
the five former colleagues are now suing in a @entity157 court which , if a jury rules in their favor , the @entity17 points out that it could change the way companies operate in future when it comes to balancing the payouts of founders and employees to the rewards that venture capitalists expect .			1

*bloodhound* *technologies* formed in the mid- 1990s
founders eventually left the company and venture capitalists invested
@entity176 grew for a decade before being bought out
investors received huge *windfall* while founders received virtually nothing
founders now suing in a @entity157 court
story is typical of entrepreneurs who fail to secure future ' rights '
