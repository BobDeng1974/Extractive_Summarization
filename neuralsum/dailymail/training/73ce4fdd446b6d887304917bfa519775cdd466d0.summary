parents have branded a secondary school as ' lazy ' after it ordered its pupils to wear name badges to class			1
@entity5 , which opened in @entity6 two years ago and has 317 pupils , introduced tags to help children get to know each other , manage behaviour and help teachers			1
if pupils fail to wear the colour - coded labels showing the pupils ' year and initials of their tutor group , they could face a detention			1
students at @entity5 in @entity6 have to wear name badges as part of school policy the school 's website says the badges are aimed at creating a ' family feel ' and claim they ' reduce the likelihood of any child being unkind to others since everyone is identifiable			1
' but parents have criticised the school for not learning children 's names and say the idea is ' ridiculous '			1
@entity38 , whose daughter in @entity40 has been issued with three name badges , said : ' it is the most stupid idea i have ever seen			0
' i understand the school is growing and they want to keep that family feel so that everyone knows each other but it 's just the height of laziness			2
why ca n't teachers just learn the names like they always have ? ' pupils get to know each other by asking each other 's name rather than reading a name badge			1
it could have a counter-effect			0
' my daughter forgot hers and was given a stern telling off			0
it makes them feel like they 're just machines and it 's incredibly uniformed			0
' while other parents have taken to social media to hit out at the notion			0
@entity68 wrote : ' they should make more effort in educating them , than worrying about who has a name tag on			0
' @entity73 posted on @entity74 : ' teachers should learn to remember their pupils ' names or can they just not be bothered that is bloody ridiculous ! ' @entity79 added : ' it 's just bloody laziness on the school 's behalf			1
it 's not a very good idea			0
' the @entity87 spokesman @entity86 said : ' this is a lazy approach , it 's dreadful			2
' it suggests the teachers are clearly struggling to learn the children 's names despite it being half way through the year			1
it 's very , very important that staff learn the name of the children			2
pupils that fail to wear the badges could face detention			1
parents have branded the coloured labels as ' lazy ' ' if they ca n't be bothered to learn the name of the children they may as well give up teaching			1
' it makes teaching impersonal and teachers are supposed to form a relationship with the pupils they teach whereas this creates distance			2
' with computers creating personalised teaching there is less ' whole - class ' learning and it really is a reflection of the times that teachers do n't feel the need to learn the kids ' names			1
' he also warned that the badges could encourage bullying : ' it 's an intrusion into their identity and privacy and if any child walked out of school with it accidentally still on it 's also a safety issue			2
' the school 's policy is that badges , which show their first names , are left in the children 's lockers overnight and not worn out of school			1
@entity138 , who has a child at the school , believes that the policy of leaving them at school is not practical			1
she said : ' it makes it much easier for strangers to approach children if they can see their name			1
i know they are expected to leave them in their lockers , but if they forget it 's very worrying			2
' another mother , @entity156 , whose son is at the school , is concerned the badges could potentially be used as a weapon			0
' they are extremely sharp and although they are supposed to be left at school , many children wear them home			1
i saw at least 20 walk past me yesterday displaying their name			0
' one mother , who did not wish to be named , said her 13 year - old son has been given countless detentions after making a stand against the rule			2
she said : ' my son wore the badge and caught it in his coat and ripped his jumper			0
he wont wear his and that 's his decision , i have encouraged him and tried to be positive about it but he just wo n't wear it			2
' he has had a detention break and lunchtime for the past week so has not been able to get any fresh air			0
the deputy head told him he is fighting a a battle he simply wont win			0
' my son is quite a quiet child and does n't want all the pupils calling his name all the time			0
i am happy for my son to wear the uniform and i am very strict about it , but the badge is a bit over the top			2
' the school , which is the most recent to open in @entity6 , received its first intake in september 2013 , and currently has two year groups aged 11 to 13			0
this year it will have an intake of 180 students and the school has been built for an eventual capacity of 750 pupils and 100 staff			1
headmistress @entity201 said students who deliberately fail to wear name badges will be ' sanctioned as for a deliberate uniform infringement '			0
she said : ' in keeping with many other schools , @entity5 introduced identity badges for students this term			1
' in our last parental survey , 97.5 per cent of parents agreed with the statement " this school makes sure its students are well behaved " and name badges help to encourage positive behaviour in our students and to maintain the friendly , community feel of our growing college			0
' the vast majority of our students have taken to wearing an identity badge in their usual polite and cooperative fashion			0
' the Â£ 20 million pound building has state - of - the - art @entity223 , sports and performance halls , music and drama studios and large playing fields .			0

@entity5 introduced tags to help children and teachers
colour - coded labels show their first name , year group and tutor group
failure to wear them could lead to a detention for ' infringing uniform policy '
the school opened two years and has 317 pupils but is expected to grow
parents have branded the school as ' lazy ' for not learning pupil 's names
others are worried that leaving them on could make it easier for strangers
