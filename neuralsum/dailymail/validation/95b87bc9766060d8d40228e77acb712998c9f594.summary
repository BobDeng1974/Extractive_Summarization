more than 8.7million flyers were delivered by the company in the year following its privatisation @entity5 has stepped up the amount of junk mail it stuffs through our doors since it was sold off by the government , new figures show			1
more than 8.7million flyers were delivered by the company in the year following its privatisation – sparking fears that it risks becoming a ‘ leaflet distributor ’			1
in the 12 months after privatisation , postmen pushed almost 50,000 more leaflets and advertising letters through our doors every single day , compared to the previous year			0
it means almost 3.2bn items of ‘ unaddressed ’ junk mail were delivered in just one year – almost double the 1.7bn delivered annually five years ago			1
these figures do not even include the vast quantities of ‘ addressed ’ junk mail also delivered , which have the names of occupants on the envelope			1
the rise in unsolicited mail has proved lucrative for @entity5 , which is struggling from increased competition in the parcels market and a fall in the number of ordinary letters being posted			1
revenue from ‘ marketing mail ’ – addressed and unaddressed – has soared to £ 1.1bn a year , earning them £ 3million a day			1
critics last night called for @entity5 to reduce the amount of ‘ nuisance ’ junk mail it delivers or risk becoming a ‘ leaflet distributor ’			1
@entity5 admitted junk mail had become an ‘ important component ’ of its business , and insisted many households found advertising flyers ‘ useful ’			1
but much of unwanted junk mail is never opened and ends up being thrown straight into the bin – causing an environmental headache			2
while some households recycle takeaway menus and pamphlets , many tonnes of junk mail end up in landfill – costing councils tens of millions of pounds to dispose of			2
a spokesman for the @entity62 said : ‘ junk mail is a blight on the nation ’s doormats			2
‘ not only is it a nuisance to pick up and throw away , it adds thousands of tonnes to the waste councils have to pick up creating additional costs for tax payers			0
‘ @entity5 and its direct marketing clients have to do far more to reduce the torrent of junk mail			1
’ @entity76 , of the @entity78 campaign , said marketing mail was ‘ the worst form of advertising ’ because it was foisted upon households without their consent			0
he said : ‘ @entity5 needs to make money but , if they deliver more and more junk mail as a source of income , in the long term i am not sure it is a sustainable business			1
‘ @entity5 is delivering less and less letters			0
they are risking that , in time , they will become a leaflet distributor			2
’ critics claim that some junk mail contain scams sent by fraudsters from overseas			1
critics said the company was running the risk of being labelled a ' leaflet distributor ' with fewer letters being posted every year in 2011 , the @entity104 claimed the @entity5 logo was seen by some victims as a stamp of legitimacy , making the scammers appear more trustworthy			1
at the time , @entity110 , director of the @entity104 , @entity5 and other delivery firms needed to ‘ understand the terrible consequences of delivery of this mail to some people ’			2
@entity5 said the rise in marketing mail was due to the improved @entity119 economy , as companies found they had more money to advertise their goods and services			2
a spokesman said : ‘ marketing mail is mail like any other – it is our job to deliver the mail			0
companies use direct mail because it has proven results			0
‘ many households find the information useful			0
three in five people have acted in response to a piece of advertising mail in the last 12 months as a direct result of receiving door - to - door marketing material			0
’ as people increasingly stop posting letters in favour of email and text messages , @entity5 said marketing mail was an important source of income			0
it said profit from this junk mail was important to ensure the survival of the universal service – its obligation to deliver to every address in @entity119 , six days a week , for the same price			2
they added that revenue from marketing mail helped to ‘ keep @entity119 stamp prices among the best value in @entity162 ’			0
despite this claim , first and second - class stamps will rise by a penny to 63p and 54p respectively on march 30 , sparking claims that loyal customers are being forced to prop up flagging revenue			0
the news sparked accusations from @entity171 that @entity5 had taken the ‘ easy option ’ to raise stamp prices instead of fighting for new custom by improving its services			0
@entity175 , chairman of the influential @entity176 , said @entity5 must invest in new technology and focus on efficiency , rather than simply increasing prices to boost profits .			0
