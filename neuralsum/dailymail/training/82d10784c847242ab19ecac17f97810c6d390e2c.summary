by @entity0 last updated at 12:11 pm on 24th october 2011 a defunct @entity3 research satellite plummeted to earth at speeds of up to 280mph last night and crashed somewhere in @entity6 , a scientist said , but its exact whereabouts remain a mystery			1
@entity9 of the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , said two @entity14 cities with millions of inhabitants each , @entity16 and @entity17 , had been in the minivan - sized satellite 's projected path during its re-entry time			1
' but if it had come down over a populated area there probably would be reports by now , ' the astrophysicist , who tracks man - made space objects , said in a telephone interview			2
artist 's impression : scientists are trying to establish how and where the @entity3 research satellite landed on saturday night , after warning that some parts might survive re-entry and crash at high speeds most parts of the satellite were expected to burn up as they hit the atmosphere , but up to 30 fragments weighing a total of 1.87 tonnes may have survived the re-entry , the @entity38 said			1
calculations based on @entity47 military data indicate that debris of the @entity50 scientific research satellite must have crashed somewhere east of @entity51 over the @entity52 , or over the @entity53 off the coast of @entity55 , or further inland in @entity55 or as far inland as @entity14 , he said			1
the satellite entered the atmosphere between 9:45pm to 10:15pm saturday edt and would have taken 15 minutes or less to hit the ground , the centre said			0
hours before the re-entry , the center said the satellite was not expected to land in @entity64 , @entity65 or @entity66			0
there were no immediate reports from @entity70 governments or space agencies about the fallen satellite , but an exact determination could take days			0
‘ i do n't think that we 'll have a confirmation of any sort today , ’ the @entity38 spokesman said on sunday , pointing out it also took @entity76 several days to establish where one of its satellites had hit last month			0
bus - sized : @entity76 's six - ton @entity83 made its final fiery plunge into the @entity86 's atmosphere last month the 2.69 - ton satellite was launched in 1990 and retired in 1999 after researching black holes and neutron stars and performing the first all - sky survey of x-ray sources with an imaging telescope			1
a dead @entity76 satellite fell into the southern @entity94 last month , causing no damage , despite fears it would hit a populated area and cause damage or kill people			2
experts believe about two dozen metal pieces from the bus - sized satellite fell over a 500 - mile span			0
the largest single fragment that could hit into the earth is the telescope 's heat - resistant mirror			0
during its mission , the satellite orbited about 370 miles above the @entity86 's surface , but after its decommissioning it lost altitude , circling at a distance of only 205 miles above ground in june for example , the agency said			2
even in the last days , the satellite still circled the planet every 90 minutes , making it hard to predict where on @entity86 it would eventually come down			0
the @entity3 space agency put the odds of somebody somewhere on @entity86 being hurt by its satellite at one in 2,000 - a slightly higher level of risk than was calculated for the @entity76 satellite ( see box )			2
but any one individual 's odds of being struck were one in 14 trillion , given there are 7 billion people on the planet .			1

scientist says two heavily populated @entity14 cities were in defunct satellite 's path
up to 30 fragments weighing a total of 1.87 tons could have crashed
but odds of any individual being struck are only one in 14 trillion
