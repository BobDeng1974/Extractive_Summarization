by @entity0 published : 16:09 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 16:35 est , 14 march 2014 parents of pupils at an all - girls ' grammar school were given an unexpected surprise when they clicked on on a website associated with the school to find it plastered with raunchy images			1
families hoping for information to do with @entity12 , in @entity13 , @entity14 , would have been left with something entirely different when clicking on highworthgrammar.co.uk , a web address formerly used by the establishment			1
it is now adorned with six pictures of scantily - clad women - some topless - and links to webcam and sex chat sites			1
raunchy : the explicit website , which was formerly run by the all - girls @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 they include a woman wearing nothing but knickers and stockings - and holding her breasts with her hands			1
there were also x-rated adverts for casual sex , cam chats , and affairs , linking to other explicit sites			0
although the school changed its domain name three years ago , some parents have mistakenly followed to old link to be confronted by the explicit content			2
the address has been bought up by an unknown company which filled the web page with the sexual images and links			1
and although the school is now attempting to buy back the domain and remove the images , there is no guarantee they will be successful			1
switch : @entity57 , pictured , swapped away from its previous web address three years ago contrast : the school 's official website , which switched to its current address three years ago a school spokesman said : ' parents were informed of the changes to the new name and clearly this was acted upon by the great majority of our parents			2
' we also ensured that any links within the internet had been updated to the best of our ability			0
' we have received very few contacts from parents about this problem when they have used a favourite bar or history link and they have been most understanding when we have explained what has occurred			0
' since there was a fair period of time between us moving to our new address and the old address being used to redirect to the adult site , we did not feel that raising general public awareness was warranted and for it to act as free advertising for such adult sites			2
' @entity12 is obviously concerned about the use of the old internet address for such purposes and apologises for any offence to anyone who has inadvertently accessed to old site			2
' the school 's old address was maintained for a period of time after the switch over , redirecting browsers to the updated home page			0
' but the school dropped its subscription , allowing others to purchase the domain			0
we are not in a position to purchase this address back until it next becomes available on the market and we are monitoring the availability			0
' clearly an address advertised and therefore receiving hits is less likely to be released for purchase by the current licence holder			0
