when it comes to the @entity2 , there is always the temptation to forget that @entity4 were ever at the tournament in the first place			1
after all that ’s what the @entity10 , the guardians of the national sport , did after @entity12 beat @entity13 on june 20			0
to put @entity4 ’s embarrassing performance into context , 12 teams - @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 - had not even played their second match when @entity4 were eliminated			1
were you really here ? @entity32 ( second left ) and @entity4 players after the 0 - 0 draw against @entity12 @entity4 missed a trick when the kit skips were loaded on to a plane at the airport in @entity38 after their final group game against @entity12 ended with a 0 - 0 draw			1
it is then that the @entity2 began elsewhere , opening up as @entity42 , @entity21 , @entity43 and @entity17 went deep into this tournament			1
their arrival in the latter stages was no accident			0
all four of those teams , regardless of the outcome of the two semi-finals in @entity38 and @entity52 , have the mentality of champions			2
they arrived in @entity42 expecting to win it			2
being around these teams is an experience , an education into the attitude and psychological determination these teams have on reaching the latter stages of a @entity2			1
ask most @entity42 about their five @entity2 wins and most of them will answer ‘ yes , but why did n’t we win the other 14 ? ’			1
@entity21 have won three and lost four finals , @entity43 were beaten in the 2010 final by @entity69 and @entity17 won it in 1978 and again in 1986			1
they know what it takes			0
@entity4 , as ever , were nowhere			2
to watch and learn from these teams is an exercise in itself , something which @entity4 and the @entity10 could and should have picked up on			1
instead they are monitoring the games from afar			0
in between @entity43 ’s 2 - 1 victory over @entity80 and their semi-final with @entity17 in @entity52 , @entity83 twice threw open the doors to @entity43 ’s training centre			1
it was there , on a beautiful pitch at @entity90 ’s practice ground in the shadows of @entity93 mountain and @entity94 , that the next manager of @entity96 was at work			0
learn from the master : @entity83 ( centre ) is one of the best coaches at this @entity2 listen up : the @entity43 players gather round to hear what @entity102 has to say during training before their @entity2 semi-final against @entity17 @entity106 : @entity43 highlights those two sessions were both open to the public , which meant that any man @entity110 from the street could have walked in to watch @entity102 at work			1
he is certainly an impressive figure			0
this is one of the world ’s leading football bosses , the most flexible and daring coach at the tournament after his decision to throw on a substitute keeper for a penalty shoot - out against @entity122			0
even the loveable @entity124 scout @entity123 , a 79 - year - old man who has been around the block a few times , was sat on the concrete terraces watching @entity102 at work			1
it ’s what people who want to learn do with their days			0
to argue that @entity102 , who won league titles with @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , plus the @entity137 win in 1995 , is somehow ahead of his time would be wrong			2
but let ’s also not forget that this is a guy who has coached some of the world ’s leading footballers during his career			0
there is certainly an aura about him			0
low aiming high : @entity21 coach @entity149 wants to win the nation 's fourth @entity2 whenever he blew his whistle during those sessions - which was rare - his players automatically crowded around him to listen intently to his observations			1
he is the ring - master			0
off the field , there is a different mentality			0
the @entity10 ’s communications team provides key notes for the players to memorise before they speak with the media			0
contrast that with the attitude of the @entity124 , who organised a press conference with @entity166 and @entity167 after @entity102 ’s ballsy substitution in the 119th minute in the quarter - final against @entity12			1
it is unthinkable that @entity4 would have done the same			2
at that same training sessions former @entity43 striker @entity171 , an analyst with @entity124 television , was soaking up some of @entity83 ’s experience			1
he , like everyone else present , wanted to learn			2
then there is @entity149 , the man who held up four fingers to signify @entity21 ’s target to win their fourth @entity2 when he was on his way the aircraft taking the team to @entity42			1
it is what the nation demands , as several players - @entity187 , @entity188 and particularly @entity189 - have referenced at various stages of this tournament			0
‘ we are not a @entity199 team , ’ was @entity189 ’s response to questions about the team ’s performance against @entity28 in @entity196 in the second round			0
they are a tournament team			0
it is incredible to think that @entity4 have become obsessed with technique			2
in doing so , they have lost something else from their game			0
@entity4 got away with this tournament disaster good and proper when they packed they bags and flew out of @entity38 after they picked up their first point of the tournament			1
still , at least the @entity10 have the benefit of replays when they slide back into the sofa and watch the @entity2 on tv .			2

when @entity4 were eliminated from the @entity2 , 12 teams had *n't* even played their second match of the tournament
@entity102 flung open the doors of the @entity124 training camp
those who wanted to learn went and watched
@entity42 , @entity43 , @entity17 and @entity21 all have winning mentality
differences between @entity43 and @entity4 extend to off the pitch , too
