it 's back again , that often derided and much maligned competition currently known as the @entity2			2
@entity3 knows the name has changed enough down the years , but the perception of @entity8 football ’s second domestic cup has remained largely the same thanks to the likes of sir @entity11 and @entity12 ; a tournament for giving the stars a rest and blooding youngsters			2
but everyone has start to somewhere			0
and as the rest of the @entity22 clubs enter the fray at the third round stage , we take a look at the big names who have made their debuts in this competition , and the five stars for the future who could make it big on tuesday and wednesday			1
@entity33 , seen here celebrating the @entity36 semi-final win over @entity37 in 1999 , made his @entity39 debut in 1992 before cementing himself in the club 's history forever @entity42 , a three - time title winner with @entity44 , made his first appearance as a replacement for @entity47 in the 1999 @entity2 win over @entity48 at @entity49 @entity33 age : 17 debut : @entity51 1 - 1 @entity39 , sept 23 , 1992 @entity52 made his @entity39 debut in front 16,649 fans at the @entity55 – nearly three years before his first league appearance – coming on for the last 17 minutes of a second round @entity2 tie as a substitute for @entity60			1
many years later he recalled : ‘ the manager turned to me and said , " get changed , son , you ’re going on "			0
i was so excited i bounced up off my seat and – crack – i hit my head on the dugout ! ’ @entity33 ( left ) played against @entity51 , while @entity69 began in 1999 against @entity70 @entity69 age : 18 debut : @entity70 2 - 2 @entity72 ( 3 - 1 on penalties ) nov 30 , 1999 @entity69 came on for @entity74 in the 89th minute of a tie that was heading for extra-time and penalties at the @entity78 , @entity72 eventually losing the shootout 3 - 1			1
the future @entity81 left back was sent out on loan to @entity83 and made his next appearance three months later – at @entity85			2
the @entity2 can be the window of opportunity for young stars looking to force a way through into first - team reckoning			2
here are five potential debuts to look out for over the next two nights in the @entity2			2
@entity93 ( @entity94 vs @entity70 ) labelled as a ' potential young @entity95 ' by @entity96 , the pressure has been on young @entity93 since he was 15			1
the cultured midfielder seems to have dealt with it well , though , furthering his education with the youth team and seems to be the perfect mould for @entity103			0
with @entity105 out , the time might be now for @entity93 to partner @entity95 in the centre			2
@entity107 ( @entity108 vs @entity109 ) the highly - rated versatile defender penned a new three - year contract at @entity109 in the summer , and could make his bow against @entity108			1
able to carry the ball out of defence and a strong physical presence , @entity107 impressed in the @entity116 on loan at @entity118 last season			0
@entity120 ( @entity72 vs @entity121 ) more of an unearthed diamond , @entity122 has followed a similar route as @entity125 in progressing to a possible debut			1
signed from @entity128 after a successful trial last year , the 21 - year - old slotted straight into the second string and could be on the bench or even start depending on @entity133 ' selection			0
@entity134 ( @entity94 vs @entity70 ) shot to fame with two goals against @entity137 in the @entity138 earlier this month , and could be an option for @entity103 on the wing against @entity70			1
blessed with blistering pace and @entity142 - like dribbling ability , @entity94 beat the likes of @entity44 to sign the 14 - year - old for £ 2million from @entity146 in 2011			1
@entity147 ( @entity83 vs @entity148 ) an immensely talented individual following on from @entity150 and @entity151 , @entity152 hit a hat - trick for the development side earlier this month			0
got a taste of senior football on loan at @entity159 last season , and may be given the chance to shine by @entity161			0
@entity162 @entity42 age : 17 debut : @entity44 4 - 1 @entity48 , oct 28 , 1998 two months before making his first @entity22 appearance for @entity44 , @entity42 came off the bench to replace @entity47 in the 86th minute at @entity49			1
the future @entity81 captain , who was voted @entity44 ’s @entity167 that season , went on to win the trophy in 2005 and 2007			2
@entity42 has gone on to become a @entity44 legend , 16 years after his first appearance for the club @entity96 age : 18 debut : @entity173 1 - 3 @entity94 , sept 22 , 1993 the man who became known simply as ‘ @entity175 ’ at @entity176 announced his arrival in @entity94 ’s senior side by scoring with a wonderful left - foot volley on his debut at @entity181 , the first of 183 strikes for the club			1
amazingly , @entity96 followed that up by scoring five in the second leg a fortnight later , becoming one of four players in @entity94 ’s history to achieve such a feat. @entity96 scored on his debut at @entity181 in 1993 , and scored five in the return leg @entity193 age : 16 debut : @entity72 1 - 1 @entity195 ( 9 - 8 on penalties ) , oct 28 , 2003 the @entity197 was one of seven debutants in @entity12 ’s line - up , becoming @entity72 ’s youngest ever player at the age of 16 years 177 days			1
fabregas played 85 minutes of a tie that went to extra-time and penalties – the @entity206 prevailed 9 - 8 in a shootout – and went on to become their youngest ever scorer as well when he netted against @entity208 in the next round			0
midfielder @entity193 first entered the fray in 2003 in a draw against @entity195 @entity212 age : 19 debut : @entity214 1 - 2 @entity39 , sept 21 , 1994 @entity212 celebrated the first of his 718 appearances for @entity39 by scoring twice at @entity217 two months before his 20th birthday , the first a cheeky dink over the goalkeeper			1
amazing as it seems now , there was a storm of protest from @entity214 fans over @entity11 ’s decision to send out an under - strength team that also included @entity33 , @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230			0
the local mp even raised the issue in the @entity233			0
@entity212 , one of @entity39 's greatest ever players , made his debut two years later than @entity33 @entity236 made his debut in the @entity2 at @entity237 , and scored the winner at the @entity239 @entity236 age : 17 debut : @entity237 0 - 1 @entity137 , sept 19 , 2000 @entity236 was one month shy of his 18th birthday when he went on as a 77th - minute substitute at the @entity243 and scored the decisive goal seven minutes later			1
‘ i remember it was pouring down with rain when i came on , ’ he said later			0
‘ being 17 , i was a bit nervous so my first touch was a pass back			0
then on my second touch i just hit a shot on the volley with my left foot and it went			0
’ @entity254 age : 17 debut : @entity39 3 - 1 @entity70 , sept 23 , 2008 @entity254 started alongside @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258 , playing the full 90 minutes on his debut			1
the teenager went on to make four more appearances in the competition that season , including the final at @entity264 when @entity39 beat @entity265 on penalties			0
@entity254 started his @entity39 career with a 3 - 1 win over @entity70 in the @entity2 @entity269 age : 19 debut : @entity72 2 - 0 @entity271 , sept 22 , 2009 the @entity273 keeper earned his opportunity after impressing in the reserves and rewarded @entity12 ’s faith by keeping a clean sheet at the @entity278			1
but @entity269 still had to go out on loan at @entity280 before establishing himself as no 1 at the club			0
@entity269 was used by @entity12 in the 2 - 0 in over @entity271 at the @entity278			0

@entity33 and @entity212 made their @entity283 debuts in the @entity2 ; @entity33 in 1992 and @entity212 two years later
@entity69 made his first @entity72 appearance in 1999 against @entity70
@entity44 captain @entity42 came on as a substitute against @entity48 in 1999
@entity193 and @entity96 also made debuts in the @entity2
more recently , @entity269 and @entity254 entered the fray in @entity2 ties at the end of the last decade
the likes of @entity93 ( @entity94 ) , @entity122 ( @entity72 ) and @entity107 ( @entity109 ) could make their debuts in the @entity2
