by @entity1 reporter published : 19:53 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 19:54 est , 8 august 2013 a rioter has been evicted from his council flat exactly two years after he looted a bank during the @entity6 violence			1
it is believed to be the first successful eviction carried out in relation to the riots			2
@entity11 , 37 , joined a mob to burgle the @entity14 branch in @entity15 , @entity16 , south @entity6 , on august 8th , 2011			1
he was convicted of burglary and jailed for three years in 2012			2
@entity18 , which owns @entity11 ’s flat in @entity20 , @entity21 , started proceedings to evict him following his conviction			1
punishment : @entity11 , 37 , is the first person to be evicted as a result of his part in the @entity6 riots of 2011 anniversary : his eviction , thought to be the first in connection with the riots , happened two years on from the trouble itself after a ‘ lengthy legal process ’ an eviction order was granted in july this year on the grounds that he had breached his tenancy agreement			1
he was also ordered to pay off £ 5,695 in rent arrears			0
@entity11 had 28 days to appeal - but that time ran out yesterday			1
he is believed to still be serving his sentence and the eviction took place in his absence			0
@entity48 housing spokesman councillor @entity47 said : ' mr @entity11 ’s decision to involve himself in the shocking scenes of violence , looting and disorder that struck @entity53 in august 2011 , coupled with his wilful refusal to pay his rent , has resulted in him losing his council flat			1
' as a consequence , it is extremely unlikely he will be offered taxpayer subsidised social housing by any other council or housing association			0
he will have to stand on his own two feet and arrange his own accommodation from now on			0
' this is the price he must pay for his actions that night			0
robbery : @entity11 joined a mob that looted a branch of @entity14 in @entity16 during the trouble ' the date of today ’s eviction is nothing more than pure coincidence , but it does serve as a timely reminder that here in this borough we make no apology whatsoever for taking a tough stance with those who choose to engage in serious criminality			1
' we have no room on our estates for looters , rioters and those who refuse to pay their rent			0
' a council spokesman said : ' when a tenant is given the keys to a council property in @entity48 they must sign a binding agreement that neither they nor any of their household members will engage in criminal or anti-social behaviour anywhere in the borough , or commit any acts that that cause fear , harassment or nuisance to other people living in the area			0
' failure to abide by this tenancy agreement renders them liable to eviction			0
' in parallel , the council ’s finance department was also seeking mr @entity11 ’s removal from the property as a result of his rent arrears , which now stand at £ 5,695			2
' the judge ordered mr @entity11 to pay these off without delay			2

@entity11 was evicted from his @entity21 flat by @entity18
he had been part of a mob that burgled a @entity14 branch in @entity16 in 2011
