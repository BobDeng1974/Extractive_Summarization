@entity1 customers have accused the retailer of cutting back on shoe quality , while failing to lower prices			1
after newsletter subscribers were alerted that the $ 125 @entity6 , which was discontinued in early 2014 , had returned last week both in the brand 's @entity9 and @entity10 stores , customers immediately began noticing differences in the new shoes			1
the blog @entity15 pointed out that the ballet flats , still priced at $ 125 - and an even pricier £ 125 in the @entity10 - are no longer made in @entity17 , and customers have described their ' disappointment ' on @entity1 's website			1
new @entity20 : after newsletter subscribers were alerted that the $ 125 @entity22 , which was discontinued in early 2014 , had returned last week , customers immediately began noticing differences in the new shoes a woman from @entity24 ordered a pair of her beloved @entity20 ballet flats in red leather and said she noticed differences ' immediately '			1
' [ they are ] overly wide at the center , no reinforcing leather strip up the heel , a pieced sole rather than a solid one , 1/2 to 3/4 inch lower at the top of the heel			0
' the resulting quality and fit are poor ... excessive width makes them difficult to keep on when walking , the lower - hitting heel results in my heel slipping in and out , the original interior wedge has been replaced with an interior bump at the instep			2
' another customer notes that her new @entity48 loafers are no longer made in @entity17 either ; now , they 're made in @entity49			1
and for one anonymous reviewer who said she ' does n't care where it 's made , ' but she does ' care about the quality ' , the new @entity20 flats are unsatisfactory			1
old @entity20 : made in @entity17 , customers say the original @entity20 ballet flat was of much higher quality , and far superior in comfort ' [ they are ] not as buttery soft as before and stretches out too easily			1
it 's also cut wider and falls off the back of my feet , ' she wrote			0
to prove their point , @entity15 compared the shoes ' old and new descriptions from @entity1 's online store			2
' new : we resurrected one of our most popular ballet flats from the @entity1 archives — and for good reason			0
with a cushioned insole for maximum comfort , a rubber sole for maximum flexibility and an elasticized topline so they hug your feet just so , they feel as good as they look			0
' old : beautifully styled in sumptuous suede ( from @entity17 , of course )			2
our designers deliberated over every detail to ensure our ballets are the most comfortable you 'll ever wear , adding more padding , removing the shank and finishing them with an arch - hugging wedge			0
we think they 've nailed it			0
' however a @entity1 representative said the company has n't changed anything about the shoe			0
in fact , the retailer told @entity101 that the new @entity102 flat is made with the same last , same sock , same upper , same materials , and same fit – the only difference being , it said , is that a pull tab in the back of the shoe , which customers said was causing discomfort , was removed .			0

the @entity22 , which was discontinued in early 2014 , has been made available again in the brand 's @entity9 and @entity10 stores
but customers have *complained* that the shoes are no longer made in @entity17 and have *criticized* their ' poor quality '
