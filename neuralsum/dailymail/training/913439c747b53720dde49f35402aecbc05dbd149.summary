@entity0 planned to welcome back an old friend on sunday when @entity2 was due to join them at their practice at the @entity6 for his first involvement with the national team since he limped away from the 2009 ashes			1
@entity2 ’s extraordinary comeback , which started with @entity11 last season and extended to the @entity14 team , now includes him putting in an appearance at @entity0 ’s practice ahead of their tri-series game against @entity18			1
before anyone gets too carried away it should be stressed that @entity2 has been asked to join the @entity0 team by coach @entity22 not to bowl but to chat to the younger players and allow them to pick his brains			2
@entity2 , pictured playing for the @entity14 , will join @entity0 for a practice session on sunday @entity2 bays during the @entity28 match between the @entity14 and @entity29 @entity2 remains one of the best death - ball bowlers in international one - day cricket over the last 20 years it is felt that @entity2 , who has hinted that his comeback will come to an end after the @entity14 is concluded next week , will be a positive presence for a young @entity0 team still rebuilding after the upheaval of the last year			1
it is unclear whether @entity2 , who has struggled to make an impression with @entity40 , was going to take part in training but he remains one of the best death bowlers in one - day cricket of the last 20 years and could surely pass on a tip or two			0
the appearance of one of the legends of the @entity49 would give @entity0 a boost after their defeat in the tri-series opener against @entity53 and with them now desperately needing to beat @entity18 at the @entity6 on tuesday			2
@entity54 ( left ) walks off after being dismissed during @entity0 's opening tri-series loss to @entity53 they received another setback yesterday when it was revealed that @entity59 broke the little finger of his right hand during fielding practice in @entity63 ahead of the tri-series against @entity53 and @entity18			1
while it must be considered unfortunate that a player who has not featured in the first three games of this tour should pick up an injury @entity0 will not replace @entity59 even though he is unlikely to be fit for the rest of the tri-series			0
@entity0 are confident that their reserve batsman will be fit for the @entity72 so will give @entity73 every chance to cement his place at @entity76 rather than rush in a replacement player just for the last three matches of this series			0
@entity2 holds the 2005 ashes aloft following the @entity83 test match after the famous series @entity85 , @entity0 's one - day captain , top scored during the loss to @entity53 with 121 runs someone who still maintains he would welcome a call - up , unlikely though it is , is @entity90 , who yesterday became the highest scorer in the @entity94 @entity93 competition this season when he hit 67 from 42 balls in @entity98 victory over @entity99			1
yet there was no rush here to call in @entity90 to a net session as @entity22 and @entity104 , who extended the invitation , have done with @entity2			0
meanwhile @entity106 , the county champions , face a battle to keep hold of their highly rated coach @entity110 as it emerged that @entity53 want to take the former @entity53 fast bowler home to @entity114			0
@entity110 has been an outstanding success at @entity116 and is settled in @entity117 with his family but will face a severe test of his loyalty to his adopted county if @entity53 follow up their interest with a firm offer			0
@entity0 batsman @entity59 has fractured his finger but will play in the forthcoming @entity72 @entity126 ( left ) appeals unsuccessfully for the wicket of @entity128 , who went on to reach a century			2

@entity2 will join an @entity0 practice session on sunday
*ex-england* all *rounder* will offer *advice* to young bowlers at the @entity6
@entity59 has broken his finger and will miss remainder of tri-series
@entity0 play @entity18 in @entity40 in second *odi* of series on tuesday
@entity90 *smashed* 67 not out for @entity98 on *saturday*
