honeymoon : the couple were staying at the @entity72 , where their car and belongings were found mystery : the couple took these pictures of each other in front of their cabin at the @entity72 just before they went missing ' this is a true , 60 - year - old story that has all the elements of many mysteries , docudramas and other headline - grabbing stories , ' @entity42 said in a written compilation of newspaper articles and court records			2
the couple had married on may 22 in @entity93 and were on a two - week honeymoon			2
they were reported missing from @entity72 where they had been staying after they had been absent a few days and their car was found in a parking lot near @entity99			1

the only explanation their families could think of was that they had changed their minds			0
@entity42 has worked on many hypotheses			0
did they escape unknown problems to another country ? did they have underworld ties in @entity93 and knew too much ? or did they simply die in the boating accident , having decided at the last minute to board the ship , and still lie somewhere at the bottom of the lake ? at around 2pm on may 28 , 1954 , a sudden , violent storm threw the @entity45 on its back , depositing all of its passengers in the water			1

@entity42 recently spoke to @entity147 , the pilot of the @entity45 on the day of the accident			2
