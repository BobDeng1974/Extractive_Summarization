@entity0 got the job done at the weekend and now i think we are about to see @entity5 ’s next great world champion			1
he is going to get what i believe he deserves – that title shot			1
we were told by the @entity8 last week that they have ruled on @entity9 , their champion			1
with @entity9 fighting @entity12 on april 19 , both men must now sign an agreement with the @entity8 that the winner will fight @entity0 within 90 days			1
before july 19 , i expect him to have his shot and to be a world champion			1
dominant : @entity0 thrashed @entity17 at the @entity18 in march date with destiny : the @entity21 boxer is set to earn a long - awaited @entity23 shot like i wrote in a previous column , this is a guy who has had nothing but bad luck when it has come to world title shots			1
the postponements of his fight with @entity33 devastated him			1
i was with him watching @entity33 ’s fight with @entity9 when @entity33 lost and with it went @entity0 ’s scheduled title challenge			1
the look on his face			2
now he is going to get what he deserves and i promise you it will be special			2
this guy has as much talent as any @entity5 fighter			0
when he is properly motivated he will beat anyone			0
the fight against @entity17 was designed to blow away the cobwebs and break up his camp for the title shot			1
now he will go straight back into training			0
who will he face ? it ’s a tough one			2
you have to say @entity9 is the favourite , but if it ’s @entity12 who wins then i think a fight between him and @entity0 is big enough to hold here in the @entity5			1
i am keeping my fingers crossed on that one			0
trio : @entity12 ( left ) has fought @entity63 ( right ) and @entity64 and could soon face @entity65 frustration : @entity0 had been due to fight @entity66 @entity33 for a world title @entity68 is one of my favourite fighters			1
he has had it hard , but he has as much heart as anyone in the sport			0
he won on saturday and so we are looking at getting him that third shot at a world title			1
i am sure he is destined to win one and when he does it will make all the struggling worthwhile			0
i think the biggest step has already been taken and that was moving him from light heavyweight to cruiserweight			0
at the weigh - in on friday he was 14st @entity86 – about a stone and a half more than what he used to weigh in at			0
he will be a real force at cruiserweight and i am already in discussions with @entity93 about a potential fight with @entity97 champions @entity95			2
he is ranked with the @entity99 and @entity97 so we are looking at title shots down both avenues and we always have an eye on @entity104			2
trilogy : @entity68 is set to receive another world title shot after his win at the @entity18 on saturday @entity108 : @entity68 beat @entity110 @entity109 in a cruiserweight bout in @entity112 losing to @entity104 hurt @entity68 and he ’d love another go at him			1
that would be another huge domestic fight and i think it would have a different result at this weight			2
@entity68 is such a lovely guy and he works so hard because he wants it so badly			1
at light - heavyweight he was a different person almost			0
he would get down to that weight and he would be a shell of himself and i also feel that he was n’t given a full apprenticeship before he fought @entity104			0
the fights he has had since , like @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 , he should have had before he was put in with @entity104			0
now we are getting him the right apprenticeship at this weight			0
seeing him last week at this weight , he is so much more comfortable			0
he has a bit of work to do on his body , but he has enough power to blow anyone away at this weight			0
he is a happier fighter , a better fighter and with one more fight i think he will be ready for @entity95			2
i will deliver him that third title shot and i am confident it will be third time lucky ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... i can reveal here that @entity146 will return to the ring on june 27 in @entity148			1
i am still looking at opponents but i can tell you i am talking to the likes of @entity153 champion @entity152 , the @entity153 champion , and @entity155 , who holds the @entity8 belt , and @entity99 champion @entity157			1
i am also looking at the winner of the big domestic fight between @entity160 and @entity161 next month			1
i might have wanted to pitch @entity64 back in at a slightly lower level after he lost his title against @entity164 , but @entity64 wants a title and is demanding a big fight			2
i will give him one			0
@entity167 will be on the undercard – they love him up there			0
back in action : @entity172 will return to the ring on june 27 in @entity148 in terms of @entity176 and @entity177 , we are getting into the nitty - gritty now			1
we sold 60,000 tickets in a ridiculous time and i am told that we could have sold 100,000 tickets for this fight			2
100,000 ! my hope now is to sell a further 20,000 a couple of weeks down the line , but first i need to have some discussions with @entity187 about the curfew times and a few details			0
i am confident that will be resolved quite quickly and we will end up with 80,000 fans at ringside for what will be the biggest fight in the history of @entity5 boxing			2
interest : around 60,000 tickets were sold for @entity176 's rematch with @entity177 inside an hour grudge : the @entity198 won the first meeting between the pair with a controversial stoppage @entity202 might seem like an easy sell – it ’s certainly a lot easier than selling double glazing			1
when i was about 16 , i used to leave college and go straight to a double glazing firm in @entity209 from 6pm to 8pm every night			0
i used to have go through the phone book and randomly call everyone i could , trying to get permission for our guys to go round and give them a quote			0
when you get rejected 99 times out of 100 , it makes you realise how tough it can be to sell things			0
thankfully , with @entity176 and @entity177 we have a product that is a bit easier to shift			1
i ’ll never get complacent because i do n’t want to sell windows again !			0
