the high street camera chain , which has 187 stores , is the first of what is expected to be many retail casualties in 2013			1
the shops will not re-open and about 1,370 store staff will lose their jobs immediately			1
the rest , who work at @entity1 ’ @entity18 headquarters , are likely to follow soon afterwards			2
no hope : administrators @entity20 have announced that all 187 branches of camera chain @entity1 will close with the loss of 1,370 jobs customers who bought products in the run - up to @entity28 will be unable to get repairs or refunds on faulty goods and gift tokens will not be honoured			1

@entity20 ( @entity20 ) were appointed earlier this week after it became clear @entity1 had effectively run out of cash			2

@entity20 's @entity48 said : ' since my appointment , we have reviewed the position of the business and held extensive discussions with suppliers around their support for ongoing trading			1
closed : every branch of @entity1 , including this one in @entity59 , will shut for good at the end of trading today with customers unable to return goods ' it is apparent that we can not continue to trade and as a result we have had to make the difficult decision to begin the closure of all 187 @entity1 stores at the close of business today			1
' regrettably , this will result in around 1,370 job losses across the stores with further job losses likely , in due course , at the head office in @entity18			1
' the stock will be collected over the coming days and returned to a central warehouse			0
' it will be returned to suppliers if they are entitled to it			0
' as a consequence of the closure , @entity1 is no longer able to accept returned product from customers			1
' this is an extremely sad day for @entity1 and its employees			0
' we are very grateful for the support we have received since our appointment and we will continue to ensure that employees are paid as they assist us during the closure			0

forecasts for 2013 had indicated the decline would continue , @entity20 added			1

mr @entity48 said discussions to raise additional financial support had been held between the directors , lenders and suppliers over the past few days			0
but the directors had appointed administrators in light of ‘ irreconcilable differences ’			1
1935 - @entity1 started trading when @entity130 opened his first store in @entity18 selling 16mm cine films			2
the business expanded significantly when @entity130 ’s son @entity134 came on board , and set about transforming it into a cut - price retailer of photographic equipment			2

the chain was launched in 1935 by @entity130 , who opened the first photography store in @entity18			0
but the firm has had a rocky few years			0
it managed to avoid administration in 2009 after its bank wiped out its debts in return for a 47 per cent stake in the business			2
a number of household names – @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , blacks , @entity189 , @entity190 , and @entity191 – all went into administration in 2012 and the @entity193 has warned the pattern could continue into 2013			2
@entity193 director general @entity195 said : ‘ if you look at the amount of money people have got in their pockets , that is expected to continue to be under pressure			0
’ @entity1 is the latest of several household names that has fallen into administration in recent months as struggling families cut down on spending			0
the number of @entity209 chains going bust has increased by almost a fifth in two years , figures released last week showed			1
some 194 stores and chains fell into administration during 2012 , compared to 183 in 2011 and 165 during 2010 , according to data from @entity216			2
everything must go : last year saw the demise of @entity187 , left , and @entity185 , right , among others , as consumers cut back on their spending in 2012 last year saw the demise of @entity185 , @entity187 and @entity190 , with @entity191 , blacks and @entity189 also entering administration			0
but the number going under in the run - up to @entity28 dropped , with 37 chains folding in the final three months of 2012 , compared with 42 in the same period in 2011			0
the closure of @entity1 stores has marked the first high profile retail collapse of 2013 , with others certain to follow			1
online retailer @entity232 is to shut down its retail business and become solely a marketplace for other retailers from march			2
the @entity157 - based company blamed the end of the @entity239 loophole which allowed items under £ 15 to be sold to the @entity38 vat free from the @entity242 .			1

administrators announced that all 187 stores across the @entity38 will close for good at end of trading today
