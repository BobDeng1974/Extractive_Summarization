by @entity0 @entity1 : 04:59 est , 25 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:22 est , 25 december 2013 the scandal which targeted prime minister @entity5 's allies has become one of the worst political crises in 10 years three cabinet ministers have resigned in @entity9 days after their sons were arrested in a sweeping corruption and bribery scandal			1
the scandal which targeted prime minister @entity5 's allies has become one of the worst political crisis in 10 years			1
@entity16 , the environment and urban planning minister , announced his resignation in an interview today			2
it came hours after economy minister @entity22 and interior minister @entity23 both denied any wrongdoing as they stepped down			1
their sons , along with the chief executive officer of the state - run bank @entity27 , are among 24 people who have been arrested on bribery charges			1
@entity16 's son was detained as part of the corruption probe but later released from custody			2
media reports said police have seized $ 4.5 million in cash that was stashed in shoe boxes in the home of the bank 's ceo , while more than 1 million dollars in cash was reportedly discovered in the home of @entity46 's son , @entity45			0
@entity5 has denounced the corruption probe as a plot by foreign and @entity9 forces to thwart his country 's growing prosperity and discredit his government ahead of local elections in march			2
his government has won three successive elections since 2002 on the strength of the relatively robust economy , a clean image and a promise to fight corruption			0
@entity9 commentators believe the probe is fallout from an increasingly public feud and power struggle between @entity5 's government and an influential @entity68 based @entity67 cleric , @entity66 , whose followers are believed to have a strong foothold within @entity9 's police and judiciary			1
the two men , without naming each other , have been engaged in a war of words since the corruption probe was launched on december 17			0
as he resigned on wednesday , @entity22 questioned the legitimacy of the investigation , which is focusing on alleged illicit money transfers to @entity81 and alleged bribery for construction projects			2
' it is clear that the operation is a dirty conspiracy against our government , our party and our country , ' he said in a brief statement			0
' i am leaving my position at the economy minister to spoil this ugly plot , which has involved my colleagues and my son , and to allow for the truth to be exposed			1
' @entity9 's economy minister @entity22 , ( right ) interior minister @entity23 , ( centre ) and @entity101 affairs minister @entity102 ( left ) @entity46 , the interior minister , said that he is the victim of a political plot and that there is nothing his family could not account for			1
he also said alleged wiretap recordings of a conversation with his son - reportedly used as evidence by police for the arrests - were tampered with , and that the cash discovered in his son 's house was money earned from the sale of a luxury villa			0
the opposition had long called for the two ministers to resign , claiming their sons were taking bribes on behalf of their fathers , and insisted they should not remain in positions where they were able to influence the probe			0
the government already has dismissed dozens of police officials either involved in the investigation or thought to be linked to @entity66			0
journalists have been barred from entering police buildings , fuelling accusations from critics that the government is trying to impede the probe			0
the investigation is one of the biggest political challenges @entity5 's government has faced , including last summer 's nationwide anti-government protests over a development project in a beloved @entity143 park .			1
