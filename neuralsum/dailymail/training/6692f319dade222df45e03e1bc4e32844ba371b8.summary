the release of @entity2 ’s updated autobiography has confirmed his status as one of the most intriguing players of the @entity7 era			1
the revisiting of his feud with sir @entity11 , that leg breaking tackle on @entity12 and a bust up with @entity14 have made the headlines			2
but the book has also recalled just how powerful a presence he was at @entity19			1
the fearsome @entity20 was a true midfield general , enforcing @entity11 ’s will on the pitch , winning the ball , carrying it forward and pulling everyone around him into line			2
here , @entity26 considers @entity2 and some of the other most influential players in the 22 - year history of the @entity7			1
@entity36 now in his 17th season as a professional at @entity40 , @entity36 ’s longevity is testament to his talent and unwavering dedication to football			1
he has not always conducted himself well – appearing on the front pages of the papers as well as the back , but his ability as a footballer is unquestionable			0
he has an uncanny sense of positioning , rarely misses a tackle and last season made a staggering 600th @entity7 appearance			1
@entity36 is in his 17th season at @entity40 - he emerged from the academy to become a true leader 9			1
@entity57 the 34 - year - old has been criticised by some this season with @entity60 not firing on all cylinders			1
but there is no doubt that he has been consistently the most influential player at @entity65 since making his @entity7 debut in 1998			1
he cemented his status as a @entity60 legend when driving his side to @entity71 glory in @entity72 nine years ago			0
he is an expert passer and has reinvented himself in recent years , leading his team from a deep - lying midfield role			0
his desire to succeed for his boyhood team remains undiminished			0
@entity57 , celebrating scoring against @entity78 in 2009 , has excelled for @entity60 since 1998 8			1
@entity79 @entity79 spanned two eras at @entity81 , which can be summed up by his diet			0
the @entity83 years were sausage sandwiches			0
after the @entity86 arrived , it was lean meat and pasta but @entity79 was still at the forefront of the new @entity81			0
a strong and commanding defender , he was an inspirational leader , encouraging the best from his troops like a wartime general			0
fittingly , @entity81 won the double in the 2001 - 02 season , @entity79 ’s final year at the club where he spent his entire career			0
@entity79 finished his superb @entity81 career with a double in the 2001/02 season 7			0
@entity101 @entity101 racked up 963 appearances and 34 trophies over 24 seasons as a @entity19 player before retiring at the end of last season			1
he scored in 21 consecutive seasons and hit 109 league goals			0
the numbers speak for themselves			0
but few of @entity101 ’s many opponents over the years describe him as anything but humble			1
although his powers waned over the years and his runs became less blistering , he was still an influential presence in the @entity19 dressing room			1
@entity101 racked up 963 appearances for @entity19 and was still going strong in his final year 6			1
@entity118 even when not permanently signed to a @entity7 club , @entity118 continues to be influential on loan for @entity121			1
but it is 13 glittering years at @entity40 , which took in the most dominant period in the club ’s history , that earn him a place on the list			2
born into a footballing family , what marked @entity118 out was his magnificent work ethic			2
he worked tirelessly and consistently – delivering quietly impressive performances and goals season - after - season for @entity40 and in this campaign became the first player to score against 39 different @entity7 sides			1
as he gets older , he has n’t been afraid to adapt , sitting back more and exerting his influence in different ways			0
@entity118 helped @entity36 , more so with his goals , to three @entity7 titles in 13 years 5			1
@entity2 sir @entity11 broke the @entity142 transfer record to buy @entity2 from @entity143 – the £ 3.75m proving a bargain for the man who succeeded @entity146 as @entity19 ’s driving force			1
for what he offered the @entity7 in entertainment value , @entity2 was absolutely priceless			1
amid all the controversy and fallings out , he defined an era at @entity19			2
he was driven by a need to win and helped instill that hunger in the rest of the team			2
his rivalry with @entity32 was captivating			0
@entity2 succeeded @entity146 as @entity19 's driving force and proved to be a bargain at £ 3.75m 4			1
@entity159 simply the most lethal finisher in @entity7 history and all time top scorer with 260 goals , almost all celebrated with that famous one arm salute			1
his goals lifted @entity167 to the title in 1995 and a year later signed for his beloved @entity169 for £ 15m , a world record signing at the time			2
@entity159 was also completely nerveless , scoring 56 @entity7 penalties – the most of any player , by some distance			1
@entity159 celebrates scoring one of his 260 @entity7 goals ... his record still stands 3			1
@entity32 when his former team - mates speak of @entity32 , one word crops up repeatedly – respect			0
the former @entity181 star engendered respect with his brutal , battling midfield performances			0
@entity32 let the opposition know - he had an impeccable tactical awareness and during his nine years at @entity186 employed him as his brains on the pitch			0
@entity32 , avoiding a carton of drinks after scoring against @entity191 , was a giant figure for @entity81 2			0
@entity193 @entity193 had a slow start to @entity7 life , failing to score in his first seven games			2
but he picked up with a vengeance and boasts the second best minutes to goal ratio ( one every 121.8 minutes ) of any player to grace the top flight			2
the @entity86 is the gold standard for strikers , tearing through defences with ease and making scoring goals seem so utterly effortless			0
in the @entity81 invincibles side that went uniquely unbeaten in the 2003/04 season , @entity193 was the shining star			0
@entity193 - one of the best finishers in @entity7 history - scoring past @entity210 of @entity211 1			2
@entity212 in late november 1992 , the @entity86 strutted into @entity213 with his chest puffed out and went on to shape the future of @entity19			2
he made an instant impact in a side that had n’t won a title in 26 years , helping them to win eight and draw two of his first 10 games			0
he helped @entity19 win four titles over his five years there , making goals , scoring and beating players in a fashion not seen before in @entity230 football			1
he had his controversial moments as well - such as when he kicked a spectator at @entity233 in 1995			0
but he made much more of an impact on the pitch			0
what more to say about @entity212 ? he arrived with a swagger , which never disappeared			0

@entity2 releases updated autobiography , with several talking points
also *reminded* us what an influential player he was at @entity19
@entity36 and @entity118 helped @entity40 to three titles
@entity159 is the @entity7 's record *goalscorer*
@entity57 and @entity101 two of the *greatest* midfielders
