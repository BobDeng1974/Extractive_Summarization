by @entity0 @entity1 does n’t know if he ’s upset too many people at the @entity3 to ever be considered for the @entity6 head coach ’s job			1
he does n’t particularly care			2
the @entity8 director of rugby has lost count of the number of times he ’s been ticked off by the authorities for bad behaviour — including two hefty bans for verbally abusing match officials — and the only people he worries about upsetting with his foul - mouthed tirades are his wife , @entity21 , and their young family			1
‘ my wife just looks at me and says , “ what have you done now ? ” ’ said @entity1			1
@entity8 director of rugby @entity1 wonders if he has ticked off the @entity3 too much to become @entity6 head coach @entity1 has won three @entity29 titles in his time at @entity8 ‘ my kids remind me when i ’m reprimanding them			1
they say , “ you say naughty words and on television as well dad ”			0
i have to hold my hands up			0
‘ i ’ve mellowed a bit and learned to control my temper			0
although i say that at the start of every season and then get in trouble , so maybe i ’ll take that back ! ’ with three @entity29 titles in five years , as well as a @entity46 final appearance , @entity1 has delivered enough silverware for the @entity49 giants to justify the touchline rants			1
he ’s second only to @entity51 at @entity52 as the longest - serving director of rugby in the @entity29			1
but the 43 - year - old , who made 262 first - team appearances for @entity8 as a player after signing from @entity58 in 1992 , still received plenty of stick this summer after the @entity8 failed to reach a play - off final for the first time in a decade			1
‘ doing this job you have to develop a thick skin , ’ he said			0
‘ being a director of rugby is often a thankless task , especially at a club like @entity8 where people expect you to win and if you do n’t you get a load of stick			1
@entity1 is second only to @entity51 at @entity52 as the longest - serving director of rugby in the @entity29 @entity74 made 27 appearances for @entity6 during his playing career ‘ so you just try to win because that ’s what people demand			1
you ’ll have to ask the @entity3 if i ’ve upset them too much ( to be @entity6 coach )			1
i ’ve never really been a career climber			0
i like going to work and doing what i do			0
where that takes me , i do n’t know			0
‘ all i care about is @entity8 and i ’m passionate about what i do			2
i make no apologies for that			0
some coaches are happy to sit there and watch and be more composed but i like to get involved in what ’s going on			0
i live every tackle and every pass			0
whether i grow out of it at some point , who knows ? i ’m a young 43 and i want to win			2
’ last season @entity8 did n’t win enough			2
after failing to make a mark in @entity97 and losing to @entity52 in the @entity29 play - off semi-final , the flak flew over the summer , with @entity99 and @entity100 two of the high - profile ex-players to get stuck in			1
@entity99 argued skills coach @entity102 should be given more involvement			2
@entity1 disagrees in typically forthright fashion			2
@entity1 ( centre ) lines up with @entity107 ( left ) and @entity108 ( right ) for @entity6 in 1998 ‘ @entity99 has got about as many brain cells as a bag of crisps , ’ he says with a grin about a former team - mate he released in 2010 after 14 years at the club			1
‘ he has no idea what @entity102 does			0
@entity99 has just been a little bit inaccurate but only out of not knowing what day of the week it is			0
’ today , @entity8 take on @entity118 at @entity119 on the back of a 36 - 17 opening - day win over @entity122			1
they will do so without club captain @entity124 , who is out for the season with a cruciate ligament injury			0
@entity1 is a hard - nosed realist			1
winning pays his bills , and @entity1 knows full well that if his team fail then the club he ’s served faithfully for the best part of 22 years — bar a two - year sabbatical in @entity135 — will sack him			1
‘ this is not just a job for me , ’ he said			0
‘ some of the cultures we have in place i helped create when i was a player in the 1990s			2
i care deeply about the club			0
‘ but as we ’ve seen with @entity143 and @entity144 , there are lots of coaches who ’ve been players and been at @entity8 a lot longer than i have who , when their time is up , their time is up			2
‘ the minute you ca n’t keep the club moving in a forward fashion is the moment you will get the tap on the shoulder			0
