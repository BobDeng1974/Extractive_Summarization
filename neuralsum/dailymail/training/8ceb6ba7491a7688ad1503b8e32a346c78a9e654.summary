by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 19:03 est , 22 august 2013 cold comfort : turning your washing down to 30c could allow germs to thrive you may think you are doing your bit for the environment			1
but if you ’re following the current trend of turning down the temperature on your washing machine to 30c , you could be doing yourself harm			1
new research has shown that potentially dangerous bacteria in our laundry are not killed off in low - temperature washes			1
they breed in the machine , and are passed on to future loads			2
hygiene expert dr @entity19 says : ‘ studies show that a build - up of bacteria in the interior of a washing machine transfers to the wash water of subsequent cycles — with as many as one million bacteria in just two tablespoons of water			1
‘ low - temperature washing provides optimal conditions for germs to multiply			1
’ but manufacturers of washing machines and detergents are pestering us to lower temperatures to 30c , claiming it will save us money — and the planet			1
so , is the cool wash just another eco-con ? is it putting your health at risk ? and what temperature should you be washing your clothes at ? we investigate			1
@entity47 does hot mean clean ? ‘ higher temperatures clean clothes more hygienically because when the water is hot , the cotton yarns swell up and forcibly release the soiling , ’ says laundry expert dr @entity49			0
as for the current craze for a cool wash , he is emphatic : 30c cycles simply wo n’t clean your clothes properly			0
‘ in fact , 30c is actually the temperature in which we incubate bugs to grow them for our experiments , ’ he explains			1
‘ oily skin sebum — the yellow mark you see on shirt collars and underarms — is a protein and breeds bugs that most detergents wo n’t kill at such cool temperatures			0
‘ in order to clean polyester cottons thoroughly , they need to be washed at a minimum of 65c for ten minutes			0
for pure cottons it is 71c for three minutes , which kills pretty well all viable micro-organisms			0
‘ if you ’re doing a normal family wash and no one has any infectious diseases , this does n’t really matter			0
your family all share germs anyway , and it ’s unlikely you ’ll get ill. but if one of the household works in , say , healthcare or the catering industry , it ’s vital their work clothes are thoroughly cleaned			1
’ germs that are passed on through minuscule spores — from the hospital superbug @entity98 ( @entity98 ) and the food - poisoning bug @entity100 , which is found in products that have been left to sit around for too long , like rice , right up to the lethal anthrax bacterium — have a good survival rate in anything other than the hottest temperatures , says dr @entity49			1
in a spin : will the eco-friendly cool cycle come out clean in the wash ? ‘ only autoclaving ( high - pressurised cleaning with steam ) at 150c for about ten minutes will kill these , which is why anthrax is such a feared bioterrorist weapon , ’ he adds			1
meanwhile , dr @entity19 points out the problem of cross-contamination if the wash - setting is not hot enough			0
‘ i am very concerned about bacteria from underwear transferring on to items such as tea towels which are then used to wipe dishes , ’ she says			1
so , does this mean that no washing powder will kill these germs ? ‘ some products do incorporate a chemical disinfectant which can reduce the amount of bugs in the wash , ’ says dr @entity49 , ‘ but they are rarely available domestically			1
@entity135 is among the very few brands that does one ( @entity137 + , £ 22.50 , broschdirect.com )			1
otherwise you have to go to commercial laundry suppliers to get anything similar			0
if you have someone ill , elderly or with a low immune system at home , it might be wise to invest in an anti-bacterial detergent			0
’ if you ’re not using an anti-bacterial detergent or a hot temperature , you are relying on simple dilution with water to disperse bugs , says dr @entity49			2
‘ with proper dilution , you can reduce the number of bugs from one million per square inch to around 10 - 20 per square inch , but in a normal washing process you do n’t use nearly enough water			0
the only way to really kill germs is to wash at a higher temperature			1
’ just how many germs are in your machine ? while a 30c cycle wo n’t technically damage your washing machine , it can lead to a build - up of grease or black mould on your machine door or inside the detergent drawer			1
and some estimates say the average washing machine contains 100 million @entity175 bugs at any one time			1
dr @entity49 says : ‘ germs may be lurking in your machine if you only ever do cool washes			2
if you smell a rotting smell coming from your machine , you may want to think about doing a very hot wash — say , 90c — to sterilise it			0
’ nature fresh ? biological washing powders are much better at killing germs in cooler washes consumer experts at which ? suggest doing at least one hot wash a month ( 60c minimum ) and leaving the machine door ajar after every load to allow it , and the rubber seal around it , to dry out			1
removing and cleaning the detergent drawer , and wiping around the rubber seal with light bleach cleaners will also reduce the ability of germs to breed			2
@entity198 ? by now , you ’re probably reaching for the 60c button on your washing machine			2
indeed , studies show that washing at 30c or even 40c kills just six per cent of house - dust mites , compared with 100 per cent at 60c			2
but be warned : even the 60c setting may not kill germs properly			1
why ? because some 60c settings simply do n’t get that hot			1
yesterday , which ? found that eight out of 12 popular washing machines failed to reach the correct temperature on a 60c wash			1
and none of the machines — which included @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 — kept the water hot enough for long enough to kill bugs such as @entity220 or the housemites that cause allergic reactions			2
in fact , one @entity214 machine ( the @entity224 - 80 ) only heated the water to 43c on its so - called 60c cycle			1
and most of the machines kept the water cooler than 50c for most of the wash programme			2
so you may have to go even higher than the 60 ° programme to make sure your wash is properly hot			0
which detergents are best at killing germs ? while hot washes are undoubtedly better than cool ones , there ’s one thing they ’re not good at : cleaning delicate fabrics			2
indeed , hot washes will destroy some fabrics such as silk , in which case an antibacterial additive needs to be put in the cooler wash			0
dr @entity19 says : ‘ @entity248 claims to kill 99.9 per cent of bacteria at low - temperature washes			1
and there ’s @entity252 , a treatment powder for cloth nappies , which i use with other items of clothing , not just nappies			0
’ other products that claim to sanitise clothes include @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263			0
according to fabric technologist @entity265 , biological powders work best at killing germs in cooler washes			2
out to dry : the @entity268 says ' economical ' cool washes will save you a total of just £ 13 per year ‘ they contain enzymes not present in non-biological detergents that break down stain particles , making them easier to wash off			1
at temperatures above 60 ° , the enzymes are killed off and the detergent is less effective			0
’ @entity265 says it ’s a myth that sensitive skins should avoid biological detergents			0
‘ if your machine rinses clothes properly , all traces of detergent should be removed , and they should be safe to wear against all skin - types			0
’ is a @entity289 ? many modern machines have ‘ quick wash ’ cycles that clean clothes in as little as 15 minutes , and the temperature never rises above 30c			1
dr @entity49 says : ‘ a quick rinse is fine if the clothes are only very lightly soiled with fresh perspiration			0
but this length of time and temperature setting wo n’t swell the yarns of the cotton , so any significant soiling will not be released			2
’ if you have a hot quick - wash cycle — 60c or above — it should kill most germs			1
so you can save time and be really clean			0
does washing at 30c @entity311 ? according to the @entity268 , the average washing machine is used for 274 cycles a year , using up to £ 63 - worth of electricity , depending on the model			1
machine and detergent manufacturers are keen to claim that consumers can use around 40 per cent less energy if they choose cool washes			0
but are the savings worth it ? @entity323 , an engineer who runs consumer website whitegoodshelp.co.uk , does n’t think so			0
‘ using 41 per cent less electricity by washing at 30c sounds impressive but , as always with percentage figures , you need some perspective to judge how useful they are			0
for example , 2p is 100 per cent more than 1p , but 1p is hardly astounding			0
’ he cites an example on a detergent advert that states : ‘ at 30c , the average energy consumed per wash was 0.284 kwh , while at people ’s normal wash temperatures , this was @entity338			2
’ @entity323 says : ‘ this means the saving in electricity by washing at 30c was on average 0.198 kwh			2
the average cost of electricity is 10p for using 1,000 watts in an hour ( @entity341 )			2
this means you will have saved just under half — 5p			0
the 41 per cent saving is only on this 5p , which works out at about 2p per wash			0
’ according to the @entity268 , the annual saving of cool washes is just £ 13 a year per household			1
@entity323 admits : ‘ any saving is good , and small savings add up			0
but it is not going to save a fortune			0
’ and it ’s certainly not going to kill off germs , either			2
additional reporting : @entity357 @entity356			0

bacteria and germs including @entity175 and hospital superbugs live in machines
many 60c settings never come near that temperature
cold cycle saves just £ 13 per year on average
