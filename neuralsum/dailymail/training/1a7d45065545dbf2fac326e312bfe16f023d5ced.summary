a trial testing an experimental @entity2 vaccine has been suspended amid concerns over potential side - effects			2
the decision to pause the @entity7 clinical trial at the @entity8 was taken after four volunteers reported suffering joint pain in their hands and feet			1
the hospital said the move is a ' precautionary measure ' , after the volunteers had the injection 10 to 15 days earlier			1
the @entity18 researchers reported on december 2 that the first people vaccinated with the experimental drug had experienced no serious side effects , with a few suffering a mild fever			1
but today , the hospital said the four patients had suffered joint pain , which lasted a few days			1
@entity27 vaccine expert @entity26 said the suspension of an ebola vaccine trial at the @entity30 is ' not a setback at all '			2
it was paused after four of 59 volunteers reported suffering joint pain in their hands and feet			1
the trial is set to resume in january in 15 volunteers , the hospital said scientists are racing to develop vaccines to combat the deadly virus , which has killed more than 6,300 people - the majority in the @entity44 nations , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
experts believe millions of doses of vaccine may be needed to bring this , the worst @entity2 outbreak in history , to an end and contain future epidemics			2
the global vaccines alliance , @entity57 , has today committed up to $ 300 million to buy any future vaccines			1
@entity57 , which is funded by governments and the @entity60 , said it is ready to begin procurement of a vaccine as soon as the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) recommends a drug for use			1
officials involved in the @entity7 trial of a drug developed by the @entity70 government and licensed to two @entity72 companies , @entity73 and @entity74 , said all 59 volunteers who received the jab are fine			1
' they are all fine and being monitored regularly by the medical team leading the study , ' the hospital said in a statement			0
the trial was started last month and is set to resume on january 5 in 15 volunteers after checks to ensure the joint pain symptoms were ' benign and temporary ' , the hospital said			1
the team was in close contact with researchers in the @entity72 , @entity89 , @entity70 and @entity90 who are carrying out the same trial with the @entity74 and @entity93 vaccine , it said			2
' these centres have not observed symptoms of inflammation in their volunteers to date , ' it added			2
@entity27 vaccine expert @entity26 , said the delay would allow time to see how widespread the problems are			0
scientists are racing to develop vaccines to combat the deadly virus , which has killed more than 6,300 people - the majority in the @entity44 nations , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 but it was expected that after the delay the trial will be able to continue as originally planned , she added			1
' it 's not a setback , not at all , ' she said in @entity18			2
and the @entity27 downplayed the setback , pointing out that temporary suspensions are not uncommon in clinical trials			0
researchers hope safe and effective vaccines will get a green light as soon as next year , although there is uncertainty over how well they will work and how many doses will be needed			0
last month @entity27 director general dr @entity124 said a vaccine to protect millions from @entity2 decades after the virus was first detected in the 70s , does not exist because the disease previously only affected poor @entity44 nations			0
the head of the @entity27 's scathing conclusion came at a point when nearly 5,000 people had lost their lives to the hemorrhagic fever			0
dr @entity136 criticized drugs companies for turning their backs on ' markets that can not pay '			0
she said the current outbreak - the most deadly in history - has exposed two @entity27 arguments ' that have fallen on deaf ears for decades '			0
the global vaccines alliance , @entity57 , has today committed up to $ 300 million to buy any future vaccines addressing the regional committee for @entity148 in @entity149 on november 3 , dr @entity136 said : ' @entity2 emerged nearly four decades ago			1
why are clinicians still empty handed , with no vaccines and no cure ? ' because @entity2 has historically been confined to poor @entity44 nations			0
' the r&d ( research and development ) incentive is virtually non-existent			0
' a profit - driven industry does not invest in products for markets that can not pay			0
' @entity27 has been trying to make this issue visible for ages			0
now people can see it for themselves			0
' but the money now earmarked by @entity57 will help to bridge the gap and is expected to be enough to procure up to 12 million courses of a vaccine			1
@entity27 vaccine expert @entity26 , said the commitment is ' fantastic '			0
in addition to helping tackle the current epidemic , the money could also be used to create stockpiles of @entity2 vaccines , similar to those that exist for yellow fever , meningitis and cholera			1
a further $ 90 million will be made available from @entity57 's funds to help those affected in the hardest hit nations , and introduce the vaccines while helping to rebuild their broken health systems			1
@entity57 , which was set up in 2000 with private and government donor backing , has a track record of bulk - buying vaccine supplies from manufacturers at a low price for the developing world			1
since 2000 , around 440 million children have been immunised against a range of diseases through its programmes			0
@entity57 said its board had decided to prepare for procuring @entity2 vaccines while still awaiting a green light for the first product , ' in light of the seriousness of the situation and the risks associated with delays in making a vaccine available '			2
two vaccines , one from @entity93 and @entity74 and a rival shot from @entity205 , are already undergoing human trials and third one , made by @entity208 , is about to enter clinical testing			0
' we 've had individual discussions with all of the manufacturers and continue to work closely with them , ' @entity57 's chief executive , @entity210 , said			2
@entity57 said it would meet the funding needs of the ebola vaccine programme using a combination of existing and new financing			2
it also plans to join forces with other initiatives that have already pledged funding to address the @entity2 crisis .			0
