lord @entity0 , a former first sea lord , complained that too many artworks in the @entity4 appeared to be of @entity6 battlefield defeats paintings in the corridors of @entity9 are ' a little mean ' because they all depict victories over @entity6 , a former head of the @entity13 has claimed			1
lord @entity0 , a former first sea lord , complained that too many artworks in the @entity4 appeared to be of @entity6 battlefield defeats			1
he called for the balance to be redressed , including a mural of the @entity18 to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the conflict this year			1
there are thousands of paintings , sculpture and murals dotted around the houses of @entity9 which form part of a priceless collection			1
the @entity29 near the @entity30 is dominated by two large 19th century paintings by the @entity33 artist @entity32			0
one fresco , ' @entity34 ' , depicts the moment @entity37 , was shot aboard @entity38 during @entity6 's defeat at the @entity40 in 1805			0
hanging opposite is ' @entity42 of @entity43 and @entity44 ' , which shoes the @entity43 and the @entity45 at the @entity47 inn before defeating @entity48 at the @entity49 in 1815			0
speaking in the @entity1 today , @entity0 said there was too much emphasis on @entity53 's triumphs over its great rival across the @entity55			1
the @entity56 said : ' i have noticed around the @entity4 that nearly all the paintings of battle seem to be us defeating the @entity6 , which seems a little mean			0
' we fought most nations in the world and i wonder in this centenary of the @entity18 could we maybe commission a mural representing something like @entity67 or the famous battle of @entity69 in 1918 , in time for that commemoration ? ' @entity71 , chairman of committees , replied : ' well , i 'm certainly going to duck that one			1
' commissioning of works of art is a matter for the @entity78 and fortunately that is one of the few domestic select committees in this @entity30 that i do n't chair , and i 'm very grateful			0
' after leaving the @entity13 , @entity0 was a security minister in @entity82 's government			2
he raised the issue of the artworks after conservative peer @entity85 joked that she would be dead before the @entity32 murals were restored			1
@entity71 said the condition of the @entity49 and @entity40 murals had been investigated during two research projects with the @entity91			2
he said results of the research showed there was an opportunity of achieving a ' very high level of restoration '			2
this painting of @entity43 and @entity44 on the defeat of @entity48 in 1815 by @entity32 hangs in the @entity29 in @entity9 lord @entity71 told @entity100 : ' the initial research is now complete and discussions will take place with the university 's staff over the summer about the next steps towards restoration			1
' @entity107 will consider a range of possible options in the autumn			0
' @entity111 replied : ' it 's now several years since i asked my original question on this subject , i should be dead before the damn thing is done			2
' she added : ' would i be right in assuming that the @entity29 is much admired and loved by everybody except possibly the @entity6 president ( and ) also for the fact it does show women on the battlefield and on fighting ships ? ' and i would be grateful if some speed can be shown in the reconstruction , if necessary , over painting i would have thought , so that we are even more proud of the @entity29 when the work is finished			2
' critics warned too many paintings in @entity9 were in need of restoration work after several years @entity71 replied : ' i certainly hope it wo n't be a matter of you looking down kindly on us when the time comes for them to be revealed in their original true glory or as close to their original true glory as we can get it			1
' i think the important thing is considering the national and international importance of these murals to get it right rather than to get it soon			0
' it 's a very challenging task to restore the paintings to as near to their original condition as possible			0
' one of the , i think , very heartening results of the research that was carried out was the original pigment beneath the various layers has survived much more successfully in the @entity29 than was the case in the robing room			0
' so we really do have the opportunity of achieving a very high level of restoration and i think we should make sure we do get it right			0
