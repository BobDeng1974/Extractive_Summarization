by @entity0 published : 18:54 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 18:54 est , 21 june 2013 it may not have been a @entity2 or a @entity3 , but @entity4 and @entity5 were proud of their successful fashion boutique			0
for six years , business had boomed at 25 ten while other shops in the recession - hit northern town of @entity12 closed			1
but now they have joined the exodus from the high street – forced out by sky - high business rates that saw them charged more than @entity2			1
@entity19 said that he and his wife 's store 25 ten was forced to close down by sky - high business rates they say they could no longer afford the £ 20,882 a year cost and were shocked to find that their bill was based on a valuation of £ 375 per square metre			1
it meant they were charged double the £ 189 per square metre that @entity2 pays , although the huge @entity35 department store ’s total bill is obviously far higher			1
‘ it is just wrong , ’ said mr @entity5 , 38 , whose boutique sells mostly to women aged 18 to 35 and has @entity38 , who plays @entity39 in @entity40 , among its customers			0
they had survived on @entity12 's main shopping street for six years before they received the bill ‘ any form of taxation has to be fair and equitable			1
@entity2 should not be paying a business rate charge which is half of what they are in @entity12			1
‘ it just can not be right			0
the business rates system is not fit for purpose			2
’ he and his 35 - year - old wife are moving 25 ten to @entity57 , three miles away , where their business rates will be substantially lower			1
the couple were not the only victims in @entity12 of the much - hated rates system – a nearby fish and chip shop has its rates based on a charge of £ 945 per sq m , five times higher than @entity2			1
mr @entity5 says hard - hit high street traders across the country are subsidising big @entity69 retailers			1
small firms say business rates – the commercial equivalent of the council tax – are forcing them out of business			2
for most , the rates bill is their third biggest expense , after rent and staff costs , and is regularly cited as the biggest hurdle they face			2
many are furious that , while ministers boast about cutting corporation tax , business rates are going up every year			2
dr @entity85 , director of policy at the @entity87 , said : ‘ we have long known that the business rates system is flawed			0
‘ it is a tax on business , even before you start trading , whether you are in a northern suburb or the heart of @entity69			1
the government can not ignore the plea [ to look again at the tax ] any longer			0
we need to see action			0
’ @entity12 mp @entity99 has called the system ‘ unfair ’ and said that ‘ it can not be right that @entity12 has to subsidise places like @entity103 and @entity35 ’			2
business rates were introduced in 1988 when the ill - fated poll tax replaced domestic rates			0
the system is notoriously complicated			0
it involves the government ’s @entity109 setting the value of the business based on its rentable worth per square metre			1
they were charged double the £ 189 per square metre that luxury store @entity2 pays this is then multiplied by the uniform business rate , an inflation - linked figure set by the government , to calculate the total bill			1
but because the valuation of a premises is based on zones – with the 20ft nearest the front window rated highest , followed by the next 20ft and so on – smaller shops are often disproportionately affected			2
values are set every ten years but the last , in 2010 , was calculated using data from april 2008 at the height of the property boom			0
and the next valuation , which could help businesses in areas where property prices and trade have slumped , has been put back from 2015 to 2017			0
the money is collected by local councils but paid directly to central government and is currently worth £ 27billion a year , the same as council tax			0
the @entity109 said : ‘ if the ratepayer thinks their rateable value does not reflect the rental value of the property , they should contact us to discuss it			0

for six years , business had boomed at 25 @entity12 's high street
but , they have been forced to close after they received a *massive* bill
shocked to find their bill is based on a valuation of £ 375 per square metre
@entity162 's is charged £ 189 per metre in the centre of @entity69
