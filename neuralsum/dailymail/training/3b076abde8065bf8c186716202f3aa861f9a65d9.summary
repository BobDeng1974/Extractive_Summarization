by @entity0 many little girls dream of owning their very own doll 's house , complete with tiny rooms and quaint model furniture			1
but when one little girl asked her father for a doll 's house , she was in for a long wait as the elaborate home created by her father took him more than three decades to complete			2
@entity13 , 69 , from @entity14 in @entity15 , took 35 years to finish the project , which is a replica of the @entity18 's 18th century @entity17			1
labour of love : @entity13 and his daughter @entity21 with the incredible doll 's house that took 35 years to build weighing a whopping 200 pounds and costing more than Â £ 13,000 , it has 13 rooms over three storeys including five bedrooms , library , kitchen , dining room , marble hall and a utility room			1
a remote controls the individually wired light switches , six of the 14 chimneys are linked to a smoke generator , both front and back doors have a doorbell , while in a modern twist , the home includes an @entity43 nano which powers the speaker in the music room			2
@entity46 , now aged 40 , was five years old when she asked her father for the doll 's house on christmas eve 1978			1
' my mum was tucking me in and i said i wanted a doll 's house from @entity52 , ' explains @entity21			1
' she said he had packed his sleigh and left the @entity55 but she went downstairs and mentioned it to my dad and he said he was going to build one			0
' devoted father @entity13 agreed but came up with a blueprint so ambitious , @entity21 says she began to lose hope of ever seeing it finished			1
proud : @entity13 based his blueprint for the impressive doll 's house on a stately home six miles from his house @entity21 , now 40 , with her longed for dollhouse which she though her father might never get around to completing and right , at around five years old when she first asked for one detailed : the drawing room contains real electric lights and a fire powered by a mini smoke generator ' i thought it would take a few years , ' says @entity21			1
' once he started it became very clear that was not going to be the case			0
' by the time i got to my teenage years , it had become a bit of a running joke - i used to say , " will it ever get finished ? " ' as an adult i could see there was progress			2
my dad always said i was incredibly patient			0
' but the years of slow progress were about to come to an end when @entity13 retired from his job as a city lawyer in the city in 2004			1
with a new role as a part - time consultant , the loving father was able to devote at least 35 hours a week to the project			2
@entity21 , who lives with her husband @entity96 , 38 , an electric engineer , in their five - bedroom home in @entity99 , @entity100 , joked : ' once he retired he swapped one full time job for another full time job			1
he would spend every day from 10am to 4pm in his workshop ' clever : the library is decked out in dark wood and has shelves filled with books as well as a globe intricate : the attic contains two servant 's bedrooms complete with jugs and bowls for washing imposing : a tiny cat sits in the main hallway of the house , which comes complete with a tiled floor despite the progress he was making , @entity21 says there were moments when her father 's temper almost got the better of him			1
' there was certainly lots of times he wanted to take a hammer to it because he was annoying him , ' she revealed			0
' he had to stop what he was doing and come back later			0
' by the time he finished it he was probably sick of the sight of it			0
he did not really appreciate it until a few weeks later when he saw it again			0
' the finished result , however , proved a stunning surprise			0
' it 's indescribable really , to spend that much of your life on one project , it 's a real token of love and dedication			0
' describing her friends ' reactions , she added : ' they think it 's absolutely amazing and a little bit eccentric			0
' they have never really seen a doll 's house like it			2
most people 's perceptions of a dolls house is a basic wooden @entity159 house			0
this is a real work of art. ' all there : the dining room has crystal port and wine decanters and a case of silverware waiting on the sideboard play : the nursery is packed with handmade toys , among them a rocking horse and a tiny @entity173 she added : ' i 've spent a couple of friday nights sitting with a glass of wine and just marvelling at it			0
' the 42 x 39 inch house now has pride of place in her home , although she did have to hire a van to bring it home from her father 's workshop			1
' it took four grown adults to lift it , ' explains @entity21			2
' my dad was sat in the back [ directing operations ] with a walkie talkie			0
' after getting it home , the family threw a party to celebrate its arrival and give @entity13 a chance to reflect on his achievement			1
' i was desperately proud of it , ' he revealed			0
' i thought , " wow , how stunning ! " ' but while @entity13 's doll 's house has proved a hit with his daughter , it might be the last one built by a family member			1
' my sister in law 's husband said he started building one , ' adds @entity21 , ' but he said he may as well give up now			2
' @entity215 : the master bedroom has its own bathroom which comes complete with 18th century fittings pride of place : the house is now the centrepiece of @entity21 's own home and has proved a hit with the whole family			1
