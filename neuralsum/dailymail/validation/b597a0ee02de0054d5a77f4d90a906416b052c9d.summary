need some help and inspiration deciding who to back at @entity3 ? @entity5 's @entity4 and @entity6 reveal their favourites while a group of racing enthusiast celebrities have also shared their tips for the @entity11 on day two			1
@entity4 - eight - time champion jockey and rider of 13 @entity11 winners @entity14 ( @entity16 ’ @entity15 , 1.30 ) this @entity18 - trained contender has long been on my radar and looks a horse of massive potential			1
beaten over a shorter distance at @entity24 over @entity25 — his hurdling debut — but has won his other three races this season with great authority			2
best odds : 12 - 1 @entity31 winning the @entity32 at @entity33 - on - @entity34 on february 6 @entity35 ( @entity36 , 2.05 ) one of the @entity38 hotpots of the week and looks a future @entity40 contender			1
won the @entity42 ’ @entity41 at last year ’s meeting and has won his two races as a novice chaser			2
the most recent of those was his authoritative three - length defeat of the highly - rated @entity49 in the @entity50 ’ @entity36 at @entity51 over @entity25			1
best odds : 6 - 4 @entity52 , ridden by jockey @entity53 , winning the @entity54 last year @entity56 tipsters got off to a stunning start on the opening day			1
@entity59 ( @entity60 ) and captain @entity61 ( @entity6 ) napped 8 - 1 @entity64 winner @entity62 , while @entity6 also landed his next best bet ( the @entity66 8 - 1 ) to complete an 80 - 1 double			1
@entity60 also picked winners @entity69 ( 2 - 1 ) , @entity70 ( 4 - 6 ) and @entity71 winner @entity68 ( 4 - 5 ) , while @entity4 went for the first two @entity73 ’ winners			1
@entity74 ( @entity75 , 2.40 ) rated by jockey @entity76 ( above ) as one of his best chances of the meeting			0
his boss @entity80 has to be respected here and this contender looks like he still could be a touch in front of the handicapper			0
best odds : 16 - 1 @entity86 ( @entity87 , 3.20 ) usually two quick runs might be a negative with the chance they have knocked the competitive edge of horse but @entity94 ’s reigning champion thrives on racing and there are very positive reports emanating from his @entity98 stable as he prepares to defend his crown			1
he looks to have put his injury problems behind him judging by his last time out @entity103 win			0
punters looking for a longer - priced each - way option should consider simply @entity106			2
best odds : 3 - 1 @entity107 ( right ) on the way to winning the @entity109 's @entity32 at @entity110 on january 17 , 2015 @entity111 - on the best each - way bets @entity74 ( @entity75 , 2.40 ) staying on really strongly when fifth in last year ’s shorter @entity113 and was on the mark over two miles three furlongs at @entity110 in december			1
that form has worked out well			0
this stiffer test looks likely to elicit even more improvement and he looks one of @entity80 ’ best chances of the week			0
she won this in 2005 with @entity124			0
best odds : 16 - 1 @entity125 ( @entity113 , 4.40 ) @entity128 trainer @entity127 was successful on the opening day of last year ’s meeting with @entity131 and , although that injured gelding has unfortunately not made it back the time , this stablemate looks a lively outsider			1
has won only one of his three hurdle races but his two defeats should not be held against him , especially last time out on bottomless ground at @entity141			0
best odds : 25 - 1 modus ridden by @entity145 winning the @entity146 at @entity3 last year @entity147 ( @entity148 , 5.15 ) eighth in this race last year and purposely saved for another crack at the prize by his @entity153 trainer @entity152			1
he reckons his contender is a much stronger more mature performer now so he can give the @entity38 , who dominate this race , a run for their money			0
best odds : 25 - 1 and the celebs ... here ’s who the celebs are backing in the @entity87			2
@entity163 - @entity165 pundit @entity166 sometimes it is best to let your heart rule your head and i am cheering for @entity166 to get 50,000 hearts racing			2
@entity173 racing pundit @entity175 has a fantastic course and @entity11 record and is also tactically adaptable			0
he can win held up or making the running			0
@entity181 pundit and former footballer @entity182 ( left ) has backed @entity86 for victory @entity185 footballer and pundit @entity86 looks to be back to his best and it ’s a tip i got from the horse ’s mouth – @entity192 ! @entity194 presenter @entity86 the signs seem really positive for him to defend his crown			0
@entity199 - @entity181 presenter @entity200 i am going to back him each way because i think this is a race that is ripe for an upset			2
@entity181 presenter @entity207 ( right ) is backing simply @entity106 in the @entity87			0

@entity4 sees winning potential in @entity210
@entity107 , @entity212 and @entity147 are top each - way bets on day two
