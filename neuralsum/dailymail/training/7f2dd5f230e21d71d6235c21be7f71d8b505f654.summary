by @entity0 , health correspondent experts believe the 10p - a - day statins will be offered to up to an extra five million patients prescriptions for statins have trebled in a decade , with nearly 60million doled out last year			1
the @entity7 now spends £ 100million a year handing out the pills to approximately seven million @entity9 , according to official figures			1
and this is set to rise further after next week , when it is thought that the health watchdog will urge @entity14 to offer many more patients statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes			1
@entity19 will publish guidance a week from tomorrow which is likely to tell doctors that anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease over the next decade should be prescribed the medication			0
experts believe the 10p - a - day drugs will be offered to up to five million additional patients as a result , taking the total to 12million			1
but many leading doctors remain sceptical about their benefits and point out that they could lead to type 2 diabetes and debilitating muscle pain			1
they warn many patients see them as ‘ magic pills ’ that allow them to gorge on junk food , wrongly assuming they will be protected from the ill effects			2
it has also emerged that six of the panel of 12 experts drawing up @entity19 ’s guidelines have financial ties to firms which make statins or similar drugs			1
figures from the @entity51 show 58.1million prescriptions for statins were handed out in 2013 , up from 55.4million in 2012 and 18million in 2003			2
dr @entity54 , a cardiologist and consultant at the @entity56 , said : ‘ for most patients taking these pills will not reduce their death rate			2
‘ what is the point ? then you have to add in the potential for side effects and what might happen to their quality of life			0
‘ what i see with my own patients is that they think they ’ve got the magic pill which is an excuse to gorge on junk food			0
’ dr @entity74 , of the @entity75 , who stopped taking statins after experiencing debilitating muscle pain , said : ‘ statins are very useful for people at high risk , those who have had a stroke or heart attack			1
‘ but to prescribe these drugs to those at low risk prompts a real concern we are over-medicalising and over-statinising @entity9			2
’ figures from the @entity51 show 58.1million prescriptions for statins were handed out in 2013 he added : ‘ statins definitely have side effects – that is what i have seen after 30 years of prescribing them as a gp			0
to say otherwise is just not true			0
’ the rise in prescriptions is partly due to an incentive scheme for @entity14 called the @entity100			1
it means that they can earn extra money for prescribing statins to patients who are seen as high risk for problems such as heart attacks and strokes			1
family doctors are urged to try to identify patients who may need the drugs when they come in for their @entity7 health check – a three - yearly health mot for those aged 40 to 74			1
at present , doctors are advised to offer the drugs to anyone with a 20 per cent risk of developing heart disease over the next decade			0
but next week ’s guidelines are expected to lower this threshold to a 10 per cent risk			0
@entity124 , of the @entity125 , said : ‘ the prescription of cholesterol - lowering medications has been increasing steadily for many years now			0
‘ this reflects the efforts that have been made to better identify people at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease through initiatives such as the @entity135 programme			0
‘ statins are one of the most studied medicines available today			0
they have been proven to be safe and effective and are vital in helping reduce people ’s risk of heart attack and stroke			0
’ the figures also revealed that the number of prescriptions for antidepressants has doubled in the last decade , from 27.7million to 53.3million last year			2
across the @entity7 last year , a total of 1.03billion prescriptions were handed out , up by nearly two - thirds in the last decade .			2

@entity7 spends £ 100million a year handing out statins to seven million people
number set to rise as @entity14 urged to prescribe pills to many more patients
experts say 10p a day drugs will be given to an extra five million patients
but *critics* say they can cause type 2 diabetes and debilitating muscle pain
