by @entity0 it 's a long way to the @entity3 play - offs but @entity4 will know his @entity5 are already producing title - winning performances after @entity8 came off the bench to stun @entity10 with two killer tries			1
any thoughts that their opening - day success against defending champions @entity13 was a flash in the pan were quickly dispelled with this impressive victory over one of the summer ’s busiest teams			1
@entity20 had bucked the trend among @entity23 regions by recruiting , and recruiting big , especially in the capture of @entity26 anchor @entity25 , all black lock @entity25 and @entity28 @entity27			1
@entity8 dives past the tackle of @entity10 's @entity30 to score his first try of the day @entity20 : a @entity32 ; a @entity33 , @entity34 ( @entity35 62 ) , @entity36 , @entity37 ; @entity38 ( @entity39 70 ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 54 ) ; @entity42 ( @entity43 70 ) , @entity44 ( capt , @entity46 65 ) , a @entity25 ( @entity47 70 ) , @entity48 ( @entity49 55 ) , @entity50 , @entity51 ( @entity52 65 ) , @entity53 , @entity54			2
pens – @entity38 ( 4 ) @entity56 : @entity57 ; @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity60 54 ) , a @entity61 , @entity62 ; @entity63 ( @entity64 65 ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 54 ) ; a @entity67 ( @entity68 55 ) , @entity69 ( @entity70 40 ) , @entity71 ( @entity72 40 ) , @entity73 , @entity74 ( @entity75 68 ) , @entity76 , @entity77 ( @entity78 75 ) , @entity79 ( capt )			1
tries – @entity62 , @entity80 ( 2 )			2
cons – @entity82 , @entity60 ( 2 )			2
pens – @entity65 ( 2 ) , @entity84 ( 2 )			2
referee : @entity86 ( @entity87 ) all three were on show here at the @entity89 but even their considerable presence could not disrupt the @entity5 ’ bright start to the season			1
a yellow card for @entity95 failed to halt the visitors ’ momentum as the finishing prowess of @entity66 and @entity99 proved decisive			1
@entity8 scored twice as a second - half replacement after @entity62 had put @entity56 on course for an opportunist win that sends them up to second place			1
@entity105 and @entity106 added a brace of penalties apiece to cancel out @entity30 ’s four converted efforts for the @entity20			2
and @entity4 will have been equally satisfied by the fact his men kept the likes of @entity33 at bay			2
‘ we knew this would be a tough game so we ’re delighted at this win , ’ said the head coach			1
‘ we showed a lot of character at a time when @entity10 were getting the momentum in the second - half when we were down to 14 men but we really stepped it up			2
‘ you could see that again when four of our players chased back after a @entity20 interception , even though the referee brought it back for an earlier penalty			2
‘ our bench made a big impact to help us get the two tries and that really got us in a comfortable position			1
‘ @entity138 really stuck to his task after coming off the bench having only recently converted to the tight - head side of the scrum			1
‘ we were more accurate than them , there was n’t a scrum during the whole time we had a man in the sin - bin			2
‘ we ’d love to be back in the play - offs , but we ’re only two games in with 20 to go and we know how hard it is to get a home semi-final			0
‘ the difference was that we took our opportunities from their mistakes whereas they did n’t			0
’ the @entity5 had been sent an early warning by @entity20 fly - half @entity30			0
the 22 - year - old , fresh from notching up 21 points against @entity159 , fly - hacked his own chip towards @entity161 deep in @entity56 territory but @entity163 was on hand with a last - ditch tackle			1
however , @entity56 ’s forwards were hasty at a maul and @entity30 kicked the opening points			1
pyrgos equalised with his opening effort and traded penalties again with @entity30 after @entity173 hooker @entity172 was twice penalised			0
the artificial surface at the @entity89 , coupled with ideal conditions for running rugby , made for an end - to - end spectacle			0
@entity30 ca n't stop @entity99 running in for his try after the ball was stripped from @entity181 but last season ’s beaten finalists showed the opportunism that saw them overcome @entity13 last weekend to claim the first try			1
@entity62 combined strength and speed to mark his return to the starting team with a try			0
the @entity192 wing robbed @entity181 of possession			0
that was no mean feat in itself given the powerful young centre has already been capped by @entity196			0
yet @entity62 is no lightweight either and showed a clean pair of heels as he thundered down the left - hand touchline , out - pacing the covering defence , to hand the @entity5 a 13 - 6 lead at half - time			0
@entity4 brought front - rowers @entity203 and @entity72 on for the second half in an attempt to stifle the driving prowess of 100 - cap @entity25			0
yet even that failed to bolt the doors as the @entity10 scrum shunted @entity56 ’s forwards off the ball to win a penalty , five metres inside their own territory , that @entity30 kicked			1
the tide appeared to be turning inextricably in the hosts ’ favour when replacement hooker @entity68 was binned , just moments after taking the field , as @entity56 ’s scrum threatened to implode under pressure			1
but @entity4 ’s men mustered their spirits and managed to round the wagons and survive the 10 - minute spell without further punishment			0
it was the display of potential champions and proved a turning point here in @entity10			0
@entity4 ’s forward replacements had precious little impact but the introduction of @entity66 and @entity60 on 54 minutes was to prove decisive			0
@entity8 , with his first touch , pounced upon a loose pass intended for @entity37 and raced into the corner			0
it was against the run of play but highlighted the gulf between the team ’s finishing abilities			0
@entity60 converted and added a further penalty to stretch @entity56 ’s lead to 11 points with just 17 minutes remaining			1
that lead impacted on @entity10 whose discipline deserted them amid the pressure of chasing the game			0
they conceded more penalties than any other team in the opening round of the season and that told once more five minutes later			1
it was only good news for @entity60			0
but it was his half - back partner @entity66 who delivered the knock - out blow on 70 minutes			0
@entity263 broke clear of the @entity10 defence on the left wing and found the 19 - cap international in space and he saw off the scrambling @entity20 defence to wrap the game up			0
the hosts continued to bully the @entity5 at the set - piece for the final 10 minutes , but @entity4 ’s men managed to outfox the @entity20 to maintain their 100 percent start to the campaign .			1

@entity278 star scores two tries off the bench to secure win
@entity99 scores other try for @entity56
visitors continue *unbeaten* start to the season
