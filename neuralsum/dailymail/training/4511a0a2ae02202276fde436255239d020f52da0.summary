tax officials in @entity1 have admitted that they purposefully keep an eye on billionaires living in the state in order to ensure they do n’t miss out on revenue generated from income tax that would be lost if the rich residents moved elsewhere			1
tax officials in the state - home to some of the richest @entity12 - track the quarterly estimated payments of 100 high net - worth taxpayers and can tell when payments are down			1
of that number , about a half - dozen taxpayers have an effect on revenue that 's noticed in the legislature and @entity21			2
aerial photo of the @entity24 , @entity1 , estate belonging to billionaire hedge fund owner @entity25 : tax officials in @entity1 have admitted that they purposefully keep an eye on billionaires living in the state in order to ensure they do n’t miss out on revenue generated from income tax ' there are probably a handful of people , five to seven people , who if they just picked up and went , you would see that in the revenue stream , ' said @entity37 , the state 's commissioner of the @entity21			1
with one exception , he said , state officials do n't actually approach the super-rich			2
he said : ' there is n't friendly visiting or anything like that , how are you feeling ? doing all right ? doing ok ? ' two years ago , tax officials were alarmed that a super-rich hedge fund owner might leave and reduce the state 's income tax revenue			1
they set up a meeting and urged the unidentified taxpayer to stay			0
the effort was partly successful , with the taxpayer leaving @entity1 but agreeing to keep the hedge fund here			2
' it would be nice to have both , but at least we did n't lose both , ' said @entity37 , the state 's revenue commissioner			0
tax officials in a few states said they do not track individual tax payments , though state budget officials typically follow total quarterly tax payments by the rich to make sure revenue projections hold up			1
@entity69 , founder and co-chief investment officer of @entity71 , is one of @entity1 's richest residents			0
the state depends on the billions of dollars in revenue his income tax generates and some experts do n't believe there 's any need to worry about the super-rich moving to avoid high taxes			1
' the claims are almost always anecdotal , ' said @entity82 , executive director of the institute on @entity84			0
@entity1 tax officials wo n't say who the super-rich are , citing privacy , but it 's not hard to guess			1
many movers and shakers in and around @entity93 , the capital of the banking and hedge - fund world , work in or populate the verdant suburbs next door in @entity1			1
they include names like hedge fund owner @entity25 ; @entity99 , of @entity100 ; @entity69 , of @entity71 ; and @entity103 , of @entity104 , their net worth is more than $ 40 billion , according to @entity105			2
those four declined to discuss their experiences , if any , with @entity1 tax officials			1
but if they or other big - moneyed individuals or their businesses decide to leave , the danger is real			0
in april 2014 , super-rich taxpayers in @entity1 and elsewhere shielded their income through charitable donations or other means to avoid a tax hit following the expiration of federal tax cuts			1
the result : @entity1 income tax revenue plunged by nearly $ 281 million , more than 14 percent , compared with the same month a year before			1
in the 2014 budget year , state income tax revenue was $ 8.7 billion , more than half the $ 16.4 billion in total revenue from taxes and fees			1
the migration of the rich affects other taxes , such as the sales tax if wealthy car buyers purchase their @entity129 in a different state or country three of the half - dozen or so super-rich taxpayers in @entity1 use the services of the @entity24 accounting firm @entity135 while tax officials in several states say they track revenue from rich people 's taxes , none said they have approached super-wealthy taxpayers as @entity1 has , intending to persuade them to stay put			1
states may call on them if they see a marked increase or decrease in payments , said @entity148 , senior research associate at the @entity149			0
but he has never heard of state officials lobbying a taxpayer to stay put			0
@entity156 , home to @entity160 's @entity159 family , the owners of @entity154 and other super-wealthy taxpayers , does not contact them to alter their decisions , said @entity163 , the state 's assistant revenue commissioner			2
but the agency reviews what 's changing for the wealthiest employers and individuals as part of its revenue forecast			0
the super-rich tend to donate to charities when tax laws are in flux			0
@entity175 , chief development officer at the @entity176 , noted the phenomenon at the end of 2012 with the so - called fiscal cliff , the combination of expiring tax cuts and across - the - board government spending reductions			1
' it was a windfall for many charities , ' he said			0
three of the half - dozen or so super-rich taxpayers in @entity1 use the services of the @entity24 accounting firm @entity135 , and each has a yearly income of more than $ 1 billion			1
partner @entity189 also said he has seen a big step up in charitable giving			0
the migration of the rich affects other taxes , such as the sales tax if wealthy car buyers ' bought their @entity129 in @entity196 instead of @entity24 , ' he said			0
sen. l. @entity197 , the ranking @entity198 on the legislature 's @entity199 , said the disproportionate impact on state revenue by one group of taxpayers — in this case , the super-rich — is ' pretty frightening when you think of it			2
' even @entity1 's revenue commissioner acknowledges the state ca n't put too many eggs in its rich residents ' baskets			2
the more the government relies on the super-wealthy , the more volatile that revenue is , said @entity37 , a former @entity217 lawmaker			0
and raising taxes on the wealthy to attack income inequality has its limits , he said			0
tax policy , he said , should not make the state dependent on the very rich			0
' you do n't want a system that does n't ask them to do their fair share , ' he said , ' but you do n't want a system that makes you so reliant on their fair share that if they all picked up and left tomorrow or died tomorrow you 'd be screwed , as they say in the tax business			0
