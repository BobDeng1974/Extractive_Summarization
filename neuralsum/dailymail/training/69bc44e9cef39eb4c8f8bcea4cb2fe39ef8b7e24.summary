by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:37 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 08:08 est , 2 may 2013 ex-mps are demanding public money for them to tour the country at taxpayers ’ expense despite being given the boot by voters years ago , @entity1 can reveal			1
commons speaker @entity9 has been approached about creating a fund worth thousands of pounds for failed and retired politicians			2
and the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) also wants a return to the famous green benches to hold a debate in the @entity17 chamber once a year			1
the former mps want to hold a debate in the @entity17 chamber once a year to relive old glories the call comes from the same group which last year announced it wanted to award ex-mps with a gold - plated gong , which has now gone on sale for £ 199			1
representatives of the group of around 500 former mps have approached the @entity29 , which mr @entity9 chairs , about securing public funds to pay for their work			1
they have been told to submit an application in the next bidding round this autumn			2
they want to base the group on the @entity37 @entity36 , which receives a large chunk of its funding from a body founded with $ 7million of public money			1
but the extraordinary demand for former politicians to have state backing after leaving office has been condemned at a time when the government is imposing deep spending cuts on public services			1
@entity50 , @entity51 mp for nine years in the 1960s and 70s , said the money was needed to allow ex-politicians to travel the country and give talks at colleges and universities			2
but he admitted it could be ‘ seen to be trivial given all the pressures that people have ’ at a time of austerity			2
ex-mps can now buy a gold - plated medal for £ 199 from the @entity12 , which comes ' in a beautifully crafted box bound in soft @entity69 green leather with a cushion / silk inlay ' the @entity12 has 500 members , including @entity72 , sir @entity73 and @entity74			1
it was set up to help mps ejected from the @entity17 at elections to cope with ' becoming suddenly unemployed ' and the ' real blow ' of losing touch with friends in @entity80			1
it runs an ' outreach programme ' where former ministers and backbenchers give talks to students and voluntary groups			2
but mr @entity50 says public money is needed to pay for it			1
‘ i do n’t think we are talking about big money			2
one step would be to have specific levels to cover the outreach programme to go into areas and pick up expenses , ’ mr @entity50 told @entity1			0
‘ the second step having fully justified out worth and value would be to have a conference or seminar , something along the lines the @entity37 do			0
that could be low key and low budget			0
‘ my target and ambition is what they have done in the @entity107 and @entity108			0
’ former @entity51 mp @entity50 said time should be found for ex-politicians to debate in the @entity17 , but @entity113 mp @entity112 ( right ) said the famous green benches should not be used by ' all and sundry ' he suggested that ‘ towards the end of a session ’ in parliament when the government is ‘ looking for items to debate ’ an hour - long session should be set aside for former mps to hold a debate in the @entity17 chamber on ‘ the issues that they see ’			1
‘ it could be an enormous lift to the whole idea that when a member is no longer in the @entity29 he can still play an important role			0
’ ex-mps won a battle with commons authorities over the design of a gold - plated medal they wanted to award themselves			1
licenced by the @entity140 , the crowned portcullis emblem was blocked from being used on the @entity141 ’ gong			0
a @entity17 spokesman said the crowned portcullis was a royal badge and its use was had to be formally authorised and licensed by the @entity140			1
he added : ‘ it must not be used where there is a risk that its use may be wrongly represented as having the authority of the @entity29			0
' but the latest edition of the association ’s quarterly magazine reveals they @entity156 won the battle			2
the ‘ gold plated lapel badge ’ is on sale for £ 199			1
the advert states : ‘ a stylish gold plated hand polished badge / brooch depicting the wording former member of @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168			1
‘ personalised with your initials and individually numbered on reverse , it is a ﬁtting way to display your involvement in @entity174			0
‘ your badge / brooch will be placed in a beautifully crafted box bound in soft @entity69 green leather with a cushion / silk inlay , a brass plaque engraved with your name plus years of service will be attached to the box			0
’ but the ideas were rejected as an attempt to use public money for a ' reunion tour ' for failed politicians			1
@entity113 mp @entity112 said : ‘ i will be a former mp at some point			0
if people then want me to speak at a university i can either say yes or no. ‘ i would like to think i would say yes but i do n’t think the public should pay for that			1
’ he said he feared after the @entity166 was allowed to hold debates in the @entity197 that other groups would also demand access			0
‘ it would appear that my fears are being realised			0
i think the chamber should be for mps			0
' those people had an opportunity to have their say			0
' they have now moved on and i think debates in the chamber should be for mps and not all and sundry			0
’ @entity210 , campaign manager of the @entity211 said : ‘ only a small number of mps could think that taxpayers should pay for them to play ex-politicians , even after they have been booted out of office			2
‘ we already have the @entity217 without devoting time and money to bring back formers members of the @entity29 for one last hurrah			2
‘ it ’s @entity203 jobs to reach out to communities when they ’re in office , just because some miss it after they ’re done does not mean taxpayers should foot the bill for a reunion tour			0
’ the @entity12 wants to copy the @entity231 members of @entity107 which maintains a major sponsor through @entity233 , which was founded in 1988 by @entity107 with $ 7.5 million held in a trust fund in @entity37 treasury securities			0
mr @entity50 admitted it would be ‘ hard ’ for an ex-mp to publicly call for public money			1
he suggested it would ‘ take a strong , existing member who is not necessarily troubled by the ballot box to say this is what ought to happen ’			0
‘ the important thing is to recognise that individuals have got experience , have got some views , has been disciplined and what a terrible waste , ’ he added			0
mr @entity50 , who was @entity51 mp for @entity249 from 1966 - 1970 and @entity250 from 1974 - 1979 , said ex-mps were ‘ like footballers ’ who retire without earning a lot of money .			1
