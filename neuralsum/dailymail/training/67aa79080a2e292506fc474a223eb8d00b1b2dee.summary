by @entity1 reporter published : 11:04 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 11:04 est , 24 october 2013 when @entity4 's husband @entity3 died in 1989 aged 48 , the family was at a loss over what had claimed him so suddenly			1
only years later did they learn he was killed by a rare and deadly genetic disease called @entity9 - and that it was only just beginning to devastate the family			1
in 2006 , @entity4 's son @entity11 died aged 40 and in 2010 , it claimed another son , 42 - year - old @entity13			1
still the disease continued to ravage her family - claiming the life of her son @entity17 , 49 , this spring			2
and then on saturday her grandson - @entity19 's son - @entity18 passed away , aged just 25			1
a third son @entity17 , 49 , died in @entity27 the family , who live in @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , @entity32 , have just learned that @entity4 's six - year - old grandson also has the condition			1
speaking with @entity35 from her @entity32 home , @entity4 said it is like ' a nightmare and you ca n't wake up from it			2
' all of the men suffered from the most severe form of the disorder , vascular @entity9 , which can cause the walls of the blood vessels or intestines to rupture			1
the condition - for which there is no cure - can also weaken the heart 's largest artery , the aorta , as well as the arteries to the kidneys and spleen			1
missed : most recently , her 25 - year - old grandson @entity55 , pictured , died from the disease on saturday sudden : when her husband @entity3 , pictured , died in the 80s the family were not aware of the disease sufferers of @entity9 have faulty collagen - which usually acts as a glue in the body - in their connective tissues			1
it means that @entity9 weakens the bonds that hold organs , vessels and arteries together			1
there are six different kinds of @entity74 five of @entity4 's family members who died had the @entity77 , which is the most serious form			2
it can lead to the sudden rupturing of arteries or organs as the result of even minor trauma			0
there is no cure for the condition			2
according to the @entity87 , the vascular form of @entity9 affects about one in every 250,000 people			2
it is thought many more die from the disease but many victims do n't know they had it			0
it is genetic and if you have it , there is a 50 per cent chance your children do too			0
the disease affects connective tissues such as the skin , joints and blood vessel walls and its cause is genetic ; if you have it , there is a 50 per cent chance your children will have it too			1
' there is no treatment , ' @entity4 told @entity35			2
' there is no therapy			0
right now , there is nothing if you have it you have it			0
' for us , it 's like , what 's the end ? it just keeps happening and happening until there is no one left for it to happen to			1
' despite the family 's struggles , she said she is proud of the men in her family and the legacy they have all left behind			0
' there is no way that i could have been prouder of them , ' she said			0
' even though they were not here as long as we would have like them , they 've left us with so much in memory and faith and the things they have accomplished			0
' the family is still struggling with @entity145 's death at @entity146 in @entity29 on saturday			0
ripped apart : @entity55 , right , and his father @entity147 , left , died within months of each other this year fears : @entity4 , pictured with @entity147 , said she does not know how long they will continue to lose loved ones they remembered him as a promising photographer who achieved a civil engineering degree from the @entity156 before working towards a structural engineering master 's degree at the @entity158			1
his devastated grandmother is trying to stay strong during this tough time			0
' if you do n't have hope , then there is nothing , ' she said			0
see below for video var p = new anv_pl_def ( ) ; p.config = { } ; p.config.width = 636 ; p.config.height = 360 ; @entity167 ( " @entity168 @entity169 @entity170 " ) ;			0

@entity4 lost her husband , 48 , three sons , aged 40 , 42 and 49 , and grandson , 25 , to @entity9
another of her *grandchildren* , aged 6 , also suffers from the condition
@entity9 weakens connective tissues meaning that arteries can rupture
there is no cure and @entity4 said it ' keeps happening and happening until there is no one left for it to happen to '
