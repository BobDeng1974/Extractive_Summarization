since then there have been theories that mr @entity37 , 45 , was the main target , and that one or more local marksmen could have been responsible			2
intriguingly , the man found dead was from the village of @entity48 , where mr @entity37 lived with his heiress girlfriend			0
mr @entity22 confirmed that the man was ‘ questioned for two hours in april 2013 ’ , mainly because he was ‘ linked to mr @entity37 ’s family ’			1
firearms were found in his home in @entity48 , according to the local @entity54 newspaper , which broke news of the killing today			0
the paper said the ‘ violent death ’ would ‘ intrigue investigators ’ , and would lead to ‘ further investigations to make sure nothing was overlooked ’			0
investigation : police outside the @entity12 home in @entity13 in june 2013 , almost a year after the killings happened comments : @entity22 , the prosecutor in @entity23 , eastern @entity2 , said the parachutist left a ' six or seven page note ' saying he was ' disturbed ' by the questioning because it ' made him feel like a suspect ' @entity72 , a 48 - year - old old former policeman , was arrested over the killings in february and spent four days in custody			1

@entity83 , a @entity13 financial controller who is related to three of the victims , was the first suspect arrested in 2013			1
but the 54 - year - old has been told by @entity13 police that there is not enough evidence to charge him with the killing of his brother @entity92 , 50			1
the younger @entity12 was shot dead alongside his wife @entity94 , 47 , his mother - in - law @entity95 , 74 , and mr @entity37			2
the @entity12 couple 's daughters , @entity98 , seven , and @entity99 , four , survived the attack and are currently in the care of surviving family			1
while every detail of the @entity12 ’s lives has been made public by the @entity2 , very little has been said about mr @entity37 , the dead cyclist			1
but the @entity2 was involved in frictions of his own over a multi-million pounds chain of pharmacies which was being transferred to his girlfriend , @entity109 , 30			0
detectives have also uncovered romantic entanglements which @entity37 was trying to keep secret – another fact which might suggest a local motive and killer			2
@entity83 has a cast iron alibi - he was in @entity117 , @entity118 , on the day of the murder			0
he is convinced @entity37 was the real target , saying last october : ‘ they are covering up for someone in @entity2 in that region and they know it			0
