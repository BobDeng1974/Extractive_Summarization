by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was incredible for @entity3 in a 4 - 0 demolition of @entity5			1
the @entity7 superstar was at his brilliant best , scoring a sublime free - kick to open the scoring , before showing off a plethora of flicks and tricks that looked as if he was playing against children			2
but how did @entity18 's @entity17 based players get on ? brilliant : @entity2 was the star of the show as @entity3 beat @entity5 4 - 0 in a @entity21 warm - up good start : @entity18 's team have just one game before they start their campaign on home soil still a contracted to @entity27 - though not for long it would seem - @entity3 's no 1 was a commanding presence throughout			1
@entity5 rarely troubled @entity30 but he did pull off one spectacular save			2
after slipping on a terrible pitch at the @entity32 , @entity30 recovered and made an acrobatic leap to tip a looping header over the bar			0
he always looked assured and was given the captain 's armband after @entity38 went off			0
safe hands : @entity27 's @entity30 was in good form all night , pulling off one very good save after slipping quiet : @entity41 was overshadowed by @entity2 and @entity3 were better when @entity42 was introduced looked a little bit lost positionally and was completely overshadowed by the brilliant @entity2			1
he wants to play behind the striker but he often ended up out on the left , with @entity18 preferring to use the @entity7 man in the hole			2
his position for the @entity21 opener looks under threat as he does n't have the pace to operate out wide			2
was replaced by @entity42 early in the second half			0
struggled , as did his team - mates , in the opening 15 minutes as @entity5 started the better of the two			1
overrun in the midfield at times in what can sometimes look like a 4 - 2 - 4 for the hosts , but eventually found his footing as well as providing the usual energy			1
withdrawn at half - time and @entity3 were much more confident on the ball with his replacement , @entity64 , but by then @entity5 had given up			1
slow starter : @entity66 started slowly but eventually showed his usual vim and vigour in the midfield came on and provided some much needed width , allowing @entity2 more space in the middle			0
was in the right place at the right time to score the fourth goal , and would have had two assists had two inch - perfect crosses been aimed at somebody other than @entity79			0
could be in line to start for @entity18 , @entity3 looked much more balanced with @entity42 if the manager intends to play @entity2 as a second striker			1
late claim ? @entity42 's performance , including a goal , will give him a chance to start the opening game unused substitute			2
@entity90 fans will be extremely familiar with the way in which the @entity3 captain for the night picked up his yellow card			0
rushing out from the centre of defence to challenge his man on the half - way line , the rash @entity38 lashed out after being easily turned			0
actually settled down after that but @entity5 offered little threat			0
played a wondreful pass to @entity2 in the build - up to @entity104 's goal			1
reckless ; @entity38 was booked for the kind of tackle @entity90 fans will be glad to see the back of			0

@entity3 beat @entity5 4 - 0 in their first @entity21 warm - up match
@entity2 stole the show with a brilliant individual performance
