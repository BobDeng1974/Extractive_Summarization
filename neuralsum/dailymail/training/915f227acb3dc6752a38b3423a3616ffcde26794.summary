by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 1 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:55 est , 1 february 2014 difficult decision : staff at @entity5 yesterday put @entity6 down , their 83 - year - old flamingo it survived @entity10 and being set upon by a gang of youths but yesterday the world 's oldest known flamingo died in @entity15 at the age of at least 83			1
' @entity6 ' was put down by staff at @entity5 because its quality of life had deteriorated and it was ' complications associated with old age ' and arthritis , the zoo said on its blog			1
they admitted the decision had been ' difficult '			0
' @entity6 is best known for being the world 's oldest flamingo and the last @entity30 to have resided in @entity15 , ' they added			1
@entity6 was brought to the zoo in 1933 , although records are unclear about whether it came from @entity34 or @entity35			2
it arrived as a mature adult but its gender and exact year of birth are unknown			1
the bird , who was named after its species , had been a star attraction as it would confidently approach visitors			1
greater flamingos , characterised by pale plumage and pink bills , have a life expectancy of between 40 and 60 years in captivity , but less in the wild			0
the zoo â€™s chief executive @entity51 told the @entity54 newspaper staff had taken the decision after their octagenarian bird , who was already almost blind , took a turn for the worse this week			1
she said there was no more treatment that would have improved @entity6 's life			0
the zoo 's veterinary team had already put @entity6 on a course of anti-inflammatory pain medication to ensure its comfort after its health started to deteriorate last year			0
' @entity6 responded well to treatment and remarkably survived the cold winter , ' ms @entity51 said			0
prime : @entity6 had been a favourite at the zoo over the decades			0
it arrived in 1933 as an adult from either @entity74 or @entity75 @entity76 old bird : @entity6 stunned staff with its recovery from a vicious 2008 attack that left it with a fractured skull seniority : @entity83 was the zoo 's oldest resident perfect match : @entity6 and @entity87 were described as ' a pair of grumpy old men '			1
@entity87 is now the last flamingo in @entity15 winging it : @entity6 , with his striking red wing feathers , had a companion in @entity87			1
staff will check up on @entity87 to see how it is affected by its friend 's death the elderly bird , whose sex is unknown , had already beaten the odds to make a remarkable recovery after a vicious attack in 2008 that left it with a fractured skull			0
four youths aged 17 to 19 were charged with the attack			0
the zoo said it may erect a memorial to @entity6 near the heritage - listed @entity110 , the zoo 's oldest exhibit , which was built in 1885			0
those were the days : when @entity6 arrived the zoo was home to several flamingos but because of an import ban @entity6 had just one companion in his twilight years , chilly the @entity120 flamingo , now the last flamingo in @entity15 the flamingo is survived by companion chilly the @entity120 flamingo , 65 , which is said to be the last flamingo in @entity15			1
zoo staff said they would keep a close eye on @entity87 to see how @entity6 's death affects it			2
the former head of @entity15 's zoos , @entity129 , said at the time of the attack that @entity6 and @entity87 were ' like two grumpy old men but they will certainly miss each other if they are apart for any length of time '			2
@entity87 is the only remaining flamingo in the country			0
although @entity5 used to be home to several , but the zoo has not been able to replace those which have died because there is now a moratorium on the importation of flamingos , which can carry a raft of avian diseases , into @entity15 .			2

the bird named @entity6 was a star attraction at @entity5
it had arrived in 1933 as a mature adult but records are *n't* clear where from
heart - broken staff to the decision to put it down this week
arthritic and blind , @entity6 had taken a turn for the worse
since its death , only one flamingo remains in @entity15
