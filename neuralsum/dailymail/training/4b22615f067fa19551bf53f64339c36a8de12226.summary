the @entity1 hospital that sent home @entity3 the first time he showed up at the emergency room has a machine that could have detected @entity7 in less than an hour - but doctors were barred from using it because of federal regulations			1
@entity11 has treated three @entity7 patients - @entity3 , who died last week , and two of its own nurses who contracted the disease from @entity3			2
in each case , the hospital had to wait up to two days for confirmation that that patients were infected with the virus			0
the @entity20 has also reported the medical records reveal nurses did n't wear full protective gear while treating @entity3 for two days while they awaited the results of his @entity7 test			0
@entity43 military doctors sent to @entity44 to combat the disease are already using the @entity27 , which has more than 90percent accuracy , according to @entity47			1
the device costs $ 39,000 - a pittance by the standards of medical devices in hospitals - and was developed by @entity54 - based @entity53 to test the genetic markers of a slew of gastrointestinal and respiratory viruses			1
it can use blood or saliva samples and it 's proven adept at quickly detecting @entity7 , as well			0
@entity11 acquired one two years ago , though it has been prohibited from using the device to diagnose patients because the @entity36 had approved it only for research use - and not for testing @entity7			2
@entity3 was sent home from the hospital the first time he showed up with symptoms of @entity7			0
the @entity27 could have detected the disease in minutes the @entity27 boasts easy , fast testing - but the @entity36 is not convinced it 's effective enough to be used for diagnosis in hospitals this , despite the fact that @entity53 has received a $ 240million grant from the @entity73 's @entity74 to hone the device to detect @entity7 and other deadly pathogens			1
the @entity36 has now approved the device for @entity7 screening for research and has allowed hospitals to buy the necessary modifications to allowed their @entity27 systems to detect the virus			1
defense one also points out that the device could even be deployed at airports to screen travelers from @entity44			2
with results in less than an hour , the @entity27 could provide accurate tests to keep patients sick with @entity7 out of the @entity43			1
currently , some airports are using temperature screening to check if travelers have a fever			0
health experts have warned that taking a simple fever reducer could allow infected travelers to slip through security .			0

the @entity27 can screen for @entity7 with 90percent accuracy
it is being using by @entity43 military doctors in @entity44
@entity105 had one of the $ 39,000 devices but could not use it to diagnose diseases
the military has given the @entity54 - based developer of the machine a $ 240million grant to perfect deadly virus detection
