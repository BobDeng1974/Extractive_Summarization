baroness @entity0 said that the rate of global warming might have decreased , and that this could support the effectiveness of green policies government environmental measures may already have helped to slow down global warming , an energy minister has claimed			1
baroness @entity0 said the rate of warming might have decreased , which could support the effectiveness of green policies			1
her comments came as @entity14 , a @entity16 peer and critic of government efforts to stop temperature rises , questioned her on when warming would start again			2
he told peers at question time in the @entity23 : ' the fifth assessment report of the @entity25 has confirmed in the same words that there has been a hiatus in global warming for at least the last 15 years			1
' and he asked @entity30 : ' would you give us the opinion of your scientific advisers as to when this hiatus is likely to end ? ' @entity30 told him : ' you raise a couple of issues that we would dispute in a longer debate , but what we do recognise is that there a change in weather patterns happening across the globe , that climate change is occurring			0
' it may have slowed down , but that is a good thing			0
it could well be that some of the measures we are taking today is helping that to occur			2
' for @entity53 , baroness @entity52 said the fifth report would be published on friday			1
in april , the @entity25 said it is ' 95 per cent ' certain that climate change is man made , but still could not explain why the world has barely got any hotter in the last 15 years			1
the @entity25 report said that sea levels have risen by seven inches ( 19cm ) since 1901 and are expected to rise a further 10 to 32 inches ( 26 to 82cm ) by the end of the century			1
it added that concentrations of @entity63 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased to levels that are unprecedented in at least 800,000 years			0
but the landmark report conceded that world temperatures have barely risen in the past 15 years , despite growing amounts of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere			1
in april , the @entity25 said it is ' 95 per cent ' certain that climate change is man made , but still could not explain why the world has barely got any hotter in the last 15 years			1
during today 's @entity23 session , baroness @entity52 said the fifth assessment report on this research would be published on friday independent research similarly found that there has been little increase in the average temperature of the @entity83 ’s surface since the turn of the century			1
previous studies claimed this hiatus has lasted for 15 years , but professor @entity87 from @entity88 believes temperatures have remained constant since 1995 ' [ the fifth report ] is likely to say yet again that there is incontrovertible proof now that climate change is a serious issue and we all must take notice of that , ' @entity52 added			1
she asked @entity30 : ' would you accept that friday might be a good opportunity to point that out to some of the backbenchers in your party			2
' @entity30 replied : ' it is n't just about backbenchers on my side			0
i think it is about making sure we deliver an informed debate and perhaps , thus far , that debate has n't really taken place			0
' independent research recently discovered that , since the turn of the century , there has been little increase in the average temperature of the @entity83 ’s surface			0
what is the @entity25 ? a scientific body with 195 member countries			1
the panel was established by the @entity123 in 1988 to assess the causes and impacts of climate change			0
since then , it has released four assessments , each stating the human link to global warming with more certainty than the previous one			1
the @entity25 does n't conduct its own research , but appoints hundreds of experts to review and summarise the latest scientific studies on climate change			2
it is headed by @entity138 , a scientist from @entity139			0
what is the report for ? the report forms the scientific basis for @entity123 negotiations aimed at curbing global warming			1
it will be a reference point for governments as they negotiate a new global climate agreement , which is supposed to be adopted by 2015 and to take effect in 2020			2
why has the @entity151 ? it has been argued that the @entity25 process is so time - consuming and laborious that by the time the assessments are published they are already out of date			1
a series of errors embarrassed the authors of the 2007 assessment , including the incorrect statement that the glaciers in the @entity162 would disappear by 2035			0
there has also been criticism about the @entity25 's lack of openness			2
previous studies claimed this hiatus has lasted for 15 years , but new research believes the temperature has remained almost constant since 1995			0
the conclusions were made by an economics professor @entity87 from the @entity88 in @entity173 who studied average land and ocean temperatures from the @entity177 temperature series , dating back to 1850			2
@entity177 is a monthly record of temperature readings created by the @entity180 of the @entity181 , and the @entity183 ’s @entity182			0
it combines sea surface temperatures with land surface air temperatures into a grid that shows variations and anomalies			0
professor @entity87 also compared these readings to those taken by the @entity192 ( @entity194 ) satellite , which has measured upper air temperatures since 1979			0
in both datasets , he noticed a period where the line levelled off , from around 1990 .			0

baroness @entity0 made the claims during a session in @entity23
she said warming may have decreased , which could support the effectiveness of green policies
assessment of @entity25 report will be published friday
it is expected to address how measures are impacting global temperatures
