by @entity0 published : 16:38 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 01:42 est , 10 october 2013 prime minister @entity1 supports the comments made by the director - general of @entity4 , who criticised @entity6 's expose on spycraft @entity1 yesterday joined the attacks on the @entity6 for publishing secret files that have put national security at risk			1
the prime minister threw his full weight behind @entity4 director - general @entity13 who has warned the leaks are a ‘ gift ’ to terrorists			1
mps and security experts weighed in too , claiming the newspaper had exposed the @entity21 ’s intelligence secrets to @entity23 fanatics and foreign spies			1
they said @entity6 editor @entity25 had been naive to think it was harmless to publish the documents stolen by fugitive @entity29 agent @entity28			2
security sources pointed to remarks from the @entity21 ’s deputy national security adviser suggesting damage has already been done to @entity21			1
@entity34 , who reports directly to mr @entity1 , warned that revealing the techniques @entity36 uses to spy on terrorists may cause ‘ widespread loss of life ’			0
a no 10 spokesman – when asked whether mr @entity1 agreed with mr @entity13 ’s comments – said : ‘ the prime minister thinks it was an excellent speech and we are , as you would expect , always keeping under review the measures that are needed to contribute to keeping our country safe			1
i would happily point you to all parts of the director general ’s speech			0
’ in another development , there were last night accusations of editorial bias at the @entity56 , which initially ignored the scathing criticisms of the @entity6			2
the corporation later offered mr @entity25 an interview on @entity60 ’s @entity61 to defend his paper			0
he denied putting lives at risk and – defying security officials – said he would continue publishing top secret information , which the paper has been splashing across its front pages since june			1
mr @entity25 , who critics claimed was given an easy interview , said : ‘ we are working slowly and responsibly but as we discover further stories that we think merit the debate , the debate that everyone says is necessary , then we will go on publishing			0
’ fury : the spy chief : @entity4 director - general @entity13 has blasted the @entity6 's publication of @entity21 's espionage capabilities security officials and mps dismissed the suggestion that the newspaper was capable of knowing what would and would not assist @entity21 ’s enemies			1
they pointed to a devastating legal submission drawn up by mr @entity34 in august			0
he said : ‘ it is impossible for a journalist alone to form a proper judgment about what disclosure of protectively marked intelligence does or does not damage national security			0
‘ the fragmentary nature of intelligence means that even a seemingly innocuous piece of information can provide important clues to individuals involved in extremism or terrorism			0
‘ there is therefore a real risk that that publication or disclosure could cause unintended damage to that national security			2
@entity6 newspaper editor @entity25 was described as ' naive ' ‘ it is worth reiterating the point that real damage has in fact already been done to @entity21 national security by the media revelations ( both in the @entity21 and internationally )			1
’ he said the leaking of the kind of top secret information held by the @entity6 was likely to ‘ lead directly to widespread loss of life ’ and ‘ to cause exceptionally grave damage to the effectiveness of security of the @entity21 ’			1
sir @entity120 , chairman of @entity122 ’s intelligence and security committee , also backed mr @entity13 ’s speech , which contained a warning that several thousand fanatics living in @entity21 see the public as a legitimate target			1
the former foreign secretary dismissed the idea that @entity28 or journalists at the @entity6 could judge which information it was safe to publish			2
‘ when we know that @entity28 has over 50,000 classified documents relevant to @entity21 interests the idea that he or others would be able identify which are damaging to national security is naive , ’ he said			1
‘ even knowing the technology that is available to @entity36 or @entity4 or @entity140 is valuable			2
some of these terrorists are very , very smart			0
it ’s not like the old days when communication could only be by letter or telephone call			0
‘ unless they [ the security services ] are at the cutting edge of modern technology they will be behind the terrorists who are smart on encryption and trying to conceal what they are doing			0
’ @entity154 , of the respected @entity155 , claimed the @entity6 had been ‘ wrong ’ to ‘ deliberately expose ’ the @entity21 ’s intelligence secrets			1
he said : ‘ the leaks we have seen from @entity28 in the @entity6 will provide information to terrorists , but also aggressive foreign intelligence agencies operating in the @entity21			1
’ the independent mp @entity162 , a former @entity163 security adviser , said intelligence data should not be published if it compromised public security			2
thousands of classified documents about the @entity169 and @entity36 were published by @entity6 former @entity169 employee @entity28			2
some of the information was so sensitive that @entity21 agents had to be moved for their own safety in august , police detained @entity175 , the partner of @entity6 journalist @entity176 , for nine hours at @entity177			1
mr @entity175 had been carrying intelligence files leaked by @entity28 ‘ if in any way our security is compromised by revealing too much , that ’s a mistake , ’ he added			0
‘ just imagine if we had revealed the whole enigma secret during the @entity184 might have been in the public ’s interest – but we ’d have lost the war			0
’ mr @entity34 ’ remarks were made in a submission to judges in the case of @entity175 , the partner of @entity6 journalist @entity176 , who was stopped at @entity177 in possession of at least 58,000 classified stolen documents			2
he had been ferrying them from a @entity28 associate in @entity196 to @entity197 , where he shares a home with @entity176 , the author of many of the controversial articles			0
mr @entity34 said the material was ‘ highly likely to describe techniques crucial in life - saving counter-terrorist operations , and other activities vital to @entity21 national security ’			1
@entity28 is currently holed up in @entity206 , with temporary political asylum			0
the spy chief said there is a ' growing proportion of groups and individuals taking it upon themselves to commit acts of terrorism '			1
pictured is the 7/7 @entity217 bombings , which killed 52 civilians @entity219 in @entity217			0
the leak was described as the greatest damage to @entity223 security apparatus in history			0
