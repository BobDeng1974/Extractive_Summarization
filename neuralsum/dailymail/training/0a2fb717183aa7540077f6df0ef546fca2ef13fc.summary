@entity0 last night provided a boost after the turmoil between boss @entity3 and owner @entity4 by breaking their transfer record and signing two players for a combined £ 6.5million			1
striker @entity8 joined from @entity9 for a fee of £ 5m to top the 1997 capture of @entity12 , while @entity14 winger @entity13 arrived for £ 1.5m			1
but another note of concern emerged with key player @entity17 set to leave for @entity18 with the clubs negotiating a fee of around £ 3.5m			0
incoming : @entity8 will step up to the @entity21 after joining @entity0 for £ 5.5million @entity17 ’s exit is believed to be another deal that initially progressed without @entity3 ’s full knowledge			2
the manager was angered by sales of @entity27 and @entity28 to @entity29 behind his back , before @entity17 told the 52 - year - old last week about his desire for @entity33 football			0
@entity4 had challenged @entity34 , 23 , to sign the new contract first offered in february but it is understood the terms are significantly less than certain team - mates and he will not be putting pen to paper			0
@entity18 boss @entity40 is keen on the midfielder , who has scored 12 goals in 53 starts since moving to the @entity44 from @entity45 for £ 1m in 2012 , and would offer regular game time			0
double swoop : @entity0 have also captured @entity13 for £ 1.5million from @entity14			1

@entity8 joins @entity0 for £ 5million
