by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 10 november 2012 @entity2 : 23:06 est , 12 november 2012 i have a blinding headache and i feel dizzy			1
i ’m in my study , barely able to concentrate			2
my brain seems to have turned to cotton wool and i am behaving like an ill - tempered despot			0
‘ @entity10 , mummy , mummy , ’ starts my four - year - old			1
sometimes i find her drip - torture attempts at attracting my attention amusing			0
‘ get out ! ’ i blurt , and instantly feel guilty			0
this is not – as you may have assumed – a hangover			0
nor am i ill. rather , i am suffering from the effects of sugar withdrawal , and it is excruciating			1
so why have i quit sugar ? we know too much rots the teeth and makes us fat			1
but cutting it out of my diet completely – what is the point of that ? taking stock : writer @entity0 sits atop her annual consumption of sugar before quitting - a scary six stone a growing number of @entity36 scientists believe the sweet stuff contributes to 35 million deaths worldwide each year			1
they say added sugar ( rather than natural sugars found in fruit , for instance ) is in part responsible for obesity , type - 2 diabetes , heart disease , certain cancers and liver problems			1
and it seems the message has hit home			0
in the @entity54 , there is a whole genre of literature devoted to sugar and its evils			1
endocrinologist @entity59 ’s @entity60 : the @entity62 lecture has been viewed almost three million times on @entity64			1
sugar is addictive , says @entity59			1
he claims sugar causes insulin levels to go up , which interferes with the appetite - supressing hormone leptin			1
his devotees say the only route to good health is to cut out added sugar completely in what has been dubbed ‘ the @entity74 ’			1
advocated on countless blogs – and by a couple of my friends – those who follow it say they have bags more energy , have lost weight ( if they were fat ) and have better skin			0
so i decided to give it a go			0
i expected it to be dull , but i was n’t prepared for how horrific i felt to begin with			0
yet despite that , the experience has made me vow to change the way i eat for ever			1
snack swap : switching from baked beans to fresh berries cuts your sugar consumption with six teaspoons when i tell a friend about my project , he laughs in a way that suggests he does n’t believe i can do it			1
‘ you are a sugarholic , ’ he says			0
is he right ? i calculate my average added sugar consumption and am horrified to discover that it is about 100g ( or 25 teaspoons ) a day			1
i drink about a bottle of prosecco per week , which contains 15g of sugar			1
despite not adding sugar to tea or drinking coke ( which has a staggering 35g or nine teaspoons of added sugar per can ) , i am hoovering down 40kg – about six stone – of added sugar a year			1
the @entity113 recommends we consume no more than 60g ( about 15 teaspoons ) daily , but surveys suggest the average @entity116 eats closer to 20 teaspoons			0
experts say most people vastly underestimate their sugar intake , not realising that it is added to bread , ready meals , pasta sauces and even bland breakfast cereals			1
@entity124 , spokeswoman for the @entity125 , says : ‘ when surveys are conducted , people do n’t necessarily remember all their snacks and drinks			0
cereal bars and diet yoghurts contain masses of sugar			1
six stone a year for a busy mother sounds quite feasible			1
’ so what is this sugar onslaught doing to our bodies ? ‘ sugar is a carbohydrate , ’ says dr @entity139 , a liver specialist at @entity142 ’s and @entity143 hospitals in @entity144			1
‘ complex carbohydrates – such as bread , pasta and potatoes – are like chains of sugar molecules			1
the gut breaks them down into single beads so they can be absorbed into to the liver			0
‘ processed sugar , which is single - molecular beads , is instantly absorbed			1
in the case of a high - sugar diet , glucose is delivered to the liver in a big lump			1
when the liver ’s reserves of glycogen – the storage molecule for glucose – are full , a biochemical process converts it into fat			0
obese patients have a fatty liver , like foie gras			0
’ spoonful of sugar : it is recommended to eat maximum 15 teaspoons of sugar a day , but the average @entity116 consumes nearly 20 yet being slim is no defence in itself			1
‘ people who diet without exercise are prone to excess internal fat , ’ says dr @entity139			0
‘ excess fat means our bodies become less sensitive to insulin , which helps store sugar in the cells			1
this can lead to type - 2 diabetes			0
’ statistics from the @entity193 show almost three million @entity194 have diabetes , while heart and circulatory diseases account for more than 191,000 deaths a year			1
my blood sugar is within the normal range , but i suffer from mood swings , bloating and energy slumps			1
and , as i approach my 40th birthday , my skin looks drained			0
could going sugar - free help ? ‘ we do n’t recommend completely cutting out sugar , ’ says consultant dietitian @entity208			1
‘ but if you are trying to avoid added sugar , look at labels – anything with glucose , fructose , sucrose , maltose , corn syrup , honey , molasses or treacle contains added sugar			1
’ breakfast : cheerios , 15g sugar ( 4 teaspoons * ) or 2 slices toast , 2.4g ( half tsp ) , marmalade , 8g ( 2 tsp ) , 200ml orange juice , 20g ( 5 tsp ) snack : @entity231 , 28.5g ( 7 tsp ) or @entity230 , 11g ( 3 tsp ) lunch : baked beans on toast , 20.8g + 2.4g ( 6 tsp ) or coronation chicken sandwich , 15g ( 4 tsp ) snack : 2 @entity237 , 6.8g ( 1.5 tsp ) or @entity239 yoghurt , 16g ( 4 tsp ) supper : lasagne ready meal + veg , 6.4g ( 1.5 tsp ) , @entity243 , 23g ( 6 tsp ) or sweet and sour chicken , rice , 21.8g ( 5.5 tsp ) , 250ml prosecco , 3.75g ( 1tsp ) total sugar : 102.9g / 98.0g ( 25 day tsp a day ) breakfast : rye bread , butter , marmite or eggs ( poached or scrambled ) , mushrooms , no toast snack : cheese oatcakes , almonds lunch : @entity258 , jacket potato with butter and cheese , spinach , peas or baked potato , cheese , salad snack : banana , apple supper : @entity269 , onion and cheese on rye bread or roast chicken breast ( home - made – watch out for shop - bought as can have sugary marinades ) , stir - fried veg , natural yogurt with blueberries and strawberries @entity280 added sugar : zero ! when i check the loaf of @entity285 sliced brown bread i use for breakfast toast , i see that it contains almost half a teaspoon ( 1.6g ) of added sugar per slice			2
all @entity290 has almost 13g – more than three teaspoons – in a 40g bowl , including milk			0
and marmalade is out of the question , being 60 per cent sugar			2
instead , i eat six cheese oatcakes , sugar content zero			1
baked beans – my staple – contains 10g of sugar per 200g tin			2
i stir - fry vegetables and eat them with brown rice			2
i have a headache and the urge to eat sugar is agonising			1
i munch on almonds , which balance blood sugar			2
to the disgust of my children , biscuits and chocolate are replaced with oatcakes and dried fruit			0
a study by @entity318 found women who ate a high - sugar diet had almost three times the risk of getting colorectal cancer			2
biologist dr @entity323 , of @entity324 , points out that rats fed large quantities of sugar display signs of @entity328 ’s			2
‘ high - sugar intake appears to damage brain metabolism , ’ he says			2
indeed , studies have shown that those with diabetes and even pre-diabetes are more prone to developing @entity328			0
sweet death : our overconsumption of sugar is a contributing factor in 35 million deaths a year , according to @entity36 scientists for me , the clincher is ageing			1
researchers at the @entity344 in the @entity345 found that people with high blood - sugar levels were judged to look older than those with lower levels			2
‘ over time , sugar affects the skin by means of a process called glycation , ’ says consultant dermatologist @entity350 at @entity351 the @entity352 in @entity144			2
‘ excess glucose binds protein molecules to collagen and elastin in the skin			0
@entity363 and elastin are important in keeping skin supple			0
’ on the school run , another mother pulls me aside			0
‘ you look great at the moment , ’ she whispers			0
‘ what have you had done ? ’ i assure her , nothing			0
dr @entity323 tells me sugar - induced metabolic damage can be reversed			2
‘ we conducted a study involving a low - carb diet coupled with high exercise , which suggested you could rectify the damage			0
‘ fat burning was more effective and the body reacted more efficiently to high levels of glucose			0
’ i have lost a couple of pounds , and feel strangely calm all the time			0
by now , i am convinced that a low or no - sugar diet is the way forward			2
when i joyfully pour baked beans on to granary bread , they taste artificial and cloying			0
it appears you can train your tastebuds away from sweetness			0
it is slightly different with the prosecco and i ’m certainly not checking the sugar content on every packet , but the cupboard is still full of oatcakes rather than biscuits			2
dr @entity402 , nutrition communications manager for @entity403 , which is funded by the sugar industry , said : ‘ @entity60 makes foods palatable			2
‘ it is important not to demonise any food			0
@entity60 can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet			0
’ she added that @entity59 ’s criticisms focused on high - fructose corn syrup , a sugar not commonly used in the @entity194 .			2

' @entity415 ' @entity0 would eat six stone of sugar every year
