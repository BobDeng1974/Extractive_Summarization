by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 17:16 est , 30 september 2012 updated : 05:23 est , 1 october 2012 the boys of @entity4 celebrated their astonishing @entity6 victory on sunday with lots of hugs and plenty of @entity10			2
after stunning the @entity12 by clawing back five points on the final day of play , the golf superstars hammed it up in front of the camera at the awards ceremony at @entity19 near @entity20 , @entity21			1
@entity22 , who arrived to his match - up with just ten minutes to spare , poked fun at his time zone mix - up by wearing a giant clock around his neck as he chugged a massive bottle of @entity10			2
@entity62 later locked in an @entity12 loss with a missed putt from inside four feet , to halve his match with @entity66			1
the @entity48 finished with 14 1/2 points while the @entity12 had 13 1/2			1
@entity62 and @entity58 , the anchors in the lineup , did n't win a single match at @entity71			1
' this one is for all of @entity4 , ' @entity4 coach @entity53 said			0
the @entity48 wore the image of @entity74 on their sleeves and played their hearts out sunday at @entity71 to match the greatest comeback in history and head home with that precious gold trophy			1
@entity4 got its payback for @entity82			0
@entity33 gave @entity34 golf redemption for @entity84			1
drink up : @entity36 's @entity85 ( center ) basks in the glory of his team 's win by drinking large servings of champagne celebration : @entity33 wrapped himself in a @entity95 flag and wildly celebrated his victory at @entity19 near @entity20 no , they could n't : this clever bit of skywriting -- president 's @entity101 's slogan for a tournament in his home town -- was not enough to propel the @entity12 to victory ' @entity74 will always be present with this team			1
he was a big factor for this event for the @entity48 side , and last night when we were having that meeting , i think the boys understood that believing was the most important thing			2
and i think they did			0
' @entity116 was the first to embrace @entity53 , which was only fitting			0
it was @entity116 who gave @entity4 hope saturday evening when he made five straight birdies to turn a loss into a win and swing momentum in @entity4 's favor			2
@entity116 was up to his fist - pumping , eye - bulging tricks again on the final day , winning the last two holes in his match against @entity131 champion @entity130			1
sealed : @entity34 @entity33 ensured @entity4 could not be beaten in the tournament when he sank a five - foot putt for par on sunday it 's good ! @entity33 carefully lined up his putt before the successful shot on the 18th hole on sunday and he had plenty of help			1
@entity4 's top five players in the lineup all won , including @entity22 , who was lucky to be playing			0
@entity22 kept thinking his match was at 12.25pm -- it was listed in eastern time , not @entity145 -- and he needed a police escort to get to the course with 10 minutes to spare			0
then , he came up with key birdies to hand @entity149 his first loss of the week			0
the biggest match might have belonged to @entity35			0
he was on the verge of losing to @entity153 when @entity85 holed a 12 - foot par putt to halve the 16th , made a 35 - foot birdie putt from the back of the 17th green to win the hole , and then closed out @entity153 with a 12 - foot birdie on the last hole			1
six of the 12 matches went to the 18th hole on sunday			0
the @entity12 won only one of them			2
the @entity12 also rallied from a four - point deficit to win in 1999 at @entity82			1
this was different , though			0
the @entity12 won big in those early matches			2
at @entity71 , so many of them could have gone either way			0
magic moment : @entity33 sinks the winning put on the 18th before running over to celebrate with his team - mates dropped : @entity62 missed a putt from inside four feet , losing his match to @entity175 @entity66 , resulting in @entity4 winning the tournament outright loss : this is the moment @entity62 missed his putt and sealed a win for the @entity48 it was so close , so tense , that either side could have won the @entity6 down to the very end			1
@entity58 made an 8 - foot par putt on the 18th , and @entity33 faced a par putt from 6 feet to win the match			1
if he missed , the @entity12 would get a half - point , and @entity62 was leading 1 - up over @entity66 and in the middle of the 18th fairway			1
@entity33 , a former no. 1 and major champion who has struggled all year , poured it in the middle and the celebration was on			2
late : @entity22 showed up in the nick of time no 1 : @entity22 overcame a strong challenge from @entity149 ' it 's a feeling i never had before , ' @entity33 said			1
' on friday , i sat down with @entity199 and talked a little bit about the @entity6 because my attitude was not the right one			0
but now i know how important the @entity6 is			0
' he could barely speak at this point , not so much from pure emotion but having to scream over the crowd behind him			0
players were hugging and crying , and the small @entity48 contingent that had been drowned out all week was serenading themselves with what has become the theme song of the @entity6			2
' @entity211 , ole , ole , ole , ' they sang merrily , even as the teams prepared for the closing ceremony			0
@entity4 now has won seven of the last nine @entity218 , and even more remarkable about this comeback is that they did it on the road .			0

@entity33 's six - foot putt ensured @entity48 would *retain* the trophy
@entity62 ' missed shot from inside four feet meant the @entity12 lost 14 1/2 to 13 1/2
