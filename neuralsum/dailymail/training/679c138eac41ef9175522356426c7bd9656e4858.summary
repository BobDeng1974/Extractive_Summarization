millions of women worldwide endure unwanted pregnancies each year because they are fearful of modern forms of contraception , a report has claimed			1
in fact , 40 per cent of women who avoid contraception do so because they worry about the side effects and health implications of methods such as the @entity11 , coils and condoms			1
and almost 20 per cent do n't use protection because they vastly underestimated the risk of pregnancy , the @entity15 study found			1
as a result of such attitudes , there are 15 million unwanted pregnancies worldwide each year			1
the findings apply to a third of the global population , with many who become unintentionally pregnant facing disease , and poorer work prospects			0
the researchers also warned that lack of proper contraception can result in unwanted abortions			2
they looked at contraceptive use among 12,874 women aged 15 to 49 who became pregnant unintentionally			0
they compared them with 111,301 sexually active women who were neither pregnant nor wanting to be from 35 countries			0
the researchers then calculated the number of undesired pregnancies and the proportion that were attributable to not using modern contraception , including the @entity11 , male and female condoms , the coil , sterilisation and injectable contraceptives			2

it was also revealed that traditional methods , including withdrawal , and trying to time sex outside the fertile period of a woman 's menstrual cycle , made it 2.7 times more likely a woman would end up with an unwanted pregnancy			2
and using no contraception at all made it 14.5 times more likely they would end up pregnant			0

and using no contraception at all made it 14.5 times more likely they would end up pregnant			0
it was also discovered that the poorest and least well educated women were the least likely to use modern contraception			0
of the 14,893 who did not use contraception and did not want to get pregnant , the main reason given for non-use was fear of side - effects and health concerns , with 5,559 women ( a surprising 37 per cent ) saying it put them off			1
another 17.6 per cent were found to underestimate the risk of pregnancy			1
and 2.4 per cent said contraception was too expensive , with the same number saying they did n't know where to get contraceptives			0
study author dr @entity98 , from the @entity15 's @entity97 , said : ' this study has many implications			2
' for instance , " health concerns " was the most common reason given for not using modern contraception , yet these concerns are not backed up by evidence			1
worries : 40 per cent of women who had avoided contraception did so because they feared the side effects and health implications of methods such as the @entity11 , coils and condoms ' health workers have an important role to play in reassuring , educating , treating symptoms and finding the methods that best suits an individual			1
' however , frontline health workers need the skills to do this , and our experience has been that many have the same misconceptions			0
' we could prevent the overwhelming majority of pregnancies if we could debunk the myths and misperceptions about modern methods and use long - term methods of contraception , such as implants and intrauterine devices			0
' he added : ' national strategies need to be put in place to address unfounded health concerns , fear of side - effects , opposition and underestimated risk of pregnancy			1
' these need to be coupled with good quality contraception that is available and affordable			0
' the findings were published in the journal @entity148 .			0

*15m* of 16.7 million unwanted pregnancies a year ' could easily be avoided '
' health concerns ' was the most common reason given for not using various forms of contraception , @entity15 study found
around 20 *%* of women vastly underestimated the risk of pregnancy
