by @entity0 new @entity2 pundit @entity1 has wasted no time tearing into @entity3 , the coach who controversially dropped him last month			1
appearing on the sports network on wednesday for their @entity6 , former star @entity1 lambasted defeatist coach @entity3 for repeating for the second time in as many weeks that the @entity8 has no chance at all of winning the trophy			1
' this will come as a surprise to nobody , but i do n't agree with @entity3 , ' said @entity1 who will work for @entity2 for the duration of the 32 - nation tournament which kicks - off on thursday in @entity18			1
scroll down for @entity19 straight talking : @entity1 has said that @entity3 is talking nonsense and the @entity21 has every chance of winning the @entity6 in @entity18 ' and as someone who has been in that locker room and has sat next to the players , we agree with the supporter group @entity28 : we believe that we will win			1
' i think that ’s the way @entity8 think and i think that ’s the sentiment			0
' @entity3 was blasted by @entity8 soccer fans when he claimed in a @entity34 article that his team were simply turning up at the @entity6 hoping for the best			2
' we can not win the @entity6 because we are not at that level yet , ' @entity3 said			2
' for us , we have to play the game of our lives seven times to win the tournament			0
' indeed , for effect , @entity3 repeated this claim on wednesday at his first news conference after arriving in @entity18			1
' if it ’s now @entity8 or not @entity8 , i do n’t know			0
you can correct me however you want , ' the @entity21 coach pundit : @entity1 pulled no punches in his first appearance on @entity2 as a soccer pundit for the @entity6 @entity3 won the @entity52 as a player for @entity54 and coached @entity54 to the 2006 semifinals			1
however , @entity1 was not just being a blind patriot in his attack on @entity3			1
he made a compelling case for the questionable psychology behind @entity3 's supposed realism			2
' if we 're really expecting to go out and beat @entity62 , beat @entity63 and beat @entity54 -- in my opinion @entity54 is one of the best teams in the world			0
if you can beat @entity54 , why ca n't you beat anybody else ? ' it does n't mean it 's going to happen , but i believe the @entity21 can win the @entity6 and i think all of @entity8 believes it			2
' @entity2 are no doubt excited by the prospect of more potential headline making contradictions from @entity1 , the all - time leading scorer for the @entity21 with 57 goals and 156 caps			1
' adding @entity1 to our @entity2 roster just before the @entity6 is a coup because he knows the @entity21 team better than anyone having played such a huge role in its success , especially at this event , ' said @entity85 , @entity2 's executive producer for @entity6 coverage			1
' @entity1 is also one of this country 's biggest sports stars , and we believe that he will help attract even more fans to our monthlong coverage			2
' difference of opinion : head coach @entity3 of the @entity21 walks the pitch during the @entity21 men 's @entity94 training session at @entity96 on june 11 , 2014 in @entity97 , @entity18 @entity1 wo n’t be traveling to @entity18 , instead broadcasting from @entity2 ’s studios in @entity100			1
last month , @entity1 thought he had earned a prominent role on the @entity21 @entity6 team right up until the moment he was cut from the roster by coach @entity3			1
@entity1 was still stunned and confused by @entity3 ’s decision when he went back to work with the @entity107 on saturday			1
i ’m sad , ' @entity1 said after being left out			2
' i ’m human , and i wanted to go			0
i really wanted to go			0
i ’m at peace with it			0
i just feel in my heart that i deserve to be there , and that ’s the pill that ’s hardest to swallow			0
' the 32 - year - old attacker was denied the chance to play in his fourth @entity6 after @entity3 chose @entity21 team newcomer @entity117 and 31 - year - old @entity118 over the most accomplished international player in @entity8 history			1
the decision surprised @entity1 , who believed a strong performance in training camp had secured his spot on the 23 - man roster			2
legend : @entity1 of @entity107 reacts to his supporters after a 4 - 1 win over the @entity129 at @entity130 on may 25 , 2014 in @entity100 , @entity131 but @entity1 declined to speculate on additional possible factors in the decision : his recent soccer sabbatical , the coach ’s decision to evaluate a versatile player solely as a forward , or the impact of the @entity8 ’ difficult group draw on their long - term planning			1
' i think if i ’m being judged solely on what happens in camp , then i absolutely deserved to be going to @entity18 , ' @entity1 said			1
' i firmly believe that not only should i be going , but i feel like i really deserved it , and not from anything that i did in the past , but from what i ’ve done in the last week and a half			2
' @entity1 gave little insight into whatever reasons @entity3 shared with him at the @entity152 training camp			1
@entity3 provided only murky details about his decision friday , saying other players were ' a little step ahead of @entity1 in certain areas			1
' ' i do n’t agree with that assessment , ' @entity1 said			2
' i think i was at least as good as everybody else in camp			0
... i think i was one of the better players , so that ’s why it stings a little			0
if i had gone in and did n’t feel like i deserved it , i could live with that			0
but that ’s not the case here			0
' @entity1 had nothing to say about any underlying implications of the mocking tweet by @entity171 , the coach ’s teenage son , moments after the announcement			2
' i do n’t really know his son well , so i ’m not really sure where that came from , ' @entity1 said			0
@entity1 is the leading scorer for the @entity21 men 's @entity94 with 57 goals and is seen here representing @entity107 @entity1 also does n’t think his four - month sabbatical from soccer in 2013 after the @entity107 ’s second straight @entity183 title should have worked against him			1
' i actually think i ’ve been a much better player since i came back , ' he said			0
@entity1 is the career @entity21 leader with 57 international goals , and is second with 156 appearances			1
he has scored five @entity6 goals , including a stoppage - time goal against @entity189 to send the @entity8 to the second round four years ago			0
instead of jetting off to @entity18 , the five - time @entity183 champion will resume his pursuit of the top @entity21 league ’s career goal - scoring record in sunday ’s home game against @entity196			1
@entity1 tied @entity198 ’s mark with his 134th goal late last season , but has n’t scored in seven matches with the @entity107 this year			0
' i ’m excited to be back here , ' @entity1 said			0
' i certainly did n’t want to be back here under these circumstances or this soon , but i love these guys			0
these are my teammates , and this is my home			0
i will not let this affect me going forward			0
' @entity1 said he would gladly return to the @entity21 team from the standby list if an injury created a spot on the roster , and he would n’t rule out playing for the @entity21 team in the future			1
he urged fans to support @entity3 ’s current squad because “ i do n’t want there to be a negative tint to any of this			2
” ' i ’ve always loved representing this country , so i ca n’t imagine that if i ’m given another opportunity that i would say no , ' @entity1 added			0
' but at this point , i ’m just trying to deal with the disappointment			0
