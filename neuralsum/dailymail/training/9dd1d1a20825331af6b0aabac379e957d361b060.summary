by @entity0 published : 13:03 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 05:04 est , 3 july 2012 her elaborate , meringue - shaped wedding gowns are on every young @entity4 's wish - list , the unabashed stars in each episode of @entity7			1
but when @entity9 dressmaker @entity8 decided to teach the young traveller brides who commission her skills how to make dresses themselves , she faced her biggest , fattest challenge yet			1
dressmaker extraordinaire : @entity8 at work on one of her typically extravagant gowns mrs @entity8 , who is in her 50s , discovered the girls had very few social skills , clung to her like much younger children , rarely knew what day of the week it was and were , for the most part , illiterate			1
some did n't even know how to tell the time			0
speaking to the @entity24 , mrs @entity8 said : ' after the first day i cried my eyes out and thought , " what have i done ? "			2
' my vision was to see them all sat in lines sewing and me saying , " this is how you do it "			0
' what i did n't realise is they do n't act like 16 or 17 - year - olds - they were more like 10 or 11 - year - olds because they finished school at 11			1
' hard work : two of @entity8 's gypsy students cut out fabric for their wedding frocks mrs @entity8 launched her fashion academy in her @entity9 shop as a thank - you to the girls who have contributed to her success , selecting 10 inexperienced teenagers and endeavoring to teach them how to make a spectacular wedding dress of their own in just six months			1
she said : ' there are so many girls who want a job			0
maybe they do n't work because they 've never had that opportunity			0
i really do want to do this			0
' the travellers have helped put me where i am today and this is my way of giving something back			0
' but teaching the girls - whose progress is documented in @entity66 's upcoming spin - off , @entity8 's @entity63 - was much tougher than she had expected			1
as well as dealing with squabbles and excitability , mrs @entity8 also found herself up against extraordinarily poor levels of numeracy and literacy - many of the girls struggled with the numbers on tape measures and were even unable to use calculators			2
pink lady : @entity78 , 16 , says her boyfriend disapproves of her working but that @entity8 has been like a second mother to her she brought in a tutor to help the girls with their reading and writing , and stuck up paper clocks on the walls to help them recognise times			2
since the girls are paid for their work , she also had to teach them about tax and national insurance			0
mrs @entity8 soon realised that traveller girls are never expected to have jobs , rather that their lives are set on a path which includes only marrying young and having children			2
many of their families and boyfriends even disapprove of the girls having jobs			0
the project is meant to teach the girls that having a trade is invaluable in life , however prescribed your destiny may be			0
dressing up : traveller student @entity110 during one of her lessons with dressmaker @entity8 some students in the show include 16 - year - old @entity117 traveller @entity118 , who instantly makes an impression with her boisterous ways and wilful attitude ; @entity110 , an @entity124 traveller who was bullied at school and is keen to do well on the course ; and @entity117 @entity128 who is suspended from the course when she does something @entity8 describes as ' pure evil '			1
dress - making divas : @entity133 , left , and @entity134 , right , are two of @entity8 's traveller students @entity8 - who is not herself a gypsy , just a dressmaker whose clients happen , mostly , to be gypsies - has been running her dressmaking business , @entity142 , since 1998			2
she shot to fame after creating a wedding dress weighing 21 - stone for a 15 - year - old bride and attracting the attention of local @entity9 press and tv producers			1
her success followed a period of turbulence which included being imprisoned for four months in 2001 after receiving a 12 - month jail sentence for benefit fraud to the tune of Â£ 10,700 she committed for 11 months between 1996 and 1997			0
material girls : @entity8 's gigantic , sequin - riddled designs are on every @entity159 bride 's ' must have ' list larger than life : @entity8 's over-the - top wedding dresses are the stars of @entity66 's documentary @entity7 material girls : @entity8 will teach her 10 students how to make a wedding dress of their own in six months @entity8 's @entity63 begins on sunday , july 8 , at 9pm on @entity66			1

@entity7 dressmaker @entity8 ended her first day teaching in @entity9 crying
girls of 17 have *educational* level and social skills of 10 - year - olds
