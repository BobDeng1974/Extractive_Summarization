by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 02:41 est , 27 february 2014 @entity4 : 04:30 est , 27 february 2014 @entity5 was warned by the government today that it should not go ahead with paying £ 576million in staff bonuses while it is still recieving ' life support ' from the taxpayer			1
deputy prime minister @entity11 said that while the bank 's survival depends on the generosity of the @entity17 public , it had to be ' restrained , sensible and responsible ' in setting pay deals			1
the troubled bank reignited the row over pay when it revealed plans for huge bonuses , including £ 237million for its investment bankers , despite slumping into the red with an £ 8.2billion loss			1
controversial : @entity5 revealed a staff bonus pot of £ 576m for 2013 ( pictured is its @entity30 headquarters ) the bonus pot is slightly smaller than the £ 679million haul for 2012 , although this in part was a result of job losses from its investment banking team			1
mr @entity11 said @entity5 ' is not a normal bank ' because it is ' not able to stand on its own two feet '			1
he told @entity41 's @entity40 : ' a loss - making bank that is basically on the kind of life support system because of the generosity of @entity17 taxpayers should n’t be dishing out ever larger amounts of money in pay and bonuses and , you know , it needs to continue to come down			2
' they are entitled to pay their staff what they want when they are standing on their own two feet , at the moment they are not			0
' as long as you ’re there because the @entity17 public have been generous to keep you in existence , be restrained , be sensible , be responsible in the kind of remuneration			0
' i think in @entity5 ’ case it ’s different , of course there will be bonuses but it is really important those bonuses are as restrained and limited as possible			1
' the taxpayer - backed lender agreed the bonus windfall with @entity76 , the body charged with managing government stakes in banks , according to @entity80			0
deputy pm @entity11 the losses of the taxpayer - backed lender , which is just over 80 per cent owned by the government , have widened significantly from £ 5.3billion in 2012			1
it includes £ 3.8billion set aside for a string of scandal - related charges and a £ 4.8billion hit for the creation of an internal ‘ bad bank ’			2
@entity89 , @entity90 ’s shadow treasury minister , said : ' taxpayers will be incredulous that such large bonuses continue to be paid out at a time when huge losses are being made			1
' with bumper bonuses across a number of banks this year the government should now repeat @entity90 ’s successful tax on bank bonuses			2
' @entity101 should also make clear now that he would reject any request from @entity5 later this year for approval to pay bonuses of more than 100 per cent of salary			1
' at a time when ordinary families are facing a cost - of - living crisis and bank lending to business is down it can not be justified			0
' admission : @entity113 , chief executive of @entity5 ( left ) , says the bank is paying for past mistakes			1
long - lasting damage was done to the bank by @entity118 ( right ) , who was in charge between 2001 and 2009 but chief executive @entity113 outlined a revival plan to make the bank ‘ smaller , simpler and smarter ’ that will see it shrink from seven divisions to three and overhaul its service and products for retail customers			0
the massive black hole illustrates the long - lasting damage done by @entity130 's leadership before the bank was bailed out with £ 45billion of taxpayers ’ money in 2008			2
mr @entity113 , who took over from @entity134 at the start of october 2013 , said recently that the bank and its directors were paying the price for past errors			2
‘ i know this team is not responsible for past mistakes but we are running the company and have to show we take accountability seriously , ’ he said			0
‘ fronting up to our past mistakes is very expensive , but @entity5 is now a stronger bank			2
’ he did not name mr @entity130 , who in 2012 was stripped of the knighthood given to him by @entity146			0
but he blamed the aggressive expansionism of the bank , one of its key characteristics under mr @entity130 ’s leadership			0
deputy prime minister @entity11 said @entity5 was ' in a different category ' from other banks because it is largely taxpayer - owned and should show restraint on pay and bonuses			1
mr @entity11 told @entity157 's @entity40 : ' a loss - making bank that is basically on a life - support system because of the generosity of @entity17 taxpayers should n't be dishing out ever larger amounts of money in pay and bonuses			1
' the overall amount has been coming down			0
it needs to continue to come down			0
