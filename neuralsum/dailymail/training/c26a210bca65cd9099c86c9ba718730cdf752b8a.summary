anyone who has witnessed the intensity of @entity2 at close quarters will not be surprised that numerically he 's been the most effective striker in the @entity5 in 2014			1
but they might have been a little shocked to hear him say on saturday that tallies do not always matter			1
‘ i really do n’t care about statistics , ’ he said in frustration after his 18th goal of the calendar year could only contribute to a 1 - 1 draw against @entity14			1
the wider context was a statement of the obvious that goals without wins mean less			1
but to underestimate how much goals and numbers mean to him would be a mistake			1
@entity2 celebrates his goal against @entity14 at the @entity25 on saturday the @entity27 's strike made him the highest scorer in the @entity5 this calendar year @entity2 - 18 @entity30 - 16 @entity31 - 14 @entity32 - 14 @entity33 - 13 @entity34 - 13 in january of this year , when @entity35 spent an hour with the @entity27 in a function room at the @entity25 , he spelled out the point			1
the speech came in response to a question about the flawed public perception that @entity43 ’s £ 12million record signing that summer was an easy - going guy			1
' i have to be in control , ' he said			2
' at this point he brought his fist down against the table			2
' i am a hard person - i am not an easy guy			2
i want always to be in control , everything i do in football and outside			2
' at the end of the season i want to do this , after next season i want to do that			2
i know who can help me , who ca n't help me			0
the people who can help , from the beginning i talk to them - " i want that and that - you have to help me			0
and if you help me , i help you "			0
' i like to use my power			0
wherever we go , in the disco or anywhere , i am always talking about this every day			0
' i always tell my friends - @entity76 , ( @entity34 ) @entity77 , @entity78 - if you have time to put in a cross do it because you know i am good with my head			1
you do n't have to be in the box , give me the ball			0
@entity2 's strike past @entity86 was his 18th in the @entity5 this calendar year @entity2 , pictured scoring at @entity90 last season , was the subject of interest from @entity93 this summer video we are doing well - @entity95 ' if i head the ball one time it can be a goal			1
i try to be there in the right place			0
if i am not there , it is my mistake			0
‘ @entity104 texts me to say , “ do n't let anyone destroy your objectives ”			0
my objective is 20 goals with @entity43 this season , then the @entity111 and in the future i want to play the @entity113			1
no one will destroy my objectives			0
’ so that is why goals matter to @entity2			1
at the time of the interview he had 13 , having struggled initially to get regular game time under @entity122 , who had preferred other striking targets that summer			2
by the end of the season he had scored 25 and went to the @entity111			2
he has six goals already in this campaign			2
will he get his move to the @entity113 ? that remains to be seen , but it would be naive to assume that the contract extension he signed last month signals an end to his ambitions			0
@entity2 left @entity137 side @entity136 in 2013 to join @entity43 in a £ 12million move bony in action for @entity27 against @entity141 at the @entity142 in @entity143 @entity2 and his camp have been admirably and contentiously open about his intentions			1
yes , he enjoys playing for @entity43 in the @entity5 and he will not agitate to leave as he did at @entity136 before heading to @entity146			1
but if a big opportunity came along , it is understood that he would want to take it			0
at a time when answers are heavily scrutinised by supporters and media alike , it is risky for a player or associate to state what might sound like the obvious			0
but why should an @entity27 have an unbreakable bond with a club in @entity146 ? he likes the club , is happy there and is paid above the going rate for @entity43 ’s leading players			1
but those objectives he talks of will not be broken by a one - year extension to 2018 , which was designed with the heavy objective of addressing the £ 19m buyout clause that would have landed a rival – most likely @entity93 – with a huge bargain			2
@entity30 has scored 16 times in 2014 for @entity172 and helped them clinch the title @entity32 scored his 14th goal of the calendar year during @entity172 's 3 - 0 win at @entity178 @entity31 has scored 14 goals this calendar , including some key strikes in @entity172 's title challenge as @entity43 ’s deal with @entity136 in 2013 included clauses of a further £ 1.75m , based on performances , it is safe to assume they might have only made a profit of £ 5.25m on such a revelatory signing			1
with extra security , @entity43 can , in the event of an approach , expect a significant return for a proven goal scorer who only turns 26 later this month			1
the goals record of 30 in 75 games for @entity196 , 53 in 73 for @entity136 and 31 in 62 for @entity43 would , quite conceivably , make him worth upwards of £ 30m			1
on the list of the 10 top scorers for 2014 , he is the only player who finished last season in a club outside the top 10			2
would his effectiveness and value go up in a bigger club ? @entity33 has found the back of the net 13 times this year , but has struggled with injury problems @entity34 , who has scored 13 league goals in 2014 , has found a new lease of life as @entity214 captain @entity215 has struggled with injury problems but scored 10 league goals in this calendar year in that same interview , @entity2 detailed the resistance he faced from his father , a teacher , to his dream of being a footballer			1
he said : ‘ he wanted me to continue in school			0
he paid for me to go to this school for a year but i said , " i do n't want that , i want to play football so do n't pay anything "			0
' he would say , " go to school and after that you can play			0
there are other people , like doctors , who play football "			0
‘ but i said , " @entity236 , no. everyone has a destiny "			0
he said , " i understand that but this is your problem now "			0
man , he went * * * * * * * crazy			0
’ suffice to say , @entity2 was smart to keep his objectives			1
@entity244 - 33 ( @entity245 ) @entity246 - 30 ( @entity247 ) @entity248 - 18 ( @entity249 ) @entity250 - 20 ( @entity251 ) @entity252 - 17 ( @entity253 ) @entity254 - 16 ( @entity255 ) @entity256 - 17 ( @entity257 ) @entity258 - 15 ( @entity259 / @entity260 ) @entity261 - 14 ( @entity263 / @entity262 ) @entity264 - 14 ( @entity265 ) @entity266 - 19 ( @entity267 ) @entity268 - 18 ( @entity269 ) @entity270 - 17 ( @entity271 ) @entity272 - 17 ( @entity273 )			1
