by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:30 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 10:57 est , 19 july 2013 the entire @entity2 was sent into a panic thinking that the royal baby had arrived during a meeting at @entity6			0
but the piece of paper rushed into a meeting yesterday was not an update from the palace but the latest from @entity12 's			2
the prime minister had instructed officials to keep him informed of the score from the @entity17 match between @entity18 and @entity19			1
mix - up : @entity21 , who spent the day watching the second @entity17 test at @entity23 , revealed on @entity24 that yesterday 's cabinet meeting was disrupted by an update on the match chilling : @entity21 was in the stands at @entity23 for the second @entity17 test as mps began their six - week @entity21 revealed how royal baby fever swept through his senior ministers as he spent the day at @entity12 ’s watching day two of the second @entity17 test			1
as mps began their six - week summer recess , the @entity13 rushed to @entity12 ’s in north @entity36 to catch @entity18 batting their way to 361 all out			1
speaking on @entity39 ’s @entity38 during the lunch break , mr @entity21 revealed how his interest in yesterday 's match had triggered panic around the @entity2 table			1
he said : ‘ we had a @entity2 meeting and i asked someone to bring in the cricket score half way through just to see how it was going			0
‘ and a bit of paper arrived in the @entity2 room and everyone of course thought it was an announcement about the royal baby			0
‘ there was a great intake of breath and actually it was because @entity61 wanted to know what the score was because he was meant to be at @entity23			2
’ where 's @entity65 ? the prime minister was surrounded by ordinary fans as he watched @entity18 all out for 361 unusually cabinet ministers held their weekly meeting at @entity6 , the prime minister ’s country retreat , yesterday instead of in @entity72			1
the stately pile boasts tennis courts and a swimming pool but mr @entity21 ’s official spokesman denied it was a ‘ jolly ’			1
today the prime minister seemed delighted to have started parliament 's long summer break with a few hours in the sunshine watching the cricket			1
he said : ' it 's such a glorious sight coming here , the sun shining , @entity18 playing well			1
' it always such a wonderful thing to see			0
i was a bit late and thought this morning that i would n't see @entity18 batting			2
' asked by former cricketer and broadcaster @entity91 to join him at to watch a match at @entity93 , mr @entity21 replied : ' we could have a day when we cancel @entity95 and all come to the cricket			1
' spotted : cricket fans turn around to see the famous face in the row behind them hook : mr @entity21 watches intently from the stands at @entity12 's cricket ground in north @entity36 thirsty work : mr @entity21 sips from a water bottle as play continues ahead of the @entity17 mr @entity21 hailed the competition as the ‘ big one ’ and warned @entity110 had ‘ high hopes ’ for @entity112 ’s side as it took on the @entity113 ’s			1
he added : ‘ now whether you remember @entity116 and @entity117 at @entity93 , like i do , or @entity119 ’s defiant stance at the @entity120 in 2005 - i remember where i was when that happened - nothing captures the public ’s imagination quite like a test match against @entity19			1
‘ the nation ’s got high hopes			0
we ’re right behind the team , and i ’m sure they ’re going to rise to the occasion			0
’ the visit to the cricket is just the start of a long summer for mr @entity21 , who has previously been accused of spending too long chillaxing			1
he is expected to take two holidays this summer - one in @entity136 and one in @entity138 – in the middle of his campaign against independence			1
deputy prime minister @entity142 will be away at the same time , leaving @entity143 and @entity144 in charge of the country			1
the @entity13 and his deputy are to leave the country on holiday at the same time this summer – despite having six weeks to ensure one of them stays in charge of the country			2
mr @entity142 revealed earlier this month that he had been unable to co-ordinate his family holiday so it did not clash with the @entity154 ’ , and other ministers will be left to ‘ hold the fort ’			2
after leaving @entity12 's the prime minister travelled to the @entity158 to hand out goody bags to @entity160 who were there to celebrate one year on from the @entity160 and @entity163 every year mr @entity142 and his family go to the same village in @entity166 where his wife @entity168 ’s family is from			1
they will be accompanied by their three children @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174			0
but like millions of schoolchildren , @entity175 could n’t wait to start their six week summer holiday last night			2
but without the chance to watch a dvd or play @entity181 on the green benches of the @entity183 hardly any politicians bothered turning up for the last day of the parliamentary term			2
maybe @entity175 can be forgiven for needing a break – it has been a whole month since the last time the @entity187 had a recess			0
at 5.20pm yesterday commons @entity189 moved to adjourn the @entity183 until september 2			1
it means there will be no new legislation , no debates and no prime minister ’s questions for six long weeks			1
@entity175 argue they will spend the summer working in their constituencies			2
with the general election now less than two years away , those with the smallest majorities would be sensible to use the time to win over more voters			0
however the chance to get away for a holiday – or two – will prove too great for most			0
as the @entity187 wound down yesterday it seemed most mps have started their break early			0
fewer than 50 of the 650 mps turned out to see business secretary @entity208 answer questions on the economy at 9.30am			0
clash : mr @entity21 will be on holiday at the same time as his deputy @entity142 this summer , leaving @entity143 and @entity144 in charge by 1.30pm the numbers had dwindled to a couple of dozen for a debate on an @entity218 - @entity217			1
as the clock ticked on to 4pm the number of @entity175 left for a general debate was struggling to get into double figures			0
and just three were left when @entity224 mp @entity223 had a debate on @entity226			0
10.02am : on the last day of term yesterday just a few dozen @entity175 turned up in the @entity187 to grill business secretary @entity208 1.37pm : by lunchtime they were struggling to get into double figures on the green benches 5pm : with most people still hard at work in the country , just three mps could be seen in the @entity187 chamber before it packed up for the summer in 2012 - 13 the @entity187 sat just 145 times , the second lowest figure since 1945 for a year where there was not a general election			2
some in @entity240 predict it could be even lower this year			0
@entity242 , chief executive of the @entity243 ’ @entity241 , said : ‘ any mp worth their salt will be busy in their constituency during the summer recess			0
‘ however , the long break means that ministers will get away without being scrutinised in @entity251 for six whole weeks by the people we elect to hold them to account			0
‘ week in , week out , we see debates on important legislation being curtailed as a result of strict timetable motions , which means @entity258 are getting passed by mps without having been subject to detailed scrutiny			0
‘ this is bad for democracy and reducing the length of the recesses would make more time available for the @entity187 to properly debate new laws and hold the government to account			0
