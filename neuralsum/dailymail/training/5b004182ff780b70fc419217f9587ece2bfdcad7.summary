@entity0 squeaked past the 10 men of @entity2 and here , @entity3 gives his verdict on what they did well and where it went wrong			1
@entity11 is praised , @entity9 and @entity10 come in for criticism ... but there is encouragement for goalscorer @entity15			1
@entity16 's @entity0 's middle man there was a lot of rotation in the midfield diamond , but @entity11 needs to become the main man in the holding role			1
@entity11 is our most technically gifted player so it makes sense for him to play there			1
on sunday evening he was fluid in attack and was involved all over the pitch , as his touch map ( right ) shows			0
he also had more touches ( 66 ) in the opposition half than in his own ( 36 )			0
that ’s fine against 10 - man @entity2 but there needs to be a balance			2
too much rotation and the midfield becomes a carousel that better teams will exploit			0
up the pace to break down 10 men when you are playing 10 men , you need to move the ball more quickly to work your opponents across the pitch			1
@entity0 should have tried to restrict themselves to two touches before moving it on			1
@entity2 never looked isolated and that is more our fault than their ability			0
@entity9 has to be more selfish sometimes @entity9 is too honest for his own good			2
he ’s such a willing runner for the team but i ’d like to see him be more selfish			0
it ’s difficult with two up front but most of his good work was done out wide , away from that central position where can do the damage			0
@entity9 down after being fouled - sometimes he needs to stop running and stay in a central position @entity15 misses a chance to double @entity0 's lead in added time - but he did earlier score the winner @entity15 's our leader - do n't hammer him i do n’t think we should be too harsh on @entity15			1
he missed some good chances but he is our captain and scored an important goal			1
playing abroad is always a test , especially with a young team , and @entity15 is our leader			2
@entity83 needs to play with more freedom @entity10 needs to take the handbrake off			0
for @entity86 he is such a creative force but in an @entity0 shirt he loses that freedom			2
on the opposite flank @entity90 may have given the ball away , but he kept going even when things went wrong			0
@entity10 needs to show more because his attacking instincts make him the player he is for @entity86			0
@entity10 ( centre ) , reacting to a decision given against him , plays with less freedom for @entity0			2

@entity11 is @entity0 's most technically gifted player
@entity0 need to move the ball more quickly against 10 men
@entity9 needs to stop doing so much running
@entity15 missed chances but also scored an important goal
