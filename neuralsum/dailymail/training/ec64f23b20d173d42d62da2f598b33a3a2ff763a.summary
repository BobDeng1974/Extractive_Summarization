for some , it ’ll be the best present they have had in years			2
but could this year ’s must - have gadget cause a fatal accident or , worse , help a terrorist to launch a deadly attack ? walk around any @entity8 electronics shop this @entity9 and you ’ll see the shelves stacked with strangely - shaped flying machines			1
the remote - controlled devices , officially described as ‘ multi-copters ’ or ‘ unmanned aerial vehicles ’ , are usually known by a much more recognisable name : drones			1
these do n’t drop bombs or monitor enemy troop movements			2
they look like giant @entity30 - built spiders , but are essentially a 21st - century version of the remote - control aeroplane you might have played with as a child			1
the modern - day toys hover and whizz and swoop through the air			1
and they ’re flying off the shelves			2
it is estimated that more than 30,000 drones will have been bought by @entity21 consumers by the end of the year — a high proportion of them as @entity9 presents			1
the electronics chain @entity47 says that sales within its stores are up 300 per cent on 2013			0
but as drones move from the battlefield into our back gardens and parks , serious questions are increasingly being asked about their safety			0
this week , it emerged that a passenger jet was involved in a near miss with a drone near @entity61 in july			1
the pilot was flying at an altitude of 700ft when he saw the unauthorised machine , which was invisible to radar , flying near his plane			1
there was a similar incident at @entity69 two months earlier — and more recently a @entity71 pilot reported seeing a drone as he came in to land at @entity74 ’s @entity73			1
frightening stuff , given that if a drone were sucked into a jet plane ’s engine , it could have the same effect as a bird strike , which might prove catastrophic on take - off or landing			1
drones have been put to other dangerous uses , too			0
in october , a @entity87 football match between @entity88 and @entity89 descended into a riot after a drone was deliberately flown inside the stadium in @entity93 trailing an @entity89 flag , much to the fury of the @entity88			1
and sometimes they simply end up causing accidents			1
in @entity74 this week , a @entity99 friday ’s restaurant used a hovering drone dangling a piece of mistletoe to encourage dining couples to kiss each other			1
unfortunately , after colliding with one woman ’s hand , it took a lump out of her nose			0
@entity110 is a carbon fibre aircraft which folds into a v while flying so the built - in @entity113 camera can take awe - inspiring 360 - degree footage however , a more serious issue relating to drones is their ability to invade just about anyone ’s privacy			1
because it ’s possible to attach a camera to them , it is relatively simple to fly over someone ’s property and take a picture of whatever they might happen to be doing in private			0
indeed , paparazzi drones have become @entity132 ’s most feared gate - crashers , deploying long - lens cameras and video recorders over the private retreats of the stars			1
one of those to complain vociferously was the singer @entity138 , who spotted one hovering over her garden			0
oscar - winner @entity142 ’s actress wife @entity141 has also reported seeing them flying over her property			1
as a result of such intrusions , @entity22 law - makers are seeking to extend privacy laws to include the use of drones			1
the @entity151 nano unmanned aerial drone , made by @entity21 company @entity153 international , in @entity155 , @entity156 in @entity21 , there are strict regulations on where and how you can fly one			1
but there ’s no doubt the rules are regularly breached by negligent fliers who may not have thought out the possible consequences			0
and what about those with more malicious intent ? if a troublemaker can send a drone into a football stadium , and other users can fly them near airports , one can only imagine the harm that could potentially be inflicted by an extremist whose aim is to bring down an airliner			1
the @entity182 , the same agency that governs commercial airlines , is in charge of drawing up and enforcing the regulations around drones			0
it declines to comment on the security implications of the @entity61 incident , but its official guidance on the use of drones is stiffly worded : ‘ unmanned aircraft , irrespective of their size , are still classified as aircraft — they are not toys			0
’ it adds : ‘ the person in charge of operating the controls of an unmanned aircraft is referred to as the pilot			0
’ the @entity182 rules forbid you from flying your drone within 50m ( 164ft ) of any ‘ person , vessel , vehicle or structure not under the control of the pilot ’			1
flying too close to a building , for example , is a breach of @entity215 of the @entity216 and the maximum penalty is a £ 2,500 fine			0
you must also keep the machine within sight at all times — which the @entity182 interprets as meaning you ’re not allowed to fly your machine at any altitude higher than 400ft			0
the problem is that though the @entity182 says drones are not toys , that ’s not the view of most owners			0
the regulations should stop most people from flying their drone in their back garden or their local park			2
but how strictly is the law enforced ? the @entity182 admits there have only ever been two convictions — one man was ordered to pay £ 300 for flying a drone over some rides at @entity241 ( while he was standing in the car park )			2
another was fined £ 800 for flying a drone too close to a bridge , and near a nuclear submarine site ( a separate offence )			2
but the first lawbreaker was caught only because he ’d posted video footage on @entity251 which had been shot from his drone , and the second was nabbed because he ’d inadvertently filmed his car number plate as the drone took off			2
neither was apprehended at the time of the offence			0
realistically , how many local police officers are going to know the detail of the law if they see someone playing with a drone in his local park ? so will the strict laws dampen demand ? it ’s unlikely			1
@entity99 friday 's has launched the country 's first mistletoe drone - which can travel up to 35mph - and hovers above customers in a bid to spark some romance ‘ this is the year that drones have moved into the mainstream , ’ says @entity272 , owner of @entity273 in @entity274 , which has been selling flying toys for four decades			1
‘ that ’s because you can buy a really good drone for a relatively small amount , with a good camera , that ’s ready to fly as soon as you take it out of the box			2
’ for less than £ 50 , you can buy a battery - powered drone with four motors that ’ll do whatever you command it to			1
for a little more money , your drone will hover perfectly still , then loop the loop , all the while beaming back broadcast - quality video of the landscape below			1
you can see the appeal			0
these machines are great fun to play with — if a little daunting at first			0
couples put their cutlery down to kiss each other as it flew 8ft above tables at the @entity302 restaurant earlier this year , i got my hands on a top - of - the - range model being used by a farmer to scare birds away from his crops			1
( at least , that was his story — his main motivation appeared to be bossing about this extraordinary beast as it whizzed and buzzed its merry path through the sky , swooping down to the crops below			0
) he let me have a go , and it was an amazing thrill : i felt like a master of the universe			0
the noise ! the power ! not all drones are as hefty and macho as that			0
the cheapest on the market , the @entity324 , costs less than £ 30 and fits in the palm of your hand , which means it is small and light enough for you to fly it indoors			0
less giant spider , more an oversized ( and playful ) flea			0
the little @entity324 ca n’t really cope in anything stronger than a breeze , but the more you spend , the sturdier your drone gets			2
and at the higher - end of the scale , the models come with @entity340 , the same satellite positioning system that your car ’s satnav relies on			2
it means the drone knows its precise position in space at every moment , and it automatically compensates for any change in windspeed by returning to the same spot if it ’s blown sideways			2
as a result , it can hover and take photographs from the same place			0
so will all the thousands of people who get a drone for @entity9 really abide by the regulations ? @entity361 , managing director of @entity362 , says : ‘ we would n’t want any of our customers thinking that it ’s a good idea to put a drone over @entity61 , because that ’s clearly a very irresponsible thing to do			2
’ he says that @entity47 makes sure all customers are made aware of the law			0
‘ but if they then choose to disregard the law , that is for them to decide			0
’ of course , if you see a drone fitted with a camera hovering over your garden , there ’s one drastic measure you could resort to : shoot it down			2
now , where did i put my shotgun			0

up to 30,000 of the remote - controlled devices predicted to be sold this year
this week it emerged passenger plane had near miss with drone in july
in october drone was used to disrupt @entity88 vs @entity89 football match
some believe stricter laws must be introduced to prevent *future* accidents
