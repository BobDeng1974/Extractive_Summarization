@entity0 has been gainfully involved in football management for more than 30 years			1
his successes have been few but his employment has been regular			1
this is because he understands how the game works			1
in particular , he understands the art of self - preservation			2
his performance after @entity10 ’s latest defeat was taken straight from the play - book he helped to write			1
@entity10 are a desperately poor side and two years of @entity0 ’s stewardship has not improved them			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity0 at the press conference in which he hit out at @entity18 for being unfit to play @entity18 , about three stones overweight said @entity0 , wears gloves and a hat in @entity10 training they were unfortunate to lose to @entity24 but the reality is that they are bottom of the @entity28 with just four points from 24			1
it was time for a desperate manager to seek a diversion and @entity0 found it in an innocent query about his non-selection of @entity18			1
the resulting rant deserves to be enshrined in gothic script			2
‘ i ca n’t protect people who do n’t want to run and train and are about three stone overweight , ’ declared @entity0			1
‘ @entity18 ’s not injured			1
he ’s not fit to play football , unfortunately			1
what am i supposed to keep saying ? keep getting your £ 60,000 , £ 70,000 and do n’t train ? what ’s the game coming to ? ’ there was more in that populist vein but we sensed , not for the first time , that reality might shortly raise its voice			2
and @entity18 ’s response was devastating			1
far from being ‘ three stone overweight , ’ he was athletically trim			1
he stepped on the scales and posed for pictures to make his point			2
he also added a fascinating insight into @entity0 ’s managerial methods : ‘ he spends most of the time in his office but , when he gets off the phone , he comes down to watch for five or 10 minutes — he never takes a session			1
the training sessions are n’t the same standard as @entity63 , or what i would expect under another manager			1
’ @entity18 shows off his physique to @entity68 photographer @entity67 in response to @entity0 's insults now if you were seeking a standard bearer for the ideal professional , then the unpredictable @entity18 may not be your man			1
but he does not deserve to have his reputation spitefully smeared by a panicking manager			1
by now , @entity0 was pinned to the ropes , yet managed to prattle : ‘ the only reason he has lost weight is because he has had tonsillitis — even i could suck my stomach in for a picture and look ok ’			1
tonsillitis ! even by @entity0 ’s standards , it was preposterous			1
either he had discovered the ultimate slimming aid , or he had been caught out in a fantasy			2
judging by the derisive laughter , the public had made up its mind			2
@entity10 chairman @entity91 apologised to fans for the ‘ embarrassment ’ caused by the ludicrous spat and spoke of his ‘ disappointment ’ with both manager and player			1
and we sensed that @entity91 may have found the episode strangely revealing			2
as the entrepreneurial driving force behind the successful @entity103 budget airline , he clearly has some awareness of the importance of tranquil relationships between employer and employees			2
certainly , he will not have been familiar with the 19th - century approach to industrial relations which @entity112 football has unthinkingly embraced			2
@entity18 posted this image on his @entity114 showing himself working hard on a bike during training @entity18 attacks the @entity118 defence during @entity10 's @entity120 second round match in august ever since @entity0 came into the game , more than half a century ago , he has learned to regard the manager as the ultimate autocrat			1
his word is law , his authority is absolute			2
privately , a player may think him wrong , foolish or simply incompetent , but such thoughts are never voiced			2
for he is the manager , the ‘ boss ’ , the ‘ gaffer ’ , ordained by custom and practice			1
and if that gaffer should decide to hurl a few public insults at a player who may have displeased him , well , that is his @entity137 - given right			2
those employees are rather better rewarded these days ; ‘ £ 60,000 , £ 70,000 ’ , as @entity0 resentfully revealed			1
but the essential relationship is unchanged ; they are still expected to doff their metaphorical cloth caps to the mill - owner , who can make or break them with a single , vengeful phrase			2
and they are expected to accept this dickensian code without a whisper of protest			2
in truth , it is a feudal system which demeans the players and deludes the managers			2
but football at large has known no other way and managers like @entity0 are patently content with that situation			1
@entity0 's style subscribes to an outdated @entity158 management model that demeans players mercifully , the worm is starting to turn			1
the players ’ sense of self respect is beginning to match their professional status			2
the @entity18 case is a poor example , since he has no future with @entity10 and therefore has little to lose			1
but other , more reflective , footballers increasingly deplore a system which demands such archaic deference			0
it is said that , in the closing years of his time at @entity174 , sir @entity172 was steadily moving away from the old methods			0
tea cups no longer flew , boots were no longer kicked and the hair - dryer was returned to its case			0
players , in particular foreign players , were not prepared to be routinely insulted in that fashion			0
and @entity172 was a brilliantly talented , overwhelmingly successful football manager			1
if stars such as @entity172 could see the way the game was changing , then functionaries like @entity0 have no excuse for their insulting ignorance			1
‘ what ’s the game coming to ? ’ , he blustered			0
perhaps it is time that somebody told him ... how did @entity194 think he ’d tame a £ 16m turkey ? it is a truth universally acknowledged that football managers know more about the game than football fans			0
it is just possible that some managers may know even more about the game than football writers			0
so how on earth can an enormously accomplished manager like @entity194 make the kind of error that comes complete with neon lights and a government health warning ? @entity194 is an astute and accomplished manager , but then he signed £ 16m turkey @entity210 ... the list of @entity210 ’s misdemeanours would fill a charge sheet			1
managers of the stature of @entity217 and @entity218 repeatedly tried and ultimately failed to harness his fitful talent , @entity217 declaring him ‘ unmanageable ’			0
and yet , just a week before the close of the last transfer window , @entity194 convinced himself that he could handle the player			1
so he handed @entity63 £ 16million , and bought himself a turkey			0
now in the real world , £ 16m is regarded as rather a lot of money			0
but in the neverland of the @entity28 , it may be seen as no more than a punt , a throw of the dice			0
@entity210 , during another bad day out for @entity24 against @entity234 on saturday , has been dubbed ' unmanageable ' if @entity210 comes off , it ’s a coup			0
if not , well , we can always move him on			0
and yet , when the signing was made , there was something in @entity194 ’ remarks which hinted at uncertainty			0
‘ i do not have any concerns , ’ he said			0
‘ he comes in with a reputation but we hope we can curb that behaviour … he knows his flaws … it is a calculated risk but i hope we can improve him as a player and mature him as a young man			0
we think he can do very well for us			0
’ when @entity24 went three goals down to @entity253 the other evening , the coldly disdainful reaction of @entity210 ’s colleagues told us precisely how well the experiment was going			0
@entity210 failed to finish from three yards as @entity24 drew a blank against @entity234 he wore his indolence like a uniform , and that pantomime piece of shirt - swapping at half - time told us just how much he cared			0
so abject was his performance that , in his club ’s biggest match of the season so far , he could not be risked for the second half			0
obviously , @entity210 is not the only reason for the current problems at @entity268			0
but he was the avoidable error , the misguided hunch , the £ 16m mistake which should never have been made			0
we are not wise after the event , because everyone from fans to scribblers to the dogs in the street sensed it when he was signed			0
yet @entity194 went ahead with the deal			0
and now he must cope with the consequences			0
@entity281 disturbing news from deepest @entity283 , where @entity284 , the @entity286 mascot , is accused of calling his own club supporters ‘ a bunch of c * * * * ’ and challenging them to a fight			0
the distressing incident took place at @entity293 last weekend			1
@entity284 , aka @entity294 , denies the charges , which the club describe as ‘ an exchange of views ’			0
@entity286 mascot @entity284 the @entity301 is alleged to have sworn at his own fans and challenged them to a fight i ’ve often wondered what impels people to dress as a teddy bear , an octopus , or even a seagull , in order to watch football on saturday afternoons			0
do they take the bus ? do they pay full fare ? and those fans whom @entity284 allegedly insulted : how did they feel when they got home ? ‘ nice day at the football , dear ? ’ ‘ not really			0
some foul - mouthed seagull tried to pick a fight			0
what ’s for tea ? ’			0

@entity0 said @entity18 was ' about three stone overweight '
the @entity10 manager 's *outburst* came at a press conference last week
@entity18 showed off his trim physique and said he 's ready to play
the incident smack of a desperate manager trying to seek a diversion
