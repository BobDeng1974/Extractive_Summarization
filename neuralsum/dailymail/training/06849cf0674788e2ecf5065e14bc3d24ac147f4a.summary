by @entity0 published : 19:16 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 19:17 est , 29 january 2014 deeply unsettling hidden camera footage that shows unsupervised children actually pointing guns left unattended towards their own faces has been released			1
the video was shot by @entity7 as an experiment to highlight a new study published in the medical journal @entity11 that has revealed 10,000 @entity13 children are injured or killed by guns each year			1
despite being given gun safety lessons just days before at their @entity17 , @entity18 , school , some children approach the guns and wave them around for minutes before calling for help from their teacher - who had left the class for the test			2
scroll down for @entity25 : terrible : this little boy aims a real handgun left intentionally unattended at his face while the teacher was out of the room in @entity17 , @entity18 as part of a joint @entity34 and @entity7 study seven hidden cameras were placed around the classroom , while two unloaded , but real guns were placed inside toy boxes for the kids to find			1
@entity40 , the children 's parents who had agreed to the experiment and the @entity34 researchers who authored the study then watched how the kids reacted to the presence of the guns			1
the frightening response from two children showed them stare down the barrels and then wave the firearms around before shouting for help from an adult as they had been taught just days previously			2
to compound the shocking footage , the parents who agreed to let their children be secretly filmed all told @entity7 and the @entity34 researchers that they were confident their children would alert an adult immediately			1
not toys : this boy handles the gun like it is a toy after he begun rummaging around in a playbox at his school in @entity18 while filmed for the @entity7 experiment frightening : while the guns were not loaded - they were real - and the children waited minutes and played with them before calling for help from teachers at their school the fact they did not only served to highlight the unsettling study from the @entity77 which reported on the toll gun violence has had on child mortality rates in the @entity13			1
based on the most recently released data from 2009 , researchers discovered that over 7,000 children are hospitalized or killed due to gun violence and that an additional 3,00 children die from gun injuries before they even get to the hospital			1
more staggering statistics show that 1.7 million children live in a home with an unlocked and loaded firearm and that 1 child or teen is injured every hour by firearms in the @entity13			1
' this study reinforces what we know from the mortality data , ' @entity94 , the director of the @entity95 , told @entity100			0
' we have an extraordinary health burden in our youth associated with firearms injuries			2
' the data from 2009 reveals that 7,391 children under the age of 20 had been hospitalized from firearm injuries and 4,559 resulted from intentional uses of the @entity110 more @entity109 from @entity7 @entity111 hidden : the guns were placed in parts of the classroom the children would go to and were easily accesible scary : one of the guns is visible inside a toy - box from the classroom in @entity17 of that number , 2.149 were injured in accidents and 270 were suicide attempts and of the children who were hospitalized , 453 – 6 percent – died from their injuries			1
younger children - 20.8 percent of the number - were also more likely than 15 - to 19 - year - olds ( 8.3 % ) to suffer a traumatic brain injury			2
almost 90 percent of the cases were also more likely to be boys			0
racial disparity was also high , with 47 percent of the hospitalizations occurring in black children , with black kids 10 times more likely than white children to be a victim of guns			0
according to @entity139 little more than half of the injuries ( 52 percent ) involved open wounds , followed by fractures ( 50 percent ) , then chest , abdomen or pelvis internal injuries ( 32 percent )			2
sobering : this mother watches as her child waves around a gun inside the classroom while left unattended - she had volunteered her child because she thought they would be responsible around guns ' that ’s more than 7,000 children injured badly enough to be hospitalized , ' said the study ’s lead author , dr. @entity154 , a pediatrics professor at the @entity77			1
' all are unnecessary hospitalizations because preventing gun violence is something that can actually be done			0
' in an obvious suggestion , @entity159 said that to bring down this number , parents should keep their guns locked and hidden and separate from ammunition to keep their children safe			0
@entity94 also suggested to @entity100 that the government should make it illegal for individuals under 21 to own a firearm			0
' while you have to be 21 to purchase a handgun from a dealer , if you ’re an 18 - year - old you can go to a private seller and legally purchase a handgun in 38 out of 50 states , ' @entity94 said to @entity100			0
like buying groceries : shoppers at the @entity178 can buy weapons with ease parents looked to the sky in grief following the @entity185 massacre of december 2012 another damning statistic was that the mortality rate among children from firearms in the @entity13 was nearly 10 times higher than other wealthy nations			2
' this is a very unique and abnormal problem that such a wealthy nation should have such high mortality and morbidity in youth related to firearms , ' he said			0
gun control is high on the political agenda at the moment with the tragedy at @entity185 in december 2012 still raw			0
in the first 14 school days of 2014 , there have been at least 7 school shootings : at @entity204 in @entity205 , @entity206 in @entity207 , @entity208 in @entity209 , @entity210 in @entity211 , @entity212 in @entity213 , @entity214 in @entity213 , and most recently , @entity215 in @entity216			0
in 2013 , there were 28 school shootings .			0
