by @entity0 millions of @entity2 are misdiagnosed by doctors every year , and the mistakes have sometimes led to dire consequences , a new study has revealed			1
one in 20 , or 12million , people have been shown to receive the wrong diagnosis at outpatient facilities across the @entity2 these errors kill almost 100,000 people per year , according to a separate study			1
‘ the harm from misdiagnosis occurs when the correct treatment is delayed or when you get an inappropriate treatment or test , ’ @entity12 , author of the study published in @entity15 and @entity16 journal , told @entity17			1
seek a second opinion : a clean bill of health may not mean one is healthy ‘ what we say is , was there a missed opportunity ? was there some kind of a red flag ? ’ he said to @entity36			2
researchers analyzed the findings of three previous surveys that sought to quantify the results of diagnosis and follow up visits to come to their conclusion			0
one of the studies quantified the rates of misdiagnosis from primary care physicians , and the other two examined the rates of colorectal and lung cancer screenings and diagnoses , according to @entity53			1
‘ although it is unknown how many patients will be harmed from diagnostic errors , our previous work suggests that about one - half of diagnostic errors have the potential to lead to severe harm , ’ the study authors wrote			1
another survey cited by @entity12 ’s team found misdiagnosis rates to be as high as 10 per cent , but he explained to @entity17 that this is only further proof of the problem faced by @entity2 patients			1
a separate study found that about 98,000 people die each year from the wrong medical diagnosis			1
follow up : not hearing from the doctor does n't mean there is good news , always call for test results ‘ we ’ve had this problem for a while , ’ he told the site			0
‘ we just have n’t been able to measure it			0
’ @entity82 , 70 , was initially failed by her doctors when she had @entity85 colorectal cancer 12 years ago			0

@entity12 believes that both doctors and patients are to blame for the errors			2
some doctors may not be well - versed in the condition for which the patient is seeking treatment , but the patient may also not be able to effectively communicate their ailments , he argued in the study			2
paper records , instead of digital ones with full family medical histories , also hinder proper diagnoses , @entity12 told @entity17			1
following up with doctors is also recommended by @entity12 as a way to cut down potential life threatening errors .			2

about five per cent of all medical diagnoses in the @entity2 are *erroneous* , the study found
the errors kill as many as 98,000 people per year
