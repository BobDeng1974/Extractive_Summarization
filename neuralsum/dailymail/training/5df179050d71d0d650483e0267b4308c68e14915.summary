by @entity0 published : 16:51 est , 25 july 2012 updated : 16:47 est , 26 july 2012 time travel may still remain a sci - fi mystery , but one artist has skilfully turned a sparse modern - day room into a 19th century photograph - and captured the process on a time - lapse film			1
@entity8 , 32 , has become known for her photographic parodies where she creates modern interpretations of historical photos			1
in her latest work for an exhibition at the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity8 has transformed a young model into @entity18 by @entity20 photographers @entity21			2
the original photo of @entity18 ( right ) to create a time - lapse video capturing the 2012 to 1844 transformation , the @entity16 - born artist worked with filmmaker @entity31			1
set in an empty room with exposed brick , the three - minute clip shows the model drinking from a coffee cup , eating a banana and chatting as she is dressed in period clothing and slowly travels back to the 19th century			1
the set is a hive of activity as every detail is crucial to the success of the transformation			0
after some posing and a change of lighting , the model is then placed behind a false wall , complete with wallpaper and framed to actually become the photograph			2
the video will play in the same room as the original photograph at the exhibition which opens october 2012			2
art in the making : as part of an exhibition at the @entity15 , @entity8 and filmmaker @entity31 were commissioned to create a video depicting one of her interpretations of a 19th century photograph the model holds a cup of coffee before she is made over in period clothing in the three minute video , a model in an empty room of exposed brick transforms into @entity18 by @entity20 photographers @entity21 @entity8 graduated from the @entity76 in 2009 with an ma in @entity78 , having first completed a @entity79 in @entity80 at @entity81			1
on her university webpage she wrote : ' recently my work has explored and questioned how objects become valued ; be this through changing the context or material of a ‘ normal ’ domestic object , creating ‘ fake ’ photographic re-enactments of historic paintings , or creating illusory jewellery where the material worth is only seen from one photographic perspective			0
' humour within my work is important , so through my exploration of subject matter i ’m also aiming to create work that makes us smile			0
' ultimately i ’m striving to create work that is a balance of elegance and intelligence			0
' her first @entity105 solo show took place at @entity108 in november 2010			0
she has previously collaborated with her mother @entity109 on a project called taking the chair , in which the pair selected seven paintings by masters such as @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , in which a chair has a powerful presence			0
as the set develops lighting is added to ensure the final result mirrors that of a 19th century photo the model strikes a pose as she gets into character the time - lapse video shows the artist 's work slowly coming together the scene starts to take shape and go back in time as the final touches are added to the set the wallpaper is laid to give the effect that the photo is hanging on a wall the final result is a staggeringly realistic interpretation of the original photo			1
