by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 02:01 est , 24 august 2012 athletes with spinal cord injuries competing at the @entity4 may harm themselves deliberately in their quest for medals , experts have warned			1
some paralympians competing at the @entity8 in @entity9 are feared to have used ' boosting ' - a banned practice which involves hurting their lower bodies to raise their blood pressure and improve performance			1
competitors are known to have gone to extraordinary lengths in the past , including overfilling their bladder by fitting a catheter or even sticking pins into their testicles			2
the athletes do not feel the pain because they injure the paralysed areas of their bodies			0
fears : some paralympians are thought to have deliberately harmed themselves in an attempt to raise their blood pressure and improve performance the practice was banned by the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) in 2004 , but leading academic @entity32 believes as many as 30 per cent of competitors with spinal injuries may have cheated by doing it			1
dr @entity32 , an associate professor at the @entity36 , ' i will tell you right now as a physician people want to feel better , first of all - they feel better with their blood pressure higher			1
' but a second thing driving it is the desire to win , to have a fair playing field with other paralympic athletes who have higher blood pressure			1
' studies have found that athletes who use boosting can improve their performance by as much as 10 per cent			2
' as a physician i totally understand why these @entity51 are doing this , but as a scientist i am horrified with these events , ' dr @entity32 told the @entity55			0
checks : paralympics organisers test the blood pressure of athletes with spinal cord injuries before they compete @entity61 , the @entity31 's director of communications , told @entity62 : ' this is a practice which has been used by athletes with spinal cord injuries			1
' what a minority of these athletes tend to do is they try to induce pain below their spinal injury			0
boosting has been shown to improve a quadriplegic athlete 's performance by up to 10 per cent			2
but having raised blood pressure also puts the competitor at greater risk of a heart attack or stroke			1
by self - harming , cheating athletes are deliberately inducing a dangerous condition common to quadriplegics called autonomic dysreflexia			0
the condition can be set off naturally by many everyday activities that cause pain - even something seemingly minor , such as sunburn			0
it raises blood pressure to a level at which oxygen is transported to the muscles more quickly than before , giving athletes a significant edge over their competitors			1
however , symptoms also include intense headaches and it can lead to long - standing health problems			0
' that can include clamping their bladder , it can involve sticking pins in their testicles and sitting on sharp objects			0
' creating pain effectively increases their heart rate and , because the heart rate increases , the amount of oxygen getting to their muscles increases			0
' our research has shown that it can increase performance by as much as 10 per cent			0
' mr @entity61 said events where athletes who use boosting would have a clear advantage included athletics and handbiking			2
' we test the blood pressure of these athletes before they compete , ' he added			1
' if their blood pressure is not within the allowable rates we have , they will be asked to rest for 10 minutes and we will test them again			1
' if , when we test them again , their blood pressure is still high and they do not have a letter from a doctor explaining why it is high , we say to them " you ca n't compete on health grounds			1
" ' any person with high blood pressure who is competing can suffer a stroke or a heart attack			1
' mr @entity61 said 37 such checks were conducted at the @entity4 in 2008 and no athlete tested positive			0
a survey carried out by the @entity31 at @entity146 indicated that about 17 per cent of those who responded had used boosting			2
of the 60 participants who responded , 10 said they had			0
they were all male participants , with the majority competing in wheelchair rugby			0
problem : seventeen per cent of @entity4 athletes who responded to a survey in 2008 admitted that they had used boosting			2

quadriplegic competitors have hurt themselves to raise their blood pressure and enhance their chances
athletes have overfilled their bladders or even stuck pins into their testicles to gain advantage over rivals
' boosting ' practice was banned by the @entity31
but experts fear up to 30 per cent of competitors with spinal cord problems may have used it
