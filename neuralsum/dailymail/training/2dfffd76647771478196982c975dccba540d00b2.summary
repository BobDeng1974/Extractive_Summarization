by @entity0 last updated at 5:59 pm on 18th november 2011 @entity1 is not one to shy away from a challenge			2
it is a trait that has seen the businessman - turned - environmentalist rise from high school drop - out to multi-millionaire in a career that has been as diverse as it has been successful			0
now the 68 - year - old founder of outdoor clothing firm @entity10 and women 's fashion chain @entity11 looks as though he may close to realising another dream - his long - held and passionate attempts to create a vast nature reserve in @entity16			1
green aspirations : @entity10 and @entity11 founder @entity1 at his property in @entity19 , @entity16 , in 2009 where he wants to donate 370,000 acres of land to the government to create a new national park need for preservation : a group of caymans in @entity19 at the @entity26 , which is thought to be the second - largest wetland system in the world			1
it is , however , coming under increasing pressure from agriculture it is a quest that has provoked fierce criticism from the @entity36 country 's inhabitants , most notably that of @entity38 , who , three years ago , described him as a ' gringo imperialist ' after mr @entity1 had bought up huge amounts of land for conservation work			1
mr @entity45 even promised to expropriate his holdings over fears he was a threat to national sovereignty			0
but since the death of populist president @entity52 , there has been a warming of relations			0
this week , mr @entity1 announced his intention to donate 370,000 acres of his land on the @entity26 wetlands in the province of @entity59 , worth Â£ 120million , to the country in a bid to create a new national park			1
mixed use : the @entity26 lies in @entity16 's sub-tropical far north			2
it consists of some protected land , mr @entity1 's estates and areas largely privately owned for agriculture conserving nature : the wetlands are home to more than 4,000 different species , including capybaras ( pictured ) and anacondas			1
if the area became a national park , mr @entity1 's non-profit group would re-introduce several animals previously wiped out there it is hoped the park would protect the wetlands , the second - largest in the world , from farming and agriculture			1
mr @entity1 's non-profit group @entity87 ( @entity88 ) would also attempt to re-introduce species previously wiped out from the area			2
the 3.2million - acre reserve is afforded only limited protection as nearly half the area is divided into farms			0
the @entity10 brand was established in @entity95 in 1966 when @entity1 and @entity96 created an equipment retail store that went on to acquire the famous name			1
the name came about because the north face of a mountain in the northern hemisphere is usually the most challenging to climb			0
it began as a mail order and retail company and in the early years was a leader in the design of sleeping bags and tents			0
@entity1 and his partner designed the pioneering @entity10 tents which did away with the need for a pole in the middle by using bendable rods			1
@entity1 sold @entity10 in 1969 for $ 50,000 to focus on adventure film making and later to launch @entity11			1
the company logo ( pictured ) was designed by @entity118 in 1971 and consists of a quarter - circle with two lines running within it next to the name			0
continuing to thrive , the company hopes to double its turnover to $ 3billion over the next five years			0
however , the deal has to break through one last barrier - that of @entity127 governor @entity127 , who fiercely opposes the plan because he believes it would put the local farmers out of business			0
it was hoped mr @entity127 's administration might be persuaded to hand over the 1.36million acres it holds to the national government			2
but mr @entity1 and the current president , @entity136 will now wait and see if mr @entity127 's successor , set to replace him in 2013 , is more supportive			2
' it is a political issue , between the national and regional governments			0
it is not our responsibility , ' @entity88 spokeswoman @entity140 told @entity144			0
mr @entity1 was born in @entity145 in 1943 to an antiques dealer and decorator and raised in @entity148 , @entity149 , a summer resort for @entity151 's elite			2
after dropping out of high school , he moved to @entity153 where he attempted to make it onto the @entity156 ski team for the @entity157			1
around the same time , he set up the @entity158			0
he failed to be picked , so he decided to turn his hand to another talent - business and design			0
soon after , he founded @entity10 with @entity96 in @entity95 as a mail order and retail company specialising in rock climbing and camping equipment before selling it a few years later for $ 50,000			1
in 1968 , mr @entity1 then teamed up with @entity167 to create a dress - making company , selling clothes out of the back of a @entity172 bus			2
that company would become @entity11 , which by 1978 was enjoying sales in excess of $ 100million a year			0
green team : mr tompkins with his second and current wife , @entity178 , with whom he has helped to conserve more than two million acres of wilderness in @entity180 and @entity16 but by the 1980s , when @entity11 was flying even higher , mr @entity1 had a change of outlook , which he later explained , saying : ' @entity183 is one of the most intellectually vacuous industries			1
' we had to manufacture desires to get people to buy our products			0
we were selling people countless things that they did n't need			0
' fashion fix : mr @entity1 set up @entity11 with his first wife in 1968			1
they started out by selling clothes off the back of a bus he sold his share of the @entity36 company in 1989 back to @entity167 , from whom he had separated , and has since devoted his $ 150m fortune to buying up vast swathes of land in @entity180 and @entity16			1
mr @entity1 moved to south @entity180 , where he devoted much of his time to land conservation and environmental activism			1
he founded the @entity206 in 1990 , which supports environmental activism , and @entity87 in 1992 , which works to protect wildlands , primarily in @entity180 and @entity16			1
in 1993 , he married @entity209 ( nee @entity210 ) and the two have worked together on their conservation projects			2
they have spent about millions buying two dozen properties covering 2.2million acres in the two @entity36 countries			1
his land donations helped to establish the @entity216 and @entity217 in @entity180 , preventing loggers from cutting through the ancient woodland			0
but he has not been without his critics as many locals began to speculate about this @entity36 's motives			1
some claims were outlandish , such as him wanting to create a nuclear dumping ground , while others speculated that he wanted to seize control of water supplies			0
@entity228 , a conservative senator for southern @entity180 once said : ' if i were to go to the @entity156 and buy a big area of @entity231 as an environmental preserve and tell people they ca n't go here or there , i think the @entity156 would kick me right out of there			2
' @entity237 , the regional newspaper in @entity127 , once described mr @entity1 's projects as ' tentacles ' wrapping around @entity26			2
you will have to what this space to see if mr @entity1 's latest venture is a manageable ascent or a cliff face that 's just too steep to climb .			0

@entity1 wants to donate 370,000 acres of land to create national park in @entity16
he founded @entity10 and women 's fashion chain @entity11 after failing to *qualify* for @entity156 ski team for 1964 @entity254
but turned to environmental ventures after growing tired of ' vacuous industries '
has spent millions on conservation projects in @entity36 , but locals have been *skeptical* of his motives
