on a day of drama at the @entity2 hosted by @entity3 , it was @entity4 who wrote his name into the record books , thanks to an emphatic third win of the 2014 @entity11 season			1
the @entity12 finished five clear of compatriot @entity14 on 12 under par thanks to a three under closing 69 on saturday , a feat which ensured he became the first player in @entity11 history to win three titles in one season on two separate occasions			1
few could question the serene way in which @entity4 went about his business on the final day , as he built an unassailable lead thanks to five birdies and just two dropped shots , meaning attention soon turned to the battle for a place in an increasingly fluid top 15 on the @entity30			1
@entity4 ( centre ) is congratulated by his fellow players after his third @entity11 win of the season @entity35 ( above ) secured his place as @entity11 number one , earning his @entity39 card the @entity11 's closing event of the season was held at the picturesque @entity43 golf club in @entity44 while @entity35 rubber - stamped his title as the 2014 @entity11 @entity47 with a top ten finish after a level par final round of 72 , it was all happening further down the list as dreams were made and hearts were broken			1
for much of the day it had looked like @entity55 had done enough to earn his place amongst the graduating class , but five dropped shots in as many holes around the turn put paid to his chances and left the way clear for the charging @entity14 , who hit light speed on the final day in @entity44			1
the @entity12 started the week with a six over par 78 in the opening round , but a fantastic run over the closing three rounds culminated in a final round 69 , which meant he climbed 25 places in the @entity30 to 13th place			2
it was not all plain sailing for the 29 year old though , thanks to a bogey at the 17th which had seen him drop out of the reckoning for promotion , but a birdie at the last saw him vault back in			2
he would have to wait anxiously by as @entity78 played the last , but when the @entity80 hit his tee shot in the water , @entity14 's graduation was all but secure			2
as for his compatriot @entity4 , he was just pleased to sign off the season in such a positive manner , as he prepares for a second crack at the big time next year			1
@entity78 ( centre ) of @entity89 finished third in the tournament , also earning his @entity39 playing rights as @entity92 drew to a close for 2014 in @entity44 , here are the top 15 players who have earned a playing card and promotion to the illustrious @entity39 : 1st : @entity35 ( @entity98 ) 2nd : @entity4 ( @entity12 ) 3rd : @entity99 ( @entity100 ) 4th : @entity101 ( @entity102 ) 5th : @entity103 ( @entity104 ) 6th : @entity105 ( @entity98 ) 7th : @entity106 ( @entity107 ) 8th : @entity108 ( @entity98 ) 9th : @entity109 ( @entity12 ) 10th : @entity78 ( @entity89 ) 11th : @entity110 ( @entity12 ) 12th : @entity111 ( @entity102 ) 13th : @entity112 ( @entity12 ) 14th : @entity113 ( @entity114 ) 15th : @entity115 ( @entity98 ) ' it is a perfect end to the season for sure , ' said the 27 year old			1
' i played very well the last three months , but this is a great feeling			2
i always practice hard and keep myself positive in the bad times , but now everything is ok , and we will have a lot of fun over the next week before i start practicing to improve my game for @entity126			2
' my game is much better than the last time i graduated , but sometimes i still feel so - so on the course , and i have a few bad stretches which i want to fix			2
if i can sort that out then i feel i can perform well next season			2
' it was a hard day , with the wind getting up at the end of the round , but i stayed focused with my caddie and played it shot - by - shot			1
i had some good birdies on the 14th and 15th which gave me a good advantage , and over the last two holes i was just patient up until the end			0
' my goal will be to keep my card next year			0
i have won six times on the @entity11 , but now i want to win on @entity126			0
winning three times in two different seasons has never been done before , which is a great achievement , but i would exchange all of those for one win on @entity126			0
' i 'm going to keep it the same for next year , stay focused and play my game , and we 'll see what happens			0
i had a good winter last year , and i want the same this time around , so if i can do that then it will be ok for next year			0
' @entity158 ( centre ) of @entity160 finished fifth in @entity44 , but it was not enough to earn a @entity39 card @entity163 ( centre ) on his way to finishing fourth in the tournament and fifth in the overall rankings @entity14 may sound like a fictional villain from a @entity170 movie , but the man with one of the best names in golf proved he is more than just an impressive moniker			1
his form over the final 54 holes was nothing short of miraculous , and in every way deserving of a starting berth in @entity180 to @entity44 for 2015			1
' it has n't sunk in yet , but it is the first time in my career i am happy to be second , ' said the @entity184 resident			0
' on the 18th , watching ( @entity78 ) @entity78 was the longest time of my life , and really , i do n't know what to say as i ca n't quite believe it			0
maybe when i put my tee in the ground on the first hole on @entity126 , then i will believe it			0
' it feels great , but we 'll see how it goes next year			0
i 'm so excited to get out there as soon as i can , and i ca n't wait to get home and rest with my family and friends and stop golf for a while			0
for the moment i do n't care about the schedule for next year , i just want to rest			0
' @entity78 might not have realised the effect his play on the final hole would have had on so many players ' careers , but regardless of his crucial bogey at the last to card a closing 73 and finish six adrift of @entity4 , the @entity80 will be elated with a third place finish that guarantees a maiden sojourn on @entity126 at the end of an impressive rookie season			1
in fourth was the ever - consistent @entity99 ( 68 ) who has long been assured of a place on @entity180 to @entity44 in 2015 , while @entity214 ( 70 ) and @entity158 ( 71 ) rounded out the top five			1
the players who earned their @entity39 playing rights for 2015 celebrate at the end of the tournament in the @entity30 , @entity220 was the unfortunate one to miss out in the dreaded 16th spot on the season - long list , after he fell to a 78 on saturday			1
@entity223 ( 72 ) had briefly climbed into the top 15 at the end of his round after @entity14 's bogey at the penultimate hole , but the @entity12 's crucial four at the last knocked the @entity98 back down to 17th			0
there was also disappointment for @entity55 ( 77 ) , who had entered the final day inside the top 15 on the provisional list , but eventually missed out			0
as for top spot , @entity35 always looked like he had it under control having entered the week with a substantial lead , and his tie for ninth at the end of 72 holes in @entity44 ensured a return to @entity126 in 2015 thanks to earnings of â‚¬ 190,856 this season , the highest winning total since @entity245 in 2009 .			1

@entity4 closes with a three - under 69 for emphatic five - shot *victory*
@entity35 finished ninth , securing position atop the season rankings
@entity35 and 14 others ensured rise to 2015 @entity39 in @entity44
