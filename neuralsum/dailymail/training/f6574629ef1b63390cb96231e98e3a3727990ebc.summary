@entity2 taxpayers are forking out almost £ 1million a year for pregnant @entity4 women to go home and give birth in their native country , it emerged yesterday			1
under @entity10 rules , set up to provide emergency healthcare between member states , hundreds of @entity4 women are returning to their families to have their children , with the @entity15 picking up the bill			2
last year around 500 @entity4 living in the @entity2 went back to their native land to give birth			1
@entity2 picks up the bill for healthcare in other @entity21 states when patients have arranged treatment with an @entity25 form ( file photo ) patients who pay tax and live in the @entity2 can go to another @entity21 country or @entity30 for treatment paid for by the @entity15 ( file photo ) given that the average cost to the @entity15 per birth is £ 1,631 , @entity4 births alone cost the @entity2 taxpayer around £ 850,000 in 2012			1
the situation has become more acute following the influx of immigrants into the @entity2 from @entity40 over the past decade			2
under @entity10 regulations , anyone who comes to @entity2 to earn a living can fill in an @entity45 or @entity25 form , which entitles them to free treatment in any other member state or @entity30			1
the same applies to @entity2 women living in a @entity51 state			2
latest figures reveal that there were 1,132 cases last year where @entity2 paid for treatment in @entity21 countries or @entity30			1
some 995 cases , or around 90 per cent , related to maternity care			1
of these , 519 were for treatment in @entity4 hospitals , with 174 cases in @entity63 and 90 in @entity64			1
there were 74 cases in @entity67 , 49 in the @entity68 and 21 in @entity69			0
@entity71 hospitals claimed for 18 , @entity72 for 12 , four from @entity73 and one claim from @entity75			0
the figures are more than double that of 2010 when just 442 of the 1,498 cases related to maternity care			1
@entity80 @entity83 the @entity82 @entity81 the @entity2 @entity84 , @entity85 spokesman on home affairs , said : ‘ this is yet another example of how membership of the @entity10 means the @entity2 public purse is being plundered			2
people fleece us for whatever they can get			0
unfortunately all these things are totally legal			0
we can only put a stop to it by leaving the @entity10			0
’ to obtain an @entity25 form , an @entity15 consultant must first agree that treatment abroad is right for the patient			1
the patient must also gain approval from the local health authority and the @entity102			0
patients are treated under the same care conditions as residents of the country they go to			0
in nations where state healthcare is not free , the patient may have to pay a percentage of the cost			2
@entity113 mp @entity112 said : ‘ when this scheme was set up it was meant to cover for emergency treatment			0
‘ this particular @entity10 area should be renegotiated when the prime minister sets out a repatriation of powers			0
’ a @entity102 spokesman said : ‘ under @entity10 rules , anyone working and paying tax where they are living , including @entity2 living abroad , can request treatment in another @entity10 country			1
‘ this is particularly common in maternity cases where some people prefer to be around family and friends			0

@entity2 spent £ *2million* last year on treatment in other @entity21 countries
90 per cent of the 1,132 cases paid for by @entity15 were for maternity care
there were 519 cases in @entity4 last year , 174 in @entity63 and 90 in @entity64
@entity25 form means @entity15 pays for those who pay tax in @entity2 to go abroad
we would like to make clear that the cost of £ 1m has been calculated on the *assumption* that the cost billed to the @entity15 of a birth in @entity4 under the @entity25 / @entity45 scheme is the same or *similar* to the average cost of a birth in the @entity2 which is £ 1,631
