by @entity0 for @entity1 a fire alarm test gone awry left a fleet of @entity5 military choppers buried in fire suppression foam at an @entity8 base tuesday			1
an outside contractor at the @entity11 base was testing the safety system when the foam was accidentally triggered			2
the result was a hangar brimming with the frothy white chemical and and ten high tech helicopters looking like a freak summer snow storm had blown through @entity19			1
buried : a fleet of military @entity5 helicopters was buried in foam tuesday morning when someone accidentally set off a fire suppression system foamy : ten of the choppers in total were buried at the @entity29 base in @entity19 blizzard : some cyclonic winds even caused a brief ' foam devil ' pilot @entity33 told @entity34 9 that , at least for most of the affected helicopters , the foam acted mostly like a bath for the aircraft			1
seven of them were outside the hangar , where pictures show foam had poured from inside where the system was triggered			0
those @entity45 , however , had their cockpits closed and were completely untouched save for their sturdy exteriors			0
inside , however , three more choppers were parked with their doors ajar			0
officials told @entity34 9 that those did require some maintenance			0
in spite of initial fears that the aircraft would be out of commission for weeks , officials said they were all back in working order by tuesday afternoon			1
all set to fly : mechanics feared the three @entity45 that were inside the hangar would be inoperable for weeks , but a check soon revealed they were good to go by tuesday evening like a bath : the helicopters parked outside the hangar were completely undamaged			2

ten black hawk helicopters were buried tuesday morning at the @entity19 , @entity68 base
at one point , cyclonic winds *created* a foam *-* devil on the base
officials say none of the aircraft were damaged
