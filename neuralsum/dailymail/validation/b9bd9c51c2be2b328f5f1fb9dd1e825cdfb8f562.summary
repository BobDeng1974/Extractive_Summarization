@entity0 is not short of a marvellous beach or two			2
it is , after all , a country with 2,000 miles of coastline			2
there 's @entity6 , of course , on the island of @entity9 , as featured in the 2000 film based on the @entity12 novel and starring @entity13			1
and there 's the small sandy cove on @entity16 in uber - picturesque @entity17			1
the @entity18 is one of the oldest rainforests in the world , where you can meet elephants at one of the better camps the island is now known as @entity16 , upon which you and a chum can pose back to back with imaginary weapons , echoing the scene from @entity30 of 007 ( @entity31 ) and the evil @entity32 ( @entity33 )			1
but the problem is practically every other visitor who chooses @entity0 for their exotic sun , sea and sand holiday wants to sit and be seen in the country 's most famous hotspots too			0
it gets a little crowded , to say the least			0
at the risk of sounding a bit of a beach snob , i want to be alone , or at least not swamped by hundreds of other sunbathers , when i 'm on my holiday , at least until i 've shaken off some stress			0
if you do too , you 'll adore the @entity51			1
and thanks to direct flights to @entity54 aboard @entity56 's @entity55 , you do n't have to faff around catching a connecting flight from @entity58			1
it 's a real bonus			0
if you have flown long haul before , you will notice the difference - more space , both seat-wise and all around , dimmable windows , more oxygen and better lighting all make the journey more bearable			1
and it 's only an hour or so drive north from the airport to @entity51 , or 90 minutes away from the busy and , er , colourful attractions of tourist trap @entity70			1
the @entity72 is very classy and quiet and has a glorious beach whch is free from crowds i 'll be honest , i was n't expecting such a tasteful resort			1
@entity79 oriental in design , the @entity77 is very classy and quiet , with 250 rooms and all the facilities you need for a proper rest and de-stress , whether there 's just two of you or the whole family			1
there 's a nice spa , @entity90 , offering all the usual pamperings and treatments			0
the range of dining options includes breakfast and international cuisine in the @entity98 restaurant , @entity0 food at @entity100 , @entity101 at @entity102 , and @entity103 at @entity104			0
there 's a deli , too , and numerous bars and lounges			0
it 's easy not to step outside for the whole holiday , but i was persuaded to do a little sightseeing			0
a trip to @entity16 also included a look at a small rubber plantation , feeding monkeys beside a @entity117 temple , cruising through mangrove swamps in a long - tailed boat , and lunch in the @entity122 village at @entity123			1
it 's all well run and very commercialised			0
@entity125 ( right ) and @entity33 on @entity127 island in the film @entity30 more off the beaten track is @entity18 , one of the oldest rainforests in the world , where you can meet elephants at one of the better camps			1
however , do be very careful to choose a well - run establishment when selecting this kind of adventure			1
we were taken by canoe - you do n't even have to lift an oar yourself - down the @entity143 , admiring the trees and waterfalls as we went			2
and , of course , there are dozens of snorkelling and diving sites to choose from			0
the @entity72 itself offers numerous sports on site , a fitness centre , and there 's golf galore nearby			2
@entity9 featured in the 2000 film based on the @entity12 novel and starring @entity13 naturally , it has plenty of places to sunbathe or take a dip , not least @entity163 , a marvellously empty stretch of white sand fringing the @entity162			0
the resort also claims to have @entity168 's longest swimming pool - indeed , it winds around and in between the buildings like a huge lazy river , allowing some rooms to actually be swim - up , which is great for families			2
the best bit for me , though , was the very private hidey - holes complete with loungers , cleverly sheltered with hedges , but still with easy access to the water			2
getting there @entity56 ( thomson.co.uk , 0871 230 2555 ) offers seven nights @entity182 at the @entity183 from Â£ 934pp , including return flights from @entity185 departing april 10 , and transfers .			0

@entity51 is an hour drive away from the airport at @entity54
oriental in design , the @entity77 is classy and quiet
nearby @entity18 is one of the oldest rainforests in the world
