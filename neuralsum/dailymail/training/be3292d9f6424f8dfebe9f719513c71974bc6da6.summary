even now , three years on , @entity0 struggles to comprehend his dramatic demise as @entity3 manager and the controversial events that preceded his resignation			1
he has regrets , but also a lingering sense of defiance			2
the 44 - year - old @entity10 - winning captain kept the lowest of profiles since his fall from grace following @entity3 ’s scandal - ridden failure in 2011			1
but now he has spoken for the first time about the events that led to the end of his tenure			0
‘ looking back at it , of course i would have done things differently , ’ he said			0
‘ we can all do that			0
you do what you think is right at the time , that ’s all you can do			0
we could all say we ’d go back and change things			0
@entity0 looks on during an @entity30 training session in @entity31 @entity3 's poor campaign in @entity31 was blighted by off - the - field problems @entity34 and other @entity10 stars went to a ' dwarf - throwing ' event during a night out in @entity37 @entity38 was fined for jumping off a ferry into the water in @entity41 @entity3 players @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity34 party at @entity46 , @entity47 september 11 : @entity43 , @entity34 , @entity48 and @entity44 reportedly take part in a ' dwarf - throwing ' contest in a bar in @entity37			1
september 13 : @entity52 is handed a two - game ban for ' recklessly striking ' @entity55 's @entity54 with his knee			1
@entity0 defends allowing his players to go bungee jumping on their day off			1
september 29 : kicking coach @entity59 and fitness specialist @entity60 are suspended after being found to have switched the ball @entity62 was due to kick against @entity63 with without asking the permission of referee			0
october 2 : @entity0 reprimands three players for making inappropriate comments to a female hotel worker			1
october 9 : @entity38 is formally warned by police and fined £ 3,000 by @entity3 rugby officials after jumping from a ferry in @entity41			1
‘ we got caught out off the field			2
we were aware of what could happen and warned the players , but it still happened			2
we warned the players about it and you think you ’ve covered it , when maybe you have n’t covered it			2
maybe you have to say it every day			2
‘ the difficult thing is that it gets perceived as something that it was n’t really			0
i ’m not saying that things did n’t happen , but i ’m saying the perception is that that was the only thing that happened			0
that became the story rather than the rugby , and that ’s what gets remembered			0
‘ in 2003 , once you ’ve won the @entity10 , everything is portrayed as being great and a perfect working machine			2
but of course it was n’t ; we were all human beings , we all made mistakes , had our frailties and did similar things that the boys did in 2011			1
it just did n’t get to that level and did n’t get recorded			0
and then you win , so everything is all right			0
’ what is clear is that the episodes in @entity31 which left him in an untenable position have left deep scars			0
on his watch , in the midst of a high - profile event , @entity3 ’s reputation was tarnished by unseemly episodes off the field — primarily the infamous dwarf - tossing night out in @entity37 after an opening pool - stage victory against @entity55			1
caught in the eye of a storm , @entity0 made the mistake of playing down the matter , with his notorious ‘ rugby player drinks beer , shock ’ remark			1
@entity0 has broken his silence after @entity3 's disappointing @entity10 in 2011 @entity0 has defended his team but admitted : ' we all make mistakes ' having stubbornly refused to strike a remorseful tone , @entity0 ’s position was further undermined as @entity3 blundered from one crisis to another ; from inappropriate behaviour towards hotel staff , to illicit match - ball swapping , to @entity38 ’s dive off a ferry into @entity41 harbour			1
by the end of that @entity10 , as his side were dispatched by @entity138 in the quarter - finals , the manager cut a shattered and forlorn figure			2
his resignation followed , as did the knife - twist of leaked reports which provided a damning postscript — with players criticising many aspects of the @entity3 regime			1
though the dust has long since settled and the national team has been revitalised on the back of @entity153 ’s overhaul of personnel and culture , @entity0 still believes he and his regime were , in part , victims of what he considers to be false perception			1
‘ it was n’t actually a true reflection of those people and what we were about , ’ he said ‘ but you ’re fighting a tidal wave almost at that point because everyone “ knows ” what ’s happened because they ’ve read about it			0
‘ people start telling me what it was like when i was there — that ’s the battle you have to win			0
that was my mistake ; you have to win that battle as well			0
it ’s almost like a sales job			0
’ @entity3 players watch on during a quarter - final defeat by @entity138 in @entity41 @entity186 and @entity187 battle for the ball in a pool b match @entity38 was caught up in off - the - field controversy during the competition @entity0 and captain @entity193 chat during a training session in @entity195 during his tenure as @entity3 manager , @entity0 presided over a record of 21 wins , 16 defeats and a draw in 38 tests			1
yet , for all the criticism which came his way at the end , he was at pains to emphasise the fact that he presided over the country ’s only @entity209 title success since 2003 , along with the introduction of several players who have become stalwarts of the @entity215 regime			1
‘ people go , “ it was a disaster at the @entity10 ” , but @entity3 have won one championship in the last 11 years and that was in 2011 , ’ he said			1
‘ we won 10 out of 13 games that year and we did ok			0
‘ ultimately , we brought through a lot of players who had a successful start to their career , although we were criticised for not doing that			2
‘ @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity52 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity34 , @entity229 and @entity38 all came through			1
in 2008 - 09 there was a lack of guys who were really putting their hands up to play @entity234 rugby			2
we did start bringing some through and they played well			0
’ his words suggest that the subject of his legacy is another scar — another perception issue			0
while @entity153 implemented a revamp of the @entity3 with an influx of youth , @entity0 makes plain that he had laid some of the ground - work			1
he has stayed quiet for so long , but now he has stuck his head back above the parapet , to try to set the record straight			0
@entity0 is a @entity250 ambassador for the @entity251 @entity0 is a @entity252 2015 ambassador			1
the @entity10 2015 ticket ballot is now open , use your @entity252 when buying tickets and you wo n't pay any surcharges and you 'll be in with a chance of @entity258 - @entity259			2
