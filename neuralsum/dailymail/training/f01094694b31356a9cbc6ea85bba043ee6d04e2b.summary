passengers on a new flight planned between @entity2 and @entity3 will barely have time to open the inflight magazine and order hot drink between take - off and landing			1
@entity9 , a low - cost @entity10 airline , has announced plans for what it claims is the world ’s shortest international flight – a 30 - mile trip between the @entity10 and @entity18 capitals			1
but baring in mind that the journey takes just an hour by car and even less by train - one wonders if it 's worth the hassle of faffing around in immigration and check - in			1
@entity9 will launch their snappy ' ten minute ' flight between @entity2 and @entity3 in april this year it 's also a fifteen minute drive to the airport from central @entity3 and 20 minutes from @entity2 , so a bus ride might even be quicker , and it would certainly be cheaper			1
perhaps aptly , the route , which will cover around 30 miles , launches on april 1 , and while it 's likely to be on the radar of many aviation enthusiasts , it 's unlikely to be an appealing option for most regular travellers			2
there is a fifteen minute drive to the airport from central @entity3 , making the short flight less appealing the 30 - mile trip between the @entity10 and @entity18 capitals takes around an hour by car and less by train @entity45 to @entity46 on @entity47 , 16 hours and 55 minutes			1

@entity70 to @entity71 on @entity72 , 45 minutes in total			0
bosses at the airline admit it will be primarily useful for those with connecting flights from @entity2			1
the world 's shortest flight is currently the mile - long journey from @entity82 to @entity83 in @entity85 's @entity84 , which can take as few as 47 seconds , depending on wind direction			2
a bidding war over the route was settled in 2013 , with the contract being awarded to @entity85 airline @entity59 , its current operator			2
meanwhile , the record for longest flight goes to @entity47 ' 17 - hour , 8,500 - mile schlep from @entity46 to @entity45 .			1

low - cost *carrier* @entity9 to *introduce* new 30 - mile flight in april this year
the *intercontinental* journey takes just an hour by car or even less by train
