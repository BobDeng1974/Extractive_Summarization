the @entity1 claims to spend 90 per cent of its income on conservation work			1
but the landowners – led by former cricketer and keen shot sir @entity0 – said the charity was more interested in political lobbying than protecting wildlife			1
yesterday they reported the @entity1 to the @entity17 , claiming the organisation , which received £ 122million in grants , donations and commercial income last year , spent just £ 30million ( 24 per cent ) on its bird reserves			1
sir @entity0 , who runs a commercial shoot at his home in @entity26 and is one of the leaders of the you forgot the birds campaign , said : ‘ it is a massive bureaucracy where donations are spent on homes for office workers not homes for birds			1
' birds do n’t need hundreds of campaigners and lobbyists in suits – they need people with spades building habitat			2
’ @entity43 , the campaign ’s director , said : ‘ the @entity1 seems to be more interested in political lobbying than conservation , which they seem to think is a bit boring			1
’ @entity1 spokesman @entity49 said last night that managing nature reserves was only a tiny part of the charity ’s conservation programme and that other activities , such as research and advising farmers , were also important			2
the @entity1 claims to spend 90 per cent of its income on conservation work a total of £ 69million is spent on conservation , a further £ 19million on education and political lobbying , and £ 32million on fundraising , he claimed			1

they can pose so beautifully , stretching out their wings			2
but as many a frustrated photographer will tell you , birds usually disappear the second you lift up the camera			0
but with a lot of patience and a heap of tempting mealworms , one enthusiast has earned the trust of the birds in his garden to the point that he has them eating out of his hand , allowing him to picture them closer than ever before			0
great tit @entity100 : this diligent photographer from @entity103 , @entity104 - known only as @entity105 - has befriended the birds in his garden to the point that they are literally eating out of his hand the 49 - year - old father of two , known only as @entity105 , even has names for his feathered friends : deirdre the blue tit , great tit @entity100 , a brown sparrow called @entity114 and @entity115 the robin			0
the photographer , from @entity103 , @entity104 , said : ‘ it ’s all down to the power of the mealworm			0
it ’s a joy but you have to be patient			0
' their instinct is to fly away so it ’s really special when they trust you enough to stay			0
now they follow me and sit on the fence next to me			0
