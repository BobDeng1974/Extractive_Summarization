@entity0 and @entity1 made their first official outing as a couple last week at a party for his best friend @entity6 @entity7 has a face that you might well recognise , but probably ca n't work out why			1
since 2001 , the eternally youthful football agent has been a permanent fixture in the background of celebrity photos - head down as the paparazzi jostle for pictures of his famous friends			1
but despite his low - key public persona , the 38 - year - old has had a central position in two of @entity22 's most important social circles for more than a decade ; he is @entity6 's best friend and also a key member of @entity26 's @entity25 posse			1
and now , @entity0 has managed to bag one of @entity29 's brightest beauties , the actress @entity1 , and the couple are expecting a child together			1
so who is this man and how did he become one of @entity22 's most - connected men ? it all started at the tender age of 14 , when @entity0 joined the @entity38 youth team			0
even though the signing lasted for just five years , it was to eave a permanent impact on both his professional and love lives			0
it was at @entity38 that @entity0 became close friends with @entity45 and also a young @entity6			1
@entity7 and @entity6 were both promising sportsmen who spent every evening on the football pitch and quickly became best friends			1
but while @entity6 went on to join @entity45 as one of the best players of his generation , @entity7 struggled to keep up and left the club in his late teens			0
his time spent at the club was n't wasted though - soon after he left , @entity0 set up the @entity56 with six @entity58 's son @entity57 , the pair 's contacts meant they soon became two of the biggest football agents in the @entity63			1
after a few years , @entity0 decided to start up his own company , which is still going strong today			0
despite the pair no longer training together , @entity7 's friendship with @entity6 has stayed the test of time and he is one of two old friends the superstar credits with keeping his feet on the ground			2
he is @entity6 's eldest son @entity74 's godfather and just last week he and @entity1 attended a party in the @entity78 captain 's honour in @entity22			1
it was his friendship with @entity45 that formed much of his personal life for the last decade though			0
@entity7 pictured with a @entity6 and @entity88 at the launch of @entity6 's @entity91 whiskey in @entity0 's early twenties , @entity45 was dating his sister @entity93 , who he then dumped for the @entity95 actress @entity94			1
at the time , @entity0 was in a long - relationship with model @entity97 and the couple were a permanent fixture on @entity102 's social scene			2
but the relationship came to an abrupt end after @entity97 left him for @entity45 - the couple are still together to this day , despite revelations in recent years of @entity45 's infidelity			0
a heartbroken @entity0 and @entity94 - who is also heiress to a multi-million pound loo roll empire - took solace in each other 's company and it ended up being a match well - made as the pair eventually married in 2003			1
@entity7 with his ex-wife @entity94 - the couple married in 2003 but divorced in 2010 @entity6 was best man at the £ 875,000 wedding , while @entity117 singer @entity116 was a bridesmaid			1
for the next few years , the couple were key components of the famous @entity120 set - a group of well - known @entity123 stars including @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 that centered around @entity26			2
in 2007 , @entity94 gave birth to their child - a son called @entity134 - and @entity26 and @entity6 were named the godparents			1
for a while , it seemed that the couple had it all , @entity0 lavished expensive gifts on his wife and the pair regularly took groups of friends on holiday to @entity94 's father 's yacht in the @entity147			1
@entity0 with @entity148 at a magazine party last year ( left ) and with celebrity friends @entity151 and @entity152 but gradually , @entity94 's troubles with alcohol and bipolar disorder proved too difficult and cracks started to appear in the relationship - according to reports , he was often left at home looking after the child			1
the pair divorced in 2010 , with @entity0 citing @entity163 ’s ‘ unreasonable behaviour ’ as the grounds for the split and he gained custody of their three - year - old son			0
the couple sold their home @entity172 for £ 3 million to the comedian @entity173			0
for a while @entity0 made very few appearances on the showbiz circuit and was hesitant to return to the dating scene			0
a short - lived romance with @entity178 , who was the ex-wife of the heir to the @entity181 's soup business , reportedly ended because he felt she was too flash with her cash			0
then in early 2013 , @entity0 hit the headlines again after it was revealed that he was enjoying a relationship with the popstar @entity186 , who was 15 years his junior			2
@entity7 with ex-girlfriend @entity186 and @entity188 at a party in february 2013 the pair were spotted on numerous dates and @entity186 was pictured doing the ' walk of shame ' early one morning from his @entity22 home in the same outfit she had worn the night before			2
but the relationship was once again just a brief spell and @entity186 moved on to her now ex-boyfriend @entity197 , while @entity0 allegedly enjoyed a short dalliance with @entity199			2
it was only in mid-july of this year that rumours first arose of his romance with @entity1 - the @entity29 actress and daughter of @entity207 's @entity206			2
@entity1 is no stranger to the @entity208 - her previous husband and father of her first child is @entity213 - born @entity212 from the band @entity214			0
it has been reported that @entity26 conspired to set the pair up after becoming convinced they would hit it off			0
@entity7 and @entity26 - the supermodel introduced him to his girlfriend @entity1 the supermodel was right - they have now been together for several months and recently joined the supermodel and her husband @entity151 on a holiday to @entity227			2
