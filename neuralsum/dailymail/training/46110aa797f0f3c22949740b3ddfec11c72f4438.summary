by @entity0 published : 11:11 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 13:11 est , 4 september 2013 many people have likely dreamed of walking out of an awful job and giving their boss a piece of their mind in the process			2
now three employees of a clothes store have walked out at once - and publicly shared their thoughts on their boss , ' @entity10 ' , for all to see			1
@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 left no one to man the @entity16 clothes and shoe shop in @entity19 's @entity18 , @entity20 , when they made the pact to leave			1
walking out : the entire staff at @entity23 , @entity19 , @entity20 decided enough was enough and walked out , locked up and left a public letter explaining exactly what they thought of their boss , ' @entity10 ' so they closed the shop front and stuck up a big letter for their boss ' @entity10 ' on the security railings explaining exactly why they had left			1
they start by apparently quoting the boss , who they claim said ' cancer is not an excuse ' and go on to explain that he swears at the staff ' all the time '			2
@entity10 since you decided to say ' cancer is not an excuse ' and think it 's ok to swear at your employees like you do all the time ... we quit			1
this is why you ca n't keep a store manager longer than a year			2
you abuse your roll ( sic ) and staff			2
enjoy the fact that you lost a store manager , co-manager , and key holder in the middle of @entity56			0
think next time you treat people the way you do			0
we are n't allowing it any more			0
@entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 ' this is why you ca n't keep a store manager for more than a year , ' they write			1
the ex-employees claim @entity10 abuses his position in his superior role and is abusive to staff , and for all of these reasons he has now lost a store manager , co-manager and key - holder , they point out			1
and it 's also a peak time for the shop since it 's the busy back - to - school period			1
' think next time you treat people the way you do			0
we are n't allowing it any more , ' the former workers sign off			0
picked up by @entity83 , the news service also points out that the icing on the cake in this story of justice is that shops are fined $ 500 for each day of unannounced closure			0
it is not known however , if this journeys store was fined or not			0
a member of staff at @entity16 , in @entity19 's @entity94 told the @entity95 the store was open today but said she was unable to comment on the employees ' resignations			0
no one at the clothing and shoe company 's media team was immediately available for comment			0
the staff walked out of the @entity105 of @entity16 clothes and shoe shop			1

@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 had *reached* their limit with their ' abusive ' boss ' @entity10 '
during peak ' back to school ' *season* , they walked out and closed up
they stuck their joint resignation letter on the shop front explaining exactly what they thought of their boss and *advised* him to *change* his attitude
