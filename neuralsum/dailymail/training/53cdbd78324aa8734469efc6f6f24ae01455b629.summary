by @entity0 published : 18:56 est , 26 october 2013 updated : 07:56 est , 27 october 2013 a suburban @entity3 town is outraged after learning a serial rapist is moving in - and they are n't going down without a fight			0
@entity7 , 62 , dubbed the ‘ @entity15 ’ after being linked to dozens of sexual assaults on women during the 1970s and 80s , has been cleared to move to a @entity11 home close to a park , multiple schools and a bus stop			1
the depraved man has admitted to 41 rapes , but said there were about 70 unreported , according @entity19 @entity3			1
he is being released into the area because he previously resided in @entity3 , officials said			2
a very sick man : @entity7 admitted to raping 38 women , but said about 70 other rapes went unreported announced earlier this week during a hearing in @entity28 , the conditions of mr @entity7 ’s release are sealed – people living on the street he is targeted to live on by the end of this year are not happy			1
‘ i have a daughter , so this is n't going to work for me , ’ @entity32 told @entity33			2
also seen in a @entity19 @entity3 report , mr @entity32 stood in front of the house and pointed about 100 feet down the street to a school bus stop			1
‘ that ’s where children get off , ’ he angrily shouted			0
the home is within a few miles of two schools and only 2,200 feet from a nearby park – just outside the limits of @entity47 , which prohibits predators from living closer than 2,000 feet to any park or school			1
home sweet home : this is the @entity11 home officials have decided will house the serial rapist ‘ the bus stop is right in front of my house , with all the kids , ’ @entity58 told @entity19 @entity3 , ‘ i do n’t know what the heck ’s going on with that			1
’ @entity63 , 19 , pointed to three houses where children live , telling @entity19 @entity3 that ‘ a lot of children live around here … he ’s a rapist and he can do it again			0
’ mr @entity7 was put on parole multiple times , and kept raping women in both the @entity3 and @entity72 areas , terrorizing the state with his deviancy			1
furious : @entity32 says he has no choice but to move if the rapist relocates to the neighborhood just a door down from a bus stop : ' you see that right there , past the @entity85 , that 's where the drop the kids off ' mr @entity32 points to and explains officials are also united in their displeasure to dump the rapist in the community			1
the pervert ’s most recent sojourn back into custody came because he could n’t control his violent urges , @entity94 @entity93 told @entity99			2
‘ he belongs in a mental institution , a state hospital ’ mr @entity93 said during a recent press conference , ‘ he does not belong in a community with children where he will once again commit these crimes			0
’ ‘ his past behavior is not a one - time occurrence where he made a mistake			0
we ’re talking over and over again , ’ mr @entity93 added			0
so many arrests : mr @entity7 was released into parole multiple times , and he assaulted women every single time - forcing officials to arrest and reincarcerate him ‘ they 're taking someone who is not from here — who has a horrific criminal record — and they 're dumping him in the [ area ] , ’ a @entity117 city spokesperson told the @entity118			1
‘ we do n't think that 's right , ’ the spokesperson added			0
@entity117 is only a handful of miles from the home slated to house mr @entity7			1
@entity133 authorities are giving the public until nov 29 to voice their concerns			2
a website has been set up for locals to submit comments			2
the modest ranch home was recently listed for rent on @entity141			0
the ad asked $ 850 for the three bedroom , two bath house - it is no longer on the site			0
' that 's crazy ' : @entity58 lives next door , the bus stop is in front of his home , he can not believe officials think the home is suitable for a rapist not in our neighborhood ! : residents are furious the predator is set to live only feet from a school bus stop and within a few miles of multiple schools mr @entity32 called the home ’s owner during a local media report , furiously asking if he knew who the rapist was and asking why he ’d rent to him			1
other locations are also being considered , an official told the @entity118 , but it will be in @entity3			2
mr @entity7 was first arrested in 1972 for multiple rapes in southern @entity133 , he soon admitted raping 20 women , records cited by the @entity118 show			1
only seven years later , he was released from a mental health institution after doctors deemed him a changed man			0
he was snagged again in 1982 for raping more women			0
based on his own estimates , mr @entity7 raped well over 100 women			1
‘ it really angers me , ’ another local resident told the @entity118			0
‘ my wife and i are getting to the point where we 're anxious to leave @entity133 anyway			0
that might get us to ... move quicker			0
’ mr @entity7 will be required to wear a gps monitor at all times , an official told the @entity118			1
the monitor will be able to alert authorities if he violates the terms of his release by beng to close to a school or park , or even if he violates curfew			2
still , that ’s not enough to satisfy people living in the proposed area			0
‘ this is like a bad dream right now because i 'm going to have to move out of this neighborhood , ’ mr @entity32 told @entity33 he does n’t appear to be alone .			2

@entity7 admitted to 41 rape , he told authorities another 70 went unreported
he is set to be released by the end of the year
residents of @entity11 are infuriated he is set to move near schools , a park and a bus stop
