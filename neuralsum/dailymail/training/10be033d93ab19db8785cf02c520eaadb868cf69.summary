a rail union boss was thrown off a live radio programme after making an offensive rant at the show ’s presenter			1
@entity5 , assistant general secretary of the @entity6 , repeatedly asked @entity7 : ‘ have you stopped beating your wife ? ’ the @entity11 radio host had been quizzing mr @entity5 about a @entity13 strike in support of a driver sacked for failing two alcohol breath tests			1
the exchange began when mr @entity7 asked : ‘ why are you supporting a drunk driver ? ’ on - air row : broadcaster @entity7 was forced to cut off union leader @entity5 today after he ranted about a @entity13 strike and asked the @entity11 presenter : ' have you stopped beating your wife ? ' as mr @entity7 pressed for an answer , an increasingly irate mr @entity5 replied with the wife - beating remark			1
when mr @entity7 protested that he was a divorced man , mr @entity5 asked if he ’d stopped beating his ex-wife			1
the mock question about domestic violence is often used to flag up a question that condemns the person who answers it no matter what reply is given			0
mr @entity5 said he was making a point about being asked for a straight yes or no answer in a complex situation			1
there is no suggestion that mr @entity7 ever beat his wife			1
mr @entity5 was speaking in support of @entity42 who allegedly failed the breath tests before starting work on the @entity45			1
‘ he was n’t drinking at work and he was n’t drunk , ’ he said , insisting that the driver ’s diabetes could have led to a false reading			0
but when the union chief kept asking the same question about wife - beating , mr @entity7 took him off air			1
mr @entity7 calmly told him : ‘ goodbye mr @entity54			1
i just find that offensive			0
you had really interesting points to make there			0
‘ clearly you are unhappy with the test			0
clearly , it may have been poorly administered			0
your colleague , i think , appears to have diabetes			0
if he does and that ’s why he failed his test , i will be there to support him			2
’ but he added : ‘ your vile and abusive stance means i never wish to speak to you again			1
you have diminished the case of your colleague immeasurably			0
’ mr @entity5 , from @entity69 , east @entity70 , is one of the union movement ’s most controversial characters and has caused offence with @entity75 posts			1
one , which emerged during his failed attempt to succeed @entity78 as @entity6 chief , showed him in a @entity81 - style military hat with an assault rifle in his hand			1
his @entity75 page contains status updates glorifying @entity13 strikes , with one post reading : ‘ it ’s taken me three hours to drive eight miles : mission accomplished , gridlock achieved , victory to the @entity6			1
’ @entity92 won the race to lead the @entity6 in the election for general secretary last autumn			2
announcing the strike action in @entity70 on tuesday he said : ‘ our members have voted for industrial action and the union will now consult extensively with our representatives before deciding on our next moves in this dispute			1
’ @entity13 had urged union members to vote against strikes			2
spokesman @entity106 said : ‘ strike threats will not alter our commitment to safety , nor will they make us consider reinstating a driver who failed two alcohol breath tests			1
gun - toting militant : @entity6 assistant general secretary , @entity5 , was a contender for the union leadership but lost to @entity92 ‘ we operate a zero tolerance approach towards the consumption of alcohol in order to keep customers and staff safe			1
you would n’t let someone who had been drinking alcohol drive your family in a car , and we do n’t let people who have been drinking alcohol drive people ’s families in tube trains			0
’ mr @entity7 told the @entity131 last night he was considering legal action			1
however , he added : ‘ i would have to balance the fact that i would ultimately be taking money from a union that staffs a vital public service industry			0
’ mr @entity5 said that mr @entity137 has diabetes , which produced a ' false result ' , but when asked if the driver had failed an alcohol test he became irate			1
@entity13 said that the tests take this into account			2
he kept asking mr @entity7 , a divorcee who has never attacked his ex-wife : ' have you stopped beating your wife ? ' - a well known loaded question used in debates about presumed guilt			1
the interview then descended into chaos before the union boss was cut - off			2
mr @entity7 said : ' goodbye mr @entity5			1
i just find that offensive			0
i have tried time and time again			0
i have to take it that your colleague failed			0
' you had really interesting points to make there			0
clearly you are unhappy with the test			0
clearly , it may have been poorly administered			0
your colleague , i think , appears to have diabetes			0
if he is that and that 's why he failed his test , i will be there to support him			2
' messages : mr @entity5 praised ' comrades ' and celebrated disruption after a precious tube strike controversial : the left - winger says that @entity174 is no longer the true @entity175 in another message he added : ' but your vile and abusive stance means i never wish to speak to you again			1
and in my eyes , you have diminished the case of your colleague immeasurably			0
' as an assistant general secretary , you need some form of media training			0
' mr @entity5 is one of the trade union movement 's most controversial characters , causing a offence with a series of @entity75 posts			2
one showed him in a @entity81 - style miltary hat and an assault rifle in his hand and emerged as he ran to replace @entity78			0
his @entity75 page is filled with status updates glorifying @entity13 strikes , with one post reading : ' it 's taken me three hours to drive eight miles : mission accomplished , gridlock achieved , victory to the @entity6			1
' another post exhorts his 2,000 - plus friends not to cross the picket line in a @entity13 strike , saying : ' if you are on our side then respect our picket lines , if you are on the government 's side you will cross the pickets and be remembered as the 21st century @entity214 scabs and class traitors			1
' support yourself by supporting the @entity6 strike			2
do n't cross picket lines			0
' and yet another post , which he later took down , read : ' with three different strikes announced today , i think i 'll enjoy the @entity222 weekend			0
' friends : mr @entity224 salutes with his comrade @entity78 , who died suddenly last year further posts glorify striking @entity6 members , while another attacked ' @entity227 ' [ sic ] @entity228 , saying : ' @entity229 , the @entity174 is well and truly over			2
vote @entity230 and build a workers ' party			0
' millions of commuters face potential travel chaos after @entity13 drivers voted to strike in support of a colleague who was sacked after being found over the drink drive limit twice			1
members of the @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 ( @entity6 ) last night voted by 299 votes to 221 to strike in support of an unnamed driver who failed two random breathalyser tests befopre going on duty			1
although it is unclear when the strike will take place , it is likely to cause major disruption for many of @entity13 ’s four million daily commuters			2
the union argued that the type of breathalyser used did not account for people with diabetes			0
but @entity13 ( @entity13 ) said the breath tests were not affected by the condition			2
and in another post , later taken down , mr @entity5 , who is from @entity69 , in east @entity70 , wrote : ' i 've had to move down the carriage to escape a load of middle - class prats and their mockney accents			2
' posh people really should n't deliberately drop their h 's in an attempt to pretend they are something they clearly are not			0
' after the former @entity274 leader @entity273 died , mr @entity5 wrote : ' @entity275 will have company in hell tonight as another war criminal snuffs it '			2
meanwhile photographs on his @entity75 page support the image of him as a hard - left politician			0
one picture shows him and mr @entity78 grinning at the camera , with mr @entity5 raising his clenched fist in the universal symbol of industrial workers , while another shows him smirking in front of the @entity290			1
@entity92 eventually won the race to lead the @entity6 after the election last autumn .			0
