@entity0 has launched a furious attack on socialite journalist @entity2 after the columnist used his @entity5 column to stand up for @entity6			1
the controversial billionaire told @entity2 that his ex-wife ' always found you toe - curlingly vile ' in a bizarre open letter to the magazine which has now resulted in the 77 - year - old offering to take on mr @entity0 in a cage fight			1
the art dealer 's outburst came after @entity2 wrote that mr @entity0 , 70 , was a ' coward ' and a ' rogue ' , criticising the way he treated his celebrity chef ex-wife			1
face - off : @entity0 , left , and @entity2 , right , could take part in a bare - knuckle cage fight to settle their public feud the advertising mogul , now one of the world 's leading art dealers , made headlines last year when he was pictured apparently throttling ms @entity6 at a restaurant			1
the pair divorced shortly afterwards , and the chef has since accused her ex-husband of being controlling and jealous during their decade - long marriage			2
mr @entity0 claimed that ms @entity6 was a habitual cocaine user , an allegation he later withdrew , during a court case which laid bare the tensions in their relationship and prompted @entity38 to come out in support of the tv personality			1
in his spectator column last week , @entity2 compared mr @entity0 unfavourably to notorious porn baron @entity42 , saying he was a ' coward ' who had a ' bullying manner - against women , that is '			1
the columnist added : ' expecting a pornographer to have a heart is like counting upon @entity0 to act like a gentleman			2
' the art world is full of rogues and pirates , and in my book the heroic man who grabbed @entity6 by the throat is both of these things , and he is most welcome to come and try to grab my little throat anytime			1
' mockery : the @entity5 compared the feud to new film @entity61 , which is about a pair of elderly boxers controversy : the row started when @entity2 stood up for mr @entity0 's ex-wife @entity6 dear ms @entity2 , although the spectator is a lovely read , i always skip your column , i ’m afraid			1
i am simply not interested in your social life			0
i know that you delight in telling readers that your friends of @entity75 nobility find you hilariously entertaining company at their swanky @entity78 parties			0
but it was very hapless of you to spring to @entity6 ’s defence last week , as she always found you toe - curlingly vile , and would have been aghast at having you as her valiant supporter			1
people tell me that in your unreadable column you also like to brag that you are a @entity84 at karate			0
well , me too , old boy			0
but apparently your ‘ fights ’ are genteel affairs , against other soppy geriatrics rolling around the floor in crisp white outfits , in some bit of judokai nonsense			0
mine take place in cages , 20 feet square , unofficial little events with no gloves , no rules , and the loser being carried out , usually battered to bits			0
you will understand why i laughed out loud at your schoolyard boast that i should try throttling a real hard case like you			0
yours , @entity0 in response , mr @entity0 sent an open letter to the magazine in which he claimed that ms @entity6 - whose brother @entity106 and father @entity107 both edited the @entity5 - disliked @entity2 and would be ' aghast ' to have him on her side			1
' it was very hapless of you to spring to @entity6 's defence last week , as she always found you toe - curlingly vile , and would have been aghast at having you as her valiant supporter , ' he wrote			1
he also mocked @entity2 's fighting ability and boasted about his own martial prowess			1
' people tell me that in your unreadable column you also like to brag that you are a black belt at karate , ' he wrote			0

' @entity2 , a multi-millionaire with homes in @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , responded bullishly to mr @entity0 's boasts			2
' i am 77 years old , 5ft 9in and weigh 185lbs , ' he writes in his column this week			0
' i am willing to face him any time under cage - fighting non-rules , which will be a first for me			1
i need three days ' notice			0
' links : ms @entity6 is pictured with her brother @entity106 at a party held by @entity2 in 1991 spectator editor @entity143 likened the feud to new film @entity61 , which sees @entity145 and @entity146 play ageing boxers who are coaxed out of retirement to fight each other			1
he added : ' if @entity2 and @entity0 are serious , we 'd be happy to stage the contest in the garden of the @entity5 , with proceeds from the ticket sales going to @entity155 in @entity135			2
' political strategist @entity156 tweeted : ' @entity0 seeks to correct his public image by offering to give a 77 - year old man a beating			2
he should be in @entity160 ' @entity2 , who runs his own magazine as well as writing for the @entity5 , has attracted his own fair share of controversy over the past few decades			2
he has repeatedly been accused of racism , anti-semitism and fascist sympathies , although his editors have always claimed that his outspoken views are what makes him popular with readers .			2

@entity177 , 70 , responded with letter to @entity179 boasting about his cage - fighting experience and calling his *opponent* a ' soppy geriatric '
