on saturday afternoon in @entity1 , the host nation will walk out for a meaningless third place play - off in a @entity4 they believed they were destined to win			1
the five gold stars on those famous strips — one for each @entity4 won by @entity7 — will be an embroidered reminder of their failure			1
these are footballers feted at home and abroad , paid millions in wages and endorsements , who live to play football in front of adoring fans			2
but on saturday they would rather be anywhere else			0
@entity21 , their inept captain on the night of the semi-final shame , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 will be remembered for ever			2
they are the team who shamed a nation			2
in the hours after tuesday night ’s annihilation , @entity7 ’s shell - shocked players drifted towards a team bus that has ‘ the sixth is coming ’ splashed down the side			1
@entity49 , the hapless striker who is a symbol for this sub-standard @entity7 , admitted the 90 - minute nightmare will never go away			1
‘ it is a scar that will forever live in all our lives , ’ he said			1
@entity21 , his eyes red raw with emotion , said sorry to the @entity68 nation : ‘ i just wanted to see my people smile			0
’ mental scars : most of these players , and @entity49 in particular , will never be forgiven for this defeat deep - rooted : @entity7 's media blamed @entity17 's team but @entity76 thinks the problems are bigger speechless : @entity45 admitted that he has never experienced anything like the 7 - 1 defeat ‘ we can not find the words to explain this situation , ’ admitted @entity81 midfielder @entity45			1
there is talk of the psychological recovery within the @entity7 camp and yet it will take more than a few visits to spiritualist @entity90 to soothe the pain			0
‘ we have three or four days to take some rest and think about the next game , but i ’ve never experienced anything like it , ’ added @entity45			0
there were some obvious fissures in the team , particularly when @entity17 — who wo n’t decide his future until after saturday ’s match — addressed his players in a huddle in the moments after the final whistle			2
many of them were snarling at each other before @entity17 ordered them to applaud the @entity7 supporters			0
misplaced passion : @entity7 will have to go out and play again on saturday in a game none of them will want @entity17 looked his 65 years , a man who won one @entity4 in 2002 and lost another in 18 mad minutes			1
‘ it ’s not easy to begin speaking about this , ’ added @entity45			0
there will be more tears and another rousing rendition of @entity119 before the game they ca n’t play quickly enough			0
it will be a very public shaming .			0

@entity7 thrashed 7 - 1 by @entity24 in @entity4 semi-final

striker @entity49 admits it ' will forever live in all our lives '
