by @entity0 published : 10:56 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 11:42 est , 7 may 2013 rocks discovered off the coast of @entity3 in @entity4 could be part of a hidden continent , according to geologists			1
the granite samples were found when @entity4 's @entity9 ( @entity10 ) dredged the seabed near the @entity12 - a long seismic mountainous ridge that runs along the bottom of the @entity15			1
and now scientists claim the rocks were likely part of a continent that sunk into the ocean when @entity21 and @entity22 drifted apart 100 million years ago - dubbing the discovery the ' @entity24 '			1
a @entity10 member showing one of the rocks from the deep - sea during dredging works , 900 miles off the shore of @entity3			0
according to the @entity10 director , @entity32 , the rocks would be part of the former continent submerged when the @entity15 rose up from the separation of now @entity21 and @entity22 @entity4 's @entity9 dredged the seabed off the coast of @entity3 , near the @entity12			1
among the rocks found were granite samples that are thought to be part of a continent that was submerged by the @entity15 when @entity21 and @entity22 split 100 million years ago the location of the ' @entity42 '			1
granite samples were found 900 miles from @entity3 , near the @entity12 - a mountainous rock formation along the floor of the @entity15 @entity4 's @entity9 ( @entity10 ) dredged the seabed by the @entity47 almost two years ago so it could analyse the rocks buried there			1
a number of granite rocks were among the samples found 900 miles ( about 1,500 kilometres ) from @entity3			2
@entity32 , a top official at @entity4 's @entity9 ( @entity10 ) , told the @entity54 website : ' this could be the @entity24 atlantis			0
' we are almost certain but we must bolster our hypothesis			0
' we will have final ( scientific ) recognition this year when we conduct drilling in the area to retrieve more samples of these rocks			2
' last month a team of scientists from @entity4 and @entity66 took a research submersible called the @entity69 underwater to study the @entity47			0
@entity70 added that what they saw back up his claims about the ' @entity42 ' : ' we began to see that the area could be a piece of the continent that disappeared into the sea millions of years ago			1
' more tests are being carried out on the rocks found , and on the underwater geological formation , to confirm the geologists claims			0
@entity56 is @entity82 for the ' island of @entity84 '			0
it is a legendary island that was first mentioned by @entity86 in his work on @entity88 and @entity89			0
the first reference to the island dates back to about 360 bc. @entity86 claims that @entity56 was similar to a @entity93 army that conquered parts of @entity95 and @entity21 in around 9600 bc. the island was said to have sunk into the ocean after a failed attempt to invade @entity99 , @entity100			2
in 2011 , professor @entity101 from the @entity102 claimed to have found evidence of @entity56 in southwestern @entity104 .			0

granite samples could have been submerged by the @entity15 when @entity21 split from @entity22 100 million years ago
geologists have dubbed this mysterious continent the ' @entity42 '
