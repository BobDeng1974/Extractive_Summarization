it started more than 30 years ago when @entity1 received @entity2 on the @entity3 from his grandparents for @entity5			2
now , aged 43 , mr @entity1 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , has amassed a world record collection of 10,607 video games - a total that grows at a rate of two every day			1
in order to play his mammoth collection , worth around $ 820,000 , he also owns 108 consoles and computers dating back to the 1980s			1
@entity1 , 43 , has broken a @entity16 by collecting 10,607 video games he claims to buy an average of two a day , costing him $ 3,000 a year , and says he now has more than 11,000 in order to play the $ 800,000 worth of games he also has 108 consoles dating back to the 1980s mr @entity1 said : ' when i purchased a copy of the records book in 2011 and saw the current holder 's entry , i knew that i was close if not already over the standing record			1
@entity1 smashed the previous record of 8,616 titles held by former ' king of video games ' @entity31 ' i was delighted when the @entity16 gave me a certificate verifying that i have ' @entity34 ' with the count being 10,607 at the time			1
' i have well over 11,000 unique games in my collection at this point , i average buying about two games every day			2
' i 've had to sell off parts of my collection twice - once in 1989 and once in 1998 - so that 's essentially pressing the reset button			0
' but thankfully i 've since managed to reacquire most of the games over the years again			0
but one still remains elusive - the aptly named @entity45			2
' mr @entity1 started his collection as a 12 - year - old boy when he received @entity2 from his grandparents			1
' i started collecting almost immediately as the @entity3 was my first love and i wanted to get every game available for the console , ' he said			0
' i sold my entire collection in late 1989 to raise money to buy a @entity54			0
' my wife 's father died when she was three , so when we got married in 1998 , we did n't have the traditional father - of - the - bride to help pay for the wedding , so we had to finance most of the festivities ourselves			0
@entity1 sold parts of the collection twice - once in 1989 to buy a @entity54 console , and again in 1998 in order to pay for his wedding the first game he ever owned was @entity2 for the @entity3 , given to him as a @entity5 present ' as a result , i sold off complete collections to help fund our marriage - which was worth every penny			1
' he now spends more than Â£ 1,800 every year on bulking out his collection which smashed the previous record held by @entity31 , nicknamed king of video games in 2010 , who amassed a total of 8,616 titles			0
@entity1 's first ever game was for the colecovision which launched in 1982 and was discontinued in 1985			0

@entity1 , 43 , has collected games since age 12
@entity87 with 10,607 different titles
however that is growing at a rate of two a day and is now past 11,000
he also owns 108 different consoles to play them on
