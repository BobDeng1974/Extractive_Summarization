' when you think of two months ago , when we were not playing our best football , we kept working hard and i think at the moment the confidence is back and we are playing much better football			0
' i think that , at @entity5 , spirit is always crucial to try and win all the games , because it can make a big difference			0
it is especially the case for the top squads and the players that can rotate , because it will be very hard to play on the 26th and the 28th within 48 hours			0

@entity0 , 29 , said : ' we know that we have enough talent in the team			2
' we probably had to improve our performances collectively			0

it cost us a few points			0
