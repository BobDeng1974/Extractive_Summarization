by @entity0 published : 09:02 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 09:56 est , 17 october 2013 experts do not think @entity3 's tomb is the modest mausoleum that was discovered in 2007 his burial place was a mystery for thousands of years , but in 2007 archaeologists believed they had uncovered the tomb of @entity3			1
however , now experts do not think the @entity13 ruler 's tomb is the surprisingly modest mausoleum in discovered in recent years , so the search is on once again to find the king of @entity18 's real resting place			1
the tomb thought to be @entity3 's , who ruled just before the time of @entity22 ' birth , was found in @entity23 , which is a huge complex built under the rule of the king on a circular hill in the desert near @entity29			0
while there was much excitement at the time that the tomb had finally been found , archaeologists now believe that it is too small for a ruler known for his decadence and love of ambitious , large scale architectural projects			2
@entity39 , who lived from 74 bc to 4 @entity40 built a number of lavish building projects including the fortress of @entity44 , but he did so by burdening his people with heavy taxes			1
it was @entity49 historian @entity48 who suggested that the ruler was buried in his own creation of @entity23			0
@entity52 , an archaeologist at the @entity53 , told @entity54 that @entity48 described the body laid out on a gold bed with luxurious fabrics and carried to its final resting place accompanied by a procession made up of subjects and the entire army			2
archaeologist @entity62 proclaimed that he had found @entity3 's tomb in 2007 - a building measuring 10 x 10 metres with a pointed roof - that contained three coffins			1
archaeologists think the modest tomb does not belong to the famous ruler as it is too small and modest for a king who planned and built grand architectural complexes , such as his huge temple ( a model is pictured ) the base of what @entity77 archaeologists thought was @entity39 's tomb , near the @entity81 town of @entity82 it was thought that a coffin of carved red stone was that of the famous ruler , but dr @entity52 and his colleague @entity86 , who also works at the university , are convinced that the coffin does not belong to @entity3			1
they came to this conclusion because the building is smaller than other royal tombs of the time and only has one pyramid			0
the tombs of the @entity96 - the royal dynasty proceeding @entity3 - had seven pyramids			0
dr @entity52 said : ' there is hardly space for 20 people to stand conveniently and there is no respectable gateway to lead in			0
' the archaeologists said the building has an awkward layout with two staircases above the tomb and is not symmetrically aligned with the rest of the complex , which would have been a design faux pas not fit for a king			0
the duo also believe that the ruler , known for his expensive taste , would not have settled for a coffin made of local stones , leading experts to question where the real location of @entity3 's tomb is and to whom the trio of coffins in @entity23 belongs			1
dr @entity52 said that the people buried in the tomb could have been ' very dear ' to @entity3 and might even have been close family members			0
he said that while @entity3 's tomb has not been found , there is much more of @entity23 that has not yet been excavated .			2
