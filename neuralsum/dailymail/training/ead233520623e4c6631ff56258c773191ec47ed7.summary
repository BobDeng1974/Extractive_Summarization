one fan added : ‘ a girl found info on his computer on how to drug children			0
he told her he was thinking of giving kids drugs			0
he does need to be arrested before he infects anyone else			0
’ it emerged that he was filmed committing the sex acts on the baby boy the day after @entity12 final album weapons was released			0
@entity7 , a former boyfriend of @entity110 and television presenter @entity109 , appeared on @entity111 just hours before the incident in april last year			2
