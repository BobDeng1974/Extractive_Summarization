@entity0 has signed up to a @entity2 initiative to share billions of pounds of military hardware with other countries , potentially leaving the @entity0 incapable of fighting its own wars , @entity6 can reveal			1
under the scheme , heavy weapons , aircraft and ships will be pooled in an effort to save money and promote co-operation			1
but last night retired air vice marshal sir @entity14 said military actions such as defending the @entity16 would be impossible if this country were sharing large quantities of vital equipment			1
he said : ' if we intend to act alone , @entity0 simply has to have its own kit			0
lending and borrowing on the scale being envisaged here is n't wise in the long term			0
' @entity0 has signed up to a @entity2 initiative to share billions of pounds of military hardware , including @entity27 tanks @entity0 defence chiefs confirmed that they have signed up to the @entity30 to permit ' flexible sharing ' of equipment between the 28 countries of @entity2 – the security alliance set up after the @entity35			1
the scheme was launched earlier this month and is being run by a branch of the @entity39 military called the @entity40			0
the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) and @entity2 last night declined to disclose details about what assets @entity0 may share , but experts believe the @entity0 could soon agree to let the @entity47 states of @entity48 and @entity49 use its top - secret @entity51 military satellite system			1
retired air vice marshal sir @entity14 fears @entity0 security will be compromised and as @entity0 is without any sea patrol aircraft to protect its airspace from incursions by @entity58 jets , experts believe that a deal will be struck for the @entity0 to borrow a fleet of specialist @entity39 planes			1
tanks , rockets , and heavy artillery may also be shared between countries as the scheme , which has begun with a two - year trial , is rolled out			2
most will be manufactured in the @entity39 and sold to @entity70 states which then agree to share the equipment with their neighbours			0
it is understood @entity0 will benefit financially from any leasing arrangements when it buys kit which it then makes available to @entity2 partners for collective use			2
but sir @entity14 fears @entity0 security will be compromised by the scheme			1
he said : ' @entity0 can not be continually lending and borrowing equipment which is vital to national security – not if we ever intend to act independently , as we would be required to if the security of the @entity16 were compromised			2
' it smacks of defence on the cheap and it is sickening that it is being introduced at a time when @entity58 is increasing its military spending			0
' lord @entity88 , former head of the @entity89 , said that although the scheme offered efficiencies , it was going down ' a tricky road '			0
he added : ' the introduction of this scheme should not be used by @entity2 members , @entity0 included , as an excuse to further reduce defence spending			0
' an @entity41 spokesman said last night : ' the @entity0 will of course consider this opportunity along with all other procurement options on a case - by - case basis to ensure maximum value for money for the taxpayer			0
