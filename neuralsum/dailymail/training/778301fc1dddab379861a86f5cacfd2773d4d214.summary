walking up the aisle in their wedding finery , they look like any other nervous couple about to tie the knot			0
but this blushing bride has a secret camera hidden in her bouquet – and is about to expose the marriage as a sham			1
playing her part in a tv sting operation , undercover journalist @entity12 helped to reveal how easy it is for immigrants to marry @entity17 for @entity19 visas			1
@entity27 agreed to pay £ 5,000 to marry his @entity19 bride , while the fixer – known only as @entity48 – was to take a further £ 400			1
@entity27 even offered @entity49 an extra £ 10,000 if she would have a baby with him			2
to make their relationship seem more authentic , he hired a @entity53 to drive her to the register office and even took her shopping for a wedding dress			1
the most difficult moment came before the big day , when the couple were interviewed by a registrar who wanted to make sure their love was real			2
amazingly , @entity27 forgot his bride ’s address and could n’t even name the borough where she lived – but they were still allowed to set a wedding date			1
the filmmakers said the registrar , who was not named , did report his suspicions to the @entity71 but the case simply ‘ slipped through the net ’			1
the sham ceremony was only called off at the last moment , when the registrar asked if anyone present knew of any lawful impediment to the marriage			1
at that point , journalist @entity79 – who was posing as miss @entity12 ’s best man with his own hidden camera in his button – stepped up and revealed they had filmed the entire process			2
the pair met through a ' fixer ' who advertised her services on @entity43 and @entity27 agreed to pay £ 5,000 to marry his @entity19 bride in dramatic footage that will be shown on @entity91 tomorrow , @entity27 is last seen fleeing from the register office			1
before the ceremony , he had boasted to the undercover team that he would use the marriage to get a @entity19 passport			1
he explained he had been living on a student visa , despite the fact he never attended classes , and admitted he had been surviving on ‘ cash in hand ’ work			0
as the visa was about to expire , he was urgently looking for a @entity17 bride to help him stay in the country			0
@entity27 told @entity49 she would be free to leave him immediately after the wedding ceremony , although they would have to wait five years before they divorced			2
i object ! but @entity79 , pictured behind the couple , stopped the ceremony when the registrar asked the congregation if anyone had any objections to the marriage rumbled : the journalists said they never expected the ceremony , assuming it would be blocked by the safeguards that are in place - but it was n't he even invented a back - story to help them fool the authorities , claiming they had met a year - and - a - half ago at @entity127 tube station in @entity128 when miss @entity12 had lost her travel card			1
he told his prospective bride : ‘ when i get the card , you can leave			0
that ’s it , me and you			0
if i want a passport i need only one signature , that ’s it			0
‘ i want to make money			0
why do i have to go to university ? i came here to make money			0
’ interviewed on the programme , @entity141 , superintendent registrar at @entity142 , said the number of sham marriages was ‘ absolutely enormous ’			2
he said : ‘ in @entity128 we see that possibly one in five of our marriages are suspicious			0
‘ the goal is always the @entity19 passport			1
it is like gold dust			0
‘ we had a @entity153 girl who spoke no @entity154 marrying a @entity156 male who spoke @entity19 and @entity157			2
i asked them how they communicate and they told me “ through @entity161 ”			0
’ the journalists said they have made all their evidence available to the police			0
mr @entity79 said : ‘ neither @entity27 nor @entity48 are hardened criminals			2
they tried to play the system , but lost			0
getaway : the groom is then seen fleeing from the register office			0
it is not known whether he was arrested or charged for attempting to set up a sham marriage ‘ the truth is we never expected to end our investigation with a sham marriage ceremony			1
we assumed the road would be blocked by the safeguards that are in place			0
’ it is not known whether @entity27 or @entity48 have been arrested or charged for attempting to set up a sham marriage			1
earlier this year , the @entity183 select committee said that sham marriages are ‘ spiralling out of control ’ in the @entity19 , with as many as 10,000 fake weddings carried out each year			1
the filmmakers refused to name the registry office or the officials who gave permission for the ceremony because they were ‘ testing the system , not seeking to ... blame individuals ’			0
the @entity194 will be shown on @entity91 tomorrow at 9pm .			1
