by @entity0 published : 10:06 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:46 est , 25 february 2014 they say he survives on a wing and a prayer , but daredevil @entity7 needed a little more skill than faith as he took on his latest breathtaking challenge			1
in this amazing footage @entity7 uses a wingsuit to pass underneath the arm of the @entity16 statue in @entity17 , along with fellow adrenaline junkie @entity18			1
the pair flew up to 6,500ft on trikes - motorised hang gliders used to give tourists aerial views of the city - before leaping off			2
the statue stands almost 100ft tall and has an arm span of 92ft in his sights : @entity41 said the stunt was nearly called off due to wind , and that after making the decision to go ahead he was nervous and scared the duo were supposed to be accompanied by @entity47 , but only two trikes were available on the day so he had to be left on the ground			1
the jump was nearly abandoned in its entirety because of wind conditions around the statue , which could have blown the jumpers off course and caused a fatal accident			2
however , @entity56 remained determined			0
he said : ' we did not come to @entity17 to not fly past the @entity59 statue			0
when we made that decision i felt my heartbeat pounding and i became really scared and nervous			0
' after assessing the weather conditions and deciding they could make the leap , @entity7 and @entity18 set off in the early hours to get the cleanest run possible			2
the best view in @entity17 : fellow sportsman @entity18 , from @entity67 , filmed the stunt by flying above @entity7 and using a camera on his chest the dangerous stunt was completed using one of these specially designed wingsuits which slow down the wearer 's free - fall speed allowing them more control in the air a third man , @entity47 ( pictured ) was also supposed to jump , but was unable to because of a lack of trikes - motorised hang gliders the athletes used to get into position on the jump itself @entity7 was nominated to fly underneath the arm himself , as he was most comfortable in the suit , while @entity18 flew above him and used a camera strapped to his chest in order to film the stunt			1
luckily , the dangerous manouvre passed off without a hitch			0
the wingsuit fliers landed at a @entity17 roundabout in the early hours , before heading back to their hotel for a celebratory breakfast beer .			0

*extreme* sportsman @entity7 flew underneath the left arm of the @entity16 statue using a wingsuit
