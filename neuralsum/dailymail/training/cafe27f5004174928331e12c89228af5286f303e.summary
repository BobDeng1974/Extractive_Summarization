by @entity0 my husband and i recently had a five - star holiday from hell			1
there we were , surrounded by serene , white sanded beaches , on a glamorous and remote beach resort teeming with a-list amenities , but utterly stressed out and miserable			1
how did this happen ? easy			1
it was the cataclysmic combination of a teething , jet lagged , overly excited one - year - old jumping around in the lap of five - star luxury			1
@entity0 says that when it comes to holidays with the kids you have to be prepared to be frank , it 's all my fault			1
my rookie mistake was neglecting to realise that the former holidays my husband and i looked forward to needed to be adapted for this new addition to our lives			1
luxe and babies do n't always mix , to say the least			2
and from the beginning i made several key mistakes			2
@entity0 shares her top tips on how to have a stress - free holiday with an infant for example , as a @entity37 , constant sunshine may be your most longed - for companion , but as a mum , it 's your mortal enemy			1
steep terrain represents a great way to work off breakfast but a horrible obstacle course for a newly walking baby			2
and long distances from an airport can be a relaxing opportunity to soak up local colour when alone , but alongside a baby who hates her car seat , i can promise you , it 's a quick trip to hell			1
our biggest problem however , was the resort itself			2
the venue was completely unsuitable			2
marble floors and pure white interiors do not a baby - friendly vacation make			1
@entity66 edges and sedate and elegant restaurants were the stuff of nightmares when combined with a one - year - old			1
and believe me , i am well aware from my single years that just because i love being around my baby , i do not assume that others feel the same			2
after careful research , and in an effort to correct my unfortunate errors , we recently took one more trip - this time with a lot more forethought and care			1
and happily , i discovered that with the right planning , babies and luxe holidays can in fact find a way to happily co-exist			2
the first thing i did was shift gears regarding the location			2
i began looking at villas to rent rather than hotel rooms			2
we were delighted to find a stunning five - bedroom property in @entity92 , @entity93 , called @entity94			1
@entity96 views from every room , a games room , huge terraces for bbqs and laying out and a gorgeous infinity pool			2
set up with children in mind , the villa also came with a high chair , baby cot , safety gates , and a walker			2
this time , we travelled with extended family which meant more babysitters – bonus ! plus there were no more worries about our frequently loud dinner companion annoying nearby diners			2
from £ 220 per night			2
for bookings call 0788 082 3393 @entity118 keep it familiar			2
i have learned the hard way that babies do n't love change			2
time zones are unavoidable , and whist new places , new faces , appeal initially , frequently we were faced with grouchiness when routines and locations shifted dramatically			2
@entity132 's travel cots are incredibly lightweight making them perfect for holidays this time i packed smarter and included her own bedding			2
@entity132 , famous for their carriers makes a gorgeous new travel cot , the @entity140 , £ 199.99			0
there are no loose parts or complicated assembly and it 's high quality , safe and also easy to carry on a plane			0
it made for a good sleep away from home			0
at least that 's how our baby seems to view it			0
i am openly envious of all my friends who report that their baby just loves long drives in the car			0
what helped us was a @entity162 car seat which is one of the safest ( five - point safety harness ) but allows her to sit up and see a bit more around her			1
@entity0 loves the @entity167 car seat which has a light that appears when you 've reached the correct strap tension for the baby , making sure it 's never too tight or loose i loved the @entity173 , which has a light that appears when you 've reached the correct strap tension for the baby , making sure it 's never too tight or loose			1
suitable for children aged nine months to four years old / 9kg - 18kg , and costs £ 170			1
i will never again travel without a pushchair that she likes			0
we have been using @entity184 's @entity183 after i spotted @entity185 using the same and decided to check it out			0
it 's a sleek , stylish option and looks far more expensive than it is			0
baby loves it as it 's a smooth ride and i loved that it folds up without taking the seat off			0
it also stands on its own when folded ( a plus behind doors ) , has great suspension and good on uneven roads			0
it costs £ 600 from www.shopnuna.co.uk			0
@entity0 got pram envy when she saw @entity185 with this pushchair and had to try it out planes and cars demand distractions			1
i have learned to pack a bag specifically with toys , a bottle and snacks just for the trip			1
the @entity210 is designed for four - to nine - year - olds but i discovered even my one - year - old loves it			1
games , ebooks , music are all loaded but i loved that it has an adult content filter on their wifi ( powered by @entity219 ) which means the web is the kid - friendly environment they deserve			1
parents can then rest assured that every web - based content experience is safe and age - appropriate			1
try the new @entity227 app which i 'm pretty sure will do the trick			0
@entity210 £ 89.99 is available in major retailers , including @entity230 and @entity231			0
@entity0 says that the @entity210 is the perfect way to keep kids entertained on long flights let someone else do the work for you			1
in addition to the villa , we stayed at @entity241			0
it was recently named the best resort in @entity93 for families , so we figured we were on the right track			0
set on a stunning bay in @entity247 , this stylish , yet fun , hotel has some of the prettiest views i 've ever seen			1
it 's all - inclusive and the buffet area is boisterous with utterly fantastic food on offer , including a ' baby chef ' who makes bespoke food for tots , with disposable bibs available at every meal			1
the kids ' clubs were heavenly : a private and shaded pool , a bouncy castle for little ones and basketball court , water polo , @entity268 and @entity269 for pre-teens			0
@entity0 says that the @entity271 offers great facilities to babies , children , teenagers and adults they also look after grown ups : a @entity280 - inspired spa – with a soothing massage up in a treehouse - a beachside disco , and two adult - only beaches			1
they also have a @entity286 which allows you to order cocktails from your loungechair			0
@entity290 and @entity291 on umbrella 7			0
a few gadgets @entity295 ( £ 16 ) offers fantastic sun and heat protection in the car			0
it attaches to any window and offers two levels of sun protection , the first reducing glare and filtering uv rays and the second acting as a black - out shade which blocks all sunlight and reduces heat			1
it was much better than moving the car seat from side to side during long drives which we were doing previously			0
nap time is tricky on holiday but @entity317 was a hero			1
it 's a breathable sleep and sun shade that gives high uv protection and keeps wind , chill , light rain and insects at bay whilst out and about in the buggy			0
it 's also nice and dark inside			0
the stow n @entity327 makes travelling with a baby less of a handful created by @entity332 specialists , @entity330 stops trapped water getting in baby 's ears in the pool and can help prevent ear infections			0
it 's all natural and can be used on babies from 6 months onwards			0
i also loved the @entity342 , an organiser which hooks over the car seat in front of baby and has seven pockets and two drink holders in a washable and waterproof fabric			0
perfect for hoarding all the bribery implements required			0
£ 13.00 , available from @entity351 and @entity352 for @entity353 : no list would be complete without something for the beleaguered baby 's travel companion			0
@entity359 salons in @entity360 and @entity361 do a @entity362 , great for pre-holiday grooming my top tips @entity359 salons in @entity360 and @entity361 do a @entity366 blow out			1
it 's his version of the @entity370 blow out better suited to those of us with finer hair than our @entity375 friends			0
it costs around £ 100 and will give you a glossy , smoothed look throughout your holiday , during when you will almost certainly never , ever find time to blow dry your hair			1
@entity384 had one on earlier this week but fans of @entity388 's brand include @entity389 , @entity390 , @entity391 and @entity392 – all frequent fliers			0
her new portable @entity395 masks are skinny to pack , can go in a carry on and you can move around easily while they 're on – no laying still necessary			0
@entity383 's oxygen masks are popular with celebs like @entity391 and @entity389 @entity0 would n't be without her @entity400 on holiday and it saves extra room in the case for souvenirs ! i love how they take my dried up airplane face and make it look like i 've just had a facial			1
do n't leave home without them			0
if you still have n't bit the bullet and bought an ereader , maybe now 's the time			0
so much lighter than carting around books , back lit so you can read in the hotel room without the need of a night light , battery last for weeks , can read with one hand and no screen glare in the sunshine			0
i especially love the fact that if you become exasperated by the book you 're reading you 're certainly not stuck with it for the rest of the holiday £ 169 on @entity231			1
babies add love and laughter to everything , but i 've learned the hard way that holidays are a lot more fun for mum and dad than little ones who love routine			1
turning a holiday from hell into a spectacular getaway has less to do with a price tag and everything to do with gaining a clear picture of what every family member , even the littlest one , is looking for in a holiday experience .			1
