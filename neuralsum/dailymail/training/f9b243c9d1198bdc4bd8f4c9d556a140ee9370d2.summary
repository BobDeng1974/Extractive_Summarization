@entity0 has wasted £ 250,000 of its aid budget trying to bring green electricity to a community of 55 people in the @entity5			1
the £ 1.7million scheme was scrapped after @entity8 contractors pocketed huge amounts of cash without building any wind turbines on the islands made famous by the @entity13			1
a report from the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) admitted officials had failed to ‘ rigorously manage ’ the @entity17 ’ eco project			0
wasted energy : @entity0 has wasted £ 250,000 of its aid budget trying to bring green electricity the @entity17 islands population : there are only around 55 people on the islands , making the original scheme cost the equivalent of £ 31,000 per head by the time the scheme was abandoned it had slipped three years behind schedule and doubled in initial costs			1
the @entity0 first took responsibility for the remote volcanic islands after they were inhabited by mutinous sailors from the crew of the @entity38 in 1789			1
led by @entity40 , they settled there to escape the hangman ’s noose after staging a rebellion against captain @entity45			0
all of the rocky outcrop ’s inhabitants can trace their roots back to members of the crew of the @entity38			0
two years ago the @entity51 revealed that the overseas territory received £ 2.4million a year from @entity0 taxpayers – more than £ 43,000 per person every year			0
mutiny : @entity56 sailor @entity40 led the mutiny against captain @entity45 on @entity38 in 1789 now , documents reveal £ 250,000 of the @entity0 ’s aid budget has been wasted trying to bring wind power to the descendants of the ship ’s mutinous crew			1
during the fiasco the @entity0 taxpayer ended up having to foot the bill for chartering a ship to take equipment to the islands			0
but the charter had to be cancelled because the shipment was not ready to transport			0
eventually officials from @entity15 decided to abandon the scheme			0
experts are now trying to convince them that a solar - powered generator would be a better option			0
critics have questioned why the islands need such an expensive green electricity system in the first place			1
there are only around 55 people living there – so the original scheme cost the equivalent of £ 31,000 per head			1
now , if @entity15 gives the green light to the new solar - powered generator , the total cost of the island ’s electricity supply will be even higher than the estimated bill for the original project			1
aid bosses say the government has a duty to spend cash on the island , as it is still a @entity100			1
@entity101 take priority from the aid budget under laws set down in the @entity105			2
but the government has been roundly criticised for ring - fencing the @entity0 ’s aid spending in a time of austerity			2
foreign aid is one of the few departments not to have faced a cut in funding			2
a report into the defunct scheme explains : ‘ the contractors engaged in 2007 completed the first stages of the project			2
‘ however , due to continual late submission dates of key deliverables and escalating costs , which more than doubled , the time frame stretched by three years			0
’ scrapped : the £ 1.7million scheme was axed after @entity8 contractors pocketed huge amounts of cash without building any wind turbines , such as these in @entity129 ( file picture ) a @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ where contracts are not good value for money and are not being properly delivered , we will take action to protect taxpayer money			1
‘ the @entity0 @entity96 will be working with the @entity17 government in order to assess the current and future energy needs , including green options such as solar power			2
’ but @entity142 , from the @entity143 ’ @entity144 , said : ‘ it ’s frankly typical of @entity15 to waste so much taxpayers ’ money on a project that delivers so little			0
‘ one of the consequences of spending up to an arbitrary aid target is that there is little incentive for officials to deliver value for taxpayers ’ money			2
no one has been held to account for the repeated blunders over this project			0
