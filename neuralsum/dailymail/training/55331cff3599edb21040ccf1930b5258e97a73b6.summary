by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 15:26 est , 25 march 2013 members of a gang who abused shoppers , threatened staff and chased children before ripping phones and @entity8 off walls in 42 stores across @entity11 have been jailed for a total of 11 years			1
@entity14 footage from one attack on their £ 500,000 crime spree shows a mother sprinting to protect her terrified son as the eight men swamped and then burgled a @entity21			2
on each occasion the criminals caused ' total mayhem ' when they stormed high street shops to wrench high - value items from the walls in a series of violent ' steaming ' raids			1
in scenes reminiscent of the recent @entity30 , phones and tablet computers worth a total of £ 143,000 were ripped out by the thieves , while the attacks caused more than £ 50,000 worth of damage			1
the clean - up operation after the raids , which forced some stores to close temporarily , resulted in @entity21 losing a total of more than £ 500,000 , the court heard			1
passing sentence , judge @entity72 said : ' this conspiracy to burgle consists of a series of offences in which a number of young men rushed into branches of @entity21 and simply grabbed whatever they were able to and ran away			1
' in some cases , efforts were made to disguise appearances , but in many cases the attitude of those who committed these offences was brazen			2
' those who have joined the conspiracy have applied themselves to a criminal operation of which the overall effect was very great			0
' the targeting of particular premises and the mob handed means of offending indicates greater harm			1
' the success ( of the conspiracy ) depended on force of numbers and shock			0
' many staff and customers were very frightened			0
' in one incident , a small child found himself , much to his terror and that of his parents , being surrounded by the marauding group			0
' most of the events saw participation by more than those who have admitted responsibility for them			0
' sentenced : ( @entity117 ) @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , and @entity121 were part of the gang that raided 40 stores in a £ 500,000 crime spree across @entity11 judge @entity72 also praised the ' good old fashioned police work ' involved in bringing the gang to justice			1
the ' steaming ' spree took place between july 1 , 2012 and january 11 this year , prosecutor @entity130 told the court			1
' the defendants had a total disregard for the presence of customers , old or young , when they were embarking on their criminal enterprise			2
' they were always mob handed and caused total chaos			1
children were pushed out of the way and forced to run away			0
' these young men , of various ages , with the youngest being just 14 at the time of the ending , targeted @entity149 through the @entity11 and @entity151 area			1
' in groups of three or more , they went into the premises , mostly during the afternoon , and literally ripped telephones from their displays			2
' the shops were operating as normal and the staff were on duty at the time serving customers , and of course they were terrified by what occurred			2
' children can be seen running for cover to their parents			0
' horror : the frozen child is shown in the bottom right of the screen as the criminals pull electronics from the walls around him fear : a mother then tears across to protect the young boy from the marauding gang shocked shoppers who happened to get in the way of the enterprise were simply told to stand aside or else			1
' there was a menace , do n't mess with us , if you get in the way there is going to be trouble , ' said mr @entity130			0
' the staff say they were extremely shocked and frightened by what occurred			0
they were not only frightened for themselves but also for their customers			0
' the psychological effect can not be minimised and the reality is that the consequences ( for shop staff and ' customers ) have been profound			0
more thugs who took part in the raids remain at large and none of the goods have been recovered			0
' the fact of the matter is the crimes themselves seem to have occurred within the context of the individuals really not caring who is in the shop at the time			0
' they went in to steal and caused total mayhem , ' added mr @entity130			1
@entity211 , 22 , who was on licence for robbery at the time of the attacks , was jailed for four years , while @entity118 , 21 , was given a 27 - month prison term			1
@entity217 , 18 , was handed a 12 - month detention and training order , while @entity121 , also 18 , was locked up for 26 months in a young offenders ' institute			2
@entity222 , 18 , was handed a suspended 18 - month prison sentence and was also ordered to complete 80 hours unpaid work			2
@entity225 , 20 , was also spared jail with an 18 month prison sentence suspended for 24 months			0
he was also ordered to complete 150 hours unpaid work			0
all six admitted their part in the plot , together with two juveniles , aged 15 and 16 , who can not be named			0
they were each handed 10 - month and 18 - month detention and training orders respectively			2
@entity211 , of @entity235 , southeast @entity11 ; @entity120 , of @entity236 ; @entity121 , of @entity237 , @entity238 ; @entity217 , of @entity239 , @entity240 ; @entity118 , of @entity242 , northwest @entity11 ; and @entity243 , of @entity244 , @entity238 , all admitted a single count of conspiracy to burgle			1
