@entity0 runs you through what we learned from the midweek round of fixtures ... with some star turns and a look through the leagues , too			0
this week sees reason to celebrate for @entity10 and @entity11 , but less so for @entity12			1
1 @entity10 ’s middle name is happy – and the young @entity15 defender has every right to feel that way after starting to force his way into @entity20 ’s thinking			1
the 20 - year - old is emerging as a genuine threat to @entity23 centre back @entity24 ’s place alongside @entity26 after getting picked in six of @entity28 ’s last nine games			1
the 1 - 0 win over @entity30 was the fourth of those in which @entity28 have kept a clean sheet			1
@entity10 has impressed in @entity28 's defence since featuring more often alongside @entity26 2 @entity11 is emerging as a candidate to join only three players to have ever collected both the @entity38 and @entity40 awards in the same season			1
the 21 - year - old @entity43 striker is already a shoo - in for the @entity38 prize after his explosive arrival in @entity47 ’s team			0
but if he keeps up his current rate he could well follow former @entity43 idol @entity49 who won both prizes two years ago			0
after scoring at @entity51 now has 13 @entity53 goals despite not getting a start in the @entity43 side until november			1
that ’s exactly the same number @entity49 had scored at the same stage of the 2012 - 13 season – and he ’d been a regular in the team			2
3 @entity12 scored 26 goals in all competitions for @entity63 last season but now finds himself as the striker with most to fear from @entity67 ’s arrival			2
when £ 28million new boy @entity67 gets back from the @entity69 it will push the @entity71 striker even further down the pecking order			0
hauled off after an hour when @entity63 failed to beat @entity73 on saturday , he was used only as a sub for the last 17 minutes of the 4 - 1 win at @entity76 and has only once played 90 minutes in the @entity53 all season			1
@entity12 will be pushed further down the pecking order at @entity63 with the arrival of @entity67 4 @entity80 might have a reputation for producing committed teams but he also insists on discipline and will want to sort out new signing @entity84			1
the £ 4.75million man arrived at @entity87 from @entity88 with a reputation for reckless tackling , with a red card and five yellows already this campaign			0
and he was fortunate to escape with only a yellow for a lunging tackle on @entity97 ’s @entity96 during @entity87 ’s 2 - 0 win			0
@entity84 ( right ) has shown no sign of curbing his committed style since joining @entity87 5 @entity101 seems to be starting to feel the pace of his first full @entity53 season , or maybe defenders have begun to work out the 29 - year - old @entity105			1
@entity101 exploded on to the scene at @entity107 with nine goals in his first 12 matches for @entity111 ’s team			2
but the former @entity113 striker has now gone eight @entity53 games without a goal following the 0 - 0 draw against 10 - man @entity117			1
@entity101 has failed to find the net for eight games after a bright start to the season for @entity107 6 @entity123 spent the early part of the season being switched around the @entity127 line - up under @entity128 , including a spell when he had to do a job at left back			1
since @entity131 took over he ’s been moved back to his best role at right back and his performances have been one of the keys to @entity127 ’s run of just one defeat in seven games under their new boss			2
@entity131 has kept an unchanged back four in every one of those matches			0
@entity123 has been instrumental in helping @entity127 pull clear of the relegation zone 7 @entity142 asked why @entity143 did n’t keep @entity144 at @entity145 when he took over from sir @entity146 and the question has even more relevance following his impact at @entity73			0
apart from a brief spell helping out at @entity151 the experienced 52 - year - old had been out of work since he followed @entity146 out of @entity154			0
but in two matches since @entity156 recruited him to halt his team ’s slide into the relegation zone @entity73 have taken four points			0
@entity144 ( right ) has helped @entity73 take four points from their last two @entity53 matches 8 @entity162 will have to win his next four matches at @entity88 to have a better record after 17 matches than the one which got @entity168 the sack in november			1
owner @entity170 lost patience with @entity168 when he ’d taken just 16 points from the first 17 games despite signing 11 new players in the summer			1
@entity162 has been allowed to bring in eight fresh faces , but after the 3 - 0 defeat at @entity179 has just six points from 13 matches			2
@entity162 has struggled since taking over from @entity168 at @entity88 in november 9 @entity180 has used @entity182 ’s profits from their run to the @entity184 wisely in signing @entity186 winger @entity185			1
the 26 - year - old whose career started at @entity190 then @entity191 had 14 goals already this season when he signed for the @entity194 – and that is now 15 after marking his debut by scoring in the 4 - 1 win over @entity198			0
@entity180 ’s side go to @entity201 leaders @entity202 on saturday with a chance to get into the promotion shake - up			0
they are in sixth place , but with two games in hand on most of their rivals			2
10 @entity210 ’s return to @entity212 football after spending time in @entity213 is reaching crisis point at @entity215			0
the 44 - year - old built a strong reputation taking @entity218 then @entity219 to play - off finals , but after flopping at @entity221 and @entity222 needed a success story when he was put in charge at @entity226 following the controversial sacking of long - serving boss @entity228			0
the 2 - 0 defeat at @entity230 means he has won only once in 13 games , and the @entity233 were forced to deny stories he had been sacked in the wake of the defeat .			2

@entity28 kept another clean sheet with @entity10 alongside @entity26
@entity80 may want to curb @entity84 's committed style
@entity101 has not scored in eight @entity53 games
@entity162 is on the verge of having a worse record than @entity168
