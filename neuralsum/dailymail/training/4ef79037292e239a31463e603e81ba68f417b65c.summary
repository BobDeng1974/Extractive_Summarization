angry parents have criticised a school after senior teachers sent home children wearing their @entity5 uniforms on @entity6 because it breached its uniform rules			1
pupils at @entity10 , in @entity11 , had donned their blue uniforms in honour of @entity15 's fallen soldiers on monday			1
@entity16 , 15 , @entity17 , 16 , and @entity18 , 15 , made the decision to pay their own tribute while the nation fell silent during the two minute act of remembrance			1
upsetting : students ( left to right ) @entity16 , 15 , @entity17 , 16 , and @entity18 , 15 , were all sent home from school for wearing their @entity29 uniforms on @entity6 but they were stunned when teachers threw them out of class just after 11am - because the cadet uniforms broke school rules			1
they were told by headteacher @entity34 they could only return once they had changed out of the military attire and into their school uniform			2
today the families of the schoolchildren - who are all members of the 1047 @entity43 of @entity44 squadron - branded the decision ' disrespectful			1
' @entity18 's father , @entity46 , 47 , from @entity47 , @entity48 , was contacted at 11.30am by the school to inform him his daughter would be leaving lessons at midday			1
the project engineer said : ' i do n't think there is anything wrong with it			2
in fact , i am proud that @entity58 wanted to wear it			1
' she is a very good student and she feels strongly about it			2
' we thought it was just respectful to show it would n't just be a normal day			2
' we wanted to show it does actually matter			0
' indignant : the headteacher at @entity67 and sports college in @entity11 maintained today that the cadet uniforms broke school rules @entity16 's mother @entity71 , 45 , added : ' i 'm utterly shocked			1
' these youngsters take a lot of pride and they are on the right track			0
' why ca n't the school see why they are doing it ? ' another parent , who did not wish to be named , said : ' you would think the school could make an exception on such a day - its not like they were going along in fancy dress			0
' the @entity5 uniform is smart and always impeccable - they were not going to lessons dressed like scruffs			0
' they were raising awareness for a great cause			0
' it is a disgrace , you would think common sense would prevail on such an occasion as @entity6			0
' students were told they could not return to the school until they had changed back into their jumpers and ties			0
headteacher @entity34 said it was school policy for children to wear their uniforms at all times			1
he added : ' they were not wearing school uniform			0
' they were asked to return to school once they had changed into school uniform			0
' as is our normal practice the parents of the students were contacted first and we made it explicit that they should return to school once changed			2
' this process is in line with the guidelines in the @entity118 for @entity119 , governing bodies , @entity121 , @entity122 '			0

@entity16 , 15 , @entity17 , 16 , and @entity18 , 15 , sent home at midday
parents call decision ' disrespectful ' and say they are ' proud ' of their children
@entity10 in @entity11 maintains it was right to act
