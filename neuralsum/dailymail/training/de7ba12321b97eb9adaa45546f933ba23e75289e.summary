a bungling @entity1 bomber blew off his own legs when he hurled a grenade at @entity5 police outside a @entity7 school - which bounced off a tree and then exploded at his feet			1
a bizarre sequence of explosions in the capital of @entity7 started this morning when a stash of explosives blew off the roof of a house occupied by three @entity1			1
two of the men quickly ran away while @entity19 , who was seriously wounded , staggered out and tried to wave down a taxi			1
covered in blood , the driver refused to take him , and so he hurled a grenade at the vehicle			1
when police arrived on the scene he then tried to throw another at officers - but it bounced off a tree , landed at his feet , and blew off his legs			1
mistake : @entity1 @entity19 , who is still alive , had his legs blown off after a grenade he hurled bounced back onto him , as police closed in on him outside a @entity7 school investigation : a @entity5 @entity36 team member analyses the damage following the blasts in @entity7 while a large crowd gathers at the scene - many taking pictures @entity19 , who was taken to hospital , injured four people in the blasts which come the day after @entity45 diplomats were targeted in simultaneous car bombings , also believed to have been carried out by @entity1			1
photographs and video footage of the wounded @entity19 showed him covered in dark soot on a pavement strewn with broken glass			2
he lay in front of a @entity5 primary and secondary school , head raised as if he was attempting to sit up or look around			0
it is not yet known if yesterday 's and today 's attacks are linked - but @entity45 defence minister @entity58 said the @entity7 violence ' proves once again that @entity1 and its proxies continue to perpetrate terror '			1
another government minister implied @entity45 would seek revenge , without mentioning @entity1 explicitly			1
and public security minister @entity64 told @entity65 : ' we know who carried out the terror attacks , we know who sent them , and @entity45 will settle the score with them			2
' more explosives were found at @entity19 's house , in the @entity76 area of central @entity7 , which police say he had been renting with two others			1
he is believed to have arrived in @entity7 , from the southern @entity5 resort of @entity81 , on february 8			0
peace : the bomber lies seriously wounded on the pavement while emergency services wait for the area to be made safe before going in to assist carnage : a bomb disposal expert checks out the damage , which also hit a police car warning : @entity45 and the @entity91 have told their citizens to be alert in the capital police said security forces at @entity7 's international airport detained a second @entity1 later today			1
@entity98 , one of the men in the house where the explosives first went off , was trying to board a flight for @entity103			0
they said a third @entity1 - believed wounded in that initial explosion - was also on the run			0
@entity5 has rarely been a target for foreign terrorists , although a domestic @entity110 insurgency in the country 's south has involved bombings of civilian targets			0
@entity45 and the @entity91 warned their citizens to be alert in the capital , but @entity5 authorities said the country appeared to have been a staging ground but not the target of any attack			0
it comes the day after @entity45 diplomats were targeted in simultaneous bomb plots which were also blamed on @entity1			2
it is not known whether the attacks are linked			0
a bomb attached magnetically to a car in the @entity130 capital @entity131 exploded and injured the wife of an @entity45 official and two bystanders			0
officials in @entity136 said an explosive device was attached to the bottom of a diplomat â€™s car in the capital @entity142 , but was found and defused before it detonated			0
@entity45 leader @entity144 said @entity1 was behind both incidents , adding that the @entity148 's @entity147 ally @entity149 - which battled @entity45 in a month - long war in 2006 - could have been involved too			2
last month , a @entity147 - @entity152 man with alleged links to @entity149 militants was detained by @entity5 police			0
he led authorities to a warehouse filled with more than 4,000kilos of urea fertiliser and several gallons of liquid ammonium nitrate			0
