first lady @entity0 has taken heat for her low - calorie and low - fat push in school lunchrooms and vending machines , but her punishing food austerity has spared the @entity8 occupants whom her husband needs to please most : journalists			1
the @entity8 press corps does n't get many perks – tiny bathrooms , tinier cubicles and awful coffee are the norm – and reporters pay for their own snacks			1
but while soy chips and apple slices have replaced @entity22 bars and @entity23 in hundreds of thousands of vending machines nationwide , the one adjacent to the @entity8 press briefing room has escaped untouched			1
one reporter snapped a photo of the machine 's artery - clogging jackpot , a 590 - calorie ' jumbo honey bun			2
' there was only one left in the machine , suggesting that it 's among the most popular offerings			0
the pastry packs 17 grams of saturated fat , 360 milligrams of sodium and 30 grams of sugar			0
but either way , a single honey bun would put a hungry deadline - driven journalist on mrs. @entity0 's ' naughty ' list			1
the @entity72 brand pastry sells for $ 1.50 and is made by @entity73 , which also manufactures @entity73 breads and @entity76 snacks			2
other @entity78 snacks available in the @entity8 press snack machine this week included ' chocolate frosted creme cakes , ' ' rich frosted mini donuts ' and ' double chocolate cupcakes			1
' one member of the @entity8 daily print press pool told @entity86 with his best @entity89 ' @entity88 ' accent that ' the @entity90 can take our weekends , and they can take our holidays – but they ca n't take away our gargantuan glazed donuts ! ' the journalist begged to not be identified , and @entity86 obliged			1
the new normal : vending machines in @entity98 schools are now mostly chock full of healthier but less popular options the first lady made herself a national emblem of healthier eating in 2010 with a legislative push for more fruit , vegetables and whole grains in school meals , along with less sodium , sugar and fat			0
school nutritionists and foodservice workers , and their unions , hailed the law 's passage but have since turned on mrs. @entity0 , saying her caloric inflexibility has sparked a dramatic downturn in lunch sales			1
many school districts , they say , are now losing money on food instead of turning a profit that pays for books , computers and football - field scoreboards			2
mrs. @entity0 said in july that she would ' fight until the bitter end to make sure that every kid in this country continues to have the best nutrition that they can have			2
' but for now , at least , she 's leaving the journalists who will help frame the president 's legacy alone			0
and that , said @entity86 's cheeky @entity136 impersonator from the @entity8 press corps , is in the @entity0 administration 's best interest			1
' if they started rationing sugar and fat around here , ' he grimaced , ' you 'd have a lot of sluggish people in the briefing room when the 1:00 briefing starts			0
you do n't want cranky , hungry reporters peppering you with questions			0
of course , he added , ' we 'd probably just double our coffee intake			0
or open a bodega on the @entity156			0
' best option for @entity8 correspondents if the snack machine should go the way of the ashtray ? the black market , one reporter chuckles			0

*decadent* , gooey $ 1.50 treat also packs *30g* of sugars and 360mg of sodium
one reporter who covers the president said in his best ' @entity88 ' accent that ' the @entity90 can take our weekends , and they can take our holidays – but they ca n't take away our gargantuan glazed donuts ! '
@entity86 has seen other tasty snacks in the @entity8 press room vending machine from the same manufacturer
other junk food available to journalists who cover the administration include ' chocolate frosted creme cakes , ' ' rich frosted mini donuts ' and ' double chocolate cupcakes '
@entity8 press corps gets few perks but has been spared from mrs. @entity0 's *legendary* calorie - *cutting* spree
school districts have pulled first - lady - *approved* menus in several states because children are n't *buying* the food
