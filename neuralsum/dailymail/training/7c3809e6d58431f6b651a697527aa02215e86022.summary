by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 is as positive a character as you might wish to find around the @entity5 camp , so even when his @entity6 appeared to be in jeopardy he still clung to hope			1
in the sterile surroundings of a @entity10 medical centre last week @entity1 submitted to the medical scan on his injured knee that would tell him if his @entity6 was over and crossed his fingers — literally			1
‘ i actually sat in the scanner with the fingers crossed on both my hands for the whole 25 minutes , ’ said @entity1			1
all smiles : @entity1 ( left ) is positive that he 'll be fit to play a part for @entity5 at the @entity6 ‘ at the end i could n’t feel my fingers			1
after i came out our doctor saw the scan results and was pretty happy with them , considering what they ’d feared			2
they ’d thought it could have been a lot worse than it was			2
i was obviously a bit worried			2
’ with good reason : the collision with @entity35 ’s @entity34 in @entity5 ’s penultimate warm - up game looked bad , as the @entity38 man winced with pain and crumpled to the floor			1
he added : ‘ in the next 10 seconds you try to figure out how painful it is , and how bad it could be			0
‘ you get up straight away to try to walk it off , and if you ca n’t walk it off you panic a bit more			0
on the mend : @entity1 ( right ) is recovering from a knee injury sustained against @entity35 ‘ but i walked off the pitch — that was obviously a positive step — and , from my previous experience with my knee , i could gauge it was n’t as bad as that in the dressing room			1
i just kept my fingers crossed and tried to keep positive about it			2
‘ straight after , i sat in the dressing room and i was thinking , “ you ca n’t get yourself in a pickle and get yourself down , because the situation is not going to change			0
what ’s happened has happened ”			0
‘ you can either stay positive and look forward and look how you are going to get over it or you do the opposite and get yourself down			2
and that is not going to get you anywhere			0
’ @entity65 hit : @entity1 ( right ) was fouled hard by @entity35 's @entity34 ( bottom ) in june 's friendly eleven days on he is now out - running the physios overseeing his rehabilitation and hopes to be available to play against @entity69 — although you can see @entity5 manager @entity70 holding him back for the @entity72 game			1
‘ we are not sure about timescales but we are hopeful that @entity69 would be realistic , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ there is nothing set in stone and i ca n’t say whether i will definitely be back or not			0
we just know we are very positive about it and we are going to keep pushing towards it			2
’ he was playing so well against @entity35 , especially given the fact that much of his @entity38 season was disrupted by a knee injury and then a groin strain , that you would imagine he will get his chance when he is back			1
as such he is now embracing everything the @entity6 has to offer , the opening match between @entity87 and @entity88 having made quite an impression			1
shattered dreams : @entity1 ( bottom ) feared his @entity6 could be over after @entity34 's challenge ‘ it started off in fine fashion with the @entity97 national anthem , ’ he said			1
‘ that is where i really saw them going for it			0
the @entity97 singing the anthem really hit home			2
‘ usually you have the @entity97 down to be cool calm customers but they were really passionate about it			0
you could see how much it meant to them and the whole nation			0
when you are in the mix of it here , it really brings it alive			0
’ put @entity1 down as a singer rather than a mumbler when he does get the chance to line up for the anthems			1
it will be fitting if he does get to play , for it was his performance last summer when he came on against @entity87 in the @entity116 that marked him down as potential game - changer in this tournament			1
encouraging : @entity1 ( left ) says walking off the pitch was a positive sign for his knee injury ‘ it ’s a nice memory for me to cling to for the rest of my life , ’ he said , recalling his goal and 30 - minute appearance that changed the game			1
‘ let ’s hope there are more memories like that			0
having that taste last year , and being able to score against @entity87 in the @entity116 , and now being in the @entity6 with a chance to emulate that , it ’s a massive motivation			1
i took that coming into this tournament and i still have that same thought in my head now			0
’ in playing at the @entity116 , he followed in the footsteps of his father , @entity139			0
the former @entity5 , @entity140 and @entity142 winger played in the 2 - 0 friendly win in 1984 and plans to come out to watch his son if @entity5 progress			1
however , @entity1 has already outstripped him in terms of @entity5 caps — 15 so far to his father ’s eight — and playing at the @entity6 would also be something his father never achieved			1
golden moment : @entity1 scored @entity5 's second goal in their 2 - 2 draw vs @entity87 in june last year as for the intensity and pressure that will surround a @entity6 match , he is remarkably matter of fact			1
‘ it ’s a game of football is n’t it ? ’ he deadpanned			0
when pressed , he conceded : ‘ well , it ’s a big game of football ; just more people watch it ! it does n’t change the game and how you approach it			0
‘ i will try to do the same things i always do			0
because it is a @entity6 , it ’s on a bigger scale and more people watch it , so that gives you the extra motivation and buzz			2
on point : @entity1 said @entity87 's 3 - 1 opening @entity6 win against @entity88 made a mark on him ‘ it is what you watch as a kid growing up ; it is what everyone back home is watching , everyone here and everyone around the world			1
it is just on a bigger stage			0
’ @entity1 ’s versatility also gives him increased hope of caps here , given that he can play central midfield as well as wide			1
‘ when i play in midfield and have a good game , that ’s my favourite position ; then i play out wide and score a goal , that ’s my favourite position ; and when i played in goal at @entity204 i realised that ’s not my best position … ’ he said , offering the last phrase with a wry smile			2
mistaken identity : @entity208 ( left ) was wrongly dismissed by @entity209 in @entity38 's 6 - 0 loss at @entity211 he is , of course , referring to the debacle of his handball against @entity211 in @entity38 ’s 6 - 0 defeat			1
it gave @entity211 their third goal from a penalty and saw his team - mate @entity208 sent off in error , even though @entity1 told referee @entity209 that he was to blame			1
for now , despite his injury , he seems to be enjoying every aspect of this experience , except when he has to defer to @entity224 at snooker			2
@entity1 is , it appears , a bad loser			2
he revealed : ‘ i lost to him at snooker the other day			0
i was on the black ball and i potted the white , it was unbelievable			0
it would have been the best comeback of my life			0
i stormed off to my room			0
’ so how did @entity224 react ? ‘ @entity224 was laughing , as always , ’ he said .			0

@entity1 is positive he 'll play in the @entity6
midfielder is currently recovering from a knee injury
@entity1 was injured in @entity5 's 2 - 2 friendly vs @entity35
20 - year - old is hoping to feature against @entity69 on june 19
@entity38 star says hearing @entity87 sing the national anthem made the reality of the @entity6 sink in for *hm*
