you would expect to find plastic in your lunchbox , not on @entity4 ’s distant @entity3			1
but that 's exactly where @entity6 has found an ingredient of plastic - the first time the chemical has been detected on another world			0
the @entity12 spacecraft found small amounts of propylene , a chemical used to make storage containers on @entity17 , in the atmosphere of @entity4 's largest moon @entity3			1
the moon has a radius of about 1,600 miles , is bigger than planet @entity26 and is the second - largest moon in the solar system @entity3 is among the few bodies in the solar system with a significant atmosphere made up of hydrocarbons			2
the discovery could help us better understand how chemistry works on @entity3 , which many scientists regard as similar to how chemistry operated on ancient @entity17 before oxygen became significant ingredient			1
the small amount of propylene was identified in @entity3 's lower atmosphere by @entity12 's @entity44 ( @entity45 )			1
it is only present in a few parts per billion , and scientists would need to chain together the molecules to mould it into polypropylene plastic			0
@entity3 is @entity4 's largest moon - with a radius of about 1,600 miles ( 2,574 kilometers ) , it 's bigger than planet @entity26 - and is the second - largest moon in the solar system			2
the atmosphere of @entity3 is largely composed of nitrogen ; minor components lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and nitrogen - rich organic smog			2
the climate - including wind and rain - creates surface features similar to those of @entity17 , such as dunes , rivers , lakes and seas ( probably of liquid methane and ethane ) , and deltas , and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on @entity17			1
@entity45 measured the infrared light , or heat radiation , emitted from @entity4 and its moons in much the same way our hands feel the warmth of a fire			0
by isolating the same signal at various altitudes within the lower atmosphere , researchers identified the chemical with what they claim to be ‘ a high degree of confidence ’			2
‘ this chemical is all around us in everyday life , strung together in long chains to form a plastic called polypropylene , ’ said @entity92 , a planetary scientist at @entity6 's @entity93			0
‘ that plastic container at the grocery store with the recycling code 5 on the bottom - that 's polypropylene			0
’ the voyager spacecraft had previously found propane , the heaviest member of the three - carbon family , and propyne , one of the lightest members			0
but the middle chemicals , one of which is propylene , were missing the detection of the chemical fills in a mysterious gap in @entity3 observations that dates back to @entity6 's @entity120 spacecraft and the first - ever close flyby of this moon in 1980			1
@entity120 identified many of the gases in @entity3 's brownish atmosphere as hydrocarbons , the chemicals that primarily make up petroleum and other fossil fuels on @entity17			1
it detected all members of the one - and two - carbon families in @entity3 's atmosphere			0
from the three - carbon family , the spacecraft found propane , the heaviest member , and propyne , one of the lightest members			0
but the middle chemicals , one of which is propylene , were missing			0
it was finally found as a result of more detailed analysis of the @entity45 data			0
@entity12 's mass spectrometer , a device that looks at the composition of @entity3 's atmosphere , had hinted earlier that propylene might be present in the upper atmosphere ‘ this measurement was very difficult to make because propylene 's weak signature is crowded by related chemicals with much stronger signals , ’ said @entity150 , @entity151 scientist and principal investigator for @entity45			1
‘ this success boosts our confidence that we will find still more chemicals long hidden in @entity3 's atmosphere			1
’ @entity12 's mass spectrometer , a device that looks at the composition of @entity3 's atmosphere , had hinted earlier that propylene might be present in the upper atmosphere			2
however , a positive identification had not been made			0
‘ this new piece of the puzzle will provide an additional test of how well we understand the chemical zoo that makes up @entity3 's atmosphere , ’ said @entity165 , @entity12 's deputy project scientist at @entity6 ’s @entity166 .			1

@entity173 could help us better understand how chemistry works on @entity3
scientists claim this is similar to how chemistry operated on ancient @entity17
probes had previously failed to identify propylene because its chemical signature was overshadowed by other , much stronger , chemicals
