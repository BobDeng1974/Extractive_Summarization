by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 started the week as @entity1 's most admired politician , according to a @entity5 poll			2
he will finish it either as an electoral has - been , or as a @entity8 presidential front - runner with a reinforced reputation for integrity and a no - nonsense management style			1
or in other words , @entity8 observers suggest , everything president @entity14 and former secretary of state @entity17 lack			1
' @entity2 showed some balls in firing his deputy chief of staff and his campaign manager , ' a @entity8 election consultant told @entity22 , referring to long - time @entity2 confidantes @entity24 and @entity25			1
' we 're still waiting for @entity14 to fire someone over the @entity31 tea - party scandal , ' he said			1
and the @entity34 's habit of snooping on reporters			0
' @entity36 , a conservative group , drew much the same conclusion – although its members say @entity2 's positions on immigration and other hot - button issues place him closer to the political center than they 'd like a president to be			1
@entity45 : @entity46 governor @entity2 , pictured thursday , offered dozens of apologies for his staff 's behavior , but not before firing two of his closest advisers -- a move that could endear him to @entity8 accustomed to seeing government officials misbehave without consequences heads wo n't roll : @entity8 strategists contrast @entity2 's willingness to fire dishonest underlings with president @entity14 and @entity17 's habit of protecting their staffers accused of misconduct sticking around : conservatives called on president @entity14 to sack @entity65 after his @entity34 was caught snooping on journalists in 2013 , but the @entity1 attorney general is still in his cabinet - level job ' abuse of power by government officials is wrong , whether it 's closing lanes in @entity74 , using the @entity31 to target political opponents , or waiving the law regarding @entity77 , ' the right - wing group 's national coordinator , @entity69 , said in a statement			1
' today , gov. @entity2 held some subordinates accountable			0
@entity80 will tell whether this is enough			0
we 're still waiting for president @entity14 to hold anyone accountable			1
' while many @entity8 see @entity14 and @entity88 as political bullies , @entity83 loyal to the governor with a personality to match their state 's more enduring stereotypes bristle when they hear that label applied to their man			1
' i am who i am , but i am not a bully , ' he told reporters on thursday , as he announced that his axe had fallen on the necks of two long - time members of his inner circle			0
' politics ai n't bean bag , ok ? and everybody in the country who engages in politics knows that			0
on the other hand , that 's very , very different than saying that , you know , someone 's a bully			0
... i am not a focus - group tested , blow - dried candidate or @entity114 , that has always made some people , as you know , uneasy			0
some people like that style , some people do n't			0
' if @entity2 survives the ' @entity123 ' scandal , sparked by his aides ' use of the @entity127 on - ramps to punish a political adversary with unrelenting car traffic , he could face @entity17 in a 2016 presidential contest			1
that , said a veteran @entity8 fundraiser , would set up a favorable comparison for the @entity46 governor			0
resigned : @entity136 official @entity135 left his job in december after the ' bridgegate ' scandal began to heat up			0
he refused to testify in a state assembly hearing on thursday , earning a contempt citation from lawmakers @entity31 official @entity142 took the @entity143 before @entity144 in a hearing about politically targeting right - wing groups , but she kept her job -- and her pension once she ' retired ' -- in the @entity14 administration ' can you imagine @entity17 coming to the press and saying she fired the @entity153 employees who doctored the @entity154 's @entity32 talking points ? and apologizing publicly ? i ca n't , ' he said			1
canned : @entity2 deputy chief of staff @entity24 got the axe , the governor said , for lying to him about a plot to snarl traffic in the town of @entity74 as revenge against the mayor ' this whole thing will help him in the long run , not hurt him , ' said the operative , who once raised money for the ill - fated campaign of @entity88 's 2000 @entity172 challenger , @entity171			2
' after eight years of president @entity14 , this guy is a breath of fresh air			1
even the tea partiers have to recognize that			2
' and firing two of his closest advisers could be a move that endears him to republicans accustomed to seeing government officials misbehave without consequences @entity2 himself was all apologies on thursday , offering his mea culpas more than 30 times during a 90 - minute press conference			2
turning a @entity46 town 's streets into a parking lot as part of a political vendetta , he admitted , ' was an awful , callous , indifferent thing to do			0
... and that 's why i apologized to the people of @entity46 today and why i apologized specifically to the people of @entity74 who were inconvenienced over those four @entity201 's not right , and that 's why i 'm here apologizing			0
' diagnoses of @entity2 's political future have been decidedly mixed as his administration becomes more and more weighed down by the controversy			1
one @entity210 reporter 's analysis concluded that ' the timing of the blossoming scandal is dreadful ' for @entity2 , ' disrupting a highly anticipated plan to present the popular governor to the national electorate as a no - nonsense , bipartisan balm to a deeply divided federal government			1
' and @entity219 reporter @entity218 opined thursday morning that that @entity2 's credibility and his reputation as a bipartisan solution - seeker will be unrecoverable after the dust settles			1
' if the @entity2 administration sought to punish a @entity226 for being uncooperative , it necessarily becomes harder for @entity2 to paint a rosy picture about his relationship with @entity229 , ' he wrote			2
hours later , @entity218 tweeted that ' the early reax [ reaction ] among the @entity8 consultant class ' has been that ' @entity2 did well today ( on balance ) ... but his story had damn well better hold up			2
' @entity46 state democratic chairman @entity235 hinted that @entity2 is n't yet out of the woods			2
' i suggest the governor try a new approach when answering questions : honesty , ' he told reporters			0
but behind the scenes , republicans are betting that @entity2 will weather the storm			2
some are suggesting the episode will give @entity1 who do n't live in @entity46 someone to root for			0
@entity25 ( @entity249 ) was thursday 's second ' bridgegate ' casualty			0
the former @entity2 campaign manager lost a chance to chair the @entity254 and a lucrative contract with the @entity2 - led @entity256 bridge to nowhere : @entity74 mayor @entity257 is suddenly a household name after @entity2 aides turned his town 's @entity127 on - ramps into a giant traffic bottleneck as a form of retribution for not endorsing their boss ' a state issue ' : the @entity267 said thursday that it wo n't weigh in on gov. @entity2 's brewing troubles , but that line may change once the presidential season begins ' it 's not too often that @entity1 get a sense of how politicians will react to a gut - check moment before they have a chance to vote for them , ' said a @entity8 pollster who asked not to be identified			1
' for @entity1 in 49 states , that 's what 's happening right now			0
and my own gut tells me that they 're going to like it			0
' @entity284 , the long - time @entity229 strategist and @entity14 adviser , told the @entity286 that @entity2 is far from mortally wounded			1
' if he deals firmly with the offender , and the trail does n’t lead directly back to him , my bet is that this will be a , well , bump in the road			0
@entity2 's biggest problem , though , is still the split within the @entity8			1
moderates like him , as do liberal - leaning @entity1 who vote @entity8 – usually on the basis of a single discordant issue like abortion			2
but the party 's most conservative members still treat him with suspicion			0
the popular conservative @entity302 blog mocked @entity2 for a ' @entity304 - like apology of “ i knew nothing , ” ' referring to the bumbling guard on the 1960s - era show @entity307			1
' @entity14 said the same thing about the @entity31 targeting tea partiers , of course , ' one of the site 's leaders wrote			1
' to which conservatives replied : that ’s no excuse			0

how damaged is @entity2 ? maybe not at all , say some @entity8 *insiders*
while tea partiers have little *patience* for the sometimes - conservative @entity2 , republicans in general may see his candor as a breath of fresh air
conservatives draw comparisons to president @entity14 , who they say has refused to fire several underlings following their dishonesty in office
@entity17 , a likely @entity229 presidential front - runner , also *dodged* *responsibility* for @entity153 messes including @entity32 , they say
while @entity2 's reputation as a bully wo n't win him liberal converts , his hard - nosed , no - nonsense approach is *attractive* to many @entity8
any advantage he takes from his ' bridgegate ' *mop* - up effort would *vanish* , however , if it 's proven that he knew about the scandal and did nothing
