@entity0 are ready to blow @entity1 out of the water in the battle to sign @entity4 with a £ 30million - plus bid for the unsettled @entity7 defender at the end of the season			1
with @entity10 insisting he will remain with @entity12 next season , @entity1 have been alerted to @entity4 's possible availability and are believed to have enquired about him			1
the 25 - year old , who can operate as a midfield anchor man or centre half , has become increasingly disillusioned with a lack of starting opportunities under @entity19 and is seriously thinking about leaving the @entity20			0
@entity4 is viewed as a @entity0 - style centre back , with his natural defensive instincts supplemented by an ability on the ball that allows him to function so effectively in midfield			0
they will not hesitate to meet a £ 30m - plus valuation @entity7 will demand , should the @entity46 champions reluctantly decide they can not stand in his way after seeing him slip down the pecking order since @entity19 succeeded @entity51			1
on the run : @entity4 is viewed as a @entity0 - style centre - back - and it is understood the @entity56 club will not hesitate to meet the £ 30million - plus asking price while the @entity59 defender was a regular pick under @entity51 , following a £ 32m move from @entity62 in august 2012 , he has struggled to force his way into @entity19 's starting line - up and was overlooked for both legs of @entity7 's @entity66 semi-final against @entity67			2
it is thought he would prefer the @entity36 as his next destination , which would leave @entity70 pondering whether to try and convince @entity10 he is up to the task of reinforcing @entity1 's midfield			0
it may not easy for the @entity75 manager , after @entity10 recently delivered a blunt analysis of his form in the @entity46 this season and admitted he was ' not yet ready to take command of a really big @entity81 club			0

@entity4 is set to leave @entity7 at the end of the season
@entity0 and @entity1 are both interested in the £ 30m - rated defender
the 25 - year - old has become disillusioned with life at @entity7
@entity10 is *poised* to stay with @entity12 next season
