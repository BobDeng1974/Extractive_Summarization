@entity0 was excited on wednesday afternoon , and understandably so			1
@entity2 ’s sporting director believed he was about to be reunited with his old friend @entity3			1
@entity0 had followed @entity3 from @entity4 to @entity5 , and now @entity6 seemed set to offer an opportunity for the two men to work together again , recreating a partnership that had proved successful on the pitch during their tenure in @entity12			1
but after @entity2 learned of the evidence of alleged racism , sexism and homophobia that had been passed to the @entity19 by @entity5 ’s lawyers , @entity3 ’s chances of succeeding @entity14 disappeared			1
and by thursday lunchtime @entity0 had resigned , with @entity2 issuing a short , sharp statement			1
investigated : @entity3 ( right ) and @entity0 have been accused of being racist , sexist and homophobic in a series of text messages dating back to their time together at @entity5 @entity27 's story that shook football @entity3 issued an apology on thursday night for his part in the text and email exchanges that have shocked football to its core			1
but the statement seems unlikely to draw a line under the affair			0
@entity3 ’s apology , issued by the @entity39 , prompted an angry response because of the use of the phrase ‘ friendly text message banter ’			1
judging from the noises emanating from the @entity19 on thursday , the pair seem likely to receive further censure			1
football ’s governing body failed to act against @entity50 chief executive @entity49 , who was engulfed by a sexist emails storm earlier this year , and the @entity52 campaigner and former footballer @entity53 , who was damaged by - but never charged over - his use of the n - word in a text			1
however , it is understood @entity49 and @entity53 were considered to have acted in private , while @entity0 and @entity3 ’s exchanges went to a much wider audience			1
sorry : @entity3 issued an apology on thursday for his part in the text and email exchanges the fact that the two men are out of work may not exempt them from punishment , either			1
if it is concluded that a fine and a ban are appropriate , such verdicts could be held in abeyance until one or both return to work			0
that , of course , could prove a serious problem if the two men end up receiving lengthy suspensions			0
it would be unprecedented in football to place a would - be manager or administrator in the position of having a ban hanging over him , even as he is trying to persuade clubs to employ him			0
the @entity19 investigation is now in full swing and @entity88 understands there could be further unsavoury evidence in text messages recovered by @entity5 ’s lawyers			1
until now the information passed to the @entity19 in two letters concerns only the texts detailed in @entity88 ’s exclusive report yesterday			1
@entity3 sent out confused messages on thursday			1
in the early evening , his agent told @entity99 that he was shocked by the events of the previous 24 hours and intimated that he would fight the allegations			0
later in the evening , he issued his apology through the @entity39			0
confused messages : @entity3 's agent told @entity99 that the former boss would fight the allegations before the @entity106 himself issued an apology through the @entity39 others were more forthright and challenged football ’s authorities to take a concerted stance against bigotry			1
the chairman of @entity52 , @entity113 , called for the ‘ appropriate action ’ to be taken			0
‘ these revelations are further confirmation of how football is tainted with racism , sexism , homophobia and anti-semitism , and the culture which continues to exist throughout the game and in wider society , ’ he said			2
‘ the reality is that these views are most dangerously held by those people in positions of power , and the football establishment knows and condones it			0
‘ what you see at face value is not always reflective of the attitudes which are actually held deep down			0
it ’s easy to present yourself as being reasonable and fair , and to behave in ways that hide prejudice and bias			0
however , any in - depth analysis of hidden views would be likely to reveal otherwise			0
that is what makes it difficult to eradicate such prejudices , bigotry and even hatred			0
exclusive : chief sports reporter @entity27 's story in thursday 's @entity149 @entity150 : @entity88 broke the story of @entity3 and @entity0 's text message exchanges ‘ this familiar scenario acts as a challenge to the leadership of football that can not be shirked again			1
the governing bodies and the clubs must denounce such attitudes prevalent in the game , and take the appropriate action			2
‘ if these types of exchanges made privately make it into the public eye , the individuals concerned must accept the full consequences			2
’ his views were echoed by former professional @entity170 , who has written on these pages			0
‘ the truth is , nothing in the transcripts of the alleged exchanges surprised me , ’ he said			0
‘ in my mind this is how football talks in private , and more importantly , it is how it behaves in public			0
’ unsurprised : former @entity50 striker @entity170 said he was n't shocked by the alleged exchange @entity185 , the agent who was the subject of @entity187 in one of the texts , was deeply offended			0
‘ to say it ’s good to see a @entity191 suffer , that ’s not good , ’ he said			0
@entity193 might have made uncomfortable reading for @entity3 yesterday			1
one player who served under him at @entity5 , @entity196 , responded to the @entity88 report by posting a number of tweets before then deleting them			1
he suggested he has experience of the unsavoury side of @entity3 , adding : ‘ wish the people at @entity5 had seen it sooner			2
’ @entity205 said : ‘ @entity3 always use to call me a wee @entity206 and laugh his head off			2
no one knows what happens behind the scenes in football clubs			0
at the time when you ’re a young pro , no one will listen			0
so i chose to keep my mouth shut			0
’ a further tweet said : ‘ @entity220 away a young @entity219 boy was at the gates and @entity3 shouted look it ’s @entity224 ’s brother			2
’ fans ' favourite : @entity3 was hugely popular at @entity5 and there was outrage when he was axed by @entity229 he then claimed @entity3 started laughing with his coaching staff and added : ‘ i ’m not @entity206			2
i ’m @entity231 and my parents are from @entity219 ’			0
@entity205 , a 22 - year - old now playing at @entity233 , was unavailable for further comment yesterday , while @entity5 also refused to comment on his claims			0
@entity3 ’s apology was calculated to distance himself from some of the most odious remarks in the text scandal , and to start the rehabilitation of a man who has achieved so much as a footballer and a manager			2
however , the @entity19 mood music on thursday night suggested they are ready to tackle the affair head on			2
it may be a long time before either @entity3 or @entity0 , two men who have become pariahs over the past days , are able to again work in an industry that has offered opportunity and riches to young men regardless of their background			1
the @entity39 wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during @entity3 ’s time at @entity5			2
in the course of a search by the @entity263 in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during mr @entity3 ’s employment at @entity5 , in relation to other matters , it emerged that @entity270 had , it seems , sent a couple of one line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures			1
these were two text messages sent in private at a time @entity3 felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter			1
that said , @entity3 believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions			2
the precise details need to remain private for the time being until any @entity19 process is complete			2
the @entity39 does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees , like @entity270 , working under great pressure in highly charged situations			0
if @entity3 has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would , however , wish to sincerely apologise			2
@entity3 finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the @entity19 and in the media now , 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of @entity2			1
@entity270 is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media			0
it has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so			1
further , there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of @entity270 ’s involvement in this matter			0
@entity3 looks forward to matters being put straight in due course , following any investigation of this matter			1
@entity270 can not of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others			0
@entity3 has said that he will be fully co-operating with any @entity19 investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter .			1
