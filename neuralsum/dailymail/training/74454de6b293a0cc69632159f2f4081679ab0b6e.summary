elected police chief @entity15 hit out after @entity16 took nearly 20 hours to tell locals that @entity1 had absconded from @entity5 open prison near @entity6			1
@entity1 , 49 , originally of @entity18 , north @entity19 , was serving an eight - year jail sentence for twice slashing the face of a 15 - year - old @entity23 boy in @entity24 , east @entity19 , in november 2010			1
he failed to return to the notoriously insecure open prison - which has been dubbed @entity26 by inmates - by 3.30pm on tuesday after being given leave to go to @entity19 last friday			1
police were informed the prisoner was missing from the jail at about 5.30pm on tuesday but only told the public and media at 12.55pm on wednesday			2
suffolk police and crime commissioner mr @entity15 said he would be challenging @entity7 chief constable @entity34 about the embarrassing blunder			1
he said : ' i was given an assurance by the deputy chief constable last july that communications to the public in these situations would be reviewed			2
' clearly this is not working and that is completely unsatisfactory			0
' i will now take this up with the chief constable again and seek a cast - iron guarantee that such public information is released without delay			2
' my understanding is that the information was not released for 19 hours and this does not help maintain public trust and confidence in the criminal justice system			2
' @entity57 twice slashed a teenager 's face before launching a racist tirade , his 2011 sentencing hearing at @entity56 , east @entity19 , heard			0
@entity57 and his accomplice @entity61 , 26 , ambushed the teenager from behind on november 21 , 2010 and punched him in the face and kicked him before the boy 's mobile phone was taken			0
@entity1 knocked the boy to the ground and pinned him down before slicing open his cheek in the terrifying late - night attack			1
it is the second escape from @entity5 open prison - which has been dubbed @entity26 by inmates - in two years the pair tried to flee but were arrested just yards away after a passer - by heard the boy 's screams			1
they admitted robbery and causing grievous bodily harm , but claimed they were drunk at the time			0
@entity61 , from east @entity19 , was jailed for seven years			0
commenting on @entity85 's escape , a @entity16 spokesman said yesterday : ' @entity16 were contacted by @entity5 just after 5.30pm yesterday ( @entity86 ) reporting that @entity1 had failed to return to the prison			1
' overnight we carried out initial enquiries including liaising with other forces to check known addresses			0
suffolk police and crime commissioner @entity15 has slammed the county 's police over 20 - hour delays to warning the public @entity85 was on the loose ' we were not able to locate @entity85 and therefore a media appeal was requested this morning			1
the safety of the public is our priority at all times and is our first consideration			0
' the spokesman said @entity57 should not be approached and appealed for anyone who knows his whereabouts to contact them			0
the latest escape in @entity7 comes after it took the county 's police nearly 20 hours to warn residents that kidnapper @entity109 was at large after he disappeared from @entity5 last july			1
best , 25 , had been described by a judge as a ' danger to society ' after abducting his ex-girlfriend in @entity6 in 2007			0
he failed to attend a roll call at @entity5 on july 5			1
police were notified at 8pm , but only put out an appeal to find @entity109 just after 3.30pm the following day			2
@entity109 was later recaptured after a meeting with the chief and deputy constables , mr @entity15 said at the time : ' @entity122 accepts that the information could have been released at an earlier stage - and , as a result , we will be reviewing our processes			0
' deputy chief constable @entity128 said then : ' in this particular case , an assessment carried out after liaising with the prison service concluded that the risk to the public from @entity109 is low			2
' at the same time , there were a number of sensitive inquiries which needed to be carried out as a priority			0
' in october 2011 , the police force delayed warning the public that three violent criminals had escaped from a secure hospital in @entity7			1
it took officers 11 hours to put out a warning that @entity145 , 21 , @entity146 , 22 , and @entity147 , 21,had escaped from @entity148 in @entity149 , near @entity150			0
the trio were all recaptured after a huge search .			0

violent @entity1 failed to return to @entity5 open prison
but despite his criminal past , police took a day to warn the public
the area 's crime commissioner has slammed the force over the delays
