by @entity0 published : 04:58 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 05:08 est , 31 july 2012 @entity3 cost - cutter @entity1 wants to widen its doors in yet another scheme to make themselves cash			1
the @entity9 - based airline says allowing people to get on or off in twos could boost their profits as it would speed - up their turnaround at airports			1
@entity1 's outspoken boss @entity16 is famous for his cost - cutting ideas , including charging £ 1 to use the toilet or even offering standing tickets on flights			1
now mr @entity16 is in talks with a @entity23 company to help him herd passengers on and off in record times			1
good things come in twos : @entity1 wants to get people on and off quicker by widening its doors the state - owned @entity29 is already considering putting a prototype together for them			1
' the @entity23 are willing to listen to what we want , ' @entity1 ’s chief financial officer , @entity1 said			1
full of ideas : @entity1 's boss @entity16 has considered many extrovert plans to make more money ' a plane manufactured by @entity40 or @entity41 is a one - size - fits - all			1
we want two people to walk through the door			0
' it came as last night @entity1 boss @entity45 said he was upset he could not charge more for tickets , as profits fell by almost a third			1
' we ’re always trying to increase fares , but this time demand does n’t allow it , ' he said			0
he added that austerity and @entity54 economic woes would ‘ restrain fare growth ’ going into next winter			0
lower demand for air travel by hard - pressed passengers was also keeping prices down , he said			0
he blamed the 28 per cent fall in underlying pre-tax profits to £ 88million on the rising costs of aircraft fuel			2
the amount the company pays for its fuel has risen by 27 per cent in the last year , he said , and now makes up almost half of total operating costs			0
but it transpired that the airline had locked itself into paying a higher price for the fuel , after striking a deal			0
@entity1 boss @entity16 's plan for wider doors is the latest scheme from the budget airline			1
some have been implemented , while others have not			0
they include ... last year it paid the equivalent of $ 82 a barrel for the fuel , but this year is shelling out between $ 100 and $ 104 – more than it would be paying on the open market			0
the deal means @entity1 will pay out the higher amount until march next year , but @entity45 said it was worth it for the certainty on costs			2
profits between april and june fell by 28 per cent to £ 88million , while passenger numbers increased by 6 per cent to 22.5million			2
revenues , which rose 11 per cent to £ 1billion , were held back by ‘ heavily discounted fares ’ from some of @entity1 ’s regional @entity95 airports and a number of its continental destinations			2
but the airline has often been accused of adding on additional and hidden charges in the past			0
@entity45 said the summer ’s trading was still poor , with @entity54 being put off by high prices and many brits choosing to stay at home to watch the @entity105			0
he refused to comment on @entity1 ’s offer for @entity107 , which is currently being assessed by @entity54 competition authorities			2
shares , which are up 25 per cent in the last 12 months , rose 8.8c to close at € 4			0
a turbulent ride : @entity1 profits between april and june declined by 28 per cent to £ 88million			1

getting people off and on in twos will speed up airport turnarounds - *key* for budget airlines ' profits
