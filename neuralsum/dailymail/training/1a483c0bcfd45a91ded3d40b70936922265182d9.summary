@entity1 's summer target @entity2 has aggravated his troublesome knee whilst on international duty for @entity5			1
the @entity7 star had to quit a routine training session in @entity9 , where @entity5 face @entity10 and @entity11 in friendlies , but is set to have a series of tests before returning to @entity15			1
@entity2 was heavily linked with a move to @entity17 throughout the summer , but nothing materialised despite a series of negotiations between the clubs			2
@entity1 manager @entity32 is an admirer of @entity2 but was hesitant to fork out a significant fee , with question marks surrounding the player 's fitness			2
instead , @entity1 paid a @entity39 record fee of Â£ 60million for @entity40			0
these concerns could be justified as @entity2 might have to go back for more surgery in an attempt to alleviate the niggling problem			0
if so , the @entity45 will be on the sidelines for a considerable amount of time			0
new @entity7 manager @entity22 will be frustrated by the revelations as he is trying to cope without talismanic playmaker @entity50 , who is out until october			0
@entity52 force : the @entity5 midfielder was a top summer transfer target of @entity1 passionate : @entity2 played with plenty of endeavour at the @entity31 but lacked full fitness after knee surgery like our @entity1 facebook page			1
surgery again ? the 27 - year - old could be set for another go under the knife to alleviate a knee problem			1

27 - year - old was linked with a move to @entity17 throughout the summer
@entity7 star pulled out of training with @entity5 after aggravating knee
@entity2 had surgery on troublesome knee towards the end of last season and *struggled* to reach full fitness in time for the @entity31
