@entity0 is set to return for @entity1 against @entity2 on saturday after taking a full part in training for the first time since suffering concussion against @entity7 three weeks ago			1
@entity1 ’s first - choice full back was knocked unconscious in the early stages of his side ’s 47 - 17 victory over the @entity7 and missed last sunday ’s 19 - 9 loss by @entity14 in @entity15 , where @entity17 ’ @entity16 stood in			1
@entity0 suffered a setback in his recovery last week when he experienced headache - like symptoms after beginning return - to - play protocols			2
@entity0 has been suffering from concussion and missed @entity1 's defeat in @entity14 last week @entity0 was knocked out while tackling @entity7 's @entity24 at @entity25 last month but he has since completed the six - day programme and participated in controlled contact training against @entity28 at @entity1 ’s @entity30 base on friday			1
‘ @entity0 took a full part in training and will be available for selection , ’ an @entity1 spokesman confirmed			1
@entity0 's return for his 36th cap would provide a significant boost for @entity38 , whose team were out - thought and outmuscled against @entity41 ’s championship favourites last week			1
@entity38 will also be able to call on @entity43 lock @entity42 after he completed his second game for @entity45 following the ankle surgery which saw him miss @entity1 ’s opening three @entity49 fixtures			2
@entity42 looks certain to win his 37th cap at @entity25 on saturday , meaning @entity51 or @entity52 will drop to the bench , leaving @entity55 ’s position under threat			0
@entity0 has returned to training in a much - needed boost to @entity1 boss @entity38 @entity16 in line to replace @entity60 if his calf problem persists @entity62 starts in the centre for @entity17 when they take on @entity65 at the @entity66 on sunday , where @entity16 starts at fly - half , and he could make his first start of the championship if @entity60 ’s calf problem persists			1
the @entity43 centre has started the first three games of @entity1 ’s campaign at @entity75 alongside @entity76 but suffered the leg injury in @entity15 and has been severely restricted in training			2
@entity79 played 80 minutes for @entity80 in their @entity81 draw with @entity43 but he has endured an up - and - down season and struggled badly off the bench against @entity14 , leaving the ever - reliable @entity62 in line for a place among the replacements at least			0
@entity43 flanker @entity86 could also return to the international fold after proving his fitness from the ankle injury he sustained in january , although @entity90 is likely to be retained at blindside , putting @entity93 ’s place on the bench in danger			0
out - of - favour scrum - half @entity95 scored a try for @entity98 as they beat @entity100 yesterday but is not expected to return as @entity101 and @entity102 fill the no 9 slots , while @entity104 will have to settle for a place on the bench again after being one of only two unused replacements in @entity15			0
loosehead prop @entity108 played 60 minutes for @entity45 yesterday but @entity109 and @entity110 are favourites to retain their places when @entity115 names his team to face the winless @entity116 on wednesday			0
@entity1 ’s players will reconvene at @entity118 before recommencing training on tuesday .			0
