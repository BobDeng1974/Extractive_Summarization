by @entity0 dryland ecosystems such as deserts play a more important role in the global carbon cycle than previously thought , research has revealed			1
and one of the biggest contributors , responsible for a huge spike in the amount of co2 absorbed in 2011 , is located in @entity11			1
the findings suggest that the @entity11 @entity13 , when exposed to increased rainfall and in turn grows more vegetation , could become a giant ' carbon sink ' and might even be a major driver for global carbon absorption			1
research suggests that the @entity11 savannah ( pictured ) played a major role in the global absorption of carbon in 2011			1
other vast carbon sinks in the @entity27 also had an effect , but @entity11 was said to be the major driver however , researchers warn it is not a complete solution to the problems caused by man - made climate change			1
@entity37 faculty member @entity36 and his collaborators explained their findings in the journal @entity41			2
@entity42 refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the @entity48 in the central and eastern @entity49 becomes hotter than usual			0
the average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and @entity52 ( approximately 2 and 5 ° f ) warmer than normal during this event			0
this has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere , ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the @entity49 and globally			0
strong @entity42 events occur every 20 years or so , but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming			0
at the opposite end of the scale , @entity68 is the climatological counterpart to @entity42			1
@entity68 refers to periods when sea - surface temperatures around the @entity48 are cooler than normal			1
this has a similar affect on air pressure and rainfall because it suppresses how much heat and moisture enters the atmosphere			0
they urged global ecologists to include the emerging role of dryland ecosystems in their research			2
' our study found that natural events in @entity11 were largely responsible for this anomaly , ' @entity36 said , referring to the spike in 2011			1
' @entity68 - driven rainfall during 2010 and 2011 , as well as the 30 - year greening up of its deserts and other drylands contributed to significant changes across the globe			1
' the team realised that the world 's land carbon sinks in 2011 seemed to be absorbing an unusually large amount of carbon , @entity36 said			2
carbon dioxide moves constantly between land , oceans , vegetation and the atmosphere			0
when one of those absorbs more carbon dioxide than it releases , it 's referred to as a carbon sink			2
@entity36 and his collaborators investigated the phenomena with a variety of data sets and modeling approaches			0
they eventually discovered surprising interactions between climate extremes and desert greening that increased in importance over the past 30 years			2
further study showed that the dryland systems in the @entity27 , specifically @entity11 , had particularly high productivity in response to increased @entity68 - phase rainfall			1
in particular , the sink in @entity11 would have been aided by the 2010 to 2011 @entity68			1
after years of drought , the huge amount of rain would have given the @entity11 savannah a boost in plant growth , and thus carbon absorption			1
@entity134 , co-author and senior scientist at the @entity136 in ( @entity137 ) , said the team was ' surprised ' that there was no evidence of a similar event occuring in the past 30 years			0
this suggested that the recent greening of drylands was responsible for some of the changes seen in carbon cycle dynamics			2
this world map shows global temperature anomalies in 2008 compared to the 1950 to 1980 baseline period			0
large areas of the central and eastern @entity49 were cooler than the long - term average , linked to a @entity68 episode that began in 2007 the authors discovered that certain ecosystems had become more sensitive to precipitation from 1982 to 1996 and 1997 to 2011			1
this seems to have been due to the greening of desert vegetation			0
the process led to a four-fold increase in net carbon uptake to precipitation over the past 30 years			0
' novel responses of the biosphere have been predicted to occur following human activities that have caused unprecedented changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations , climate and land cover , ' @entity36 continued			2
' our study provides new evidence that interactions among these human activities are now also impacting dryland biomes			0
' these findings have global implications that should be considered in monitoring networks and @entity182 system models			1
' but the large 2011 land carbon uptake is not expected to lead to long - term increases in ecosystem carbon accumulation , according to the researchers			0
' dryland systems have high rates of carbon turnover compared to other biomes , ' @entity134 said			0
' we can expect the carbon to be quickly respired or consumed in wildfires , already partly reflected by the high atmospheric carbon dioxide growth rate in 2012			0
' @entity36 and his colleagues will now be investigating the role of fire and invasive species in dryland systems to further understand the mechanisms for dryland greening and the consequences this will have on the carbon cycle .			2

new research suggests deserts could have a bigger role in climate change
and the scientists say the @entity11 savannah is a major driver
the study looked into what caused the 2011 @entity218 absorption spike
it was found to be the greening of drylands caused by @entity68
they say their findings should be included in models of @entity182 's climate
