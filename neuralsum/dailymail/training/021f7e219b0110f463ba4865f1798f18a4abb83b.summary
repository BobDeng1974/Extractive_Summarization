by @entity1 reporter published : 17:56 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 05:22 est , 18 july 2013 a small @entity3 town concerned over government surveillance practices see an answer in drone hunting licenses			1
@entity7 , @entity3 — population 500 — is considering a permit that would allow its freedom - minded citizens to shoot down @entity13 unmanned aircraft for cash rewards			1
the seven - member town board will soon vote on the measure it hopes will be a real money - maker			1
and though they see the licenses as a fun jab at the federal government , the resident who drafted ordinance is n’t laughing			1
not on my watch : @entity7 , @entity3 ( population 500 ) is mulling the idea of instituting a town - sanctioned drone hunting licenses			1
mayor @entity29 demonstrates what the hunting might look like ‘ to [ them ] , it ’s a novelty , ’ @entity32 , the man behind the idea told @entity34			0
‘ to me , i ’m serious			0
’ steel fears the country is becoming increasingly controlled by a government bent on controlling its citizens through surveillance and wants @entity7 to stand out as an exception			1
‘ we do not want drones in town , ’ said steel			1
‘ they fly in town , they get shot down			1
’ steel calls his ordinance ‘ very symbolic , ’ but its anything but a vague gesture			0
it was submitted complete with age restrictions , allowable ammunition types , and prescribed fee and reward amounts			0
as per the ordinance : ‘ @entity61 of @entity7 shall issue a reward of $ 100 to any shooter who presents a valid hunting license and the following identifiable parts of an unmanned aerial vehicle whose markings and configuration are consistent with those used on any similar craft known to be owned or operated by the @entity13 federal government			1
’ ' i 'm gon na shoot it down , ordinance or no ' : @entity32 drafted the ordinance and is serious about drone - hunting licenses even if some town boardspeople are n't quite convinced @entity81 's eye view ? an aerial shot of how a drone might see the town of 500 , though @entity32 admits he 's never seen one flying above @entity7 drone days : the small town has , until now , been mostly known for hosting the ' world 's first rodeo ' in 1896			1
now it may hold the world 's first drone hunt the licenses would cost $ 25 and shooters must be 21 or over			0
‘ the applicant , ’ reads the ordinance , ‘ must be able to read and understand @entity97			0
’ ‘ basically , i do not believe in the idea of a surveillance society and i believe we are headed that way , ’ explained steel			2
@entity32 acknowledged that destroying a @entity13 drone would be a federal offense			0
cash reward : shooting down a drone would constitute a federal offense			0
nonetheless , the ordinance even specifies bounty amounts of up to $ 100 he also admitted he ’s never actually seen a drone			0
‘ i ’m gon na shoot it down , ’ said the defiant steel			0
‘ ordinance or no. ’ but not everyone in the town best known for claiming to have hosted the ‘ world ’s first rodeo ’ in 1869 is taking the drone hunting as literally as @entity112			2
‘ even if a tiny percentage of people get [ a ] drone license , that 's cool , ’ resident and town board member @entity120 told @entity34			2
‘ that 's a lot of money to a small town like us			2
’ people like @entity120 and town clerk @entity131 have n’t given their full support to the idea of legalized drone hunting , but they can see fun and profit in a sort of ‘ @entity142 ’ celebrations with skeet shooting in lieu of the real thing			2
‘ i can see it as a benefit , monetarily speaking , because of the novelty of the ordinance , ’ said @entity131			0
the town board is scheduled to vote on drone hunting licenses august 6			0
' i have n't made my decision yet ' : @entity7 mayor @entity29 says he 's undecided on the measure , which is up for a vote august 6			1

@entity7 , @entity3 residents concerned over government surveillance want to fight back
' we do not want drones in town ' : *backers* admit they *'ve* never seen an unmanned plane *...* and never want to
