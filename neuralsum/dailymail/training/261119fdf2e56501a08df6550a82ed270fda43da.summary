abuse during visits : most of the charges @entity1 was convicted of relate to his time working at @entity44 when he 'd visit a @entity7 's home the report 's publication prompted a renewed apology from the current archbishop , dr @entity168 , who said the @entity2 church can never ignore the ‘ hurt and damage ’ of victims who should ‘ never have been let down ’ by people who should have been trusted			1
investigations into @entity1 began after police were handed a confidential report by @entity176 in may 2011 raising concerns about his conduct in the 1960s and early 1970s			1

he has also betrayed the trust and respect of many who have valued his ministry			0
today 's verdict will have repercussions in many different ways across @entity199 and beyond			0
‘ we are left with the question of why it has taken so long for these grave accusations to be taken seriously and brought to trial			0
what lessons do we all have to learn from this terrible catalogue of abuse about the strength and effectiveness of our communication within and between agencies that have responsibility for the safeguarding of children and vulnerable adults ? scandal - hit diocese : after the former archbishop of @entity150 dr @entity149 ( left ) ordered a visitation , a report into child protection in the @entity142 diocese was published , prompting current archbishop dr @entity168 ( right ) renewing an apology to victims ‘ in the diocese of @entity142 we shall continue to interrogate those procedures and to do our very best to ensure that we deliver the quality and standard that others expect of us			0

‘ a number of his victims attempted to speak out about what @entity1 was doing , but tragically at the time of the offences , a child 's word was not believed			1
‘ those who were brave enough to say anything were subjected to brutal beatings			0
some of his victims told police in interviews that it simply “ was n't worth complaining ” because of the punishment they would receive in return			0
' they may not have been believed as children , but today they finally have been			0
i hope that helps to give them closure			0
@entity37 , dr @entity38 chief crown prosecutor for @entity260 , @entity261 , said : ‘ this case is an example of how the @entity25 successfully prosecutes cases of child sexual abuse and should serve as a warning to those who think they can abuse children with impunity			2
‘ we are exceptionally mindful of how difficult it can be for victims to step forward and place their trust in the authorities many years later , but i hope this case illustrates the support and understanding they will receive from the prosecutors and the police when they do			2
’ police said none of the charges @entity1 faced related to claims of recent or current offending and there is no suggestion that any children are currently at risk			2
detective chief inspector @entity291 , of @entity116 , said : ‘ it is difficult to overestimate the significance of this verdict for those who have finally seen justice , many decades after being prey to the sexual abuse perpetrated by @entity1			2
‘ his offending over that period has been hugely impactive upon the lives of his victims , from childhood to the present day			0
‘ it is hoped this case will bring a sense of closure to all of those who provided evidence to the investigation while underlining to the wider community that it is never too late to report serious crimes , however long ago the alleged offending took place			0
