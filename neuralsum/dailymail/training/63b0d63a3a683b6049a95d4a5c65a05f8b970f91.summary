by @entity0 published : 18:07 est , 2 december 2012 @entity2 : 04:53 est , 3 december 2012 an interesting poser has been exercising the reverend @entity4 over the past week			1
she has posted several tweets on her @entity7 page — where she describes herself as an ‘ @entity9 priest , faith adviser , broadcaster ... and finder of funny things ’ — on the subject of ‘ the theology of fashion ’			1
she was so preoccupied by it that she even conducted a @entity19 debate on the subject			2
so we should n’t be too surprised then , that this weekend , the 32 - year - old @entity9 vicar took her theological studies even further forward , posing for a fashion shoot for a saturday broadsheet magazine under the headline : the @entity27			1
more @entity28 than @entity29 : this weekend , @entity30 posed for a fashion shoot for a saturday broadsheet magazine in the main picture , @entity30 is reclining on a leather chair wearing a £ 480 black leather jacket by @entity36 , a £ 505 @entity27 top and tight silver leather trousers by the @entity40 label that come in at just over £ 1,000			1
she also wears £ 535 leopard print @entity43 heels , that rest on a leather stool			1
in one shot , a heavily kohled eye gazes sultrily at the camera beneath a £ 239 @entity51 leopard skin hat set at a flirtatious angle , covering her other eye			1
her blood red lips pout above her sharply white dog collar			2
in another picture , the vicar poses in a £ 1,025 blue , back and cream @entity60 top , accessorised again with her dog collar			1
another uber - trendy picture sees @entity30 in a £ 646 black skirt by @entity65 , £ 209 @entity67 top , £ 355 shiny blazer by @entity69 and £ 995 ankle boots — again by @entity43			1
few of her flock can afford to wear such clothes — though in fairness , @entity30 borrowed them for the shoot			1
on her modest vicar ’s stipend , her label of choice is the fashionable but infinitely cheaper @entity82			2
but @entity30 certainly enjoyed herself			1
‘ wearing a dog collar in a fashion shoot was quite a powerful experience , ’ she declared afterwards , in a game attempt to give her day of dressing up in designer gear some sort of theological perspective			1
the fashion shoot appears to be some sort of response to last month ’s vote by the @entity9 ’s governing @entity94 , which decided against allowing women to become bishops			1
after agreeing to ordain women priests back in 1994 , it has taken until now for the vote for women bishops to take place			1
as a consequence of its failure , the schism between @entity9 ‘ traditionalists ’ and ‘ progressives ’ is wider than ever			2
there is no need to spell out whose side @entity30 , who had been mooted as a future bishop , is on			1
after all , would a ‘ traditionalist ’ wear @entity43 leopard print heels ? work attire : @entity4 has held the post of co-ordinating @entity9 chaplain and inter-faith adviser at @entity119 in @entity120 for the past six months exactly			1
it ’s a look that has n’t been received quite so well by the @entity9 ’s more traditional followers			2
but @entity30 believes she is not alone in the clergy in enjoying the frivolities of fashion			1
explaining that many priests like to ‘ accessorise ’ , she says : ‘ everything in life has two sides			0
it ’s not that the @entity9 is perfect and that twinsets and pearls are perfect			0
‘ it ’s not that some supposedly frivolous areas in life are not worthy enough for @entity137			0
the fashion industry is important			0
obviously , @entity134 said a lot of things about @entity137 i do n’t agree with , but there ’s his theory that beauty makes you good , that engaging with things that are beautiful is an antidote to the ugly and the difficult			0
‘ historically , the arts have been honoured by the @entity9 as a spiritual gift , and the first spiritual gift mentioned in the @entity151 is craftsmanship			0
the great cathedrals of @entity154 , the @entity156 painters , @entity158 ’s @entity157			0
the list is a long and fine one			0
now to add to it we have @entity43 ’s leopard print heels and a @entity60 top			0
‘ i ’m in awe of @entity60 , ’ she says			0
‘ i think she ’s got a gift from @entity137 , although i ’m not sure she would agree with me			0
’ woman of the cloth : a shot from @entity173 's @entity19 page @entity30 ’s unusual clerical style is apparent , too , on her @entity7 and @entity19 pages			1
for her @entity7 page , she selected a photograph of herself wearing a tiara - style hair clip			0
in one picture on @entity19 , she is winking at the camera			0
confronted by all this attention - seeking , one is duty bound to ask the question @entity30 is presumably dying for us to ask : is this really fitting behaviour for a woman of the cloth ? she has her own theory on this : ‘ there is that perception that religion is in a box with everything middle - aged and that everything else is in another box ; or ( as far as the clergy goes ) that @entity137 is interested only in middle - aged men			1
‘ but why should n’t a priest be interested in @entity27 ? i dress in a way that reflects my personality			1
’ last monday , @entity30 tweeted : ‘ thinking fashion theology : @entity206 said consider flowers if you ’re stressed “ how much more beautifully will @entity137 clothe you ”			1
’ but it would be unfair to suggest that @entity30 became a priest simply because she thought wearing a dog collar might make her look @entity213 parishioners say she is hard - working and committed , and as @entity30 says on her @entity7 profile : ‘ she loves many things : @entity137 , anthropology , @entity219 , good food with good friends , mostly @entity137 though			1
’ for the past six months , she has held the post of co-ordinating @entity9 chaplain and inter-faith adviser at @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity226			0
before that she was the vicar at @entity228 in @entity229			0
when she left last june , parishioners held a ‘ @entity232 ’ @entity231 ’ in her honour to say goodbye			0
so what led @entity30 on the path to serving @entity137 — and the fashion industry — as the @entity9 ’s most style - conscious vicar ? by her own account , she was brought up in @entity240 , @entity241 , the eldest of three daughters born to middle - class @entity245 parents who hoped to make ‘ a difference ’ to the then troubled neighbourhood in a way they believed the @entity251 had failed to do			1
her mother was a midwife , her father worked in the civil engineering department of the local council , specialising in drainage systems			0
at the age of 12 , @entity30 , who attended an all - girls ’ private school in @entity241 , became interested in religion and began going to church			1
‘ i recognised aspects of me : i felt like i was looking at somebody else ’s holiday snaps and looking at places that i had been			0
’ precisely what she means by this is not entirely clear			0
a future topic , perhaps , for her @entity19 page			0
fingers crossed : @entity30 attended @entity274 on november 20 for the @entity94 vote			1
she wore her favourite tiara clip and a leather jacket after school , she studied social policy at @entity281 , then spent three years working for a charity , for which she became a chaplain working in boarding schools			1
it was during this time that she decided to become a priest			2
she studied theology at @entity289 and was ordained in 2009			0
as an ordinand ( a priest in training ) , she spent two months shadowing the future archbishop of @entity294 , @entity293 , when he was a canon at @entity296			2
in response to a rumour that @entity299 , curate in the @entity301 comedy series @entity302 , is based on her , she says : ‘ i hope not			2
she ’s really obnoxious and annoying			0
’ @entity30 lives in @entity226 and prefers to keep her private life private			1
it is not known if she is in a relationship ; she has no children : ‘ i would n’t be doing what i ’m doing if i ’d had children			0
and i ’m very happy with the way things are			0
’ over the past few months , @entity30 ’s profile has grown as she has appeared on various programmes on television to discuss the issue of women bishops			1
during one interview on breakfast tv last month she wore her pretty tiara clip in her hair			2
this prompted a response from one internet blogger who might be said to represent the ‘ traditionalists ’ within the @entity9			2
‘ this is the sort of spectacle traditional @entity328 feared when they allowed the ordination of women , ’ the blogger wrote			2
‘ we would n’t expect a policewoman to accessorise her uniform like this — nor do her hair up like she ’s off to a ball			0
‘ she seems rather too vain to hold offices which require quiet dignity			0
’ with other female clergy , @entity30 attended @entity274 on november 20 for the @entity94 vote			1
again , she wore her favourite tiara clip , a leather jacket , black leather boots and a fashionable mustard - coloured bag			2
sadly , it was n’t enough			0
the vote in favour of women bishops failed			1
@entity30 says she was ‘ shocked ’ and ‘ sad ’ , but adds that the issue has become an ‘ unstoppable train			1
it is bound to happen			0
as a feminist , i believe that women should n’t be held back from anything			2
women have worked very hard , whether they ’re religious or not , to make sure that is the case			2
’ however , she says she believes it would be unwise for the @entity359 to intervene : ‘ i also think that if the @entity9 is dictated to by society or the @entity359 , it ceases to be a church			0
’ yesterday , it was business as usual for @entity30			1
she gave a sermon to mark the beginning of @entity367 at @entity228 in @entity368 , then returned in the evening for a carol service clad in traditional vestments and platform heels			0
one parishioner , 81 - year - old @entity372 , was supportive of her			0
‘ why should n’t she dress like that ? she ’s young and it might bring people into the church , ’ she said			2
fittingly , then , the theme of her sermon was hope and expectation , a traditional homily from the vicar who just happens to wear leopard print @entity384 .			0

rev @entity4 posed in tight silver leather trousers worth over £ 1000
shoot was response to vote for women bishops that took place last month
