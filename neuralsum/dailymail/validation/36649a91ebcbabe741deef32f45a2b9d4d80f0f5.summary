during a hectic week in @entity0 , @entity1 is engrossed in all things @entity3			1
whether it ’s watching @entity7 ’s next @entity6 opponents on dvd , learning the language with his demanding tutor or sampling another tasty @entity12 speciality dish from the atmospheric pintxos bars , @entity1 ca n’t escape it			1
but he does like to switch off now and again and turn his attention to the @entity16 national team			1
he will watch @entity18 ’s side on the television this week as they play @entity20 and then the @entity22 qualifier against @entity23			1
@entity1 has been a manager at the highest level for more than a decade with @entity25 , @entity26 and now @entity27 , and he understands the scrutiny and intensity fellow bosses face from boardrooms , fans and media			1
@entity7 manager @entity1 has been impressed with @entity16 boss @entity18 @entity18 , pictured in november , is preparing his side for their match against @entity20 that is why he has nothing but admiration for the job @entity18 is doing			1
the national team sit in a decent position in @entity43 , in third place with seven points from four games			1
the weekend ’s fixture should be comfortable			2
@entity1 hopes so and believes @entity18 and his players have the determination and ability to be at the party in 2016			1
‘ @entity18 is doing a fabulous job			1
he has everybody believing again but it ’s good that there is a measured amount of optimism and nobody in the country has any stupid levels of expectation , ’ @entity1 told @entity52			1
‘ we ’ve had unrealistic ambitions in years gone by and it has n’t done us any favours			2
‘ there is belief , and rightly so			2
i think we are introducing more and more young players and they have taken to it very well			2
‘ the more experienced players are maturing nicely and the fact a few of them have @entity71 experience certainly helps			2
‘ all things considered , @entity18 is doing a quite brilliant job			1
the 1 - 0 win against @entity78 was an important victory			2
@entity18 will want to kick on and make sure there is a win on sunday			1
@entity82 ( far left ) impressed @entity1 during their time together at @entity25 @entity1 ( left ) worked with @entity82 ( right ) during his brief stint as the manager of the @entity25 ‘ but he does n’t have a magic wand			1
it ’s difficult being a national manager because you ca n’t buy a new centre half or a new left back , you have to work with what you ’ve got			1
that means you have to get the very best out of the players , try to improve them in order to maximise their standards when they play			2
‘ i ’m not going to add to the pressure by saying i expect @entity16 to qualify			1
what i will say is that i hope they do			2
‘ we last reached a @entity104 17 years ago and i was in @entity105 to support them			2
i was manager of @entity108 and also used it as an opportunity to enhance my knowledge by taking in games and sessions			2
‘ if we qualify for 2016 , i will be there again			0
’ @entity1 hopes two of his former players — @entity82 and @entity117 — continue their good work at this level			1
@entity1 signed @entity117 for @entity26 after @entity120 went into liquidation and the player exercised his right to leave for no fee			1
it was a no - brainer to sign him under such circumstances			0
the versatile star is now valued in excess of £ 8million			0
@entity1 is delighted @entity82 is back in the international fold after successfully battling a chronic bowel disease			1
he worked with the midfielder at @entity132 and has huge respect for him			0
@entity1 signed @entity16 international @entity117 for £ 8million from @entity120 back in july 2012 when @entity1 lost his job at @entity25 in april of last year , @entity82 was one of the first on the phone to text offering sympathy and expressing regret at the way it all worked out			1
‘ @entity82 is a superb person and a great footballer , ’ @entity1 said			1
‘ i had the pleasure of working with him and he was an even better player than i thought			0
he was great in the dressing room , trustworthy and had the best interests of the club at heart			0
‘ his health problems were well documented but he never once complained			0
i hold @entity82 in high regard			1
i ’m delighted he is relishing the responsibility of captaining @entity152			0
‘ @entity153 is a good lad			0
he really has come on leaps and bounds at @entity26			0
‘ it was always going to be difficult for him in his first year when he came from @entity120			0
but he has listened and developed into an important member of the @entity26 team because he can play a number of different roles			2
‘ @entity18 will be pleased to have guys such as @entity82 and @entity153			1
‘ they are excellent senior professionals and the perfect examples for the new arrivals to learn from			0
’ @entity7 boss @entity1 masterminded a 1 - 0 win over @entity166 at the beginning of january there is genuine feeling for the @entity16 set - up from @entity1			1
spending a few days in his company in @entity0 made that clear			0
he and his assistant , @entity172 , love nothing more than chewing the fat over issues in the game back home			2
they have lifted @entity27 into the top half of @entity6 with excellent results , including a 1 - 0 win over @entity166			0
sunday night ’s 3 - 1 victory against @entity183 was their third win on the bounce and only an almighty collapse in their remaining 10 games would see them relegated			0
the remit for @entity1 when he took over in mid-november was to avoid the drop at all costs			1
they were fifth from bottom at that stage			0
he is enjoying the challenge and is contracted until the summer of 2016			0
he would like to return to the @entity198 at some stage and is currently the bookies ’ favourite to take over from @entity202 at @entity203 , but he is in no rush to leave @entity205			0
he said : ‘ i ’m enjoying life here and have really tried to make an effort to adapt to the culture			0
‘ it ’s very pleasant and everyone has been warm and courteous			0
‘ @entity172 and i both sense that the people really want us to do well			0
we ’re trying to make them happy			2
‘ this is a big club and i can improve myself as a coach by being here			0
‘ this job also helped me get over the disappointment of what happened at @entity25			0
i felt this was as good a place as any to do just that			0
‘ to come to @entity27 and work in @entity6 has absolutely been the right decision			0
