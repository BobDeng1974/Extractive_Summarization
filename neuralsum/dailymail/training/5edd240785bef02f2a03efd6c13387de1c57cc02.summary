by @entity0 published : 13:36 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 13:36 est , 9 june 2013 a test used for heart disease is ' flawed ' and may be leading to thousands of patients being given the wrong treatment , an expert has warned			1
professor @entity6 said that x-rays for angina - a painful tightening of the chest - give inaccurate results in a quarter of all patients			1
the tests , called angiograms , involve patients being given a local anaesthetic while a long tube is inserted into their groin or arm up to the coronary artery in the heart			2
flawed : according to professor @entity6 , angiograms are inaccurate in 26 per cent of cases a dye is then passed through the tube while a series of x-rays are taken which show up any blockages in the arteries			1
professor @entity6 , a consultant cardiologist at @entity30 , said the x-rays do not give a precise reading on whether blood flow is restricted			1
he said angiograms should be used alongside another procedure which involves inserting a tiny wire into arteries which measure the blood pressure			2
professor @entity6 carried out a trial on 200 patients which showed that angiograms led to the wrong treatment in 26 per cent of cases			1
during the trial patients were given angiograms and doctors then decided on their treatment			2
they then underwent the second procedure , a fractional flow reserve test , and doctors were asked if they would change the treatment			0
in 26 per cent of cases they did			0
faulty : the test is supposed to pick up arterial blockages such as the one above but does n't always get it right professor @entity6 said : ' the results indicate management of patients with stable angina by angiogram alone is probably flawed and treatment would be much more tailored to the individual through routine use of a @entity66 pressure test at the diagnostic stage			1
' he now wants to conduct a much larger trial in the hope it will lead to a ' major change ' in the way tests are done			0
about one in seven men and one in 12 women over 65 suffer from angina although it is also common in patients in their fifties			0
it occurs when the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed resulting in a heavy , tight pain that can spread to the arms and neck			0
angina is a form of heart disease and patients may go on to suffer heart attacks and strokes if it is not properly treated			0
patients are given a spray or pills to take once an attack starts and other drugs to help prevent them .			0

angiograms are inaccurate 26 *%* of the time says professor @entity6
professor @entity6 , a cardiologist , said another procedure is needed
the results were revealed following a trial involving 200 heart patients
flawed angiograms result in *inappropriate* treatment being *prescribed*
