by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 have warned that the @entity4 finals are under threat from match fixers			1
their security experts say they have identified teams and @entity4 groups which are vulnerable			1
@entity10 , @entity2 ’s head of security who is ready to take on the fixers , said : ‘ everyone has a history			1
@entity16 have history , players have history , refs have history			0
vigilant : @entity2 's director of security @entity10 says the @entity4 wo n't be free of match - fixing attempts nothing to play for : @entity10 says matches with teams already out of the tournament are most at risk ‘ we know warm - up matches were thrown in the last @entity4 so that is also useful information to help us counter things			1
we are not expecting fixers to be travelling to @entity37 and knocking on the hotel door of players or referees but i know there will have been approaches to players and referees			2
‘ i can not tell you the teams we are watching most closely			0
i ca n’t tell you the groups which we are watching most closely			2
but i will say that @entity48 ’s group is not the highest risk			0
’ @entity10 , a former @entity51 executive and police officer , has warned that warm - up games and the last round of group matches are the most vulnerable , as some of those will involve teams with nothing to play for			1
fixers will focus on the number of goals in a match and are most likely to entice players or referees to influence two betting markets : the @entity66 handicap and the over-under goals market , where more than 99 per cent of bets in @entity66 are placed			1
under threat : there were reports the @entity76 v @entity72 friendly in @entity74 was targeted by fixers in the first , teams are handicapped according to their form so a stronger team must win by more goals for a bet to be successful			1
‘ i would say i am most worried about these two markets , ’ @entity10 told the @entity83			1
‘ we had training sessions with referees in @entity88			0
we are also going to meet them prior to kick - off and we also will visit the team and players for security sessions			2
we will give them a reminder to report an approach from fixers			2
‘ we have an officer in the stadium and he will act on my decision if necessary			0
it will depend on the information and the response required			0
‘ he can just monitor the situation regarding players , referees , others			0
he could approach people during half - time or directly after the game			0
‘ he also can use technical equipment to identify possible fixers in the stadium			0
