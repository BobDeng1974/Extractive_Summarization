a @entity1 lawmaker who resigned his seat following a sex scandal involving a teenage employee won it back during a special election tuesday			1
apparently plenty of voters in @entity11 's @entity10 - area @entity13 district were ok with his conviction in the scandal involving his 17 - year - old secretary , whose nude photo was found on his cellphone and allegedly shared with a friend			1
@entity11 has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing , saying his phone was hacked			1
the young woman , who denies they had sex , is now pregnant			2
but he successfully conducted a political campaign – for the seat he was forced to vacate upon his guilty plea to the crime of contributing to the delinquency of a minor – from behind bars			1
with all the precincts reporting , @entity11 defeated democrat @entity33 and @entity35 @entity34 by a comfortable margin			1
he won 42 percent of the vote , compared to 33 percent for @entity33 and 24 percent for @entity34			0
@entity11 ( left ) crushed the competition for his old @entity40 seat on tuesday , including rival @entity34 ( right ) , despite having to wear a court - ordered ankle bracelet and sleeping each night behind bars ; he learned of his victory via a jailhouse pay phone @entity46 , do n't judge : @entity11 has said he might try to commute to the statehouse from jail during his sentence related to an alleged sexual relationship with an underage girl ' this is a victory for the ages , ' @entity54 political science professor @entity53 told the @entity57			1
' rarely has a politician with as many problems emerged victorious			0
for a man who has more baggage than @entity62 to win speaks volumes for his ability to connect with the district despite all of his liabilities			0
' prosecutors in @entity11 's criminal case said that in addition to the sexual relationship he carried on with @entity71 , now an 18 - year - old college freshman , he sent a naked photo of her to a friend			1
part of the evidence against him , which he read to reporters on the courthouse steps in july , was a text allegedly from his young paramour to a third - party , reading : ' @entity84 , i just f * * * ed my boss			1
' he claimed the photo and the text messages were planted by a 24 - year - old woman named @entity89 , who grew jealous after @entity90 rejected her lesbian advances			1
but special prosecutor @entity92 told the @entity57 at the time that @entity11 ' had sex with her twice in his law office and texted someone about it			1
' @entity11 's victory was not unprecedented : through four previous elections , most voters overlooked or even embraced the lawmaker 's flamboyant history of fistfights , contempt - of - court citations and disbarment			1
the 57 - year - old bachelor , who fathered three children out of wedlock with three different women , repeatedly won at least 70 percent of the vote as a @entity33			1
@entity11 said in a telephone interview that the results show people are n't interested in the drama that landed him in jail			2
' they 're interested in my body of work in the @entity122 , ' @entity11 told the @entity123			2
' nobody works harder for their constituents than i do			0
' he also said @entity33 's ads focusing on his latest scrape with the law backfired : ' people hate negative campaigns			0
' the lawmaker has made a career of never backing down			0
he hung boxing gloves in his office and promised ' @entity11 will fight for you ' in campaign ads on city buses			1
in 2013 he waved an @entity141 rifle inside the @entity13 chamber while arguing for gun control			0
that brought back memories of a 1994 incident when police recovered an uzi submachine gun in from a heroin dealer – a gun that police had loaned @entity11 , then a prosecutor , for use as a prop when he spoke at schools about drugs and violence			1
the 57 - year - old has seen his law license suspended and revoked , has paid a $ 500,000 judgment to a man he brutally beat in 1999 , lost a job teaching law in @entity164 for hiding his disbarment , and earned his nickname – ' @entity11 ' – for engaging in a courtroom fistfight while he was a prosecutor in 1991			1
he resigned his seat — effective tuesday , the day of this special election — as part of a plea deal			2
the misdemeanor conviction allowed him to avoid a felony trial that could have barred him from office and put him in prison for years			2
he originally faced grand jury indictments on charges including taking indecent liberties with a minor , possession of pornographic images of an underage female , and solicitation to obtain the images			0
but @entity11 would n't give up — he promptly quit his party to run as an independent for his seat , sleeping in jail and wearing an electronic monitoring device as he campaigned during the day			1
legislators from both parties denounced him as unfit to serve and began studying how to expel him if he won			0
' mr. @entity11 's election tonight does not change the fact that his actions fall grievously short of the standards of a public servant in the @entity13 , ' house speaker @entity192 , a @entity35 , said in a statement			2
@entity199 shot : @entity11 has been in and out of jail for decades , in between suspensions and revocations of his law license not shooting straight : @entity11 brandished an @entity141 during a floor debate about gun rights , but had earlier admitted losing track of an @entity208 that law enforcement officers had loaned him for use as a prop during speeches @entity13 @entity214 minority leader @entity213 and party caucus chairman @entity215 said in a joint statement that @entity11 's ' conviction and actions over the past two months were reprehensible , and we will be exploring every avenue in regard to his status as a member of the @entity13			2
' according to @entity13 clerk g. @entity225 , it takes two - thirds of the 100 - member @entity13 to expel a member – something that has n't happened since 1876			0
the @entity228 says a legislator can be kicked out for ' disorderly ' behavior – which is n't defined			0
@entity11 vowed to wage a voting rights battle on behalf of the people who re-elected him if his foes try to remove him			2
his latest troubles began when @entity235 told authorities that the lawmaker was preying on his daughter when she worked at his law office in 2013 — allegations he repeated in campaign ads last week for @entity11 's @entity214 opponent			1
but @entity11 's staunchest defender is @entity71 , now 18 , who went public this month with her side of the story			1
she insists she never had sex with @entity11 but has refused to identify the father of her unborn child			2
and she publicly defended @entity11 on monday in a radio interview			2
@entity10 radio host @entity250 was interviewing @entity235 on @entity251 about his daughter 's relationship with @entity11 when the lawmaker called in to defend himself			1
ms. @entity71 then showed up at the broadcast studio in person , accusing her father and others of manufacturing the entire scandal to get back at @entity11 for his help in a dispute over her father 's child support			2
it was @entity11 's role in that family dispute that reportedly prompted police to serve a search warrant of his office monday afternoon , with only hours to go before the voting started			1
@entity11 called that a political dirty trick			2
' the only person that has shown any respect or kindness , or been there for me , is mr. @entity11 , ' @entity71 told a @entity280 reporter on monday			2
' right now it 's a friendship			0
i do n't speak with him often			0
i call here and there to check on him			0
i want to see how his spirits are going			0
' @entity11 supported her in turn			0
' she is a very smart young lady , ' he told the radio host			0
' she is kind , she is considerate			0
she will go on to do very well			0
' @entity289 : on sunday , jan. 11 , women protested against @entity11 as he left the @entity291 for voters , @entity294 forum @entity92 , the special prosecutor , has a long history with @entity11			1
he unsuccessfully opposed the reinstatement of the politician 's law license in 2011 , claiming he ' completely lacks any moral compass ' and engaged in ' notoriously unethical practices			0
' that opinion came with a litany of evidence			0
he landed two fists on the face of a flamboyant defense attorney during the 1991 courtroom brawl , landing in jail			1
in 1993 the @entity311 yanked his license to practice law after he was indicted on a bribery charge			0
that case concerned his decision to dismiss a rape charge against a defendant whose father allegedly paid his victim $ 25,000 to get himself off the hook , and another $ 25,000 to a list of charities @entity11 chose			1
charges against @entity11 in that case were later dismissed			0
five years later , his license was suspended a second time after a 90 - day stint in jail for contempt of court , for tainting a drug prosecution by leaking information to reporters			1
a judge in that proceeding banned him from arguing cases in court for two years			0
in 1999 @entity11 was sentenced to 300 hours of community service after physically assaulting a home contractor			1
according to a legal brief filed by the home contractor 's attorneys , @entity11 shouted , ' i 'm going to kill you			0
i 'm going to beat your head in , ' before beating the victim and ' smash ( ing ) his head into the corner of a brick wall			0
' in 2002 the victim won a judgment against him in civil court , which he paid off with a $ 500,000 check in 2007 , @entity351 reported			1
but @entity11 was n't as diligent with his community - service sentence : a court found he tried submitted phony documentation showing how many hours he had worked off , and sent him to jail for another 90 days			1
the bar association ' disbarred ' him for that offense , tearing up his law license permanently – but relented a decade later and reinstated him in 2012			0
but meanwhile , @entity11 made headlines for losing his job teaching law in @entity164 when authorities there learned of his disbarment in the @entity370			0

last year @entity11 was arrested for allegedly sleeping with a 17 - year - old office assistant and sending a naked picture of the now - pregnant 18 - year - old to a friend
both denied a sexual relationship despite *mounting* evidence of time they spent together ; he claimed a hacker planted photos and texts on his phone
one text , allegedly from the young girl , read : ' @entity84 , i just f * * * ed my boss '
' @entity11 ' got his nickname from a 1991 courtroom fistfight during his years as a prosecutor
in 2007 @entity11 paid a man $ 500,000 to settle a court judgment against him for a separate 1999 physical assault
he won re-election tuesday as an independent , reclaiming the seat he was forced to vacate by a comfortable margin
