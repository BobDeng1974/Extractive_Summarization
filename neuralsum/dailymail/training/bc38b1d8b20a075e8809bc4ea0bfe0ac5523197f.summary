@entity1 's attack on the tax arrangements of @entity4 donors took a new turn last night when it emerged that one of his own backers had millions of shares in an offshore trust			1
sir @entity10 , who has given more than £ 1.2 million to @entity11 , transferred shares to @entity13 and @entity14 , some of which were later sold for a reported £ 37 million			1
the disclosure comes after mr @entity1 denounced ‘ dodgy @entity4 donors ’ and named @entity19 tycoon and conservative backer @entity20 as one of those with @entity25 accounts with the controversial @entity27 bank			1
sir @entity10 , left has given more than £ 1.2 million to the @entity11 in advance of the election , although claims that he may have used an offshore trust to reduce his tax bill could impact @entity1 , right but last night the focus was back on @entity11 ’s backers after company returns showed details of sir @entity10 ’s multi-million - pound business background			1
in 1995 , seven years after he founded property company @entity40 , he transferred more than 16 million of its shares to a @entity13 firm acting on behalf of his family trust , with a further 1.8 million shares going to a trust company in @entity14			1
when sir @entity10 retired as chairman of @entity40 in 2005 , it was reported that his family trust sold 13.4 million shares in the company , leading to a huge windfall for them			1
shortly afterwards , sir @entity10 was contacted by @entity55 ’s fundraiser @entity53 , who persuaded him to loan the party £ 2.3 million			1
he then became embroiled in the ‘ cash for peerages ’ row after being nominated for the honour in the same year – a move which was dropped in the ensuing furore			0
sir @entity10 has gifted £ 690,000 to labour while mr @entity1 has been leader			1
sir @entity10 , 75 , who has an estimated £ 100 million fortune , moved to @entity25 with his wife @entity64 following his 2005 retirement , taking up permanent residency in a @entity68 hotel suite , although he agreed to resume paying @entity70 tax when the offer of a peerage was made months later			2
a leading tax expert told @entity74 : ‘ putting company shares offshore is one way to maximise the chance of legally avoiding tax when they are disposed of at a future date			0
there is no way of telling whether sir @entity10 took advantage of this ’			2
last night , a spokesman for sir @entity10 stressed that there was ‘ no irregularity or impropriety in the conduct of his financial affairs ’ and ‘ all of his financial affairs have been conducted in the full view and knowledge of the @entity70 tax authorities ’			2
a source added that the @entity10 family had benefited from the 2005 shares windfall , not sir @entity10			2
@entity11 said : ‘ all our donations are declared and published in line with @entity103 rules			0
’ yesterday mr @entity1 accused the @entity104 of ‘ shrugging its shoulders ’ on tax avoidance			0
however , the @entity107 hit back , saying the last @entity108 should be held responsible for the level of avoidance			0
‘ the culture and practices of @entity115 went wrong under @entity11 – when top bankers paid lower tax rates than their cleaners , foreigners did n’t pay capital gains tax and the richest people routinely avoided paying stamp duty , ’ said a spokesman			0
in a further development , a former conservative trade minister at the centre of the @entity27 row stood down from his role at the financial industry lobbying group @entity127			0
lord @entity128 , the former chairman of @entity27 , headed the bank during the period when staff at its @entity25 operation appeared to be helping @entity70 customers to avoid tax .			0

sir @entity10 transferred shares offshore before some were later sold
the tycoon has given the @entity11 more than £ *1.2million*
@entity1 attacked ' dodgy @entity4 donors ' for having off - shore accounts
sir @entity10 held accounts in @entity13 and @entity14 according to reports
