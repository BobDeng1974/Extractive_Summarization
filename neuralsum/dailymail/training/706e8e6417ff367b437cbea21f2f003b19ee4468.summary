justice @entity0 clearly does n't believe in the old adage that bad news comes in threes			1
if she did she would have run a mile when she was asked to take charge of the independent inquiry into historic child sex abuse			1
the first two women picked by home secretary @entity10 , @entity11 and dame @entity12 , had to stand down over their links with the @entity14			1
but as justice @entity0 sits in her office in @entity17 , @entity18 , she shrugs off the suggestion that the job is cursed			1
' it was unfortunate for the people concerned but not a poisoned chalice			1
' here to stay : the first two women picked by home secretary @entity10 to head the inquiry had to stand down over their links with the @entity14 , but justice @entity0 insists it is ' not a poisoned chalice ' @entity28 , 66 , is descended on her father 's side from @entity32 , chief of the @entity33 ( tribe ) in the mid- 1800s			1
her forefather 's first name translates as @entity38 , a quaint fusion of @entity40 and @entity41			2
although only one - sixteenth @entity41 , it shows in @entity0 's tall , athletic frame			1
she was made a dame last year , but talk of the @entity14 is batted away			2
it does n't exist where she comes from , she maintains			2
' @entity49 is a classless society			1
we are n't concerned who people 's great - grandfather was , it 's what they do themselves that 's important			2
' how do i come to grips with the fact that there 's a ruling class ? go about my job without fear or favour , that 's how i operate			2
' she has a natural authority , but a relaxed air , too , as she demonstrated when her phone beeps during the interview			2
' it 's my husband wanting to know how long i 'll be , ' she says			2
hopefully , not as long as your inquiry , i joked			1
' no , or we 'll be sitting here like @entity80 covered in cobwebs			2
' @entity0 's father , @entity49 @entity83 pilot @entity82 , was killed in an air crash when she was three			1
she was 20 when she fell in love with first husband @entity87 in 1969			2
or to give him his full name , sir @entity89 , 5th @entity90 , of @entity91			2
as establishment as they come			2
' he 's just @entity87 , ' she says			0
' he was travelling with some chums			0
' within months @entity87 returned to @entity96 – with @entity97 as his bride			0
a whirlwind romance ? ' probably			0
people did n't have these lengthy engagements that they have now			0
i get married , other people just live with people and apparently that 's not remarkable			0
ancestry : @entity0 , 66 , is descended on her father 's side from @entity32 ( pictured ) , chief of the @entity41 tribe axed : @entity111 quit as chairman of the inquiry after questions were raised about her brother sitting in the @entity116 in the 1980s			1
her replacement @entity12 later resigned over her links to former home secretary @entity119 ' these days people live with someone for years , get engaged for two years , then eventually get married , i ca n't see the point of it			1
' when i married @entity87 , i was still living at home			1
' a year later they had a daughter , @entity127			0
but the marriage was quickly over			0
' by @entity129 1970 i was very homesick			0
i came home with the baby and did n't go back			1
it was difficult for both of us			0
' @entity0 was soon swept off her feet by another @entity96 abroad , @entity137 , a lecturer at @entity138 , where she was studying			1
' he was a gorgeous man , ' she recalls			0
but their love was tragic			0
' @entity137 had done voluntary service in @entity143 and got hepatitis , it attacked his heart muscle and got worse			0
' i knew he was dying but it mattered to him very much to marry me , so we did and he died a year later , just after my 26th birthday			0
' @entity0 buried her head in her law studies – and being mum to daughter @entity154			1
she is the first woman with @entity41 ancestry to become a high court judge in @entity49			1
in 1992 she married third husband and fellow lawyer @entity158			0
the couple share a passion for horses – something that made child abuse survivors fear she was another member of the @entity14			1
' they said , ' this sounds posh			0
' i told them it 's not like that at home – most of our riders come from farms			1
in @entity49 , rugby , racing and beer are the national pastimes			1
' @entity0 is no soft touch : as a @entity49 judge she handed out a record 28 - year jail sentence to a child killer			1
' judges have to do more than simply take a ' legal ' view , ' she says			0
' judges are human beings			0
you have to look at the human misery that has been caused – and we 're all shaped by our experiences			0
' the experiences that have shaped @entity0 include having a ' lovely and sporty ' @entity193 brother , aged 64			1
but she fears the huge amount of internet pornography could encourage sex crimes			2
' it ca n't be healthy			0
i 'm sure psychologists would say the desensitisation gives it an artificial air of normalisation , which is very dangerous			0
' @entity0 is a common - sense traditionalist with more than a dash of modern liberation			1
but not so modern or liberated to be interested in @entity208			0
' i have n't read the book and wo n't be seeing the film , ' she grins			0
' i gather it 's pretty gross			0

justice @entity0 now heading inquiry into historic child sex abuse
*investigation* was *sparked* by claims of 1980s @entity220 *paedophile* ring
first two women picked by home secretary @entity10 were stood down
but the role is ' not a poisoned chalice ' insists the @entity49 born judge
