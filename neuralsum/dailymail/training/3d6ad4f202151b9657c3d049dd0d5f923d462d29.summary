a woman has told of her horror at being left deformed and battling life - threatening injuries after a plastic surgeon injected fillers into her face that went disastrously wrong			1
@entity6 , 53 , from @entity7 , bought the @entity9 filler treatment from a @entity11 surgeon eight years ago after seeing an advert online			1
but a few years later , the chemicals started to move around her face , leaving her with unsightly bumps that quickly became severely infected			1
years later , the chemicals moved around , causing disfigurement and infections			1
she is sharing her story as a warning @entity6 , who works as an accounts administrator , had to be hospitalised twice because the infections were so critical			1
she has since had the fillers removed by another surgeon and is on the road to recovery , but shared her story on @entity34 's @entity33 this evening to warn others to do proper research before booking cosmetic procedures			1
@entity6 initially bought cheek implants in the 1980s , in order to make her face look less miserable			1
she said : ' i used to get complete strangers coming up to me saying " oh cheer up " , " you look so miserable " , " it 's never going to happen "			0
' i used to look at people who had lovely big cheekbones and i wanted that			0
i did n't want to look sad anymore			0
' i went to the @entity48 to a particular surgeon			0
i knew nothing about him or the procedure , i just said i wanted cheek implants in my face			2
' @entity6 started cosmtetic surgery in the 1980s when she saw an article in a magazine for cheek implants initially , @entity6 was delighted with the results , but the effect did n't last long			1
she said : ' after about two months the implants went down to the size of little teaspoons - you could clearly see the outline			0
' as time went on , she became increasingly unhappy about her appearance again and turned to the internet for a solution			0
she said : ' when i read about this permanent filler i thought , " i 'm going to get this done			0
this is finally the answer i 've been looking for			0
" ' @entity6 's family and friends told her that was being ridiculous , but her mind was made up and she flew to @entity11 to meet with a surgeon that she found on the internet who said he could do @entity9 fillers			1
she said : ' he said to me the filler was completely safe , there were no problems with it , he 'd even put some in his own wife			0
' he put it all down my jaw , in my cheeks , around my eyes and in my temple area			0
' my friends and family were quite shocked at the way i looked , ( but ) i was really pleased with the results			0
' @entity6 used to look at people who had ' lovely big cheekbones ' and want them			1
she did n't want to ' look sad ' however , @entity6 's happiness was not to last			1
the filler that had once given her confidence and self - assurance started to swell and migrate around her face			2
with her face now completely deformed , she sought out a doctor in @entity7			1
she said : ' i 'll never forget the look on his face			2
the first thing he said to me was , " did you sue whoever did this to you ? " now desperate , @entity6 returned to the surgeon in @entity11 who immediately agreed that she needed some of the fillers removed			1
she said : ' he squeezed some ( of it ) out , mainly around my temple area , and i remember thinking that it was like a ticking time bomb in my face			2
' that time bomb was about to explode - with devastating consequences			0
soon afterwards , @entity6 was rushed to hospital with a swollen face from severe infection			1
she said : ' i felt overwhelmed with fear			0
' in a bid to get her botched face fixed , @entity6 paid a visit to cranial facial surgeon @entity139 , in @entity11			1
he examined her face and felt for potential danger zones although she wanted most of the filler gone , @entity6 was desperate to be able keep her cheek implants because she was scared that she would be ' left with nothing ' if they were removed			1
the surgeon then booked her in for an mri scan to help determine exactly where the @entity19 is , so he could work out how to remove it			1
@entity6 left @entity139 's office pleased she was heading in the right direction , however , just three days later she was rushed to hospital with another life - threatening infection caused by the filler			1
the filler that had once given her confidence and self - assurance had started to swell and migrate now that the filler is all removed , @entity6 says she feels much less anxious it was even more severe than her previous infection and she was put on an intravenous drip of antibiotics			1
this time , it took seven days to bring the bacteria - infected filler that was distorting her face under control			2
the cosmetic industry 's biggest money spinners include laser hair removal , @entity173 , fillers			2
it is an area which is almost entirely unregulated			0
there are hundreds of fillers available , including @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity19 and @entity182 to name just a few			1
@entity19 , a permanent skin filler , was made for the medical industry to replace tissue lost by people suffering from wasting conditions or who have had large tumours removed			1
it has since been taken up by cosmetic surgeries as a way to plump up the skin			0
as the name suggests , once a permanent filler is injected , they remain in the body forever			2
if they move , patients can be left with unsightly lumps or bumps which are difficult to remove			2
bad reactions to fillers can cause facial necrosis , disfigurement , nerve damage and anaphylactic shock			0
@entity6 said : ' the fact it was happening twice - i never expected that			2
' i really did n't expect to get another infection so soon and i think it was actually more scary			0
' with her health at such risk , it became crucial that the filler was removed before another infection struck			0
she came back to @entity11 to see surgeon @entity139 for the results of her @entity221 scan			0
the news was n't good - @entity6 had two implants in each cheek - one on top of the other - and unfortunately they were surrounded by @entity9 filler , meaning they would have to be removed along with the liquid			2
to compensate , @entity139 suggested a mid-facelift to help counter any sagging that might occur once everything was removed			0
now that the filler is all removed @entity6 says she feels much less anxious - although she is still concerned about the swelling around her eyes			2
@entity139 has assured assured her that the healing process can take up to six months though , and that she should be patient			0
she said : ' i do think i made a mistake all those years ago - definitely - having that stuff put in my face			2
' i think permanent filler equals permanent problems			0
i would never advise anyone to have it done			0
' @entity6 appears on @entity33 , tonight on @entity34			1
