the first wife of great train robber @entity1 has died aged 75 , just a year after the criminal husband with whom she went into hiding in @entity3 also passed away			1
@entity4 was 17 when she met @entity1 , then 27 and already a petty criminal , on a commuter train in 1957 - and her school headmaster father forbade her from seeing him			1
his advice was well - founded			2
six years later @entity1 would become the most notorious figure in the 1963 raid which stole £ 2.6million of banknotes from a @entity12 to @entity14 mail train			1
the pair are pictured together two years before their 1976 divorce fugitives : @entity1 ( left in 1992 ) and his wife ( right ) fled to @entity3 where they lived together for three years despite insisting the first she knew of his crime was when he came home with a six - figure share of the loot , @entity24 stuck by her husband			1
when he fled to @entity3 on a false passport after breaking out of prison - stopping on the way in @entity32 for £ 40,000 of plastic surgery - she waited until he had settled and then joined him			2
they lived together in @entity35 and @entity36 for three years under false names and had a third child			1
having run a boarding house when he arrived in @entity3 under the name @entity41 , @entity1 took a job as a foreman carpenter at a @entity36 airport in the name of @entity46			1
but in 1969 , @entity47 were tipped off and @entity1 fled to @entity48			1
despite everything , @entity4 remained on good terms with her husband after their 1976 divorce - triggered by him fathering a son with another woman in his new country			1
audacious : the raiders escaped with £ 2.6million but left the train 's driver with permanent injuries couple : @entity1 was ten years @entity60 's senior when the met on a commuter train in 1957 if it was a love match , it was also a marriage of convenience			1
once @entity1 ' new lover @entity64 was pregnant , he became immune from extradition as the father of a @entity48 child			1
when the robber died in december 2013 - 12 years after he finally returned to @entity69 and jail amid ailing health - his @entity48 - born son revealed his first wife would receive a third of his ashes			1
in the robber 's typically unrepentant style , another third of the ashes were to be spread over the scene of the crime at @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83			2
@entity4 was allowed to stay in @entity3 with their children , later revealing her husband had spent all his loot , a lot of it in ' bribes and hush money '			1
after their 1976 divorce she sold her story to an @entity3 media group for a reported £ 40,000 , the first of many such deals			1
she was also paid an undisclosed consultancy fee for the @entity98 series @entity24 in 2012 , which chronicled her relationship with one of @entity69 's most notorious criminals			1
controversial : the former @entity24 , pictured in 1996 , sold her story about her life with him several times dramatised : payments included a consultant 's fee for the @entity98 drama @entity24 , made in 2012 ( pictured ) the payouts sparked an outcry and left a particularly bitter taste in the mouth of the @entity114 ' widow			1
he was the train driver who stopped to investigate rail signals which @entity1 ' gang had fixed , and was knocked out by an iron bar forcing him to give up work			1
he died seven years later			2
following an outcry over @entity122 ' cashing in ' on her husband 's crime the @entity123 sponsored a fund to help @entity128 's family , raising more than £ 34,000 by the time of his death			2
gesture : @entity1 a few months before his death at the funeral of the robbery 's mastermind @entity134 the former @entity24 insisted she was publicity - shy , and swore in an interview more than a decade ago that she would say her final public words about her ex-husband 's crime			1
' i was never that way inclined , ' she said at the time			2
' i was horrified that @entity143 had endangered our future happiness and the happiness of two little children by participating in it			0
' but once it had happened , i tried to do the right thing by him			0
' in one of her last interviews in 2012 , the former @entity24 - who reverted to her maiden name of @entity153 - said the train robber had ' abandoned ' her two sons to focus on his @entity48 child , @entity158			1
yet she still admitted she would ' probably do it all over again ' if she was given the chance			0
and she never truly found love again in the four decades after her divorce			0
' once you ’ve been through that , you do n’t lay yourself open to it again , ' she told @entity166			0
' you do n’t put your fate in somebody else ’s hands ever again			0
he was a hard act to follow			0
' the last time she met up with @entity1 was in @entity69 in 2009 , the year he was controversially granted compassionate release on health grounds			1
he had suffered several strokes and could only communicate using a letter board			0
' he saw that i had tears in my eyes , ' she said			0
' he pointed at himself and then his little board and spelt out the words " love " and then pointed at me			0
ms @entity4 died at @entity36 's @entity185 on december 11			1
she is survived by two sons and four grandchildren			0
the country was left stunned after a train was hijacked and robbed 35 miles from its @entity14 destination in august 1963			0
a 17 - strong gang launched the raid on the overnight service from @entity12 at the @entity194 in @entity82 , @entity83 in the early hours of august 8 in what has been dubbed the ' crime of the century '			2
led by the charismatic @entity134 , the group of criminals pulled off the notorious heist , making off with £ 2.6million - the equivalent of £ 40million today			0
the train was stopped at a set of fixed signals which the gang had switched , leading driver @entity114 to go and investigate			0
he was knocked out by an iron bar wielded by an unknown member of the gang , forcing him to give up work , and he died seven years later			0
following an outcry over @entity122 cashing in on her husband 's crime , the @entity123 sponsored a fund to help @entity128 's family , raising more than £ 34,000 by the time of his death			2
the bulk of the huge haul has never been recovered			0
the gang shared out the proceeds at isolated @entity222 taking around £ 148,000 - but thereafter things started to go badly wrong , with nearly all the gang members being rounded up by the police			0
in fact , the @entity227 hide - out was a huge mistake on the part of the gang			0
the police were telling reporters that they were looking for an isolated farm which had just changed hands and which was 25 miles from the scene of the crime			2
@entity238 met every one of these requirements			2
when the gang became aware that the police were hot on their scent , they quit the farm hurriedly , leaving behind scores of tell - tale fingerprints			0
most of the ringleaders were quickly rounded up , and 11 of the robbers got jail sentences ranging from 14 to 30 years .			0

@entity4 was just 17 when she met petty criminal @entity1 , then 27
she said first she knew of crime was when he came home with his loot
but she stuck by him , joining him after he fled to @entity35 and @entity36
@entity259 remained on good terms after he abandoned her and went to @entity48
she sold her story many times , including for @entity98 show @entity24 in 2012
