photographer @entity5 ( left , in an old photograph ) developed a delusional view of his relationship with shop assistant @entity8 ( right ) , 22 , after she served him in the @entity10 store , in @entity11 she told @entity25 that the first time she spoke to him he had handed her the envelope , which was addressed to her by first and second name , but she had never told him her second name and he had spelt it incorrectly			1
next time she saw him at her till he commented about the horse picture on her name badge and revealed that he knew she owned a grey horse , she said			0
' that really freaked me out because my horse is a dappled grey but i had no idea how he knew that , ' she said			0
' i tried to ignore it			0
when the transaction was finished he presented me with a piece of white paper when i gave him his receipt			2
' the paper had his contact details on it			0
i alerted my parents about him that night			0
' her third encounter with him was some weeks later in early february when she got a text from a colleague telling her a @entity53 card had arrived for her at work , she said			1
' when i got to work i saw the card and it said " @entity58 " on the envelope			2
it also said " the petite blonde girl , half @entity61			0
" ' i 'm not @entity61 so i do n't know where he got that from			0
although it said @entity65 i am the only petite blonde @entity35 in the store			0
' the card inside had a picture of rabbits in bed doing @entity71 knows what			2
i thought it was disgusting			2
the insinuation in that card made me feel sick to my stomach			2
' it had " i love you " written in pencil at the bottom of the card , ' a few days later , she said , she was told by her manager that @entity5 had made a complaint to @entity1 head office alleging he had heard staff calling her ' a mad b * tch ' and a ' little sl * t ' while reprimanding her			1
a court heard he had given her a calendar of his duck photographs at her checkout in an envelope with her name on , and had sent her a ' disgusting ' @entity21 card with rabbits on , telling her he ' loved her ' at the @entity1 store in @entity10 but there had never been any such incident , she said			1
she had never been reprimanded or abused at work			0
the court heard that in his letter to @entity105 said : ' we have been trying to date one another for six months without success and there are complex personal issues involved			0
' it was on hearing about his bizarre complaint that she called in the police and reported @entity5 for stalking , she said			2
@entity5 , who describes himself on his website as a photographer , desktop publisher and @entity123 translator , was prosecuted for harassing ms @entity8 between 1st dec 2013 and feb 4th 2014 and was convicted by magistrates earlier this year			1
but he appealed against his conviction to the crown court last friday and his appeal was allowed - although the court said it accepted ms @entity8 's evidence and rejected @entity5 's version of events			1
judge @entity132 said the court found @entity5 to be a ' delusional ' and fixated fantastist ' but his behaviour had not amounted to the legal definition of harassment or stalking			1
although the court allowed his appeal and quashed the harassment conviction it made a two year restraining order barring @entity5 from contacting ms @entity8 in any way or going within five metres of her when shopping at the @entity1			1
in evidence , @entity5 had claimed that ms @entity8 had once shouted at him loudly across the store suggesting he should ask her out on a date he claimed she had seen his name on his @entity148 and looked up his website			1
next time he saw her she told him she liked his photos of ducks so he took her the calendar , he said			2
he denied putting her surname on the calendar , saying he did not even know her name at that time			2
later , he said , she told him she was half @entity61 and when he put @entity156 on the @entity53 card it was just a guess at a @entity61 name			0
and he claimed he had heard an incident when she was being abused in the store and he found it ' genuinely alarming ' so he wrote to @entity1 to complain			2
@entity5 , was convicted for harassing ms @entity8			1
but he appealed against his conviction to @entity25 ( pictured ) and his appeal was allowed - although the court said it accepted ms @entity8 's evidence and rejected @entity5 's version of events @entity5 said her evidence about him talking to her about her horse was false and ' off the wall			1
' allowing the appeal @entity172 , who sat with two male magistrates , said : ' @entity8 is 22			1
' any objective observer would describe her undoubtedly as an extremely physically attractive young woman			0
the appellant , by contrast , is an ordinary looking man in his mid-fifties			0
that is not said to complain or condemn - it is just a statement of fact			0
' we found ms @entity8 to be a believable and compelling witness			1
' he said the court totally rejected @entity5 's claim he had heard ms @entity8 being called a b * tch or sl * t. ' it is impossible to understand how any member of staff could refer to her as a little sl * t , ' said the judge			1
' her demeanour and personality as we judge it is quite the opposite of that			0
' this was indicative of the appellant 's delusional view of his relationship with her			0
we unhesitatingly prefer her version of events wherever it differs from his			0
' however although we find that his conduct did result in fear and distress to ms @entity8 one could not properly say that this was persistent conduct of a severely oppressive nature			1
' what he has done is undoubtedly unattractive and unreasonable but does not cross the line into torment			0
for those reasons we allow his appeal			0
' we find him to be someone who has formed and who still has a completely irrational interest in this innocent young woman			0
' he denies being fixated by this young woman but we have come to the view that unless he is subject to a restraining order he is likely to subject her to further conduct which will amount to harassment			1

@entity5 , 56 , became fixated with shop assistant @entity8
gave her a calendar and a ' disgusting ' @entity21 card in @entity1 , @entity10
the card had ' i love you ' written in pencil at the bottom of it
he was initially prosecuted for harassing ms @entity8 between *december* 1 , 2013 and february 4 , 2014 and was convicted by magistrates this year
has now had conviction quashed on appeal at @entity25
instead he has restraining order barring him from contacting ms @entity8
