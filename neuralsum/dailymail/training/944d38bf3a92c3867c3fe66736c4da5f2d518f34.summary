lollipop man , @entity0 , 68 , with the camera fitted to his body lollipop men patrolling @entity5 ’s ' most dangerous school crossing ' are being fitted with cameras - after being knocked down by hit - and - run drivers a total of five times			1
the cameras were fitted to traffic monitors working outside @entity12 , @entity13 , this morning			1
the security measures have been introduced after lollipop man @entity15 , 41 , was ran over three times , while his colleague @entity0 , 64 , was hit twice in the last five months			1
the pair have also had to dive out of the way of several speeding cars after drivers refused to stop when they displayed their stop sign			1
@entity15 - who says he receives daily abuse from angry motorists - hopes the cameras can help reduce the number of reckless drivers who regularly speed through the two crossings			1
the shocking number of accidents has led the road outside the 330 - pupil school being branded ' @entity5 ’s most dangerous school crossing '			2
video footage of crashes or near misses will be used in court to prosecute dangerous drivers			2
@entity15 , from @entity13 , started wearing the chest - mounted camera today			1
he said : ' it ’s going to be a positive step - it ’s going to make children ’s lives safer and its going to make our jobs easier			2
' hopefully it will deter people from driving through and speeding but i do n’t actually see them stopping accidents			1
' there are two crossings near the school where @entity15 , who mans one of the crossings , was first hit by a car in may			0
one car hit him with such force his hand was shattered in two places , and the lollipop was ripped from his hand and flung into a tree by a driver who failed to stop			1
if you can read this , you 're too close : the camera is seen in operation on @entity0 's chest in september , @entity15 was hit from behind by another driver , who failed to stop while he helped pupils cross the road			0
his co-worker @entity74 added : ' the first time i got hit was when i went after a child in the @entity78 - it damaged my leg and i was off work for two weeks			2
' signs have also been put up to warn drivers about the recording equipment			0
@entity84 , from @entity85 , said : ' we are trialling these cameras to combat lollipop rage			2
' we are doing this for the protection of the children and the school crossing patrols , in an area that can be very dangerous			0
' we want to make sure that we prevent a child getting hurt in future			0
' safety first : parents take their children to @entity99 , under the protection of @entity0 dangerous : @entity99 is close to a busy road , where drivers regularly break the speed limit @entity84 added : ' we are hoping the measures we are taking in using the video equipment will never have to be used in court			1
' however , we are fully prepared that , should any driver endanger either the school crossing patrols or children , we will take all measures necessary to place that person before the courts			0
' we have never known a school patrolling crossing like this one			0
it has to be the worst			0
' the level of abuse @entity119 is receiving is terrible and drivers are simply not sticking to the rules			0
' we appreciate that people are busy and in a hurry to get to places but the driving of some people in this residential area is crazy			0

lollipop men at @entity99 in @entity13 hope cameras will deter drivers from speeding
