by @entity0 published : 05:46 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 06:30 est , 29 january 2013 prime minister @entity2 ’s partner - popularly known as the country ’s ‘ @entity3 ’ - has landed himself in hot water over a jokey comment he made while giving a lecture about prostate cancer			1
@entity9 told members of the @entity11 at the prime minister ’s home , @entity14 , in @entity15 that when being tested for the disease the best way was to ‘ look for a small female @entity19 doctor ’			1
he was suggesting that because the physical test involved a finger check a smaller hand would be more comfortable			1
@entity9 , partner of prime minister @entity2 , made a joke about prostrate exams that has landed him in hot water ‘ we can get a blood test for it but the digital examination is the only true way to get a correct reading on your prostate so make sure you go and do that and perhaps look for a small @entity19 female doctor is probably the best way , ’ he said to chuckles among the team			1
but one person was definitely not amused - @entity40 , who was present and who refused to join in the mirth			0
and today , a few hours after the remark , miss @entity2 admitted that mr @entity9 ’s comments were in poor taste			1
after he had apologised , miss @entity2 said he had done the right thing to say he was sorry – but defended his commitment to men ’s health causes			2
‘ he did his best to persuade notoriously reluctant men to get health checks , ’ said miss @entity2 , who had simply stared at him from behind his back as he made what he thought was an amusing statement			0
‘ it ’s important to get that message across ’ she told @entity55			0
‘ obviously , there ’s various ways of getting that message across but he ’ s certainly acknowledged that the joke cracked last night was in poor taste			1
’ miss @entity2 told @entity64 radio : ' he 's certainly acknowledged that the joke cracked last night was in poor taste ' mr @entity9 , 55 , a real estate agent and former hairdresser who has been miss @entity2 ’s partner since 2006 , said today that his remarks were aimed at raising awareness about prostate cancer and the need for men to get regular checks			1
a supporter of the @entity75 of @entity64 and a volunteer ambassador for the @entity77 – a male support group - mr @entity9 admitted today that he had got it wrong			2
‘ it was meant as a joke and on reflection i accept it was in poor taste , ’ he said in a brief statement issued by the prime minister ’s office			1
‘ i apologise for any offence caused ’ shadow attorney general @entity87 said mr @entity9 was lucky he did n’t tell his joke after an anti-discrimination bill – currently before parliament - became law			0
‘ if he did , he ’d probably have been carted away to the re-education camp by the thought police , ’ senator @entity87 told @entity92 , adding that the joke was in poor taste			2
radio host @entity96 said it was ironic that mr @entity9 should have made a comment that would be offensive to @entity19 women after miss @entity2 had last year accused the leader of the @entity103 opposition , @entity104 , of being a misogynist			2
the couple , who have been together since 2006 , met prince @entity107 at the @entity108 in 2011 mr @entity109 , @entity110 ’s parliamentary secretary , said that while mr @entity9 had been a tireless promoter of men ’s health issues , the joke would have been better left unsaid			0
‘ it ’s a poor choice of words , ’ he told @entity92			0
social media commentators were divided over whether the comment was tasteless			0
@entity118 wrote on @entity119 that ‘ @entity9 ’s comment was dumb but at least it ’s got everyone talking about prostate exams			2
’ another commentator wrote : ‘ i ’m offended by @entity9 ’s allegedly sexist / racist joke			0
@entity125 to take him to a @entity2 - approved kangaroo court ? ’ a supporter of mr @entity130 ’s comment wrote that it was ‘ not offensive at all , and if it makes just one bloke book a prostate exam , then the exercise has been worthwhile			0

@entity9 joked smaller hands make the physical test more *bearable*
the *pm* 's partner was talking to the @entity11
@entity2 admitted the comments were in ' poor taste '
