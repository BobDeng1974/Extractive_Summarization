but pity the neighbours of this man , who , not content with a simple skylight , added two whole houses on top of his factory			0
and is if that was n't bad enough , the red - brick villas are supported only by flimsy looking concrete stilts			2
now that 's what i call a loft extension ! @entity23 businessman has added two villas to the top of his three storey factory the two villas are a mirror image of one another and are supported by only thin concrete stilts these astonishing pictures from @entity30 , in @entity31 , southern @entity3 , show the results of an ambitious building project by one @entity23 businessman			1
incredibly the man actually got planning permission from the local authority to build on top of the original three - storey grey building , and residents claim the extension has been in place for years			1
however , following media attention and a careful look at the property , planning officers have decided that the end result does n't quite match the blueprints which were submitted			1
video source @entity49 incredibly the man actually got planning permission though planning officers say the results do n't match the blueprints they have ordered the dangerous structures to be torn down , warning that they could fall into the factory below			1
in a statement they said : ' they were built without permission and they will be demolished before they can fall down			2
' these ' chateaus in the clouds ' join a growing list of illegal @entity69 jobs that have capped city high - rises throughout @entity3 , such as the mountaintop villa in @entity72			2
workers have now demolished a @entity72 roof - top mountain villa after residents of the 26 - storey apartment block complained of cracked walls and damaged pipes professor @entity79 built the 8,610 square - foot structure on top of a 26 - storey apartment block without permission and was ordered to tear it down in august			0
residents said that there was only a small loft apartment there when he bought it , but he quickly installed a rock garden , swimming pool and villa in its place			0
@entity92 complained of cracks in their walls and leaking pipes caused by the extra weight .			0

@entity23 businessman actually got planning permission
