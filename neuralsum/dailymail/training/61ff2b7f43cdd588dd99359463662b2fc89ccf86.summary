by @entity0 , @entity1 on sunday political correspondent published : 16:03 est , 25 may 2013 updated : 16:03 est , 25 may 2013 @entity3 is mounting a drive to recruit @entity6 supporters from ‘ white , working - class ’ @entity8 voters who feel abandoned by @entity10 ’s party			1
the @entity6 leader – whose surge in the opinion polls has been put down to defections by disenchanted @entity16 supporters – will unveil his new strategy in a party political broadcast next sunday			1
the film will show his deputy , @entity20 , touring @entity8 ’s inner - city heartlands asking locals if they agree with @entity6 policies such as withdrawing from the @entity24 – and being given an enthusiastic reception			2
drive : @entity6 leader @entity26 mounting a drive to recruit @entity6 supporters from ' white , working - class ' @entity8 voters who feel abandoned by @entity10 's party mr @entity3 ’s strategists say the traditional dividing lines between the parties are becoming blurred , with @entity8 supporters just as likely to sympathise with the call for tighter restrictions on immigration			1
although the broadcast , to be shown on @entity39 , was filmed on monday , two days before the @entity37 murder , it will revive the debate about the political impact of the social tensions that can exist in some urban areas where growing ethnic minority communities co-exist with long - established populations of white @entity47 locals			2
following @entity6 ’s dramatic breakthrough in the local elections earlier this month – mr @entity3 won 23 per cent of the vote , just two per cent behind the conservatives and five per cent behind mr @entity10 – labour backbenchers have joined their @entity16 counterparts in calling for action to tackle the @entity6 threat			0
@entity56 , @entity8 mp for @entity57 , @entity58 , said his party should ‘ wake up and get real on immigration ’ , adding : ‘ too many employers are underpaying @entity47 workers and using cheap labour from abroad			1
’ the @entity6 film was produced by @entity65 – the wife of @entity8 mp @entity66 – who makes the @entity39 broadcasts for all the political parties			1
last night , ms @entity65 said she found the new @entity6 strategy ‘ fascinating ’			0
breakthough : @entity6 won 23 per cent of the vote , just five per cent behind @entity10 and @entity8 backbenchers have called for action to tackle the @entity6 threat ‘ with my non-political producer ’s hat on , i thought it was very interesting that @entity6 thinks there are votes to be had from the white working classes – although they do n’t express it in quite those terms – who feel that they have been failed by @entity8			2
‘ everywhere we went in this very @entity8 , inner - city @entity86 area , people said to @entity88 , “ you ’ve got my vote			0
” and they all , without exception , said they wanted to leave the @entity24			0
‘ i said to @entity94 that it was like the 1980s , under @entity96 , when everyone would come up to us and say , “ you ’ve got my vote			0
” ’ yesterday , as if to emphasise the point , a @entity8 councillor on mr @entity66 ’s own turf defected to @entity6			1
@entity102 councillor @entity101 said : ‘ i could n’t stay with @entity8 any longer			0
i agree with most of the policies that @entity6 have and i think it is a fairer party			0
’ mr @entity3 recently pledged to ‘ gun for @entity8 ’ because of mr @entity10 ’s ‘ abject ’ refusal to back a nationwide in / out ballot on the @entity24 .			2
