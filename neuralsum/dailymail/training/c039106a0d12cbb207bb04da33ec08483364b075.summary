by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:55 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:42 est , 12 december 2013 a @entity4 scientist has spotted a strange object that he has named ‘ @entity9 ’ in one of @entity8 ’s rings			1
astronomers are baffled by what the ring might be , but one theory suggests it could be the beginnings of a new moon			1
in a talk at @entity19 this week , professor @entity16 of @entity17 said he noticed a strange bend when poring over images on from @entity24 ’s @entity23 spacecraft			1
the thin , outermost ring shown in this picture from the @entity23 probe is @entity8 's f ring , and the bright dot near it is the @entity31			2
the thicker white band is the a ring			2
the smudge near what looks like the tip of that ring was created by @entity9 the mysterious object , which was located at the right edge of @entity8 ’s a ring , has been named ‘ @entity9 ’ after professor @entity16 ’s mother - in - law , according to a report by @entity44 in @entity45			1
@entity9 is thought to be about a 0.6 miles ( 1km ) in diameter , which experts claim is too small for it to be a moon			1
it could , however , be the build - up of ring material that has collapsed gravitationally under its own weight			1
@entity8 is known to have of 53 natural with two orbiting within gaps in the main rings launched in 1997 , @entity23 has been exploring @entity8 and its series of moons since 2004			0
on @entity8 , a full year is the equivalent to 30 @entity59 years , meaning @entity23 has only been able to observe a third of a @entity8 year			0
since 2004 , @entity8 and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer			0
@entity23 has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving there in 2004 , also observing @entity66 , the heliosphere , and testing the theory of relativity @entity23 is the fourth space probe to visit @entity8 and the first to enter orbit , and its mission is on going as of 2013			0
some of @entity8 ’s moons , particularly those orbiting near the rings , are thought to have formed in this way , creating a ring of dust then collecting more material to grow			1
the planet is known to have of 53 natural with two orbiting within gaps in the main rings			0
some moons , such as @entity82 and @entity83 , interact with ring material , shepherding the ring in its orbit			1
after his initial discovery , professor @entity16 took a look 107 @entity23 images taken since 2012 and claims it 's possible to see a smudge made by the object in many of them			1
the @entity23 team is particularly interested to see what happens to @entity9 next month , when gravitational interactions will cause the a ring to expand			2
last year , hundreds of objects up to half a mile in diameter were caught on camera wreaking havoc with one of @entity8 ’s rings			2
last year , hundreds of objects up to half a mile in diameter were caught on camera wreaking havoc with one of @entity8 's rings			2
from left to right in the top row , the trails in these images are 18 , 85 and 96 miles long			0
in the bottom row from left to right , the trails are 43 , 129 and 32 miles long the objects were actually snowballs created by some of @entity8 ’s 60 moons , like @entity82			0
they were snapped punching through @entity8 ’s f ring , the outermost of the planet 's main rings , with a radius of about 87,000 miles			0
at the time of the discovery , professor @entity16 said , ‘ i think the f ring is @entity8 's weirdest ring , and these latest @entity23 results go to show how the f ring is even more dynamic than we ever thought			1
’ launched in 1997 , @entity23 has been exploring @entity8 and its series of moons since 2004			0
on @entity8 , a full year is the equivalent to 30 @entity59 years , meaning @entity23 has only been able to observe a third of a @entity8 year .			0

professor @entity16 named the object @entity9 after his mother - in - law
it is thought to be kilometre in diameter - too small to be a moon
experts , however , believe it could be the beginnings of a new moon
if this is the case , it is being formed *due* to the build - up of ring material that has collapsed under its own weight
