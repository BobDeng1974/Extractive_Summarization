' to boldly go ' : @entity0 as @entity2 captain @entity1 , who explored space in the original series of @entity5 as captain @entity1 he was ready to boldly go where no man has gone before			1
but it 's been claimed that @entity0 turned down the chance to travel into space aboard @entity11 's spaceship two because he 's scared of flying			1
virgin tycoon sir @entity12 said he offered the original @entity5 star the opportunity to be among the first extraterrestrial tourists because of his links with space			1
but the billionaire said the 82 - year - old @entity19 actor turned down the offer because he 's scared to take to the skies			2
' he actually said he 's frightened of airline travel - which is slightly disillusioning			0
captain @entity1 is scared of flying , ' the @entity23 quoted sir @entity12 as saying			1
but @entity0 , who played the all - action , alien - romancing captain of the starship enterprise in 79 episodes of the original @entity32 series and seven subsequent @entity5 films , has a slightly different story			1
after he was given an honorary doctorate of @entity36 at his alma mater , @entity38 ’s @entity37 , in 2011 , he told reporters that sir @entity12 had expected him to foot the £ 125,000 ( $ 200,000 ) bill			1

' he wanted me to go up and pay for it and i said : " hey , you pay me and i ’ll go up			2
i ’ll risk my life for a large sum of money			0
" but he did n’t pick me up on my offer			0
' that was n't the first time he had indicated his reluctance to be blasted into the unknown			0
five years earlier @entity0 said : ' i 'm interested in man 's march into the unknown but to vomit in space is not my idea of a good time			2
' neither is a fiery crash with the vomit hovering over me			0
' according to sir @entity12 , 63 , rockers @entity63 are the latest big names to enquire about joining him on his pioneering flight			1
but he added that they too would have to find the cash for their fares			0
' we have a policy that however famous people are they wo n't get upgrades or freebies , ' he said , adding that he thought @entity63 would be able to afford tickets			0
' slightly disillusioning ' : sir @entity12 , left , said @entity0 , right , now 82 , had told him he 's even afraid of airline travel			1
@entity0 two years ago said @entity11 should be paying him to take part in such a risky adventure the @entity80 : the spacecraft , also known as the @entity82 in homage to @entity5 , earlier this month carried out its second powered test flight			1
