by @entity0 , political correspondent and @entity2 , @entity3 political editor @entity6 leader @entity5 appeared in a video promoting ‘ remarkable ’ e-cigarettes after his party received £ 25,000 from a @entity11 manufacturer of the alternatives to tobacco , it emerged today			1
in the 90 - second film , smoker mr @entity5 is seen puffing on a large refillable e-cigarette , declaring ‘ as a smoker , frankly i have n’t yet given up but i could do very easily ’			1
it came just seven months after the makers of @entity19 wicked e-cigarettes gave @entity6 tens of thousands of pounds , but today the firm told @entity3 it wished it had made donations to other political parties instead			1
@entity38 , the founder of @entity34 who stepped down in june , also donated £ 11,000 as an individual on july 21 , 2013			1
the company says it gave the money at the time because it thought @entity6 was the only party making any attempt to oppose @entity45 moves to ban refillable e-cigarettes outright			1
there was no connection between the donation and the video , @entity47 said			2
as the @entity45 ’s plans were being finalised in mid-december , mr @entity5 appeared in the video , posted on the @entity55 page of the @entity56 of the @entity57			1
‘ well , there is no end to the interference , ’ he says , complaining of a meeting in @entity59 between officials and @entity61 on the subject of e-cigarettes			2
puffing on a smaller e-cigarette , he tells the camera : ‘ they are going allow these little ones , mostly made by the giant pharmaceutical lobby and by big tobacco			1
‘ but into this vacuum there have been a whole host of entrepreneurs producing these kind of things with refillables , ’ he adds , before picking up a larger e-cigarette shaped like a cigar			2
‘ these things are remarkable , ’ he declares			0
‘ let me show you			0
’ as his face is obscured by ‘ smoke ’ vapour , mr @entity5 puffs away and tells viewers : ‘ i have to say , as a smoker , frankly i have n’t yet given up but i could do very easily			0
‘ and there are 1.8million people in @entity11 that are using these things			0
it is cutting down tobacco consumption massively			0
‘ it is spawning a whole new industry and yet these refillable , larger e-cigarettes are now due to be banned			2
‘ i want to see the @entity11 government stand up and say we under no circumstances will accept this			0
will they ? i am not so sure			0
’ the @entity101 eventually agreed that to cap the amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes , allowing a nicotine level of 200mg in a 10ml refillable e-cigarette container , instead of banning them outright			2
the video has raised questions about links between the £ 25,000 donation – its sixth largest of 2013 – and its policy on e-cigarettes			1
@entity114 38 , which manufactures totally wicked refillable e-cigarettes , gave @entity6 £ 25,000 in may last year @entity116 , a @entity117 @entity61 , told the ft : ‘ while mr @entity5 is free to promote any product he likes , it is worth bearing in mind that this video sees him marketing a product from an industry which gave his party £ 25,000 last year			1
‘ considering @entity6 ’s dismal record in actually turning up to the @entity57 , it ’s astounding just how much time and effort the party has put into opposing legislation on e-cigarettes			1
’ mr @entity5 also threw his weight behind e-cigarettes in a newspaper column on december 2			0
writing in @entity136 , he said : ‘ as i ’m sure many people realise , i am quite a keen smoker			0
i ’ve always prized myself on being rather good at it			0
green mep @entity116 raised questions about the donation ‘ but when a couple of old friends who have been smoking several packets a day for decades tell me that they have n’t touched a cigarette in a month because they ’ve been using these new e-cigarette products it made even me want to try them out			1
‘ and i tell you what ; they work much better than any of the stop - smoking products which have been on the market for years			2
’ today mr @entity5 defended the video : ' @entity6 have supported the freedom to smoke e-cigarettes for a very long time			1
i have been extremely careful on the issue of donations and only accepted these because the public position of @entity6 on @entity161 was already very clear			2
' a @entity6 spokesman added : ' @entity5 has always been campaigning on this type of thing			2
' the only response we ’re giving is that @entity5 is well known for his libertarian views on such matters			0
' @entity169 , who took over from his brother @entity170 as chief executive of @entity34 last year , said there was no link between the donation and the video			1
at the time of the donation ‘ the only party who seemed to be making any noise on this issue was @entity6 ’ , he said			1
mr @entity38 told @entity3 : ‘ other parties and @entity61 have done a sterling job since then			0
it was probably not the wisest thing to do			0
’ he said conservative mep @entity185 and @entity187 @entity186 had done more to stand up for users of e-cigarettes			0
‘ there are certainly @entity61 of different political parties who i would have wanted to provide support to			0
‘ if i had £ 25,000 to donate today and i had to give it to a party it would n’t have been to @entity6			1
‘ it would have been to the @entity198 and @entity187 , certain @entity61 , in isolation , [ who ] have been acting independently			0
’ @entity34 has no plans to make future political donations , mr @entity38 added .			1
