a website called @entity1 that rates city neighborhoods so users know which areas to avoid has launched and its name alone has already caused a pr nightmare			1
the startup was n’t trying to be funny when it introduced its beta site on tuesday , but just a day after @entity10 caught wind of it they unceremoniously changed the site ’s name			1
though its creators have rechristened @entity1 as @entity19 with a new website , even that 's now been taken down amidst accusations of classism , racism , and insensitivity			1
racist ? @entity25 allowed users to rate an area 's safety			0
using those ratings , the site would dub the poorly rated neighborhoods ' ghetto ' in bold red ‘ if your goal was to inspire 100 " what 's wrong with tech " articles , you named this perfectly , ’ wrote prescient @entity10 contributor bendoernberg			1
‘ i would highly recommend changing the name and addressing the problematic aspects of red - lining neighborhoods before you get absolutely hammered by a million bloggers			0
’ when a user looks up a neighborhood , a red warning of ‘ ghetto ’ pops up in areas that have been unfavorably rated by ‘ locals and people familiar with the area , ’ according to the site ’s now - removed ‘ about ’ page			1
this has led many to accuse the site of being not just classist and uncouth , but also racist			1
‘ they should simply geotag by ethnicity and save people the need to subjectively " rate " certain areas , ’ wrote @entity60			0
profile : the site 's interface , while it still had one , asked for an area or business			2
if the the place had been rated poorly by users , it displayed as a red dot on a map with the word ghetto @entity78 ? ironically , the app may not have even worked			0
one of the neighborhoods , ranked as ' ghetto ' was @entity78 in @entity82 ( pictured ) writer @entity83 at @entity84 agreed			0
‘ it ’s pretty detrimental to society when we reinforce the idea that poor or crime - heavy areas are places to be categorically avoided or shamed , ’ wrote @entity83 in a piece titled @entity86 is the worst site on the @entity94			2
@entity83 asked @entity1 is the whole thing was a joke			1
‘ this was originally seriously developed as a travel tool and the name " @entity1 " was meant to be something that people would remember , ’ replied an unnamed person at the website			1
‘ well , it worked , but unfortunately , it appears to have brought a lot of negative baggage along with it			0
’ the source at the website formerly known as @entity25 , who refuses to be named , said the site was supposed to be ‘ both a satire and functional at the same			2
’ @entity112 's @entity111 and its owner @entity113 have been identified in a @entity115 post as the programmers behind the site , but @entity113 maintains he was merely hired to build the site			2
@entity120 nightmare : after a backlash that began just two days after reports of its existence surfaced , @entity25 was redubbed good part of @entity126			1
its side look like this , though even that 's now been taken down however , the backlash proves most people took it seriously			2
by wednesday , just one day after word of the app first spread , @entity25 was redubbed good part of @entity126			1
a stock photo of a white family was replaced by a black family			0
that site was also quickly shuttered			2
the site read ‘ coming soon , ’ and beside the title was a @entity144 video of a clip from @entity146 wherein a white family is terrified as they drive through a crime - riddled neighborhood			0
now , the site is all but empty			0
‘ need advice on an area , ’ it asks atop a list of unused discussion threads			0
‘ ask a local ! ’			0

just a day after its introduction , @entity1 faced a *public* relations backlash
the startup has taken its site *offline* and changed its name to good part of @entity126
