in an interview with @entity14 ’s @entity13 programme , dr @entity10 revealed what turned him from the corrections commissioner for the @entity7 @entity17 to a passionate anti-death penalty campaigner			1
‘ i still have nightmares , ’ dr @entity10 said in the interview			2
@entity10 , the former commissioner of corrections for the @entity17 talked about his experience overseeing executions at the prison ' i have spent a lifetime ... regretting every moment and every killing ' : in a heartfelt interview with @entity13 , @entity10 opened up about the five executions he oversaw ‘ although it is state - sanctioned , it is by every definition premeditated murder … it ’s the most premeditated form of murder you can possibly imagine and it stays in your psyche forever			1
’ dr @entity10 is a trained psychologist who began working in the prison system in order to help and rehabilitate people , but a promotion to the position of corrections commissioner meant the responsibility for overseeing the state ’s executions fell to him			1
during his time at the prison in the early 1990s , dr @entity10 supervised the five executions			1
the first two executed were @entity52 and @entity53 , who were accused of a brutal rape and murder in 1977			2
at the time of the murder @entity52 was 17 with a borderline mental impairment			0
he spent 17 years on death row during which time he got an education , received counselling and changed dramatically			0
‘ he was a different human being , ’ said dr @entity10 , who added that @entity52 felt enormous remorse for his crime and his last words were ' please forgive me '			2
those under dr @entity10 ’s supervision were killed on the electric chair , a method of execution that was outlawed in the @entity17 in 2001 after the @entity72 ruled it was a cruel and unusual punishment			1
the state now uses lethal injection			0
dr @entity10 described watching @entity52 ’s death			1
‘ we could see the jolt of electricity running through this individual ’s body			0
snapped his head back and then there was just total silence			0
and i knew i had killed another human being			0
’ executions at the @entity17 prison were carried out by electric chair , a method that was ruled to be ' cruel and unusual punishment ' by the @entity17 @entity72 in 2001 he said that the executions were ‘ a small part of the job , ’ which also involved supervising 15,000 employees and managing the prison , but it was the part of the job that has continued to haunt him			2
‘ i have spent a lifetime since then regretting every moment and every killing , ’ he said in the interview			0
‘ i was the vehicle for the execution and i have no defence for that			0
’ dr @entity10 resigned from his position in 1995 , but by then ‘ it was too late '			1

another execution that has stayed with dr @entity131 was that of @entity112 , a black man convicted of murdering three women			0
after the trial , one black member of the jury described the atmosphere among the majority white jury as one of racial intimidation , with one white juror saying that the execution would leave ‘ one less n * * * * r to breed			0
’ despite this , and the fact that @entity112 ’s iq was so low that some experts believed he was not competent to enter a plea , @entity112 was executed under dr @entity10 ’s supervision			2
dr @entity10 says there is definitely a racial dimension to executions			1
‘ black people who kill whites are about three times more likely to receive the death penalty than the other way round			2
’ @entity17 is one of 32 states in which the death penalty is legal			1
last year there were 39 executions in the @entity7 and there have been eight so far in 2014 .			1
