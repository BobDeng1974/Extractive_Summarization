by @entity0 published : 03:48 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 06:33 est , 3 may 2013 two blind friends have been told they ca n't go on holiday to @entity3 together just two weeks before they were due to fly because they need a carer			1
@entity5 , 27 , and @entity6 , 24 , were told by @entity7 that they must take someone with them because they wo n't be able to see the in - flight safety demonstration			1
@entity5 was looking forward to the break at the the luxury @entity13 resort as she recovers from a gruelling 11 - hour operation and prepares for her next stint in hospital			1
she was so excited about her holiday that she had already bought all her holiday clothes , booked in to have her hair done and got her euros			2
holiday ban : @entity5 , 27 , and @entity6 , 24 , who have been told they ca n't go on their @entity7 flight because they ca n't see no go : @entity5 , 27 , and @entity6 , 24 , were told by @entity7 it was n't safe for them to fly because they are blind they booked the break in january and were due to fly from @entity32 to @entity33 on may 8 but were told last week they could n't go			1
miss @entity5 , of @entity35 , @entity36 , said : ' it 's just not fair			1
they would n't accept any kind of compromise			2
' i 'm absolutely gutted			2
they said we can go if we take someone sighted but that 's not the point			0
it was my first holiday without my mother so i was really excited - no parents			2
' i 've already changed my money and the company gave me our tickets			0
' miss @entity55 suffered mid-facial disfigurement in the womb because of complications with her mother 's pregnancy when hormones stopped being produced			0
the condition , which is genetic , left @entity5 blind from birth			1
it is so rare that it is known to affect just 23 people in the world and does n't have a name			2
however , she has bravely overcome her disability and is studying psychotherapy at @entity72			0
her mother @entity73 , 50 , said she flagged up her daughter and @entity6 's condition when she booked the £ 538 five - night half - board holiday			1
it was only when they filled out a disability form in late april that the company backtracked and said they ca n't go			1
anger : @entity5 , 27 , who has had a series of operations , had already got her travel money and had been issued with her tickets for the holiday when she was told she would n't be able to go without a carer mrs @entity5 said : ' it is absolutely disgusting			1
they have been looking forward to this so much			0
' @entity5 and @entity6 , from @entity91 , were told that they would not know how to put on a life jacket or an oxygen mask			1
but she said : ' i have spoken to other blind people who said they were shown how to put on the life jacket and explained the plane instructions before they even boarded			0
so what is it about us that means they ca n't ? ' @entity103 , campaigns officer for the @entity104 said that by law companies like @entity7 have to work to accommodate those who ca n't see			1
mother 's anger : @entity73 , 50 , said she flagged up her daughter 's condition when she booked the holiday ' while we ca n't comment on individual cases , we are most concerned by @entity7 's apparently negative attitude towards their blind customers , ' she said			1
' blind and partially sighted people deserve to book holidays and take flights like every other customer			0
' why should those with sight loss miss out on their holidays , or travelling for business , simply because companies are failing to take accessibility standards seriously ? ' the law requires airlines and holiday companies to explore alternatives when dealing with customers who require extra assistance , and they are supposed to consider this at the time of booking			0
' a spokesman for the @entity139 said that blind passengers do not need a chaperone - although airlines can refuse to carry people if for safety reasons			2
' we would always want to see airlines engaging with their passengers at the start of the booking process , so the passengers have the opportunity to let the airline know about any support they need , and the airline has the time to make the necessary arrangements			0
' blind passengers are not required by the regulation to travel with a companion			0
this is very much dependent on the exact nature of their needs , but the airline should work closely with them to identify what support the passenger requires			0
' if passengers with reduced mobility are unhappy with the service they have received from their airline , they can refer their complaint to the @entity139			0
' a @entity7 spokesman said : ' @entity7 is sorry to hear of ms @entity5 ’s disappointment at not being able to travel to @entity3			1
' both ms @entity5 and her partner completed a special assistance form , in which they stated they would need assistance to complete a number of safety related actions , such as putting on a lifejacket , on board the aircraft			2
' these requirements are taken from the @entity188 ’s @entity187 that has been confirmed by the @entity190 @entity139 , to which @entity7 and every other @entity190 airline must adhere			0
' unfortunately , as ms @entity5 and her partner are not able to complete these without assistance , we are not able to allow them to travel unaccompanied			2
' we have therefore offered ms @entity5 a full refund or the option to add a passenger to her booking who could assist her and her partner on their trip			1
' ' @entity7 takes its responsibilities with regards to our customers ’ welfare seriously			0
our shop staff give customers the information they need to make a decision on which hotel and destination best suits their needs			0
