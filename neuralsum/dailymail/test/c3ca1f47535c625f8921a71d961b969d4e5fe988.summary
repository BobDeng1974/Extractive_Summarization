victim : @entity44 ( pictured ) is one of the two men @entity10 was found guilty of killing			1
she admitted to shooting @entity44 when she found him being attacked by her pigs in 2013 , but jurors did n't buy the story @entity10 's changing stories about how she shot @entity43 and @entity44 never matched the forensic evidence , @entity57 , senior assistant deputy district attorney , told jurors in closing arguments			1
