by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 today brushed aside claims the government sold the @entity4 on the cheap , insisting @entity5 who was put in charge ‘ is not a sort of share price expert ’			1
it came after the revelation that the firm ’s privatisation at a knock down price cost the taxpayer £ 1billion , worth £ 55 for every family in @entity16			2
amid growing concerns shares were sold too cheaply , freedom of information requests revealed that 21 banks pitching to work on the floatation had valued the @entity4 from £ 4bn to £ 4.8bn - well above the eventual sale price of £ 3.3bilion			1
sold too low : 21 banks pitching to work on the floatation had valued the @entity4 from £ 4bn to £ 4.8bn - well above the eventual sale price of £ 3.3bilion it means the 60 per cent stake sold by @entity24 , the business secretary , raised £ 2billion , instead of the £ 2.9billion he was told he could have secured for the taxpayer			1
the new figures prompted fresh accusations that the @entity16 ’s historic postal service was privatised too cheaply at the taxpayer ’s expense during a period of unprecedented austerity			1
@entity35 , @entity36 ’s shadow business secretary who unearthed them , said the government ’s failure to get a fair price for @entity4 had ‘ left taxpayers short - changed ’			1
but mr @entity2 leapt to his @entity43 colleague 's defence			0
speaking on his @entity46 phone - in , the deputy prime minister said : ' @entity5 is not a sort of share price expert			0
he is the secretary of state who is responsible for this who i think very bravely did something ... ‘ what i dispute is this idea that somehow @entity5 single handedly plucked some arbitrary price out of thin air			0
they did it following advice			0
‘ it ’s clearly an imprecise , unpredictable science			0
it is a good thing that this company is now being valued as a very good , strong company because that ’s vital			0
‘ any government when selling a company like that , floating a company like that has got to take independent advice			0
that is what we ’ve done and that is what the @entity72 , in this case , @entity5 , did			0
’ the government floated 60 per cent of @entity4 in october at 330p a share , valuing it at £ 3.3bn and raising almost £ 2bn for the public purse			1
shares went up by more than a third on the first day of trading alone , and broke through the 550p mark within a week			0
business secretary mr @entity5 tried to suggest that the price increase was mere ‘ froth ’ , but yesterday the shares were still being traded at 585p			1
deputy prime minister @entity2 , who was presented with a portrait of himself during his @entity46 phone - in , insisted @entity5 was not a share price expert but listened to advice a report into the sale process of the @entity4 is expected to be published by the commons business select committee in the next few weeks and the @entity91 is also investigating			1
the new figures support previous claims the sale was ‘ catastrophically ’ undervalued			0
conservative think tank @entity97 suggested in november taxpayers might have lost @entity99 accused ministers of masterminding a privatisation that ‘ robbed the taxpayer ’ and said shares had been undervalued possibly by as much as £ 1billion			2
@entity104 , chairman of the group , said at the time : ‘ you can sell £ 10 notes for £ 5 all day long and call it a success			0
but this is robbing the overtaxed @entity112 in a short - sighted fire sale of a valuable national asset			1
there are currently restrictions in place on further sales of the remaining 30 per cent of shares , 10 per cent having been given to @entity4 staff			2
the remainder of the shares are likely to be sold in tranches after april when the restrictions are lifted			0
@entity35 said the government 's failure to get a fair price ' left taxpayers short - changed ' the figures show that in may 2013 top - end valuations were as high as £ 8.7 billion			1
but by the autumn , after research was completed into investor demand , amid threats of @entity4 strikes and fears of a @entity137 debt default , several experts told select committee hearings these ‘ desk - top valuations ’ could not be compared			2
but estimates were still markedly higher than the eventual share price of 330p			0
@entity143 and @entity144 , the lead banks in the floatation , said that was the maximum that institutional investors would pay without starting to drop out			2
even so , ministers and advisers considered raising the price by 20p in the days before the flotation , but feared it would put the sale at risk of failure			0
business secretary @entity157 said : ' we carried out a successful sale that secured almost £ 2bn for the taxpayer and longterm investors in @entity4			1
we still own a 30 per cent stake in the company and the subsequent rise in the trading price of shares in @entity4 ensures that taxpayers continue to benefit from any strengthening in the share price			2
' at prime minister ’s questions earlier this week , mr @entity170 said the government ' did a good job to get private sector capital into @entity4 '			1
last night mr @entity35 said the pm had ' serious questions to answer about why his government sold off @entity4 on the cheap ' .			1

21 banks pitching to work on @entity4 floatation put value over £ *4billion*
but the postal service was eventually sold and privatised at just £ 3.3 billion
@entity36 's shadow business secretary says taxpayers were ' short - changed '
@entity35 says government still has ' serious questions to answer '
