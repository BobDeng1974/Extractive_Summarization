dr @entity1 said modern medicine treats patients as ‘ conditions rather than people ’ and urged doctors to stop practising ‘ medicine by body part ’ which leads to the over-prescribing of many drugs			1

speaking at charity @entity29 ’s for later life conference , dr @entity1 , who is lead adviser for preventable dementia in @entity26 , said : ‘ lots of medicine is starting to lose its way			1
it ’s become far more reductionist – we practise medicine by body part			0
‘ we end up treating conditions on their own			2
' so somebody with diabetes and dementia , who has had a stroke , has a mixture of 12 , 15 or 18 drugs to take in a day and it is very difficult to do that			0

he said : ‘ most people who are put on medication for long - term conditions are very rarely on the same medication a year later because they have stopped taking them , because every normal person would if they ’re on 18 drugs a day , because there is very little time to do anything else			2

‘ try to learn something every day ; try to help somebody else around you and be aware of your surroundings			0
that ’s all you need to do			0
