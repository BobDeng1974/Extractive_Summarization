and the occasion went without a hitch , despite some initial reservations from the registrar			1
@entity11 , 60 , said : ' when we tried to book for quarter past we were told we had to choose 2pm or 2.30pm			2
so we went for 2.30pm and planned to turn up early			1
auspicious : @entity2 and @entity3 picked the date and time to set up a unique numerical progression on their special day ' it was n't until five weeks ago when we were speaking to our registrar and she asked us about the time that we got it sorted			1
once we explained she said it would n't be a problem			2
' we 'd like to thank the registrar for being so understanding and letting us do it			2
' @entity23 , 47 , said : ' it 's one you wo n't forget			0

' @entity33 , the best man , was behind the idea of the quarter past two ceremony			1

it 's just obvious is n't it ? ' the ceremony and reception , for 65 people , was held at @entity46 on @entity47 in @entity48			0
thankful : the couple , from @entity50 , were delighted that the registrar agreed to hold their wedding at the slightly unusual time of 2.15pm when asked about pre-wedding jitters , the groom said : ' i was n't at all nervous until this morning but i do have a jippy tummy now			1
it 's alright for @entity23 , because she has to get ready and get her hair done , so she 's occupied , i 've just got to wait around			0
and i 've gone and forgot my book ! ' last night i stayed in the room @entity23 and the bridesmaids will be getting ready in and was threatened with serious injury not to look at the dresses			0
' @entity23 added : ' i 'm relieved now we 've had the service			0
i was n't really nervous before but i 'm just relieved everything has gone without a hitch			0
