by @entity0 published : 06:43 est , 18 august 2012 updated : 15:37 est , 18 august 2012 tragic : @entity1 never stopped her fight to find her son 's body @entity1 , the mother of moors murder victim @entity7 never stopped her fight to find her son 's body and vowed to keep on searching ' until the end of her days			1
' but this morning , after a 48 - year campaign , she tragically died in a @entity14 hospice after battling cancer			1
the last time @entity1 saw her 12 - year - old son @entity16 was when he waved goodbye as he walked to his grandmother ’s house in @entity19 , @entity14 , on june 16 , 1964			1
but he was snatched off the street by @entity1 – the third of their five known victims			0
for 20 years , mrs @entity23 never knew what happened to her son until @entity26 and @entity27 confessed to murdering him on @entity28 , @entity14			1
he is the only one of their five victims whose body has never been recovered			1
mrs @entity23 , who was 78 , made several thousand trips to the @entity33 in search of her son and has written to every prime minister since he disappeared , begging for help			1
even recently , with her health failing , she refused to give up , employing private firms with sniffer dogs to try to locate @entity16 ’s remains			0
at the time she said : ‘ i ’ll never stop searching until he ’s found			1
i ’ll go on and on until i bring him home			0
when he ’s found , i ’ll know i ’ve done my duty as a mother			1
i ’ll be at ease then			0
but , as had happened countless times before , @entity26 was unmoved by her dying plea and failed to reply			0
‘ he ’s just playing games			0
i ca n’t get over it , ’ she said			0
her death comes just days after revelations that a bombshell letter written by @entity1 supposedly reveals where he and @entity27 buried her 12 - year - old son in 1964			1
mercifully , perhaps , mrs @entity23 was too ill to be told of the latest claims of @entity26 ’s letter			0
hope : @entity1 , lighting a memorial candle at @entity74 during her son 's memorial service in 2010 determined : mrs @entity23 , pictured in 2010 , made several thousand trips to the @entity33 in search of her son her hopes of finally laying @entity16 to rest were stoked in 2003 after detectives from @entity83 launched a special investigation , @entity85 , in a bid to find the remains			1
@entity26 coldly refused to help with this endeavour , dismissing officers with a wave of his hand from his bed when they visited him at @entity93			0
at a memorial service for @entity16 , held at @entity74 in february 2010 , mrs @entity23 finally got the chance to remember her eldest son with a poignant memorial service			1
she wept as she told the congregation at @entity74 how her life 's wish was to find @entity16 and bury his remains before she died			1
@entity1 pictured on @entity28 with her sons @entity103 ( left ) and @entity104 and psychic @entity105 in an attempt to find her son shrine : the wall 's of her home were adorned with photos of her late son who disappeared when he was 12 a woman whose daughter was murdered and her body never found paid tribute to @entity1 's tireless courage today			1
@entity119 's daughter @entity118 was killed in 2004 in @entity120 , @entity121 , and mrs @entity119 - the founder of @entity122 - was left tortured not being able to provide a proper burial			1
murderer @entity124 used a saw to dismember the mother - of - three 's body and her family were only able to bury some bones			1
today she said she believed mrs @entity23 , 78 , always thought she would be given some peace by discovering where her 12 - year - old son @entity7 was buried			2
and she said if there is an afterlife , mrs @entity23 will be reunited with @entity16			0
' it 's terrible news , how awful , ' she said			2
' i had met her through @entity137			0
' being in a similar situation as @entity139 , not to find your child 's body causes a tangible pain			1
' for a child to be murdered is one of the worst things that can happen to a mother and then not to be able to say goodbye , that is all she lived for and she pleaded with @entity26			2
' mrs @entity119 criticised @entity26 for tormenting her by refusing to disclose the schoolboy 's burial spot			2
' killers like these have to have control , ' she said			0
' they get off on knowing because they get self - gratification as @entity26 did			0
' i 'm @entity16 's mother , ' mrs @entity23 , who was helped to the cathedral lectern by a young family friend , sobbed			1
' i 've lived through this life knowing he is on those @entity33			1
i just want him back			0
' i 'll do anything , go anywhere for him			0
as long as i know one day , i 'll be grateful			0
' i hope he 's found before i am dead			2
all i want out of life is to find him and bury him			2
i just wish he is found before i go			0
' during the hour - long service , mrs @entity23 spoke in front of a large painting of her son based on the famous black and white photo of the smiling youngster			2
@entity16 , the congregation heard , was a cheerful child , and , in a time when children 's experiences were confined to the neighbourhood where they were born , he enjoyed street games , marbles and cycling			2
he was a young boy with a ' happy - go - lucky attitude and a cheeky grin ' , who kept leaves in a scrapbook , collected coins and loved football			0
mrs @entity23 then appealed directly to @entity26 to reveal the whereabouts of @entity16 's remains , via a dvd			2
on the dvd , recorded in april 2011 , she said she was receiving treatment for cancer of the womb , adding : ' i 've got cancer and if you 've got any decency or respect for yourself and for me , you would tell me where @entity16 is because that is the last thing i want to happen before i die			2
' ' i 'm doing it in the hope he will respond – that ’s if he watches it , ' mrs @entity23 , from @entity19 , @entity14 , told the people			1
' the most important thing is to find @entity16 before the cancer beats me			1
' he knows where @entity16 is but i think he enjoys having that last bit of power – and if i find @entity16 he ’ll have nothing left			2
her marathon quest for justice has been an emotional roller coaster requiring unprecedented courage and determination			0
demonstration : @entity1 protests outside the the @entity220 s front door a portrait of @entity27 , made of children 's fingerprints was put on display in 1995 @entity225 often revisited the @entity28 , @entity14 , with flowers last year she refused to back the return of the death penalty insisting ' hanging is too quick ' and child murderers must be made to suffer			1
she said : ' hanging is too quick			0
child killers like @entity26 must be made to suffer , in the way he hurt my @entity16 and all the other little ones			2
' the rope is too simple a solution for his sort			0
serial killers like him need to be left to rot , for years , when hopefully they will reflect on their appalling crimes			0
' people could be forgiven for thinking i would be among the first demanding a return to capital punishment , but that is too soft a sentence for @entity26			0
@entity225 reads a letter from @entity27 campaigning : @entity1 ( left ) and @entity248 , mothers of @entity1 victims @entity7 and @entity251 , arrive at @entity252 where they delivered a ' time to fit the crime ' petition ' i really hope that he has suffered over the years and now , maybe in the twilight of his life , he will display a single shred of sympathy by telling me where @entity16 's remains are located			0
' the gesture would mean so much , especially as all police searches for @entity16 's body have officially ended			1
' if @entity26 had swung for his crimes against my son and the others , there would have been no chance - however slim it is - of him relenting and putting me out of my misery by pinpointing @entity16 's grave			1
' in 1995 , mrs @entity225 was outraged when the @entity273 displayed a portrait of @entity27 , made of children 's fingerprints was put on display			1
she put together a protest group for the duration of the show and urged visitors to boycott it			0
when the organisers refused to remove it , protests became even stronger and two visitors managed to throw eggs at @entity288 ’s canvas , forcing it to undergo a quick restoration			0
along with @entity248 , mother of moors murder victim @entity251 , @entity1 went to @entity252 and delivered a ' time to fit the crime ' petition , launched by members of @entity295 , calling for life sentences to mean ' real life ' .			1
