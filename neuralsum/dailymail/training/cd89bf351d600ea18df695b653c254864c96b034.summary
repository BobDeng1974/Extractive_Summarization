by @entity0 a coffee controversy is brewing			2
a new cafe in @entity3 is calling itself dumb @entity4 and using the same logo as the global coffee giant , but staff insist they 're not breaking any laws			1
in fact , it looks almost identical to the real @entity4 apart from one word - ' dumb '			1
the coffee shop which is based in the @entity16 / @entity15 area of the city says that by using the word , it makes it a parody and is therefore permissible under freedom of speech laws			1
' although we are a fully functioning coffee shop , for legal reasons @entity4 needs to be categorize as a work of parody art. so , in the eyes of the law , our ' coffee shop ' is actually an art gallery and the ' coffee ' you ’re buying is considered the art. but that ’s for our lawyers to worry about			1
all you need to do is enjoy our delicious coffee ! ' people have been lining up for @entity60 for up to an hour just to get their hands on a cup — part novelty , part collector ’s item			1
when you reach the front of the line you can order a @entity68 or perhaps take home a cd of @entity71 or perhaps some dumb @entity72			0
faqs : there are plenty of questions			0
is it legal ? probably not ! dumb people : people waited in line for an hour this weekend for coffee that was n't very good either			1
however , it was free dumb @entity4 are justifying their cafe by saying that their store is a ' parody ' and therefore protected by freedom of speech legislation			1
under such law , certain parodies of trademarks may be permissible if they are not too directly tied to commercial use			0
in this case , the cafe is n't charging for the drinks it is providing and can therefore argue that their pop - up shop is not for commercial gain			2
the basic idea here is that the artistic and editorial parodies of trademarks serve a valuable critical function and is entitled to some degree of @entity103 protection			0
of course , @entity4 ' own lawyers will likely argue that this ' store ' is damaging their carefully guarded brand , image and reputation			1
it may very well end up that the people behind dumb @entity4 will be the ones left feeling dumb			1
all of the coffee , brewed by two baristas , is free			0
there 's a dumb @entity4 menu , even @entity4 cups ( in @entity117 , @entity68 and @entity119 sizes )			1
you can also pick up a @entity121 , @entity122 , and @entity123			0
the store , calling itself a legit coffeehouse , features the same logo and look and colors of the famous coffee chain			2
the baristas are no wiser as to who is behind the stunt saying that they simply answered a ' help wanted ' ad on @entity31			0
rumors are circulating that it is really a piece of performance art , perhaps for a tv show			1
despite its popularity with lines out the door , customers seemed confused about what exactly was going on			0
' i saw online that there was a dumb @entity4 sign			2
one of my friends posted about it , and i live across the street , so i just walked over , ' one customer said			0
he described it as ' weirdly off - kilter			0
' the faq sheet explains a little more about the existence of the store			0
' we love @entity4 and look up to them as role models			2
unfortunately , the only way to use their intellectual property under fair use is if we are making fun of them			0
so the word ' dumb ' comes out of necessity , not enmity			0
' strangely familiar : the place looked like a regular @entity4 , only with the word ' dumb ' everywhere collectors piece : part of the attraction was the specially made logo cups dumb @entity4 has a @entity172 account at @ dumbstarbucks , and even local fans like @entity176 ’s @entity175 are posting pictures			1
one person joked that you should get there ' before dumb lawyers get to it			0
' @entity4 is notorious for defending its trademark			2
the real @entity4 has confirmed that the store is n't one of theirs and is looking into the matter			1
you can find the @entity4 at 1802 @entity188 in @entity16 ... for now			2
grab it while you can : the real @entity4 are looking into this store , so it may not last for long !			1

shop opened this weekend and has had lines of up to an hour with people ordering coffee
it 's *unclear* who is behind the store although some are *suggesting* it is part of a reality tv show
@entity4 has said it is aware of the coffee shop and is looking into the matter
