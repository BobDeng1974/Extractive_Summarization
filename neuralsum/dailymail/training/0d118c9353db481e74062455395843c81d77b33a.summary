by @entity0 a sick @entity2 fan has disrupted @entity4 's live coverage of the tragic @entity6 crash with a prank call on live tv claiming that the jetliner had been shot down by the shock jock 's farts			1
the caller tricked his way onto live national tv by saying he was staff sergeant @entity15 from the @entity16 in @entity17 who had witnessed the horrific explosion that left 295 people dead			2
' well i was looking out the window when i saw a projectile flying through the sky and it would appear that the plane was shot down by a blast of wind from @entity2 's a * * , ' the caller deadpanned			0
' so it would appear that the plane was shot down			0
can you tell us anything more from your military training of what sort of missile system that may have been coming from ? ' she inquired			0
the crude caller replied : ' boy , you 're a dumba * * , are n't ya ? ' the cable news network , which lags in third place in ratings , billed the interview as an ' eyewitness exclusive			1
' this is n't the first time this @entity2 fan has managed to get on live tv during a major news event			0
it appears this particular fan has struck before - pranking @entity62 in @entity63 during its 2013 coverage of the manhunt for rouge @entity67 officer @entity66 during the hunt for @entity67 rogue cop @entity66 in february 2013 , a man with the same voice called into @entity62 claiming to be a spokesman for the @entity72			1
he proceeded to tell the anchor that ' @entity74 , ' a regular guest on @entity2 's @entity77 radio show , had been in a shootout with @entity66			1
the @entity80 host continued asking question until he explained : ' you 're a real dumba * *			0
you still do n't know this a prank ... ' the station then hung up on him .			2

@entity4 host @entity31 did n't appear to realize she was being pranked and asked the caller to elaborate
it appears the same man was *responsible* for a prank call during @entity66 manhunt in 2013
