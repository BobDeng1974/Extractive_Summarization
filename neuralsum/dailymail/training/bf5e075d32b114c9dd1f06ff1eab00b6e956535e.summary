by @entity0 it has been imparting words of wisdom and advice to young girls for almost two decades			2
but the editor of @entity8 ’s longest - running pre-teen magazine has now insisted that controversial pop stars including @entity10 will no longer feature in @entity12 magazine , following concerns over their increasingly sexualised behaviour			1
despite being a regular cover star of the publication , which launched in 1995 , the 21 - year - old singer is now considered to be a poor role model for the 7 - 12 age group that the magazine caters for			1
@entity10 first appeared on the cover of @entity12 as 17 - year - old @entity33 starlet @entity32			1
but @entity34 , editor of the magazine , has now revealed that the new campaign , which has been called girls are amazing , will feature more responsible role models such as @entity38 and @entity40 presenter @entity39			1
the move came in response to a readership survey carried out by @entity12 , which revealed that eight of the top ten most - admired celebrities were all singers			1
@entity46 of the list was controversial star @entity48 , followed by @entity38 and @entity49 the study also found that the majority of readers aspired to be a singer , dancer or actor , while a quarter of readers said that the most important way for them to be described was ‘ pretty ’			1
@entity10 first appeared on the cover of @entity12 as 17 - year - old @entity33 starlet @entity32 miss @entity34 told the @entity60 yesterday : ‘ we have always been very careful about having stars in our magazine who are suitable - not too raunchy or controversial			1
‘ we have n’t had @entity10 in the magazine for a long time because she is now too raunchy for us			1
when she was @entity32 we used to have her on the cover all the time			1
she was great for us , but she has changed and she has become much more sexualised			1
‘ it is a bit hard for us to reconcile what her videos are like and that we are dealing with eight year old girls			2
it ’s hard for us to promote her and she is not suitable for this age group			2
‘ it is difficult to find pop stars that are suitable			2
even the most innocent kinds of pop stars are still a bit sexy			2
’ miss @entity34 suggested that @entity79 country singer @entity38 was an example of a pop star who appealed to the pre-teenage readership , but who was not considered overtly sexualised			1
however , she added that the fortnightly magazine , which publishes its 500th issue today , would endeavour to feature a wider range of female celebrities in its pages , including sports stars and successful businesswomen			1
she added : ‘ our readers like pop stars , but we need to make sure that we balance it out and feature people who are n’t dancing around in a sexy way wearing nearly nothing			2
miss @entity34 suggested that @entity79 country singer @entity38 was an example of a pop star who appealed to the pre-teenage readership , but who was not considered overtly sexualised ‘ the ten most admired celebrities were all singers or actors			1
@entity105 , politicians and businesswomen did n’t register on the list			0
‘ we need to show there are lots of other interesting women out there doing interesting things , who are n’t trading on their looks and who are valued for something other than how they look			0
‘ we uphold certain standards where we do n’t talk about anything to do with sex			0
we do n’t talk about boys			0
we are very much about female friendship			0
’ speaking about the magazine , miss @entity34 said delivering content for pre-teenage girls came with a lot of responsibility in preparing them for their teenage years			2
‘ we have always tried to protect the development of young girls , making sure that they do n’t grow up too early , but our survey results have revealed that this is not enough			0
‘ we have a duty to show our readers different ways of being a girl and not just one narrow ideal			0
we want to encourage them to achieve and break away from limiting and old - fashioned beliefs about what girls can do			0
the magazine editor said it will have features on sports stars , and businesswomen , and if it works we will have stars like @entity151 on the cover ‘ within the magazine we will have a much broader range			1
we will have features on sports stars , and businesswomen , and if it works we will have stars like @entity151 on the cover			1
’ ‘ if early on we can give them a sense that there are lots of things that women can do that are worthwhile other than being pretty and attractive , then hopefully that will stick with them as they get older			0
‘ we can give them a foundation so that when they get to their teenage years they have already started thinking about how they can be a chemical engineer			0
‘ i spend a lot of time taking to ten year old girls and they are very switched on			0
they already know about inequality between men and women and understand about the pressures that girls are under			0
they are bombarded constantly with images of airbrushed women			0
it is a very unattainable idea of beauty that we all see			0
they are just the same as women in what they are being fed. ‘ we realised that we really have to do something to help with this			0
we are part of why they think that and we want to break that cycle and show them different people to look up to and show them different careers that they can aspire to			0
