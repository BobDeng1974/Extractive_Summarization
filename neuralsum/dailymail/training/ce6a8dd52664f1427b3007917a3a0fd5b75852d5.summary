by @entity1 reporter published : 07:31 est , 10 november 2012 updated : 11:49 est , 10 november 2012 multiple inquiries : @entity3 , 81 , died 40 hours after being in the care of a doctor who was intoxicated , according to claims three inquiries have been launched into claims that an out - of - hours doctor was too intoxicated to operate the oxygen supply of a frail and elderly woman , who died hours later			1
it is alleged the doctor arrived ' incoherent ' with bloodshot eyes , and phoned a hospital medic for help but appeared not to understand his instructions			2
the following day @entity3 , 81 , was admitted to hospital , and she died 24 hours later on august 17			1
the doctor had been sent by @entity20 , the largest private provider of urgent care services in @entity23			0
following complaints by the hospital medic and @entity3 's daughter @entity26 , @entity20 spent more than two months investigating the doctor			1
he left the company last week although the organisation 's internal inquiry ' found no indication of any alcohol or drug abuse '			0
ms @entity3 , a teacher from @entity34 , said her mother had suffered unnecessary distress and pain in her final hours			1
she told @entity38 : ' my mother suffered because her breathing was becoming more laboured			1
this could have been alleviated			0
any competent doctor would have seen that she was not getting enough oxygen			1
' this doctor was incoherent and his eyes were severely bloodshot			0
it was n't just me , two of my mother 's carers were there at the time			1
' my mother was using quite a noisy oxygen concentrator			1
he said : " is she on oxygen ? " i said : " are you ok doctor ? " , because clearly he was n't			1
' he called the registrar at @entity60 hospital and obviously could n't answer his questions , he was rambling , so i took the phone and spoke to the registrar myself and i said , " look this man is incapable and i 'm frightened "			0
' my mother remained in discomfort			0
i hoped they would send somebody else after i had reported this doctor as being drunk			1
@entity3 meeting @entity70 mp @entity69 in @entity72 two months before her death , having discussed disability transport issues previously			1
ms @entity69 has since offered support to her daughter @entity26 ' i had to call @entity20 the next day as the gp surgery was shut , and i was unable to get a respiratory nurse to attend			0
i said , " can you send another doctor but one who is n't drunk ? " the call handler refused to process that call and passed me to her supervisor who told me she would get a doctor to call me back			2
' this did n't happen			0
later that day - my mother 's breathing deteriorated so i called an ambulance which arrived about 10 minutes after my call			1
' i was told that @entity20 had called an ambulance in response to my telephone call in the morning , however , unless the ambulance they called arrived after the one i called , this is just not true			0
' @entity98 claims her mother @entity3 died after being in the care of a drunk out - of - hours doctor ms @entity3 said she had contacted @entity20 on september 4 , almost a fortnight after her mother 's death to ask if they had an update on their investigation			1
she said : ' i was told , " actually we are just about to send a letter asking for your mother 's authorisation to investigate "			2
i said , " well that 's difficult because my mother is dead "			2
' ms @entity3 added : ' the experience with the doctor was frightening			1
' people think we still have an @entity121 - but we do n't , we have commissioners and providers			0
the providers are increasingly private companies whose primary concern is profit			0
' it seems to be a competition to see who can provide healthcare at the lowest possible cost			0
' this raises huge questions about quality and accountability as illustrated by what happened to my mother			0
' the reality is that we a @entity121 in name only			0
' @entity141 , the primary care trust which contracted @entity20 to provide out - of - hours care , has launched an inquiry			1
the @entity145 , the body which licenses doctors , has also opened an inquiry and the healthcare watchdog the @entity150 is examining the case			1
a spokesperson for @entity141 said : ' we are in the process of fully investigating these serious allegations and now have permission from ms @entity3 to review her mother ’s medical records ; we are doing so as a matter of urgency			1
' the results of this full and thorough investigation and the subsequent action we take as a result , will be shared with ms @entity3 as soon as it is complete			2
' we have spoken to ms @entity3 and reassured her that we are dealing with these very serious issues about the out - of - hours gp service and a healthcare professional at the highest level within our organisation			1
' we would like to express our sincere condolences to ms @entity3 and reassure her that we are doing all we can to get this matter resolved as quickly as possible			2
' a spokesman for @entity20 said : ' as the largest provider of out - of - hours urgent care in the country , we pride ourselves on offering the highest levels of patient care and satisfaction			0
any patient concern with our service is treated very seriously and thoroughly investigated			0
' the gp involved in this particular patient complaint has undergone an extensive performance review as part of a very thorough investigation into ms @entity3 ’s complaint			2
' we have contacted ms @entity3 and did invite her to meet with us so we could share with her the outcome of this review and discuss any further concerns she may have			2
ms @entity3 declined this invitation so we have sent her our findings in writing which include confirmation that the doctor no longer works for @entity20			1
' at a very early stage in our investigation the doctor involved consented to undergo a thorough testing procedure for drug and alcohol misuse			0
all these tests came back negative and there is no evidence at all to support any suggestion or allegation that this doctor was intoxicated whilst on duty			0
' ( @entity209 ) dr @entity210 , whose father @entity211 was killed by out - of - hours @entity213 doctor @entity212 ( right ) when he was administered with 10 times the recommended maximum of diamorphine in one notorious case of an out - of - hours doctor blunder , pensioner @entity211 died after locum dr @entity212 gave him 10 times the recommended maximum amount of diamorphine to treat pain in his kidneys			1
the @entity213 doctor had failed an @entity23 test for one primary care trust , so had simply applied to work at another			0
following his father 's tragic death , dr @entity210 , had called for all doctors to undergo checks on their clinical competence			0
after dr @entity212 was struck off in 2010 , the @entity231 , the @entity145 ( @entity145 ) and former health secretary @entity232 all rushed to condemn the loophole in @entity236 law that meant the language skills of doctors trained in @entity239 could not be tested before they practised in the @entity240			2
records show that coroners ' courts and the @entity145 have since dealt with dozens of cases around the country in which the services have been involved in the deaths of patients , including at least eight in one year .			2

@entity98 claims her mother @entity3 , 81 , struggled to breathe because the doctor was drunk and unable to control her oxygen supply
@entity3 's breathing continued to deteriorate and she died 40 hours later
inquiries have been launched by the @entity141 , the @entity145 and the @entity150
