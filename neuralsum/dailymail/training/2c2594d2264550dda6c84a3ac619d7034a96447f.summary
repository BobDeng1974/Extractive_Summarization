the word ' jolly ' has long been a byword word for ' plump ' - hijacked by experts in the back handed compliment			0
but scientists believe there could be genetic evidence which explains why fat people are often happier than their skinny friends			1
it comes after @entity12 favourite @entity11 has been flying the flag for larger women insisting she is a ' big , happy girl ' , more than comfortable with her size			2
scientists have linked the ' fat gene ' with the ' happy gene '			1
@entity12 star @entity11 has recently said she is a ' big , really happy girl who is lucky enough to be confident in her own skin ' the breakthrough could be an explanation for why obese characters , such as @entity22 and @entity23 , are often portrayed as jovial and kindly scientists from @entity25 in @entity26 found the so called ' fat gene ' @entity28 is also a ' happy gene ' too			1
@entity28 is the major genetic contributor to obesity			2
but it is also associated with an eight per cent reduction in the risk of depression			1
the gene in question is @entity28 , which may also lower the risk of depression by eight per cent researchers at @entity25 in @entity26 had been investigating whether there was a link between obesity and depression			1
but when they investigated the genetic and psychiatric status of patients enrolled in the @entity47 study , led by the @entity48 , they found the opposite was true			2
the study analysed 17,200 dna samples from participants in 21 countries			0
results showed those with the the previously identified @entity28 gene - the fat gene - showed significantly less signs of depression			1
the study finding was confirmed by analysing the genetic status of patients in three additional international studies			0
professor @entity63 , of @entity25 in @entity26 , said : ' we set out to follow a different path , starting from the hypothesis that both depression and obesity deal with brain activity			1
' we hypothesised that obesity genes may be linked to depression			2
' the difference of eight per cent is modest and it wo n't make a big difference in the day - to - day care of patients			0
' but , we have discovered a novel molecular basis for depression			0
' it is the first evidence that an @entity28 obesity gene is associated with protection against major depression , independent of its effect on body mass index			1
' in a recent interview @entity12 favourite @entity11 said she was more than comfortable with her size			0
she said she is ‘ a big , really happy girl who is lucky enough to be confident in her own skin ’ , and added : ' many would give their left arm to be thinner			0
not me ' she added : ' i genuinely love being different and it drives me mad that people do n’t believe i ’m happy as i am			0
' why do i want to look like everyone else ? but i know people think : “ she says that , but she does n’t mean it , she ’s very sad really "			0

scientists from @entity25 in @entity26 found the so called ' fat gene ' @entity28 is also a ' happy gene ' , too
@entity103 with an eight per cent reduction in the risk of depression
