published : 17:45 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 18:01 est , 3 january 2014 third - round weekend			2
just saying those words takes me back to childhood and triggers the excitement i had for the @entity6			1
what a competition it used to be			0
from the start of the season to the beginning of december , i would regularly think about which team @entity12 would get drawn against on the first saturday in january			0
the excitement and anticipation was massive because everyone was dreaming about @entity16			1
i still remember the buzz of the build - up to the third round , taking in all the unusual stories in the papers , on the radio and tv about little - known players who had dreams of becoming household names			1
third - round day itself was mixed with nerves and excitement			0
if i was n't at the game , i 'd be sat in front of the tv , glued to @entity32			0
party time : @entity34 with @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 after winning the @entity6 in 2006 reflective : @entity34 , pictured with the @entity6 in 2001 ( right ) and 2006 reckons replays should be abolished we take it for granted now that goal updates come through immediately on websites , @entity43 or to your phone but 25 years ago , you would pray for good news to flash up on the vidiprinter at the bottom of the screen			1
back in the 1980s , if you asked fans in august which trophy they would prefer to win , either the @entity55 or the @entity6 , it would come down to the toss of a coin			2
that 's how big it was : if a side 's form in the league had tailed off by @entity63 , the crowds would flock back for the third round			0
i loved it when i was a kid and i loved it when i was a player , too			0
i cherish the two medals i won in 2001 and 2006 , after @entity71 's victories against @entity72 and @entity73 at the @entity74			0
in 2001 , as we chased an unprecedented cup treble , @entity75 would regularly tell us the @entity78 would be the pinnacle of that campaign			0
in many respects he was right : you do n't get the chance to win a @entity85 trophy every season			0
but for the @entity88 players in the dressing room , we were desperate to get our hands on the @entity6			1
now , though , its appeal is on the wane and @entity95 's alarming comments about it being a commitment that @entity97 could do without have illustrated where clubs see their priorities			0
the @entity101 has become the be-all and end - all ; such is the intensity of the competition and the excitement generated , every saturday feels like third - round weekend once did			1
that competition dominates to such an extent that if you ask fans now which they would prefer - to win the @entity6 or finish in the top four - the vast majority would pick the latter			1
in the spotlight : @entity97 boss @entity95 sparked controversy when he questioned the importance of the @entity6 i understand the finances involved , but is n't football all about savouring the magical days when you get to celebrate a piece of silverware ? as a fan , i 'd rather be in @entity126 's situation of last season			1
those supporters will have memories to take to the grave			0
the major thing i would do to revive it would be to abolish replays - all ties would have to reach a conclusion on the same day			2
i 'd even be tempted to do away with extra-time and go straight to a penalty shootout if it was a draw at 90 minutes			0
replays are a waste of time			1
you rarely , if ever , see capacity crowds for replays now and it is embarrassing when games are staged with rows of empty seats in the background			0
that shows what fans think of them			0
they also put an unnecessary strain on players in terms of fitness and create fixture congestion			1
sight for sore eyes : there were plenty of empty seats at last season 's replay between @entity163 and @entity164 few and far between : fans did n't turn out in force for @entity126 's @entity6 visit to the @entity168 in 2008 if you scrapped replays , you could move a round of league fixtures from the festive period , when players are vulnerable to muscle problems , back to a later date			1
playing twice in three days at @entity63 is ridiculous			0
a win - or - bust situation would also leave managers thinking twice about making significant changes ; plus , with rounds three , four and five being on weekends when no league games are scheduled , there would be no need to rest players if you knew there would be no replay looming			2
some will say that axeing replays would deprive lower division clubs of the chance to get a payday but what would be more special for them - the chance to dramatically claim a huge scalp or just going somewhere for a day out with no realistic chance of winning ? another thing i would do is stage semi-finals at neutral venues			1
i played in semi-finals at @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity16			1
while the one at @entity16 was one of the best days of my career - we came from behind to beat @entity12 - the national stadium should be for one - off matches			1
@entity16 should always feel special			2
day to remember : @entity126 sprung a huge surprise when they beat @entity209 in last season 's final time to celebrate : @entity34 with team - mate @entity212 in 2006 you would rather win the @entity6 than the @entity214 , but it feels as if the @entity6 is playing second fiddle at the minute			1
the @entity214 has all the drama , the games are staged under lights , while the final itself stands alone in february , unlike the @entity6 , which competes with the climax of the @entity101 and @entity222			1
in 2011 , remember , there was the ludicrous situation where @entity209 won the @entity6 on the same day @entity225 won the title			1
what the @entity214 has done is move with the times , as have the @entity101 and the @entity222			1
they have evolved and are miles better than they were 20 years ago but , sadly , you ca n't say that about the @entity6			1
people like its tradition but life moves at a different pace now and there is no place for watching the cup final on tv from 9am , as we used to			0
some broadcasters tried that recently and it does n't work			0
so while the @entity6 is not on its last legs , i believe these small changes would make a difference			2
for a tournament that has given such joy to so many , it deserves to be helped			0
it has been good to see @entity248 remind people over @entity63 what a top goalkeeper he is			2
he was man of the match when @entity209 beat @entity71 , got a black eye for his efforts against @entity254 and showed he has benefited from being taken out of the firing line by @entity256			2
it is often said quality keepers are worth 10 - 12 points during a season and @entity248 has made a difference to @entity209 over the festive period			1
his saves against @entity71 and @entity254 turned two draws into wins			0
back in action : @entity248 has been restored to the @entity209 first team after his spell on the bench i admire @entity256 for being so bold			1
@entity248 is a far better keeper than @entity269 and was always going to get his place back but many other managers might have ducked the issue			2
the most impressive thing , however , was @entity248 's reaction			2
he could not have dealt with it any better ; he kept his thoughts to himself , he never went running to the press or created any tension			0
i know how it feels to be out of the team when you think you should be playing			0
the only thing you can do , though , is take your medicine , keep your dignity and grab your chance when it comes along			0
@entity248 's done all those things and is getting his just rewards			2
i outlined my hopes for the coming 12 months in last week 's column , but now is the time to make a few predictions			0
there are five major trophies up for grabs between now and the end of the season and here 's who i think will lift them			0
1 @entity101 : @entity300 - they were my tip at the start of the season and i 'm not deserting them			1
@entity209 have been the most impressive team so far but @entity304 is the best manager in the league and could prove decisive			2
2 @entity222 : @entity307 - it is about time they won it again			1
@entity309 deserves it for the way he has performed but the big thing in @entity307 's favour is they have a kind draw			0
they can come out on top in the @entity319 final			0
blue moon : @entity300 and @entity307 are @entity34 's favourites to win the @entity101 and @entity222 3 @entity6 : @entity321 who do not have @entity85 on their schedule , such as @entity12 and @entity324 , will be looking to target this trophy but @entity71 are enjoying a great season and have the weapons to beat anyone on their day			1
4 @entity214 : @entity209 - it looks like it will be an all - @entity331 affair at @entity16 on march 2 and after their game at the @entity336 this season , a 4 - 1 @entity209 win , you would have to favour @entity256 's men to come out on top			1
5 @entity78 : @entity340 - they were unlucky not to make the @entity222 knockout stages			1
but , having spent heavily last summer , they are one of the best teams in the @entity78 and , in @entity345 , they have the manager who won it last season			0
@entity350 idol : could @entity351 inspire @entity71 to @entity6 glory this term ?			2

replays are a waste of time and put an unnecessary strain on the players
semi-final *clashes* must be played at a neutral venue with @entity16 saved for the *showpiece*
the @entity222 , @entity101 and @entity214 have evolved over the last 20 years - the @entity6 has n't
@entity248 has proved he is a class act for @entity209 and @entity88
