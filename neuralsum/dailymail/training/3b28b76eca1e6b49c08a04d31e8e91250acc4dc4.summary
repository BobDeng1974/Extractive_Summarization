by @entity0 a mineral discovered on @entity2 could suggest there may have been past life on the red planet			2
scientists have discovered that the earliest living organisms on @entity8 were capable of creating this mineral , which may hint that similar microbes were able to do the same on @entity2			1
named stevensite , the clay mineral has been used since ancient times by @entity13 women in @entity14 as a beauty treatment			2
a mineral discovered on @entity2 could suggest there may have been past life on the red planet			2
scientists have found that the earliest living organisms on @entity8 were capable of creating this mineral , named @entity20			1
pictured is the late dr @entity22 from the @entity23 sampling microbes but up until now , scientists had believed deposits of the mineral could only be formed in harsh conditions like volcanic lava and hot alkali lakes			1
researchers led by dr @entity31 from the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) in @entity32 have now found living microbes create an environment that allows stevensite to form , raising new questions about the stevensite found on @entity2			2
@entity20 can be found on @entity2 , and in some places on @entity8			2
the clay mineral has been used since ancient times by @entity13 women as a beauty treatment			0
but up until now , scientists had believed deposits could only be formed in harsh conditions like volcanic lava and hot alkali lakes ‘ it 's much more likely that the stevensite on @entity2 is made geologically , from volcanic activity , ’ dr @entity31 said			1

the latest study found that microbes can become encrusted by stevensite to create ‘ microbialites ’			1
microbialites are the earliest large - scale evidence of life on @entity8 ‘ but our finding – that stevensite can form around biological organisms – will encourage re-interpretation of these @entity2 deposits and their possible links to life on that planet			1
’ dr @entity31 and his colleagues found microbes can become encrusted by @entity55 , which protects their delicate insides and provides the rigidity to allow them to build reef - like structures called ‘ microbialites ’			1
‘ @entity57 are the earliest large - scale evidence of life on @entity8 , ’ dr @entity31 said			1
‘ they demonstrate how microscopic organisms are able to join together to build enormous structures that sometimes rivalled the size of today 's coral reefs			2
’ he said the process still happens today in some isolated places like @entity82 and @entity83 in @entity84			0
‘ @entity20 is usually assumed to require highly alkaline conditions to form , such as volcanic soda lakes			1
but our stevensite microbialites grow in a lake less salty than seawater and with near - neutral ph , ’ he added			1
‘ it 's much more likely that the stevensite on @entity2 is made geologically , from volcanic activity , ’ said @entity31 from the @entity23			1
‘ but our finding – that stevensite can form around biological organisms – will encourage re-interpretation of these @entity2 deposits and their possible links to life on that planet ’ the discovery of microbes once living on @entity2 is key to understanding whether life once flourished on the red planet			1
in a separate study , researchers have shown that some of the simplest and oldest organisms on our planet could also survive on the @entity2 surface			0
named methanogens , these organisms use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to metabolise and produce methane			0
methanogens live in swamps and marshes , but can also be found in the gut of cattle and termites , as well as in dead and decaying animals			0
these ancient and highly - specialised ‘ extremophiles ’ are thought to be able to grow quickly in harsh conditions			1
they are anaerobic , so they do n't require oxygen			0
they also do n't require organic which suggests they could exist in sub-surface environments			0
in a separate study , researchers have shown that some of the simplest and oldest organisms on our planet could also survive on the @entity2 surface			0
amed methanogens , these organisms use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to metabolise and produce methane researchers from the @entity141 wanted to see if two species of methanogens could withstand @entity2 freeze - thaw cycles below the organisms ’ ideal growth temperatures			0
@entity147 was placed in a chamber 55 ° @entity150 ) and @entity149 in one at 37 ° @entity151 )			0
the two species were selected because one is a hyperthermophile , meaning it thrives under extremely hot temperatures , and the other is a thermophile , which thrives under warm temperatures			0
‘ the surface temperature on @entity2 varies widely , often ranging between -90 ° c and 27 ° c over one martian day , ’ said @entity161 , a doctoral student at the @entity141			0
‘ if any life were to exist on @entity2 right now , it would at least have to survive that temperature range			0
‘ the survival of these two methanogen species exposed to long - term freeze / thaw cycles suggests methanogens could potentially inhabit the subsurface of @entity2			0

study found microbes can become encrusted by the mineral stevensite
this protects their insides and gives them the rigidity to build structures called ‘ microbialites ’ - the earliest large - scale evidence of life on @entity8
up until now , scientists had believed stevensite deposits could only be formed in harsh conditions like volcanic lava and hot alkali lakes
