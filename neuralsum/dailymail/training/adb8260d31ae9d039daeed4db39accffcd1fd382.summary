by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 will join forces this week to promise @entity6 more powers from @entity8 if voters choose to stay in the @entity10			1
a cross-party plan for increased control over tax , welfare and job creation in @entity16 would be announced ‘ within days ’ , said chancellor @entity17			1
as polls point to a surge in support for independence , it was seen as a last throw of the dice for the no campaign – and immediately dismissed as a ‘ panicky ’ ploy by @entity27			1
however , there was scant detail – and it later emerged that plans will consist of a cross-party convention to hammer out agreement based on devolution proposals already unveiled by the @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			0
‘ you will see in the next few days a plan of action to give more powers to @entity6 : more tax powers , more spending powers , more plans for powers over the welfare state , ’ the chancellor told @entity57 ’s @entity56 show			1
‘ that will be put into effect – the timetable for delivering that will be put into effect the moment there is a no vote in the referendum			0
the clock will be ticking for delivering those powers , and then @entity6 will have the best of both worlds			1
‘ they will both avoid the risks of separation but have more control over their own destiny , which is where i think many @entity6 want to be			1
’ the move appeared to be an attempt to mirror the independence referendum in the @entity88 province of @entity89 in 1995 – when a shock lead by the @entity92 camp was overturned on polling day after a last - ditch promise of new powers			2
chancellor @entity17 said the final touches were being put to proposals for ‘ much greater ’ fiscal autonomy and tax - raising powers for @entity40 both @entity3 , left , and @entity2 , right , will join forces this week to promise @entity6 more powers from @entity8 if voters choose to stay in the @entity10 a new wave of devolution to @entity6 will trigger fierce debate about whether @entity104 needs a mechanism to exclude @entity6 mps from voting on matters that no longer affect their constituencies – or even its own parliament			1
welsh first minister @entity111 insisted that further devolution offered to @entity6 should also be offered to @entity113			1
however , mr @entity27 said the offer lacked any credibility , particularly as it came after postal voters in @entity6 have already returned their ballot papers			1
‘ it shows the chaos , confusion and total disintegration of the no campaign , because quite clearly if you were serious			0
you would tend to announce it before people voted rather than after many people have voted , ’ the first minister said			0
‘ this is a panicky , last - minute measure because the @entity92 campaign is winning on the ground			0
’ @entity6 ’s deputy first minister @entity131 claimed that it ‘ increasingly looks as if the no campaign think people in @entity6 are daft ’			1
she said : ‘ if the no campaign parties had any serious intention of delivering substantial new powers for @entity6 , then why has it taken until ten days before polling day , with a poll showing @entity92 in the lead , for them to come up with this ? ’ a graph showing how the yes campaign has overtook the no campaign for the first time stockmarkers were braced for a nervous opening today as investors react to the surprise reversal of fortunes for @entity6 nationalists			1
the pound could be under pressure after the @entity92 campaign took the lead in polls			0
last tuesday , the uncertainty pushed sterling 0.5 per cent lower against the dollar , hitting a five - month low			0
firms with a large presence in @entity6 could also suffer today over heightened fears that separation will disrupt businesses and cause costs to spiral			2
drinks firm @entity162 , which earns about a quarter of its £ 11.3billion annual sales from @entity164 , is concerned a @entity92 vote could jeopardise @entity167 membership and international agreements on trade			0
@entity170 has also warned over the lack of clarity over what currency an independent @entity6 would use , @entity167 membership , and plans for financial regulation and taxation			2
other big firms with a significant @entity6 presence include drugs giant @entity180 and @entity181 which has warned that it might be forced to rethink investment in the @entity183			2
@entity184 , a chief economist at research firm @entity185 , said : ‘ how much further the pressure on sterling ramps up will likely depend on whether polls continue to show the @entity92 vote improving			0
‘ the markets hate uncertainty , and it is now not only highly uncertain whether there will be a yes or no vote in the @entity6 referendum , but there is also massive uncertainty over as to whether or not the @entity6 will be able to keep sterling			0
’ claiming there is ‘ no guarantee whatsoever ’ that @entity6 would get a single additional power for its @entity203 , she added : ‘ i think the debate in @entity6 has gone beyond the point where people can be fooled and taken in by empty promises from @entity209 parties			2
’ but former @entity48 prime minister @entity4 hailed the prospect of more powers for @entity6 , and derided the focus on personalities and tv debates			1
‘ this in the end is too important to be about the jokes that someone makes or the way that they make their argument or how they dress or what sort of presentational issues , ’ he told @entity224 ’s @entity223 programme			0
mr @entity4 said he understood the ‘ desire for change ’ but urged @entity6 not to take the ‘ easy shortcut ’ of independence			2
‘ the way to do it over these next few months is to elect a @entity48 government , to strengthen the @entity6 parliament and make it more capable of doing the things we want to do , ’ he added			0
@entity27 said the offer lacked any credibility , particularly as it came after postal voters in @entity6 have already returned their ballot papers with control over council tax and business rates , the @entity241 currently raises about 15 per cent of its £ 30billion budget , with the majority of public spending funded by the @entity248			1
a radical plan by the @entity49 would allow @entity40 to control 60 per cent of its revenue – with full control over inheritance tax , capital gains tax , income tax and a good share of corporation tax			2
@entity48 proposed increasing the figure to 40 per cent by allowing @entity6 to control a 15p share of the basic 20p rate of income tax			1
the @entity47 would allow full control over all rates of income tax , with a reduced @entity248 grant			0
vat levels must remain the same under @entity167 rules , but a share of the revenue from @entity6 would be controlled by @entity40			0
@entity269 would also be allowed to ‘ supplement ’ welfare benefits			0
mr @entity17 also accused mr @entity27 of not ‘ telling the straight truth ’ about what currency an independent @entity6 would use			1
he argued that a proposal to keep the pound would not be accepted by @entity209 – likening it to a divorced couple continuing to share a bank account .			0

cross-party plan for more control over tax , welfare and jobs to be announced
more powers for @entity6 from @entity8 will only be given if voters chose to stay in the @entity10
comes as polls point to a surge in independence and is seen as a ' last throw of the dice '
but @entity6 first minister @entity27 has said the offer lacked any credibility
