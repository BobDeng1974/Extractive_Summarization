@entity1 went on to introduce a story about new @entity33 stamps to celebrate his @entity35 victory			1
however the screen then flashed to stills of @entity30 and his new exhibition			0
@entity1 , 57 , struggled to contain her composure and burst into laughter as production workers scrambled to fix the blunders			2
pressure : the experienced newsreader shakes her fists at the frustrating delays blowing her top : @entity1 shouts at the end of the broadcast as it all gets too much			1
but viewers felt she handled the situation with good humour she told viewers : ' oh , it ’s a wee bit of a dog ’s breakfast			1
let me wait for instructions			0
i think we are going to go ...			0
' they ’re having a little argument behind me			0
