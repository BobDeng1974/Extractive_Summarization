by @entity0 published : 04:14 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 04:14 est , 11 april 2013 an ' incredibly unusual ' fossil fish with fins behind its anus could have implications for human evolution , researchers say			1
dr @entity7 at the @entity8 identified the paired fins of @entity10 , a fossil jawless fish that swam in the seas around 370 million years ago			1
they say the unusual positioning of the fins show an important evolutionary shift			0
@entity10 with the anal fins visible near the tail			1
researchers say the dual fin development is unique , and could give clues to how legs and arms developed in humans @entity10 , a fossil jawless fish that swam in the seas around 370 million years ago			1
the @entity28 fish were 3.9 inches ( 10 centimeters ) long and looked somewhat like modern - day eels			0
the specimens in the latest study were unearthed in a fossil bed in @entity33 , @entity34 , decades ago , and were stored in collections in the @entity36 in @entity37 and the @entity38 , @entity39 , in @entity34			2
' @entity40 is unique because its anal fin is paired meaning there is one fin on each side of the fish , ' said dr @entity7			2
' up until now anal fins have only been seen on jawed fish where they are unpaired and this is true of both extinct and modern fish			0
' the age of @entity10 is important as it dates from the time of a deep evolutionary split between jawed and jawless fish , the two main divisions of vertebrates alive today			1
' as such , it represents an important stage in the evolution of paired appendages			1
' dr @entity7 came across the paired fins as part of a study of @entity28 fossils in @entity34 , @entity66			0
@entity68 surface scans of fossils and comparison of specimens preserved in different conditions revealed that there were two fan - shaped fins , a left and a right			0
' it ’s not clear why the fins are positioned so far back on the fish , or what advantage they might have provided			0
' however , they do show that our early vertebrate ancestors tried out lots of different body plans before settling on two arms and two legs			1
@entity10 , a fossil jawless fish that swam in the seas around 370 million years ago , is related to the eel ' if they had n’t then our bodies would have looked very different ! ' dr @entity7 ’s research on the paired fins followed on from a 2009 study of early vertebrate evolution and fossil preservation with colleagues from the @entity97			1
their findings have been published in the @entity101 ’s journal @entity102			0
dr @entity7 says it was an exciting find : ' the unusual paired anal fin of @entity40 lends support to the idea that there was some degree of developmental and evolutionary experimentation in some fish			2
' after the @entity113 period and the extinction of a lot of species , the jawed vertebrate body exhibits fewer deviations from the formula of paired pectoral , paired pelvic , unpaired dorsal and unpaired anal appendages			2
' the discovery of new anatomical conditions will hopefully shed more light on the timing and sequence of the events underlying the origin and diversification of vertebrate appendages			0

fins found on @entity10 , a fossil jawless fish that swam in the seas around 370 million years ago
find makes the fish one of the first vertebrate to develop paired appendages such as fins , legs or arms
