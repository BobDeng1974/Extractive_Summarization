@entity0 is dreaming of @entity1 and that is not entirely down to the romantic notion that he has yet to return in competition to the principality since leaving the club 20 years ago			1
@entity1 , one of six teams @entity7 can be paired with in monday ’s draw for the @entity9 last 16 , are struggling in the @entity11 league after selling @entity12 and loaning out @entity13			1
@entity14 is another option he would take ahead of the other four : @entity17 champions @entity18 , @entity20 champions @entity19 , @entity23 champions @entity21 or @entity24			2
@entity7 boss @entity0 , pictured with @entity25 at @entity1 in 1987 , is keen to play the @entity11 side ‘ we ’ve never had an easy ride , ’ said @entity0 , who has been drawn against @entity19 at this stage in the last two seasons and , in the two years before that , @entity30 and @entity24			1
@entity7 have not been past the last 16 since 2009 - 10 when they beat @entity14 before losing in the quarter - finals to @entity24			1
‘ i do n’t think many teams want @entity21 , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we do n’t want @entity19 and i ’m sure they do n’t want us			0
i ’m not against @entity1 because it would be a visit to my first home			0
i would love to go there			0
@entity38 ( right ) and @entity39 celebrate during @entity7 's 2010 victory over @entity14 - the last time the @entity41 advanced from the last 16 stage of the @entity9 ‘ i ’ve got great memories of @entity1 because they gave me a chance when i was a very young manager			1
‘ when i arrived they had never been past the first round in the @entity9 so we have good memories			2
it is a fantastic place			0
’ @entity0 was in charge of @entity1 for seven years from 1987 , during which time he won the league title and the @entity52			1
@entity0 spent seven years with @entity1 and won the league and @entity52 during his time in charge @entity7 defender @entity56 said : ‘ it would be great if we could wait a bit for @entity18 or @entity24			1
it would mean the boss goes back there and for us , the @entity11 players of the squad , it would be good to go home			0
‘ we need to have ambitions			0
it is great to have qualified for the last 16 , yet again , but we need to look for more			0
a club like @entity7 has to go further			2
‘ we did the job by getting through to the knockout stages but it ’s not finished			0
we want more but we know the games will be really tough now			0
’ @entity41 defender @entity56 ( left ) is adamant a club like @entity7 must go further than the last 16			1

@entity0 keen to face former club in @entity1 in @entity9
@entity7 could draw the @entity11 @entity79 strugglers in last 16
