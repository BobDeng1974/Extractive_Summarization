this could have been avoided			0
if @entity2 had said he wanted to give @entity3 the chance to build on his eye - catching efforts against @entity6 , we would have been none the wiser about @entity9 ’s fatigue			1
every word the @entity12 manager says is scrutinised			2
i can see where @entity2 was coming from but an issue has been created that both men could have done without			2
had @entity2 explained he wanted to use @entity9 for an impact – which he had , by winning the decisive free - kick against @entity18 – there would be no quarrel			1
now , though , @entity9 is in the spotlight and contending with questions such as ‘ how can a 19 - year - old be tired ? ’ but those who believe he has made a mistake saying he was n’t in the right condition to play for @entity12 are not looking at the full picture			1
so , in some respects , he has been brave to confront the issue and explain his concerns to @entity2			2
would i have ever done it ? no. i feared if i missed a game , someone would come in and take my place			0
i also never wanted to give managers an excuse to leave me out , so there were times when i played in games i should n’t have done			0
was it the right thing to do ? no. injuries are what i would mask but i remember a game at @entity69 in september 2006 when i was shattered , having been to the @entity70 in @entity71			0
we lost 2 - 0 , one of the goals came from a cross into the box			1
i tried to jump for a header but had nothing in my legs			0
had i been right , i know i would have got my head to the ball first			0
as a central defender , you can find a way of getting through a game , you do n’t have to operate at the rapier pace that @entity9 moves with			1
his game is based around high intensity sprinting and he needs sharpness to go past opponents , with or without the ball			0
the @entity12 substitutes watch on as 19 - year - old @entity9 ( second right ) was rested from the starting line - up 32 - @entity42 , @entity94 29 - @entity95 28 - @entity44 , @entity35 27 - @entity40 26 - @entity3 24 - @entity31 , @entity45 23 - @entity43 22 - @entity38 21 - @entity97 - @entity96 19 - @entity98 , @entity9 we want @entity9 to thrill us , to be an exciting figure for many years to come			1
we do n’t want him to get to 25 and his best form be a thing of the past			0
if he is managed properly now and looks after himself , he wo n’t suffer burn out like another former @entity105 and @entity12 teenage prodigy			1
a few weeks ago , i spent some time with sir @entity107			0
during our conversation , he remembered how , in 1997 , @entity108 and i had played at the @entity111 - 20 @entity70 in @entity112			2
@entity108 came back and went straight into @entity105 ’s first team at the start of the season			1
by contrast , the @entity117 players in that @entity12 squad – @entity121 and @entity122 – were both given a month off to recover but @entity108 was on a rapid upward curve and at the end of that campaign , he set the @entity70 finals in @entity127 alight			1
@entity108 wanted to play in every game for club and country but , in october 1998 , @entity131 and @entity132 – in their brief reign as @entity105 ’s joint managers – decided to rest him for a @entity137 game against @entity138			1
@entity108 was n’t happy and said in an interview “ i ’ll rest when i ’m 40 ”			1
former @entity105 and @entity140 striker @entity108 wanted to play every game for club and country @entity9 told @entity2 he was feeling tired and not in the right mental state during training on saturday evening @entity33 defends @entity12 tiredness that comment went down well with supporters and ex-players but was he right ? no. @entity108 played far too much for @entity105 and @entity12 too early , never getting a summer off to recharge physically or mentally			1
was it a coincidence that he suffered a serious hamstring injury in april 1999 ? @entity9 is becoming like @entity108 , with stature and his pace and his importance to club and country at such an early stage of his career but there have been signs over the last few weeks that such a punishing spell is beginning to catch up with him			1
he may have only played two games at the @entity70 but @entity9 was training every day in stifling conditions , having just come off a season in which he had been a key figure in @entity105 ’s title charge			1
after three weeks off , he then went to the @entity166 for @entity105 ’s pre-season tour			2
do n’t underestimate what an impact that schedule will have had on him , physically and mentally			0
between may 30 , 2013 and october 13 , 2013 , @entity9 had played 615 minutes of football			2
in the same period this year , that figure had shot up to 1682 minutes			0
@entity9 may have only started two games at the @entity174 but the @entity12 winger was in training daily @entity9 came on in the 64th minute but still received criticism from those on @entity179 for his decision @entity9 , warming up during the first half , complained of feeling tired in training ahead of the @entity183 qualifier @entity2 and @entity184 will talk about how to handle him going forward but , naturally , they are going to want to use him when they can as he is a match - winner			1
that ’s why he played against @entity189 in the @entity190			0
@entity105 ’s poor start in the league meant @entity184 needed his quality			2
@entity105 could not have afforded to be on the end of a giant - killing that night , so the plan would have been to get the game won and get @entity9 off early			1
as it was , things never went to plan and he subjected to 120 minutes			0
since then , his performances have been notably lacking sparkle			0
@entity9 retweeted those criticising him online before writing : ' now listening to ... excuse me for being human ' his importance at @entity204 is vital and that is why , at the end of last season , @entity184 called him “ the best young player in @entity209 ”			0
he was dazzling in that spell but that was a spell when @entity105 were only playing one game a week			2
this is the first time he has played consistently in games of this pressure and will take some adjustment			0
but if he is become one of the top players in the world , he will ultimately have to get used to an unrelenting schedule .			0

@entity9 told @entity2 he was too tired to start for @entity12 against @entity18 on *sunday*
the @entity105 winger came on as a 64th - minute substitute in the 1 - 0 win
those saying he was wrong to pull himself out of the starting line - up are not thinking of the consequences
former @entity105 and @entity12 star @entity108 wanted to play in every game for club and country , and he once said : ' i *'ll* rest when i *'m* 40 '
