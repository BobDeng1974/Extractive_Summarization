by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 delivered what was branded an ‘ electoral suicide note ’ last night as he boasted of blocking a string of 16 @entity6 policies			1
the deputy prime minister pointed out how he had prevented the government from cutting inheritance tax , scrapping the @entity11 and reining in green energy			1
in an attempt to echo @entity15 ’s famous declaration , mr @entity2 cried ‘ no , no , no ’ as he cast the @entity16 as a perpetual brake on @entity19 excess			2
@entity2 was accused of delivering an ' electoral suicide note ' by boasting of blocking 16 @entity6 policies the deputy prime minister ( pictured embracing wife @entity22 ) said he had prevented the government from cutting inheritance tax , scrapping the @entity11 and reining in green energy he used his conference speech to revel in having frustrated his coalition partners ’ attempts to : cut inheritance tax bring back o - levels encourage more providers to run free schools by allowing them to make profits relax childcare ratios to reduce costs for parents cut employment red tape by allowing no - fault dismissal implement regional pay in the public sector remove housing benefit from the under - 25s ditch the @entity11 relax the @entity43 automatically renew the @entity45 nuclear deterrent carry on with ‘ go home ’ poster vans aimed at illegal immigrants change constituency boundaries @entity50 limit green energy stop geography teachers teaching about climate change foil the ‘ snoopers ’ charter ’ @entity2 's claims have been ridiculed including his suggestion that there would not have been economic growth without the @entity16 a senior @entity6 backbencher quickly labelled mr @entity2 ’s list of blocked policies an ‘ electoral suicide note ’			1
addressing activists , mr @entity2 said that in the past , he had ‘ always thought it was better to tell people about the things you ’ve achieved , not just the things you ’ve stopped ’			2
but he said : ‘ people do need to know how coalition operates and what we do day in , day out			0
’ his decision to then reel off 16 policies his party has stymied will be seen as the start of the two @entity79 parties distancing themselves from each other ahead of the 2015 general election			1
but it delighted conservative mps , who said he had helped to illustrate what a majority @entity6 government could achieve after 2015			2
mr @entity2 rewrote history yesterday , telling his party how he vetoed changes to constituency boundaries after his @entity6 partners broke a political deal			1
in august last year he declared the @entity16 would vote against the changes recommended by an independent commission			0
the changes would have allowed the @entity19 to gain around another 20 seats at the next election			0
mr @entity2 said he had acted in retaliation for the @entity6 ’ opposition to his pet project for reform of the @entity101 and said they had broken the @entity79 ‘ contract ’ they had made			1
in fact the 2010 @entity79 deal links boundary changes to the referendum on the alternative vote system , not @entity100			0
the @entity79 agreement bound the @entity19 simply to set up a committee to suggest changes , which they did			0
but when the plans came to @entity114 , @entity112 voted against them and the prime minister told mr @entity2 he was unable to stop a revolt by 91 of his backbenchers			1
they also ridiculed his claim that if he had not been in power with the @entity6 , there would have been no economic growth			1
often in coalition , mr @entity2 said , compromise ‘ just is n’t possible and you just have to say “ no ” ’			2
‘ inheritance tax cuts for millionaires – no. bringing back o - levels and a two - tier education system – no. profit - making in schools – no. new childcare ratios – no. firing workers at will , without any reasons given – no , absolutely no. @entity136 pay penalising public - sector workers in the @entity138 – no , ’ he said			1
‘ scrapping housing benefits for young people – @entity141 to ditching the @entity11			0
no to weakening the protections in the @entity43			0
’ the @entity16 leader also spoke of scuppering @entity6 plans to make @entity146 boundaries fairer and resisting @entity6 attempts to water down green energy plans			1
‘ no , no and no. the @entity16 will keep this government green , ’ mr @entity2 said			1
he also appeared in little doubt that the @entity16 will remain in government after the next election , declaring he could get on with either @entity152 or @entity153 – but would ‘ do a better job ’ than either of them			0
he said the @entity16 were ‘ no one ’s little brother ’ , earning the loudest cheers as he added : ‘ we ’re not here to prop up the two - party system , we ’re here to bring it down ’			0
his party represented the ‘ liberal centre ’ as the @entity6 drifted to the @entity164 and @entity165			1
he suggested coalitions are now ‘ the norm ’ for @entity169 , meaning the @entity16 could now become a fixture in power , an ‘ anchor ’ holding back both the @entity6 and @entity112			2
mr @entity2 condemned ‘ bizarre ’ @entity6 views on @entity169 ’s place in @entity175 , saying leaving would jeopardise millions of jobs and reduce its influence in the world			1
‘ we are the party of in , ’ he declared			0
mr @entity2 said ‘ vitriol ’ had been heaped upon him since he entered a power - sharing deal with mr @entity152 in 2010			2
but he insisted ‘ every snipe ’ had been worth it ‘ because we are turning @entity169 around ’			0
former @entity6 defence secretary @entity187 said of mr @entity2 ’s list of blocked policies : ‘ @entity16 are showing themselves in their true colours			1
‘ it ’s clear they ’re hugely out of step with the policies that @entity169 wants and needs			0
’ it appears @entity2 was not the only one who worked to slim down ahead of the conference			1
his wife @entity22 looked distinctly more svelte compared with last year ( right ) as she accompanied him to the keynote speech yesterday ( left )			0
mrs @entity200 stood out in a flattering £ 45.99 @entity202 coral dress cinched in with a blue belt			0
she completed her recession - inspired outfit with white @entity206 heels @entity6 mp @entity207 said : ‘ @entity2 has just exposed the worst aspects of coalition government			1
most people in my constituency would have wanted the reforms @entity2 has blocked			2
the prime minister has been governing with one arm tied behind his back			0
‘ if we could dump @entity2 and his merry band of @entity218 we would be able to get more welfare reform			2
the @entity169 public want to see a @entity169 @entity221 rather than the @entity11			0
‘ in @entity2 ’s world this list may appeal to the 8 per cent of people who vote @entity16 but in the rest of the country this is effectively an electoral suicide note			2
’ @entity228 , chairman of the backbench @entity229 , said the notion that the @entity16 should be in every government was ‘ bizarre ’ , and that the approach could backfire , adding : ‘ party leaders should be setting out the things they believe in and the things they would do if elected with a majority , not telling us what they do n’t like			0
