children born in the summer should be allowed to start school later in the year if they struggle with lessons , an education minister has admitted			2
@entity4 backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom , telling councils and headteachers to do ' what 's in the best interests of the child '			1
it follows warnings from campaigners that some local authorities made it difficult for families who want to put off joining reception classes , raising the prospect of 250,000 children having to start in @entity22			1
education minister @entity4 backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom , telling councils and headteachers to do ' what 's in the best interests of the child ' the @entity28 issued guidance to schools and councils in july 2013 and last december making it clear that there is no rule stating that a child has to be in the right school cohort for their age group			1
summer - born children can wait until the september after their fifth birthday if their parents feel they need more time to develop			0
and it suggests delaying the start of school by 12 months should be ' no barrier ' to the child then starting in reception class			1
the rule was introduced after research showed they were more likely to struggle at school , do worse in exams and have less chance of getting into university			0
but some councils are still sending youngsters straight into year 1 if their parents hold them back unless they can prove there were ' exceptional ' circumstances			0
in one high profile case , mother @entity58 is fighting for her daughter to be allowed into reception class at school a year later after she decided to delay her education because she only turned four a few weeks before school started			1
battle : @entity58 , 30 , is demanding her daughter @entity66 is allowed into reception class after she chose to exercise her right to hold her back a year because she would have started just after turning four @entity28 guidance allows parents to delay their child 's schooling until the september after their fifth birthday			1
this policy , updated last spring , is designed to help children with birthdays between april 1 and august 31			0
this is because because experts believe they are more likely to struggle academically if they start school after just turning four			0
the @entity28 guidance says : ‘ an increasing number of cases have come to the attention of the department and ministers in which parents , local authorities and admissions authorities have struggled to agree on the year group in which it is most appropriate for a summer - born child to start school			2
' there are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class '			1
but some campaigners say years of unclear and conflicting government advice on the policy has allowed schools and councils to use a loophole to push these children into @entity22 to ease pressure on places in reception			1
@entity107 says : ‘ if you choose for your child not to start until their statutory school age ... starting in a reception class following a child ’s fifth birthday is only possible in exceptional circumstances			1
’ @entity116 warns : ‘ you will need to apply for a place in @entity22			0
‘ however , the school may then be full because the places have been allocated to children in the previous school year			0
’ @entity122 , from @entity123 , was due to start primary school last september , weeks after her fourth birthday , but her parents decided to exercise their right to delay the start of her school life by 12 months			0
mrs @entity58 believes her daughter was ' not ready for school ' , and is furious her local council is now considering sending her straight into year 1 because she was held back			0
now she is fighting to allow @entity66 to start in the reception class , and will hear if she has been successful in april			1
mr @entity4 told @entity135 that there had to be ' flexibility ' from schools and councils when agreeing the start date for children who turn four just weeks before the start of the school year			1
giving evidence to the education select committee , he said : ' the key thing is flexibility , and i think that admissions authorities and headteachers do need to do what 's in the best interests of the child			0
' he added : ' if a child is very immature for their age and they are born in those summer months , and it 's the very strongly held view of the parents that the child should start school in the following september , which is when the law says they should start , i think admissions authorities should be flexible and should do what 's in the best interests of the child			0
' he stressed that councils mist include parents in discussions about when their children start school			2
but @entity174 , of the @entity173 , claimed that problems in arranging different school start times have worsened she told the committee : ' we do have a compulsory school age in @entity180 , so children should be able to start at compulsory school age			0
' she added that summer - born babies who do start school after they are five are starting at compulsory starting age and should not miss out on reception by being placed straight into @entity22			2
' parents are being forced to enrol their child in school early , prior to compulsory school age , in order to have a reasonable chance of getting a place in their preferred schools			2

@entity4 says schools and councils must do the right thing for children
official @entity203 guidance *insists* youngest *pupils* can start a year later
@entity206 says : ' no barriers to admitting child of five to reception class '
but councils have tried to say young children should start in @entity22
250,000 children may be forced to miss a year of schooling by rules
