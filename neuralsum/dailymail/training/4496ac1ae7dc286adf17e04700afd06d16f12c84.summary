by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 20:16 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 20:16 est , 6 november 2013 a report from the @entity2 , chaired by @entity3 , pictured , claimed a ' personal assistant ' signed off contracts worth more than £ 30 million as part of the @entity8 programme a ‘ personal assistant ’ signed off contracts worth more than £ 30 million as part of the government ’s flagship @entity8 programme , a report claims today			1
a damning study from @entity16 warned that the implementation of the all - in - one tax and benefits system was marred by ‘ shocking failures ’ that had wasted at least £ 140 million			1
it had been blighted by ‘ alarmingly weak ’ management with low - grade civil servants allowed to authorise payments worth millions of pounds			1
in some cases , it was unclear what suppliers had been paid for , the @entity2 said			1
the @entity29 had ‘ neglected to implement basic procedures for monitoring and authorising expenditure ’ , it alleged			0
‘ we saw evidence that purchase orders with a total value of £ 8.7 million were approved by a personal assistant to the programme director , ’ the @entity16 said			2
‘ in another case , two purchase orders , one for £ 22.6 million and one for £ 1.1 million , were approved by a personal assistant to the programme director whose delegated financial authority at the time of approvals was only £ 10 million			2
’ some individual payments to suppliers could also not be linked to pieces of work delivered			0
it programmes worth £ 140 million had to be ‘ written off ’ because they were unusable			1
mps also warned the £ 2.3 billion universal credit programme could not meet its deadline to be fully delivered by 2017			1
a pilot of the scheme was branded ‘ inadequate ’ as it was ‘ open to fraud ’			1
the trial was also limited to only the simplest new claims of those who were single and had no dependents			0
@entity8 is due to replace six means - tested benefits in four years ’ time			1
work and pensions secretary @entity61 insisting it can ensure people are always better off in jobs and save £ 38 billion by 2023			2
but @entity2 chairman , @entity66 ’s @entity3 , said the implementation so far had been ‘ extraordinarily poor ’			1
the report claimed that it programmes worth £ 140 million had to be ' written off ' because they were unusable ( file picture ) ‘ the failure to develop a comprehensive plan has led to extensive delay and the waste of a yet to be determined amount of public money , ’ she said , adding : ‘ £ 425 million has been spent so far on the programme			1
it is likely that much of this , including at least £ 140 million worth of it assets , will now have to be written off			1
the management of the programme has been alarmingly weak			1
‘ from the outset , the department has failed to grasp the nature and enormity of the task ; failed to monitor and challenge progress regularly ; and , when problems arose , failed to intervene promptly			0
‘ lack of day - to - day control meant early warning signs were missed , with senior managers becoming aware of problems only through ad hoc reviews			2
’ a spokeswoman for @entity61 , pictured , said action had been taken to fix the problems with universal credit she also attacked the department for its ‘ fortress culture ’ and deluding itself by reporting ‘ only good news ’ while ‘ problems were denied ’			0
mps said the project would not hit its current target of enrolling 184,000 claimants by april 2014			2
committee member and @entity111 mp @entity109 said : ‘ in developing it projects , government departments can no longer be allowed to mark their own homework			0
’ @entity66 ’s @entity115 , a former social security minister , said : ‘ @entity66 should show the courage to scrap this monster of a project and provide voters with a real and positive alternative - a something for something welfare state with @entity123 at its heart and a cap on means - tested benefits			1
’ a spokeswoman for @entity61 said : ‘ both the @entity129 [ @entity128 ] and the @entity2 acknowledged a fortress mentality within the [ universal credit ] programme			1
@entity61 was clear back in the summer about how he and the permanent secretary took action to fix those problems			0
he has every confidence with the team now in place , and that team includes @entity141 [ the permanent secretary ]			0
a @entity29 spokeswoman said that the department did not recognise the £ 140 million write off figure			2
she added : ‘ no contracts were signed off by a personal assistant			0
they were agreed by the relevant programme authority and the @entity148 simply completed the administration processes necessary			0
however , stronger financial controls have been put in place so that this does n’t happen again			0
’ ‘ @entity8 is a vital reform that rewards work instead of trapping people on benefits			2
it will ultimately bring a £ 38bn economic benefit to society			0
‘ this report does n’t take into account our new leadership team , or our progress on delivery			0
we have already taken comprehensive action including strengthening governance , supplier management and financial controls			0
