by @entity1 reporter published : 20:44 est , 13 october 2012 updated : 20:44 est , 13 october 2012 at first glance , a cemetery on the grounds of a former boys ’ reform school is nothing more than what it appears , marking graves of former students who died during influenza outbreaks and fires with simple metal crosses			1
but now investigators believe that there may be more bodies near the site where 31 white crosses mark where bodies of students of the @entity22 were laid to rest			1
though the school was shuttered last year and a 2009 investigation cleared the school of any criminal wrongdoing with the 31 unidentified boys , the bodies of up to 50 other students have not been accounted for			1
though a @entity51 from 2009 concluded that the 31 graves on site held victims of the flu and those who died in a 1914 fire , the story the former students tell is much more sinister			1
anthropologist @entity59 , from the @entity60 , is working with a team of experts to search the grounds , located on the @entity34 panhandle			2
dr @entity59 told @entity65 that of 100 children who died while at the school , no burial records exist for 22 of the boys			2
some students , now long past boyhood , said of how boys at the institution were raped and beaten without mercy			1
they call the whitewashed cinder block shed where they were beaten the ' @entity78 , ' and call themselves the @entity22			1
@entity80 , now 83 , said that her brother , @entity81 , was sent to the @entity22 for boys in the spring of 1940 , after running away from home and later stealing and wrecking a car			1
correctional facility : the school was in operation from the beginning of the 20th century until a few years ago more bodies : an investigation by the @entity60 reveals that there may be more bodies in unmarked graves ; bits of red are likely human remains according to a 2009 letter written by @entity99 , the family never heard from @entity81 again			1
she said that her mother wrote to the school to inquire about her son ’s whereabouts , but was told @entity81 escaped			0
lost : @entity81 died in 1940 , though accounts of his death are unclear ; his sister thinks he was killed at the school the school then said he was caught and captured by the sheriff ’s department			2
when their father came to claim his son , he was told that he was sent back to @entity112			0
it is unclear what then happened to @entity81			0
mrs @entity80 said that she talked to a former student who said that he saw @entity81 being taken into what was known as the @entity78 , a place where boys were disciplined on campus			1
she wrote : ‘ when they brought him out , they were carrying him			0
the boy said they heard his screams and that he was taken to the infirmary			0
’ mrs @entity80 ’s mother continued to write to the detention centre for months , until the school finally said that @entity81 ’s badly decomposed body had been found under a house			2
the school said that he had most likely died of pneumonia and was under the house to try to keep warm			0
however , the doctor and lawyer living in the house told mrs @entity80 that they never heard or smelled anything			0
mrs @entity80 told @entity65 that she hopes to give her brother the burial he deserves			0
‘ i would take him and put him down with my mom and dad in their cemetery , ’ she explained			0
‘ i hope i get the chance			0
