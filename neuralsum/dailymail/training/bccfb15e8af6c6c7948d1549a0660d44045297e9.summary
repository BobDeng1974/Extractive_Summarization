by @entity0 , @entity2 political editor and @entity3 president @entity4 told his @entity6 counterpart @entity5 on wednesday that he ' must halt the flow of weapons and fighters ' into @entity10 as the @entity2 imposed tough new sanctions on @entity12			1
the tough action , in the form of new sanctions on @entity6 's lucrative energy and defense companies as well as a handful of @entity6 banks , was announced by @entity4 in a half - empty @entity21 press briefing room on wednesday			1
it came as his administration struggled for a way to quell a @entity12 - backed insurgency in eastern @entity10			2
the penalties , which @entity4 said were a response to @entity6 's ' provocations in @entity10 , ' significantly expand on previous @entity2 sanctions , which were limited to @entity6 individuals and companies			1
' @entity6 must halt the flow of weapons and fighters across the border in @entity10 ' and pursue international talks , @entity4 said			2
' i 've made this clear directly to mr. @entity5 , ' his counterpart in @entity12			1
president @entity4 escalated @entity2 sanctions against @entity6 on wednesday in response to the crisis in @entity10 unrest : smoke from a mortar attack rises above @entity45 during clashes between @entity10 troops and @entity49 fighters the president said his administration was ' designating selected sectors of the @entity6 economy as eligible for sanctions , ' and then applying ' significant but ... also targeted ' sanctions to companies in those sectors			1
' we have to see concrete actions and not just words that @entity6 is in fact committed to end this conflict along the @entity6 - @entity10 border , ' he told reporters			0
' there are some clear steps that we 've asked @entity6 to take that they have n't taken , ' @entity21 press secretary @entity64 told reporters on wednesday			0
' and that is what has elevated the risk that @entity6 faces right now as it relates to additional economic costs that could be imposed by the international community , ' @entity2 officials said earlier in the day that they were continuing to hold in reserve a strategy that would cripple entire market sectors in @entity6 , in case @entity12 launches a full - scale invasion of @entity10			1
@entity4 warned that with a new round of financial penalties , ' what we are expecting is that the @entity6 leaders will see once again that their actions in @entity10 have consequences			1
' the @entity2 will continue to help @entity10 ' defend its territorial integrity , ' he vowed			0
hours earlier , the @entity87 listed the @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and the @entity91 among the sanctioned entities			0
they are among @entity6 's largest business entities , but will no longer be permitted to borrow funds on the @entity2 market for medium - and long - term periods of over 90 days , the @entity93 reported shortly after a closed @entity21 conference call with journalists			0
the companies will still be able to conduct overnight loans and other short - term banking business			0
during the same brief press conference , @entity4 announced that @entity104 had agreed to abide by the results of an international audit of its recent presidential election			2
he added the @entity2 continues ' to support diplomatic efforts to end the violence between @entity111 and @entity112			0
' ' @entity111 has a right to defend itself from rocket attacks that terrorize the @entity111 people , ' @entity4 declared			2
' there is no country on earth that can be expected to live under a daily barrage of rockets , and i 'm proud that the @entity122 that @entity2 helped @entity111 develop and fund has saved many @entity111 lives			0
' but he condemned ' the death and injury of so many innocent civilians in @entity129 – men , women and children caught in the crossfire , ' and said he would continue to pursue a diplomatic peace			0
@entity4 also added that he was considering an extension of friday 's deadline for @entity137 to make good on its commitments to halt its nuclear weapons program			1
' based on consultations with secretary [ @entity144 ] @entity143 and my national security team , it 's clear we 've made real progress , ' @entity4 said , while acknowledging that gaps remain between @entity2 's expectations and what @entity137 has delivered to date			1
the president took no questions after he finished reading his statement , and said nothing as a reporter shouted a question about whether he would hit @entity137 with sanctions similar to those he was leveling on @entity6			0
campaign : protesters rally against @entity10 military action in @entity162 on july 6 after the country tried to seize back more territory from rebels conflict : @entity10 troops move armored vehicles closer to @entity169 as the government searches for @entity49 activists blamed for the deaths of 23 servicemen earlier this month the @entity2 announcement came as @entity176 leaders met into the night in @entity177 to discuss taking their own measures aimed at helping ease tensions along @entity6 's border with @entity10			1
@entity182 diplomats were also looking at penalties that would go beyond the current travel bans and asset freezes against individuals , though it was unclear whether their sanctions would go as far the @entity2 until now , the @entity2 has insisted on hitting @entity6 with penalties in concert with @entity176 in order to maximize the impact and present a united western front			1
the @entity182 has a far stronger economic relationship with @entity6 , making the 28 - nation bloc 's participation key to ensuring sanctions packages have enough teeth to deter @entity6			1
but those same economic ties have made @entity176 fearful that tougher penalties could boomerang and hurt their own economies			1
the @entity21 's willingness to punish @entity6 without @entity176 backing comes as the @entity4 administration faces criticism that its repeated warnings about tougher sanctions are little more than empty threats			2
' sometimes i 'm embarrassed for you , as you constantly talk about sanctions and yet , candidly , we never see them put in place , ' @entity210 senator @entity209 said during a @entity218 hearing on @entity10 with administration officials last week			0
@entity4 said he was considering an extension of friday 's deadline for @entity137 to show it had halted its nuclear weapons program , but ignored a reporter 's shouted question about whether he might impose new economic sanctions on the @entity227 republic the @entity2 and @entity176 have levied coordinated sanctions on @entity6 individuals and companies connected to @entity12 's alleged destabilization in @entity10			1
@entity4 administration officials argue that those penalties have had an impact on @entity6 's economy , citing @entity237 statistics showing a downgrade in @entity6 's growth this year			2
however , officials have acknowledged that the sanctions have not had an impact on @entity5 's decision - making in @entity10			2
@entity245 spokesman @entity244 said tuesday that if @entity5 ' cares deeply about his people , about the economy , his own country ' the sanctions would shift his calculus			2
but @entity6 deputy foreign minister @entity251 blasted the @entity2 in the wee hours of thursday morning in @entity12 , warning that a @entity6 retaliation could be ' quite painful and serious			2
' ' the new decision by the @entity2 administration to lodge sanctions under false pretenses against a number of @entity6 businesses and individuals ca n’t be called anything other than outrageous and totally unacceptable , ' @entity251 told the @entity262 news service			0
@entity4 and @entity176 counterparts have vowed to take even broader sanctions targeting @entity6 's lucrative energy and defense sectors , as well as access to financial markets , if @entity12 failed to quell tensions with @entity10			1
but it is unclear what the new package of @entity2 sanctions would include			0
during a @entity277 meeting in @entity177 in early june , @entity275 leaders warned @entity6 president @entity5 those penalties could be levied within a month if @entity6 did not meet specific conditions			1
unmoved : president @entity5 has so far failed to react to threats of sanctions from @entity176 and the @entity2 the conditions included recognizing the results of @entity10 's may 25 election and starting a dialogue with president @entity287 , ending support for the @entity49 insurgency in eastern @entity10 and stopping the flow of arms across the @entity6 border			0
the end - of - june deadline the @entity294 outlined for @entity5 came and went with little follow - through from @entity6 , yet no penalties were levied by the @entity2 and @entity176			1
@entity297 , director of the @entity176 program at the @entity299 , said the @entity294 's failure to follow through on its threat of sector sanctions has raised a ' credibility question ' for the @entity4 administration			1
' i think the bluff has now been fully called , ' @entity305 said			0
if @entity4 moves forward with unilateral sanctions , he will face opposition from the private sector			0
@entity2 businesses have been pressing the administration to hold off on sanctions that could put them at a disadvantage in the global economy			0
' it 's not clear to us that breaking commercial ties with the @entity6 partners , consumers gets anyone to where they want to be , ' said @entity325 , vice president for international strategic initiatives at the @entity2 @entity326 .			0
