it 's no doubt tiring work roaming the sun - drenched plains of @entity5 's @entity4			1
luckily for this lioness , nature provided the perfect spot to recharge her batteries			2
@entity12 photographer @entity11 captured the amusing sight of the sleepy animal letting all four limbs hang down from a tree branch as she dozed in the afternoon sun. do not disturb : photographer @entity11 got within 20 metres of the lioness but she did n't seem to notice branching out : mr @entity11 said it was rare for lions to climb trees - at least while they were being watched mr @entity11 , who is an experienced safari travel guide for photographers , got within 20 metres of the animal to take the photograph and said he has never seen anything like it before			1
' when i noticed her she was already lying on the tree ' , he explained			2
' in my presence she was asleep for about 10 minutes , then she woke up and started changing poses			0
' it was late in the day around 5.30pm and she was sleeping			0
' a brief paws : mr @entity11 said ' if the tourists behave calmly , the animals do not pay attention to the people ' cat napping : the lioness eventually opened her eyes to find she was the centre of attention @entity11 left @entity12 in 2002 to travel the world , embarking on photography tours in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
he was on one such photo tour in @entity5 when he spotted the lioness			0
@entity11 , 42 , added : ' in @entity5 wild animals get used to the tourists so if the tourists behave calmly , the animals do not pay attention to the people			1
' @entity60 climbing the trees is a rare phenomenon - at least while they are being watched			0
' perhaps they do this because after seasonal rainfall , grass in the savannah is long so it could be easier for the lions to notice the prey when they are up on a tree			0
' it means it can be a sort of observation point - and watching it made me smile			0
' balancing act : mr @entity11 said that lions sometimes use trees as an observation point when the grass is long sitting pretty : the lioness was asleep for 10 minutes before she changed her position			1
