nuclear submarines are renowned for their enormous size and range of capabilities including operating for extended periods underwater			2
but now a company has unveiled a diesel electric submarine that can rival these bigger counterparts in size and ability			2
called the @entity11 , it is so advanced that it can stay submerged for three weeks and could cross the @entity12 six times without surfacing			1
their concept for a new submarine aims to replace nuclear vessels			1
they say this sub is just as big and even more capable			2
it can stay submerged for three weeks and has 34 weapons on board the advanced submarine was built by @entity16 naval defence company the @entity15			1
it is 330ft ( 100 metres long ) , 50.9ft ( 15.5 metres ) high and 28.9ft ( 8.8 metres ) across			0
on board it has a total of 34 weapons including torpedos , mines , anti-ship missiles , cruise missiles and anti-air missiles			1
this means it can attack targets across four areas : underwater , surface , land and air			0
length : 330ft ( 100 metres ) height : 50.9ft ( 15.5 metres ) @entity49 : 28.9ft ( 8.8 metres ) surface displacement : 4,750 tons maximum diving depth : 1,150ft ( 350 metres ) maximum speed , submerged : 20 knots range : 18,000 miles ( 29,000km ) but it represents a breakthrough in submarine technology , as previously nothing had been able to compete with nuclear vessels			1
in order to be as capable as nuclear submarines it uses something known as @entity63 ( @entity63 )			2
this technology allows a non-nuclear submarine to operate without needing access to atmospheric oxygen for long periods of time			0
this enables it to remain underwater they basically work by using a diesel engine operated conventionally on the surface but , underwater , they are supplied with an oxidant ( such as liquid oxygen ) that keeps them running			0
the @entity11 also uses a quieter form of propulsion that makes it less noisy			1
there 's no word yet on when such a submarine might enter service though			1
its array of weapons means it could attack targets across four areas : underwater , surface , land and air ( pictured is an animation of a missile hitting the ground ) one of the benefits of using @entity63 over nuclear propulsion is that nuclear submarines must constantly pump coolant , which can be noisy			1
@entity63 submarines can be almost entirely silent and are therefore much more stealthy			0
according to @entity103 for @entity104 , the @entity11 is intended to eliminate the remaining advantages of nuclear submarines			0
it uses the latest @entity63 technologies in its larger hull design , namely the latest in fuel cell and lithium - ion batteries			0
this allows the boat to stay submerged for 21 days and remain out at sea for 90 days without coming in to port			1
this gives it the option of performing ‘ blue water ’ ( open ocean ) operations as opposed to just ‘ brown water ’ ( on the coast )			0
amazingly the submarine even has unmanned underwater vehicles ( @entity127 ) and unmanned air vehicles ( @entity129 ) it can deploy and go out of its range of operation			0
' the @entity11 is most likely a vision of things to come in regards to subsurface warfare technology , ' mr @entity103 wrote			0
' as nuclear submarine technology becomes increasingly unaffordable for even the most wealthy states , their capabilities will have to be shared by cheaper diesel - electric aip boats			2

@entity16 defence company @entity15 has unveiled the @entity17
their concept for a new submarine aims to replace nuclear vessels
