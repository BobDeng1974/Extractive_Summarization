@entity0 climbed above rivals @entity1 on saturday night into third place in the @entity4 table after a 3 - 1 victory over @entity6			1
@entity7 opened the scoring before half time and @entity10 made it two after the interval with a superb second before @entity13 pulled one back for @entity16 's side			1
but midfielder @entity7 added his second and @entity0 's third late on to secure the three points for @entity0			0
here , @entity20 's @entity19 gives his player ratings from @entity22			0
@entity0 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) @entity23 – one of the quietest afternoons he has had all season ; perhaps that explained his aberration for @entity6 ’s goal – 6 @entity29 – @entity30 down the right flank , almost created a goal for @entity10 with one surge ; not tested defensively – 7.5 @entity0 pair @entity34 ( left ) and @entity29 ( right ) battle @entity13 for the ball @entity34 – with @entity6 offering no threat , the @entity38 international was able to engage cruise control			1
had @entity13 under - wraps – 7 @entity42 – elegant on the ball , passed it well and came close to opening the scoring with a 30 - yard drive that fizzed over the bar – 7 @entity48 – @entity49 looks comfortable regardless of the position he plays ; a professional job in a professional performance – 6.5 @entity7 – to think there was a time when he could n’t get a game			0
passing was excellent and his two goals were thoroughly deserved – 8.5 @entity0 midfielder @entity7 celebrates opening the scoring against @entity6 @entity62 – having a renaissance this season after disappearing under @entity65 ; kept things simple and smooth – 7 @entity67 – he bullied @entity68 in his last performance but was n’t so aggressive here ; could have scored with a second half header – 6.5 @entity72 – no repeat of his @entity75 heroics			2
flitted in and out of the game , some nice moments but times when he disappeared – 6.5 @entity72 in action for @entity0 against @entity6 at @entity22 on saturday @entity81 – had the bit between his teeth against his old club ; came close to a goal with a flashing drive in the second half – 7.5 @entity10 – captain led by example and scored a quite magnificent half - volley to give @entity0 an unassailable lead – 7 @entity10 ( centre ) celebrates his goal with team - mates @entity95 ( left ) and @entity7 @entity97 @entity98 ( for @entity81 ) 70mins @entity95 ( for @entity67 ) 77mins unused @entity99 ( gk ) , @entity100 , @entity98 , @entity95 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 @entity6 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity104 – earned his keep with saves from @entity42 , @entity106 , @entity10 and @entity67 ; could n’t do anything about @entity7 ’s goal – 7 @entity109 – substituted at half - time with an injury			1
had previously found it hard work trying to contain @entity81 – 5.5 @entity114 – powerless to stop @entity10 scoring a magnificent second ; not a great impact on the game – 5.5 @entity6 defender @entity114 ( left ) vies for the ball with @entity0 captain @entity10 @entity119 – fortunate to escape in the fourth minute when wrestling @entity10 to the floor ; could easily have been sent - off – 6 @entity122 – playing out of position on the left and it was heavy weather at times when @entity72 started running at him – 5.5 @entity129 – seemed his job was more centred on stopping @entity0 attacking rather than on going forward himself – 5.5 @entity132 – lots of energy in the middle but offered nothing to get @entity6 going forward ; difficult afternoon – 6 @entity137 – had his work cut out trying to keep @entity7 in check			2
never had chance to get @entity6 moving forward – 6.5 @entity6 midfielder @entity137 ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity81 of @entity0 @entity143 – did n’t make much of a contribution going forward and had little influence on the game ; substituted late on – 6 @entity13 – threw his side a late lifeline when benefitting from a rare @entity150 lapse ; it was the only chance he got – 6.5 @entity6 striker @entity13 ( left ) celebrates scoring against @entity0 @entity97 @entity151 ( for @entity152 77mins ) unused given ( gk ) , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity151 , @entity156 , @entity157			0

@entity7 impresses with two goals for @entity0 in victory
@entity10 also finds the back of the net against @entity6 in 3 - 1 win
@entity104 the best performer for @entity16 's side at @entity22
