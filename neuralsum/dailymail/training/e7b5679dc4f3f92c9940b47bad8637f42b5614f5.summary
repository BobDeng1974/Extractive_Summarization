a shot at market success : @entity2 will stock coffee capsules from a rival to @entity7 's successful @entity6 pod system			1
file picture struggling supermarket giant @entity2 has signed a deal with a rival of @entity7 's lucrative @entity6 coffee capsules			1
@entity12 will soon be sold in 650 stores throughout the @entity14			1
the @entity16 , @entity17 - based brand was set up three years ago and already has its product on the shelves at @entity20 and is sold through major online retailers			0
@entity2 which has been losing ground to both discount stores like @entity24 and upmarket rivals like @entity20 , will be keen to dip into this profitable market			1
sales of coffee capsules , or pods , in western @entity30 almost doubled over the past four years , to £ 3.3bn , according to @entity31			1
worldwide , the market is estimated at £ 8.2bn			2
a free - for - all was sparked after @entity7 , the world 's biggest food and drinks company , lost its patent covering the @entity6 coffee system after a lengthy legal battle			1
now other manufacturers can produce pods that can be used in @entity7 's machines , such as @entity12			1
@entity6 , known for its slick advertising featuring @entity42 actor @entity41 , is one of @entity7 's fastest - growing brands and has an estimated £ 3.3billion in sales every year			1
@entity46 , the @entity47 entrepreneur behind @entity12 , told the @entity48 : ' @entity2 recognised that we were the first coffee capsule brand to the @entity14 multiples market			1
' at the time we were the only brand listed at @entity20 , and so the leader in our field			0
' suave : the @entity6 advertising campaign features actor and director @entity41 the seeds for the deal were sown when the retailer approached @entity12 at the 2013 @entity59			1
@entity6 has fought tooth and nail to protect @entity6			0
in april last year , a @entity14 court ruled that a @entity14 manufacturer of coffee pods compatible with @entity6 machines was not infringing patents			1
in october the @entity67 revoked a @entity7 patent covering a mechanism in @entity6 machines in another attempt to cut competitors out of the market			1
coffee fans get can their fix anywhere thanks to the world ’s first disposable coffee machine			2
the innovative product works like a teabag for coffee and promises to brew a quality cup just by adding hot water to the bag			2
the water mixes with ground coffee then drips through a special filter into another chamber , from which is can be poured into cups			2
designer @entity89 came up with the idea from studying teabags after running out of coffee filters for his home coffee machine			2
he has spent the last nine years developing the product , called @entity96 , which has just launched in @entity14 , and said it can be used in a range of situations from at home and in the office to outdoors			1
@entity89 , 46 , from @entity103 in the @entity104 , said : ' it all started one morning when i went to make myself a cup of coffee and realised i had run out of filters for my machine			0
' i needed my coffee fix and i was getting annoyed that it was so difficult to make a decent cup of coffee			0
' as i slammed the kitchen draw shut i noticed some tea bags and i started thinking about why there was n’t a similar product for coffee			0
' i cut up a few tea bags and put coffee grounds inside them and found there was some potential for a similar product so i started doing research into it			0
' yesterday it emerged that @entity2 is launching a massive counter-offensive against pound shop stores as it battles to stem the loss of customers to budget outlets			0
the nation ’s biggest retailer has begun opening heavily - promoted ' pound shop ' areas within its stores in a bid to take on thriving @entity140 and other low - cost chains			2
the new zones have so far been introduced to more than 60 @entity2 stores , and the retailer plans to increase this figure to nearly 300 over the next few weeks			0
@entity24 ’s sales growth has accelerated to 34 per cent a year , while takings through the tills at @entity149 are rising by an impressive 17 per cent			0
the budget chains have made a concerted effort to target middle @entity14 shoppers who have seen prices rise faster than incomes for the last five years			2
they have become known for produce , cheap dairy products and top @entity30 food and wine			2
current @entity14 market share of the major supermarkets shows @entity2 is still dominant but cheaper options are on the rise @entity24 and @entity149 are targeting people with everything from fresh @entity167 fillet steaks at £ 5 each to award winning wine , coffee and cheese			1
and own - label tablets from @entity149 and @entity24 came second and third respectively in recent tests for the best dishwasher tablets by consumer watchdog which ? – and they were among the cheapest at 10p per wash			0
but while the @entity177 chains open shops at the rate of one a week , @entity2 continues to lose sales despite a £ 1billion turnaround plan			0
its sales in the 12 weeks to april were down by 3 per cent on a year ago			0
last month it was revealed that @entity2 's profits had fallen for the second year running as its rivals continue to eat into its market share , which is at a ten - year low			1
@entity14 's biggest supermarket posted a six per cent fall in its pre-tax profits to £ 3.3billion in the past 12 months , down from £ 3.45billion a year earlier			1
@entity2 is still by far the biggest @entity14 supermarket with 28.6 per cent of market share , but this is down from 29.7 per cent a year ago			1
@entity194 had 17.4 per cent , @entity193 's had 16.5 per cent and @entity195 had 11.1 per cent in the year ending march 30			0
but all have faced a surge from competitors gobbling up customers , with @entity24 's share of the market up from 3.4 per cent to 4.6 per cent in the past 12 months			0
@entity20 had 5 per cent compared with 4.8 per cent last year , and @entity149 also experienced strong growth in a record - breaking month and now accounts for 3.4 per cent of the market			2
there is also a perception that with stores such as @entity20 clearly high - end , and @entity149 and @entity24 clearly low - end , @entity2 is losing out on shoppers because it is sitting in the middle ground			0
meanwhile in january , @entity208 , who founded @entity140 in 1990 , revealed plans for an online store where everything costs £ 1			0
the minimum order value is likely to be £ 23 , and a ' click - and - collect ' system is being considered , which would allow customers to pick up their goods at other stores and shopping centres .			0

@entity219 will sell @entity12 at 650 of its stores across the @entity14
the coffee capsule sector is worth billions in @entity30
@entity7 lost a *key* patent last year , opening the market to rivals
