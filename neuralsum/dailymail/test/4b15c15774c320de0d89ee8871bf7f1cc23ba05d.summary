a mother - of - four whose addiction to @entity2 saw her drinking 24 cans of a day claims she has been cured of her habit by hypnosis			1
@entity9 , 31 , became so dependent on the energy drink she was told if she cut down too quickly she could suffer a seizure as her body was so used to the caffeine			1
the law student spent a staggering £ 5,460 every year on the popular energy drink since she became hooked in 2009			1
she soon became dependent on the drink and could n't get out of bed unless she knew she had some in the fridge			2
she also became lethargic , depressed , had heart palpitations and was constantly feeling anxious as her £ 105 - a - week habit spiralled out of control			1
she finally decided to do something about the problem after she realised the constant need for the @entity2 was severely damaging her health			0
and after seeing hypnotherapist earlier this month , she claims she has been cured of her addiction thanks to just one 50 - minute session			1
her habit had been so dangerous she needed to cut down to eight cans a day in the run up to the hypnosis - as coming off so much caffeine abruptly could have caused a seizure			1
a 250ml can of @entity2 contains : 80mg of caffeine - the same amount as in an espresso			2
27.5g sucrose and glucose combined - the equivalent of almost seven teaspoons of sugar			2
@entity47 ( an amino acid that is thought to boost athletic performance )			0
ms @entity9 's 24 - a - day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day			1
a 2005 study into caffeine - related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose , suggesting she was taking nearly half the potentially lethal dose			2
ms @entity9 , from @entity58 , said : ' i was studying for a @entity60 in law in 2005 and used to have the odd @entity2 for a pick me up			2
' it is hard to say when it became every day but i remember that by 2009 i was definitely hooked			2
' whenever i felt tired having a @entity2 would be the first thing i would do			0
' it was worst in 2010 when i was doing law exams at university and my children were off school			0
' sometimes i would have exams day after day - and with the stress of revising i was having 24 cans a day			1
' i was pulling all - nighters and using the drinks to stay awake			0
in the end , it got to the point where i just needed @entity2 to function			0
' i used to get my shopping delivered and used to have four or five crates and that only lasted for a week - it got out of hand			0
' there would be times when i would get palpitations and shakes but i think i just got used to the caffeine			0
' @entity2 - whose slogan says the drink ' gives you wings ' - is made by an @entity94 company and is the highest selling energy drink in the world			1
miss @entity9 claims she was cured of her addiction in one 50 minutes hypnotherapy session with @entity99 ( pictured right ) this table shows a range of drinks in order of caffeine content and their relation to daily allowances			1
ms @entity9 was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day , way above the recommended limit of 400 mg the drink has been branded safe by the @entity112 ( @entity112 ) and more than five billion cans were sold in 2013			1
however , it has been criticised for its high caffeine levels with one 250ml can containing 80mg , similar to one cup of coffee			0
ms @entity9 's 24 - a - day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of the drug every day			1
a 2005 study into caffeine - related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose , suggesting she was taking nearly half of a lethal dose			0
but , incredibly , she claims she was completely cured of her addiction after a single session with cognitive behavioral hypnotherapist @entity99 on april 11			1
ms @entity9 , who lives with boyfriend @entity129 , 27 , and four children aged between three and 14 , added : ' i knew at the start of this year it was a dependency so thought i would give hypnotherapy a go			1
' it was a weird process , i felt like i was in there for 15 minutes but it was 50 minutes			0
' all i can remember is that it was like a kaleidoscope effect , i remember him saying i did n't need @entity2			0
' ' i am convinced i wo n't have another can			0
i feel like a different person , ' ms @entity9 said after undergoing hypnotherapy to cure her of her energy drink habit she added : ' it was like a paralysis because i had an itch , but could n't move to scratch it			1
' it gave me a lot of strength because in the past i have tried to give up but lasted a week and then gone back to the @entity2			0
' i am convinced i wo n't have another can			0
i feel like a different person			0
' hypnotherapist mr @entity99 added : ' @entity9 's addiction was very serious			2
' coming off that amount of caffeine and taurine can lead to seizures , so she gradually reduced her intake before coming to me to make a safe escape			0
' energy drink addicts can also suffer insomnia , depression , anxiety and heart palpitations			1
' luckily @entity9 soldiered through and has been amazed at the changes			2
