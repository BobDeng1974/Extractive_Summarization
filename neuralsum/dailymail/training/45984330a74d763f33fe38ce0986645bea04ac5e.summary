a @entity1 woman has lived to the age of 24 with part of her brain missing , before the extremely rare condition was detected			1
doctors at the @entity7 of @entity8 in the @entity9 made the discovery when the woman visited medics complaining of nausea and dizziness			1
scans revealed the woman had been born with a cerebellum - the part of the brain responsible for posture , balance , motor learning like kicking a ball , and speech			1
while it is not unknown for a person to lose partial function of the cerebellum due to an injury or disease , completely lacking the region in the first place is extremely rare			2
physicians believe the woman is only the ninth known case of a living person suffering the condition cerebellar agenesis			1
doctors learned the woman had never played or jumped like other children her age , and is unable to walk steadily without support tests revealed she had no problem understanding words but living without a cerebellum meant she had difficulties with pronunciation			2
her voice trembles , her words are slurred and the doctors treating the 24 - year - old described her voice tone as ' harsh '			1
specialists discovered the space where the cerebellum should be was empty			0
instead , the black space was filled with cerebrospinal fluid , which cushions the brain , providing defence against disease			0
doctors believe the woman is one of just nine people in the world known to have suffered the extremely rare condition cerebellar agenesis			1
file picture shows how a fully - formed brain should look doctors treated her with a dehydration treatment to remove some of the water pressure building up in her brain			0
@entity96 , who researches cerebellar disorders at the @entity98 in @entity99 , told the new scientist : ' these rare cases are interesting to understand how the brain circuitry works and compensates for missing parts			2
' the doctors looking after the patient , said they believe the normal cerebellar function may have been taken over by the cortex			0
at a follow - up appointment four years later she was showing signs of doing well , it was reported in the journal @entity113			0
the woman married , and gave birth to a daughter with no neurological abnormalities			0
while the majority of people born with the rare condition will die in infancy , the patient represents a new opportunity to study the effects of living without the cerebellum .			0

@entity1 woman visited doctor complaining of nausea and dizziness
a @entity134 and @entity135 scan revealed the 24 - year - old was missing a cerebellum
the region of the brain is responsible for posture , balance , motor learning *including* learning to jump and kick a ball and speech
it is located at the base of the skull and contains half the brain 's neurons - cells that transmit *chemical* and *electrical* signals
she is one of nine people in the world thought to suffer cerebellar agenesis
