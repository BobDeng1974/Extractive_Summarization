as @entity3 ’s @entity2 acts go , she was certainly a conversation starter – a ‘ talking ’ dog with singing skills and a sense of humour			0
but some viewers at home were less dazzled by miss @entity11 's false mouth trick - and questioned the effect of the ' cruel ' stunt on the dog			1
after saturday 's episode of the show , broadcasting regulator @entity17 received 21 complaints over the talking dog , while @entity20 received a further 35			0
the @entity21 yesterday said it would be contacting @entity3 ’s @entity2 ‘ to ascertain what methods were used ’ in the performance			1
‘ distress could result from her being unable to breathe or pant properly whilst wearing a mask on stage – in an environment which can get very warm , it is essential that panting is not restricted			0
’ one viewer wrote on on @entity58 : ‘ that ’s not talent [ and it ] should be looked into for animal abuse			0
’ others said the act was cruel			2
but @entity65 ventriloquist @entity64 insisted that @entity11 ‘ loves performing ’			2
‘ i ’ve been working with @entity11 since she was a puppy , ’ he said			2
‘ i would never put her in a situation that would cause her distress			0
she gets excited when we go to work and is always comfortable on stage			0
’ @entity3 ’s @entity2 also defended the act , with a spokesman saying @entity21 guidelines were consulted during the audition process			1
‘ we are comfortable that mr @entity64 ’s act complies with the guidelines and we look forward to hearing from the @entity21 to talk through the methods used , ’ he added			1
@entity36 has always dismissed claims that having animals on the show is cruel			1
he has previously said : ‘ @entity83 no , i think the opposite ! we show animals ’ personalities			0
agreement : @entity28 and @entity11 received a standing ovation on saturday and progressed to the semi-finals - with @entity90 telling him he had made tv history ‘ i think they all have a great time on our show , you can see the dogs are wagging their tails			1
’ perched high on a silver plinth , miss @entity11 shared a joke with her owner and serenaded the judges with a rendition of 1970s classic feelings during saturday 's episode , which was watched by 11m viewers			1
the audience roared with laughter as she argued with @entity65 ventriloquist @entity64 – and all four judges were so impressed they sent the pair straight through to the next round			0
old dog old trick ? in 2012 , a contestant on @entity116 , @entity114 astounded judges with his talking @entity65 bulldog , @entity119 ( pictured ) but in case you were wondering just how easy it is to teach a dog to talk , the trick behind the act can be revealed with a quick look at the @entity20 show ’s archives			1
a similar illusion was used on @entity116 in 2012 , when contestant @entity114 appeared to make his @entity65 bulldog speak			1
it involves fitting a fake snout over the nose of the animal , which is then controlled remotely to make the artificial mouth open in time with the routine			0
to make it seem more realistic , the breathable snout is covered in fur exactly the same colour as that of the dog			0
and the novelty clearly had n’t worn off by saturday night , as @entity36 seemed particularly astounded by the performance of 61 - year - old mr @entity64 and his pet			1
@entity90 told her @entity65 owner that he had ' made television history ' and @entity36 phoned his girlfriend @entity148 to tell her about it			1
@entity150 said to mr @entity28 : ' congratulations , in the nine years of doing this show , @entity36 has said he wanted a dog that could meow or sing , and you did both , incredible			1
' @entity36 commented : ' wow , i do n't know how she does that			2
how does she know the words ? unbelievable			0
' @entity28 and @entity11 received a standing ovation on saturday and progressed to the semi-finals			1
on saturday another act shocked @entity36 when a fearless free - runner pretended to be injured after plunging from a balcony during a terrifying routine			1
look out below : @entity169 's jaw - dropping audition saw him pretend to fall over as he jumped from the balcony ouch : he went to put on a dazzling display on the stage as he ended his audience with an impressive jump over @entity176 @entity36 , who earlier in the week conned @entity90 into thinking she was being dumped from the show for @entity178 , was left open - mouthed when 20 - year - old @entity169 , from @entity179 , leapt around the stage			1
@entity36 asked @entity169 : ' @entity83 , @entity169 are you really ok ? ' as he lay on the theatre floor after diving from a balcony			2
the 20 - year - old , also leapt over show hosts @entity176 on stage , also impressed @entity90 , who told him : ' we have never seen anything as brave and dangerous before '			1
but not everyone on the panel was won over , with @entity192 joking : ' jumping over two people who are that short is n't really such a big deal			0
' amazing : @entity3 's @entity2 started with a bang on saturday when @entity36 pressed his @entity196 in the first round of auditions as he put singing through singer @entity199 you 're in : receiving not only a standing ovation , he also got a golden buzzer from @entity36 as his sister was able to move past her exit and give her brother a hug later @entity36 pressed his @entity196 in the first round of auditions as he put singing through singer @entity199			1
@entity199 , 26 , had come along to audition for the @entity20 talent competition with his sister who failed to impress the judges while her brother went on to wow @entity36			2
the recruitment officer from @entity212 , had to go on stage after watching his sister 's audition go wrong , and he performed @entity216 by @entity217			0
receiving not only a standing ovation , he also got a @entity196 from @entity36 , causing his sister to run on stage and give her brother a proud hug			2
@entity36 revealed why he pressed the buzzer saying : ' i 've never ever in all the years i 've done this show heard a guy with the talent you 've got '			2
at the start of the show , @entity36 was seen driving his fellow judges to the auditions			0
well , that 's different : the show kicked off with 42 - year - old @entity233			0
the it consultant certainly started things off in a unique style as he played his instrument – which turned out to be a comb helping out : he immediately received a buzz from @entity36 before he was joined on stage by hosts @entity176 as they played @entity243 by @entity244 the show kicked off with 42 - year - old @entity233			1

but viewers said act was ' cruel ' while @entity21 said it would work to ' ascertain what methods were used '
@entity36 called act ' incredible ' - @entity90 said : ' you made tv history '
but similar act was seen on @entity116 in @entity271 in 2012
