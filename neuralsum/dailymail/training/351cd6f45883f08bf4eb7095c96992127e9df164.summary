the boss of @entity1 was last night facing questions over his secretive tax affairs after claiming he sheltered money in a @entity6 bank account to prevent prying colleagues from finding out his bonus			1
speaking publicly for the first time since revelations about @entity1 ’s @entity6 private bank , @entity10 described his ‘ shame ’ at allegations that the lender routinely helped clients including arms dealers and blood diamond smugglers evade taxes			1
but he was also forced to defend his own finances after leaked documents revealed he sheltered some £ 5million in bonuses in an @entity1 account in @entity6 under the name of a @entity27 company			1
leaked files reportedly show that @entity10 ( pictured ) , chief executive since 2011 , held £ 5million in the bank 's @entity30 - based subsidiary that was at the centre of a huge tax avoidance scandal this lasted from 1998 until 2011 , when he became chief executive and his pay details had to be published anyway			1
last night one accountant described the complex arrangement in @entity6 as a ‘ classic case of tax avoidance ’			2
the @entity1 boss was also facing questions after revealing that he is domiciled in @entity44 for tax purposes despite being born in @entity46 and living in the @entity47			1
mr @entity10 , 55 , said the computer systems on the trading floor enabled staff to find out how much their colleagues were being paid in bonuses			1
as he was often the best paid employee at the bank , he said he was particularly keen to stop this happening and set up a @entity6 bank account to keep his pay secret			1
mr @entity10 added that he used the @entity27 structure purely to prevent colleagues in @entity6 finding how much he was being paid			1
the revelation comes after leaked documents from @entity61 in @entity6 ( pictured ) between 2005 and 2007 showed it had helped the rich and famous avoid millions in tax he said there was ‘ no tax advantage ’ and declared that he has paid full @entity47 tax on his earnings since moving from @entity44 to @entity67 with @entity1 in 2003			1
springing to his defence , the bank ’s chairman , @entity69 , said : ‘ there is absolutely no story here			0
there is nothing that @entity10 has done that is not absolutely transparent , legal and appropriate			2
’ seeking to justify his tax status , mr @entity10 said he had spent the majority of his 35 - year career at @entity1 in @entity44 and plans to return there when he steps down from the bank			1
businesses are expected to behave better than the armed forces and the church , @entity1 ’s chief executive complained yesterday			0
expressing his exasperation with regulators , @entity10 said : ‘ we seem now to be holding publicly listed companies to a different standard than we might hold the armed forces , the church or any large organisation			2
‘ it seems to be a notion that @entity69 [ @entity1 chairman @entity69 ] and i should know what every single one of our 257,000 staff is doing all day long			0
that is n’t normally how large organisations can run			0
’ @entity1 has been criticised as being ‘ too big to manage ’ after a series of scandals flared up on mr @entity10 ’s watch			2
it was fined £ 1.2billion by @entity105 regulators in 2012 after lax controls meant it became the ‘ bank of choice ’ for @entity109 drug cartels wanting to launder money			0
it was also fined £ 400million by @entity47 and @entity105 authorities last november for rigging the £ 3.5trillion a day foreign exchange market			0
@entity115 from broker @entity116 said : ‘ mr @entity10 may be right that companies are being held to higher standards			2
but to complain about it does sound a bit rich given the litany of misdemeanours at banks			0
they have brought it on themselves			0
’ ‘ i would expect to die abroad , ’ he added			0
but the comments received short shrift last night			0
@entity129 , a tax accountant , said he was ‘ astonished ’ that @entity131 has allowed mr @entity10 to remain domiciled in @entity44 despite the fact that he has lived in the @entity47 for the past 12 years			1
‘ being paid in a @entity6 bank account via a company is a classic case of tax avoidance , ’ he said			1
‘ but the big question is how on earth a man can leave the @entity47 at the age of 21 , come back 12 years ago and remain permanently domiciled in @entity44			2
i am astonished this has been accepted by the @entity131			0
‘ there are clearly advantages to this arrangement			0
among other things it allows mr @entity10 to avoid inheritance tax			1
’ although there is no suggestion that mr @entity10 has done anything illegal , the spotlight on his personal finances comes as @entity1 is under scrutiny over allegations that its private @entity6 bank helped clients evade taxes			1
yesterday mr @entity10 said the wrongdoing was a ‘ source of shame and reputational damage to @entity1 ’			2
despite this he received a £ 7.6million pay package last year , including a £ 1.3million bonus			0
this was a drop from his £ 8million package in 2013 – his bonus was cut by £ 500,000 to reflect other wrongdoing at the bank			0
@entity1 said its profits fell by 17 per cent last year to £ 12.2billion , while the bonus pool was cut from £ 2.6billion to £ 2.4billion .			0

@entity10 's bonuses allegedly paid via @entity27 - registered company
money put in @entity6 account until 2003 , leaked documents reportedly show
mr @entity10 said this was the only way to hide earnings from colleagues
claims without @entity27 business others in bank could search for earnings
he said : ' it was to enable *confidentiality* . there was no tax advantage '
@entity196 - born boss , 55 , is domiciled in @entity44 for legal and tax purposes
comes after it *emerged* that @entity6 @entity61 helped rich avoid millions in tax
