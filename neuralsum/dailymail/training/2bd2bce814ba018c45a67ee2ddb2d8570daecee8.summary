@entity0 insists @entity1 will look to push through their move for @entity3 this month , rather than wait until the summer			1
the @entity4 are in talks with @entity6 over a move for the @entity8 although he will face problems in obtaining a work permit given he has n't played international football			2
but as @entity23 revealed on wednesday , @entity1 will appeal any decision not to give @entity3 - who has a £ 15m buy - out clause - a permit this month in an attempt to land him now			1
and @entity0 confirmed : ' the talks are progressing quite well with @entity6 for @entity29			1
we are talking at the moment and slowly progressing			0
we are ready to pay the price for a good player			0
' we want the player and if he needs a work permit we will defend it now			0
' @entity0 confirmed that @entity36 , @entity1 's newest signing , will not play for at least three weeks @entity38 celebrates after scoring against @entity39 in a victory that @entity0 says gave his side belief the @entity4 travel to @entity42 in the @entity44 fourth round on saturday , but will be without forward @entity45 , who is not yet back in full training and will be missing for a further two weeks			1
@entity0 confirmed that @entity47 ( groin ) and @entity49 ( ankle ) are both uncertainties , while @entity52 is nearing a return to first - team action after resuming full training			1
@entity1 this week confirmed the signing of 17 - year - old @entity56 defensive midfielder @entity36 , but he will not play any part for at least three weeks			1
@entity58 ( bottom right ) marked @entity60 out of the game in @entity1 's 2 - 0 win at @entity39 at the end of last year @entity58 was on loan at @entity65 , with his @entity1 career seemingly over ' he ’s only just come from @entity56			2
he has just turned 17 , is not fit because they had a winter break in @entity56 and that is quite long , ' @entity0 admitted			2
' he ’s at the start of getting back to full fitness			0
he wo n’t be ready before three weeks			0
one player that is likely to play , and has done in every match since mid-december , is @entity58 , who @entity0 admitted has been offered a new deal at the @entity76			1
the midfielder ’s contract expires at the end of the season , but as revealed by @entity23 this week , talks over a new deal are now underway and the @entity4 are confident of securing the @entity83 to a long - term agreement in the coming weeks			2
@entity0 will give his midfield a shake - up ahead of next season and @entity58 will be part of a new - look engine room			1
for now though , @entity0 is fully focused on what he is sure will be a tough trip to @entity42 on sunday			1
' @entity92 will give them his experience and his competence of course , ' @entity0 continued			0
' he knows how to prepare a team for a challenge like that			0
for us the challenge is to turn up with the same spirit and show that we can be consistent with our attitude game by game			0
' in the @entity44 , god knows that is needed			0
we know that it will be another big challenge for us to go there and come home with a positive result			0
