by @entity0 published : 12:48 est , 29 december 2012 updated : 19:21 est , 29 december 2012 the @entity2 subway could be getting sliding doors on some platforms following another person 's fatal push onto the tracks			1
the @entity8 said yesterday that they are revisiting the possibility of installing sliding doors at some stations so it would only be possible to board the train when the screens are opened in - synch with the doors to the car			1
fifty - four people died on subway tracks this year alone , the @entity8 said			1
news of the development comes as schizophrenic @entity20 , who infamously shoved @entity21 onto the tracks in front of an oncoming train , said that there should be harsher regulations to prevent more senseless deaths			1
‘ should you let a mental patient like myself be in freedom so an incident like train - pushing can occur ? ’ he asked from the @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity2			2
‘ if you are a harm to anyone , even yourself , you should be hospitalized			0
’ @entity43 states that people in @entity56 who have certain mental illnesses must undergo regular psychiatric treatment			2
the law does not go as far as to force patients to take medications against their will			0
@entity20 , however , is now on medication and is lucid			1
in 2006 , he was sentenced to 23 years for shoving ms @entity21 into an oncoming n train at 23rd st. help : @entity20 , pictured in 1999 , confessed to shoving 32 - year - old @entity21 to her death under a @entity67 subway train ; he says there needs to be stricter laws the @entity42 notes that while @entity43 exists to protect the mentally ill from hurting themselves and others , it must be renewed every five years			1
in addition , there are certain loopholes allowing mentally ill @entity2 to remain out on the streets			0
horrific : @entity21 was pushed to her death under a subway train as it pulled into a midtown @entity67 station on january 3 , 1999 in light of the string of recent subway deaths , @entity8 executive director @entity79 said yesterday that ‘ we ’ll have to revisit ’ installing sliding doors in some subway stations			1
the development was exclusively reported by the @entity87			0
there have been talks of installing barriers throughout the years , but each time , the plans have been abandoned for one reason or another , the main reason being the overwhelming cost according to the @entity87 , it could cost as much as $ 1.5million to install sliding doors on each of the subway ’s 468 station platforms			1
neither the 7 line extension nor the @entity104 subway lines , which are both currently under construction , will get the new technology , an @entity8 official told the @entity87 , saying the construction was ‘ cost - prohibitive			1
’ mr @entity79 said in march that it was feasible , saying that hundred - year - old subway lines in @entity39 and @entity110 have been modified and modernized to meet safety concerns			2
that press conference came after 20 - year - old college student @entity113 was pushed onto the tracks by a homeless man			1
the technology already exists at @entity2 ’s @entity118 system , which transports people between terminals at @entity121			2
in addition , gates have been installed in many @entity125 and @entity126 cities to prevent these sorts of tragedies from happening			2

a photograph of him on the tracks a split second before he was killed was published on the front of the @entity42 the next day , causing an uproar and debate over whether the photographer , who had been waiting for a train , should have tried to help him and whether the newspaper should have run the image			1
