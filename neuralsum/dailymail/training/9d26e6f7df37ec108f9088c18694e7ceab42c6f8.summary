hotel chains and booking websites have been accused of working together to ‘ fix ’ prices for consumers looking for a discount			1
websites such as @entity7 and @entity8 have joined forces with hotel groups to protect their profit margins by ensuring the rates on ‘ discount ’ websites are actually the same as the normal price , an industry insider has said			1
@entity16 , ceo of discount hotel site @entity18 , has said he was forced out of the market after attempting to undercut his rivals by offering cheaper prices			1
@entity22 , which operates luxury hotels such as the @entity24 ( pictured ) is under investigation by the @entity26 mr @entity16 has even said he was threatened with violence by hotel owners angry at the possibility of their rooms being sold at rates cheaper than those agreed with the major booking portals			1
usually if hotels have spare rooms available , they sell the capacity on to estate agents and discount booking agencies , which then mark up their prices by about 25 % before offering them to the public			2
as well as earning the hotels more money overall , these high prices also protect the reputation of the hotels , and let them keep their prices high			1
but mr @entity16 says that when he decided to beat the competition by offering rooms on @entity18 at a smaller mark - up he lost 70 % of his business after hotel chains demanded he raise his prices to stay in step with the rest of the industry			1
he told @entity65 : ‘ we started getting some calls from angry and confused hoteliers insisting that we were selling their rooms too cheaply ... i realised a [ rival ] website had been on to them threatening all sorts of nonsense if they did n't either remove their hotel from @entity62 or force @entity62 to raise its prices			0
’ in a phone call recorded by @entity16 , a hotel manager in @entity74 whose hotels he had discounted told him : ‘ you 're gone			2
you will see what 's going to happen to you in one week			0
if you are in @entity74 then you will see what it means to be threatened			0
’ @entity7 is also under investigation for its practices around offering discount hotel rooms the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) opened an investigation into @entity7 and @entity8 in 2010 , looking at allegations they had colluded with @entity22 ( @entity22 ) , the world 's biggest provider of hotel rooms			1
it opened a public consultation on new industry proposals , which ended on friday			0
in them the three companies proposed a set of commitments , which would allow discount sites cut into their profit margin to offer cheaper rooms			0
however , the companies added that offering these commitments was not an admission of any past wrongdoing			0
anti-competitive business agreements , such as price - fixing , are illegal in the @entity101 , and in the most severe cases can result in an unlimited fine and up to five years in prison			0
legal action has also been launched in @entity106			0
papers filed in @entity108 claim that a @entity101 conference firm organised seminars where hoteliers would meet with discount site representatives to agree prices for their rooms			1
searches of discount websites for hotels in the @entity22 portfolio in @entity119 and @entity120 have shown that several discount websites offer the same prices as booking directly			2
another insider told @entity65 : ‘ most people know this is going on but the big firms are benefiting and the small operators are often too scared to speak up for fear of repercussions			0
’ the @entity26 said it could not comment while its investigation was going on			0
however , the watchdog has said in the past that it would like hotels and websites to be more transparent about the discounts they offer			0
it has not yet been determined whether @entity8 , @entity7 or @entity22 have broken the law			1
@entity8 declined to comment on the @entity26 probe			2
@entity22 said it had ‘ worked closely with the @entity26 ’ to agree commitments on how to operate in future			2
@entity7 said that it welcomes the draft commitments , and said it expects the @entity26 to close its investigation without taking any action			2
@entity22 declined to comment on mr @entity16 's allegations , but has said previously that it has ' worked closely with the @entity26 ' during the probe .			1

@entity16 , ceo of discount site @entity18 , said sites and hotels were working together
he claimed they prevent competition by keeping prices high
@entity26 launched investigation in 2010 and will report back soon
@entity8 , @entity7 and @entity22 hotel chain has offered to commit to new measures enabling greater discounts
