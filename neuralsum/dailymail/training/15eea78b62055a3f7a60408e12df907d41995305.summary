@entity0 face : @entity2 campaigned against cuts before taking a £ 75,000 - a - year job with the firm used by the government to reform disability benefits a leading campaigner against welfare cuts who claimed to be too sick to work has taken a £ 75,000 - a - year job with the firm used by the government to reform disability benefits			1
@entity2 , a darling of the @entity16 who has railed against @entity19 ’s reforms for the last five years , has been recruited by @entity20 , the @entity21 company that has taken over a controversial ‘ fitness for work ’ test for benefit claimants			1
her extraordinary volte face has shocked and infuriated supporters , who have branded her a ‘ @entity29 ’ and a ‘ sell - out ’			1
mrs @entity2 said she had undergone an ‘ enormous - almost cosmic - mindset shift ’ that had led her to accept a job as the company ’s new ‘ head of customer experience ’			1
she had previously claimed that in @entity37 , the @entity36 had sought out the ‘ worst provider they could find ’ to assess claimants of disability benefits			2
mr @entity19 , the @entity42 , welcomed mrs @entity2 ’s decision to jump ship and take a lucrative position with the firm			1
‘ i would be the first person to congratulate anyone who gets a job			2
i 'm sure there will be some whose negative attitudes to our reforms mean they will criticise her move			0
they should be ignored , ’ the minister told the @entity48 last night			0
mrs @entity2 ran a blog which she called the ‘ @entity59 ’ , detailing her own efforts to be declared unfit for work because of @entity63 ’s disease , an inflammatory bowel condition			1
she was eventually placed into the ‘ support group ’ for employment and support allowance , the main sickness benefit , which is for people judged e unable to work or even to attend interviews			1
she was an architect of the @entity72 campaign , which produced a series of reports accusing the government of cruelty and incompetence in its efforts to cut the welfare bill and was championed on @entity80 by supporters including @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			2
mrs @entity2 appeared at the @entity87 ’s annual conference in 2013 and wrote regularly for the @entity88			2
announcing her new job , she admitted she had ‘ agonised ’ about how to tell her supporters of her decision			1
late last year , @entity20 was awarded a three - and - a - half year contract to take over delivery of the ‘ work capability assessment ’ – the test of claimants ’ ability to work -- from the much - criticised @entity98			1
mrs @entity2 insisted said she was motivated only by a desire to improve the system			2
‘ those who doubt my intentions and goals and those with different goals to mine will almost certainly be critical , and , in a sense , i understand that response			0
if i did n't know me i might be sceptical too , ’ she added			0
mrs @entity2 said her own , successful application to be declared eligible for sickness benefits had been ‘ threatening and scary ’			1
but she insisted : ‘ it is not inherently a good thing for support group numbers to be high			0
if some of those people who qualify would actually rather like to work , but are terrified of an intimidating and farcical system of support , that actually leads to a life of fear of change , ’ she said			2
‘ we are coming up to an election period			0
there will be a hiatus and a time to breathe and take stock			0
there is a new provider , @entity20 … if there was ever a time to get significant and valuable changes to what now seems universally accepted to be a system that is in serious need of better delivery , it is now			0
’ fans : mrs @entity2 was championed on @entity80 by supporters including @entity83 ( @entity137 ) and @entity84 she said @entity138 had given her ‘ fairly free rein to devise a strategy to bring about a wide range of improvements to the service from a customer perspective ’			1
‘ of course there are considerable benefits to both myself and @entity20 in this development			0
i will be giving the same 300 per cent passion and commitment to them that i have been giving to campaigning			0
‘ crucially , it 's a campaigner 's job to change things , not just to make a lot of noise			2
whilst i have to make an enormous - almost cosmic - mindset shift to take this direction , @entity20 also have to bring me into their trust and with very little to go on			1
‘ someone is going to do it			0
i can do it , with all of my knowledge and personal experience of what is wrong with the system at the moment			0
’ one correspondent on mrs @entity2 ’s website wrote : ‘ i am so sorry to say this but i feel betrayed so much i can only now call you @entity29			1
’ @entity2 is a darling of the @entity16 who railed against @entity19 ’s ( above ) reforms for the last five years another former supporter , @entity175 , said : ‘ sorry , i have to add my name to the list sickened by this decision			1
so sickened in fact i do n't even want to try to explain why i find this a betrayal of the trust so many of us placed in you in recent years , @entity2			2
’ @entity184 branded @entity185 a ‘ sell - out , just like all the @entity187 who go on to work for the multinationals ’			1
‘ so what happened to " i 'm in so much pain i ca n't work , please give me @entity189 [ @entity189 ] ” ? i ca n't wait to see how much of a hypocrite you turn out to be			0
and be aware you have just marked yourself for a life of hate from people who really are true victims of this and future governments , ’ he added			0
another activist wrote : ‘ you 've proudly displayed photos of yourself bed and hospital bound , yet it seems an offer of [ reportedly ] £ 75k per annum plus benefits has healed you			0
you 've gone straight from the support group to full time employment - you truly are a modern day miracle			0
@entity19 's prayers have been answered			0
