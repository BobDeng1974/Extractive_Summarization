after receiving a call from a gay man who said he suffered homophobic abuse on a train in @entity5 , two radio presenters decided to conduct an experiment			1
@entity8 @entity7 and @entity9 walked through the town to gauge the public reaction to an openly gay couple			1
a 23 - year - old called @entity13 had told them he was used to being insulted by strangers when he and his boyfriend held hands			0
in the video , the men walk down a street and as they pass a group of men , each one turns to stare at the supposedly gay couple			1
mr @entity9 says : ' we 've walked about three or four minutes and we 've had looks , we 've definitely had looks			2
' and mr @entity7 says : ' i saw a dad usher a child away from us , did you see that ? ' yeah , there was a dad walking with his kid , he clocked the hands , clocked us , and then said , ' come on , love			2
' mr @entity9 says : ' we 've walked about three or four minutes and we 've had looks , we 've definitely had looks ' as they pass a group of men in hi - vis vests , each one turns to stare at the supposedly gay couple but then they approach a teenager after overhearing him say ' urgh ' after noticing their entwined hands			1
they approach the boy and ask him to elaborate on his comment and are told : ' i thought it was disgusting			2
' asked why , he repeats : ' because it 's disgusting			1
' a woman , who was with him at the time , says : ' he does n't obviously agree with homosexuality			0
he 's got a stigma			0
he 's a teenage boy			1
' and when asked for her own views , she says : ' i 'm not against it , but i do n't like it in my face to be honest			0
' it does make me feel a little bit embarrassed if you two were to embrace in a kiss , i would feel a little bit awkward but that 's about as far as it would go			0
' she adds she is not ' narrow - minded ' but says : ' especially in @entity5 you do n't see that			0
you would n't see that			0
' and the boy then repeats : ' i just think it 's wrong for two men , i think it 's disgusting in my opinion			1
' at the end of the experiment , mr @entity7 concludes : ' it certainly felt uncomfortable			2
whereas i know if you 'd been a girl and i was holding your hand , there would have been nothing			0
he adds : ' i 'm surprised and disappointed			0
' they approach a teenager : ' i just think it 's wrong for two men , i think it 's disgusting '			1
