calls for a re-think of @entity3 ’s controversial commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid have received a substantial boost			1
the influential @entity8 newspaper says the @entity3 should focus on the quality of projects rather than how much money is spent			1
it said at the weekend that at a time of intense pressure on public finances , it was right to question @entity17 ’s ‘ rigid ’ target – an argument made repeatedly by the @entity19			1
the @entity8 ’s stance follows the revelation last week that @entity3 will spend £ 1billion more on foreign aid than expected over the next two years following upward revisions to @entity3 growth			1
it will give a boost to many @entity40 backbenchers , who are unhappy that the aid budget has been ring - fenced at a time when other elements of public spending are being hugely pared back			1
this year , £ 11.5billion was spent by the @entity45 on overseas aid – meeting the 0.7 per cent target			2

this is a far larger sum than is disbursed by any other @entity85 state			0
‘ among the world ’s big nations , only the @entity86 spends more			0
it is hugely to the credit of @entity17 ’s government , and his @entity93 predecessors , that @entity3 maintains a noble aspiration to assist the world ’s poor			0
@entity96 ( pictured ) , @entity40 mp for @entity97 , claimed ‘ the @entity8 are spot on ' ‘ but at a time of intense pressure on public finances , it is reasonable to question the rigidity of the @entity3 ’s commitment to international development spending			1
’ the paper pointed out the target was set 50 years ago by the @entity108			2
