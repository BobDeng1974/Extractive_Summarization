by @entity0 earlier this week , controversial @entity2 creative director @entity1 caused outrage after telling an interviewer that ' no one wants to see curvy women on the catwalk '			2
now artist @entity8 has given the @entity11 designer a taste of his own medicine by creating a series of cartoons that portray him as grossly overweight			1
and @entity1 is n't alone			2
also in line for the @entity19 treatment were @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 among others			1
heavyweight : @entity2 's @entity1 probably wo n't enjoy seeing himself portrayed as an obese fast food fan fat and fashionable : @entity21 and @entity22 ( right ) get the @entity29 treatment the @entity31 images show the designer bulging out of his trademark monochrome suit and ensconced in an armchair guzzling fast food			1
@entity36 is pictured spilling out of a tight red dress while an unusually dishevelled @entity22 sits eating burgers in a crumpled suit			1
@entity19 is famous for his controversial cartoons and is no stranger to portraying the likes of @entity20 and @entity1 in unusual situations , having previously authored a series that showed @entity20 performing scenes from the @entity47 with @entity48			1
this time , says @entity50 , the aim is to highlight the issue of fat in fashion - a subject that he believes is ignored			1
' the topic of [ being ] oversize is still a taboo in the fashion business , ' explained @entity50			1
' with this series , i wanted to do a true tribute to the concept			1
' @entity50 , who also revealed that his favourite fashion icon is @entity20 , added : ' i think that fashion is chasing obsolete ideals more than suggesting impossible ones			1
not so glamorous : @entity68 editor @entity20 looks a far cry from her usual gamine self in these cartoons @entity72 ! @entity73 is given a few extra pounds @entity74 : @entity76 's @entity75 gets a fat - over courtesy of @entity19 making his marc : designer @entity79 with a lot of extra weight body conscious : both @entity36 and @entity83 are know for their dedication to looking good ' we are living [ through ] big changes but i feel that fashion is living in the past - the 80s are long gone			1
' fashion magazines are becoming less interesting but they continue to offer sad and boring women as an ideal - they are obviously the mirror of the editors more than their readers			1
' despite his love of lampooning fashion 's great and good , @entity19 boasts a very stylish cv of his own			1
previously a knitwear designer , he showed his collections at @entity104 , before turning his attention to satire via his blog @entity108			1
he describes the blog as a daily society portrait : ' the best illustrated fashion chronicle , a point of view about costume , politics , culture , society and celebrity , ' and describes himself as ' the father of @entity120 , visionary artist , author and critic			1
' earlier this week , it was revealed that the @entity2 supremo was facing legal action after telling an interviewer that ' no one wants to see curvy girls on the catwalk '			2
although this is the first time the designer has faced court action because of his bons mots , he 's not known for pulling his verbal punches			1
here are some of the other injured parties : @entity138 : ' if i was a woman in @entity138 i would be a lesbian , as the men are very ugly			2
there are a few handsome ones , like @entity144 's boyfriend , but there you see the most beautiful women and the most horrible men			2
' @entity149 : ' @entity149 needs to work on a cleaner image			1
it 's a big problem , as they have this reputation of being so corrupt			2
you ca n't be sure the money will go where it 's supposed to go , ' he concluded			2
' nobody wants @entity149 to disappear , but they have really disgusting habits			2
' the facially challenged : ' life is not a beauty contest , some [ ugly people ] are great			0
what i hate is nasty , ugly people			0
the worst is ugly short men			0
women can be short , but for men it is impossible			0
it is something that they will not forgive in life - they are mean and they want to kill you			0
' the politically correct : ' be politically correct , but please do n't bother other people with conversation about being politically correct , because that 's the end of everything			0
you want to create boredom ? be politically correct in your conversation			0
' @entity185 : ' @entity184 has a nice silhouette			0
i like that kind of woman , i like romantic beauties			0
on the other hand , the sister struggles			0
i do n't like the sister 's face			0
she should only show her back			0
' @entity196 : ' the thing at the moment is @entity196			0
she is a little too fat , but she has a beautiful face and a divine voice			0
' @entity201 : ' is she a construct with all her implants ? ' @entity204 : ' i do n't know @entity204			0
she was never known in @entity206			0
@entity207 also does n't know who she is			0
