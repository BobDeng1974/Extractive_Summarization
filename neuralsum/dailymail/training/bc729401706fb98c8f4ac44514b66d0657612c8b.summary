unable to live with the guilt , a week after @entity9 ’s death in april last year he tried to commit suicide by jumping off a flyover			2
he survived despite suffering several broken bones and needing brain surgery			0
he and miss @entity50 may now face charges of manslaughter on the grounds of gross negligence after coroner dr @entity56 ordered a transcript of evidence heard at the inquest to be sent to the @entity60			1
dr @entity56 said : ‘ it is with an extremely heavy heart that i apply my duty to adjourn these proceedings because in my view it is likely that a charge of gross negligence manslaughter could be brought against mr @entity14 and miss @entity50			2
‘ the evidence , which i have reflected on , heard yesterday [ wednesday ] , is different to the evidence that the @entity60 initially considered			1
’ she went on to highlight five issues of concern			0
‘ we heard yesterday that the drugs were readily accessible , that @entity76 and mr @entity14 already knew teenagers at parties in their house could behave as teenagers do , ’ she said			1
‘ they knew that even when they were present , teenagers got drunk , they knew that previously their cannabis stash in their home had been found and i have concerns that supervision of the party was inadequate at best			1

they had asked family friend @entity94 , who lived opposite them , to be on standby in case anything happened			0
untimely death : flowers and candles were left in tribute to the schoolgirl who started foaming at the mouth mourning : friends and family @entity104 released balloons in memory of the schoolgirl @entity109 , representing @entity9 ’s family , said ‘ they had very serious concerns about the issues that had been raised ’			2
dr @entity56 is also trying to establish if @entity115 could have been saved if an ambulance had been called earlier after she suffered a shaking fit and was foaming at the mouth			0

mr @entity14 , who was a research fellow at the @entity137 ’s @entity136 , had been due to give evidence yesterday but never got the chance			2
a @entity60 spokesman said : ‘ if the coroner sends something to us we will look at it			2
