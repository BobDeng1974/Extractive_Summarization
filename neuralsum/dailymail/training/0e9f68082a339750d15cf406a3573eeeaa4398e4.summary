the @entity0 have been plunged into a race row over the fact that all the nominees in the four acting categories are white			1
@entity6 civil rights activist @entity5 said yesterday : ‘ the movie industry is like the @entity8 – the higher you get , the whiter it gets			1
’ @entity5 , 60 , a critic of the lack of diversity in the @entity6 movie industry , added : ‘ i have called an emergency meeting early next week in @entity14 … to discuss possible action around the @entity0			1
@entity30 ’s director , @entity26 , had been tipped to be the first black woman ever nominated for best director , after she was shortlisted for last weekend ’s @entity39			1
but she , too , was locked out of @entity0 contention in another all - white category			2
@entity5 said : ‘ the lack of diversity in the @entity0 nominations is appalling and while it is good that @entity30 was nominated for best picture , it ’s ironic that they nominated a story about the racial shut - out around voting while there is a racial shut - out around the @entity0 nominations			1
‘ with all of the talent in @entity30 and other black movies this year , it is hard to believe that we have less diversity in the nominations today than in recent history			2
’ the lack of ethnic variety prompted campaigners to take to social networking site @entity64 and create the online trend # @entity66			0
@entity68 nomination : @entity70 received nine nods in total , one for @entity68 , it was announced on thursday morning by the @entity73 on the list : the @entity75 , starring @entity76 , also got a nod @entity30 , starring @entity78 , @entity23 , @entity79 and @entity80 , was produced by @entity82 's @entity81 and @entity83 the 2011 @entity0 also featured an exclusively white crop of 20 acting nominees , the first time that had happened since 1998			1
but award watchers claim this is ‘ the whitest @entity0 ’ in years and a reminder of the slow pace of change in @entity14 , even after what looked like progress for black actors and filmmakers last year stemming from the best picture winner , 12 years a slave			2
all 20 actors nominated in the four acting categories this year are white and no women are nominated for either best director or screenwriter			1
the @entity73 has some 6,000 members			0
@entity105 , founder of awards tracker @entity106 , said : ‘ @entity108 is about 90 per cent white and 70 per cent male and we ’re seeing the sad result of that in voting			0

@entity23 and director @entity26 should have been nominated

@entity258 's @entity115 lands six nominations
@entity307 's @entity306 and @entity308 star @entity305 both *snubbed*
@entity311 's @entity310 *overlooked* and @entity191 left out of best *animated* feature film category
