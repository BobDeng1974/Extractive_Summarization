the hunt for missing @entity1 has been narrowed to the southern region of the previous search zone after a new analysis of satellite phone data			1
a failed attempt at a satellite phone call from the jet ' suggests ... the aircraft might have turned south a little earlier than expected , ' said @entity10 , @entity11 's deputy prime minister			1
it comes just weeks before the multi-million dollar , year - long sonar hunt for wreckage is due to begin			1
the overall search area still remained unchanged , mr @entity10 said			1
he did not explain how the southern area was singled out			2
the jet vanished without a trace after flying off course while ferrying passengers from @entity23 to @entity24 however , @entity26 chief commissioner @entity25 said he would meet with international experts next week to decide whether the 60,000 square kilometre ( 23,000 square mile ) targeted search area should be extended or shifted further south based on the new analysis			1
' we think we may extend that area farther south ; that 's the thing we 're currently considering , ' he said			0
the new analysis applies to satellite data from the first of two satellite phone calls @entity37 ground staff attempted to make to flight 370 's crew			0
by the time the calls were attempted , the plane had become invisible to civilian radar			0
it had flown west without communications past @entity45 and beyond the range of @entity48 military radar			2
mr @entity25 said the new analysis suggested the jet was already flying south when the first phone call was attempted less than 20 minutes after the plane dropped off military radar			0
' previously , there was the possibility that it could have been quite a bit later , so we had to do our modelling based on a range of possibilities as to where the aircraft turned , ' he said			0
@entity48 transport minister @entity61 and @entity11 deputy prime minister @entity10 today signed a memorandum of understanding sharing the ongoing costs of the search for the missing @entity18 a @entity66 submersible aboard an @entity11 vessel			1
similar submarine vehicles equipped with sonar , echo sounders and video cameras will be used to scour 23,000 square miles of search area ' we 're now more confident that it turned comparatively early			1
that does make a difference to how we prioritise the search along the seventh arc , ' he added , referring to the area where satellite information from a jet engine transmitter suggests the plane ran out of fuel and crashed			2
investigators have long been aware of the phone call			0
but they have only recently adapted analysis methodology to glean clues to the plane 's direction from the satellite phone data			0
@entity1 disappeared on march 8 after flying far off course from @entity23 to @entity24			0
officials say the investigation into the how it crashed can only proceed once its wreckage and black boxes are recovered			1
by the time the calls were attempted , the plane had become invisible to civilian radar			0
it had flown west without communications past @entity45 and beyond the range of @entity48 military radar			2
mr @entity25 said the new analysis suggested the jet was already flying south when the first phone call was attempted less than 20 minutes after the plane dropped off military radar			0
today , mr @entity10 and @entity61 , @entity48 's transport minister , signed a memorandum of understanding sharing the ongoing costs of the search for the missing @entity18 as it progresses to an expensive new stage			1
mr @entity61 said investigators had advised that success of the undersea search for wreckage and the aircraft 's back boxes with cockpit voice recordings and flight data was crucial to solving the mystery of the disaster			2
' the investigation can not continue without the search result , ' he said			2
' we need to find the plane , we need to find the black box in the plane so that we can have a conclusion in the investigation			0
' @entity48 , as the country where the @entity18 was flagged , has overall responsibility for the investigation			1
but @entity11 has search and rescue responsibility for the area of the @entity135 where the plane is thought to have crashed 1,100 miles off @entity11 's west coast			1
from next month three vessels towing underwater vehicles equipped with side - scan sonar , multi-beam echo sounders and video equipment will begin scouring 23,000 square miles of search area			1
the operation could take up to a year and cost au $ 52million ( Â£ 29m )			0
before the underwater search starts , two survey ships are mapping the entire search area			1
@entity149 vice minister of transport @entity150 , who also attended the @entity153 meeting , said the ministers agreed that the search would not be interrupted or given up			0
most of the lost passengers , 153 , were @entity149 .			0

the overall search area in the southern @entity135 remains unchanged
officials from @entity11 and @entity48 agree to share costs of search
investigation into the crash can only begin once the wreckage is found
