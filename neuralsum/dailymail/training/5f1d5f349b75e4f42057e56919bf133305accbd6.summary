by @entity0 published : 05:14 est , 7 september 2013 updated : 06:05 est , 7 september 2013 new powers to test doctors ' language skills could be introduced after a survey showed that patients ' lives were being put at risk			1
an alarming 66 cases were investigated by senior @entity10 staff in 2011 after patients complained that they had received poor treatment from doctors who had a poor grasp of the @entity16 language			1
in an attempt to tackle the problem , the government has proposed introducing language tests specifically for doctors arriving from @entity23 countries in what would amount to a change to @entity23 law			1
@entity27 : the government is seeking for a change to @entity23 law to allow the @entity30 to test language skills of doctors although the @entity30 can test the @entity16 of doctors from non @entity23 countries , it has been banned from testing the skills of those arriving from member states since 1983			1
more than 25,000 doctors from the @entity23 are registered to practice in the @entity40 , none of whom have ever been tested for their @entity16 skills			2
health minister dr @entity44 said : ' overseas doctors make a hugely valuable contribution to the @entity10 but it is clear that tougher checks are needed			0
' we have already strengthened the way doctors ' language skills are checked at a local level			0
important step : health minister @entity44 said the change would prevent doctors with limited @entity16 from practicing in the @entity40 ' these new powers are an important step in making the system even stronger by allowing the @entity30 to carry out checks on a national level before they start work in the @entity40 and prevent doctors who do not have the necessary knowledge of @entity16 from treating patients			1
' roughly half of the 500 senior doctors responsible for investigating complaints took part in a poll , which revealed the scale of the language problem			1
in 2008 @entity73 dr @entity72 killed @entity75 patient @entity74 when he confused two drugs and gave him 10 times the recommended dose of diamorphine			1
under the government 's plans , the @entity30 would not be given the right to automatically test all @entity23 doctors , but it would be able to carry out tests if concerns were raised when they registered to work			2
inspectors could be given the right to check competency when looking at qualifications , how long doctors have been registered in other countries and what experience they have			0
red flags might include doctors turning up with interpreters , poor @entity16 in interviews or poor written @entity16 on application forms			0
any worries could then prompt full testing of the doctor 's language skills			0
the new plans would also allow the @entity30 to assess any doctor if language concerns arise during a fitness - to - practise investigation			0
at present , the @entity30 has no powers to carry out such checks during its hearings			0
lethal dose : dr @entity72 killed a patient after confusing two different drugs chief executive of the @entity30 @entity115 said : ' we are delighted that the government is consulting on changes to the @entity119 to give us new powers to check the @entity16 language skills of all doctors when we have concerns about them			1
' this is an important move that will help protect patients and will be welcomed across the country			1
' a spokesman for the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) said : ' it is vital for clinical safety that doctors working in the @entity40 have the appropriate @entity16 language skills to communicate effectively with colleagues and their patients			2
' the @entity130 believes that it is right that we consider enhancing the @entity30 's powers to ensure doctors working in the @entity40 can speak @entity16 well enough before they treat patients			2
' at a local level , staff called responsible officers - appointed senior doctors - already have a legal duty to make sure doctors can speak @entity16 to perform their role			2
since april , there has also been one , single national list which every gp has to be on before they can treat @entity10 patients			0
the new changes are expected to come into force next year			0
a 12 - week consultation on the proposals will run until december 2			0

senior doctors investigated 66 complaints from patients of poor language
@entity30 could once again test @entity16 in change to @entity23 law
' this is an important move that will help protect patients , ' says @entity30
in 2008 a patient died when @entity73 doctor @entity72 confused drugs
