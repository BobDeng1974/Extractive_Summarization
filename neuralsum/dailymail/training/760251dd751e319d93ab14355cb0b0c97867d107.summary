by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 leader @entity2 embarked on a final round of media interviews ahead of local and @entity7 elections tomorrow @entity2 today claimed he would ‘ do a deal with the devil ’ if it meant securing a referendum on @entity10 leaving the @entity11			1
the @entity3 leader said he would back a @entity16 or conservative minority government if he gets mps in the @entity18 next year to ensure the public get a say on the @entity11			1
he also revealed plans to tackle the perception that his party is like a ‘ one - man band ’ , and conceded that the pressure of the @entity27 election campaign had meant ‘ sometimes a few cracks begin to show ’			1
polls suggest @entity3 will win the @entity31 elections , pushing @entity16 into second place and the @entity33 in third			1
local elections are also being held in @entity34 , with 4,216 seats and 161 councils at stake			0
mr @entity2 is increasingly confident that @entity3 will win tomorrow ’s @entity31 elections when results are announced on sunday night			2
he wants to use a victory over @entity16 and the @entity33 as a springboard to securing seats in the @entity18 , claiming @entity3 could even hold the balance of power in the event of a hung @entity31			1
mr @entity2 acknowledged it was ‘ moonshine ’ to suggest that @entity3 , which has no mps , could win the 2015 election , but the party would target winnable seats in an effort to hold the balance of power			1
he told @entity56 ’s today programme : ‘ i would do a deal , post the next election , i would help a minority party in @entity53 , i would do a deal with the devil in those circumstances if it got us a referendum			0
’ he claimed that @entity16 leader @entity64 would be forced to match the @entity66 pledge of an in - out referendum if his party does badly in this week ’s elections			1
@entity69 has promised a public vote on membership of the @entity11 by the end of 2017 , but mr @entity2 was sceptical about the pledge			0
asked if he was saying the prime minister was dishonourable , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i 'll pass on that			0
when you ’re out in front and everybody ’s firing every missile they ’ve got at you , yeah , sometimes a few cracks begin to show			1
on being a one - man band : ‘ i think in terms of the @entity7 election campaign , i have been very much the dominant figure in the campaign , yes , i accept that and i do n’t think in terms of this election that ’s necessarily been a handicap			0
i ’m going to appoint , over the course of the summer , spokesmen who will take on responsibilities for specific areas and they ’re the people that i ’m going to push forward because i do n’t think people will vote for us in a general election in big numbers if they think it ’s a one - man band			1
’ on the general election : ‘ what we will do is pursue , for 2015 , a strategy not to win the general election – that would be entirely ridiculous , moonshine			1
but what we will do is to do what @entity121 did so brilliantly with the @entity123 in the 1990s and that is to target our resources and to target our best people to get a good number of @entity127 elected in 2015 and who knows , we may get the balance of power if we get that right , and if we do there will be a referendum , whoever ’s in government			2
’ one getting an in - out referendum : ‘ ‘ i would do a deal , post the next election , i would help a minority party in @entity53 , i would do a deal with the devil in those circumstances if it got us a referendum			0
’ on talks between @entity3 and the @entity33 : ‘ they do n’t talk to people like me			1
there are no lines of communication open between @entity66 high command and @entity3			0
we are considered to be the lower orders ’ on his epitaph : ‘ i hope what it will say is : he led a party to win a national election on 22 may 2014 which led on to a referendum and our country getting back its democracy			1
’ he said ' one or two ' @entity66 mps were interested in running as joint @entity66 - @entity3 candidates in 2015 and he was ' open to having those conversations ' , but predicted they would be vetoed by mr @entity69			1
some polls put @entity3 ahead in the @entity27 elections , while others suggest @entity16 are in the lead			1
mr @entity2 insisted that @entity3 had run a more professional campaign than in the past but he admitted that not everything had gone according to plan			0
a ‘ carnival ’ staged in @entity173 yesterday to prove @entity3 is not racist had to be abandoned after a steel band refused to play and protesters drowned out candidates ’ speeches			2
@entity3 strategists hoped it would be a ' bold and vibrant ' event to defy their critics , but organisers were confronted with protesters likening the party to @entity185			2
mr @entity2 tore up plans to attend after opponents clashed with party members , the steel band walked out and a @entity3 candidate branded @entity173 a ' dump '			2
today mr @entity2 admitted that ' we all make mistakes in life and things do n't always go according to plan ' and , because the party had been leading the polls ahead of tomorrow 's elections , it had come under sustained pressure and ' sometimes a few cracks begin to show '			1
but he insisted the party 's popularity would continue beyond the @entity7 elections , and promised that a ' higher calibre ' of @entity3 politicians would help the party act less like a ' one - man band ' in future			2
' there are now people who do n't just lend their votes to @entity3 for @entity7 elections , they are actually @entity3 voters , ' he said			0
' what i 'm going to do over the course of the summer , and remember we are going to have a whole new load of meps elected , they will be a much higher calibre than anything we 've ever had before			0
' i am going to appoint , over the course of the summer , spokesmen to take on responsibilities for specific areas and they are the people i 'm going to push forward			0
' i do n't think people will vote for us in a general election in numbers if they think it 's a one - man band			1
i intend to change that over the summer			0
' the comments will be seen as an admission that the party ’s success can not depend on his own personal appeal alone			0
a @entity3 ' carnival ' staged in @entity173 yesterday to prove the party is not racist had to be abandoned after protesters clashed with party members @entity2 once claimed he had different views on women to other men - because he had ' got so many pregnant '			1
the @entity3 leader , who has four children from two marriages , told an obscure @entity250 magazine that he did not think women should fight on the front line in the army			1
he said he might disagree with other men on this question because of his experience with women			0
the bizarre comments , to @entity261 's ' @entity260 ' magazine , came after the last general election in 2010			1
he was asked if women should play football , but he said there was ' a bigger question ' of whether they should be allowed into the army			0
the @entity3 leader said : ' do we think , chaps , when we 're there in the front line , when the balloon goes up , with fixed bayonets , when the whistle 's about to blow to go over the top , do we actually want to be there with women beside us ? ' a barman , working near to where the interview was taking place , shouted out : ' yes ! ' mr @entity2 responded : ' do we ? what an extraordinarily bizarre idea ! i certainly do n't think so			1
but maybe it 's because i 've got so many women pregnant over the years that i have a different view			0
critics of mr @entity2 ’s leadership style have claimed he prefers to dominate the limelight			0
but the pressures of a general election campaign mean he will need a bigger team around him			1
mr @entity2 insisted that he has had no talks with the @entity33 directly , adding : ' they do n’t talk to people like me			0
there are no lines of communication open between @entity66 high command and @entity3			0
we are considered to be the lower orders			0
' but he hinted that local deals could be done with @entity308 @entity66 mps which would see them run on a joint ticket with @entity3			2
' i think that if there is a sitting conservative – as i say , it could be @entity16 too – but if there is a sitting conservative mp who genuinely wants this country to be independent , free , self - governing and they go along to a local @entity3 association and say they want to do a deal on that basis and run on a joint ticket , we would be open to that idea			1
' however , @entity16 seized on the comments as proof that a vote for @entity3 was actually a vote for the conservatives			2
shadow cabinet office minister @entity329 said : ' @entity2 has let the cat out of the bag : a vote for @entity3 is a vote for the @entity33			2
' @entity3 's policies are more @entity66 than the @entity33			2
we know @entity69 cut taxes for millionaires - but @entity3 want even bigger tax cuts for millionaires			0
we know it 's harder to see your gp under @entity69 , but @entity3 think the answer is to charge people to see their gp			0
' whether it 's deeper cuts to public services or scrapping workers ' rights , we have confirmation that @entity2 is actively considering shabby political deals with the conservatives right across the country , only days after he said he 'd do a deal to keep @entity69 in @entity354			0
' the message is clear : vote @entity3 and you do n't only get policies more extreme than the @entity33 , you also get @entity69			2

@entity3 leader says he would be prepared to back @entity16 or @entity33 in *coalition*
says it is ' moonshine ' to think @entity3 could win the 2015 general election
but claims he could win enough mps to hold the balance of power
after *anti-racist* ' carnival ' was cancelled , admits to feeling the pressure
says since the party took a poll lead ' sometimes a few cracks begin to show '
