she 's famous for her conservative sense of style but that did n't stop the @entity4 from plumping for an unusually bright hue for her first day on @entity7 soil			1
paying tribute to her @entity7 hosts , the @entity9 ' sunny £ 900 dress mirrored the gold of the @entity7 flag and was created by the @entity16 - based @entity15 designer , @entity14			1
but while the dress drew appreciative gasps from the waiting crowd , it seems not everyone was a fan of the bold ensemble			2
' @entity23 said i look like a banana , ' @entity4 confided to one well - wisher , @entity26 , as the couple arrived at @entity29 's iconic @entity28			1
and it also proved a hit with well wishers , among them mrs @entity26 , who enjoyed a friendly conversation with the @entity4 from her perch in the disabled section , and another with the @entity9			2
she told @entity23 that she had seen him as a baby in @entity56 when he took his first few steps at @entity58 , @entity59			2
and she told him that she clearly remembered his mother and that she looked more beautiful in real life than in her photographs , to which the @entity9 replied : ' thank you very much			0
' as 32 - year - old @entity4 first stepped off the plane in @entity29 , she carried @entity38 - the real star of the show - in her arms as the family made their way out of the aircraft to meet a line of waiting dignitaries , including the prime minister @entity75			1
wake up : @entity4 peers down at a sleepy @entity38 as she steps off the plane in her @entity14 dress stunning : @entity4 admired her posy of flowers which were presented by @entity81 , 22 , who has @entity82 , as she walked alongside the @entity9 and a squirming and grumpy looking @entity38 standing among the soberly - dressed dignitaries , her yellow dress provided a welcome splash of colour - unsurprising as , according to @entity88 , a retailer that stocks the dress , it was inspired by the work of @entity92 artist @entity91 and incorporates his trademark bold block colours			1
while you can pick up the dress off the peg , it comes in white with flashes of yellow - the reverse of the @entity4 ' dress - which indicates that the piece was made specifically for the visit			0
but with its square neckline and neatly tailored shape , the piece is a classic that retailers such as the duchess of @entity34 's favourite high street name @entity111 have found easy to emulate			0
it is not the first time the @entity4 has worn yellow to a public occasion either			0
she previously wore a dustier shade of the colour for her arrival at @entity119 in july 2011 as part of the royal couple 's @entity122 tour			0
glowing mum : the 32 - year - old stood out from the crowd as she introduced @entity38 to @entity129 , centre right , the wife of @entity7 's governor - general @entity126 , far right careful : @entity23 passes baby @entity131 back to his mother as her glossy hair is blown back in the wind during that visit , she paired her dress with shiny nude heels and repeated the trick for @entity29			1
the family touched down in the city for their long - awaited trip at 2.25pm , with the doors to their plane opening at 2.35pm sharp , for their 10 day tour of @entity7 , the second leg of their three - week tour @entity150			2
amongst the highlights of the trip are a visit to @entity155 - watching life savers on @entity156 and a visit to the world famous @entity158 with @entity131 , where a @entity160 is being named after the little prince			0
the wife of the second - in - line to the @entity165 throne and mother of a future king , has looked immaculate throughout the royal tour of @entity56			0
on this showing , it seems her tour of @entity7 will prove just as stylish			0
not in the mood ? @entity4 encourages her son to get in the meet and greet mood but he looks far from interested just the two of us : the @entity9 and @entity4 walk down the stairs of the @entity178 , while @entity131 is taken to the car by his nanny joking around : the royal pair hold cricket bats presented to them in front of the @entity184 during a reception at the @entity178 performance : the pair watch an @entity189 welcome performance during the reception at the @entity28 before moving onto @entity191 where they were reunited with @entity38 @entity131 waited with his nanny while the @entity9 and @entity4 posed with the governor - general sir @entity126 and @entity193 at @entity191 smiles all around : @entity38 looks delighted after he received a giant stuffed wombat gift from the governor - general sir @entity126 at @entity191 , @entity29 , during the tenth day of their official tour to @entity56 and @entity7 @entity4 wore a dustier shade of the colour for her arrival at @entity119 in july 2011 as part of the royal couple 's @entity122 tour a colourful array : @entity4 wears a red @entity205 coat dress , left , a black and white dress by @entity208 designer @entity207 , second left , followed by a blue bespoke version of an @entity211 utility coat dress , right , and a black @entity213 dress , far right @entity33 in a green @entity215 coat , left , a blue @entity217 skirt suit , second left , a casual denim and cream jumper outfit , right , and a navy @entity222 outfit , far right			1

@entity33 chose the sunny @entity225 dress for her debut appearance in @entity7
was wearing the £ 900 dress as she stepped off an @entity7 @entity36 jet in @entity29 this *morning*
despite *acclaim* , the @entity9 admitted that her *husband* is n't a *big* fan of the bright frock
according to a well - wisher , prince @entity23 said it makes her look ' like a banana '
