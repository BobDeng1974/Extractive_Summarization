the trail then led @entity0 to another @entity41 hacking forum , @entity125 , which had been breached in 2009 by a rival group of hackers from darklife			0
in retaliation , the founders of @entity130 unmasked the people responsible for the hack , posting their photos and other personal information , including phone numbers , addresses and instant messaging logins			0

@entity0 also came upon a profile from 2010 for @entity22 , in which the young man listed his goals in life : marrying his girlfriend , buying a $ 20,000 @entity97 , moving to @entity98 and ‘ world domination			2
