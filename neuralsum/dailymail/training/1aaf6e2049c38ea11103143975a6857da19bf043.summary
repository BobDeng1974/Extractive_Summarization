these jaw - dropping images show the moment a humpback whale leapt majestically from the ocean , ' waving ' to a tourist boat before crashing back down with an almighty splash			1
the photos , taken off the coast of @entity8 by marine tour guide @entity9 , captured a sight rarely seen at such close proximity			1
the 40 ton humpback put on an incredible aerial display , soaring through the air just yards from a boat as shocked onlookers screamed			2
mr @entity9 thought the humpback 's show was over after 20 minutes hiding deep under water , but it suddenly lifted ts entire body out of the water , extending a fin to onlookers before slamming back down , creating a huge splash			1
the giant creature was clearly having a whale of a time as the marine tour guide watched from the safety of a boat off @entity61 , in the @entity62 of @entity8			1
the spectacular display of strength and agility ' blew away ' mr @entity9 , who had never before managed to get so close to a humpback			1
mr @entity9 said : ' huge whale breaches like this are common to see quickly from a distance , but it is exceptionally rare to have it occur close to the boat and have the camera ready			1
' i got this shot out of sheer luck			0
we were focused on this whale whilst it was doing normal tail slapping and half head flops			2
' it took a rest for 20 mins and then without notice or warning , it did a single massive breach			0
' the 31 - year - old amateur photographer was documenting the migration of more than 1,000 whales from the coast of @entity8 to the warmer waters of @entity43 and @entity44 when the humpback appeared splashdown : the whole boat ' erupted in screams ' as the whale came crashing down , creating a huge splash , a stunned mr @entity9 said close encounter : humpback whales are known for their acrobatics , but do not usually put on such displays when they are so near to boats he added : ' i was stunned			1
i 've never seen such a huge , front on and high breach like that			0
the whole boat erupted in screams as it landed			0
' mr @entity9 , from @entity110 , only started taking pictures of marine life six years ago			2
the amateur snapper won his camera in a local photography competition , allowing him to capture bigger and better shots			0
he added : ' people ca n't believe its a real image , everyone always looks twice and are blown away by it			0
' the acrobatic animals can grow up to 50ft long , and have a reputation for throwing themselves out of the water despite weighing up to 40 tons			0
humpback whales were almost hunted to extinction during the 1960s , but a ban has allowed their global population to reach approximately 80,000 .			0
