a dad whose video of he and his nine - month - old baby surfing made waves on the internet is defending his decision to take the infant for a ride after critics called the sport too dangerous			1
@entity10 , 43 , of @entity11 spoke to @entity13 's @entity12 about his choice to involve his little boy in the sport and film it all with his @entity18 camera to upload online this week			1
@entity12 asked , ' i do think a lot of people seeing that video say that 's not something you should do with a baby			0
i 'm never going to put the baby beyond any reach			1
the baby is stuck with me and his legs [ are ] on my stomach			1
' @entity10 said that the sport is not dangerous but is actually enlightening for his son who was blessed to go into the ocean for the first time			2
' my son first try			0
' i encourage you to safely bring your kids to the ocean , after all the ocean is the place where it all began			0
' by far , this is the best sport for your spiritual , mental and physical health			0
' like a pro : the footage ends with the baby breaking out into a big smile as he rests on the board at nine months old , babies , if they are really advanced , might be crawling around on the floor , or shuffling from a to @entity61 however , this tiny tot has been filmed surfing - as his father takes him out on his bodyboard			1
in the video , @entity10 can be seen holding his son , who is unnamed , and getting him ready for a day 's surfing			1
the footage shows dad and baby choosing the largest waves , and they even ended up going through the tube in the middle of the wave			2
although the youngster does seem nervous when going into the cold water , it soon changes to a smile once the board takes to the waves			2
@entity10 does not specify exactly where the video was shot but tagged it as being in @entity11			2
not impressed ... @entity10 's son looks uncomfortable as they ride into a wave the baby is visible at the height of a huge wave , bracing himself for impact , with his father propped up over him the baby looks surprised upon entry into the wave , but handles the impact well as the two ride ride through the middle of the tube of a wave , the baby is all smiles at the motion just chilling : @entity10 , 43 , floats with his son in preparation before entering the waves @entity105 's nerves : at first the youngster does seem a little nervous when entering the cold water , but he soon learns to love the movement through the water the baby is then seen in the water , with waves splashing over his face as he is held on the board			1
at times , the tot does n't look impressed , as the water cascades over him			0
but he ends with a smile as he is joined by another surfer			0
while taking an infant out onto the waves can be dangerous , it is not uncommon for experienced surfers or bodyboarders to introduce their kids to the ocean at a young age			0
pro-surfer @entity128 , 22 , for example , has said that he was only six - months - old when his mother put him in a life vest and sat him on the nose of her surfboard as she paddled into waves .			0
