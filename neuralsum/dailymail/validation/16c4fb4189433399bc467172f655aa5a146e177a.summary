recovery : @entity1 , pictured last october , is clear of cancer after his parents @entity4 and @entity5 took him for pioneering treatment in the @entity7 after fleeing a @entity9 hospital last year the parents of five - year - old brain cancer sufferer @entity1 revealed today their son is clear of the disease			1
@entity4 and @entity14 were put in prison after taking their son out of an @entity17 hospital and going across @entity18 to seek pioneering proton therapy in the @entity7			1
now , some five months after he completed the pioneering treatment , they said @entity1 was making good progress , starting to speak again and able to play with his brothers and sisters in the park			1
his parents told a newspaper he had been given the all - clear by the private clinic that treated him			2
mr @entity1 , 51 , told @entity30 : ' we are absolutely delighted			1
it has justified everything we have gone through , because things are working out for @entity35			0
' if we had left him with the @entity17 we do n't think he would have survived			2
we have saved his life			0
' we could not sleep before we got this news			0
now we are so full of hope for the future			0
we are jumping up and down with joy this is a miracle we thought we would never see			2
' his wife , 46 , added : ' we could not sleep before we got this news — now we are so full of hope for the future			0
we are jumping up and down with joy			0
it is a miracle we thought we would never see			2
' a report issued by the private clinic 's oncology department last week declared @entity52 cancer - free			2
however , the family has yet to return to the @entity54 and are living in their holiday home in @entity57			2
he described the advanced proton beam therapy treatment @entity1 had as ' sniper fire ' which specifically targeted the cancer			1
the couple sparked a manhunt last year when they took their son abroad to seek pioneering proton therapy			1
mr @entity1 said the treatment was ' much less harmful ' than the conventional therapy which doctors at @entity68 intended to give to @entity1			1
the @entity69 faced every parent 's worst nightmare when their son was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour after suffering a series of mystery symptoms			1
and despite threats to revoke their parental rights unless they went along with the therapy , the @entity69 defiantly fled to @entity57 in a bid to get @entity1 to the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) in @entity87 and protect him from the devastating side effects of @entity17 treatment			1
they were arrested by @entity18 authorities and banned from seeing their sick son , with a high court judge only approving the move to @entity87 after they had been released			1
when he finally arrived at the centre in september last year , @entity1 was so sick he was unable to move and had to be fed by tubes			2
but in october , he was pictured smiling and waving to cameras , thrilled at the prospect of returning to the family holiday home in @entity115 , @entity57 , and finishing his treatment there with his parents and older brother @entity119			1
disappearance : the couple sparked a worldwide manhunt when they took @entity1 from @entity68 last august ( pictured @entity125 footage ) since then , he has continued to make encouraging progress and is enjoying a more normal life			1
at the time , mr @entity1 the family said they were so scarred by their nightmare experience that they would not be returning to the @entity54 for the foreseeable future , fearing @entity1 would be ' taken away ' from them			1
their son was largely left alone in a @entity57 hospital during their three - day detention , howling in despair and confusion at being apart from his family			1
held in grimy adjoining cells at a @entity57 police station , mr @entity1 recalled to the mail : ' she [ @entity5 ] was crying : ' @entity1 , where is my @entity1 ? ' on and on and on ' she was saying : ' are you happy now ? we should have stayed in @entity149 — this would never have happened			1
' suddenly it was my fault			0
' mrs @entity1 said : ' i was n't crying for myself in prison , i was crying for @entity1			2
i did n't want him to be alone in a foreign country not understanding the language			0
i was just praying the nurses would feel sorry for him , be with him , so he was n't completely alone			0
' @entity1 had 30 irradiation sessions to fight his rare brain tumour at the @entity87 clinic which has said proton therapy is more effective than radiotherapy because it limits the collateral damage of radiation to other vital organs			1
good news : the @entity69 have stood by their decision and said that the treatment had been so successful that their son , pictured in october , had now been given the all - clear belief : mrs @entity1 said that she believes that if she and her husband had left @entity1 , pictured in september , at the @entity17 hospital , he would not have survived @entity1 was unable to speak or move following surgery in @entity54 and had still not uttered a word in the @entity87 clinic after the treatment			1
mrs @entity1 told @entity30 : ' at the clinic we were trying to get him to speak — then this nurse came in with a needle and he suddenly shouted ' no ! '			2
' we thought it was a miracle			0
it really blew our minds			0
he was just saying ' no ' to everything			0
' he soon progressed to other words — and now chatters away , according to the newspaper			0
the therapy is not available for him on the @entity17 , although the health service has since agreed to fund @entity1 's treatment			1
the outcry over the family 's ordeal led to criticism that police and prosecutors had been too cruel in issuing the @entity18 arrest warrant , which was eventually withdrawn			0
public anger also prompted a nationwide fundraising effort in a bid to help the family			0
dr @entity205 , senior clinical oncologist at @entity206 , told @entity207 's @entity208 : ' it 's very gratifying to hear that he is in remission , and if time goes on and he holds that remission , hopefully that equates with cure			0
' i do not agree that he could not have been in a similar situation had he had orthodox x-ray radiotherapy , which is going on to a very high standard in all the departments in this country			0
' that 's not to say there are no advantages of protons , but i think we could have achieved the remission he is in now with standard radiotherapy			0
