by @entity0 a pensioner has spent £ 20,000 building a pub - in the cupboard under his stairs			0
@entity5 , 66 , has spent the last three years on the labour of love - complete with two cask ales , working optics and traditional 1930s wooden panelling			1
mr @entity5 , a retired construction worker from @entity10 , said : ' i was born in a pub and i ’ve spent most of my life in them so it ’s where i really feel at home			1
' it looks very authentic , just like any other traditional pub you ’d walk into , ' said mr @entity5			0
' the @entity51 ' houses vintage photographs and plaques from his parents ' former pub , the @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 investment : the pub mr waite took £ 20,000 and three years to build ' i think it ’s a great use for a hallway however - most people just walk across their hallway to get upstairs but i can sit down and enjoy a pint in mine			1
' i ’ve tried to match everything to the 1930s era as i love that time , and the rest of my house is fashioned around then			0
' with six bar stools in mr @entity5 ’s local , he can even draw a small crowd , much to the amusement of friends and family who enjoy popping round for the odd tipple			2
he said : ' i now spend most of my day sitting at the bar and whether i 'm drinking coffee or drinking beer , i get to do it in the confines of my very own pub ' he said : ' it ’s quite a surprise for people when they walk through the door - and then of course they all want a free drink			0
' it ’s a nice feature to have in your own home and i ’ve either added £ 30,000 to the value of the house if i sell it to a real - ale fan , or knocked £ 30,000 off			0
' i suppose it is a little strange , but people do strange things , and it ’s just a little bit quirky			1
' mr @entity5 ’s hobby is supported by the 13 years he has spent working at @entity99 part - time			1
he added : ' i used to go into the brewery ’s bar and when i struggled to get full - time work in the construction industry , i got a job doing brewery tours			2
' i know all about making beer , and i know a fair bit about drinking it too			0

@entity5 , 66 , loves pubs so much he *decided* he wanted one at home
so the former builder and part - time brewery worker built ' the @entity51 '
friends and family love popping over for a pint in the snug pub
' i suppose it is a little strange , but people do strange things , ' he said
