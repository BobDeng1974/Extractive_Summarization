@entity0 - to - man with messi @entity2 was only just returning from injury , but clearly @entity4 told him to take care of @entity6			1
whenever @entity6 came into @entity8 ’s midfield area , he was never more than a few yards from the striker , putting him under pressure			1
@entity8 did well for an hour but man - marking is a dying art and i ’m not sure there ’s room for it in the modern game			1
to stay tight you have to forget about being in possession but that badly affects team shape			0
he had just six touches in the first half and two of those were throw - ins			2
he has been one of the most exciting players to watch in the tournament so it was frustrating to see him far from his best			0
he improved in the second half but credit @entity43 for keeping him quiet			2
flying @entity44 : @entity33 is sent tumbling by a slide challenge during the ill - tempered semi-final hauled down : @entity33 is fouled by @entity47 as he tries to break through into space after @entity51 ’s sensational win over @entity52 , this game was disappointing			1
i thought @entity54 would do well thanks to their organisation , but @entity57 were better than i expected			0
both teams worked hard to deny the star men space and it led to a rather uninspiring game			0
it did not help that the referee let plenty of fouls go unpunished			0
that meant players could put in some tough tackles but still get away with it			0
nasty : @entity68 raises his boot to @entity70 after the @entity43 man heads the ball clear , one of many moment of aggression in the match 50 - 50 : @entity76 and @entity77 go for the ball at the same time , resulting in a tangle of legs @entity80 looked lively most of the focus before the match was on @entity6 , but @entity43 ’s best attacking outlet was @entity85			1
i ’ve been impressed with him at @entity86 and his speed causes defenders problems			0
@entity85 did well to find space between @entity90 and @entity91 on the @entity44 left , but @entity43 could not take advantage of the chances he created			1
lunge : @entity90 slides in on @entity85 as @entity97 ( right ) watches on horizontal : @entity85 appears to drop kick @entity99 ( centre ) and @entity102 ( right ) with the ball long gone @entity57 scrape through to final			2

@entity8 performed an old - fashioned man marking job on @entity6
@entity6 **'s** only touch inside the *penalty* *box* came in the *shootout*
@entity33 looked very isolated and had just six touches before half - time
second semi-final failed to reach the heights of @entity52 vs @entity51
@entity43 **'s** best attacking outlet on the night was @entity85
