a couple who knew each other only as penpals in their early teens were reunited after 14 years via @entity4 , and last weekend , they were married			1
@entity5 , now 35 , and @entity6 , 36 , started exchanging letters at the suggestion of mutual friends in 1994 , when @entity5 was 14 and living in @entity10 and @entity6 was 15 and living in @entity11			1
they were both in relationships at the time , only met in person once , but bonded over their shared acting ambitions			2
after four years of writing to and fro , the letters stopped			0
unbeknownst to them , however , they spent the next 14 years living in parallel ; both studied acting in @entity23 and then ended up living a mere three blocks from one another in @entity25 , @entity26			1
last weekend , they were married ( pictured ) as a teen , @entity5 and @entity6 shared a passion for @entity34 and a dream to one day be actors , so their friends put them in touch - as was customary before the age of the internet - via pen and paper			1
' it was like receiving a letter from a kindred spirit who ... just knew what she wanted to do , ' @entity6 told @entity47			2
' so we could talk the same language right out of the gate and that was really rare			0
' the pair enjoyed one brief meeting when @entity5 went to see @entity6 in a play , @entity56 , at a @entity11 theater , but four years and some - 50 letters later , the pair fell out of touch and went their separate ways			1
in fact , both studied acting in @entity23 only a year apart , then moved to @entity25 , @entity26 , where they lived a few blocks apart , worked as actors and audiobook narrators , and even shared the same voiceover agent			2
the passage of time : @entity5 , now 35 , and @entity6 , 36 , started exchanging letters at the suggestion of mutual friends in 1994 , when @entity5 was 14 @entity6 was 15			1
pictured , the couple now precious : they were both in relationships at the time , only met in person once , but bonded over their shared acting ambitions			2
@entity81 , @entity5 's letters , which @entity6 kept for 14 years ' we took the same subway every day , ' @entity5 says			1
' i would get onto the front of the subway and he would get onto the back			0
' in 2011 , @entity5 and @entity6 both happened to join @entity4 , @entity5 reluctantly , and at the urging of her friends			1
' this is n't my story , ' she recalls thinking to herself			0
' this is n't how i 'm going to meet the guy i 'm going to spend the rest of my life with			0
i just do n't think it 's how it 's supposed to happen to me			0
' when @entity6 came across @entity5 's profile and saw they had a 94per cent match , he was intrigued , but did n't recognize her or her cryptic screen name			2
disbelief : @entity5 and @entity6 were reunited on @entity4 in 2011 , when they hit a 94per cent match			1
pictured , piper the night they first re-met , reading her old letters joined : the night the couple were reunited in their shared @entity25 nieghborhood , in june 2011 actors : the newlyweds have since discovered they 'd shared ' many ' mutual friends for years without ever crossing paths			0
pictured in 2013 , at the @entity114 where they performed in @entity116 together ' i wrote to her just like , " hey , do you want to go on a date ? " ' he relays			0
' and a second later i get a message back and it 's like , " @entity123 ! it â€™s @entity5 ! it 's your penpal ! " @entity6 's screen name was his real name , and @entity5 's only way of knowing who he was , since they barely knew each other by face			1
both were utterly ' shocked ' and ' dumbfounded , ' but met a few days later for a casual neighborhood date			0
that very night , they headed back to @entity6 's apartment , where he quickly rummaged around in the back of his closet and retrieved a purple binder , stamped with ' @entity140 , ' containing every single one of her letters			0
the couple quickly fell in love , and in october 2013 , @entity6 proposed to @entity5 in the garden of the lord @entity146 , the @entity11 theater where they had at met just once all those years ago			1
the newlyweds now live together in @entity25 , and have since discovered they 'd shared ' many ' mutual friends for years without ever crossing paths			0
in the end , when pen and paper failed them , acquaintances never matched them and even geography did n't prevail , it was a computer algorithm that finally brought their relationship back full circle .			0
