going ... going ... gone : mr @entity0 misjudges his run and loses his footing as he tumbles over the line flatlining : the @entity3 heavyweight ended up on his back during the game against the @entity45 legs akimbo : mr @entity0 is one of the long - serving members of the @entity3 team , but they slumped to a 4 - 0 defeat it is not just on the football field that @entity3 - and mr @entity0 - are struggling			1
