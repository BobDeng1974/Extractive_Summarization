by @entity0 @entity1 has insisted @entity2 will take nothing for granted as they attempt to defend their @entity5 title			1
the reigning champions launched their defence with a hard - fought 2 - 0 victory at @entity9 on sunday with an efficient , rather than dazzling , display			1
title rivals @entity11 and @entity12 both enjoyed even narrower successes in their opening fixtures , and @entity1 knows there is no room for complacency during a campaign he expects to be as competitive as ever			1
hard work : @entity2 will hope to retain their title this season but @entity1 knows that will be a tough task champions : the @entity26 striker has won the @entity5 twice with @entity2 in 2012 and 2014 the 28 - year - old frontman told @entity28 : ' it 's just the beginning of the season and it will be , definitely , a long season with the five teams fighting for the title			1
this is just the beginning			0
' it 's good to start with a win , but we are not there			0
there are so many games to come and we have to prepare for the next one , for the big game against @entity11 to try to win at home			0
' we have brought in some great new players			0
some of them still need time because it was the @entity46 and a lot of us came later to the pre-season			0
' i think we can still improve a lot			0
each game , we can be better and better and just try to continue where we finished [ at @entity9 ]			1
' @entity1 was a key figure in the win at @entity55 despite not finding his own way on to the scoresheet			1
it was his clever back - heel after he had drawn central defenders @entity60 and @entity61 to the ball which allowed @entity63 to fire @entity2 into the lead against the @entity65 , just as he had done 12 months earlier			1
opening win : @entity63 scored @entity2 's first goal of the new @entity5 season at @entity9 winner : @entity70 , who has signed a new contract , scored the second of @entity2 's goals in the 2 - 0 win video important to start with a win - @entity76 but if @entity63 's 38th - minute intervention gave the visitors the advantage , it was one they were unable to push home until substitute @entity70 beat @entity82 at the second attempt in stoppage time at the end of the game			1
@entity1 said : ' we played very well			2
from the first minute , we were there like the manager wanted us to be , from the first minute to try to press them high , to try to score a goal			2
' we did n't score an early goal , but it was the perfect time , five minutes before half - time , and i think we controlled the game during the 90 minutes , were definitely the better side and deserved this win			2
' new recruit : @entity99 , signed from @entity100 for Â£ 12million , was impressive for @entity2 at @entity9 @entity1 's impressive individual display came amid reports that he is close to signing a new contract at the @entity104 , but it was collective , rather than individual plaudits which were of greater interest to the @entity109 international			1
he said : ' i am very happy because of my performance and the performance of the team because i think we were brilliant			0
' it 's always good to start the season with a win , especially away at @entity9 where it is always tough to go			2
' @entity1 's mood was in sharp contrast to that of @entity9 debutant @entity122 as he and his team - mates emerged from a tight encounter with nothing to show for their efforts			1
manager @entity128 was quick to take positives from a spirited display in the immediate aftermath , and urged his players to take them into saturday 's trip to @entity134			2
dream : despite the result , @entity122 fulfilled his dream by making his debut for boyhood club @entity9 @entity122 told @entity140 : ' we are disappointed with the result			2
you get nothing for good performances , but defeats			0
' we are not going to come up against the quality that @entity2 have every week and we are going to get more chances against the teams who are n't the so - called better teams , so we have got to take the positives out of sunday and look to go there and get some points			1
' tyneside - born @entity122 fulfilled a dream when he made his league debut for the club he supported as a boy after spending the whole of his career until the end of last season with arch - rivals @entity162			0
the 24 - year - old said : ' it was bittersweet , really , coming off with a defeat			0
it would have been fantastic to have come away with at least a point			0
' but it was great to finally have that moment and get it under the belt			0
