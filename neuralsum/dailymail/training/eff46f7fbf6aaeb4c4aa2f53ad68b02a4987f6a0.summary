by @entity0 in her application to take part in @entity4 , @entity1 wrote of how her greatest achievement in life is her three - year - old daughter			1
she was ecstatic to be accepted into the beauty pageant – only to have her dreams dashed weeks later when she was told she could not participate after all			2
the reason ? because she is a mother			2
miss @entity1 , who is a full - time mother to @entity14 and has taken part in some modelling projects , said : ‘ i had started to get really excited about the competition			2
i was really upset when i found out , it ’s a disgrace			0
' i am a proud young mum and i even said in my application that my biggest achievement was having my daughter			1
‘ it was only when a friend mentioned their “ no children ” policy i decided to question it and that is when i was notified by email that i could no longer take part – despite having been accepted two weeks before			1
it is an outdated rule			0
’ proud : ' i even said in my application that my biggest achievement was having my daughter , ' says @entity1 disappointed : @entity1 , left and right with daughter @entity14 , had her initial application for miss @entity4 accepted and spent two weeks rallying support from friends and family to qualify for the next stage sweet : @entity1 , mother to @entity14 , pictured here , claims she was told that despite being accepted she could no longer continue in the competition , due to miss @entity4 's policy of entrants not being allowed to be mothers determined : @entity1 has n't let her experience discourage her ambition and she has now qualified for the @entity58 final of miss @entity59 , which does allow mothers to enter stunning : modelling shots of @entity1 , who has qualified for miss @entity59 after being shunned from @entity4 on account of being a mother director of miss england @entity66 said : ‘ @entity68 and miss @entity4 are both run by mothers who value highly normal family values			1
it is unfair on the child and her family to take the mother away for the year while she travels the globe			0
‘ it raises issues about who would take care of the child			0
surely it seems obvious to anyone that for a mother to devote herself fully to a role such as miss @entity4 it would be unfair on any child			0
’ miss @entity1 , from @entity85 , @entity86 , has not let the experience discourage her and has qualified for the @entity58 final of miss @entity59 , which does allow mums			1
she added : ‘ i am delighted miss @entity59 has a positive attitude towards mothers			0
