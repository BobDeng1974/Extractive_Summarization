@entity0 has been warned by @entity1 that he must water down his plans to curb benefits for @entity5 migrants or they will be blocked			1
@entity6 , @entity1 's deputy foreign minister , insisted the rules would have to apply to @entity8 as well as workers from other parts of @entity11			1
mr @entity0 used his long - awaited immigration speech last week to insist that curbs on tax credits , child benefits , jobseekers allowance and council housing will be a key demand for his talks on renegotiating @entity8 's @entity5 membership			1
for those in work , they would be barred from claiming handouts like housing benefit or tax credits until they have being in the @entity8 for four years			1
there will also be a ban on ' exporting ' child benefit for children living in other @entity5 countries			0
mr @entity0 admitted that his proposals would require treaty change but would need support from across the @entity5 to push through such measures			2
mr @entity6 said it was an ' absolute red line ' for his government that there is no discrimination in the welfare system on grounds of nationality			2
he said the plans to stop migrants from claiming benefits for the first four years after they arrive in @entity8 as well as kick out those who fail to find work after six months would go against all existing laws and insisted @entity1 would oppose the plans as they stand			1
@entity0 has threatened to block any new members joining the @entity5 without limits on their citizens flocking to @entity8 for work for workers from the @entity5 : no in - work benefits until they have been in @entity8 for four years no social housing for four years no child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the @entity8 for unemployed @entity5 migrants : no support from the @entity8 taxpayer deportation if they do not get a job for six months other measures include : impose restrictions on @entity5 migrants bringing in family members from outside the @entity5 @entity80 bans on rough sleepers , beggars and fraudsters returning to the @entity8 tougher rules on deporting foriegn criminals refusing to allow other countries to join the @entity5 without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached @entity8 levels mr @entity6 told @entity93 : ' if one wants to get away with all the benefits that are enshrined in the regulation of @entity5 and treat immigrants from @entity5 differently , and for example only pay benefits after four years of their stay in @entity8 or extradite people who ca n't find work , that would be against all the existing laws of the @entity5 and obviously that would be a red line for us			1
' ' the @entity1 government is quite ready to talk about abuses of existing systems , sham marriages , extraditing criminals and so forth			0
' but to be truthful this is not the problem , it is marginal			0
when it comes to changing the rules in the @entity5 , when it comes to social support and so forth , when it comes to undermining the existing laws , obviously we are going to react quite strongly and we are going to be against			0
' but the most important thing is that @entity0 wants to talk about it and does n't want to change policies unilaterally			0
' he added : ' this is an absolute red line , that there is no discrimination on grounds of nationality			0
if @entity8 were to change its policy , for example , into contributory system in which everyone has to pay in to get some money from the system we then could talk about changes if they were absolutely non-discriminatory			0
' mr @entity0 made clear that without agreement on allowing the @entity8 to dramatically curtail the pull factors which make it so attractive to @entity5 migrants , he will ' rule nothing out ' â€“ raising the prospect of backing @entity8 's exit from the @entity5 if he does not get his way			1
in an apparent attempt to win the support of countries like @entity1 , he appealed to other @entity11 nations who have seen thousands of their citizens move to the @entity8 to support limiting movement across the continent			2
but he warned @entity8 will veto any new countries joining the @entity5 unless he gets his way on imposing limits on workers from poor countries moving in search of work .			0
