clubbers are being warned of the risk of overdosing on ' super strength ' ecstasy , as tests reveal the drug 's purity is at its highest level for ten years			1
tests carried out on drugs which were seized during the summer show a huge rise in the amount of @entity12 contained in the party drug			1
in one case , the government warned one batch had been tested to have about two - and - a - half times the standard @entity12 dose - the active ingredient in ecstasy - per pill			1
the perceived rise in purity has prompted the @entity33 in @entity34 ( @entity35 ) , one of the biggest clubs in the country , to warn revellers about the dangers of increased purity before they visit the venue			1
@entity43 , director of @entity35 , said the concern was that those who are used to taking two or three tablets of a lower purity will continue to do so , potentially sparking fatal consequences			0
while the club says it does not condone drug - taking , it has started warning about ' very high purity ' drugs in circulation on its @entity56 feed			1
@entity57 , 30 , died after unknowingly taking almost 15 times the recreational dose of @entity12 before visiting the @entity33 , @entity34 mr @entity43 told the @entity59 : ' i would much rather warn people that the quality is that high and that it could cause all these issues if you take too much			1
' @entity66 , professor of criminology at @entity67 , who regularly tests drugs , says the average ecstasy tablet now contains 100mg of @entity12			1
in 2009 the average ecstasy pill contained just 20 - 30mg			2
an ' acceptable ' dose for an average - sized adult during one drug - taking session is 70 - 75mg , she says			2
ms @entity66 said the increased purity of ecstasy was probably due to manufacturers developing new ways to synthesise the drug			2
last year , @entity35 started warning customers of the dangers of @entity81 , a potentially lethal drug often sold under the banner of @entity12			1
though no clubbers have been taken to hospital since the start of the season in september , about four of the 2,000 punters who attend each night end up being treated by on - site paramedics , mostly for drug - related issues			2
in an inquest earlier this month , the court heard how @entity93 worker @entity57 , 30 , died from ecstasy and cocaine poisoning			0
he unknowingly took almost 15 times the recreational dose of @entity12 before entering the club , the coroner ruled			1
tests showed a concentration of 4.42mg of @entity12 in his blood			2
typical recreational use normally measuring just 0.3mg			0
@entity104 - @entity103 has called for a change to @entity107 drug policy , after her daughter @entity108 died from taking a ecstasy tablet which was 91 per cent pure			2
the average is around 58 per cent earlier this year , @entity104 - @entity103 , the mother of 15 - year - old @entity108 , who died in 2013 , called for drugs to be legalised			0
@entity108 , from @entity112 , had consumed a dose which was 91 per cent pure			0
the average street purity is 58 per cent			0
speaking after the inquest into her daughter 's death , miss @entity103 said : ' we need strict and responsible regulation			0
@entity33 in @entity34 ( pictured ) has started warning clubbers about the increased purity of ecstasy tablets ' i 'm not a radical person , this has been well considered and thought out			1
if we had that , @entity108 would have been able to make an informed decision			0
' @entity108 wanted to get high , she did n't want to die - no parent wants either , but one of those is preferable to the other			0
' @entity133 coroner @entity132 recorded a conclusion of accidental death at the inquest at @entity137 in @entity112			0
he said : ' it is a terrible loss and i think we can only say that it may at least serve as a warning to young people who may take , or think of taking , ecstasy or @entity12			1
' what is clear is that there is no way of knowing what it is made up of or what the purity level is			0
so , as i say , this is a very stark warning of what can happen			0

tests over the summer show purity of ecstasy is at its highest for ten years
in one batch , amount of @entity12 was two - and - a - half times the standard dose
deaths caused by the party drug have risen from eight in 2010 to 43 in 2013
