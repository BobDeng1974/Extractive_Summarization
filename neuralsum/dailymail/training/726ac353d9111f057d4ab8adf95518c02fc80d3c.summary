‘ people kept telling my mum i would n’t be able to do the things other kids could			2
but she refused to listen and encouraged me to take part in all the normal childhood activities			2
’ as the years went by @entity10 ’s vision slowly improved and she did n’t give her looks much thought until she hit puberty at secondary school			1
that ’s when she realised her looks were unusual			2
‘ girls would sneer and ask why i was so pale as they changed for @entity58 , ’ she recalls			2
every day @entity10 would carry the social stigma of being different			1

despite her nerves , and with her mother ’s encouragement @entity10 entered the competition ‘ when the day arrived ( last september ) i was petrified as i stepped out onto the stage at the @entity111 in @entity112			1
’ but @entity10 ’s misgivings were soon alleviated when a huge cheer erupted when she walked on in a black latex catsuit and full make up with her hair coaxed up into an outrageous style			1
she went on to be crowned @entity105 and be given a modelling contract			0
‘ @entity120 could n’t stop hugging me			0
‘ i told you you ’re day to shine would come , ’ she told me			0
