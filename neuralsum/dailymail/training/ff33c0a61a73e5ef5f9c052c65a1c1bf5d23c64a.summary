@entity0 last night denied using an @entity2 company to help avoid paying up to £ 200,000 in @entity4 tax			1
the singer ’s spokesman claimed she had created @entity7 to deal with her international earnings simply because her accountant is @entity2 rather than as a way of paying a lower rate of company tax			1
@entity13 , which was set up in 2001 , and its @entity4 - based parent company @entity15 , were put into voluntary liquidation in the last two months , prompting speculation the star is keen to avoid accusations she is dodging @entity4 tax			1
@entity0 ( in between @entity20 and @entity21 ) was introduced to the accountant @entity22 by her former manager @entity23 ( left ) however last night @entity25 ’s publicist @entity24 insisted the change in her financial arrangements was because her accountant @entity22 had moved to @entity29			2

the accountant was recommended by @entity23 , who at the time managed her as part of @entity33			0
her accountant has recently set up an office in @entity29 so @entity0 ’s @entity2 company has been dissolved			0
’ the change in @entity25 ’s tax affairs came just days before @entity43 , @entity44 and dozens of other celebrities learned they are liable for millions in unpaid taxes after @entity47 ruled an investment vehicle they had used was a tax avoidance scam			2
while @entity25 ’s actions are legal , the last accounts for @entity13 showed assets of £ 2.5 million at the end of 2012 , suggesting the star had funnelled at least this much through the company			1
@entity33 : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity0 and @entity59 if this was the case the singer would have avoided paying £ 200,000 in tax that would have been owed in @entity4			2
this is the difference between @entity2 ’s 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate compared to the 21 per cent rate in the @entity4			0
documents for the liquidation of the company , @entity68 – which in 2013 declared only £ 1 in net assets – now show it has £ 1.88 million funds , which is likely to be paid to @entity25 as the company ’s sole owner			1
