by @entity0 last updated at 3:51 pm on 12th december 2011 anger : @entity2 said the human rights laws had ' fallen into disrepute ' and were seen as protecting criminals , terror suspects and illegal immigrants at the expense of everyone else human rights laws are being interpreted in a way that is ‘ thoroughly bonkers ’ – according to @entity14 ’s own human rights chief			1
@entity2 , head of the @entity15 , said the laws had ‘ fallen into disrepute ’ and were seen as protecting criminals , terror suspects and illegal immigrants at the expense of everyone else			2
these rights should not be ‘ the exclusive property of minorities ’			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ almost every morning i am confronted with examples of how the @entity23 is being used which any reasonable person would describe as thoroughly bonkers			0
‘ prison service vans that travel 90 miles to take a prisoner 90 yards ; paedophiles freed to leer at children in the very parks where they have committed horrific crimes			0
’ mr @entity2 also attacked plans by secularists to use the @entity23 to stop @entity34 prayers being said before council meetings			1
mr @entity2 said he ‘ dropped his coffee ’ when he heard @entity38 , executive director of the @entity39 , saying on the radio that he wanted to use the act to prosecute councillors in @entity43			0
he said the move was ‘ nonsense on stilts ’			0
embarrassed : @entity45 said @entity34 prayers at @entity48 council breached his human right to freedom of belief			1
he has taken the case to court the @entity39 has launched legal action against @entity55 , claiming council meetings should be ‘ equally welcoming to everyone living in the local community ’ and should therefore be ‘ religiously - neutral and secular ’			1
it had supported former @entity48 councillor @entity45 , who insisted the tradition breached his human right to freedom of belief			0
mr @entity45 said he was ‘ disadvantaged and embarrassed ’ when @entity34 prayers were said in the council chamber			1
his case is being considered by the @entity64			0
the @entity39 has based its legal challenge on the claim that mr @entity45 , as an atheist , should not be subjected to religious ritual , and that to do so broke his right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion			0
however it has emerged mr @entity45 stopped being a councillor in may			0
mr @entity2 said human rights laws should not be ‘ used or twisted to prevent public servants doing things which protect and serve the public ’			1
marking @entity78 on saturday , he said such laws were the ‘ last line of defence ’ for elderly , disabled or vulnerable @entity14 who are mistreated or neglected			0
he added : ‘ human rights should help us better protect vulnerable people who are targeted with violence because of who they are , or who suffer because our police , local councils and courts do n’t take their calls seriously or provide enough support to get them justice			1
‘ but while we must defend human rights tenaciously , it is also essential that supporters of human rights recognise and address the reasons why these great principles have fallen into disrepute			2
‘ for too many people nowadays human rights have come to mean the defence of the rights of unpopular minorities – of criminals , terror suspects and illegal immigrants – at the expense of everybody else			1
’ his comments came as @entity114 ’s human rights chief prepared to launch a fresh attack on @entity14 for denying prisoners the right to vote			2
@entity118 , the @entity114 commissioner for human rights , also attacked @entity121 plans for a @entity14 @entity122			2
mr @entity118 will say in a speech tomorrow that any ‘ weakening ’ the @entity23 would encourage autocratic governments in other countries to ignore human rights laws			2
