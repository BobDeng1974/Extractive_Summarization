@entity0 and @entity1 finally came face to face as they weighed in ahead of their grudge match on saturday night			1
until they both stepped on the scales at the @entity9 cinema in @entity10 , @entity5 had refused to square off with his opponent and also failed to attend the final press conference this week			2
both men were comfortably inside the 160lb limit for a fight that looks set to overshadow the heavyweight rematch between @entity17 and @entity18 at the @entity19			1
and the pair locked eyes for several minutes in front of several hundred fans with both refusing to face the front for photographs			1
@entity1 eventually broke the intense stare as @entity5 's father watched on			1
each brings a perfect record to the ring with @entity1 ' @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity40 middleweight titles on the line			1
the winner will also earn a shot at the @entity45 world title which will be contested by @entity46 and @entity47 in @entity48 next month			2
without doubt , @entity1 has proved himself against a higher calibre of opponent to date but as the fight draws closer , opinion is increasingly divided			1
@entity0 and @entity1 looks set to overshadow the main event between @entity17 and @entity18 @entity56 fist pumps as his son weighs - in for saturday 's fight at @entity59 's @entity19 and @entity1 admitted earlier this week that this was the first fight he had prepared for in a professional manner			1
he spent time in @entity62 with trainer @entity63 and at a media workout on tuesday was only a couple of pounds over the middleweight limit			1
' in my professional boxing career i 've had 20 fights and i 've won those 20 fights on work ethic alone because i have n't done my diet right , ' he said			2
' i know now i ca n't win a world title living the lifestyle i was living before			0
kebabs , food , this , that , walking around at 15 stone			0
this time last year i was 16 stone – it was just a joke			0
i know i ca n't live that lifestyle – the elite fighters do n't do it			0
' when i won the @entity40 title in my last fight , the night before the weigh - in i got six - and - a - half pounds off in a sauna and i thought , " i never want to do that again "			1
' some people have to learn from a loss but luckily enough i did n't have to and i got the win but i knew i had to learn from it			0
' both boxers have a perfect record and the winner will have a shot at the @entity45 middleweight title @entity1 ' @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity40 middleweight titles are on the line on saturday @entity5 , meanwhile , believes he has won the mental battle before the first bell			1
' i can see he is not mentally ready to face what is going to be brought to him on saturday night , ' he said			2
' i could see he ’s not ready at the press conference , with his nervous laughing and talking like he is a school kid			0
it ’s going to be complete domination on my part in this fight			2
' from day one of my professional career i have had people saying all types of things to me – from social media to trolls to haters			0
they have always been insulting me , whether it ’s because they doubt my abilities or they did n’t like my dad so they do n’t want me to succeed			0
' so i ’m used to insults and immune to any bad words that are directed towards me			0
he is not getting to me but i am getting to him by not reacting to the dumb things he says			0
