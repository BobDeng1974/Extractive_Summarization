by @entity0 published : 18:37 est , 26 october 2013 updated : 22:33 est , 26 october 2013 nearly two - thirds of voters oppose planned hikes in green taxes – and back @entity5 in his battle with @entity7 to ‘ roll back ’ the levies			1
a total of 60 per cent of voters object to the charges , which will hit households with an extra £ 270 per year on their energy bills by 2020			1
just 18 per cent support the taxes			1
the findings , in a @entity17 poll , come after a week in which double - digit hikes by the energy companies dominated debate at @entity22			0
roll back row : @entity5 is locked in a battle with his deputy @entity7 over planned hikes in green taxes the row over heating bills was galvanised last month when @entity29 pledged to freeze bills for two years after the next election if he becomes prime minister			1
but our survey reveals mr @entity5 ’s promise last week to cut the levies is backed by more people ( 40 per cent ) than mr @entity29 ’s freeze ( 33 per cent )			1
and only seven per cent back mr @entity7			1
the public seem sceptical about whether mr @entity29 ’s freeze is workable : a majority , 54 per cent , think the energy companies will just hike their prices before or after the freeze to compensate for lost revenues			2
big promise : @entity29 pledged to freeze bills for two years should he win the next election the @entity47 poll shows 61 per cent support for mr @entity5 ’s move , against just 11 per cent who want to keep the taxes in place			1
the energy firms say the compulsory levies – such as the £ 33 which the typical family pays each year in subsidies for wind farms and solar parks – have contributed to their price rises			1
last week ex-prime minister sir @entity61 warned surging bills meant that millions of people would face a choice between ‘ heating and eating ’ this winter			0
a total of 38 per cent of those asked by @entity17 said they have already had to cut back on essential purchases such as food to afford their heating bills			1
this rises to 56 per cent of those in the poorest social groups			2
if extrapolated to the nation at large , it would mean 19 million people have had to choose between ‘ heating and eating ’			0
it is clear from the poll who voters blame for the hikes : 59 per cent cite the firms while just 15 per cent blame the government			2
the same proportion blames the last @entity86			0
the poll has @entity86 on 35 per cent , the @entity89 29 , the @entity90 on 12 and @entity91 17			0
@entity17 interviewed 1,000 people on friday			0
electricity costs are still certain to rise massively over the next seven years to pay for the shift to renewable energy – even if @entity5 succeeds in his plan to trim green levies , writes @entity98			1
the reason is the new @entity100 which commits @entity101 to colossal increases in subsidies for renewables such as wind and solar power			0
a @entity108 document says the subsidies will rise steadily from about £ 2.35 billion now to £ 7.6 billion in 2020 - 21			2
energy expert @entity110 , of @entity111 , says green levies are likely to cost households an average of £ 400 a year just for electricity – minus mall reductions mr @entity5 hopes to make by trimming the budget for items such as insulation			1
these eye - watering sums are the consequence of @entity101 ’s earlier pledge to cut overall carbon dioxide emissions by 15 per cent by 2020 , enshrined in the 2008 @entity124 – piloted by then energy secretary @entity29			1
it is much harder to cut emissions from transport and heating , so almost the entire cut must be absorbed by the power industry			0
to meet the @entity124 ’s legally binding target , it must triple the proportion of electricity made by renewables to 33 per cent , requiring an investment of about £ 100 billion			2
a further subsidy is to be paid to fossil fuel power station operators whose plants would otherwise become uneconomic			0
it is expected this will cost another £ 15 per home			0
but experts say if subsidies look expensive in 2020 , they will cost far more ten years later			0
under the official ‘ @entity147 ’ , set by the government ’s @entity148 , the @entity101 power sector is supposed to have cut its emissions from electricity generation by about 90 per cent in 2030			2
mr @entity110 says this is likely to require more than £ 300 billion investment in nuclear plants and renewables .			0

a full 60 per cent of voters object to paying ' green taxes '
majority backs @entity5 *'s* promise to cut back on levies
charges will see households pay extra £ 270 a year by 2020
