how do deals still go through after the window closes on transfer deadline day ? why are there always some deals confirmed after the clock has ticked past 11pm ? it is called the ' deal sheet ' , and it allows clubs up to an extra two hours after the deadline to get their business done			1
@entity12 confirmed the signing of @entity14 from @entity15 after the deadline ' sometimes it is not easy for clubs to get everything on a deal completed and sent over to the @entity21 by 11pm , ' says premierleague.com			2
' the deal sheets allows a club to confirm that a deal has been reached to allow for additional time to submit the remaining documentation			0
' the sheet can not be used before 9pm and needs to arrive fully completed before the transfer window closes			2
' once the sheet arrives , clubs have an additional two hours after the window closes to submit the full paperwork			2
but if a club are looking to complete an international transfer , it still has to comply with the @entity37 deadline of midnight			0
' so it means that for domestic deals , as long as the sheet is submitted in full after 9pm , clubs have until 1am to finalise their deals and send the paperwork through to the @entity21			0
this is why transfers such as @entity14 's switch from @entity15 to @entity12 can go through up to two hours after the 11pm deadline			1
@entity48 have completed the signing of @entity51 striker @entity50 for @entity48 's signing of @entity50 from @entity51 , however , the @entity52 had just an hour after the deadline			1
this is because the @entity21 allows two hours after the deadline - that is their decision - but international transfers must comply with the @entity60 ( @entity37 ) deadline of midnight - therefore only giving clubs one hour after the deadline			0
what is @entity60 's @entity37 ? @entity60 â€™s @entity37 is an online database to which all information must be uploaded for the transfer to gain international clearance			0
a deal sheet from the 2014 summer transfer window deadline day			1
