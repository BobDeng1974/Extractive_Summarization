it was a more muted affair for president @entity1 in @entity2 today as he spoke at @entity2 's iconic @entity3 before an invite - only crowd of 4,500 guests - a remarkable difference from the rock - star welcome he received five years ago in front of 195,500 cheering supporters			1
then , @entity1 had it all to play for - the glowing presidential candidate symbolizing @entity13 's revived hope for the future			2
this time , he arrived back in @entity2 under the cloud of @entity17 surveillance programs which have outraged many @entity18 and the ever - growing crisis in @entity20			2
the president removed his jacket and rolled up his sleeves as he battled the @entity25 temperature on wednesday , quipping : ' people of @entity2 , your welcome is so warm i 'm going to take off my jacket			1
he used the bulk of his speech to call for a reduction in the world 's nuclear stockpiles - as he stood behind high walls of bullet - proof glass in the public square			0
the two - inch thick sheets are routinely used when the president appears before large crowds in public spaces			0
appealing for a new citizen activism , @entity1 renewed his call for the world to confront climate change , a danger he called ' the global threat of our time '			0
in a wide - ranging speech that enumerated a litany of challenges facing the world , @entity1 said he wanted to reignite the spirit that @entity2 displayed when it fought to reunite itself during the @entity93			1
' today 's threats are not as stark as they were half a century ago , but the struggle for freedom and security and human dignity , that struggle goes on , ' @entity1 said at the city 's historic @entity3 under a bright , hot sun. ' " and i come here to this city of hope because the test of our time demands the same fighting spirit that defined @entity2 a half - century ago			1
' the @entity50 press had mixed reviews for @entity1 on wednesday , a marked difference from five years ago when ' @entity1 - mania ' greeted him in the streets			0
national newspaper @entity112 published an article online on the @entity2 speech , saying that @entity1 appeared to be the ' young , fresh , uninhibited ' political force he was five years ago - but that the time between his speeches has been marked by ' bitter disappointment '			1
the article said @entity1 's battles over gun control and equality for same - sex marriage must be remembered , otherwise his speech in @entity2 could be seen as just ' nice words ' in light of his decisions on @entity127 and the @entity17 surveillance			1
reflective : the thick sheets of bullet - proof glass in front of and behind the president can been seen in this wide angle shot welcome back mr president : @entity1 returned @entity2 to make a speech following his rousing address in 2008 while he was still a presidential candidate how did i do ? @entity1 gestures to @entity2 mayor @entity138 at the @entity3 strong words : @entity13 president @entity1 gives a speech in front of @entity2 's landmark the @entity3 on june 19 rousing words : @entity1 addresses the crowd in @entity2 from behind safety glass the president called for a one - third reduction of @entity13 and @entity150 nuclear stockpiles in his speech , saying it is possible to ensure @entity13 security and a strong deterrent while also limiting nuclear weapons			1
@entity1 's address comes nearly 50 years after @entity53 's famous @entity93 speech in the once - divided city			1
@entity1 's comments today in @entity2 about ' breaking down the walls ' come tinged with irony as the president delivered his remarks behind thick walls of bullet - proof glass			1
the safety measure has been a constant presence throughout his presidency when he makes appearances in large public spaces			0
the last time that @entity1 spoke to 200,000 people in @entity2 , there was no safety glass - but then , he was not yet president			1
it was put up at his victory speech in november 2008 , when @entity1 and family waved to supporters behind the two - inch thick walls			2
since then , it has been in constant use			0
the reported $ 100million cost of @entity1 's trip to @entity184 this month includes three trucks with sheets of bullet ­ proof glass - some of which will be used to cover hotel windows			2
@entity1 told @entity2 that countries should not focus inwards and that in order to be stronger we need to break down the walls in our hearts			1
he added : ' when @entity18 and @entity13 lead with our hopes instead of our fears we achieve things no other nations can do			0
' he challenged @entity13 and @entity18 not to become complacent even though the @entity93 is over			0
@entity1 says there 's a temptation to turn inward now that barbed wire and concrete walls no longer separate @entity203 in @entity2			2
he said that he returned to @entity2 because the tests of our time require the same fighting spirit			0
@entity1 added : ' our work is not yet done			0
' other than his landmark speech , the president spent wednesday in talks with @entity50 chancellor @entity49 and other top politicians including president @entity213			0
he touched down with his family in the @entity50 capital on tuesday night , waving to the crowds gathered at @entity217			0
his wife @entity218 and daughters @entity220 and @entity221 visited the city 's holocaust memorial on wednesday , accompanied by the president 's half - sister @entity224 , who studied in @entity226			0
strong words : @entity1 spoke about reducing nuclear arms during his speech today echoes of history : @entity1 reference @entity53 's famous words at the @entity3 in @entity2 phew ! @entity1 appeared to struggle in the heat today as the temperatures in @entity2 soared to @entity25 political friends : @entity13 ambassador to @entity226 @entity237 and @entity238 , half - sister of the president , wait for his speech in front of @entity3			1
five years ago , when he was still seeking election as president , @entity1 received a rapturous reception on a brief tour of @entity18 where he was greeted as a leader who could give the world a fresh start after the controversial presidency of @entity250			2
now he is a much more divisive figure - although his re-election last year was welcomed by most @entity18 , recent revelations about his administration 's spying on internet communications have tarnished his record in the eyes of many			0
mr @entity1 's speech tomorrow will inevitably be compared with @entity53 's , which took place on june 26 , 1963 at the @entity261 , a few miles away from the @entity262 which had been under construction over the previous two years			1
@entity53 's speech , considered one of his best , held up @entity226 as a symbol of freedom on the front line of the battle against communism			2
it featured the famous line : ' all free men , wherever they may live , are citizens of @entity2 , and therefore , as a free man , i take pride in the words , " ich bin ein @entity281 ! " ' sombre occasion : first lady @entity283 visits the @entity284 to the @entity285 on wednesday with her daughters @entity220 and @entity221 and husband 's half - sister @entity224 keeping close watch : police monitor the area prior to the arrival of president @entity1 at the @entity3 anticipation : guests wait before the speech of @entity1 to invited guests in front of the @entity3 at @entity298 clearing the decks : a man wraps up the @entity13 flag after the @entity1 speech at the @entity3 @entity303 : @entity53 delivered an iconic speech in @entity2 on 26 june , 1963 - almost exactly 50 years ago			1
