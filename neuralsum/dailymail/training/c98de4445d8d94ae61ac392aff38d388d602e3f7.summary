by @entity0 for @entity1 over 1.8 million images of @entity3 have been taken from space - and @entity5 hopes internet users can help it pinpoint exactly what they show			1
a new online sites hopes user 's will be able to spot their city in the images			1
they will then form part of a huge online database of space pictures			1
the @entity22 image will be loaded in the left panel and a map on the right one			2
the aim is try to identify the city			2
users have some simple tools , including zooming in and out , dragging , and even rotating the image ( click on shift and the left mouse button )			2
when you identify a picture , just click on the map to identify its position			2
the longitude and latitude coordinates will appear on the list			2
the @entity42 to astronaut photography of @entity3 , @entity5 is making available images ranging from the @entity46 missions of the 1960s to photos recently snapped from the @entity22			1
the hope , @entity5 says , is that the images ' could help save energy , contribute to better human health and safety and improve our understanding of atmospheric chemistry			1
' the catalog contains more than 1.8 million photos , about 1.3 million of them from the space station and roughly 30 % of them taken at night			1
the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) is leading a project called cities at night to catalog the images			1
it includes three citizen science components : @entity67 of @entity22 , @entity68 , and @entity69			1
@entity67 asks people to sort images into those of cities , stars and other objects			1
' anyone can help , ' says @entity77 , a @entity78 student at @entity61			0
' in fact , without the help of citizens , it is almost impossible to use these images scientifically			1
' algorithms can not distinguish between stars , cities , and other objects , such as the moon			0
humans are much more efficient for complex image analysis			0
' for @entity68 , citizen scientists use their knowledge of local geography to identify points in night images and match them to positions on maps			1
as @entity77 explains , a resident of a city can likely identify its features more easily than someone who does not live there			0
this geo - referenced data will be used to generate light maps of cities			0
lost at @entity68 requires the most skill , seeking to identify cities in images encompassing a circle 310 miles around			1
the images include major cities such as this one - which @entity5 admits it can not identify itself			1
volunteers use a special online app to pinpoint exactly where the image is from ' we do n't know which direction the astronaut pointed the camera , only where the station was at the time the image was taken , ' explains @entity77			1
' some images are bright cities but others are small towns			1
' it is like a puzzle with 300,000 pieces			0
' so far , hundreds of volunteers have classified nearly 20,000 images , but to ensure accuracy , each one should be classified by multiple individuals			1
one of the outcomes of the project will be determining the optimum number of people needed to inspect each image , but its primary goal is producing an open atlas of night time images available any time for use by the media , public , and scientists			1
scientists can , for example , use colors in images to estimate the types of light sources and , thus , the energy efficiency of a particular city			1
researchers could use the data to compare the lighting and the economic health of a city as well			0
' a clear example is comparison of @entity162 and @entity163 , ' @entity77 says			0
' @entity162 is the capital of @entity165 , a country facing a major economic crisis			0
' it is much brighter in astronaut images than @entity163 , the capital of @entity169 , the country with the healthiest economy in @entity171			1
this geo - referenced data will be used to generate light maps of cities			0
' perhaps that is an indication that @entity169 more efficiently manages its resources			0
' the images can provide evidence and data to verify that			2
' other potential applications include evaluating lighting for road and public safety and correlating light pollution with effects on human health and biodiversity			0
' but scientists need your help to make that happen			0
' @entity5 says the images ' could help save energy , contribute to better human health and safety and improve our understanding of atmospheric chemistry			1
' hundreds of volunteers have stepped up so far , classifying almost 20,000 photos , but @entity5 says multiple individuals should review each image to ensure accuracy			1
before 2003 , night images from the space station could be blurry , even with high - speed film and manual tracking , because the station moves at about 17,500 mph			2
in 2003 , enterprising astronaut @entity210 used a drill and assorted parts he found on the station to cobble together a ' barn - door tracker , ' a lower - tech predecessor to the @entity217 's @entity216 , which was installed at the space station nine years later			0
@entity216 's motorized tripod compensates for the space station 's speed , providing what @entity5 scientist @entity222 says are the highest - resolution night images from orbit			1
satellites collect data more regularly , but the photos tend to be lower resolution			0
' now the pictures are clear , but their location may not be , which limits their usefulness			2
' that 's where citizen science comes in , ' the @entity5 news release says			1
hundreds of volunteers have stepped up so far , classifying almost 20,000 photos , but @entity5 says multiple individuals should review each image to ensure accuracy			1
the @entity61 is spearheading efforts to catalog the photos and corral citizen input			0
it has created three projects : 1			0
this is the easiest project , as it requires no scientific expertise			0
' anyone can help ' by sorting the images into the categories : cities , stars or other objects , said @entity77 , doctoral student at @entity61			2
' without the help of citizens , it is almost impossible to use these images scientifically			2
algorithms can not distinguish between stars , cities and other objects , such as the moon			0
humans are much more efficient for complex image analysis , ' he said			0
looking at night images , citizen scientists can tap their knowledge of local geography to match photos with positions on maps			2
residents of a city can more easily identify a city 's features than those who do n't live there , @entity77 said			0
the data will be used to generate light maps of cities			0
this is the trickiest , as it aims to identify cities in photos with 310 - mile circumferences			0
' we do n't know which direction the astronaut pointed the camera , only where the station was at the time the image was taken , ' @entity77 said			0
' some images are bright cities , but others are small towns			2
it is like a puzzle with 300,000 pieces			0

@entity5 database includes over 1.8 million pictures of @entity3
has asked for help in identifying exactly what they show
all images will be available online for free
