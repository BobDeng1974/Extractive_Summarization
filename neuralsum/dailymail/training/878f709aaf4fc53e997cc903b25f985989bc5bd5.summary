@entity1 football fans tuning in to see @entity4 ’s highly - anticipated @entity3 debut at @entity5 will miss the first 15 minutes of @entity6			1
the game – on saturday , october 25 - kicks off at 5pm ( bst ) but broadcasting rules in the @entity1 mean @entity9 can not show any action until 5.15pm			2
