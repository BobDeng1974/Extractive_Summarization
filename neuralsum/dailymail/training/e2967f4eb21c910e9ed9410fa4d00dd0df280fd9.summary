@entity0 , now 47 , suffered a range of horrific symptoms for seven years before discovering high levels of calcium were to blame a mother struck down with a mystery illness for seven years finally diagnosed herself after googling her symptoms on the internet in desperation			1
@entity0 was so bloated she looked nine months pregnant and the excruciating pains in her joints and overwhelming tiredness had forced her to give up work as a wedding photographer			1
despite seeing several doctors - and even undergoing major surgery - her crippling symptoms continued			2
in desperation , she turned to the internet - and just moments later found the answer that would change her life			0
the search results indicated she was suffering from a condition called hyperparathyroidism			1
here , tiny parathyroid glands in the neck which control calcium levels malfunction , causing an excess of calcium in the blood			1
this , in turn , was causing her symptoms such as memory loss , depression , extreme tiredness and bloating			1
the mother - of - one , now 47 , says she had always been fit and healthy and loved her job as a wedding photographer			2
but a decade ago she began to suffer horrific pain in her shoulders , arms , hands and legs			2
' at first doctors said it was arthritis , but tests proved otherwise , ' she told @entity50			0
' it got to the point where i could n't hold a camera any more			0
' as the months passed , she began to develop other worrying symptoms , such as severe memory loss and confusion			1
she said : ‘ it was like i was trying to think through a fog			0
i ’d start sentences then could n’t find the word			0
' i ’d taken a job a new job at an electrical store , but i ’d get confused at the till			0
‘ or , i ’d be going somewhere then forget where i was heading			0
she also suffered crippling headaches , chest pains and heartburn - and felt constantly thirsty			2
' when doctors kept suggesting depression and stress i wanted to scream - i knew it was n’t just that , ' says ms @entity0 , who lives in @entity79			1
shortly after she was prescribed medication for high blood pressure - and says she became horrified at her appearance			2
' when i looked in the mirror , i did n't recognise myself			0
my hair was falling out and my stomach was so bloated i looked like i was nine month ’s pregnant			0
ms @entity0 was so bloated she looked nine months pregnant - and even required surgery to expand her airways as her nose was so blocked she could barely breathe ‘ people kept asking me when the baby was due			1
' doctors then suggested her symptoms could be down to the menopause - and scans revealed she had a condition called adenomyosis , which affects the lining of the uterus			1
but even a hysterectomy to try and solve the problem did n't help - and her health was rapidly deteriorating			0
ms @entity0 said : ‘ by now i was even struggling to breathe			1
i needed an operation to expand my airways			0
‘ and each day i could barely get off the sofa			0
i just wanted to sleep and i was dosed up on so many painkillers			0
‘ i felt i was dying and panicked what would happen to my son , @entity106 , who was only 15 at the time			2
' the breakthrough moment came when she was having further tests one day			0
' the consultant mentioned i had high calcium levels and told me i needed to go back to my gp			1
' but when i got home , i researched my symptoms online - along with high calcium levels - and hyperparathyroidism came up			1
courtesy of @entity119 she said : ' i felt i was dying and panicked what would happen to my son , @entity106			0
‘ it was like i was trying to think through a fog			0
i ’d start sentences then could n’t find the word ' we all have four parathyroid glands - each the size of a grain of rice - in our neck , positioned behind the thyroid gland			2
they produce parathyroid hormone ( @entity134 ) to help control the levels of calcium , phosphorus and vitamin d within the bones and blood			2
but if these glands produce too much @entity134 , these levels could be sent haywire , causing blood calcium levels to rise and blood phosphorus levels to fall - and symptoms such as ms @entity0 's			1
the parathyroid glands are nothing to do with the thyroid gland			0
' @entity149 ' means ' near the thyroid '			0
parathyroid disorders should not be confused with an underactive thyroid or overactive thyroid			0
@entity154 does not always cause symptoms			0
when high levels of calcium do cause symptoms , they can be mild or general , including : depression , fatigue , feeling thirsty and passing a lot of urine nausea and loss of appetite muscle weakness , constipation , stomach ache , loss of concentration but , if left untreated , high blood levels of calcium can cause vomiting drowsiness dehydration , confusion , muscle spasms , bone pain or tenderness , irregular heart beat and high blood pressure in severe cases , high levels of calcium can lead to loss of consciousness and coma			1
source : @entity189 ‘ when i read all the symptoms , such as joint pain , bloating , confusion , weakness , fatigue , memory loss , high blood pressure , heart burn , increased thirst , i realised they matched mine			1
’ there are four tiny glands in the neck called the parathyroid glands , responsible for controlling calcium levels			1
in hyperparathyroidism , one or more of the glands malfunctions , producing too much paraythroid hormone			0
this results in raised calcium levels in the blood , depositing it in and around the organs and the brain - like cholesterol clogs the arteries			1
it also causes calcium to be leeched out of bones and can lead to heart attacks , kidney failure and strokes			0
shocked , ms @entity0 printed off her findings and took them to her gp - only to be proved right			1
a scan confirmed she had a small benign tumour on one of her parathyroid glands which had caused it to malfunction , causing the raised calcium levels in her blood			1
‘ all my symptoms had been caused by too much calcium			2
the first signs had been the pains in my arms and legs , where the calcium was being leeched out of my bones			0
‘ my brain fog must have been caused by calcium deposits in my brain			2
‘ my heart burn and huge stomach - calcium in my gut , and my breathing problems calcium in my sinuses			2
' in severe cases , high levels of calcium can lead to loss of consciousness and coma			1
ms @entity0 was told she would require surgery to remove the affected parathyroid gland			1
‘ in agony , i crawled into a hospital bed to undergo surgery			0
' i went into surgery feeling 95 , but after the operation i woke up feeling 35			1
in desperation , she turned to the internet - and just moments later found the answer that would change her life			0
the search results indicated she was suffering from a condition called hyperparathyroidism			1
she has now joined an online support group to try and raise awareness of the condition ‘ i felt amazing			1
with all my debilitating symptoms gone , it was like getting my life back			0
’ but as time went on , she became upset by the years she had lost to the illness			2
@entity0 , who now runs her own cleaning business , said : ' i lost seven years of my life and i may never have been cured if i had n’t diagnosed myself			2
' i do n’t think there ’s enough awareness of this debilitating and potentially life threatening condition '			0
she has now joined an online support group to try and raise awareness of hyperparathyroidism worldwide and offer advice			1
there is also concern that some patients are only offered surgery when their levels are very high			2
' but put people can suffer debilitating symptoms at a lower level as in my case , ' said ms @entity0			1
' as a group we ’re pressing to change regulations so that intervention occurs to take in lower level			0
' she has now written to medics across the @entity306 and is travelling around the @entity306 with an endocrinologist ( a doctor specialising in hormones ) to raise awareness of the condition			1
she said : ‘ i really believe there could be thousands of people out there who are suffering similar symptoms caused by hyperparathyroidism but have no idea they have this condition			1

@entity0 , now 47 , suffered for seven years before being diagnosed
had horrific bloating , excruciating joint pain and overwhelming tiredness
also suffered memory loss , confusion and felt thirst all the time
was eventually forced to give up work and rely on painkillers
then a doctor mentioned in passing she had high calcium levels in her blood
ms @entity0 went home and googled her symptoms , along with ' high calcium '
realised she was suffering from rare condition called hyperparathyroidism
this is caused by high levels of calcium - and is often *misdiagnosed*
@entity350 confirmed her diagnosis and she underwent surgery to remove gland
said : ' i went from feeling 95 to 35 immediately after the operation '
is now trying to raise awareness of the condition to help others *undiagnosed*
