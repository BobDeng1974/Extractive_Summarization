the headline on an easily - found and well put together @entity2 video in homage of @entity4 is : @entity5 , @entity6 , passes , tackles			1
the reality is that the video contains @entity11 's one @entity10 goal – admittedly a cracker away at @entity13 in october – and lots of clips of the other – rather more mundane – things that the @entity19 international was brought to @entity20 last summer to do			1
every team in the @entity22 needs a nuts - and - bolts man , of course			1
the simple things on a football need still need doing			2
@entity4 scoring his only goal ( so far ) for the club in the clash with @entity13 in october blind poses with his shirt after joining @entity10 , @entity32 and @entity33 are also present for some , though , what you do is not enough and when @entity4 sat down with @entity38 journalists on wednesday , he was asked about @entity40 's observation that : ' he plays far too many square passes and takes the easy option			1
' rather damning words from a former @entity10 captain and words that @entity4 admitted had not escaped his attention			1
' of course , i listen to him but i try to play my own game and does what the trainer wants from me and that is to keep possession , ' said @entity4			1
' there is always someone who wants to say something about the trainers or the teams otherwise there would be no interest in tv			2
' i can take a bit of criticism			2
the people on television can say what they want			2
you hear it but i think i have played some good games			2
blind was signed after impressing for @entity70 in the @entity71 and for @entity72 at the @entity73 ' of course you can sometimes play the ball forward but sometimes it is good to keep the ball in possession and make your team - mates play better			1
' i can make other players more important than myself			2
if i can do that by switching the play to the other side or wait for the right moment to do that then i will			2
' if there is space forward then i will play that ball but sometimes i think it is better to keep possession , to switch from side to side and move the ball and search for players who can make an individual action			0
i am not a player who does that			0
i like the possession game and keep the ball			0
' @entity40 has a well - deserved reputation as one of our better tv pundits			1
buried in @entity11 's observations , though , are words that one would expect to meet with his approval			2
when he says that ' i can make other players more important than myself ' , @entity11 would appear to be buying in not only to a philosophy that took @entity72 further than they expected to go in last summer 's @entity73 but was also fundamental to @entity10 's success during the years @entity40 played the game			1
blind clears the ball while under pressure from @entity118 's @entity117 forward @entity116 the former @entity70 man applauds the fans after @entity10 beat @entity118 in their @entity22 clash @entity4 , 24 , was brought to @entity10 by his former national coach @entity32 as a more than capable footballer but also as something of a messenger			1
after all when you are trying to change things round at a football club – trying to change people 's heads – then it 's handy to have a couple of people who already get it			1
so far , @entity11 has probably earned himself about a 7/10 rating at @entity20			0
not bad for a player who missed chunk of early winter with a serious knee injury			0
now that he is back and playing again , he expects @entity10 to make progress on the back of the principles that took an admittedly average @entity19 side to a @entity73 semi-final last july			1
' we did n't play very great football at the @entity73 but we were a team and we were winning games and we started playing better after winning , ' he recalled			0
the 24 - year - old challenges @entity152 midfielder @entity151 at old @entity20 blind warms up with team - mates @entity154 and @entity156 before the clash with @entity152 ' we improved			1
you change the system and you get better , you become a team and you start winning			0
' at @entity10 i do n't think the whole philosophy of the club has changed in the way we are playing			1
this is what the manager wants and i agree with it			0
' he is very clear in what he wants			0
we all understand what he wants			0
' the coach expects a lot from his players			0
he is very honest and direct in what he wants			0
that is a good thing			0
' he makes players better and he makes teams better			0
i like that in a coach			0
that is his most important asset			0
the versatile midfielder attempts to evade @entity118 midfielder @entity185 at @entity186 blind was criticised recently by former @entity10 captain @entity40 ' there are games we are doing things every well but games when we can do it better			1
' on friday night in @entity194 , @entity10 will face the latest examination of their claim to be an improving side			1
an @entity199 tie on a friday night against a @entity201 side should be enough to concern a team that has already lost 4 - 0 to @entity203 in the @entity204 and worked hard to win 2 - 0 at @entity205 in the last round of this competition			2
added to the fact that @entity210 's @entity22 record since his appointment is equivalent to his predecessor @entity212 and it is clear that @entity10 need to make tangible progress and quickly			1
' i know @entity10 have n't won the cup for 11 years and if you are in the race for a title or a cup then you want to be the champion , ' added @entity4			1
' whether it is the league or the cup you want to win it			0
' we knew it was going to be difficult in the @entity22 but we have to keep our heads up			0
we have to keep faith			0

@entity40 criticised @entity10 's @entity4
but @entity4 has hit back saying he believes he has been a success at @entity10
the 24 - year - old joined the club from @entity70 during the summer
@entity4 's only goal for @entity10 came against @entity13 in october
