by @entity0 and @entity1 a married @entity3 activist who was brought to court as one of @entity7 ’s alleged victims last night spoke of his astonishment that he had to give evidence about an incident that was simply a ‘ bit of a laugh ’			1
prosecutors claimed the former deputy speaker had tried to put his hand down the trousers of the party worker at a @entity19 conference more than ten years ago			1
but last night the 35 - year - old dismissed the alleged incident involving him as just a ‘ bit of drunken misbehaviour ’ that was ‘ not in any shape or form a crime ’			1
‘ i would definitely have not called myself a victim , ’ he said			0
‘ it was nothing more than some banter among friends			0
‘ it genuinely astonishes me that i was in court having to give evidence on something that was nothing more than a bit of a laugh and a joke			2
it is very , very surreal			0
’ after mr @entity7 was arrested for rape in may last year , the man said he did not contact police because he did not believe he was a victim of a criminal offence			1
but a @entity3 councillor who was also in the bar reported it to police			2
in his statement to police , the man wrote : ‘ i would like to categorically state i have no ill - feeling or malice to mr @entity7			1
i do not wish mr @entity7 to be charged as a result of what happened to me			1
‘ i am making this statement after a witness reported the incident			2
’ mr @entity7 was re-arrested and charged with indecent assault			1
of the seven alleged victims , three did not consider an offence had been committed against them			1
the man last night said he was ‘ relieved ’ that mr @entity7 had been cleared			1
the former deputy speaker of the @entity76 was cleared after a jury at @entity78 took less than six hours to acquit him of nine sex charges against seven men he said : ‘ do i think that he should spend even an hour of time in jail for what happened to me ? no. it never even occurred to me that it would be a police matter and would end up in court			0
‘ i made it clear to the police all along that i did not think he should be charged			0
‘ it does not surprised me in the slightest that he has been found not guilty			0
i think that is entirely right in the count involving me ’ he believes that mr @entity7 ’s reputation has been wrongly tarnished by the @entity39 bringing the case			1
he said : ‘ i feel sorry for @entity7			1
i think that unfortunately everyone is innocent until proven guilty unless you are a politician			0
‘ mps have got a fairly thick skin , but to have your sex life dragged up in public and be the subject of gossip is horrific			0
‘ unfortunately he had a job he loved and job he was good at as deputy speaker and it will be very hard for him to recover again			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity7 is someone who is genuinely well liked across the political divide			2
‘ he is seen as friendly , humorous and someone who is very good at his job			0
‘ maybe @entity7 had a bit of a problem with drink , but he is not predatory or a bad person by any stretch of the imagination			1
’ the man said he had seen mr @entity118 since 2003 , but they had never talked about the alleged incident			1
he said : ‘ we never talked about what happened because it was something in the past			0
on the few occasions i have spoken to him i ’ve got on perfectly well with him and we ’ve had a good gossip about party policy and things like that			0
i feel absolutely no animosity towards @entity7 whatsoever			2
‘ i hope that he rebuilds his life as best as he can now he has been cleared on all counts			0
i wish him all the best			0
i am sure the @entity39 will be reviewing the case			2
’ ' i would like to categorically state i have no ill - feeling or malice to mr @entity7			1
i do not wish mr @entity7 to be charged as a result of what happened to me ' - alleged victim in his police statement the court heard that the man had complained to mp @entity145 after he claimed a ‘ plastered ’ mr @entity7 had twice tried to put his hands down his trousers while drinking late at night			1
last night , the man said that he had only reported the event because he did not want mr @entity118 , who was at the time shadow spokesman for @entity151 , to be embarrassed in front of journalists who were also drinking in the bar and had wanted someone to send him to bed			2
he said : ‘ i was actually more embarrassed for him than i was for myself			0
when you have got a fairly senior mp who is acting in a drunken and foolish way , you do n’t want them to wake up the next day with their name all over the place when they have not been in control of things			2
’ the man said that although he had not wanted mr @entity118 to be prosecuted , he decided he should go to court and tell the truth about what happened .			0
