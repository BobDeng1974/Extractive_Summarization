health secretary @entity12 ( left ) will today announce that @entity13 ( right ) , who worked in @entity14 at @entity15 , is to be brought in as a senior adviser to ensure @entity5 staff can bring any concerns to light he argues that creating a culture of ‘ compassion , openness and transparency ’ across the @entity5 is vital to prevent a repeat of the scandal at @entity33 , in which as many as 1,200 patients died from neglect			1
between 2004 and 2008 , mrs @entity13 raised nearly 100 formal complaints about treatment of patients at @entity15 until , in frustration at being ignored by managers , she turned whistleblower			1
she became a key witness at the subsequent public inquiry which was damning of the neglect , indignity and shoddy care that was endured by patients			0
mrs @entity13 said : ‘ there has been much talk , but now is the time for action			2
‘ we must truly empower and support all @entity5 staff to raise concerns , and part of this is about ensuring they know how to do so and what to do if their concerns are ignored			1
‘ that ’s why i ’m delighted to be working on new mandatory training about whistleblowing , so that all staff will know what to do if they see care slip below the high standards we would all expect			1
’ the health secretary will also announce a plan to reduce ‘ avoidable harm ’ in the @entity5 by half over the next three years			1

he will confirm the introduction of a new ‘ duty of candour ’ – meaning that @entity5 organisations must notify the patient about incidents where ‘ significant harm ’ has occurred and provide an apology			2
‘ speaking out should never be confused with a lack of commitment to @entity5 values or “ running down the @entity5 ” , ’ he will say			2
‘ the highest form of commitment to our @entity5 is surely the courage to speak out against the system when the system gets it wrong			0
‘ we need to equip staff with the skills and confidence to speak up			0
‘ it is my ambition that the @entity5 should become the safest healthcare system anywhere in the world			0
‘ i want the tragic events of @entity33 to become a turning point in the creation of a more open , compassionate and transparent culture within the @entity5			0

@entity127 mp , chairman of the commons public accounts committee , said there was still a ‘ culture of fear ’ across the public sector against raising the alarm			0
she added that it was only thanks to a whistleblower that it emerged that private firm @entity136 was fiddling figures for its out - of - hours gp service in @entity139 , and yet the firm had ‘ rifled ’ through staff lockers to try to find the person who had leaked the information			0
@entity144 , a senior @entity145 official , said : ‘ we have a huge amount to do in getting into a position where staff feel confident that actions will be taken as a result of speaking up			0
