a @entity2 man born in 1890 - and still going strong - has been revealed as the oldest living person ever recorded , it was reported today			1
@entity4 turned 123 last month , according to @entity2 's civil registry			1
yet the herder , from the mountain village of @entity8 , 50 miles outside the capital @entity10 , is still healthy , walks without a stick and does n't wear glasses , according to reports			1
mr @entity4 , who lost his wife ten years ago , told @entity2 's @entity33 tv station that he believes the secret to a long life is taking daily long walks , and never eating pasta or sugar			1
instead , he said he has spent his life eating cananhua , a wild species of quinoa which is rich in protein and amino acid			2
history : the native @entity24 , who has three children , 16 grandchildren and 39 great - grandchildren , was 24 when @entity28 broke out and 62 when young @entity29 ascended to the throne home : @entity4 sits outside his home in the village of @entity50 , @entity2 @entity51 says the oldest living person verified by original proof of birth is @entity55 , a 115 - year - old @entity57 woman			1

i always shared the cooking with my wife			0
' we would only eat what we could find growing wild			0
we ate mostly skunk meat			0
i still go on long walks every day			2
' the @entity2 's biblical age means he would easily overtake the current oldest living person , 115 - year - old @entity57 woman @entity55			1
