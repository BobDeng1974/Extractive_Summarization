@entity0 could be used for communication within species while remaining camouflaged to predators researchers from the @entity5 used yellow filters on camera lenses to capture the light show , which is invisible humans findings of the study could lead to the discovery of new fluorescent proteins that could be used in biomedical research by @entity15 published : 14:01 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 14:06 est , 10 january 2014 fish come in many shapes and sizes and now scientists have identified more than 180 species that glow in a wide range of colours and patterns			1
while the strange light show is not visible to humans , the ways fish absorb light , transform it and eject it as a different colour , is common among many species and is used to communicate and attract a mate			1
the study , by the @entity5 is the first in - depth look at wide distribution of biofluorescence across fish that is invisible to the human eye			1

' we ’ve long known about biofluorescence underwater in organisms like corals , jellyfish , and even in land animals like butterflies and parrots , but fish biofluorescence has been reported in only a few research publications , ' said co-lead author @entity69 , a curator in the @entity5 ’s @entity70			2
researchers from the museum explained that fish live in a world that is predominantly blue because with depth , water quickly absorbs the majority of the visible light spectrum			2
in recent years they have discovered that many fish absorb the remaining blue light and re-emit it in neon greens , reds , and oranges			2

a sole ( c ) , flathead ( d ) , lizardfish ( e ) , sand stargazer ( k ) , chlopsidae ( l ) and gobiidae ( m ) are pictured ‘ by designing scientific lighting that mimics the ocean ’s light along with cameras that can capture the animals ’ fluorescent light , we can now catch a glimpse of this hidden biofluorescent universe , ’ said co-lead author @entity105 , an associate professor of biology at @entity107 and a research associate at the museum			1
‘ many shallow reef inhabitants and fish have the capabilities to detect fluorescent light and may be using biofluorescence in similar fashions to how animals use bioluminescence , such as to find mates and to camouflage , ’ he added			2
the researchers ’ investigations into fish biofluorescence began because they came across a show of green eel fluorescence off of @entity125 while imaging coral biofluorescence for a museum exhibit			0
to explore the phenomenon further , they were joined by scientists from three universities and photographers to capture images of fish in the waters of the @entity136 in the @entity137 and the @entity138			0
they dived by night and stimulated biofluorescence in the fish with high - intensity blue light arrays housed in watertight cases			0
the resulting underwater light show was invisible to the human eye			1

a glowing ray is pictured left to record the show , the researchers used underwater cameras with yellow filters , which block out the blue light			1
their expeditions revealed a zoo of biofluorescent fish from sharks and rays to bony eels , especially those that were patterned and well camouflaged living in coral reefs			0
the team discovered that many biofluorescent fish have yellow filters in their eyes , possibly allowing them to see the otherwise hidden fluorescent displays taking place in the water			1
although more research is needed , this finding indicates that biofluorescence could be used for interspecific communication while remaining camouflaged to predators			1
this ability might be especially important during full moons , when fish have been shown to partake in mating rituals			0
‘ the cryptically patterned gobies , flatfishes , eels , and scorpionfishes - these are animals that you ’d never normally see during a dive , ’ dr @entity183 said			0

a frogfish ( f ) , stonefish ( g ) , surgeonfish ( n ) and threadfin bream ( o ) are pictured ‘ to our eyes , they blend right into their environment			0
but to a fish that has a yellow intraocular filter , they must stick out like a sore thumb			0
’ further study on the mechanics of the glowing fish could uncover new florescent proteins for use in experimental biology			0
‘ the discovery of green fluorescent protein in a hydrozoan jellyfish in the 1960s has provided a revolutionary tool for modern biologists , transforming our study of everything from the @entity227 virus to the workings of the brain , ’ dr @entity105 said			2
‘ this study suggests that fish biofluorescence might be another rich reservoir of new fluorescent proteins , ’ he added .			1
