@entity0 recently posted a picture of himself on @entity2 sitting comfortably on a cloud high up in the sky overlooking the @entity6 landscape			1
@entity7 are familiar with forwards possessing lofty opinions of themselves , but in the dying seconds of their @entity11 encounter at @entity12 , @entity0 delivered a goal to match his high self - esteem			1
in fairness to him , the cloud shot was posted more in praise of @entity20 ’s capital than anything but it raised a smile nonetheless			0
someone had been busy on @entity24			0
@entity0 ( front right ) is embraced by @entity26 after scoring @entity7 's winner at @entity12 @entity0 celebrates his goal after coming on just six minutes prior in place of @entity30 @entity0 posted this image on social media in tribute to his two and a half years of living and playing in @entity6 while he still has plenty of doubters , @entity0 thanks those who have been behind him all the way ‘ for 2.5 years now i 've lived & played in @entity6 , i like this great @entity41 , ’ @entity0 wrote to accompany the image , including hashtags ‘ londonisred ’ and ‘ thebigsmoke ’			1
if only this reporter could come up with a pun like that last one			0
the point is that while @entity0 has been frozen out to a large degree by @entity47 , he remains a cult hero to many @entity7 fans who like his breezy manner and humorous tone on social media			1
he has posted more than 3,100 tweets to his 2.23million followers			0
to date , he shows off 708 smiling , stylised pictures on @entity56 , where he has almost 1.8m subscribers			0
on and off the pitch , @entity0 is ever - ready to pose either solo or with a team - mate such as @entity61 @entity0 with hat - trick hero @entity62 ( left ) after their @entity63 win and @entity65 at a charity event ‘ if only he could be as productive on the football pitch , ’ @entity47 might well scorn			1
that added - time goal in @entity69 , six minutes after coming on , was his first of the season for @entity7 on his sixth appearance			1
he has however only had 145 minutes combined throughout this campaign			1
@entity47 simply does n’t trust a man with 120 international caps to his name to do the business over 90 minutes , to offer work - rate with his supreme striking ability			2
@entity0 slots the 90th - minute goal that handed the @entity81 a vital victory over @entity12 in @entity83 @entity7 places are elated after @entity0 ( right with @entity61 jumping on his back ) scores in @entity69 the @entity88 striker was pumped for the @entity12 clash and got his chance to be the hero late in the piece make no mistake , his goal against @entity12 was huge			1
had @entity7 drawn that match , their hopes of progressing to the knock - out phase of the @entity11 for a 15th consecutive season would have been in doubt			1
it was a match they should really have lost on balance of chances			0
instead , they are in position to qualify from @entity107 behind @entity108			0
for that @entity47 should be grateful to the player he signed for £ 10.9m from @entity111 in 2012			2
speaking this month after winning his latest cap for @entity113 in the 1 - 1 draw with the @entity115 , @entity0 said : ‘ i have assessed my position in the team , and it has to change now			1
let ’s see what happens in the winter			0
the fact is that i 'm not happy with it , that 's clear			0
’ @entity0 poses with his beloved dog @entity123 and with his two grandmothers holding his @entity127 medal @entity0 posts another photoshopped gem ahead of their 1 - 1 draw with @entity131 on september 27 almost ever since that day though it has seemed likely @entity0 will leave			1
still only 29 , he wants more playing time than he is receiving , quite understandably			0
a january transfer is not out of the question			0
@entity7 fans who have taken him to heart would be sad to see him go			1
his goal against @entity12 may alter that eventuality			1
what is for certain , he will not be heading to @entity131			0
‘ @entity140 would freeze over before this transfer would happen # @entity0 # aha # @entity142 # @entity143 # afc # @entity144			2
’ more hashes than welcome in a full @entity20 breakfast , and more reason for @entity7 supporters to hold him in special regard			2
