by @entity0 the £ 50million @entity2 mansion already boasted ‘ a masterful opulence once only reserved for nobility ’ — or so the estate agents ’ blurb went when she bought it			1
but , clearly , this was still not quite grand enough for @entity9 , the 25 - year - old daughter of @entity11 mogul @entity10			1
so having bought it , she was keen to impose her own unique taste on the 56,000 sq ft property and turn it into her own little palace as quickly as possible			1
it reportedly stretches all the way from twin 5ft sculptures of @entity29 in a bikini , to the @entity32 portraits , including work by @entity34 , which mr @entity35 collects and which line the hallway			0
the 123 - room house , claimed to rival the @entity40 in size and built in 1991 in the style of a @entity44 chateau , belonged to the late @entity46 film and television producer @entity47 , the creator of @entity48 and @entity49 , and his wife @entity50			2
@entity51 bought it for £ 50 million in 2011			2
soon after she began the startling make - over , which took just 12 weeks — three weeks to plan and nine to install , involving an army of 500 workers and costing £ 15 million			1
she has now put it on the market for £ 88 million so stands to make an eye - watering £ 23 million profit — if she can find a buyer			2
@entity9 , the 25 - year - old daughter of @entity11 mogul @entity10 , bought the home in 2011 out went the chintz and more traditional trappings of the previous owners and in came a new look that is undeniably dramatic , some might even say jaw - dropping ... or , dare one even suggest , just a little bit showy ? from the white marble floor with bold black stripes of the hallway , through the cavernous his and hers closets where @entity51 and her businessman husband @entity35 keep rack upon rack of designer clothes and cabinets crammed with top - end watches , to the three deep - buttoned gold hairdressing stations and two ‘ mani - pedi ’ chairs - so @entity51 and friends can have a manicure and pedicure after having their hair coiffed - in the beauty salon bedecked with pictures of @entity88 , little could be called understated			1
there are brown hues in some parts of the mansion , and @entity51 has described the look as ‘ very dark and kind of sexy with a boudoir feel ’			0
the sprawling house also features a specially designed dog pampering room and a ‘ nightclub ’ in the basement complete with bowling alley and pool room			1
set in five acres , it has space for at least 100 cars — handy if you ’re having a few friends round , presumably — and has an outdoor swimming pool and tennis court			0
@entity51 married mr @entity35 in a £ 12million ceremony at @entity111 near @entity112 in 2011			2
she gave birth to the couple ’s first child , @entity114 , in february last year			0
in a recent interview with @entity117 about her remodelling of the house , @entity51 said : ‘ i know the house is huge , but with the other houses we looked at that were a similar size to this , you felt like you were in a museum			0
they did n’t feel homely			0
i think because there was a family here previously it was warmer and cosier			0

the 25 - year - old daughter of *motorsport* magnate @entity10 bought opulent home for £ 50million

after she bought it in 2011 , a £ *15million* *overhaul* took 500 workers nine weeks to complete
