by @entity0 this is the moment a @entity3 woman who witnessed 9/11 broke down when she saw her description of how people had to jump from the @entity6 had been adopted by the new museum dedicated to victims			1
@entity9 , 47 , was living in @entity10 in 2001 and refused to turn away as the two hijacked jets destroyed the @entity6 , killing almost 3,000 people			1
miss @entity13 , who now lives in @entity15 , decided to return to the city to visit the newly - opened @entity17 and found a powerful quote she gave is etched into its wall			1
the inscription reads : ' you felt compelled to watch out of respect to them			1
' they were ending their life without a choice and to turn away from them would have been wrong			1
' miss @entity13 , who lived and worked just two blocks away from the @entity6 , said : ' it means so much to know i have helped preserve their memory and honour them			1
' i did n't know the quote was going to be there and to see it carved into the wall was a sad and emotional moment			0
' i felt strongly that they not should be forgotten or ignored			2
' watching them was horrific and that part of the day has taken me the longest to come to terms with			0
' ordeal : miss @entity13 said : ' they were ending their life without a choice and to turn away from them would have been wrong ' as she watched people jump from the @entity6 she also left a vivid 10,000 - word audio account of her experiences - and without her knowledge the inscription is taken from that			1
a purple pair of flip - flops she wore on the day , which had a piece of one of the towers embedded in them , is also part of a museum display			1
the devastating attacks - along with the crashing of two more aircraft , into the @entity78 , in @entity79 , and a field in @entity81 - killed nearly 3,000 people			2
more than 1,100 people have never been identified , and their remains have been placed in a tomb under the new museum			2
at the time @entity87 was part of a production team working on the @entity92 programme with the @entity93 ( @entity93 )			2
never forget : president @entity94 dedicated the new museum last week			2
pictured above looking a pictures of the dead with former @entity10 mayor @entity97 emotional : the impressive museum features ladder three @entity99 as well as scores of other items from 9/11 she was engulfed by dust and debris as the shattered towers crashed to the ground			1
the new museum , which features thousands of artefacts from the atrocity , opened this month			2
miss @entity13 , who runs a public relations and communications consultancy , was invited to view it before it opened to the public			0
' in the beginning there were lots of tears but the museum was so respectful and honest about 9/11 , ' she said			1
the trip was made possible thanks to her friends , who wrote to @entity124 asking for help with the cost of the flights			0
no day shall erase you from the memory of time : the letters of the quotation from @entity133 were forged out of remnant @entity6 steel by @entity136 blacksmith @entity135 the airline generously slashed the cost while her friends also helped her out			1
' i 'm so , so grateful to the friends who clubbed together for me to go there			0
' i 'm so glad i got to go during the dedication period as i do n't think i could go and stand next to tourists whose experience would be very different to mine , ' said @entity9			1
' i went to the toilet at one point and that seemed to be where people went to cry and hug in private , away from the main public spaces			0
' there was a mutual respect between everybody when we looked at each other because we had all had that experience			2
' in honor of the first responders : captain @entity162 's helmet from the @entity163 on display in the museum - but some critics have turned on management for ' crass ' decisions made about a gift shop and new restaurant the 9/11 museum has faced major criticism since it opened last week			1
most recently it was accused of crass commercialism after it was revealed that the memorial site will house a 80 - seat restaurant			0
the @entity177 , run by @entity179 mastermind @entity178 , is scheduled to open inside the @entity17 during the summer			0
a portion of proceeds from the restaurant are going back to the museum but mr @entity178 has was forced to deny the location was inappropriate			0
according to reports , some first responders , who were supposed to be able to tour the museum for free prior to its official wednesday opening , were turned away due to party preparations			0
' they were drinking , eating and laughing when this is pretty much a grave - site , ' a @entity17 employee , who asked not to be named , told the @entity193 of the 60 or so partygoers			0
there has also been outrage from september 11 survivors and victims ' families over a gift shop attached to the @entity17			0
the store associated with the museum sells items ranging from key chains to @entity206 dog vests marketed off the tragedy			0
jewellery , mousepads , magnets , flags , pins , stuffed animals , cellphone cases , toy firetrucks and much more are available for purchase			0
according to the museum 's website , the proceeds benefit ' developing and sustaining ' the memorial which is run by executives with privately - funded six - figure salaries			1
the idea of a gift shop alone is offensive to many , but is made even more painful considering thousands of unidentified remains of victims were recently moved to a tomb beneath the museum			1
' here is essentially our tomb of the unknown			0
to sell baubles i find quite shocking and repugnant , ' @entity233 , who lost her 26 - year - old son @entity234 in the attacks , told the @entity238 .			0

@entity9 *sobbed* when she realised her words had been adopted
she had refused to turn away as victims jumped from the @entity6
' you felt compelled to watch out of respect to them ' , she said at the time
her words , and flip - flops containing a piece of debris , now in 9/11 museum
