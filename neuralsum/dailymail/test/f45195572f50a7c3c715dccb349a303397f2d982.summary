the stage was set for the coronation of @entity2 on tuesday but @entity3 stubbornly refused to hurry him to his throne			2
the perfect script for this first test saw @entity8 taking the four wickets he needed to become the most prolific bowler in @entity12 ’s history in his 100th game with record holder sir @entity14 here and waiting to crown his successor			1
but @entity3 made @entity8 wait on an attritional day that was in sharp contrast to the excitement provided by the first of this crucial series			1
certainly @entity8 would not have expected to play a more significant role with bat than ball on the second day of this first test as @entity3 did much to make up for their profligacy in the last two sessions of the first			1
when @entity8 , watched by his wife , two daughters and parents , strode out to bat @entity12 had lost five wickets for 20 runs and were in danger of wasting the initiative handed to them largely by @entity38 ’s century			1
but ‘ the @entity40 ’ , of course , is a more than useful @entity41 these days and came within 19 runs of a test century at @entity43 last year , so it should not have been a surprise to see him sticking around with @entity46			2
when the pair were separated after a last - wicket stand of 38 @entity12 had moved to within a run of the score of 400 that should have been their minimum target when they were well placed on 341 for four on the first evening			2
then it was a question of whether this unassuming @entity54 could move from 380 wickets to 384 and overtake @entity14 , who was on hand apparently with a nice bottle of red wine waiting to celebrate , at the top of @entity12 ’s @entity7 tree			1
only it was not quite as simple as that			0
modern test pitches in the @entity64 are notoriously slow and turgid and it was never going to be a case of simply sitting back and waiting for a @entity68 collapse			0
@entity8 ( right ) is still three wickets away from breaking sir @entity14 's @entity12 record @entity71 was @entity12 's first man to be dismissed on day two when he edged to @entity72 in the slips @entity74 celebrates dismissing @entity75 to take @entity3 ' first wicket of the day in @entity77 @entity78 edges a delivery from @entity72 behind as he is dismissed for eight @entity8 had surprisingly chosen to bowl from the @entity81 where the strong cross-wind that blows across this ground would in theory assist in - swing more than his more dangerous out - swinger			1
but @entity8 , who had led @entity12 out on to the field in his landmark @entity7 , generally knows what he is doing and successfully targeted the outside edge of the left - handed @entity91 ’s bat with a beauty			2
it was to prove his only success of a frustrating day			0
@entity8 could make no further inroads and was surprisingly limited to just four overs after tea as the other @entity12 bowlers were forced to share the load and three more wickets			1
@entity46 had looked good in making an unbeaten 21 and now he was to again prove himself an all - round cricketer of rich but raw promise , taking the wicket of @entity104 and later claiming an outstanding diving slip catch off @entity78 to send back his old @entity107 schoolmate @entity106			2
@entity108 , who has not been at his best since returning from injury at the @entity110 , had earlier ended @entity111 hopes of extending his purple patch against @entity12 and @entity3 were on the back foot at 99 for four			1
@entity114 fell for a duck despite facing 22 deliveries on the second morning at the sir @entity117 @entity3 fast bowler celebrates after dismissing @entity114 for a duck on day two of the first test @entity108 was @entity12 's ninth wicket to fall before @entity8 fell for 20 with the score on 399 @entity8 celebrates after seeing @entity91 edge behind to @entity114 to take @entity12 's first wicket @entity114 makes the catch from @entity8 's bowling to dismiss @entity91 for 11 and leave @entity3 19 for one yet the evergreen @entity128 , who could easily have gone to his first ball , settled in to his old idiosyncratic routine and hung on to the close with the far less secure @entity132 , who had a major escape when @entity71 had him well caught at slip only to be denied because he had over-stepped			1
@entity71 has previous in this regard , having been denied his maiden @entity7 wicket in @entity137 when he snared @entity138 only to overstep again and there is simply no excuse to lose a wicket in this way			0
the @entity144 hot - head was clearly ticking afterwards and it can only be hoped that he did not encounter any lockers when he returned to the dressing room , having broken his wrist punching one in @entity107 last year			0
@entity3 finished on 155 for four having had the better of the second day and leaving @entity12 with much to do if they are to secure the win here that would be so important to them			1
@entity3 were batting earlier than expected because of a poor performance from @entity12 in the morning as they replicated their struggles of the first session of the match and crumbled against good pace bowling			2
@entity46 celebrates after dismissing @entity104 , who edged behind to @entity114 , for 10 @entity108 celebrates dismissing @entity111 for 33 to leave @entity3 on 89 for three @entity78 celebrates after seeing @entity158 hold onto a catch at first slip to dismiss @entity106 @entity71 was perfectly placed to score his second test hundred but once he had steered @entity74 straight to gully @entity12 worryingly had no answer to what remains a more than useful @entity3 pace trio			1
most disturbing of all was the performance of @entity108 , who was once a good enough batsman to score a test hundred at @entity167 against @entity168			0
now he looks a shadow of a player once thought of as a potential no 7 for @entity12 and again looked like he had been affected by being hit in the face by @entity173 ’s @entity172 at @entity174 last summer			0
@entity108 was honest enough to admit during the @entity110 that he had had nightmares about the incident that left his nose broken but he was also confident that he was getting back to his best with the bat			0
it did not seem that way here as he ducked a couple of short balls from @entity184 and then , caught on the back foot , slapped a fuller ball to gully			0
when he fell and @entity12 had slumped to 361 for nine the @entity7 was back in the balance but @entity8 and @entity46 kept @entity12 ’s noses in front until the wait for @entity8 ’s big moment began			1
we are all still waiting			0
@entity12 , meanwhile , should confirm on wednesday that @entity193 will join the squad in time for the second test in @entity196 after successfully coming through his return after injury with @entity199			0
it could mean that @entity201 , disappointing in the warm - up in @entity203 , is released to return to @entity204 , who have been frustrated by the sight of four of their players being in the @entity12 party but not included in this first test .			0
