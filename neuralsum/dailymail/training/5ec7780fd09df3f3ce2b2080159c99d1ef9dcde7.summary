‘ the clinical consequences of these longer waiting times and a lower quality service to patients with conditions such as heart disease , liver disease , leukaemia , complex cancers etc will be severe			1
‘ there will inevitably be a significant number of patients suffering unnecessarily , for example by needing more extensive surgery due to their cancer progressing during the wait			0
