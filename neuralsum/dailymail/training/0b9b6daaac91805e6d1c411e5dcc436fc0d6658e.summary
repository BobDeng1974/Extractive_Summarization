@entity1 governments are accused of becoming one of @entity4 's biggest donors because of the huge ransoms they pay for hostages			1
the terror group and its affiliates netted an alleged £ 73million in just six years from the payments - which are cloaked in secrecy and denied by the governments accused of making them			0
leading the way was @entity14 which paid a record £ 24million for four hostages who were freed in october last year , according to a major investigation by @entity17			1
toll : @entity14 has been accused of paying £ 24million for the release of @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , pictured with president @entity24 in october when they were freed after three years in @entity26 @entity27 : @entity21 , one of the four @entity14 hostages , during their three - year ordeal			1
a @entity17 investigation reveals how governments mainly in @entity1 have bankrolled @entity4 to the tune of £ 73million flow of terror funds : @entity35 , @entity14 , @entity36 and @entity37 are accused of paying ransoms to @entity39 in northern africa , including @entity41			1
@entity42 and @entity43 are accused of paying ransoms to @entity44 ( right ) while the source of another £ 13m of ransom money is unaccounted for the leader of @entity44 has even described kidnappings as ' an easy spoil ' giving swift income to his terror network			1
' thanks to @entity55 , most of the battle costs , if not all , were paid from through the spoils , ' the newspaper quoted him as saying			0
' kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil , which i may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure			0
' the most prominent case - involving by far the most money - was that of four @entity14 nuclear firm employees who stunned the world when they were returned unharmed after three years in captivity			2
@entity21 , @entity23 , @entity22 and @entity20 were captured in september 2010 while working on a uranium mine in northern @entity26			0
their touchdown at a military airport near @entity72 in october , where they were met by president @entity24 , prompted world headlines amid claims a heavy price had been paid			2
difficult choices : the @entity79 insists it does not negotiate with terrorists , but there can be heavy consequences			2
this video released in 2004 shows @entity79 hostage @entity84 before he was beheaded by militants victim : @entity88 , a @entity79 contractor working in @entity90 , was also beheaded by kidnappers in 2004 who said they were part of the @entity4 - allied group @entity95			1
scores of westerners have been abducted the @entity14 government insisted it used diplomacy to free the four men , with defence minister @entity101 saying : ‘ @entity14 has held the same position for the past three years - we do n’t pay			0
' but the @entity14 newspaper @entity103 , renowned for its secret service contacts , reported the country 's intelligence agencies paid 20million euros ( £ 17m ) for their release			2
today 's investigation puts this figure far higher - at 30million euros ( £ 24m ) which it is claimed was paid by a state - owned company			2
@entity14 £ 34m @entity42 and oman £ 12m @entity35 £ 7.3m @entity37 £ 6.5m @entity36 £ 1.9m source not known £ 13m the @entity17 also claims @entity14 paid @entity4 12.5million euros ( £ 10m ) in 2011 to free three hostages from @entity14 , @entity114 and @entity115			1
the total - £ 34million - means @entity14 's payments were almost triple those of the next - highest payer , @entity42 and @entity43 ( £ 12m )			2
@entity35 also paid £ 7.3m , @entity37 paid £ 6.5m and @entity36 paid £ 1.9m , while the source of another £ 13m in ransom money could not be determined			1
reporter @entity121 collated the figures by interviewing former hostages , negotiators , diplomats and government sources in 10 countries			0
the reporter also uncovered thousands of pages of internal @entity4 documents which lay out the terror network 's approach to kidnapping westerners			0
they chime with repeated warnings by the @entity79 government that ransoms are now terrorism 's second - biggest source of income			1
@entity140 , @entity141 under - secretary for terrorism , claimed @entity4 was not the only group profiting - others include @entity145 in @entity146 and @entity147 in @entity148 , @entity146 and @entity149			1
warnings : @entity140 , pictured left on @entity152 with under - secretary for @entity155 @entity153 , warned ransoms were now the second - biggest income stream for terrorists including @entity145 joy at a price : @entity22 , one of the four @entity14 hostages , celebrates with his family last october in a speech last month he said there had been a decline in wealthy donors bankrolling terror groups so they were relying on kidnappings instead			1
' aside from state sponsorship of terrorism , ransom payments are the greatest source of terrorist funding today , ' he warned			0
' groups such as @entity44 , @entity39 , @entity145 , and @entity147 have collected tens of millions of dollars in ransoms in the past several years			1
' these ransom payments are used to fuel the whole cycle of terrorist activities , including inflicting indiscriminate harm			0
' improving the international effort against kidnapping - for - ransom is an urgent challenge			0
' the @entity79 insists neither the @entity182 nor @entity183 have paid terrorists			2
but despite the claim , the amount @entity4 can charge for ransoms has allegedly soared to £ 6million a head			0
it even ' outsources ' its operations to criminal gangs who take a cut from the ransom when it is paid			0
in one case , @entity4 offered to free a @entity183 hostage who was captured in @entity198 in 2011 - if @entity183 agreed to release the radical preacher @entity199 into an ' @entity201 ' country .			0

@entity17 investigation claims @entity1 nations are main *culprits*
@entity14 said to have paid £ 24million for four hostages freed in october
@entity79 warns ransoms are now terrorists ' second - biggest income source
militants from @entity145 and @entity147 have also raked in millions
