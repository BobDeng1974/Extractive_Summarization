@entity6 , who has battled four different types of cancer , with her daughter @entity14			1
she says @entity14 keeps her strong and positive then , it seems , her luck ran out			2
the disease has since struck three more times , in her left eye , her bladder and a kidney , and on her right foot			1
now aged 30 , miss @entity6 has had more than 20 operations or minor procedures to identify and remove malignant growths			1

after a difficult pregnancy , her daughter @entity14 was born at 29 weeks			0
in 2008 miss @entity6 ’s bad luck returned			1
she suffered a migraine that lasted for several days , and specialists eventually said there was a tumour behind her left eye			1
they were unable to diagnose the type of cancer and a biopsy was ruled out because of the risk of losing the eye , so they opted to monitor its growth instead			1
the following year , miss @entity6 was diagnosed with cancer for the third time , in her bladder and left kidney			1
she had surgery to remove the tumours from her bladder , and to remove the kidney completely			1
this july , the disease struck again			0
miss @entity6 noticed a lump on her right foot , which was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma , a form of skin cancer , and removed			1
doctors now think it might be connected to the cancer behind her eye , which they believe is a melanoma			2
on monday , she will begin another course of chemotherapy to shrink it			0
she has also been referred to a genetic counsellor , who will discuss her case and see if her daughter has a heightened risk of developing cancer			2
@entity91 affects around 100 children a year in the @entity25			0
about half have the high - risk form and their chances of survival are 40 per cent , much better than 30 years ago			2
but a recent study found that survivors had a significantly greater risk of developing a second cancer later in life .			2

@entity6 has had lung cancer , eye cancer and bladder and kidney cancer . she has just been diagnosed with skin cancer
she was given a 10 per cent chance of living past the age of five after a tumour was found in her lung but beat the odds and went on to have child
