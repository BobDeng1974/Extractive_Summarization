however , finally there is one with a difference - it 's hosted in space			2
@entity11 astronaut @entity10 today posted the first episode of his new show , called ' @entity10 's @entity14 ' - although the first recipe , a tortilla filled with honey and peanut butter , may not be to everyone 's taste			1
here , he collects everything for a honey and peanut butter tortilla keep your eye on the prize : at one point @entity10 's torilla spins off screen and has to be retrieved , showing the issues of preparing food in zero gravity ' in the early days of space exploration , food was mostly squeezed out of tubes , ' said @entity10 in the video			1
' but now , we have all kinds of things we eat on @entity47			0
' however , he reveals there are some banned foods - including sandwiches			2
' for sandwiches , we substituted bread for tortillas - here , crumbs just float away , ' he explained			2
' our tortillas are packaged and last for 18 months			0
' @entity10 shows viewers how to make a tortilla filled with peanut butter and honey			1
he reveals that some items , such as honey jars , can be attached to surfaces using velcro to stop them floating away			1
however , others can also cause problems - as he demonstrates when a rogue tortilla floats away from him during the demonstration			1
honey jars are attached using velcro to stop them floating away when not in use keeping utensils in check is accomplished using clips and velcro			1
here , @entity10 reaches for his ' space scissors ' to cut open a pack of peanut butter during the demonstration he also reveals an interesting fact about honey on board			1
' the bubbles stay in the middle of the bottle , as there 's no gravity ' , he explains			0
he also reveals that when eating food such as peanut butter and honey , astronauts can easily get messy			1
however , as there is no running water on board , they have to use disposable wipes to clean themselves up after each meal			0
the video is the latest in a long line of online picture , messages and videos from @entity103 , who has been taking advantage of the station 's internet connection to share his mission via @entity109 and @entity111 pages			0
he is expected to post more episodes of his fledgling space cookery show			0
bread is banned on board because of the risk of wayward crumbs - so astronauts use tortillas instead instead of washing their hands , astronauts instead use specially packaged wipes on board , which are then thrown away @entity125 recently revealed what astronauts have eaten throughout its space programme			1
they showed the transition from the meat paste @entity131 , the first man in space , sucked from a toothpaste tube to the gourmet meals astronauts currently enjoy			0
the pictures were posted on the space agency 's website by @entity125 's @entity138 , where the agency researches , tests , and produces food fit for consumption outside of the @entity47 's atmosphere			0
stellar cuisine : @entity125 have released photos chronicling the evolution of the food eaten in space			0
pictured is a tray of food eaten on the @entity152 , @entity154 's first space station , from 1973 - 1974 appetizing : food from the @entity157 missions from 1968 - 1972 was carefully vacuum - packed and balanced for nutrition but was not exactly gourmet			2
