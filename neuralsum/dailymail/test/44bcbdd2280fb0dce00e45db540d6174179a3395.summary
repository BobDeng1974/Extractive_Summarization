@entity0 is determined to ensure the return of a long - standing ritual at @entity3 is not a one - off this season			1
fresh from @entity3 's first victory in 35 grands prix in @entity8 11 days ago , and ending his own 20 - race drought , @entity0 returned to a hero 's welcome at the team 's factory at @entity15 last week			1
the win allowed @entity3 to revive a tradition not seen at their base for almost two years since their previous triumph in may 2013 at the @entity23 @entity22 courtesy of @entity24			1
@entity0 reflected on his stunning win for @entity3 at the @entity8 @entity22 during the press conference before the weekend 's @entity27 in @entity28 the four - time world champion shares a friendly discussion with @entity32 star @entity31 four - times world champion @entity0 said : ' it was a great victory we had in @entity8 , great for us as a team , and for myself a very emotional day - my first win with @entity3			1
' when i returned to the factory on wednesday , to see all the people there was quite special			0
there are a lot of people working there and as you can imagine they were very , very happy			0
' the team had n't won for quite a while , so they enjoyed the fact they had something to celebrate			0
there were a couple of rituals involved , so it was nice for them to get that feeling again			0
' asked as to the specific nature of the rituals , @entity0 replied : ' i was supposed to be there for simulator work anyway , but it was quite nice to receive the welcome after the win			2
@entity3 's @entity0 and @entity64 arrive at the @entity28 circuit along with a @entity3 mechanic , @entity0 caught up with members of his old team @entity68 on thursday ' all the factory got together for a quick lunch			1
it was quite nice to have all the people together in one room - it was a big room ! - so we were able to celebrate altogether for a bit			0
' i also learned when you win with @entity3 , at the entry gate , they raise a @entity3 flag - and obviously it 's been a long time since they last did that			1
' some 10 years ago there were a lot of flags , especially at the end of a season , so this flag will stay there for the rest of the year			0
' we will , of course , try and put up another one sometime soon			0
' inside the @entity3 garage , @entity0 shares a discussion with team staff as he looks to build on his @entity94 win @entity3 team principal @entity95 shares a conversation with @entity0 at the team 's hospitality suite the feeling is that will not happen after this weekend 's race in @entity102 as the conditions at the @entity104 are expected to suit rivals @entity105			1
not that @entity0 believes his success will be a one - off , adding : ' for here and the next races , we should be able to confirm we have a strong package and a strong car			2
' we will want to make sure we stay ahead of the people we were ahead of in the first couple of races , but obviously knowing @entity105 are in a very , very strong position			2
' in general , for the start of a season things can be up and down , and we want to make sure there is quite a lot of ups , not so many downs			0
' but it 's normal in some races you are more competitive than others			0
' we managed to do a very good job in @entity8 , but for here and the next races we have to be realistic about we want to achieve			2
' @entity3 mechanics show their joy after @entity0 won the @entity8 @entity22 , helping record the team 's first @entity133 win since 2013 at the @entity23 @entity22			1

@entity0 stunned rivals @entity105 to win @entity8 @entity22
