by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 's friends may only have been joking when they labelled him a one - hit wonder , but the 29 - year - old will take the perfect riposte back to @entity7 - the @entity9 trophy			1
@entity3 's first major title in the 2010 @entity11 came as a shock to the 25 - year - old , who was equally unprepared to cope with becoming world number one six months later			1
a fourth consecutive missed cut at the @entity15 contributed to his spell as number one lasting just eight weeks , but also prompted changes to his swing to cope with the demands of @entity23 , where a draw is more useful than @entity3 's favoured fade			1
pride : @entity3 celebrates winning the @entity9 in @entity27 of sunday what followed was hardly a dramatic slump , with a first @entity31 event won with a closing 63 in @entity32 later that year , but @entity3 did not win a full - field event in 2012 or 2013			1
by the time of his heroics at @entity36 in september 2012 , @entity3 admitted he would not have picked himself for the @entity38 team , but having qualified he had little choice and played just once before his starring role in sunday 's decisive singles			1
and just five weeks before his stunning win at @entity43 , @entity3 entered the @entity44 ranked 61st in the world , only to card a course record - equalling 63 in the first round on his way to a wire - to - wire victory			1
belief : @entity3 believed his big moment would come after a difficult time on the course ' it should n't sound cocky or arrogant , but i knew it would come , ' @entity3 said			1
' i knew that i would play good golf again			0
there was enough belief there			0
i just did n't think it would take me that much time to get back where i was , or actually not where i was , i think i play better golf now , i 'm more of a complete player			2
' it was just a matter of time so it 's not a huge surprise to me that i played good golf , it 's just a surprise that i won such big tournaments			1
but i 'll take it			0
' @entity3 has packed a lot into his career already , shooting a round of 59 on the @entity74 in @entity7 , holing the putt to ensure @entity76 retained the @entity38 at @entity36 and becoming @entity76 number one in 2010			1
and he has now joined @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 as the only men to win two majors and reach world number one before the age of 30			2
' it 's very tough to compare yourself to those legends , ' @entity3 added			1
' when other people want to call me that it 's fine , but to win one major is already very nice in your career , but to win two , it means a lot more			1
jubilant : @entity3 ( left ) gets sprayed with water by @entity99 women 's professional golfer @entity97 ' some friends called me a one - hit wonder with the majors , obviously in a funny way , and now i can go back and show them this trophy			1
my next tournament ( the @entity105 ) will be in @entity106 , where i live , so i will make sure to take that trophy with me			2
' it 's quite a big proof to yourself that you can not only win once , but you can win when it matters , you can win big tournaments			2
and i 'm only 29 years old , so i hope i have another few years ahead of me			0
' with @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity80 all winning majors in their 40s recently that is certainly true , and @entity3 should be better equipped to handle the attention second time around			1
' four years ago i did n't know what 's happening , ' he added			0
i was not expecting myself to win a major at 25			2
i was surprised about my performance			0
i was surprised about a lot of things			0
form : @entity3 hits from the fairway on the 14th hole during the third round of the @entity9 ' i could n't handle a lot of things that happened in @entity7 , all the attention that i could get			1
and then becoming number one in the world , that added another thing and it was too much			0
to be completely honest , it was very difficult to handle everything and to play good golf			0
' the swing improvements was one thing			0
i knew that i would struggle a little bit for a while , that i wo n't be in contention every week			0
but getting so much attention and then all of a sudden , you do n't win again			2
so why is that ? so why do you change ? you have to answer all of those questions , and you do n't want to answer those questions all the time			0
' you answer them once or twice and then that should be enough			0
but people keep going and i keep answering and answering			0
why do you change if you win a major , you become number one in the world ? and it 's annoying			2
' i do n't want to be rude to people , so that 's why i kept answering			0
but i want to say that 's enough			0
i think we talked about it many times before and now i 'm sitting here with the @entity9			2
' well done : @entity159 ( left ) congratulates @entity3 ( r ) on his eight - stroke victory			1

@entity3 claims second major title win with @entity9 victory
@entity7 claims winning a big tournament was a ' matter of time '
