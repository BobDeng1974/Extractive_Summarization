@entity1 , 11 , has been refused the free pass even though police say it is unsafe for him to walk to school			1

' this section is one in which we deal with a number of anti-social problems including cars being burnt out , drug misuse , motor cycle annoyance and assaults			1
' during the winter months children would have to walk along the forest path in darkness at times when there are not many people around			2
' @entity53 , of @entity54 , @entity55 , lives too close to @entity56 to qualify for the school bus			0
@entity58 said children qualified for free transport if they live more than three miles along an available walking route to their school of choice			2
but @entity53 ’s house is exactly 260ft inside the three - mile boundary			0
his father @entity66 , 43 , said : ' we are outside the area by about 80 yards but to get to school it means @entity24 will have to walk through a forest			1
' another part of the route takes him through a very rough area where all the street lights have been smashed and there ’s drug paraphernalia all around			2

' the council thinks its alright for a boy of 11 to walk all that way through an unsafe area - i say it ’s not acceptable			2
unsafe : @entity53 's daily three mile trek will take him through a forest , drug dens , a waste - ground full of burned - out cars and areas classified as ' anti-social ' by police who say it 's not safe for him to walk alone ' they are not concerned about the children ’s personal safety , just road safety , as long as they are not walking near traffic they do n’t care			1

a @entity58 spokesman said : ' we understand the frustration of parents whose homes fall outside of the qualifying boundary for free transport to school			0
@entity110 : @entity53 's route to school is three miles long and has been deemed ' unsafe ' by police but the council say he still does n't qualify for free home to school transport which has frustrated his parents ' following the concerns raised by @entity24 ’ parents , council officers have been on site and carried out a full review of the walking route			1
' the assessment is based on a child being accompanied as appropriate by an adult , not a lone child			0
' as a result the route does meet the criteria as an available route which means @entity24 does not qualify for free home to school transport			0

@entity1 will have to walk through a forest , drug dens and a waste - ground full of burned out cars to school
police say the route is not safe as it includes an area where officers deal with anti-social problems and assaults
