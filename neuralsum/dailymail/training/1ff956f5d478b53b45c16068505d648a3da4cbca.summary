' habit : @entity2 told ms @entity1 to meet him in the toilet specially adapted for his disabled daughter @entity44 , pictured with @entity2 after he was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault , as if he had ' given the instructions before ' ‘ i wo n't go into who he told me it was , nor how and why he even had the photo , but take it from me , to say i was shocked would be an understatement			1
he went on to elaborate about his grimy sex secrets , and the way he operated			1
‘ by now my head was spinning			2
i did n't know whether to feel flattered that he was confiding this information so soon after meeting me , or completely grossed out at how he disgusting he was			2
but , i needed him			2
‘ he went on to tell me more disgusting pieces of information about his sex life , as well as enlightening me about his sexual cravings			1
‘ i truly did n't know if he was trying to impress me , flirt with me , or ask for some kind of retribution			2
it was the most bizarre experience i had ever had , and i 've had many			2
‘ i asked him how he 'd never ‘ got caught ’ , and why any of this had never been in the media			2
‘ he replied : ‘ you will never read anything negative about me , the press need me too much			2
i have them in the palm of my hand			2
’ ‘ and he pointed to various framed front - page stories he had brokered for numerous people			2
‘ he gave me a personally signed copy of his autobiography to read and also boasted about @entity103 and her story with @entity105 that he handled			2
‘ i was blown away by what i was hearing , and disappointed that the family - man caring image he put across in the media was all just a sham			2
’ ms @entity112 , pictured on @entity114 's @entity113 last year , revealed the details of her sordid business meeting with @entity2 in her newspaper column she told how she was ‘ deflated ’ when @entity2 said it would cost her £ 15,000 a month for his company to represent her for public relations			1
she writes : ‘ then , @entity2 did something else			1
he propositioned me there and then in his office			1
he told me how we could have some fun together and that ‘ we could look after each other			0
’ ‘ he also went on to tell me that if the dating site would agree to his fees then he would help me out in the media , and promote my book on the side , for free			0
‘ i realise now , in hindsight , he was grooming me			0
he then gave me his mobile number , and i gave him mine , and as i was about to leave , he suggested i meet him in the office toilets			1
‘ i was shell - shocked			0
i made an excuse and i left to go back to my hotel			0
‘ i 'd been booked to go back for a follow - up meeting with him two days later , which i did			0
he and i had also shared a few texts in between			0
‘ as i sat down in the leather chair again , i realised this second meeting was going to be more about business			0
albeit somewhat monkey - business , but business nevertheless			0
‘ @entity2 told me he 'd looked at my book , and liked it			1
he said he would like to put me in touch with a publisher friend of his			0
‘ he 'd also read the reality show concept i 'd written - based on infidelity and getting people to stop cheating - and said he 'd liked it a lot			0
‘ i 'll get this in front of @entity157 [ @entity158 ] if you want me to and if he likes it he may help you too , ’ he stated confidently			0
‘ he went on to flatter me ( it gets you everywhere right ? ) by telling me that i had a great message and i was bringing something new and different to the market with my work			0
' business meeting ' : ms @entity1 and @entity2 had sex in the disabled toilet of the offices of @entity54 in @entity171 's @entity6 ‘ he said i had some great ideas , i was smart and articulate , i was a good - looking girl , and that i just needed a bit of luck			1
‘ by now i was really starting to see a pattern about how this man operated			0
you scratch my back ( and other parts ) and i 'll scratch yours			0
‘ you stroke my ego ( and other parts ) and i 'll stroke yours			0
i could see i was going to have to go along with it all if i had any hope of making it in this business			0
‘ i was naïve and desperate in many ways , but i was n't a kid and i was n't stupid			0
i had lived and worked in @entity189 and knew all about the casting couches			0
‘ in hindsight that 's how toxic this business can be , and how desperate people can be to get a break into it			1
i 'm not proud of any of this , and i began to wonder how - in the space of just a few days - my business meetings with @entity2 could have possibly turned into what it was becoming			1
‘ we chatted on a few other ideas , and he called in his pr manager to join us and take some follow - up notes , and to make sure the dating site received his fee proposal contract the next day			0
‘ after she exited , and as our meeting was coming to a close , @entity2 made it clear that i was to go to the toilets outside the main office door when i left , and to wait for him in there			1
‘ but @entity2 , ’ i said nervously , ‘ what if any of the girls out in the office see me going in there and you coming in ? ’ ‘ do n't worry it 's foolproof , ’ he replied			1
‘ it will just look like you 're turning left to get into the lift down to the lobby			0
’ ‘ he was right			0
i guessed he had given these instructions before			0
@entity2 's daughter @entity44 , 42 , who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis , has been working with her father for 14 years and gave evidence defending him during his trial ‘ as i took the walk of shame towards the location of the @entity54 's toilets , the thing that would shock - and sicken - me the most , was when i found out @entity2 's casting couch would turn out to be his daughter 's specially adapted disabled toilet cubicle			1
‘ that is something i ca n't ever forget			0
‘ but what could i do ? i was there now , i was in the toilet , and that lock was about to be turned			1
literally ! ‘ without going into detail here , none of what happened in there was a pleasant experience for me , although it seemed to be for him			0
‘ he was extremely controlling and acted as if he was on a mission			0
all i kept thinking was that i hoped something would come out of it			0
‘ unsurprisingly , all the promises of help with my career never ever materialised			0
it saddens and sickens me to my stomach to this very day			0
