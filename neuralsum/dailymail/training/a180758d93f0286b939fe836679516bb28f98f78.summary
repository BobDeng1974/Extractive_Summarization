by @entity0 an incredible dinosaur track site with perfectly preserved footprints has been discovered in @entity3 , @entity4			1
the footprints belong to herds of duck - billed dinosaurs called hadrosaurs , which thrived in the ancient high - latitude , polar ecosystem in the @entity10 between 100 and 66 million years ago			1
they roamed the area in large family groups , travelling across the rugged terrain together			2
an incredible dinosaur track site with perfectly preserved footprints has been discovered in @entity3 , @entity4			1
one of the larger prints is pictured @entity17 , or duck - billed dinosaurs , are members of the family @entity17			1
the family includes lots of dinosaurs that were common herbivores in the @entity22 between 100 and 66million years ago			1
they lives in what is now @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			0
they are descendants of the iguanodontian dinosaurs of the @entity30			0
hadrosaurs are known as the duck - billed dinosaurs because of the sim8ilarity of the shape of their heads to modern ducks			1
the tracks show they travelled in large groups with babies travelling alongside much larger adults			1
some of the footprints are so detailed that they reveal the creatures ’ skin texture			2
even tracks of bugs and worms can be seen			2
the footprints were found by three palaeontologists in 2007 , when the @entity50 in the @entity51 of @entity3 had not been explored			1
on the last day , perched precariously on the steep side of the mountain , @entity54 , of @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and paleontologists from the @entity59 and @entity60 , were ‘ giddy – somewhere between giggling and crying ’ when they came across the wealth of tracks			2
‘ without question , @entity3 is one of the best dinosaur footprint localities in the world , but what we found that last day was incredible – so many tracks , so big , and so well preserved , ’ said dr @entity64			1
' the @entity72 ( pictured ) is extremely significant to the reconstruction of this @entity10 high latitude polar ecosystem , dr @entity71 of the @entity59 said			2
' the hadrosaur tracks show specifically where they lived and how they acted as an extended family ' the footprints belong to mulch - generational herds of duck - billed dinosaurs called hadrosaurs ( illustrated ) which thrived in the ancient high - latitude , polar ecosystem ‘ many had skin impressions so we could even see what the bottom of their feet looked like			1
and there were lots of invertebrate traces - the tracks of bugs , worms , larvae and more - which were important to us because they showed an ecosystem existed during the warm parts of the years			1
’ the paper , published in the journal @entity101 , provides an insight into the heard structure of hadrosaurs , which lived as families within the warmer - than - expected @entity107 climate			0
‘ the @entity3 tracksite is extremely significant to the reconstruction of this @entity10 high latitude polar ecosystem as it demonstrates higher annual temperatures compared to the present - day climate , ’ dr @entity71 of the @entity59 explained			1

the dinosaur track site was discovered in @entity3 , @entity4 ( mapped ) in 2007 by three palaeontologists some of the footprints ( pictured ) are so detailed that they show what the creatures ' skin looked like and tracks of bugs and worms were also revealed ‘ the burrows and trails of mud - loving beetles , mole crickets , midge fly larvae , and other sediment - dwelling beasties demonstrate that the whole cast of characters left their traces of life in the river bank sediments during the warm summer months - frozen in time , waiting to be discovered			1
’ the three paleontologists returned to the site to accurately measure and analyse the prints , which showed that four different age classes of @entity17 – adults , sub-adults , juveniles and very young individuals – lived together in a large social group			0
the team ’s research also suggests that the @entity17 dinosaurs – affectionately known as the ‘ cows of the @entity149 , ’ experienced a period of rapid growth in their life history			0
‘ this is one of the greatest dinosaur tracksites in the world in terms of size , number , and quality			0
we could see how hadrosaurs walked , ran , or slipped on muddy surface			0

a deep footprint is pictured ‘ footprints were so vivid that we almost could see and smell them , ’ said dr @entity174 of @entity60			0
‘ we were so excited when we found tiny , baby footprints , because we instantly knew this was the evidence to support the polar hadrosaurs survived through winters and lived as a herd to protect each other like other mammals do			2
’ the trio realised that the single bedding plane site was at risk from earthquake and could crumble and slide down the mountain into a nearby river			0
so @entity3 helped the paleontologists remove and preserve the specimens			0
the moulds were then transported to the @entity194 in @entity56 where they are now on display			2

the dinosaur track was discovered in @entity3 , @entity4
footprints belong to herds of duck - billed dinosaurs called hadrosaurs
they roamed the area in *multigenerational* groups and tracks made by babies were found next to larger adult footprints
footprints were first found by three palaeontologists in 2007
invertebrates tracks made by bugs reveal details about the ecosystem
creatures live in the @entity10 , between 100 and 66 million years ago
footprints are now displayed in @entity194 , @entity56
