@entity1 attacking midfielder @entity0 can feel momentum building at @entity3 and is hopeful the side 's winning run can continue throughout a busy december			1
@entity0 got on the scoresheet as @entity1 continued their recent revival after an indifferent start to the campaign , and in spite of a lengthy injury list , by overcoming @entity12 2 - 1 on tuesday			1
the victory was @entity1 's fourth in succession in the @entity16 and maintained their position in the top four			1
@entity0 ( right ) has called on his team - mates to build on their recent @entity16 wins @entity20 international @entity0 scored what turned out to be the winning goal against @entity12 @entity23 claimed he got a touch on the @entity26 's cross , however @entity0 has been awarded the goal the second win in that sequence was a hard - fought 2 - 0 success at @entity30 and @entity0 feels things have started to build from there			1
' it was very important to win at @entity30 and then to get two wins in a row at home , ' said @entity0 , also looking back to saturday 's convincing 3 - 0 defeat of @entity38			1
' now we have the chance to have a great december - probably the most important month in the league because we play more ( games )			2
' the @entity12 clash was actually @entity1 's first home night game of the season , a notable fixture quirk that also highlights their lack of @entity49 football this term			1
the gap between fixtures shrinks now , though , with six more games to be played up to and including @entity54			0
@entity1 will be tested at third - placed @entity55 next monday and then by @entity56 the following weekend , but @entity0 believes the team spirit , much maligned last season , is now starting to shine through			1
the 26 - year - old @entity26 said : ' the spirit is there			2
we have not been lucky with injuries , we 've had important players that could not play , but the spirit is there			0
' everyone was very happy in the dressing room after the game because it was a difficult game and we showed character			0
' @entity1 went ahead against the @entity72 as @entity73 continued his recent good spell of form by heading home midway through the first half			1
@entity73 rises unchallenged to give @entity1 the lead against @entity12 @entity73 celebrates putting @entity1 a goal up after 21 minutes at @entity3 as @entity80 sits on the turf @entity12 responded with a fine strike from @entity83 , but @entity1 claimed a decisive lead when @entity0 's 59th - minute free - kick from the right appeared to bounce straight in , although @entity23 claimed to have got a touch			1
@entity1 had the better of the play , but their performance was still not entirely convincing and @entity12 three times went close to snatching an equaliser in a breathless injury - time spell			1
first @entity93 produced a brilliant reflex save to keep out a @entity96 header			0
he then denied @entity97 from point - blank range and the rebound attempt from @entity96 was hacked off the line by @entity101			2
the goal decision system showed the ball was roughly two thirds over the line before @entity101 cleared or , as @entity12 boss @entity106 put it , a ' hair 's breadth ' away from going in			1
@entity0 said : ' it was very tough and we were , until the last minute , suffering			2
they played good in their way			0
they came here as a very compact team and they play good counter-attacks			0
@entity101 cleared the ball off the line in the closing stages of @entity1 's win against @entity12 @entity101 was delighted that goal - line technology allowed referee @entity121 to make the correct decision ' at the end , it 's a very important win , a fourth win in a row and we are getting closer			1
' it was the second time in two games @entity1 had seen the benefits of goal - line technology , with defender @entity131 awarded a goal in another close call on saturday			1
@entity101 said : ' the referee was there with his watch and as soon as the ball hit my foot and was cleared off the line i looked to see if he was whistling for a goal			0
' he was n't and we managed to hold on to the win , so thank @entity145 for goal - line technology			2
' @entity83 was at a loss to explain how he ended up on the losing side after such a frantic ending			2
the @entity150 , who found the net with a powerful drive from 20 yards , told the @entity72 ' website , www.stokecityfc.com : ' we 're very unlucky			0
i do n't know what to say			0
' in the second half they played better , but we had some good chances a the end of the game			0
i do n't know how we did n't score them			0
they have a really good goalkeeper , but it 's unlucky			0
' it 's really disappointing			0
we could have come here and got a point but we lost			0
we are going to have to work really hard on saturday against @entity30			2
' @entity12 goalscorer @entity83 felt his side were unlucky not to come away from @entity3 with a point			1

@entity1 ace @entity0 feels his side are building momentum
