eating less meat is ' essential ' to ensure future demand for food can be met and ' dangerous ' climate change avoided , experts have warned			1
a study by leading university researchers in @entity7 and @entity8 found food production alone could exceed targets for greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 if current trends continue			1
population growth and the global shift towards ' meat - heavy @entity16 diets ' has meant increasing agricultural yields will not meet projected food demands for an expected 9.6 billion world population in 30 years , according to the researchers			1
researchers in @entity7 and @entity8 say food production could cause targets for greenhouse gas emissions to be exceeded in 2050			1
meat - heavy diets mean that project food demands will not be met for an expected 9.6 billion world population in 30 years increased deforestation , fertiliser use and livestock methane emissions are likely to cause greenhouse gas emissions from food production to rise by almost 80 per cent , experts from the @entity28 and @entity29 found			1
a report released earlier this year came to similar conclusions , that emissions from agriculture threaten to keep increasing as global meat and dairy consumption increases			2
if agricultural emissions are not addressed , nitrous oxide from fields and methane from livestock may double by 2070			2
this alone would make meeting the climate target essentially impossible			0
' we have shown that reducing meat and dairy consumption is key to bringing agricultural climate pollution down to safe levels , ' said @entity53 , @entity54			0
' broad dietary change can take a long time			0
we should already be thinking about how we can make our food more climate friendly			0
' by 2050 , estimates indicate that beef and lamb will account for half of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions , while only contributing three per cent of human calorie intake			1
cheese and other dairy products will account for about one quarter of total agricultural climate pollution			0
lead researcher @entity67 , from the @entity28 's department of engineering , said : ' agricultural practices are not necessarily at fault here - but our choice of food is			0
' it is imperative to find ways to achieve global food security without expanding crop or pastureland			1
' food production is a main driver of biodiversity loss and a large contributor to climate change and pollution , so our food choices matter			2
' he added : ' cutting food waste and moderating meat consumption in more balanced diets , are the essential ' no - regrets ' options			2
' according to the study in @entity96 , current trends in food production will mean that by 2050 cropland will have expanded by 42 per cent and fertiliser use increased by 45 per cent over 2009 levels			1
a further tenth of the world 's pristine tropical forests would disappear over the next 35 years , it said			0
increased deforestation , fertiliser use and livestock methane will raise emissions by up to 80 per cent			1
the experts say better global food security without using more land is needed to mitigate global warming the study 's authors tested a scenario where all countries were assumed to have an ' average ' balanced diet - without excessive consumption of sugars , fats , and meat products			1
the average balanced diet used in the study was a ' relatively achievable goal ' , the researchers said , which included two 85 - gram ( 0.2 pounds ) portions of red meat and five eggs per week , as well as a portion of poultry a day			2
' this significantly reduced the pressures on the environment even further , ' they said			0
co-author professor @entity133 , from the @entity29 , said : ' unless we make some serious changes in food consumption trends , we would have to completely de-carbonise the energy and industry sectors to stay within emissions budgets that avoid dangerous climate change			0
' that is practically impossible - so , as well as encouraging sustainable agriculture , we need to re-think what we eat			0
' @entity7 co-author prof @entity144 said : ' this is not a radical vegetarian argument ; it is an argument about eating meat in sensible amounts as part of healthy , balanced diets			2
' managing the demand better , for example by focusing on health education , would bring double benefits - maintaining healthy populations , and greatly reducing critical pressures on the environment			0
