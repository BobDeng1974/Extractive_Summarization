a high school junior has told of her anger after being suspended from school over dying her hair a ' normal color '			1
@entity5 from @entity6 , @entity7 , used a @entity9 brand dye kit to permanently color her auburn hair to a ' deep ultra-intense red ' while she was snowed in at home with her mother			1
however , when the teenager returned to classes at @entity16 - 4 this week she was pulled out of the lunch queue and told her new coiffure violated the school 's grooming code			1
her mane was apparently branded ' distracting ' , ' bright ' and ' orange ' by members of staff			0
her 40 - year - old mother - who had a helping hand in the transformation - concurs			1
' i dyed it auburn , which is what was on the box			0
and auburn to me is natural , just like strawberry blonde or blonde , or black or brown , ' she told @entity48			2
' she just wanted it a little bit different			0
we had a bunch of snow days , and did some girl stuff and dyed her hair			0
' the mother and daughetr did n't expect any objection to the dye			2
however , when the teenager returned to classes at @entity16 - 4 this week she was pulled out of the lunch queue and told her new ' orange ' coiffure violated the school 's dress and grooming code			1
in writing : indeed , the rules state that non-natural hair colors are not permitted speaking out : however @entity30 argues that her shoulder - length hair is n't purple , green or blue and only a little brighter than her natural shade her 40 - year - old mother ( pictured ) agrees but @entity30 said that the principal told her to call her mother on tuesday to be picked up			1
she then tried to return to lessons the following day but was instructed to stay at home because her hair remained unchanged			2
@entity82 superintendent @entity81 said she could n't comment specifically on @entity30 's situation , but he says the hair color policy has been in place for decades			1
' we try to work with the students to be fair			0
we do n't want them out of school , we do n't typically have issues with this policy			0
i think our students and parents are accepting of it			0
it 's been in place a long time , and i think it 's a policy that works			0
' @entity30 refuses to dye her hair back to its original color as a matter of principal			1
she plans to appeal the principal and superintendent â€™s decision and take it before the school board			2
her mother , meanwhile , wishes the school would worry about bigger issues			0
' instead of maybe picking up on the bullying , and kids who are actually causing trouble , its hair color , ' she concluded			0
superintendent @entity118 has since told @entity119 that the hair dye issue has been resolved but she was ' unable to go into specifics ' .			1
