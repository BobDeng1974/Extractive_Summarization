by @entity0 for @entity1 by the time transfer deadline day arrived , @entity3 ’s career had reached a crossroads in every sense			2
sadly , his journey through the ranks at @entity12 had reached a dead end			2
forced to train with the reserves at @entity15 last week after manager @entity16 took him to one side and informed him that the imminent arrival of @entity19 would further limit his first - team opportunities , @entity3 knew his time was up after 14 years at the club			1
little more than a month after @entity25 handed him the honour of captaining @entity12 for the first time against @entity28 on pre-season tour in @entity30 , the @entity24 midfielder had joined the list of players earmarked for the @entity34 exit			1
kitted out : @entity3 poses with an @entity7 shirt at @entity36 on wednesday smiles better : the midfielder completed a loan move from @entity12 during the transfer window goodbye ? @entity3 in action against @entity42 last month in what could be his final @entity12 appearance @entity3 ’s subsequent departure was a little messy , to say the least			1
he was halfway down the @entity46 en route to undergo a medical at @entity7 on monday after @entity12 accepted a £ 7.5million bid when @entity8 attempted to hijack the deal			1
that fell flat when their offer of £ 5.5m was rejected by @entity12 chief @entity54 , and @entity7 rushed through a loan move that was only ratified by the @entity56 on tuesday afternoon			1
it is safe to assume that those first fraught phone calls from @entity7 boss @entity59 and his assistant @entity60 were less than polite			1
however , when the dust settles and @entity3 adjusts to his new environment at @entity64 , he may come to the conclusion that this is a not a bad career move after all			0
his once burgeoning reputation has taken something of a battering over the past 12 months			0
a player whose selfless contribution to the team was not always appreciated by supporters who demanded more from those wearing a @entity12 shirt became a prime target during @entity12 ’s alarming decline under @entity77			0
played out of position and then not at all by the @entity80 , his confidence dipped			0
scapegoat : @entity3 came to represent the @entity83 ' fall from the top under @entity77 fall guy : a handful of @entity24 fans set up a poisonous petition against @entity3 playing for the national team the situation took a poisonous turn in february when an online petition was set up calling for him to be axed from the @entity24 squad			1
publicly , @entity94 stood by @entity3 but it was perhaps no surprise that the combination of events meant that he did not go to the @entity99 in @entity100			0
although @entity25 ’s reputation as a coach who likes to build from within and work with younger players initially augured well for his future at @entity12 , the club ’s spectacular £ 150m summer spending spree told otherwise			1
@entity3 and his old friend @entity107 were out as @entity12 turned to big - name signings like @entity109 and @entity110 on astronomical wages of £ 280,000 - a - week			1
that is 10 times more than @entity3 earned at @entity34 but some still accused him of greed for haggling over his personal terms with @entity7			1
at the age of 25 , however , he knows that his next contract is likely to be the most important of his career			0
where that will be remains to be seen			0
he will spend the rest of the season at @entity7 who have an option to renew their £ 7.5m offer in january			1
it is unlikely that @entity8 will have been discouraged by their unsuccessful attempt to sign him on monday			0
unlike @entity107 , who will earn in excess of £ 100,000 - a - week following his £ 16m move to @entity128 , @entity3 has had to take a step back			2
in the long run , it may turn out to be a blessing in disguise			0
the important thing is to get his mind back on playing football at a club where he will be given every chance to shine			0
a player who first made his mark away from @entity12 on loan at @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 must do so again			2
hard as nails : @entity12 legend @entity60 ( centre right ) is now assistant manager at @entity7 streetwise : the midfielder made his name while on successful loan spells at @entity143 and @entity144 @entity60 knows a thing or two about leaving @entity12 and the @entity152 could be a key figure in @entity3 ’s rehabilitation at @entity7			1
the former @entity34 skipper will relish the opportunity to rebuild the midfielder ’s confidence and develop his game			0
this , after all , was a young man who was frequently tipped for stardom by sir @entity163			0
@entity3 , who was 11 - years - old when he chose @entity34 ahead of @entity164 and @entity165 , has proved @entity12 wrong before			2
their academy coaches thought that he would be too small to make the grade , but he went on to play a total of 79 games for the first - team			0
even though @entity3 and @entity12 have now gone their separate ways , it ’s by no means the end of the road .			2

@entity3 has joined @entity7 on loan from @entity12
@entity24 midfielder was frozen out by @entity16 at @entity12
@entity7 have option to *buy* @entity3 for £ 7.5m in january , with @entity8 also in the running
@entity7 assistant @entity60 is key to @entity3 *'s* future
