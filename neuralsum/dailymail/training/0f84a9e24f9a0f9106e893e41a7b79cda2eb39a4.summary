by @entity0 when it comes to a beloved child 's birthday , parents have long gone all out to ensure that their day is as special as possible			2
but it seems that pleasing the little darlings is setting parents back more than ever , as the typical cost of a children ’s birthday party rises to more than £ 214			2
on average , a parent will fork out an average of £ 214.54 per party , while 64 per cent say they want to ensure their child enjoys a ‘ super sweet 16 ’ style bash every single birthday			0
extravagant : parents are so desperate to please their children and outdo their friends that they spend , on average , £ 214 per party @entity24 found a third of mothers and fathers splash out on their children 's birthday bash to guarantee it is ‘ better than their friend 's ’			1
and the pressure is so great for one in 11 parents ( nine per cent ) that they would spend a staggering £ 800 - at least - on a party for their child			1
the study looked at the growing trend of hugely extravagant celebrations thrown by parents for their children 's birthdays			2
so fancy are some birthday parties that two per cent of the 1,000 parents surveyed said their child has received an @entity43 in their party bag			2
furthermore , 16 per cent said their child had found make - up in their party bag , while four per cent had received gift vouchers			1
and as part of the research , children aged between 5 - 13 were also polled to find out the criteria for the perfect party			0
competitive : research found a third of mothers and fathers splash out on their children 's birthday bash to guarantee it is ' better than their friend 's ' according to the young respondents , the ideal party would be held at a theme park and last five hours eight minutes , with 30 guests invited			1
meanwhile , the bash should also involve them receiving 17 presents , lunch at @entity66 ’s and even a guest appearance from footballer @entity68			0
interestingly though , children would rather their grandparents , 47 per cent , and school friends , 67 per cent , attend their party than @entity73			0
in contrast , the study also asked the parents polled how their children ’s parties differ to the ones they had when they were growing up			0
perfect combination : children voted their top birthday party would see @entity68 in attendance and be held at a theme park with lunch at @entity66 's one in five , 21 per cent , admitted they did n’t even have a birthday party while growing up			1
and those who did said on their gift list were items such as clothes , board games and outdoor activity games - not televisions and games consoles			0
@entity94 , from @entity95 , who carried out the survey , said : ' though the blueprint for the ideal party is quite staggering , parents need n’t feel under pressure to make these parties become reality			1
' it ’s great if parents can include some elements of the blueprint in their kids ’ parties but it ’s not essential to have them all , like @entity68 attending			0
' what is refreshing from this research , is children put immediate family and close friends higher up on their guest list than their favourite celebs			0
' the only way is pop : the children would also love to see @entity73 at their party and have @entity120 's music on repeat where : a trip to the theme @entity124 : 19 friends , seven family members and four @entity128 : five hours and eight @entity129 : illusionist and make - up @entity131 : @entity132 ’s , followed by a chocolate fountain with fruit and sweets to @entity136 : @entity120 and the saturday ’s latest chart topping cds on @entity139 : 17 presents , including an @entity141 , @entity142 , money and a @entity144 : huge and with more candles than their yearsparty bags : at least nine gifts including a gadget ( such as a @entity149 ) or a giant @entity151 guest wish list : one direction and @entity68 top the poll by quite a way			1

third of parents splash out to guarantee party is better than friend 's party
9 *%* spend at least £ 800
gift bags can even contain @entity43 , make - up and gift cards
ideal party would be at theme park with lunch at @entity170 , say children
ideal celebrity guests are @entity68 and one direction
