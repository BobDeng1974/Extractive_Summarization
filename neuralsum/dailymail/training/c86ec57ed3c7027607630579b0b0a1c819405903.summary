by @entity0 the nightingale is in dangerous decline and could disappear from @entity4 if breeding sites are not protected from developers , experts have warned			1
a 2012 survey by the @entity8 showed there are just 3300 pairs of nightingales left in the whole country			1
data from the organisation also suggests the number of the birds in @entity4 dropped by 57 per cent between 1995 and 2009			1
now , nature - lovers are calling for a recording of the creature to be broadcast live on @entity38			2
the idea marks a tradition set almost 90 years ago by the @entity38 - which on may 18th 1924 broadcast the sound of a nightingale singing in a @entity44 wood to almost a million listeners			2
the broadcast became a tradition for 20 years until it was halted by the war			2
conservationist @entity49 , who has launched the petition calling for the broadcast to be reinstated , said : ' the nightingale is just one of many songbirds , which are rapidly vanishing from our countryside , our urban green sanctuaries and suburban woods , and therefore from our lives ' unfortunately developers and politicians do n't care enough to ward off the most obvious threats at bay - at @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity4 's only woodland specifically designated as a valued breeding site for nightingales is under threat from developers			1
there are only 3300 pairs of nightingales left in the whole of @entity4 - with numbers of the birds dropping by 57 per cent in 14 years data suggests ' we would like the @entity38 to restore the tradition and re-connect people all over @entity4 with the song of the nightingale , live , on may 18th			1
' ' we believe it 's time for the @entity38 to re-start the tradition , to enrich our quality of life and give its millions of listeners the chance to hear a real , live nightingale singing , if only once a year			2
' fewer and fewer people now get to hear the song these days and the reasons are complex - researchers blame a combination of climate change , farm development in its @entity95 wintering grounds , the destruction of nesting habitat by muntjac deer in this country , poor woodland management and pesticides , for its decline			0
' anyone who has ever heard the song of a nightingale , knows the extraordinary heart - lifting , soul - penetrating power of the voice of this bird			0
' @entity108 , of the @entity8 said : ' the song of the nightingale is arguably the most beautiful of any @entity4 bird but it is a song that is getting harder to hear with each passing year			1
' its stronghold has always been the south - east but even here it is declining and since 1995 we have lost almost half of our breeding nightingales			0
' add to this the very short song period , nightingales can only be reliably heard during the last days of april to the first few days of june , and we can all appreciate that hearing one is very special indeed			0
' slightly larger than a robin , nightingales were first noted in @entity122 times though fossilised remains date them back to as long as 100,000 years ago			0
the creature inspired @entity125 to write one of his most famous poems - @entity127			0
