by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 14:24 est , 30 december 2013 updated : 04:50 est , 1 january 2014 fine : @entity5 film director @entity4 , is facing a £ 100 million lawsuit , after being accused of fathering seven children one of @entity5 's most celebrated film directors has said he broke the country 's strict one - child policy because of an ancient traditional belief that having multiple children would lead to greater prosperity			1
@entity4 , who directed hit movies @entity15 and @entity16 as well as the opening and closing ceremonies at the @entity19 , is now facing a £ 100million fine after months of rumours that he fathered as many as seven children			1
he has admitted having two sons and a daughter with his current wife and a daughter with his ex wife , in a statement			1
@entity4 , who faces an official penalty largely based on his and his wife 's income in the years before each child was born , also claimed that one year he only earned $ 450			1
in an interview with the official @entity34 news agency on sunday , the director said he broke the law because his father told him before dying that he wanted a grandson to ' carry on the family name '			0
he said : ' traditionally my parents and i thought the more children one has , the more prosperous the family would be			2
' the one - child policy was put in place to control @entity5 's booming population , and officials say it has been key to the country 's rising prosperity			0
but with demographic experts warning of a labour shortage within the next two decades , @entity5 's @entity51 leaders last month moved to expand the exceptions to the policy after a key meeting in @entity57 , allowing couples to have two children if one of the parents is an only child			2
@entity4 has come under mounting criticism for taking advantage of his fame and wealth , but said his family had suffered because they had broken the rules , according to the report			1
' we were hiding here and there as " extra-birth guerillas " ' , @entity4 said , referring to a tv comedy in the 1990s about a couple who went on the run to have multiple babies			1
' my fault has negatively affected my children 's childhood significantly , ' he added			2
controversial : @entity5 's one - child policy was put in place to control @entity5 's booming population , and officials say it has been key to the country 's rising prosperity critics say @entity5 's late - 1970s family - planning law , which restricts most couples to one child , is selectively and sometimes brutally enforced , while the wealthy and well - connected are easily able to pay the fines levied for extra offspring			0
but some users of @entity5 's popular online social networks have directed their anger at the policy itself , rather than @entity4 , with some hoping the attention heaped on his case may hasten the eventual demise of the law , which authorities have recently moved to relax			1
the policy was put in place to control @entity5 's booming population , and officials say it has been key to the country 's rising prosperity			0
but opposition to it has steadily grown among members of the public as well as among demographic experts , who warn that it has led to a decline in @entity5 's working - age population and a swelling of the ranks of the elderly that could bring about a labour shortage within the next two decades			0
those fears appear to be shared by @entity5 's @entity51 leaders , who after a key meeting in @entity57 last month moved to expand the exceptions to the policy to allow couples to have two children if one of the parents is an only child			2
talent : many of @entity4 's films , such as the @entity132 ( pictured ) have proved popular with audiences in the @entity136 as well as @entity5 spectacular : @entity4 masterminded the breath - taking opening and closing ceremonies at the @entity19 in the past @entity5 web users have typically responded with fury to reports of celebrities escaping the one - child regulation , but sentiments over the past week have been more mixed , with some citing @entity4 as an example of why the law should be scrapped			1
' we should be grateful to @entity4 ! ' one posted on @entity150 , a @entity5 equivalent of @entity151			1
' thanks to his popularity , he 's made the whole society debate the problems of the ' family planning policy ' ! this might help speed up the abolition of this draconian law			0
' another said the controversy was ' more than ridiculous ' , adding : ' @entity162 is a fundamental human instinct and a way of passing things on to future generations			0
here in @entity5 , it 's actually become a crime			0
' in 2012 , 24 of the country 's 31 provinces and regions collected a total of nearly 20 billion yuan in penalties , the @entity169 reported thursday			0
none of the provincial authorities has detailed how the money was spent .			0
