father - of - five @entity8 , 51 , had just taken up a job at the top secret @entity11 office - where the firm makes unimaginable inventions a reality - when he died in @entity15 , @entity16 , in november 2013			1
the only other person aboard the yacht was @entity19 , 27 , who will be tried for manslaughter , drug charges and prostitution on february 23			1
she is pleading not guilty			1
and the entire case hangs on a video of the entire night			2
it took three months and a court order to obtain the footage - which changed everything			1
there was indeed video that was uploaded to a cloud server			2
and the video from that camera was indeed available , ' @entity15 deputy police chief @entity50 tells 48 hours in a new documentary about the case			1
' that was one of those moments where you feel like , you know , it was 4th and 1			2
and you got a first down			0

it looks like she tries to revive him a bit ... by patting him on the face and talking to him , holding his head as he slumped forward on the chair			0
' and you or i , if we found ourselves in that situation , would 've been on the phone to 911 , saying : " oh , my gosh			0
