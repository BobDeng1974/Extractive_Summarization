when @entity1 , a couples counsellor for @entity2 , met her partner @entity3 she was n't aware of his dependency on alcohol			1
' over the next five years i changed into someone i did n't recognise , ' she writes in her new book , in which she tells the story of their relationship in @entity12			0
' someone my friends started not to recognise			0
' i became physically ill , certainly emotionally distraught and i am forced to admit now what my mental capabilities were suspect as well on many occasion			0
' initially , @entity1 thought she could change @entity3			1
that she could fix him			0
she felt his recovery depended entirely on her being there - and not only because @entity3 was an alcoholic , but because he was also going blind			1
in blind drunk @entity1 tells the story of how they met , fell in love , tumbled into the destructive co-dependency of addict and carer , and eventually saved themselves and their relationship by having time apart			1
@entity1 , left , likens living with a blind alcoholic to being the ' carer of a delinquent teenage rebel ' writing about when she and @entity3 first met ( in a pub ) , @entity1 wonders if it was his ' helplessness ' that drew her in and attracted her to him			1
she says : ' had @entity3 just been drunk i wonder whether we would have got entangled , but since he was blind and drunk , disadvantaged in life , presently fearful and very anxious [ ... ] i felt for him thinking i could ease his emotional pain			1
' similarly , @entity1 's strong personality was a draw to @entity3 , who had endured an abusive relationship at the hands of his alcoholic father			1
she writes : ' he had tried to cling to his mother and she probably did her best to protect him , especially as he was visually impaired			0
' as a result , my guess is that he was attracted to me as a solid , older woman who had surprisingly stayed and listened to him			0
' @entity1 expects that @entity3 used alcohol to drown the sorrows of a traumatic childhood and a degenerative eye condition but @entity3 's blindness made their relationship trickier , with @entity1 often excusing his behaviour to herself and to friends , or thinking he was acting in certain ways because he could n't see , not because he was inebriated			1
' suddenly his mood would change , ' she says			0
' not to mention the staggering , knocking into furniture and falling down , but after all , i told myself , he was blind			2
' his eyesight was a big stumbling block for me ! sometimes it seemed i had become the carer of a delinquent teenage rebel			0
' as @entity3 became emotionally absent and began lying to her and hiding alcohol , @entity1 became angry and aggressive			1
life , she says , was ' unmanageable '			0
@entity68 's blindness made their relationship trickier , with @entity1 often excusing his behaviour to herself and to friends , or thinking he was acting in certain ways because he could n't see , not because he was inebriated things came to a head on 7 july 2005 , the morning of the 7/7 bombings , when @entity1 told @entity3 she would n't see him again until he stopped drinking			1
at this point @entity78 becomes a guide to being the partner to an alcoholic			2
@entity1 says an alcoholic must want to recover themselves , and that your insistence that they do so is simply not enough			1
she advocates ' detachment ' : distancing yourself from your dependent and focusing instead on improving your own life			0
' by detaching and leaving him to it i showed i cared			0
it sounds perverse but by staying , coping and being a martyr in effect , i was exercising pity and indicating @entity3 was a failure and had no hope of going it alone or recovering			2
@entity3 benefited from their detachment , recovered , and the couple are still together			2
' when they make it sobriety really is reincarnation in the same lifetime , ' @entity1 says			2
alcohol is a drug that is extremely addictive what to remember : your family member or friend is not a bad person they crave a drug that is addictive this addiction is probably 10 % physical , 90 % psychological no one forces them to put a glass to their lips , but they never meant their lives to go down this route anyone can become addicted : if you drink enough for long enough , even you most people deny they have a problem denial has many sides , layers and levels to it the drinker has a disease , and that disease is progressive you and the whole family are affected by it the drinker can stop , but only if they stop drinking			0

@entity1 's partner @entity3 has alcoholism and vision impairment
both *afflictions* run in the family - liam 's father was alcoholic
@entity1 initially thought she could help him come to terms with blindness
@entity3 is now sober after @entity1 practiced ' tough love '
@entity1 's *autobiography* blind drunk chronicles their life together
*teaches* others how to deal with similar *situations*
