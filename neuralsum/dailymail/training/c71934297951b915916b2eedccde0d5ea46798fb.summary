by @entity0 for @entity1 when is a $ 100 bill not worth $ 100 ? when it 's in @entity4 , where it 's worth $ 116			1
or in @entity6 , where the value shrinks to just $ 85			0
a new map by the non-partisan @entity9 reveals that the cost of living difference between states means the value of the cash in your pocket varies wildly			2
the @entity9 used federal data on regional price variations to calculate just how far a @entity19 goes in all 50 states			2
and the differences are striking			0
a dollar is worth 30percent more in @entity4 than it is in @entity24 , @entity24 - which has the highest prices in the country			1
the @entity9 used new federal data to show that $ 100 goes a lot farther in some states than others - and it varies by up to 30percent , based on prices differences between regions the @entity9 showed how residents of @entity34 are actually richer than @entity36 residents after factoring in the price of goods the states $ 100 goes the farthest are : @entity4 ( $ 115.74 ) , @entity40 ( $ 114.16 ) , @entity41 ( $ 113.51 ) , @entity42 ( 113.51 ) , and @entity43 ( $ 113.38 )			1
the states where $ 100 is worth the least are : @entity24 ( $ 84.60 ) , @entity6 ( $ 85.32 ) , @entity36 ( $ 86.66 ) , @entity45 ( $ 87.64 ) , and @entity46 ( $ 88.57 )			1
in some states , $ 100 is still just $ 100			1
in @entity49 a c - note is worth $ 99.40			1
in @entity51 and @entity52 , it 's worth $ 101.21			0
@entity9 says the regional cost differences , which were recently released by the @entity54 for the first time ever , could help @entity56 rethink the places that they live			2
for instance , @entity58 has a significantly lower average income compared to @entity36 ( $ 37,000 vs $ 45,000 )			0
adjusted for cost of living differences , however , @entity58 jumps several places in the rankings and @entity36 falls several places - making the real average income in @entity58 $ 41,000 and just $ 39,000 in @entity36			1
all this means that $ 50,000 after taxes in a high cost of living state like @entity36 is really worth just $ 43,000			2
that same $ 50,00 in @entity58 actually feels more like $ 56,000			0
the public policy implications are also immense ; $ 100 in food assistance to a poor family in @entity24 , would buy less than $ 85 worth of food , while it will buy nearly $ 116 in @entity4			1
the @entity54 introduced the federal government 's first - ever statistics on regional price differences in april			2
the data to calculate the cost of living variation across the country is culled from @entity82 information			0
the @entity82 continually measures the cost of a ' basket of goods ' in cities across the nation to keep track of inflation			0
the data , however , also provides insight into price differences in communities across the country			0
the @entity82 testers keep track of prices of things like :			0

map by the @entity9 compares price differences between states - which can vary by more than 30percent
@entity24 , @entity6 , @entity36 and @entity45 are the places $ 100 is worth the least
a c - note goes farthest in @entity4 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42
