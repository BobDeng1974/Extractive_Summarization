by @entity0 this is one remarkable story of the undeniable love between a man and his best friend			0
it took @entity6 , a 12 - month - old @entity7 , 13 days to be finally reunited with his beloved owner @entity8 after falling off the back of his ute - 45km from home			1
and boy , was he happy to see him			0
with a broken leg , a starved @entity6 survived on sheep and cattle dung as he trekked it back to mr @entity8 's @entity17 farm in south - western @entity18			1
' i 've always been a dog lover and always had them around , ' he told @entity25			0
' i was ready to adopt another one and when i went over to the animal shelter , @entity6 appealed to me the most			2
' he was of three in the litter and had the best personality			0
he was excited , affectionate and just wanted someone to take him home			0
' since then , the pair have been inseparable			0
so taking @entity6 on a trip to neighbouring town @entity33 on june 20 was no exception			2
but it was only when mr @entity8 , from @entity20 in south - western regional @entity18 , arrived at his destination that he realised his dog was missing			1
mr @entity8 was driving to @entity33 , south - western @entity18 , with his 12 - month - old pup in the back of his ute on june 20 but on the way , @entity6 got lost and could n't be found when his owner went back to find him ' @entity6 was chained to the back because i was doing sharp turns on the highway but when i arrived at the place i went around the back and saw no dog , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' the collar had come undone and i presumed @entity6 had jumped off onto the highway			2
' so mr @entity8 went back to retrace his tracks several times			1
' i drove up and down the highway , hoping to see a dog roaming around , ' he said			0
by then , mr @entity8 had feared the worst			1
' i was travelling about 100km an hr so i knew it would 've been a pretty tough fall for him , ' he said			0
' i was half expecting to see him dead on the side of the road but i just wanted to find him			0
' he then received an unexpected call on thursday afternoon			0
' people on my @entity17 farm asked me if i knew anything about a black dog which was just sitting on the verandah , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' they told me he had a flea collar and that 's when i knew it was my dog			0
' mr @entity8 is pictured with his grandchildren @entity71 , 7 , and @entity72 , 5 @entity6 is clearly a great addition to the @entity72 family as he 's been described as a loyal and affectionate pup mr @entity8 says he was ' over the moon ' , jumped in the car straight away and drove to the farm			1
' i could n't believe it , ' he said			0
' @entity6 would 've been hopping for most of that journey on his three good legs because he had a cut up the front left one			2
the tear was pretty bad			0
' a check from the local veterinary hospital revealed that @entity6 had survived on cattle and sheep dung while he was on the road for 13 days			2
although @entity6 has proved that he is one hell of a fighter , mr @entity8 revealed that this is the second time his dog has beat death			1
' three three weeks before @entity6 was lost he ate rat poisoning and survived , ' mr @entity8 said			1
now the pup is said to be doing well and simply ' happy as @entity99 to be home '			2
' he 'll probably have a limp for awhile but he 's a celebrity and going great guns , ' mr @entity8 said			1
when asked whether @entity6 will return to his post at the back of the ute , mr @entity8 said : ' oh he 's progressed to first class and sits in the front seat			1
' ' he 's getting the royal treatment now			0
' @entity110 , 7 , is thrilled to play with his grandfather 's 12 - month - old @entity7 mr @entity8 , a self - confessed dog lover , says he is ' over the moon ' to have @entity6 back home @entity6 survived on cattle and sheep dung during his 13 - day trek back home			1
