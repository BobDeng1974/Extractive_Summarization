@entity6 , seen here showing his muscles to full affect at a competition , can lift weights the equivalent of an adult polar bear ' it 's quite funny to see colleague 's reaction when they call for it support and i show up			1
i think people expect us all to look like the guys from @entity58			0
' but you could say i am probably @entity2 's toughest it geek			0
' gentle giant @entity6 , who still lives at home with his parents @entity63 and @entity65 and sister @entity66 , in @entity67 at @entity68 , @entity69 , works in the @entity25 head office it department			1

' proud mother @entity63 , 49 , said : ' we 've gone all over the world to support @entity6			1
' i 'm so proud of him			0
the fact he 's doing it naturally , with no performance - enhancing drugs , is all the more impressive			0
