by @entity0 less than a month after their horsing around in @entity4 , princes @entity1 and @entity2 are at it again - but they had to be on their best behaviour			0
their real grandmother may not have been among the packed crowd at a charity polo match today , but her screen counterpart @entity13 was there to watch			2
the celebrated actress shared a joke with the princely pair as the @entity18 - fresh from a good luck visit to the @entity20 's locker room - teamed up with his newly - single brother for the match in @entity25 , @entity26			1
but there was disappointment for the celebrities , who also included the actress @entity31 , comedy star @entity32 and explorer @entity33 - as the princes ' team lost the nail - biting clash 5 - 4 in the last few minutes			1
a gift ? for me ? fresh from paying a good luck visit to the @entity20 football team , prince @entity1 met his screen grandmother dame @entity13 at a charity polo match sharing a joke : dame @entity13 and prince @entity2 wore broad smiles as they were accompanied by her husband , director of @entity48 charity : the annual event was in aid of three charities in which the princes hold senior roles and has raised more than Â£ 1.5million over the last 10 years horsing around : princes @entity1 and @entity2 teamed up for a charity polo match in @entity25 , @entity26 , in one of their first appearances together since @entity60 's wedding sporting : the princes ' team lost 5 - 4 in the nail - biting last few minutes of the match			1
the day was in aid of three charities close to their hearts , including the @entity66 in action : the invitation - only event featured around 300 people including film and tv actresses			2
pictured , prince @entity2 playing for the @entity73 team today brotherly day out : while their grandmother famously declines to wear a helmet when she is out riding , the faster - moving princes were more cautious horsing around : prince @entity2 in full gear at the match today			2
he founded the @entity80 charity in @entity81 , which has the third - highest hiv infection rate in the world team sport : the polo match went on for an hour and was watched by an invitation - only crowd of more than 300 people			2
the princes ' team lost at the last moment the pair were playing today in the annual @entity93 at the @entity95 club in @entity25 , @entity26			1
a two - day event , it was expected to raise tens of thousands of pounds for three charities close to the princes ' hearts : the @entity66 cancer hospital in @entity102 , @entity103 , the youth training charity @entity104 and the @entity82 fund @entity80			1
prince @entity1 is the president of the @entity66 and the @entity106 patron of @entity104 , while @entity2 founded @entity80 with prince @entity107			1
the @entity110 nation has the third - highest hiv infection rate in the world - a third of its children are orphans and more than 37,000 children under 14 are living with the disease			0
so the princes ' appearance was no surprise - and last year , it was the @entity18 's first public day out after the birth of @entity121			0
charitable : prince @entity1 is the president of the @entity66 and the @entity106 patron of @entity104 , while @entity2 founded @entity80 with @entity123 of @entity81 the princes ' appearance was no surprise			1
last year it was the @entity18 's first public day out after the birth of @entity121 , and he was rewarded with a baby mallet saddling up : the match is played every year and went on for around an hour , with the event expected to raise tens of thousands of pounds for charity coming home : it was a nail - biting finish for the princes , whose team lost 5 - 4 in the last few minutes of the match at the @entity95 club in @entity25 , @entity26 elite : the @entity137 met the invitation - only crowd , including their on - screen grandmother alongside @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity140 to mark the occasion last year , @entity73 's @entity142 director @entity141 presented him with a baby polo mallet			1
but while last year @entity1 's @entity73 team won a respectable 8 - 7 against competitors @entity147 , this year the royal team lost the hour - long match in the last few minutes			2
the loss would have been particularly galling considering the unusual prize - some silver wine coolers in the shape of polo helmets			0
the invitation - only event featured 300 people from the worlds of film , television , pop and journalism			0
