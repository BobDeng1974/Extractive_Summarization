by @entity0 published : 05:29 est , 8 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:31 est , 8 december 2013 care : a five - year - old girl was taken into care by social workers after her weight ballooned to more than 10 stone , at least three times what is expected of a healthy child a girl of five has been taken into care because she weighed more than 10 stone , it was revealed yesterday			1
the girl is one of the heaviest of her age ever recorded in the @entity16 and at her peak weight of 10st 10lbs , was more than three times the typical weight for a girl of five			1
yesterday experts criticised the failure to identify the youngster ’s problem earlier and said the authorities should do more to monitor obesity in pre-school years			2
details of the case were revealed through a @entity29 request , but the local authority refused to reveal more information for fear of identifying the child			1
it is not known whether any adults had been arrested over her care			2
the child , from @entity39 , @entity40 , was taken into care in august last year because she weighed 10st 5lbs			1
her weight increased to 10st 10lbs two months later , but dropped to below 8st this september			2
earlier this year it was revealed that more than 900 children , including 101 under - fives , had been admitted to hospital because of obesity in the past three years			1
@entity48 , of the @entity49 , said the @entity39 case highlighted the need for proper weight monitoring before children started primary school			1
he added : ‘ we are failing our children hugely by not monitoring their growth from a very early age			0
about 25 per cent of our primary school entrants are seriously overweight			0
’ commenting on the @entity39 case , he said he found it ‘ absolutely astounding ’ the problem was n’t picked up earlier			1
mr @entity48 added : ‘ she would have been out and about and all over the place			0
nursery school teachers will have seen her , probably she has been taken to the doctors several times , therefore the surgery staff and the doctor will have seen her			2
‘ it just throws up a whole problem of people wishing not to mention weight in case it upsets the parents or upsets the child			1
’ mr @entity48 added : ‘ this is the tip of the iceberg			0
there will be an enormous amount of children overweight , possibly dangerously overweight , where even the parents do n’t recognise it			0
’ @entity84 , a child protection consultant , said the @entity39 case was among the most extreme she had heard of in her 18 - year career			1
‘ i have never come across a five - year - old who weighs 10st , ’ she said			1
‘ why did n’t somebody do something sooner rather than picking it up at this stage ? ’ @entity92 , based in the @entity93 ( pictured ) in @entity39 , south @entity94 , made the decision to take the girl into care purely because if her obesity politicians in @entity39 called for answers about how the girl was allowed to get so fat			1
conservative councillor @entity102 said : ‘ it ’s a sad sign of the times			0
it ’s really terrible that a child can end up this way			0
‘ there are a lot of obese parents out there and their children are ending up exactly the same way			0
‘ there are other children in this sort of state – it ’s a ticking time bomb			0
a lot of people just think , “ i ’ll get a @entity122 tonight and @entity123 ’s tomorrow ”			0
they do n’t consider the consequences			0
’ a @entity92 spokesman said : ‘ the wellbeing of children and young people is of paramount importance and at the heart of all the work that is done by our children ’s services department			0
‘ it would be inappropriate to comment further on this case in the best interests of the child			2

girl was at least three times the weight of the average five - year - old
she is one of the heaviest five - year - old girls recorded in the @entity16
the girl was taken into care in @entity39 , south @entity94 , last year
she ' suffers from a *genetic* *condition* which causes *constant* *hunger* '
child protection experts have labelled the case ' a *tragedy* '
