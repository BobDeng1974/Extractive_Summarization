a plus size model who once lost seven stone to be industry thin now makes it big as a swimwear model after deciding to put the pounds back on embrace her curves			1
@entity8 , 34 , who lives in @entity9 but is originally from @entity10 , once embarked on a health kick that saw her lose seven stone in eight months			1
but her resulting health problems made her confidence plummet until she put more than half of the weight back on and moved to the @entity16			1
she has even entered a beauty pageant exclusively for larger ladies			2
the professional pianist , actress and singing teacher - who 's a celebrity in @entity10 - said : ' when i was smaller i looked in the mirror and what i saw looked gorgeous but inside i felt dead			2
' i had health problems and if i could turn back time i would never lose weight in such an extreme way again			1
i would try to live healthier and stay more positive about my looks , even it was hard to do			2
' now i feel more confident about myself every day			2
' having starred in @entity10 's most popular daily tv sketch comedy show , @entity8 was a huge celebrity in her home country and was recognised everywhere she went			1
but @entity8 hated her size 24 , 18 - stone frame , which was n't accepted in her country			1
@entity8 , who starred in a popular daily tv sketch comedy show and wass a huge celebrity in her home country , lost seven stone with free treatments in exchange for promoting an alternative health centre @entity8 said : ' in @entity10 it is not acceptable to be that size			1
they do n't even do clothes in sizes like 18 or 20 , let alone anything bigger			0
' i had to have my clothes made by a seamstress , which is n't always the best option			0
not every seamstress knew the specifics of plus - size clothing making , sewing large size bags instead of dresses			1

i stopped getting it because i was famous , but i got a lot of abuse before my tv career			2
' most men would n't date me because of my weight			2
even if he liked me a lot he 'd still be ashamed to introduce me to his friends			0
' while on a tv talk show @entity8 was approached by a health consultant who offered her free treatments in exchange for promoting an alternative health centre on talk shows and in the press			1
@entity8 agreed and went on a strict healthy diet according to her blood group , and had a number of body cleanses and lipomassages			1
she started losing the weight in september 2004 and in less than a year she had slimmed down to 10st 13lb and a size 8			1
@entity8 put almost half of the weight back on , especially when she went on tour with her band she said : ' in eight months i lost seven stone , but i had treatment on my skin to make sure it stayed taut			1
' i looked wonderful and i went on all the shows to talk about my weight loss and i was published on many well - known magazine covers , but it affected my health badly , especially my gall bladder and bile ducts which literally stopped working			1
' i had cramps down the right side of my body for 10 years , which made my singing career almost impossible			2
' i was studying opera , but the muscle in my vocal cords was very low in tone and i could n't hit the high notes			0
' i was so embarrassed			0
i could see the reaction in everyone 's eyes during my performance , thinking i could n't sing but i just did n't have any power left and there was nothing i could do			0
' something went wrong , even walking took it out of me and i would have to stop for rests			0
' and the slim results were not to last			0
@entity8 started putting some weight back on in 2006 , and finally stopped yo - yo - ing to plateau at her current weight of 15 stone , and she wears a size 18 to 20			1
when she started going to castings and signed her first contract she could n't believe it ' i 'm very lucky to do modelling and i always want to work hard to achieve the best results , ' she says she put just over three stone back on - almost half of the weight she originally lost - thanks to her convenience food habits especially when she went on tour with her band			1
shortly after , she moved to the @entity16 , where she was shocked by people 's positive attitudes			1
she said : ' in @entity141 people i did n't even know would come up to me and say i was gorgeous and pay me compliments , but my confidence was so low i did n't believe them			2
' i even went to an audition and the producer took one look at me , twirled me around joking and told me i was beautiful			0
i told him to get lost because i thought he was laughing at me because my confidence was so low			0
now i 'm not surprised i did n't get the job			0
' when some colleagues suggested i look into modelling i was very sceptical			0
when i started going to castings and signed my first contract i could n't believe it			0
' it took such a long time to start loving myself , but even now i am very demanding on myself and the people i work with , especially on photo - shoots			2
i 'm very lucky to do modelling and i always want to work hard to achieve the best results i am able to			0
' @entity8 has now reached the final of miss @entity162 , a competition exclusively for larger ladies			1
she said : ' i already knew @entity166 , who runs the competition , from the previous shoots we have done , and i started following her page on @entity171			0
' i did n't think i was going to enter and then i had a change of heart and sent off some head shots just before the closing date			0
' i am very happy to be where i am now , but i will never stop working on myself as it 's so far to go , achieving more and chasing my dreams			0
' i ca n't wait for the @entity178 finals			0
it 's every woman 's dream to at least once wear an amazing evening gown and to get attention on the stage			0
