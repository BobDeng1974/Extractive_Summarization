@entity0 will this week consider an £ 5million swoop for @entity3 striker @entity2			1
@entity4 wants to add to his forward line before the transfer deadline , and @entity2 is high on his list of options			1
@entity2 has been on @entity0 's radar for over 12 months , with former boss @entity10 interested in the forward during his time in the hotseat			2
the @entity25 club had been interested in @entity26 , but are not prepared to meet @entity27 's £ 20million asking price			0
@entity4 's interest in @entity31 forward @entity29 has cooled owing to the @entity34 international 's long - running battle to recover from a serious knee injury			0
a move for @entity2 may depend on moving players out of the club in the coming days			2
@entity4 wants to shift a number of players this month as he looks to free up money on his wage bill			1
@entity4 is one of the managers keen on getting @entity2 ' signature , and wants him at @entity0 they were successful in offloading @entity44 in @entity45 last week , recouping £ 5million			1
and they remain hopeful in trying to sell more players this month , with @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 all available			0
@entity3 manager @entity53 will want to keep his prized - asset until at least the end of the season			0
but with the striker 's contract due to expire in the summer , the club will find it hugely difficult to resist an substantial offer for @entity2 this month			0
because @entity2 is under 23 , @entity3 would receive a compensation fee , understood to be in the region of £ 3million , for the forward should he run down his contract			1
so any bid upward of that figure is likely to be considered by @entity3 .			0

@entity2 has scored seven times for the @entity3 already this season
