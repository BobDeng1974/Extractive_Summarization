by @entity0 the @entity1 has today revealed catastrophic losses of £ 2.5billion for the past year			1
acting chief executive @entity3 made a stark warning about the mutual 's future and admitted : ' 2013 was a disastrous year , the worst in our 150 - year history '			1
he added : ' this is a wake - up call that the co-op does not have a @entity12 - given right to exist			1
' the monumental losses follow the near - collapse of its banking arm , which had a £ 1.5billion black hole in its finances and nearly sank the whole group , which employs 90,000 staff in the @entity21			2
it came a day after the @entity23 's former chairman reverend @entity24 was charged with drugs offences			1
last month chief executive @entity33 quit the vast group , which has funeral , pharmacy , insurance , banking and a supermarket among its businesses , calling it a ' ungovernable '			1
his acting replacement @entity3 said as he revealed the vast losses : ' today ’s results demonstrate that but they also highlight fundamental failings in management and governance at the group over many years			2
' these results should serve as a wake - up call to anyone who doubts just how serious the challenges we face are '			1
former city minister @entity54 , who resigned from the group 's board last week , has blamed former managers ' who were allowed to run amok like kids in a sweet shop '			1
he was brought in to draw up proposals for a major overhaul of the business , but this was rejected			0
they may now be pushed through next month			0
' they bought up businesses willy - nilly - from @entity68 to @entity70 supermarkets - and made catastrophically inept decisions over and over again			2
in the process they crippled the group with huge debt , ' he said in the @entity77			0
criticism : experts have said the group , which includes the supermarket , is too big to led to safety by the current management the bulk of the losses relate to the crisis that engulfed the co-op 's banking arm when a £ 1.5 billion hole was discovered in its finances , following its ill - fated purchase of the @entity68 and attempts to buy more than 600 @entity94 branches			2
' like kids in a sweet shop ' : @entity54 blames former managers for the mutual 's current woes a rescue deal means the majority of the bank is now owned by bondholders though the co-op group remains the largest single shareholder with 30 per cent			1
but this stake may be further diluted after it said in today 's statement that it had still not decided whether to take part in a £ 400 million rights issue after the lender said it needed to find more cash than previously thought			2
the group said the cash call was an ' opportunity , not an obligation ' and that it would ' consider the full details of the issue in due course '			0
it will add to speculation about the possibility of the size of the group 's holding in the bank falling to such a low level that it may not be able to continue operating under the co-operative brand			0
@entity127 , director of corporate governance at the @entity129 said : ' @entity1 ’s problems have not arisen because co-op is a mutual organisation			1
they have arisen because co-op has weak corporate governance			0
' without major changes to its governance model , the @entity1 will struggle to survive over the medium term			2
this is a huge concern for the 90,000 people employed by the group '			0
one of its former bosses , disgraced reverend @entity24 , was yesterday charged with three drugs offences			1
the man dubbed the ‘ @entity151 ' , is accused of possession of @entity146 drugs cocaine and methamphetamine as well as the @entity149 drug ketamine			0
arriving at a police station to answer bail , he told the assembled reporters and photographers that they were ‘ vultures ’			0
but said the exception was the @entity159 – which had always been ‘ really nice ’ to him			0
on bail : reverend @entity24 arrives at a @entity163 police station flanked by minders as he was charged with drugs offences today @entity166 chairman @entity24 laughs as he tries out an exercise bike anger : flowers called waiting journalists ' vultures ' but said the @entity159 had been ' very nice ' since the scandal broke last year today 's figures showed the co-op 's vast debt pile , built up during an acquisition spree which included the @entity70 supermarket chain , stood at £ 1.4 billion			1
this was down from £ 1.7billion in 2012 , but comes as lenders are reported to be increasingly troubled by the run of boardroom disputes hampering plans to shake up the group 's corporate structure			2
bitter resistance to the planned changes saw chief executive @entity33 step down last month while former city minister @entity54 , architect of the reforms , will also leave after putting them to a members ' vote in may			1
group chair @entity192 used today 's results announcement to stress the urgent need for change			0
' during 2013 , it became apparent that our governance had fallen far short of the standards to which we aspire as a co-operative society			0
' now is the time to put that right through fundamental reform - we have to act with urgency if we are to lay the foundations for a stronger , healthier co-operative business in the future			0

acting chief executive believes ' disastrous ' 2013 is ' worst in our history '
@entity3 says it is ' wake - up call ' for those doubting failures
@entity54 resigned because member refused to accept reforms
managers ' were allowed to run amok like kids in a sweet shop ' , he said
@entity129 says that @entity1 may not survive the crisis
@entity23 's former chairman , @entity24 , charged with drugs offences
