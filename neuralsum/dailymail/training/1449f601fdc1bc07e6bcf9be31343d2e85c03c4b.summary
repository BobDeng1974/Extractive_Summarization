by @entity0 published : 17:07 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 05:20 est , 13 february 2013 describing @entity2 as a ‘ quivering jelly ’ bullied into taking speeding points for her cabinet minister husband @entity5 was ‘ to stop living in the real world ’ , it was claimed yesterday			1
she was in fact a ‘ powerful , intelligent woman ’ and her claims that she was coerced by @entity5 into perverting the course of justice were ‘ bare - faced lies ’ , @entity8 heard			1
as her trial drew to its close , prosecutor @entity16 accused the economist of being a ‘ manipulative and deceitful ’ woman who conjured up a ‘ stage - managed performance ’ for the court			2
' utterly humiliated ' : @entity2 , the former wife of ex-mp @entity5 arrived at @entity8 on tuesday , where the court heard details of @entity5 's affair by contrast , @entity2 ’s defence counsel @entity26 presented her as a loyal wife who had been humiliated by her husband ’s affair with his assistant , @entity31 , and then effectively given no choice but to accept his speeding points			1
he said @entity5 used the lesbian public profile of his assistant – who had previously been in a civil partnership with a woman – to ‘ allay the suspicions ’ of his wife that she was his mistress , it was claimed yesterday			1
jurors were told @entity2 was left ‘ utterly humiliated ’ when the @entity43 mp left her for his @entity45 adviser and manager of his campaign to lead his party , former energy secretary @entity5 , right , allegedly used his the lesbian past of his mistress @entity31 , left , to lull his wife into a false sense of security about their relationship @entity26 , @entity55 , defending @entity2 , said the affair attracted ‘ salacious ’ attention and urged jurors to consider how they would feel if their marriage was ‘ put under the microscope ’ and ‘ laughed at ’			1
@entity2 , 60 , admits accepting @entity5 ’s speeding points in 2003 but pleads not guilty to perverting the course of justice on the grounds of marital coercion – meaning that her husband left her with ‘ no real choice ’ but to commit the crime			1
summing up the case against her , however , mr @entity69 said : ‘ you are not talking about a woman who is under the thumb of anybody			2
you are talking about someone who has had a brilliant career because throughout she has made good decisions			0
‘ to describe such a person as being deprived of real choice is to stop living in the real world			0
’ disgraced @entity43 dem @entity5 , with his new partner @entity31 , faced the media outside @entity8 this month career in tatters : philandering ex-mp @entity5 leaving @entity8 over allegations that he coerced his ex-wife into taking his penalty points on her driving licence she claims @entity5 bullied her into action because it was crucial to him winning his party ’s nomination for the relatively safe @entity43 seat of @entity96			1
mr @entity69 told the jury of eight women and four men : ‘ in a sense she is trying to pervert the course of justice again , but this time by fooling you			0
’ he added : ‘ these are bare - faced lies designed to give a false impression about her			0
she is not a vulnerable , weak person , she is very clever			0
’ mr @entity69 said she was driven by revenge after @entity5 left her for @entity109			1
he said she had supported him in his bid to become an mp and through two attempts to claim leadership of his party			0
he added : ‘ if what has happened to him had not happened he would probably be deputy prime minister now			0
’ the court was told @entity2 wanted to strike at @entity5 ‘ from a very safe distance ’ by planting the stories of his deception in the newspapers without identifying herself			1
but when that failed she turned to ‘ @entity121 ’ , which was to claim she was coerced into helping him and therefore not guilty of a crime			0
the court heard that swapping the speeding points was a ‘ useful family arrangement ’ and benefited both @entity5 and @entity2			1
@entity5 was working as an mep and was often away from home and @entity2 wanted him to win a seat in @entity130			2
she was struggling to juggle her family and work roles and if he lost his licence she would have to ‘ chauffeur ’ him around			0
mr @entity69 accused @entity2 of making up her claim that @entity5 forced her to sign the speeding summons by confronting her with a pen in his hand			2
he said : ‘ do you think there is any prospect of this woman having been reduced to such a quivering jelly when she sent the form – that she had no real choice ? ’ mr @entity26 said that if the jury considered the evidence properly they would find her ‘ obviously not guilty ’			2
he said she was put in an ‘ impossible situation ’ by her husband and had ‘ no realistic choice ’ but to sign the form and take the points			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
