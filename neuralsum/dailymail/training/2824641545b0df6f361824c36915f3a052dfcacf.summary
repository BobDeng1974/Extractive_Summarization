by @entity0 published : 19:13 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 19:55 est , 10 january 2014 fewer than 10 days into his term as @entity5 mayor and @entity6 is already defending himself after his first scandal : being caught eating his pizza with a knife and fork			1
a photograph of @entity6 using utensils spread across @entity13 and prompted mock outrage among @entity5 on blogs and news sites			1
responding to the pizza palaver , @entity6 defended the approach , saying that his @entity20 ancestry is behind his decidedly @entity22 - eating style			1
put a fork in him : @entity6 earned the disapproval of @entity5 when he ate a slice with a knife and fork at @entity28 , @entity29 ' in my ancestral homeland it is more typical to eat with a fork and knife			1
and i have been in @entity35 a lot and i ’ve picked up the habit for certain types of pizza , ' he said			0
it 's a method @entity5 have variously described as ' blasphemous , ' a ' cardinal sin , ' and ' unacceptable ' on @entity13			1
as any @entity5 knows , the preferred method for eating a slice of pizza is to fold it in half and eat it with your hands			1
the incident , already dubbed ' @entity51 , ' happened at @entity29 pizza joint @entity28 friday , where @entity6 stopped in for lunch with local business owners			1
the owner of @entity28 , which was a favorite spot of former mayor @entity57 , was n't sold on the mayor 's method either			2
' i think he ’s just trying to be polite , ' @entity60 said			0
' we ’ll talk to him on the side about that , ' he added			0
hand it to him : @entity6 did eventually pick up his slice proving he is not a complete heathen , though , @entity6 explained that he likes to use his hands too			2
his method is a combination of the @entity20 and @entity5 styles , he said , describing it as ' very complicated			2
' ' i often start with a knife and fork			2
but then i cross over to the @entity76 approach and pick it up when i go farther into the pizza , ' he told a reporter who questioned his methods , adding that the inquiry was a ' very important question			2
' @entity83 witnessed the incident and is not letting his longstanding friendship with the mayor get in the way of what 's right			0
one of us : conservative pals @entity90 and @entity92 made news in 2011 when they stepped out of @entity90 's presumably gold - plated apartment in @entity90 tower for a slice of pizza and proceeded to use a knife and fork the @entity76 way : both @entity101 and @entity102 would win approval from @entity5 with their pizza approach he told the @entity106 he loved having @entity6 in his home borough but could not approve of his genteel pizza - eating			1
' no , ' he told @entity106			0
' no. it 's blasphemy			0
' relenting a little , he added , ' he 's from @entity111			0
he does n't know any better			0
' for the record , @entity6 ate three slices of smoked mozzarella and sausage pie .			0

mayor @entity6 had lunch at @entity118 in @entity29 on friday *afternoon*
he was photographed eating his pizza with a knife and fork
@entity13 users *expressed* faux *horror* at the method after the picture went viral , with some using the *hashtag* ' **#** *forkgate* ' and others the more *dramatic* ' **#** *impeach* '
@entity133 defended his methods as *traditionally* @entity20 and says he begins with a knife and fork and then picks up his slice later
