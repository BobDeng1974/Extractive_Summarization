join @entity3 for minute - by - minute coverage from @entity5 as @entity8 host @entity6 at the @entity9			1
@entity10 made his debut for the @entity13 giants in the defeat to @entity15 last week , and will hope for a positive result on his home bow			1
@entity8 can leapfrog @entity15 to top the table once again with a victory against a @entity6 side that have impressed this season and lie in sixth			1
host commentator host commentator @entity10 's home debut ends in defeat and he has lost his first two @entity8 matches			1
the new tremendous front three has not worked out well so far ! well that 's all from me folks			0
thanks for tuning in ! good night ! well , that game was quite incredible			0
@entity8 had tens of chances - and on another day @entity32 , @entity10 and @entity33 would each have had hat - tricks - but they have lost 1 - 0 at home to @entity6			1
@entity6 put in a phenomenal shift and , thanks to a goal from @entity39 and some magnificent shot - stopping from @entity40 , they ensure @entity8 remain third in the table behind @entity15 and @entity42			1
@entity10 must have thought he had scored a goal on his home debut , but @entity40 had other ideas			1
after @entity10 received the ball in the middle of the box he smashes a shot across the goal and @entity40 dives well to his right and gets a massive hand to it to turn it around the post			1
the substitute @entity56 receives the ball on his chest , facing away from goal and 10 yards out			1
he does two keep - ups , flicks it over @entity63 and then tries to chip it over @entity65 who makes the save			1
that would have been a wondergoal			0
@entity8 have hit the woodwork four times in this game now			1
@entity32 takes a free - kick from 25 yards which whips and curls before rattling the very top - right hand corner of the goalframe			1
how have they not scored ? @entity6 are still looking dangerous on the counter attack and @entity80 nearly doubles the lead			1
he receives a cross and volleys the ball at @entity65 who saves low , only for substitute charles to hit the rebound over the bar			2
very wasteful from @entity32 who whips the free - kick high and wide from the edge of the area			2
@entity90 is a bit unlucky because it seems he got the ball but he has given away a free - kick on the edge of the box and gotten booked in the process			2
@entity10 and @entity33 perform a one - two and @entity90 hauls the former down			1
it really has the feeling that it might be one of those days			0
@entity8 have had a ridiculous number of chances and @entity40 has made countless saves			1
this time @entity105 crosses to @entity10 who , along with two other @entity8 players , is completely unmarked in the box but he heads straight into @entity40 's hands			1
large swathes of the @entity9 sit in quiet bemusement			0
this was not what the home unveiling of the @entity33 attacking trident was meant to be like			2
it is quite incredible that they have n't scored yet but @entity8 are behind			2
@entity32 whips a corner in but it is easily cleared and @entity118 needs to make some changes here			2
@entity40 does make a good save with his foot from @entity32 though			1
@entity32 whips in a free - kick from the left - hand side and @entity123 does well to nod it out for a corner			1
@entity8 are getting a bit desperate now , but they have missed countless chances already			1
awful defending from @entity128 , who does not get rid of the ball and @entity80 does a wonderful backheel			1
@entity131 loses the run of @entity39 and he sticks the ball into the bottom right - hand corner			2
@entity8 have been wasteful but @entity6 have also looked quite solid at times			2
yes , the home side could have had four or five , but @entity136 and @entity137 have been particularly good for the visitors			2
@entity139 breaks down the left and he passes the ball square to @entity33 who is only eight yards out			2
his finish is quite lethargic though and the ball hits the bar and goes over once more			0
a goal must come soon ... surely ... surely it 's only a matter of time before one of @entity8 's star strikers score because they simply have too much quality not to find the back of the net soon			2
expect @entity8 to go full throttle after the break			2
the @entity10 , @entity32 , @entity33 front three has burst into life in fits and starts but there 's more to come and the crowd knows it			1
no whistles at half - time , which is rare - if @entity8 are n't winning , there 's normally a few complaints			2
@entity33 has been denied again			2
the @entity167 is clean through on goal and puts a shot across the keeper but @entity40 does brilliantly to tip it wide of the post			2
@entity40 has been on top , top form here			2
he has shown glimpses @entity10 but he has still not reached the heights of last season as he recovers his fitness			2
the @entity179 hits a left - footed shot from just outside the area and @entity40 does well to dive to his left and save it			0
@entity6 have had to endure a bombardment of attacks but they have also offered some threat themselves			0
@entity80 is making a nuisance of himself and @entity39 has also been decent , with @entity188 and @entity90 offering some threat in the air too			1
both sides have had chances and @entity32 in particular you would have expected to have scored by now			1
he has had at least three opportunities , as has @entity33 , and yet neither have found the back of the net			0
@entity32 has had another glorious chance and how has the ball not gone in ? @entity33 threads his team - mate through and he round the keeper before sliding the ball towards goal and @entity123 slides in			1
the ball seems destined for the back of the net but @entity123 clears it off the line and on to the crossbar			0
@entity33 does brilliantly and he cuts the ball back for @entity32 , who curls a shot towards goal			1
the effort has pace and @entity40 in the @entity6 goal does brilliantly to tip it over and wide for a corner			0
@entity8 supporters chant @entity118 's name , a show of support , despite the club 's humbling at the hands of arch - rivals @entity15 last weekend			0
@entity33 should have had a hat - trick but @entity188 has come close from a corner			1
@entity6 are looking decent here and from set pieces they look extremely dangerous			0
disappointing from @entity10 , who messes up his central pass in a good attacking area ... @entity6 then break but @entity80 's effort deflects into @entity65 's hands			1
as usual in the 17th minute the crowd chant for independence			0
it 's louder than usual today , as we approach the date which the ( now cancelled ) referendum had been set for			0
the crowd here have seen @entity10 once before , in a cameo role at the end of a pre-season friendly			0
now they 're getting the real deal and there 's an electricity in the atmosphere when he gets on the ball			0
that said , it 's been @entity33 who has come the closest to scoring			0
@entity6 are given a free - kick 20 yards out in a great area			0
@entity80 breaks free and @entity252 just catches him ... @entity80 , the former @entity8 player , steps up ... but it 's well over the bar			1
he should have done better , getting well underneath it			0
yellow card for @entity188 after a collision in mid-air with @entity131			0
not sure why ... but the referee seems to think he 's elbowed the @entity261 midfielder			0
replays show he did n't ... but good old @entity263 is making the most of it			0
chance ! @entity33 could have had a hat - trick already ... the @entity167 curls a pearler from 20 yards but hits the bar and goes clear			0
great effort , surely a goal is just around the corner			0
chance ! @entity6 clear a free - kick but @entity274 whips in a delightful ball from the left ... @entity33 is unmarked but his header is straight at @entity40 from eight yards			1
good chance wasted again by @entity8 's top scorer			0
chance ! @entity10 twists and turns and plays a great ball into @entity33 inside the area ... the @entity167 takes a touch when he really does n't need to			1
it brings him away from goal and @entity6 recover			0
the visitors already split open and @entity8 are pressing well			0
@entity274 releases @entity10 down the left wing , but his cross is too deep and picked up by @entity290 near the touchline			1
his pull - back does n't reach @entity293 and goalkeeper @entity40 collects			0
@entity8 have n't let @entity6 have a touch as yet , as you 'd expect			0
the visitors are sixth in @entity5 , with 16 points , eight off leaders @entity15			0
@entity118 needs a performance after the @entity301 defeat , and will it come against his former side ? ' an air of anticipation at the @entity9 with @entity10 set to make his home debut			0
' but with all eyes on the @entity179 could @entity32 take his thunder by netting two and overtaking @entity309 as @entity5 's all time top goalscorer ? ' and welcome to @entity3 's live coverage of @entity8 vs @entity6 at the @entity9			1
@entity15 hit four earlier on , now we 'll see how @entity118 's side can react			0
here are your teams , and it will be @entity10 's home debut for @entity8			1
