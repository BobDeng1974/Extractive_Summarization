gen. @entity8 , who chairs the military @entity9 , said ' i am fearful that @entity5 will fall			1
' forces fighting for the self - declared @entity3 have pressed their way ' into the city itself , ' he told @entity15			2
' it may be about to fall			0
' and @entity8 said he has ' no doubt ' that @entity3 will inflict ' horrific atrocities ' on any civilians still in the town ' if they have the opportunity to do so			1
' they 've got forces on their side of the border that will prevent @entity3 from making any incursions into @entity7 , ' he said , using the @entity45 administration 's preferred alternative name for the genocidal group			1
' but , of course , ' he predicted , the terror army ' is smart enough not to do that			2
' @entity3 has engaged in a coordinated assault on @entity5 for the past three weeks , driving countless @entity52 refugees out and killing an estimated 400 - plus @entity53 as it consolidated its gains			1
if it should manage to take the city , @entity3 would control most of the border region in northern @entity6			1
@entity1 - led airstrikes , at least a dozen so far according to the @entity61 , have failed to prevent the terror group 's advance , and @entity7 president @entity27 said tuesday that @entity5 was ' about to fall			1
' the prospect that the town could be captured by @entity66 , who are now within city limits , has increased pressure on @entity7 to join an international coalition to fight against the jihadists			1
@entity7 is feeling pressure to finally join the international coalition battling @entity3 now that the battle is on its doorstep			1
' it is our view , ' @entity75 press secretary @entity74 told reporters tuesday aboard @entity80 , ' that there is a clear interest that @entity7 has in working with the international coalition – or international community – to deal with the threat that 's posed by @entity3			1
' @entity8 said hours later that the @entity1 and its allies were finding it more and more difficult to track the increasingly technologically adept @entity3 forces			1

... they do n't establish headquarters that are visible or identifiable			0

the @entity75 , @entity74 said , is ' very concerned about the safety of individuals – of citizens , of innocent civilians ' in @entity5			0
' we are seeing this extremist organization , in the name of an otherwise peaceful religion , @entity116 , perpetrating terrible acts of violence against religious and ethnic minorities , ' @entity74 said			0
' this is something that we remain concerned about			0
' @entity7 said it was pressing @entity123 for more airstrikes , although president @entity27 said bombings by themselves would not be sufficient to defeat @entity3			1
he set out @entity7 's demands for additional measures before his own country would intervene			1
' the problem of @entity3 ... can not be solved via air bombardment , ' @entity27 said			2
' right now ... @entity5 is about to fall			2
' ' we had warned the @entity133			0
no - fly zone , a secure zone parallel to that , and the training of moderate @entity6 rebels , ' he said			2
@entity27 claimed @entity7 would take action if there were threats to @entity7 soldiers guarding a historic site in @entity6 that @entity107 regards as its territory			1
but so far @entity7 has made no move to get involved in fighting across the border			2
@entity1 secretary of state @entity151 and @entity7 prime minister @entity152 have spoken twice in recent days to discuss the situation , @entity150 spokeswoman @entity149 said			2
' @entity7 is determining what larger role they will play , ' she said during a daily briefing			0
' they have indicated their openness to doing that , so there is an active conversation about that			0
' get involved : many want @entity7 to join the international coalition trying to stop @entity3 as they get closer to the country 's border , leading to protests in the country ( above ) @entity171 @entity6 envoy @entity170 said @entity7 had been generous in receiving refugees from @entity5 but the international community needed to protect the town			1
' what is needed now is concrete action , ' he said , without elaborating			0
@entity177 said it was vital to stop @entity66 's advance on @entity5 , and was discussing with @entity7 what could be done			1
' a tragedy is unfolding , and we must all react , ' foreign minister @entity181 told parliament			0
but some analysts doubt the will exists among @entity188 allies to take further action			0
' it 's the coalition of the unwilling , each country is doing the bare minimum , particularly in @entity6 , ' said @entity193 at the @entity195 - based think tank @entity194			1
from across the @entity7 border , two @entity66 flags could be seen flying over the eastern side of @entity199			2

@entity66 , an @entity240 offshoot , has ramped up its offensive in recent days against the mainly @entity52 border town , despite being targeted by @entity1 - led coalition air strikes aimed at halting its progress			1

not heavy , but @entity3 is going forward from the southwest			0
they have crossed into @entity5 and control some buildings in the city there , ' said @entity251 , head of the @entity252 , a group that monitors the conflict with a network on the ground			2
