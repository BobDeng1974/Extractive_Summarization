i think it ’s such a good institution it should be available to gay people as well as heterosexuals			2

' ' of course the gay marriage issue has been divisive and i totally respect those who take a different opinion			2
' i do n’t think in any way that to oppose gay marriage to be wrong - headed or bigoted			2
this is a different point of view but we should respect each other , ' he told @entity133 's today programme			2

mr @entity0 was forced to interrupt a visit to the @entity192 to rush out a draft bill legislating to stage an in - out vote in an attempt to placate his critics who want a tougher line on @entity25			1
in a sign of concern that he is being buffeted by @entity172 , in the way that @entity202 's government unraveled in the 1990s , mr @entity0 was forced to state publicly that he would not be pressured into changing his @entity25 policy			1

mr @entity0 claimed there was ' incredible unity and agreement ' in the @entity4 party and the wider country on @entity25			1
and he boasted that he had the ' boldest , clearest , most straightforward policy on @entity25 that any party leader has had for 30 or 40 years '			0
' the conservative party managed to have a disagreement over the last couple of weeks about an issue that we actually agree about – that there should be a renegotiation , there should be a referendum			0
' now all we need to do is focus on the substance of the policy , and the substance of the policy – a renegotiation , a referendum – is backed by the overwhelming majority of the @entity150 people , because it ’s the right thing to do			0
' after weeks of turmoil both mr @entity0 and deputy prime minister @entity253 today vowed that the coalition would last until 2015 deputy prime minister @entity253 today used a highly - combative speech to warn the warring @entity4 it must ‘ get back to governing ’			1
he said @entity4 infighting over @entity25 and gay marriage has been an ‘ unwelcome distraction ’ which is undermining public support for the government			1
