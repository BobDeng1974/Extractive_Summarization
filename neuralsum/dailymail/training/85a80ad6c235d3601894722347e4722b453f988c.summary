' @entity7 was competing for just the third time since his return to the @entity19 less than a year ago			1
having finally found a weight division to suit , the @entity41 upset @entity42 with a unanimous points win in @entity45			1
he followed that up with a stunning 44 - second knockout of @entity48 three months later			2
but @entity0 was expected to provide an altogether tougher challenge			1
the @entity12 came agonisingly close to dethroning @entity18 in what was one of the best fights in @entity19 history in 2013			1
and after a second - round victory over @entity55 @entity54 last march , @entity0 was set for his rematch with @entity18 in september only for a knee injury to rule him out			1
while @entity18 would go on to beat @entity58 in @entity59 at the turn of the year , @entity0 prepared for an emotional homecoming at the magnificent @entity29 in @entity30			1
@entity7 's power was evident from the early stages as he rocked @entity0 before going in for the finish it was @entity7 's right hand which did the damage and @entity0 could not recover his senses @entity7 sensed he had @entity0 in trouble and made sure he made no mistake in finishing the job @entity0 had hoped to set up a rematch with light - heavyweight champion @entity18 with a victory but his dreams of another title shot are now in tatters after @entity7 's explosive performance			1

' man this fight 's going to be awesome			2
' @entity18 is currently dealing with the fall - out from testing positive for cocaine a month before his clash with @entity58 but is expected to return later in the year			1
' i 'll be the hardest puncher he 's ever faced and he 's faced a lot of top quality guys , ' @entity7 said			1
' hopefully i can do things to him that no - one has ever done to him			2
' @entity0 gave him the worst beating he 's had and hopefully i can give him one 10 times as bad			1
' it did n't seem real			2
i could n't believe i stopped the guy who , in my opinion , beat @entity18			1
no - one has ever stopped @entity0 like that before and i was just speechless			1
' @entity7 lands a kick on @entity0 as he takes complete control of the light - heavyweight showdown @entity0 made his entrance into the arena cheered on by 30,000 of his countrymen in @entity30 @entity0 lands a shot on @entity7 but it proved to be a rare success before he was taken apart @entity7 was in only his third fight in the division since returning to the @entity19 early last year @entity0 was subjected to a long punishment on the canvas as he failed to defend himself adequetly @entity7 ( right ) celebrates after his stunning performance against @entity0 in @entity30 @entity0 sits slumped on his stool after suffering his second defeat in three fights @entity0 , meanwhile , was still emotional sometime after the fight had ended			1

' earlier , in the co-main event , @entity125 suffered a controversial defeat to @entity128			0
@entity125 , fighting at middleweight for the first time in more than five years , was dropped in the first round and the fight was stopped quickly ; perhaps prematurely			2
@entity125 , who appeared at the post-fight press conference wearing a patch over his left eye , said : ' i got hit and i could n't see very well out of my left eye			0
he just clipped me a little bit			0
but i was aware of what it the whole time , you know			0
but it ’s not his fault , he is a good guy			0
' @entity128 , who bounced back from a defeat to @entity146 in september , said : ' i feel good			0
i like @entity125 but of course i ’m happy and pleased that i won			0
it was a good victory			0
@entity128 punches @entity125 as he recorded a first - round victory in their middleweight clash @entity128 dropped @entity125 and pounced quickly to end the fight with a barrage of blows on the canvas ' i thought it was a good stoppage			1
right when he went down , i would have been able to put another punch in it but i did n’t because i thought the referee would stop it			0
' and then i thought , well maybe they are n't going to stop it , so i kept punching afterwards			0
so i think it was a good stoppage			0
' in another potentially pivotal fight in the light - heavyweight division , @entity163 won a split - decision victory over @entity42 after three tentative rounds			1
' it was a split decision but i walked out with a win so i ’m happy , ' @entity163 said			0
' performance wise , i felt like i was a bit sloppy at times			0
he ’s obviously a really good wrestler			0
his stand up is just sporadic			0
' at the end of the day , i came out of there with a win and i got the job done			0
now , back to training – try to sharpen up those skills			0
who knows what ’s next ? ' i needed to get over that hump of beating one of those top five guys , so i ’ll just go on from there			0
i ’ve fought the who ’s who of @entity187 so whoever is next , whatever is next , let ’s just do it			0
' @entity163 lands a right hand on @entity42 on his way to a split - decision victory in @entity30 @entity163 was announced as the winner after a nervous wait following three tentative rounds against @entity42			2
