it was a chance for @entity58 , who has been identified by @entity59 as a potential replacement for @entity43 , but he lasted just 18 minutes and , as @entity61 lined up a kick to level the scores , @entity52 was given a rousing reception by the sell - out crowd			1
@entity4 knew that a powerful start would silence the @entity0 audience and a scuffed 25th - minute penalty by @entity69 was a let - off			1
assisted by a defence - splitting kick from @entity71 , @entity4 were able to clear their lines and move play into opposition territory			0
the scrum looked unconvincing on a churning pitch but , with the skills of @entity78 at the base , still provided a platform to attack			0
rather than crash through the middle , the ball went out wide to @entity84 off first phase and @entity6 conceded a penalty at the subsequent breakdown			2
with his usual pinpoint accuracy , @entity10 took full advantage of the three points			0

his half - back partner and club team - mate , @entity132 , takes the kicks for @entity151 but the scrum - half too was off target when he took over the duties			0
they attacked the @entity13 line through @entity157 , but again left empty handed after play was called back for crossing			0
@entity4 fell foul of the law soon after when @entity127 failed to roll away from the tackle and @entity6 drew level with @entity69 ’s kick			2
when @entity6 collapsed a driving maul , @entity10 was able to edge his team back in front with the kick			2
then @entity84 , becoming the youngest ever player to reach 50 caps , broke through the defence and @entity105 was allowed to snipe down the side of the breakdown			0

@entity10 missed the conversion but he was on hand with a penalty shortly after to give his side an 11 - point cushion			1
@entity176 crossed in the 67th minute but , despite a fine conversion from @entity69 , it was to be @entity4 ’ night as @entity10 kept the scoreboard ticking			1
@entity84 gets among the action as two @entity21 team up to take him down on a typically powerful run from the man on the right wing @entity43 ( left ) and @entity203 ( right ) both try to evade @entity21 tackles although the latter looks headed for the ground @entity6 flanker @entity207 tries to release the ball to a team - mate after being tackled as @entity4 held firm to the @entity21 attacks the @entity13 pack engage in a scrum as they held out for a victory to really bring themselves back on track in the championship @entity176 goes over for a @entity21 try to close the gap and , despite a brilliant successful conversion , they could not quite catch @entity4 the @entity13 players celebrate victory at the full - time whistle in @entity0 while the defeated @entity21 players look dejected with their defeat			1
