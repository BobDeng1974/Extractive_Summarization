by @entity0 published : 17:48 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 17:55 est , 21 june 2013 researchers at the @entity2 have developed a breakthrough in engineering technology that allows a robot to successfully achieve the complex aerobatic maneuvers of a bird			1
the artificial bird is destined to have a military or surveillance purpose , the @entity8 , which sits within the @entity2 , has received funding from the @entity13			1
the robot bird has the potential to become a more advanced type of drone , it includes a tiny video camera and could be used for reconnaissance and surveillance			1
researchers at the @entity2 have developed a breakthrough in engineering technology that allows a robot to successfully achieve the complex aerobatic maneuvers of a bird the robot bird includes a tiny video camera and could be used for reconnaissance and surveillance by the army ' @entity29 ' is much quieter than the helicopter or propeller , so it could get much closer to an adversary without revealing its presence			1
it is made out of carbon fiber , 3d - printed lightweight thermal - resistant plastic , @entity37 foil and foam and weighs less than a can of soda			0
the bird uses one motor to flap both wings together in simple motions			0
robot birds have been a labor of love for @entity2 professor @entity49 for nearly a decade			0
the ' @entity29 ' is made out of carbon fiber , 3d - printed lightweight thermal - resistant plastic , @entity37 foil and foam and weighs less than a can of soda along with fellow mechanical engineering professor @entity55 and their graduate students , @entity49 first successfully demonstrated a flapping - wing bird in 2007			2
by 2010 , the design had evolved through four successive models to the latest , which carries a tiny video camera			0
' nobody has flown anything with independent wing control , ' before , @entity49 told the @entity66 it can also be launched from a ground robot that @entity13 researchers have created called the @entity70 , which can fly in winds up to 10 mph			2
from a distance , the ' @entity29 ' looks like a bird and it has even fooled a hawk , which has attacked the robot in mid-flight on more than one occasion			0

the ' @entity29 ' is a lightweight advanced robot that can fly like a bird
it has been developed by searchers at the @entity2 and received funding from the @entity13
has the potential to be used as a drone for reconnaissance and surveillance
