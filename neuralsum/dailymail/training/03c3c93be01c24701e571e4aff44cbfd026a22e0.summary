by @entity0 published : 10:14 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 10:14 est , 11 july 2012 @entity1 has quietly removed a highly controversial @entity3 game which portrayed @entity5 ninjas and sumo wrestlers attacking disputed islands in the @entity8			1
the game , ' defend the @entity10 ' disappeared from the @entity11 this week , reportedly due to its political and racial content			0
the game refers to islands which are the subject of a heated dispute over ownership between the two countries - and the racially charged game would have served to inflame the conflict			1
the game , ' defend the @entity10 ' disappeared from the @entity11 this week , reportedly due to its political and racial content @entity1 normally polices what can be released very strictly , removing apps that contain nudity or other offensive material			2
' jew or not jew ' - ' @entity28 ' in @entity29 , which allowed users to find out whether @entity29 celebrities were @entity32 , was removed by @entity1 last year			0
@entity33 lodged a protest with @entity3 on wednesday against the entry of @entity3 patrol ships into waters near disputed islands in the @entity8 , an issue that has long been a cause of friction between @entity42 's two biggest economies			1
@entity43 said that the game violated an @entity11 policy which stated that games , ' can not target a specific race , culture , real government or corporation or any other real entity			0
' @entity1 has not provided any reason as to why the game has disappeared from the @entity11			0
chief cabinet secretary @entity54 said three @entity3 fishery patrol ships entered waters near the uninhabited islands , known as @entity10 in @entity33 and @entity10 in @entity3			0
the islands , claimed by @entity59 and @entity60 as well as @entity61 , are located near rich fishing grounds and potentially huge oil and gas reserves			0
@entity33 said last week it was considering a plan to buy the islands from private landowners instead of letting the nationalist governor of @entity60 go ahead with a similar plan , a move diplomatic experts said may have been intended to dampen tensions but which risked backfiring and sending @entity5 ties into a deep chill			1
@entity1 's @entity76 is rigidly policed - @entity1 vet everything sold through it ' it is clear that the @entity10 islands are inherently @entity5 territory from a historical point of view and in terms of international law and that they are under the effective control of @entity33 , ' @entity54 told a news conference			1
the three @entity3 ships later left the waters , with @entity5 patrol ships keeping close watch .			2
