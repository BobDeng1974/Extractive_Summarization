the @entity0 , a watchdog department created in 2011 to create a level financial playing field for @entity3 consumers , has scrapped its internal employee performance review process following revelations that nonunion workers and caucasians routinely scored better than unionized employees and minorities in 2013			1
the annual performance reviews award scores on a scale from 1 to 5 and are closely tied to salary raises , bonuses and career advancement			1
instead of keeping the scores in place , agency leaders have decided to award all of their 1,100 employees ratings of ' 5			1
' an internal @entity0 report released this month found that ' the average ratings for black and @entity23 employees were lower than the average ratings for white and @entity26 employees			1
' @entity27 to read the report racial disparities ? president @entity30 chose former ohio attorney general @entity31 ( r ) to lead the @entity0 in 2012 , but he now presides over a bureaucracy that appears to have un-leveled its internal playing field the average score for white employees last year was 3.94 , while the average was 3.81 for @entity36 , 3.69 for @entity37 and 3.63 for blacks			1
unionized employees scored an average of 3.79 , while their nonunion counterparts scored 4.04			1
' our performance ratings system did not meet our own objectives and expectations , ' the report read in part			1
' the analyses we undertook found statistically significant disparities indicating that employees were more likely to receive higher or lower overall performance ratings based on their race , age , pay grade , bargaining unit membership eligibility , tenure or whether they worked within the agency			1
for these reasons , we have decided to revisit our approach to our performance management program			2
' in an e-mail to all employees obtained by the @entity65 newspaper , @entity0 director @entity31 claimed there ' was no single factor that caused this result			2
' ' we have determined that there were broad - based disparities in the way performance ratings were assigned across our employee base in both 2012 and 2013 , ' @entity31 wrote			1
' these differences indicate a systemic disadvantage to various categories of employees			0
' in order to correct those ' disadvantages , ' the agency has ' remediated ' the compensation of employees , other than senior managers , who received overall performance scores of 3 or 4 during either of the last two years			2
instead of the result of their evaluations , they will be paid as though they had received a grade of 5			2
' everyone â€™s a winner ! ' quipped @entity94 writer @entity93			0
' only rather than a trophy , everyone gets cash money			0
welcome to cloud - cuckoo land			0
' ' hard - working , conscientious workers ( and , yes , the federal government does have those ) deserve to be treated better and paid more than workers who , say , persistently show up late and turn in shoddy work , ' he added			0
' instead , in its pathetic bow to political correctness , the slackers are being rewarded			0
' @entity31 has presided over an agency that an outside investigator said was full of ' exclusion , retaliation , discrimination , nepotism , demoralization , devaluation and other offensive working conditions ' silence : @entity120 @entity119 sen. @entity118 ( r ) was the agency 's first chief , serving as ' special adviser ' during its creation -- she has been quiet about her former bureau 's problems the @entity126 reported that the latest embarrassment for the @entity0 comes just one day before its senior managers will deliver subpoenaed testimony to @entity130 , addressing reports of retaliatory discrimination against some employees			1
hearings and subpoenas , however , came in response to complaints from a white attorney employed by the agency who said she experienced that sort of bias			0
' sadly , my story is not unique , ' @entity143 testified in april			0
' my colleagues likewise have suffered and are suffering at the hands of inexperienced , unaccountable manager			0
' the @entity149 first reported that @entity150 was black , but later corrected its story online			0
@entity152 , a former investigator for an outside firm the @entity0 hired to probe @entity150 's complaint , testified before a @entity156 subcommittee on april 2 that she found a work environment there rife with ' exclusion , retaliation , discrimination , nepotism , demoralization , devaluation and other offensive working conditions			2

@entity0 staff ratings showed racial disparities and other *unequal* results
whites *consistently* *outscored* blacks and unionized workers trailed their nonunion counterparts
the agency has scrapped the system instead of examining why the data came out *skewed* , awarding everyone the top rating on a scale of 1 to 5
' our performance ratings system did not meet our own objectives and expectations , ' read an internal report released this month to reporters
annual performance reviews *affect* salary raises , bonuses and career advancement
@entity130 has subpoenaed @entity0 officials over *accusations* of discrimination
