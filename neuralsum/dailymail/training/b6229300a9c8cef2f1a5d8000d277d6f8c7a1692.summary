by @entity1 reporter caretaker boss @entity2 refused to rule himself out of the running to succeed @entity4 as @entity6 head coach as they ended a run of three defeats with victory over luckless @entity11			1
although @entity2 is happy in his post as @entity14 manager , he sidestepped the question over his future role , and said : ' i love coaching and working with players			1

' @entity24 , the former @entity74 goalkeeper , repeatedly frustrated @entity11 and pulled off a crucial double save from former @entity6 favourite @entity53 and @entity55 in injury time , to leave @entity78 's men with only one point from their first five matches			1
@entity21 's 17th - minute goal , driven in from the left corner of the area , was enough to settle an entertaining game in @entity6 ' favour , but they owed much to @entity87 and young midfielders @entity30 and @entity29			1
@entity2 added : ' our keeper was out of this world			1
he made half a dozen saves out of the top drawer and showed bravery coming off his line			2
' in charge : caretaker boss @entity2 took charge of the side as @entity6 ran out 1 - 0 winners at @entity100 @entity30 , @entity29 and left - back @entity26 , who replaced the injured @entity21 , are graduates of @entity2 's @entity14 and he said : ' i was delighted with them			1
@entity30 was the best player on the pitch			0
he is old beyond his years and nothing fazes him			0
' a frustrated @entity78 admitted : ' i am scratching around to understand how our domination failed to get us anything from the game			0
we dominated possession in the last hour and created so many chances			0
' it was a mistake for the goal			2
we did n't get out quickly enough to close @entity21 down , and we have to stop making silly errors at the back			2
we came up against a keeper who played his part			0
@entity6 showed a lot of desire to keep the ball out of their net and we did n't show enough desire to put it in theirs			2
when we concede a goal , we have to work harder to score			2
' in form : striker @entity34 has impressed for @entity6 since arriving in the summer and set up @entity21 's goal leader : @entity6 captain @entity27 ( right ) attempts to halt @entity11 's @entity54 during the 1 - 0 win @entity6 ' controversial president and owner @entity129 heads for a break in @entity132 on monday , but that will not stop his search for a new head coach			1
former @entity137 boss @entity136 is among the front - runners for the job as @entity140 looks to appoint another @entity142 coach , who will inherit a strong squad according to @entity2			1
