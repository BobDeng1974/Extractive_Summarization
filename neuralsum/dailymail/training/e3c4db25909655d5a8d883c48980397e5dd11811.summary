by @entity0 , education correspondent published : 11:49 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 17:39 est , 19 november 2012 looking to the future : @entity2 says pupils will learn via @entity5 and video games in the future a new breed of ‘ @entity9 school ’ will allow pupils to play video games and learn from their comfort of their homes using web - based lessons and @entity5 , the leader of the country ’s private girls ’ schools predicted today			1
@entity20 ’s school system is failing to keep up with 21st century technology and must modernise to equip pupils with the skills they will need in future , according to @entity2			1
she said computer games such as ‘ immune attack ’ – where players attempt to stop the body being taken over by a virus – could be used to assess factual knowledge as well as decision - making and logical thinking			1
seeing a character killed off in a game was ‘ not a failure ’ , she insisted			2
pupils learned determination and perseverance as they tried new techniques to overcome the setback , she said			2
schools in future could also teach pupils topics such as @entity45 ’ theorem at home through internet connections and then reinforce them in class , in a reversal of the traditional approach of school - based lessons followed by homework			1
mrs @entity2 , president of the @entity54 ’ @entity53 , shared her vision of how schools could prepare children for life in the 2020s in a keynote speech			2
the self - confessed @entity9 fan and ‘ techie ’ said many technological advances foreshadowed by the cult sci - fi series had already materialised , such as mobile phones , speaking directly to a computer and light sensors			2
‘ the @entity9 society is upon us – but where is the @entity9 school ? ’ she said			2
‘ we already know we are in a situation where our school - based provision lags behind the technology of the 21st century			0
the way forward ? children could be learning from home via @entity5 in the future ‘ the question we must ask ourselves , as education leaders , is what are we going to do about it ? ‘ we must do more to prepare our pupils for the world as it is and as it will be			1
’ her call came days after education secretary @entity89 announced plans for a new hi - tech computer science curriculum with the same status as traditional subjects			1
pupils as young as seven could be required to learn to ‘ code ’ or write computer programs			2
inspiring a new generation : @entity2 is a fan of the popular tv show @entity9 but mrs @entity2 , head of @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102 , said many of mr @entity89 ’s other proposed reforms to public exams and the school curriculum were ‘ taking us back to a bygone era ’			1
she insisted she was not calling for ‘ immediate wholesale change ’ but more ‘ creative curriculum decisions ’			0
‘ if you watch a child playing a game , whether it is a technological game or not , they learn by doing , failing , trying new pathways and techniques , ’ she told the @entity112 ’s annual conference in @entity102			0
learning via games : mrs @entity2 says video games such as immune attack can be educational ‘ being killed off in a game is not a failure			1
most children will continue with determination , and persevere for a long time ; and before you think it 's about ‘ shoot and kill ’ , have you watched an 8 year old playing “ build a zoo ”			0
’ outlining how the ‘ classroom of the future ’ might look , she said : ‘ will we be able to use online / remote delivery of lessons with local support via @entity5 or use the gaming world ? ’ games involving decision - making and role - playing could help pupils develop problem - solving skills , she said			1
in ‘ immune attack ’ for example ‘ the teachers can see how well the facts are known by students as they can assess whether the game is approached with logic or by a random approach ’			0
but she added that , although schools in the future ‘ may have to avatars or virtual teachers ’ , teachers will still be needed ‘ in some form or other ’			0
‘ nothing else provides quite the same subtlety and effectiveness of communication our body language and immediate presence can provide			0
’ stuck in the past : @entity2 said @entity89 's policies were taking education back to a bygone era in a wide - ranging speech , mrs @entity2 also insisted that private schools should not be forced to share their facilities and expertise with their state school ‘ competition ’			1
fee - paying middle - class parents were already faced with ‘ increasing ’ charges due to the growing weight of regulation and red tape private schools are coming under			0
it was ‘ beyond the pale ’ to expect schools to share facilities and their ‘ dna ’ – such as their expertise in running @entity183 ( @entity183 ) – with state school parents who had decided against sending their children private schools			0
@entity190 and mr @entity89 have both urged private schools to sponsor state - funded academies and share resources and facilities			1
mrs @entity2 said private schools were prepared to help , but on their own terms			0
‘ many of us happily do this already with a wide variety of schools on our own terms , but when we are squeezed between the tightening rules and regulations being imposed upon us , the rising cost of our provision and the ability of middle - class parents to pay our increasing fees , it seems a bit beyond the pale to ask if we will share aspects of our unique selling point with local competition , ’ she said			0
‘ and competition it is ; why should my school offer its expertise and experience to parents who could have sent their children to my school , but chose not to , or to a government who criticises my morality ? ’			0

video games will help teach pupils factual knowledge
