by @entity0 organisers of the @entity2 say they were stunned to find competitors using bizarre tactics in a bid to win the race			1
the race , which takes place at the @entity9 in @entity10 in @entity11 sees chickens compete over a 20 yard course in a tradition dating back over 100 years			1
but with the race being completed in record times this year , organisers say people are taking to training their chickens , with contestants seen banging tins and garden forks , talking in strange tongues and even using a home - made tuning fork to egg the hens on			1
the @entity28 took place in @entity10 , near @entity30 in @entity11 in a tradition dating back over 100 years organisers of the race suspect that people have been training their chickens in a bid to make sure they win the race @entity37 , with her hen @entity39			1
around 52 hens were entered into the race in a tradition dating back more than 100 years the event saw more than 600 locals and tourists descend on the village of @entity10 for the event , with many bringing their own contestants around 52 hens lined up for this year 's event on saturday , which saw more than 600 locals and tourists descend upon the village			1
but rather than seeing a random chicken taking the title , it seemed as though the birds were being groomed for glory , with a new course record set , and even a photo finish at the end			2
now pub landlady and one of the organisers @entity63 reckoned this year 's form showed the ancient tradition had entered a new era			2
she said : ' it was great day which showed we have moved into the era of professional hen racing			0
people are quite clearly training the hens			0
the winning hen was @entity75 , front , owned by @entity77 and trained by his ten - year - old brother @entity78 @entity82 , with his trophy after his hen @entity75 won the @entity28 after winning the race , @entity78 , holding @entity75 celebrates with his father @entity84 who pops the champagne after missing out on being crowned champion , @entity87 gives his hen phall the opportunity to drown his sorrows ' we have a laugh about it			1
how do you get a hen to race ? we thought it was a bit of fun			0
' but this year there were five or six hens which have literally been trained to run to the other end			2
' we had one girl tapping a tin which produced a high - pitched sound			0
she had lined it with tin foil and had a fork which was like a tuning key to make it stand out from the shaking of the tins everyone else had			0
' it is a keen contest now with covert training methods			0
' we also have people shouting in weird voices , placing buckets of fishing worms on the finish line and banging tins			1
it all seemed to work pretty well			0
' this year 's winning chicken was three - year - old @entity75 , owned by 13 - year - old @entity77 , who keeps the bird as a pet at the bottom of his garden			1
one hen is so keen to start the race , he escapes from his owner 's hands at the start line one of the organisers of the race sais it was clear some of the entrants had been groomed for glory by being trained by their owners around 52 hens lined up for this year 's event on saturday , which saw more than 600 locals and tourists descend upon the village after a busy day racing his chickens , @entity144 loads his birds back into his car to prepare them for next year 's event but it was @entity77 's ten - year - old brother @entity78 , who took the bird in hand and turned him into a champion			1
@entity154 , 35 , also ensured the bird was on good form by placing a pot of meal worms on the finish line			0
but at no one was quite sure which of the finalists was first past the post so there was stewards ' inquiry			2
however , ms @entity63 added : ' it was a photo finish which had to be replayed on a phone to see which chicken 's foot crossed the line first			2
' but mr @entity77 never had any doubts explaining : ' luckily it was wet			0
our bird prefers wet going and soggy ground			0
