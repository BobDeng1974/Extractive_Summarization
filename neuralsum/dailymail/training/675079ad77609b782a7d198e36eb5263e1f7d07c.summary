a massive ancient subglacial trough deeper than the @entity1 has been discovered under @entity2			2
part of a massive ancient mountain range , it was found buried under several km of ice using specially developed penetrating radars			1
the massive subglacial valley is up to 3 kilometres deep , more than 300 kilometres long and up to 25 kilometres across , and in places , the valley floor is more than 2000 metres below sea level			1
all calm - the area above the giant mountain range , which is covered in upto 7km of ice the massive subglacial valley is up to 3 kilometres deep , more than 300 kilometres long and up to 25 kilometres across , and in places , the valley floor is more than 2000 metres below sea level			1
the mountain range and deep valley were carved millions of years ago by a small icefield similar to those of the present - day @entity22 , or those of @entity25 and @entity26			1
researcher were able to chart it for the first time by combining data from satellites and ice - penetrating radars towed behind skidoos and on - board small aircraft			2
in fact , it is so large researchers say it can be seen from space - despite being several kilometres underground			2
the research involved scientists from @entity43 , the @entity45 ’s @entity44 , the @entity46 and the universities of @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50			0
they charted the @entity51 – an ancient mountain range buried beneath several kilometres of @entity22 ice - by combining data from satellites and ice - penetrating radars towed behind skidoos and on - board small aircraft			1
the researchers spent three seasons investigating and mapping the region in @entity2			0
the mountain range and deep valley were carved millions of years ago by a small icefield similar to those of the present - day @entity22 , or those of @entity25 and @entity26			1
professor @entity70 , professor of geosciences at the @entity45 , said : ' while the idea of @entity73 growth and decay over the past few million years has been discussed for decades , the precise location where the ice sheet may originate from in growth phases , and decay back to in periods of decay , has not been known			1
of of the sub-ice radar images which helped researchers pinpoint the vast valley , showing the giant mountains ans passes between them ' by looking at the topography beneath the ice sheet using a combination of ice - penetrating radio - echo sounding and satellite imagery , we have revealed a region which possesses classic glacial geomorphic landforms , such as u-shaped valleys and cirques , that could only have been formed by a small ice cap , similar to those seen at present in the @entity92 and @entity93 @entity91			1
' the region uncovered is , therefore , the site of ice sheet genesis in @entity2			0
' the team ’s analysis has provided an unprecedented insight into the extent , thickness and behaviour of this ancient icefield , and the configuration and behaviour of the early @entity73			2
the subglacial landscape shows where and how the @entity73 originated and grew			1
it also provides important clues about the size and shape of the ice sheet in @entity2 in a warmer global climate			0
the findings are published in the latest edition of the @entity116			0
another image showing the vast valley , outlined in black here the paper ’s lead author dr @entity120 , from @entity43 , said : ' the discovery of this huge trough , and the characterisation of the surrounding mountainous landscape , was incredibly serendipitous			0
' we had acquired ice penetrating radar data from both ends of this huge hidden valley , but we had no information to tell us what was in between			0
' satellite data was used to fill the gap , because despite being covered beneath several kilometres of ice , the valley is so vast that it can be seen from space			1
' to me , this just goes to demonstrate how little we still know about the surface of our own planet			0
the discovery and exploration of hidden , previously - unknown landscapes is still possible and incredibly exciting , even now			0
' the research was funded by the @entity145 ( @entity145 )			0
the u-shaped hanging tributary valleys of the @entity147 seen on radar			0
the radargram depicts two obvious tributary valleys , the largest of which is 1 km deep by 3 km wide .			2

ancient mountain range found buried beneath kilometres of @entity22 ice
it is 3 kilometres deep , more than 300 kilometres long and up to 25 kilometres across
@entity157 is so vast that scientists say it can be seen from space
@entity161 sheds light on how the @entity73 originated and grew
