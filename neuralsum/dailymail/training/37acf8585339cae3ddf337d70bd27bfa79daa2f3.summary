@entity60 : $ 26million figures from @entity62 published march 2012 in exchange for the astronomical price the mystery buyer will get a 10,923 - square - foot space opposite @entity26 with incredible views over the city			1
while @entity70 has not revealed exactly how much the plush living space has fetched they have said the figure is between $ 90 - $ 100million			0

situated on 157 west 57th street the tower will become the tallest residential building in the city when it is finished next year			1
the @entity81 has reported that some potential buyers have claimed there are ' design flaws ' with the construction - namely that builders failed to provide a sufficient number of elevators			0
