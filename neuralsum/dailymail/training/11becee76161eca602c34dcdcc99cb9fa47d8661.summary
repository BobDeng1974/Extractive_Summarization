the radical @entity1 spacecraft , designed to carry astronauts into deep space , has arrived at @entity4 in @entity5			1
engineers are now preparing @entity1 to launch atop 180ft tall ( 55 metres ) @entity8 rockets in an unmanned test flight on december 4th			1
the spacecraft is hoped to take astronauts to explore an asteroid and eventually make the 34 million mile ( 55 million km ) journey to @entity14			1
' in a few years we will be sending our astronauts to destinations humans have never experienced			0
it 's thrilling to be a part of the journey now , at the beginning			0
' during the trip to @entity4 from @entity40 's @entity39 , the conical - shaped capsule was encased in its 52ft - tall ( 16 metre ) protective fairing			1
the entire transported stack - which includes the fairing , crew module and ‘ @entity45 ’ - is 70ft tall ( 21 metres ) in total , or about the size of five double decker buses			0
when attached to the rockets , it will be around 250ft ( 76 metres )			0
last month the @entity52 rocket , built by @entity8 , made its move to nearby @entity54 at @entity4			1
deep space : the spacecraft is hoped to take astronauts to explore an asteroid and eventually make the 34 million mile ( 55 million km ) to @entity14 safety checks : during the four - hour mission , engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety such as the launch abort system the launch @entity45 and upper stage , shown in the left of this image , have been transported to @entity4			1
here , they will be joined with the @entity70 ahead of a test flight in december			2
the right image shows the stages @entity1 will go through during flight during its december 4 test flight , the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles ( 5,790km ) into space			1
it will then take two big laps around @entity26 before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph ( 32,200 km / h ) and parachuting into the @entity81 off the @entity83 coast			0
during the two - orbit , four - hour mission , engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety , the launch abort system , the heat shield and the parachute system			2
the data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models			0
the flight also will reduce overall mission risks and costs for later @entity1 flights			2
the capsule will re-enter @entity26 's atmosphere generating temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees @entity101 , before splashing down in the @entity81			0
the rocket 's three @entity102 were tested , processed and attached to each other to form the first stage that will connect to @entity1 's service module			1
it then was raised last week from the horizontal position into its vertical launch configuration			0
for @entity1 's dry run , the @entity110 - built capsule will have hunks of aluminium in place of seats for ballast , and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays			1
the @entity1 capsule is topped by a @entity120 that would life astronauts to safety during an emergency during a manned mission			1
during its december launch , @entity1 will complete two orbits of @entity26 at an altitude of 3,600 miles ( 5,790 km ) over 4.5 hours , during which ground control will test the spacecraft 's systems			1
test flight : @entity1 will make two big laps around @entity26 before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph ( 32,200 km / h )			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of the @entity1 craft in orbit ready for launch : @entity39 director @entity140 , far left , answers a question during a news conference prior to the rollout of the @entity1 as participants , second from left , @entity146 , @entity148 director , @entity149 , @entity1 manager and @entity151 , director of human space flight programs at @entity110 listen the mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next - generation @entity1			1
after the @entity1 and the asteroid are attached , the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object			2
once the @entity1 docks with the remote - operated asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows			2
after the mission is complete , @entity1 returns to @entity26 on the same path it journeyed out on , loops around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean - likely the @entity178 days later			2
the mission is seen as an important step towards sending humans to @entity14			0
during its december 4 test flight , the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles ( 5,790km ) into space			1
it will then take two big laps around @entity26 before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph ( 32,200 km / h ) and parachuting into the @entity81 off the @entity83 coast			0
during the two - orbit , four - hour mission , engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety , the launch abort system , the heat shield and the parachute system			2
the data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models			0
the spacecraft will also pass through the @entity202 radiation belts - two concentric rings encircling the @entity26 and held in place by a magnetic field			0
since the @entity202 belts were first discovered in 1958 , astronomers have been trying to trace the source of the super-acceleration			0
the acceleration is so high that satellites have to protect their sensitive components with shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the belts the @entity1 capsule has been outfitted with sensors to take new readings on the belt and ensure that it does n't interfere with any of the capsule 's onboard electronics			2
@entity1 will re-enter @entity26 's atmosphere at almost 20,000mph ( 32,180 km / h ) , and reach temperatures near 2,200 ° @entity224 )			0
at this stage , its parachute system will deploy to slow the spacecraft for a splashdown in the @entity81			0
@entity1 has its roots in the @entity231 shuttle era ; it originated a decade ago as a crew exploration vehicle to get astronauts beyond low @entity26 orbit and managed to survive the cancellation of the @entity237 project			0
on future missions , @entity1 will carry astronauts farther into the solar system than ever before , including to an asteroid , and @entity14			1
four hour mission : @entity1 ( artist 's impression pictured ) will reach temperatures near 2,200 ° @entity224 ) during its test flight in december big move : the @entity1 capsule is shown here being moved from the @entity248 at @entity39 , last night rocket power : at the @entity8 ( @entity250 ) @entity251 ( @entity252 ) , at @entity4 , @entity5 , the three primary core elements of the @entity255 rocket recently were integrated , forming the first stage of the vehicle that will launch @entity1			1

@entity40 's @entity1 spacecraft is designed to carry astronauts to an asteroid and eventually to @entity14
it today travelled from the @entity39 to @entity4 in @entity5
engineers are now preparing @entity1 to launch atop a @entity8 rocket
pointed tip of the capsule is known as the @entity120 and can take astronaut 's to safety
the fairing - or casing - which aims to stream line the launch , will be *jettisoned* during @entity1 's ride into space
unmanned test flight will take place on december 4th and will take around four hours , @entity40 said
