middle - class mothers are quitting high powered jobs because they are not prepared to behave like men by getting into work early and staying out late socialising , a new study claims			1

trying to have it all : women are more likely to ditch a highly paid job that clashes with childcare responsibilities , rather than compete with men in their office , researchers said despite some gains in equality , workplace culture is still male dominated , said workplace psychologists from the @entity27 's @entity26			1
this means that workplaces could be losing well qualified and capable female executives rather than adapt the culture to suit working mothers			2
middle - class mothers are quitting high powered jobs because they are not prepared to behave like men by getting into work early and staying out late socialising ( illustrated ) , the study claims ‘ middle - class working mothers are leaving work because they are unwilling to behave like men , ’ said report authors @entity37 and @entity39			1
‘ mothers in professional and managerial jobs are expected to stay late or get in early even if they have negotiated reduced working hours			1
‘ and ( they are expected ) to socialise with colleagues or clients in the evenings - even though this clashes with their childcare responsibilities			0
‘ they must do so because working culture is still organised by men , who are less involved in childcare			2
many mothers respond by leaving their jobs			0
‘ unless mothers mimic successful men , they do not look the part for success in organisations			0
’ their study , which is based on interviews with professional women in different sectors , found that it is not just men who are guilty of creating a hostile environment for working mothers			0
female employees without children are quite happy to promote and join in with the macho culture , they found			1
one mother , who used to work as a banker , said when she left as 6pm to look after her children she would get ' barbed comments ' from a female co-worker who did not have children			0
the study found that it is not just men who are guilty of creating a hostile environment for working mothers			0
female employees without children are happy to promote and join in with the macho culture ( illustrated ) the researchers said			1
some women hide the fact they are mothers to avoid falling foul of hostile attitudes , according to the report that was published in the journal @entity90			0
the researchers interviewed 26 women who had left work after having children or getting pregnant in reach their conclusions			0
many of the women said they were ' side - lined ' on their return to the office after giving birth			0
' many women leave high - powered jobs because they are relegated to lesser roles and feel the need to suppress their identities as mothers , ' the study said			2
‘ this is not only unfair			0
as an economy , we can not afford to waste such skilled and educated workers			0
’ boys whose fathers work very long hours are more likely to become tearaways , according to research published last summer			1
a study of more than 1,400 children found those whose fathers worked more than 55 hours a week were more delinquent and aggressive than their peers , yet the same phenomenon was not identified in daughters			2
further research now needs to be carried out to discover why this happens in males , and to look for ways to tackle it			0
the study was run by the @entity126 in @entity127 , but was based in @entity128 where one in five fathers work at least 55 hours week when their children were between five and eight			2
mothers ' working hours did not seem to matter , although few @entity136 mothers worked long hours , according to the study			1
dr @entity139 , of the @entity126 , @entity127 , said : ' it is possible when fathers work very long hours , children are less well monitored after school , especially if mothers also work full time hours			1
' there is some evidence pre-adolescent boys are less well monitored than girls when fathers have high work related demands , including long hours , and as a consequence have more conduct problems			1
' the culture of working long hours , which has crept into many jobs should be the next policy frontier , said the researchers .			1
