when this trio of giant pandas were born , vets said the chances of them all surviving were next to nothing - but the baby girl and her two brothers have defied predictions to reach 100 days old in perfect health			1
there have been four recorded instances of giant pandas giving birth to triplets in history , but in all of those cases at least one of the litter has died due to physical defects or being too small			2
each of this lucky bunch now weighs more than 11lbs , up from just three and a half ounces at birth , and have two small teeth each after beginning teething at around 80 days old			2
the cubs were born on july 29 within four hours , the female cub first and then her brothers			0
physical exams show the cubs ' health to be ideal , said @entity27 , general manager of @entity28 in @entity29 , capital of south @entity33 's @entity32 province			1
starting wednesday , the cubs will be displayed to visitors for limited times and are taking turns living with their mother for five - day cycles , and may all live with her permanently if they continue to grow up healthy			0
the cubs have n't been named , but the park is seeking suggestions from the public			0

trio were born on june 29 at @entity28 in @entity33 but were given almost no chance of survival

but these triples have become the first to survive to 100 days old and are now preparing to be put on display
