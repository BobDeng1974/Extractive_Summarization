@entity6 realised he had cancer after he saw the signs in a graphic warning image he was designing for use on cigarette packets			1
the 50 - year - old graphic designer from @entity13 has been creating cigarette packets for more than 30 years but in june he noticed he had similar symptoms to those on a packet he was designing			1
@entity6 , 50 , was diagnosed with tongue cancer after recognising the signs from the warning on a cigarette packet he was designing			1
he has had surgery to remove the tumour and rebuild his tongue ( pictured ) as a result , he went to his doctor and was quickly diagnosed with cancer of the tongue			1
he had an operation last month to remove the tumour and replace the missing tissue with skin and a vein from his forearm			1
mr @entity6 , who smoked 10 cigarettes a day for 20 years before giving up in 2005 , said : ‘ i am very lucky			1
if i had a different job i may not have ever recognised the symptoms			2
my job saved my life			0
‘ it would have probably been another four or five weeks before i would have started to think about going to a doctor or anything like that			2
i may not have done			0
‘ i am so lucky i do what i do for a living			0
that is the simple point			0
that picture is the thing that really set me into action and made me go and find out what was wrong with me			0
‘ i first realised something might be wrong in june			2
i had the operation in september			0
mr @entity6 recognised the signs of tongue cancer from a cigarette packet ( pictured ) that he was designing for an @entity57 company			1
he says that he believes his job saved his life ‘ i have had cancer of the tongue and they removed it all away and basically in the job that i do i saw this picture it and aroused some sort of suspicion in my mind as to what was going on			1
‘ they removed a cancerous tumour from the tongue and replaced it with skin and a vein from my forearm			1
‘ they also removed cells from my neck as well as some teeth			0
i will be in recovery for another three weeks and am looking forward to going back to doing the job i did before			0
’ father - of - two mr @entity6 was designing the image for display on a packet of @entity57 cigarettes			1
it showed a woman suffering severe throat and mouth cancer			2
mr @entity6 is now urging the @entity89 government to force @entity89 cigarette companies to put warnings over the whole of their packets so that no branding is visible now in recovery and preparing for radiotherapy , mr @entity6 is urging the @entity89 government to force @entity89 firms to carry warning images over the whole of their packets so no branding is visible			1
last year @entity57 became the first country in the world to adopt the policy - which sees packets entirely covered in graphic warnings			1
despite a recent survey by the @entity108 which revealed that a third of @entity89 teenagers are put off smoking due to the health warning pictures , the government is not convinced			2
a @entity114 spokesman said : ‘ we take very seriously the potential for standardised packaging to reduce smoking rates			0
‘ but in light of the differing views , we have decided to wait until the emerging impact of the decision in @entity57 can be measured and then we will make a decision			0
’ mr @entity6 said : ‘ i mainly design them for @entity57 companies and i have n’t seen that many in this country			1
‘ i would urge this to change and i encourage people to really look at the pictures on the side of the packets			0
‘ if i had seen a @entity89 one i would n’t have known anything about my symptoms as the picture would n’t be there			0
’ a spokesperson for mr @entity6 ’s company @entity138 , said : ‘ @entity6 is an important and popular member of our team , we look forward to having him back			2
‘ we were all concerned to hear that he had discovered a potential medical issue whilst viewing a tobacco health warning image during the course of his job			1
‘ all of us in the studio have been exposed to these types of health warning images for many years , but this is the first time that we have felt their full impact so close to home			0
‘ looking back over the past few weeks it is quite a remarkable story to think that @entity6 discovered the cancer in the way that he did			1

symptoms include a red or white patch on the tongue that does not clear up , a persistent sore throat , an ulcer that does not heal , pain when swallowing , numbness in the mouth or bleeding from the tongue			2
