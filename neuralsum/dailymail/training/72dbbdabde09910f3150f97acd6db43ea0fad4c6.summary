apprentice panel beater @entity3 fished in his pockets for a bag of @entity20 sweets to give to the youngsters but instead pulled out a plastic pack containing eight snap bags of cocaine he had bought for £ 200 earlier that day , @entity4 heard			1
he dropped the drugs into the goody bags carried by the three children , aged eight , six and five , who were out playing trick or treat , escorted by their father , an off - duty policeman			1
the 23 - year - old defendant then closed the door , went back inside the house and put his hand in his pockets to get out his drugs - but instead pulled out the @entity20 sweets			1
@entity3 immediately realised what had happened and went on foot , then by car , scouring the streets of @entity4 to find the youngsters			1
but the officer , pc @entity42 , had taken his children home and , as they emptied their goody bags to share the spoils , he spotted the drugs - and made a swift call to his on - duty colleagues			1
@entity3 , who had never been in trouble with police before , has a job and attends college , wiped his eyes with his hands as he stood in the dock and admitted a single charge of possessing a @entity60 drug on october 31			2
@entity3 , of @entity61 , @entity4 , was given a 12 month community order , ordered to do 130 hours community work and told he must pay court costs totalling £ 145 by chair of the bench @entity67			1
earlier @entity68 , prosecuting , told the court @entity3 was at his girlfriend 's house in @entity72 , @entity73 , on @entity74 night when the incident happened			2
the defendant had earlier that day bought £ 200 worth of cocaine , divided it up into snap bags and put it in his trouser pocket			2
his girlfriend had also bought some small bags of @entity20 sweets which they had been handing out to trick - or - treating youngsters that evening			1
mix up : @entity3 meant to give the children some @entity20 sweets but gave them cocaine instead when @entity91 's children approached , @entity3 put his hand in his trouser pocket , pulled out what he thought were @entity20 sweets and dropped them in the goody bags they were holding			1
mr @entity68 told the court : ' mr @entity42 and the children thanked the defendant			2
that was their last call of the evening and they decided to go home - the children were soaked to their skin			2
' back home the children went up to their bedroom to share out the sweets when their father popped in and spotted the ' treat ' from @entity3			1
' he asked his daughter where this item came from			0
she said it was from the last call , " mr @entity68 told the court			0
meanwhile , @entity3 had realised his mistake			2
more than they bargained for : @entity91 's children went trick or treating in @entity4 where @entity3 gave them bags of cocaine instead of sweets by mistake mr @entity68 added : ' once he 's gone back inside and put his hand in his pocket again and instead has pulled out a pack of @entity20 and immediately realised what he had done			1
' he then drove around the area trying to locate the children			0
' when @entity3 answered the door to police who arrived to arrest him			2
he told them : ' i know exactly why you are here			0
i knew you were coming			0
' mr @entity68 said there was a ' wry ' side to the case but the consequences could have been very serious			0
' had dad not have gone in and recognised what it was , this could have been a very serious case			0
" @entity144 , defending , said @entity3 had initially acted out of ' public spirit ' by giving out sweets - but that had gone badly wrong			1
' this was an accidental act			0
it was grossly foolhardy , ' he said			0
' it took him only a matter of minutes to realise his error			0
' this is clearly a highly unusual and unfortunate case			0
not surprisingly it has attracted a good deal of adverse publicity			0
' he has been embarrassed by the publicity but does not seek to feel sorry for himself			0
