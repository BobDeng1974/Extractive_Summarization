by @entity1 reporter published : 00:38 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 10:36 est , 31 october 2013 the @entity2 is the latest in a growing list of publications to stop using the term ' @entity6 ' when it refers to @entity9 's @entity8 team			1
managing editor @entity10 announced on wednesday that the newspaper 's style council decided to eliminate the term because of a long - standing policy against using racial slurs			1
' " redskin " is a patently racist term , ' ms @entity16 said			2
in recent months , local leaders in @entity9 and some members of @entity29 have also called for a name change , and some media outlets have stopped using the name			2
it is also the subject of a long - running legal challenge from a group of @entity37 seeking to void the team 's federal trademark protection			1
@entity6 ' owner @entity40 has said that the original @entity6 had a @entity42 coach in the 1930s before the franchise relocated to @entity9			2
but @entity45 , a major figure in the trademark case before the @entity48 , was unimpressed with the reference which she described as part of the team 's ' time - dishonored history of putting up pseudo-indians as part of their promotion			1
' campaign : the @entity2 is the latest publication to say it will no longer use the term @entity6 outdated ? @entity59 , unofficial mascot of the @entity6 , signs autographs during fan appreciation day at the @entity6 ' @entity8 football training camp at @entity6 in @entity64 , @entity65 in 2012 ms @entity45 also rebuffed an assertion by mr @entity40 that the team has an obligation to its fans to preserve its heritage			1
' part of that heritage and tradition is name - calling , belittling and maligning native peoples , ' @entity45 said in an email to @entity77			0
' the n - word was traditional and had quite a heritage , too			0
happily , not all traditions are carried on forever			0
' the debate about whether the term is an epithet has raged for decades			0
the @entity2 says it revisited the issue last month at the request of @entity86 , one of its sports columnists			0
the paper also recently ran an editorial by @entity91 , in which she recalled an encounter two @entity37 friends of hers had when they watched the @entity6 play about 40 years ago			0
tussle : fans and campaigners are fighting over claims that the team 's name is offensive the couple ' took their seats , only to be treated like living mascots by @entity6 fans			1
she spoke of being " poked " and having their hair " pawed " by them , " in a scary way " , ' she wrote in the @entity2			0
ms @entity91 added : ' when it 's all over , we 'll look back with amazement at the fact that a team had a name like that in the nation 's capital			2
we 'll look back and realize how shameful and embarrassing it really was			0
' when the @entity2 refers to the team , it will now call them the ' @entity21 ' ms @entity10 said .			1
