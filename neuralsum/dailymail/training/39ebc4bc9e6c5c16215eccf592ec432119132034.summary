tens of thousands of people a year are dying unnecessarily of cancer simply because they are elderly or poor , a report has revealed			2
the @entity4 , which analysed the latest @entity6 figures , accused the health service of age discrimination when it came to cancer patients ’ care			1
it said if the cancer mortality rates of the poorest people were brought up to the level of the most well - off , there would be almost 20,000 fewer deaths every single year			0
the @entity4 found cancer mortality rates of the poorest people were brought up to the level of the most well - off , there would be almost 20,000 fewer deaths every single year ( file picture ) ‘ significant variations and inequalities in outcomes and access to services persist , ’ the report stated			1
‘ outcomes and access to services are generally poorer for older patients			0
and those from more deprived socio - economic groups are more likely to experience worse outcomes compared with those from less deprived groups			0
’ for all cancer patients , five - year survival rates are still 10 per cent behind the average for the six most wealthy @entity35 nations			1
in @entity37 , 64 per cent of cancer patients are still alive after five years but in @entity39 it is just 49 per cent			1
for patients aged 75 and above , the gap is even worse			0
pressure on @entity6 resources could mean that progress on survival rates ‘ stalls ’ in the coming years			1
‘ poorer access to treatment or poorer quality of care ’ is mostly to blame for the gaps , according to the report			0
@entity37 @entity53 @entity54 @entity55 @entity56 @entity57 @entity39 64.2 % 59.8 % 59.3 % 56.2 % 56.1 % 54.6 % 49.1 % it continues : ‘ people in @entity39 are less likely to develop cancer than in other high - income countries in @entity35 but , according to the most recent data , cancer outcomes in @entity39 have generally been worse			2
‘ outcomes are particularly poor in relative terms for older patients			0
’ those aged 55 to 64 are about 20 per cent more likely to survive a year after being diagnosed with cancer than those aged 75 or more			0
this is much too large a gap to be explained by frailty alone , according to the @entity4 , indicating that age discrimination may be at least partly to blame			1
meanwhile , waiting times for urgent cancer treatment are increasing , with the number of @entity6 trusts failing to meet targets doubling in a year to 64			2
from last july to september alone , some 5,500 patients waited more than 62 days for treatment			1
the damning report comes at a difficult time for the @entity82 , which is already having to explain why there is an @entity85 crisis , with waiting times at record levels			0
the @entity4 accused the health service of age discrimination when it came to cancer patients ’ care ( file picture ) last night @entity93 mp @entity92 , chairman of the @entity94 , said she was ‘ deeply disappointed ’ by the ‘ shocking disparity ’ in cancer survival rates compared with @entity35			1
‘ there are also unacceptable inequalities within @entity39 that must be tackled , ’ she added			0
@entity99 , national clinical director for cancer at @entity39 , said he accepted that survival rates needed to improve			2
‘ cancer survival rates in @entity39 are at an all - time high ... it ’s time for a fresh look at how we can do even better – with more focus on prevention , earlier diagnosis and modern radiotherapy and other services so that over the next five years we can save at least 8,000 more lives a year			1
’ he added : ‘ we have established an independent cancer taskforce to produce a new five - year cancer strategy by the summer , which will set out what needs to be done to achieve this ambition			0
