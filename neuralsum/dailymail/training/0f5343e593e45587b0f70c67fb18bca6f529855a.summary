two male black bears stand on hind legs with their paws in the air as they prepare to fight ... and one brave photographer had a ring - side seat at the boxing match			1
the 300lb animals were spotted in a wooded area of @entity9 , @entity10 , as they tried to prove who 's boss			1
award - winning wildlife photographer @entity13 , 39 , stood just yards away and captured the bears on camera as they moved about battled each other			1
along with her photography partner @entity31 , @entity30 has been studying the bears for years and was able to get remarkably close to the animals			1
as well as taking pictures of the thrilling battle between two males , @entity30 and @entity31 also got right up close to their subjects quite by accident as the bears moved around them			1
@entity30 said : ' the spring bear hunt was cancelled in 1999 after concerns that bear cubs were being orphaned and dying of starvation because their mothers were being killed			2
' in 2014 the @entity9 reinstated the spring bear hunt in a few test areas			1
as a photographer you get very attached to the animals you photograph on a regular basis and sharing their location could put them in danger for various reasons			1
' i was at times mere feet from one of the bears			2
this was not intentional on my part			0
while photographing bears which were farther away , one particular bear surprised me a few times by cutting out of the woods to my right and walking right in front of me			1
the male black bears can be seen standing on two legs with their paws in the air as they prepare to fight			1
@entity30 , 39 , stood just yards away and captured the bears on camera as they moved about the wooded and grassy area along with her photography partner @entity31 , @entity30 has been studying the bears for years and was able to get remarkably close to the animals black bears are found in most parts of @entity82 and , despite being less dangerous to humans than their bigger grizzly cousins , adults can still weigh up to 300lb			1
bears communicate their dominance by intimidating their opponent , but they do not fight with one another unless it 's absolutely necessary			1
fights risk injury , which is not the bear 's objective			2
it 's all about posturing			0
' this was quite a surprise			0
i decided the best thing to do in that situation was to keep calm , talk to the bear in a low voice and wait until he moved on			2
' if i was already down on my knees then i stayed there and when i was standing i moved back slowly without turning away from the young male bear			2
' i never photograph the bears alone and my photography partner @entity31 took the photos of me with the bear standing only feet away ' the bears are in cottage country and are used to living in a populated area			1
he showed no aggression or warning signs that he was stressed			0
' i was prepared and had bear spray on me but since they can move so quickly , the difference between a bear feet from you and a hundred feet away is only a split second			2
' it 's important not to run , to keep calm , read the bears ' behaviour and interpret warning signs			0
' do n't turn your back and if at all possible hike in groups of three or more people and stay together			0
' @entity85 can be dangerous but the possibility of a bear harming a person is grossly overstated in my opinion			0
bear encounters and attacks have been sensationalised and have created an unrealistic fear of bears			2
as well as taking pictures of the battle between two males , @entity30 and @entity31 also got right up close to their subjects quite by accident as the bears moved around them ' i was prepared and had bear spray on me but since they can move so quickly , the difference between a bear feet from you and a hundred feet away is only a split second , ' @entity30 said ' like any large predator , bears have the power to inflict horrible damage but they show tremendous restraint when dealing with people			1
despite what most people are told , bears that allow themselves to be seen by people do n't tend to be a threat to human safety			0
' there have only been seven black bear attacks resulting in deaths by four bears in over 100 years in @entity9			1
it was a special moment for me but i 'm not ashamed to admit that my heart started beating faster			0
' we have been conditioned to think that all bears are out to kill us but i have witnessed their patience with people , acceptance and their curiosity			0
' i think he was curious about me and my camera gear			0
i spent a considerable amount of time photographing them at that location and he was accustomed to seeing me around			0
' my fear is that he will approach someone else and he could be deemed a nuisance and killed but i 've been told that he and the other bears keep a safe distance from other people			0
' @entity30 revealed that the bear was curious about her and her camera gear			0
she had spent a lot of time photographing the bears in the area so they were accustomed to seeing her around ' like any large predator , bears have the power to inflict horrible damage but they show tremendous restraint when dealing with people			2
despite what most people are told , bears that allow themselves to be seen by people do n't tend to be a threat to human safety , ' @entity30 said			0
