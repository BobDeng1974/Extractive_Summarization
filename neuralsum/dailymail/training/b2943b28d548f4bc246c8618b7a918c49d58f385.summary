how are you feeling today ? chances are , not that great ... because this morning you woke up on what has come to be known as ‘ @entity3 ’ - the day of the year on which most of us feel at our lowest ebb			1
there is indeed not much going for the third monday of the year			0
feeling blue : the third monday of the year is the day on which most of us feel at our lowest ebb if you struggled with travel chaos this chilly morning , that will only have added to the woes that come from feeling poorer after an expensive @entity13 and minimal hours of daylight			1
added to failed @entity16 ’s resolutions , a general drop in motivation , and the summer far away in the future , you could be forgiven for not wanting to get out of bed at all			1
on the plus side , we are likely to be in better form tomorrow			0
but for the 24 hours of @entity3 we will just have to grit our teeth and have an early night			0
miserable : people have got a lot to feel depressed about at this time of year a report suggests that a major reason for a drop in motivation comes from the continued winter darkness after the brief highlights of @entity13 and @entity33 year			1
a survey by @entity35 into the impact of reduced daylight over the winter months found that the vast majority of us feel it has a negative impact on our wellbeing			1
their report claims 79 per cent of us feel that limited hours of daylight has a negative effect on our mood			2
a spokesman for the company which quizzed 2,000 respondents said : ‘ the survey shows a clear link between natural daylight , mood and motivation			1
‘ it ’s encouraging to learn that little changes , like making sure you sit near a window or somewhere with as much natural light as possible , can make a big difference to how we feel and cope with winter			2
’ it has been suggested that the concept of ‘ @entity3 ’ was based on junk science drummed up by a travel company as a clever ploy to have us booking holidays to sunnier climes			2
it is thought the date was picked out by psychologist @entity3 after he came up with a scientific formula based on the length of time until next @entity13 , holiday debt and the likelihood of giving up @entity16 ’s resolutions			1
mr @entity3 first wrote about ‘ @entity3 ’ seven years ago - in a press release for @entity77 , a now defunct @entity78 tv travel channel			0
he based the theory on the ‘ hibernation ’ effect - a time of year when people feel tired , do n’t exercise , stay indoors and eat comfort food			0
he has said previously : ‘ it is the combination of factors that make life right now particularly uncertain			0
‘ there is threat of job redundancy and the cost of food and fuel are going up			0
’ since the idea of @entity3 has become well known mr @entity3 , from @entity93 , @entity94 , has admitted the idea of a single most depressing day was ‘ not particularly helpful ’ because it became ‘ a self - fulfilling prophecy ’ and that achieving happiness and being less materialistic was a year - round aim .			0

woes include travel chaos , feeling poor after @entity13 and lack of daylight
major drop in motivation comes from continued winter darkness
