by @entity0 published : 07:44 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 19:29 est , 29 october 2013 it is n't every day that @entity2 drives past your front door and the grins on the faces of this excited family were only rivalled by that of the monarch as she cruised through @entity10 in her @entity11			1
smiling and waving as she rolled through @entity12 , the @entity2 was spotted by the woman and two children as she rolled past the steps of their home on her way to an inner city riding centre			1
joined by daughter - in - law the @entity20 , the monarch , still a keen rider herself at 87 , was visiting the @entity24 and @entity25 in gang - ridden @entity10			1
her daughter - in - law , @entity34 , is president of the organisation which gives disadvantaged children from the @entity12 suburb , blighted by crime and rioting , a pastime away from the streets			1
chatting to volunteers the monarch joked : ' it ’s difficult to get them to do anything – children and horses			1
' she added : ' it ’s all about temperament '			0
on this it was not entirely clear which she was referring to , although one suspects she meant both			0
cheers : the @entity2 and the @entity20 arrived together and were greeted by a welcoming crowd all smiles : @entity2 , who looked cheerful in coral pink , smiled broadly as she was shown around the stables the two senior royals had made their way from @entity71 through several gritty housing estates in a chauffeur driven a @entity74 before they arrived at the centre , which is situated in the heart of bustling @entity10			1
dressed in a geranium wool crepe coat trimmed with gilt buttons over a contrasting salmon - coloured dress , the @entity2 was clearly impressed by what she saw			1
after being introduced to its founder , @entity82 , their host for the morning , she went straight to meet some of the children the club has helped and their favourite mounts			1
first was @entity88 , 18 , whose love of horses inspired by @entity24 has now developed into a full - time career			1
she is currently studying at the @entity92			0
she was holding the reins of one of the children ’s favourite ponies , an 11 - year - old black and white @entity97 called @entity98 , who had been picked for his gentle temperament			2
' i really do n’t think he will do anything to embarrass us , ' she said			0
the @entity2 asked her where she lived and how long she had been riding and sounded particularly impressed at @entity88 ’s choice of career			1
double act : the @entity2 and the @entity20 arrived to the sound of applause from onlookers ' he ’s wonderful , very smart ' said the queen gesturing to @entity98			1
' my heart was in my mouth , ' @entity88 said afterwards			0
@entity34 , wearing tartan @entity116 , was meanwhile making friends with the help of a large bag of mints she had taken from her pocket			1
' i think he ’s my now favourite , he ’s terrific , ' she said of @entity98 , who began to nudge her for more sweets			0
the @entity2 also talked intently to 13 - year - old @entity127 and was fascinated to learn that he lived in @entity128 , one of the run - down tower blocks overlooking the centre			1
demonstration : the royal guests were treated to a display of horsemanship before enjoying a tour of the school day out : the @entity2 beams as she watches the young riders at the @entity24 show their stuff ' what you mean he lives up there ? ' she said gesticulating to the building			1
@entity127 told the @entity2 that he had been riding for two years and that it had changed his life			1
he said afterwards : ' i saw them building the centre and came down every day to stand at the gates and bug them			0
i had never seen a horse before but offered to do the sweeping up , all their odd jobs , anything to be involved			0
' now i am here every spare minute i can			0
it ’s really changed my life			0
there ’s not a lot to do round here , all my friends hang around on the streets			2
people get into a lot of trouble			0
i am just here , though			0
' he added : ' i ’m really surprised she [ the @entity2 ] is coming to @entity10			2
it is full of trouble			0
' impressed : the @entity2 and the @entity20 appeared to enjoy the performance looks like fun : the @entity2 and the @entity20 enjoy a virtuoso display from the @entity24 @entity34 , meanwhile , was plying some of the other ponies with mints , prompting the stable ’s oldest resident , @entity179 , a 15 - year - old @entity177 , to bare her teeth in delight			1
' @entity34 remarked she must be an old lady but i told her there was still a lot of life in her , ' said @entity186 , 11			2
among the other riders the @entity2 chatted with was @entity188 , eight			2
he said afterwards : ' she asked me whether my picture was up on the wall [ with the other success stories ] and i told her that i had only had four lessons			0
she said : " i think it will be one day "			0
' the royal visitors were then introduced to the families of two local boys , both of whom were involved in the club but lost their lives in random acts of appalling violence – @entity204 , who was shot in 2006 , and @entity205 , who was just 15 when he was stabbed last september			2
the @entity2 told @entity204 ’s sister , @entity206 : ' it is a very unusual place [ referring to the location of the club ] but what a good idea			1
' visit : the @entity2 and the @entity20 walk side by side through the menage at @entity24 ' i ca n’t believe she is here , let along spoke to me			1
it has been totally surreal , ' she said			0
' the wonderful thing about riding is that is does n’t matter who you are or what you have done			0
' the horse does n’t know anything about you and does n’t care			0
you are n’t being judged			0
and if you do n’t concentrate on that horse then it will throw you or run off			0
' after touring the stables the @entity2 and @entity34 took their seats on a dais to watch a some of the club 's riders go through their paces , including taking a few jumps and even demonstrating a little basic polo			1
afterwards the @entity2 chatted to the youngsters and volunteers including @entity239 , 34 , who works in @entity240 miss @entity239 said : ' @entity2 said : " they are n’t your typical polo ponies , are they , but they have a lot of spirit			2
" ' surrounded : @entity34 gets to know a group of the @entity24 's equine residents and their riders @entity24 started 17 years ago when a lone volunteer , @entity82 , took five children across @entity12 on public transport to go riding			1
her aim was to help them improve their life skills , education and aspirations by providing access to horse riding , outdoor activities and mentoring			0
by 2006 more than 80 youngsters were involved and two years ago the club opened permanent stables for 135 in @entity267 , @entity10 , one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in @entity270 and in the top 15 wards in @entity12 for crime			2
many of the club members have never seen , let alone sat , on a horse and are often children with special educational needs , those at threat of expulsion and exclusion from school or in general need of support			2
they are taught skills including punctuality , regular attendance , commitment to improvement and team work in addition to developing a love of riding			2
