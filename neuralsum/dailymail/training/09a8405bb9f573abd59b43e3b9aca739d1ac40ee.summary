the sites - at @entity14 in @entity15 and @entity16 in @entity17 - were once bustling , employing around 2,000 each			1

it seems the mining industry is on the brink of extinction after the government announced two of the three last remaining mines are to be wound down by autumn 2015 - including @entity30 ( pictured ) ministers have decided there was ' no case for investment ' and have agreed to a £ 10 million loan , alongside £ 10 million from the private sector , to ' manage the closure ' of the mines the sites - at @entity14 in @entity15 and @entity16 in @entity17 - were once bustling , employing around 2,000 each			1
today the sites , operated by @entity0 's largest coal producer , @entity20 , employ 1,300 people but now it seems the mining industry is on the brink of extinction after the government announced they are to be wound down by autumn 2015			1
the government 's move to manage the closure , spares the company the prospect of immediate insolvency which would have cost the @entity51 ' significant losses and liabilities ' from redundancies and unpaid taxes			2

the government 's move to manage the closure , spares the company the prospect of immediate insolvency which would have cost the @entity51 ' significant losses and liabilities ' from redundancies and unpaid taxes people gather at the entrance to @entity69 in 2011 , where two men became trapped in debris inside the @entity15 pit ' however , deep coal mining remains an inherently risky business			1
there is no value for money case for a level of investment that would keep the deep mines open beyond this managed wind - down period to autumn 2015			2
' private sector investors who wish to put in the substantial investment that would be needed to maintain the mines beyond autumn 2015 without government support remain free to do so			1
' mr @entity55 said the government intended to participate in a private sector - led consortium ' to avoid the immediate insolvency of @entity20 '			1
the proposal , which ministers have been considering since march 21 , would see the deep pits face a phased shutdown and @entity20 ’s six surface mines sold off			2
mr @entity55 told @entity57 that the government ’s agreement to participate was subject to final terms ' that provide adequate protection to taxpayers ' as well as assurance of backing from all parties including trade unions			0

@entity30 , @entity17 , was the site of rioting in 1984 after a worker was killed a lone miner passes a line of police outside @entity30 , @entity17 , to go to work miners at @entity116 , @entity17 , pictured in 1947 mr @entity55 said directors of @entity20 had approached the government at the end of january to report that a falling coal price , exchange rates and other factors meant that ' the viability of the business was potentially in doubt '			1
it is understood that private sector investment will come from rival mining group @entity128 and @entity129 , landlord of the two mines			1
mr @entity55 said in a separate statement : ' we are doing everything we can to help in this unique situation			0
' our commercial loan , as part of this private sector - led initiative , can support a managed closure that is in the best interests of the taxpayer and employees			1
the only alternative was immediate insolvency			0
' it has been a real collective effort to get to this point , but this remains a challenging situation and all parties need to continue working closely together			0
' coal distribution in @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 @entity0 's coal industry was once the biggest employer in the country , when the pits were at the centre of communities whose way of life revolved around them			0
the hard but honourable work , at its peak - when coal was king - employed around 1 million people			0
by the time @entity170 nationalised the industry in 1947 , it still employed 750,000 people			0
but the consumption of domestic coal began to fall with the discovery of @entity177 gas			0
soon the country 's mining pits were closing down at an alarming rate			0
when widespread industrial action was triggered in march 1984 by plans to close 20 loss - making pits , there were 180 pits , each employing around 1,000 workers			2
