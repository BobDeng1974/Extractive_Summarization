by @entity0 last updated at 2:03 pm on 21st october 2011 killer : @entity2 , a drifter who confessed to killing three people during a week - long crime spree , will get a new trial to decide whether he should face the death penalty a judge has thrown out a death penalty sentence against a man convicted of killing three people during a week - long crime spree in @entity11 ten years ago			1
chief @entity11 district judge @entity12 ruled that @entity2 was denied his constitutional right to have his sentence decided by an impartial jury and that he is ' entitled to a new trial to determine whether the death penalty is justified in his case			1
' @entity2 , a drifter who was raised in @entity20 , pleaded guilty to carjacking two @entity22 men after each picked him up hitchhiking			2
he said he forced both men to drive to secluded spots , assured them he only wanted to steal their cars , then stabbed them repeatedly and slit their throats			1
he then fled to @entity28 , broke into a house in @entity30 and strangled a third man			2
the judge 's decision was angrily denounced by the father of @entity35 , one of @entity2 's victims			1
' i wish i could say i was surprised , ' @entity37 said			2
' i 'm not surprised , i 'm extremely disappointed and phenomenally outraged at the fact that one man tried to overturn the good work done by so many people in coming to the right decision many years ago			1
' in a motion for a new trial , @entity2 's lawyers argued that three jurors had given inaccurate answers to questions they were asked during the jury selection process			2
@entity12 found that one of the jurors had intentionally and repeatedly answered questions dishonestly in an attempt to avoid talking about subjects that were painful to her			1
she never disclosed , for example , that allegedly her husband had a rifle and had threatened to shoot her , that she had ended her marriage because of her husband 's substance abuse and that her daughter had served time in prison because of a drug problem			2
victims : @entity69 , left , @entity35 and @entity70 @entity12 said in his ruling that if the woman had disclosed those things during the jury selection process , the court would have found that there was a ' high risk ' that after listening to the evidence at @entity2 's trial , her decision on whether to sentence @entity2 to death could have been influenced by her life experiences			1
@entity12 said the woman would likely have been excused from serving on the jury			2
' in essence , despite dedicated efforts by the parties and the court to assure that the trial would be fair and the verdict final , it has now been proven that perjury by a juror resulted in a violation of @entity2 's constitutional right to have the issue of whether he should live or die decided by twelve women and men who were each capable of deciding that most consequential question impartially , ' wrote @entity12 , who presided at @entity2 's trial			1
but mr @entity35 disagreed with the reasoning , saying that he does not believe @entity12 's decision was based on a desire to get it right			1
controversial decision : chief @entity11 district judge @entity12 ruled that @entity2 was denied his constitutional right to have his sentence decided by an impartial jury ' i believe judge @entity12 is trying what he thinks is good for his image and himself , he does n't care about anybody else , ' he said			1
' it 's clear it 's been on his agenda for six years based on his action since the trial ended to do everything he could to ensure this is overturned and did not happen on his watch			2
' i 've heard and seen so many things from the judge over the years to be surprised at this , but , again , unfortunately , i 'm very disappointed in the outcome			1
' i feel terribly for the jurors who found themselves in this position through , i do n't think , any willful deceit on their part			0
' @entity2 was the first person sentenced to death in @entity22 under the federal death penalty law			0
@entity22 , which does not have a state law permitting the death penalty , has not executed anyone in more than half a century			0
@entity2 pleaded guilty to federal charges in the carjacking and killing of @entity35 , a 19 - year - old college student from @entity136 , and @entity69 , 69 , of @entity137 , in july 2001			0
a federal jury in @entity139 recommended the death penalty after hearing weeks of gruesome testimony about the killings			1
separately , @entity2 pleaded guilty in state court in @entity28 in the killing of @entity70 , 58 , of @entity145 , a former city councilor			0
@entity2 received a life sentence in @entity148 's death			0
' @entity149 has admitted to the cold - blooded murders of @entity69 , @entity35 and @entity70			0
today 's order does not change that fact , ' @entity11 attorney @entity151 said in a statement			1
@entity155 said prosecutors will meet with the victims ' families to discuss the ruling and plan to ' examine all of our legal options			0
' new trial : @entity2 's lawyers argued that three jurors had given inaccurate answers to questions they were asked during the jury selection process @entity168 , a spokeswoman for @entity155 , said : ' we are strongly considering an appeal as one of the options			1
' but mr @entity35 said he was not sure whether he could go through a trial again			0
' i do n't know how i 'd do that , how to do that at the moment , ' he said			0
' i ca n't imagine dragging all that drama and all of those things , how that 'd feel - to drag all that stuff to the surface again and have to deal with it for what would be the fourth or fifth time for us , given all the hearings we 've been through			0
' during the trial 's sentencing , @entity2 's lawyers said he was abused as a child and suffered from bipolar disorder , damage to the frontal lobe of his brain , and drug and alcohol addiction			0
former @entity11 attorney @entity196 , who brought the case against @entity2 , said he is disappointed that @entity2 will get a new death penalty hearing			1
' i feel horrible for the victims ' families , ' mr @entity196 said			0
' @entity2 is an admitted cold - blooded killer and he deserves the death sentence that the jury imposed , ' he said			0
@entity12 had ordered that the execution be carried out in @entity28 - the closest state with a death penalty - to make it more accessible to @entity2 's victims			0
@entity28 has a death penalty , although it has n't executed anyone since 1939 .			0
