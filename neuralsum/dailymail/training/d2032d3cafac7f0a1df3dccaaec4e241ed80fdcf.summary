@entity0 , 42 , aroused suspicion among his neighbours as he lived in a large gated house and drove a flashy @entity14 , yet hung around in tracksuits and appeared to be unemployed			0
when detectives raided his £ 500,000 home in @entity19 they were astonished to learn that this was far from the full extent of his dishonestly acquired wealth			2
it emerged that he had also secretly built the ‘ enormous ’ £ 2.3million mansion in northern @entity9 , when police came across the architect ’s plans			1
@entity0 was jailed for four years last week after pleading guilty to defrauding the @entity7 tax authorities out of nearly £ 450,000 over nine years			1
police struggled to create a detailed picture of his finances , as he was careful to use cash wherever possible and possessed few assets			0
relatives owned his family home in the @entity39 area of @entity19 , and only small amounts of money passed through his bank accounts			0
he claimed that he earned no more than £ 40,000 a year from a job as a debt collector , and other business interests			1
but detectives found no evidence that he was a legitimate debt collector , and calculated his income must have been at least £ 1million over the nine - year period to fund his lavish lifestyle in the @entity7 alone			1
they also discovered he had handled huge amounts of bank notes – as much as £ 120,000 on one occasion – and had paid for expensive cars in cash , spending £ 22,000 on a black @entity14			0

the investigation found @entity0 had pocketed £ 1.19million over nine years , and failed to pay @entity79 more than £ 445,000 in tax and @entity81			1

it is the size of @entity3			0
’ @entity100 said @entity0 was seen as ‘ untouchable ’ by some members of his community , but had been brought to justice thanks to its officers ’ painstaking work			0
detective inspector @entity107 added : ‘ the nature of @entity0 ’s offending meant that this was a particularly complex investigation in which detectives had to piece together information from a range of sources – including satellite imaging data on the property – to secure charges			0
' @entity0 ’s bank accounts bore no resemblance to his day - to - day - living			0
