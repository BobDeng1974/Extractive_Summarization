no trace of the plane has been found more than a week after it vanished but investigators believe it was diverted by someone with deep knowledge of the plane and of commercial navigation			1
@entity7 prime minister @entity76 said on saturday evidence pointed to a deliberate diversion of the flight , given the controlled way it was apparently turned around and flown far to the west of its original route from @entity85 to @entity86			2
@entity88 footage captures captain @entity24 , pilot of the @entity90 flight , being frisked while walking through security at @entity92 artists express hope : students gather around a three dimensional artwork , based on the missing @entity24 , that was painted on a school ground in @entity98			1

as an engineer specializing in executive jets , @entity6 would not necessarily have all the knowledge needed to divert and fly a large jetliner			2
@entity6 had said he worked for a @entity123 - based jet charter firm called @entity124 , but the company declined to say whether it still employed him			1
in a picture posted on @entity6 's @entity128 account in 2011 , he identified himself as an employee of @entity124 's @entity7 operations			0

he declined to say whether he believed his son could have been involved in any foul play			0
possible last known position of @entity24 @entity6 said he and other family members were supposed to visit @entity6 's new house this month			2

he would come visit us at least once a month , ’ @entity6 said			0
probe : police in @entity7 have searched the home of pilot @entity24 ( right ) and @entity24 ( left ) after officials confirmed the plane was taken over by a ' deliberate act ' the final picture : the missing jet is pictured here in february this year above @entity187 airspace the final words - ' all right , good night ' - from the missing @entity2 flight were spoken after its communication equipment was disabled , it has been revealed , as footage emerged showing the aircraft 's pilots walking through security for the final time before take - off			1
these words from the cockpit of the missing plane were spoken - believed to be by co-pilot @entity24 - as it was leaving @entity7 - run airspace and being handed over to air traffic controllers in @entity205			1
the sign - off came after one of the plane 's data communication systems , which would have enabled it to be tracked beyond radar coverage , had been switched off , @entity7 's acting transport minister @entity56 said on sunday			2
the informal hand - off went against standard radio procedures , which would have called for him to read back instructions for contacting the next control centre and include the aircraft 's call sign , said @entity218 , a former @entity219 pilot and a @entity220			0
investigators are likely to examine the recording for any signs of psychological stress .			0
