by @entity0 published : 20:55 est , 1 march 2014 updated : 23:02 est , 1 march 2014 @entity2 pulled out of a keynote speech yesterday as the controversy raged over her alleged links to a paedophile group			1
the @entity8 deputy leader had been expected to make the closing speech at a special party conference called to approve @entity12 ’s bid to reforge the party ’s relationship with the trade unions			1
she sat on the conference platform but failed to speak and mr @entity12 ended up addressing the packed event twice			1
silent partner : @entity2 next to @entity12 at the conference yesterday the conference overwhelmingly backed mr @entity12 ’s plans for a new ‘ one member , one vote ’ party leadership election system and an end to union members being automatically ‘ affiliated ’ to @entity8			1
miss @entity2 ’s silence took the gloss off @entity8 ’s announcement last night that ex-foreign secretary @entity30 , who famously turned his back on the party in 1981 to form the @entity33 , was once more backing @entity8 after yesterday ’s move			1
@entity30 praised mr @entity12 for a ‘ brave and bold reform ’ and said he had made a donation of more than £ 7,500 to the party , although he stopped short of rejoining			1
the rule change came amid mounting pressure on @entity40 , former legal officer for the @entity41 , to apologise over its connections with a vile group that campaigned to legalise sex with children			1
@entity30 praised mr @entity12 for a ' brave and bold reform ' and said he had made a donation of more than £ 7,500 to the party by @entity49 a senior civil servant who worked under former labour home secretary @entity51 is at the centre of an investigation into whether government money was used to fund the @entity55 was assistant secretary in charge of the @entity58 ’s @entity57 which , it is alleged , funnelled tens of thousands of pounds to the @entity61			1
a mail on sunday investigation has uncovered that lifelong bachelor @entity55 , a former @entity65 minister who died in 2006 , is the focus of a @entity58 inquiry over claims that large sums were given to the group in grants			0
after leaving the @entity58 , @entity55 wrote a paper arguing that the age of consent for homosexuals should be lowered in line with heterosexuals and another on homosexuality in classical @entity78 , looking at relationships between men and under - age boys			0
the shocking allegations were first revealed by this paper last year , as @entity58 permanent secretary @entity84 , launched an urgent investigation			2
that investigation is now believed to be considering claims that tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers ’ money could have been channelled by @entity55 and the @entity57 to the @entity61 , mostly while @entity51 was home secretary between 1976 and 1979			0
a @entity58 spokesman said : ‘ we are aware of the allegations and the permanent secretary has commissioned a thorough , independent investigation			0
’ miss @entity2 , who worked for the @entity41 from 1978 to 1982 , has expressed ‘ regret ’ over its links to the @entity61 but refused to apologise			2
she arrived at the @entity8 conference at @entity97 ’s @entity96 with husband and fellow @entity8 mp @entity99			1
he also faces questions over his role in the civil rights group , to which the @entity61 was affiliated from 1975 to 1983			0
miss @entity2 , who sat next to mr @entity12 , had been expected to round up the debate with a traditional rousing speech			2
her place was taken by @entity8 mp @entity106 while mr @entity12 ’s second speech closed the event			1
last night , a spokeswoman for @entity40 said her participation had never been set in stone			2
she said : ‘ it was never fixed			0
’ the programme change came as many @entity114 continue to express private anger over @entity40 ’s handling of the @entity41 row			1
she has insisted she ‘ never had anything to do with @entity61 ’ and that she is the victim of a ‘ politically motivated smear campaign ’			0
but she was left isolated when former @entity8 government colleague @entity120 , who was general secretary of the @entity41 from 1974 to 1983 , last week admitted it had been ‘ naive and wrong ’ in its dealings with @entity61			1
mr @entity99 , an @entity41 executive committee member in the 1970s , has denied claims he did not do enough to try to expel the paedophile group and insists he challenged @entity61 at the council ’s 1976 conference			1
mr @entity12 has made reforming the party ’s trade union links a litmus test of his leadership , even though he won the 2010 contest largely thanks to union support			1
the changes , sparked by the alleged rigging of a party candidate selection by the @entity136 in @entity137 , mean the next @entity8 leader will be elected by a one member , one vote system , rather than through the electoral college in which unions have a third of the vote			1
and instead of being automatically affiliated to @entity8 , union members will in future be invited to opt in as a party supporter for £ 3			1
delegates backed the plans , with 86 per cent voting in favour			2
@entity152 , boss of the giant @entity136 union , expressed defiance saying the changes would not mean the end of union influence over @entity8			1
‘ this is our party and we are going nowhere , ’ he said			0
by @entity161 - former @entity160 former @entity8 adviser @entity161 writes @entity12 hoped the conference would be his ' clause 4 moment ' @entity12 had hoped yesterday ’s @entity8 special conference would prove to be his clause 4 moment			1
unfortunately , it did n’t work out like that			0
he gave quite a good speech about getting people to re-engage with the political process			0
there was some decent mocking of @entity173 ’s attempt to rebrand himself leader of ‘ the @entity175 ’			0
but although he managed to put a brave face on it , yesterday was the day @entity8 ’s leader marched his troops to the top of the hill and then marched them swiftly back down again			1
or , more accurately , it was the day he marched his troops to the top of the hill and then allowed @entity136 leader @entity152 to march them back down to the @entity96 in @entity97 ’s @entity184			2
in the @entity187 ’s @entity186 2 there was a sense of being at a rather low - key motivational conference			2
or a slightly more upbeat humanist wedding			0
somewhere on the road to @entity184 , @entity12 has managed to lose his way			2
and it ’s worth remembering where the journey began			0
in the aftermath of the @entity137 scandal – where @entity136 was found to have attempted to rig the candidate selection for the safe @entity8 seat – an enraged @entity12 threw down the gauntlet to the unions			1
they had been practising what he called : ‘ a politics that was closed			0
a politics of the machine			0
a politics that is rightly hated			0
’ turning his fire directly on @entity136 ’s leader , he ratcheted up the rhetoric : ‘ instead of defending what happened in @entity137 , [ @entity152 ] @entity152 should be facing up to his responsibilities			0
he should not be defending the machine politics involving bad practice and malpractice that went on there , he should be facing up to it			0
’ then @entity12 set out his terms			2
the union ’s financial stranglehold on his party would finally have to be broken			2
trade union members would have to make a conscious decision to sign up directly to @entity8 , by - passing the general secretaries			1
and he would bring an end to the days when those general secretaries could spend limitless sums endorsing the leadership campaigns of their favoured candidates			0
this was all combative , indeed , historic stuff			0
but rather than drive forward with his reforms – as @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 did – @entity12 has engaged in a series of subtle , and not so subtle , tactical @entity238 funding proposals will not now be implemented until 2018 or 2019			2
in other words , never			0
the requirement to ask individual trade union members to ‘ opt in ’ to membership of the party has been placed in the hands of an ‘ @entity244 ’ that will not report until some point towards the end of the year			1
and the spending cap on elections has been shelved all together			0
somewhere on the road to @entity184 , @entity12 managed to lose his way - writes @entity161 , who attended the special conference even the commitment to introducing one member , one vote to leadership elections – the one significant move for which @entity12 does deserve credit – is not all that it seems			1
by abolishing the rights of his mps to influence those elections , and knocking down the electoral college wall between ‘ ordinary ’ @entity8 members and trade unionists , he has in effect increased the size of the votes in the control of the unions from 33 per cent to around 60 per cent			1
all of which is why , when it came to the crunch , @entity152 raised the card containing his union ’s mighty block vote and gave @entity12 ’s ‘ reform ’ plans a fair wind			1
tellingly , @entity8 ’s leader made no mention in either of his speeches to the events in @entity137 that had precipitated this special conference			1
but , in an equally telling intervention , @entity152 did			0
‘ my union has done nothing wrong , ’ he declared to loud cheers			0
before pointedly adding : ‘ this is our party and we are going nowhere			0
’ and he ’s right			0
nor , for that matter , is @entity12			2
yesterday was billed as the most historic constitutional turning point for @entity8 in almost a century			2
the fact is that as the @entity137 crisis swirled around him , @entity12 panicked , and made a series of commitments he was unable to deliver			2
everything since then has been an exercise in helping him extricate himself from the hook he ’d clumsily impaled himself on .			0
