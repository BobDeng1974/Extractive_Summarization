' that trust was violated when you elected to freely and willingly have sex with one of your students , no matter what the circumstances were surrounding your acceptance of the fact that you were going to have sex with this young man			2
the victim has been greatly impacted by this			0
he switched schools and is seeking therapy			0
' taking everything into consideration and including the fact that you violated the trust placed in you as a teacher of students , particularly the age of these students — we 're talking about eighth grade — the higher end of the guidelines is appropriate , ' judge @entity55 added			1

i do n't feel the judge knows the file like i do , ' @entity89 said			2

there has been much said out there about how lucky the victim is , and that this is not a big deal , but this is a big deal to not only the victim , but also his parents , ' the statement read			0
' this crime is a crime of selfishness and a betrayal of trust ... she used a student and she used a child to satisfy whatever selfish needs or issues that she was trying to address			2
i think it 's important not only to the parents , but to the victim in this case , and the community at large that when you betray trust in this fashion that there should be a severe penalty			0
