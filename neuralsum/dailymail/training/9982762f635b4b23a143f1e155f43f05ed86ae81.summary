dress with balloon detail from @entity39 @entity3 , whose daughter @entity91 is just four - months - old said : ' as a new mum i ’m conscious of how lucky i am , but also of how hard it can be for those who are bringing up children in tough conditions ; where things like food , water and basic healthcare are n’t guaranteed			1
looking smart at the event in a suit and nude heels she added : ' i ’m proud to be involved in the launch of the kids ’ @entity16 today , there ’s so many clothes here i want to buy for my little one , and want to encourage mums and grandmas across the @entity7 to continue to help the cause by delving into the back of their wardrobes and pulling out old and unworn items of clothing which can be shwopped			2
by taking these items to @entity31 stores nationwide we can raise money for @entity15 's @entity52 and all play a part in helping mums worldwide lift themselves and their families out of poverty			2
' @entity30 said of her support for the campaign : ' it is a strange but true fact that the smaller the human being , the more clothes they inevitably need			1
our children grow so quickly that the clothes we bought a week ago are often too small to be worn again			2
yet , we are often guilty of throwing these away or holding onto them as they hold emotional memories for us as new mums			0
' through shwopping we can now help mums that we may never meet , but through that old babygro that will never be worn again , we can be connected through our memories and our goodwill			0
' no clothing , no matter how small , should end up in landfill and harm the environment			0
dig deep into the back of the wardrobe , get that box from the cellar and schwop them … your small donation will have a huge impact on someone ’s life			0
