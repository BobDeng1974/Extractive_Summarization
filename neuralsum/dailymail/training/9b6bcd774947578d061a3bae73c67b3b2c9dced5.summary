the parents of a @entity2 private schoolgirl who travelled to @entity3 to join @entity5 fighters have begged for her to return home – but not before telling her she has ' betrayed ' the family			1
@entity9 , 20 , left her @entity11 home in november after becoming radicalised and fled to @entity3 where she married an @entity13 fighter , her family said			1
their desperate plea came the day after footage emerged of a second @entity17 journalist - @entity19 - being beheaded by extremists in the desert , and as the @entity22 hardened its stance against the brutal @entity24 amid terror warnings at home			2
her family described her today as ' sweet , peaceful and intelligent ' her parents , @entity36 and @entity28 , said they were horrified that their ' sweet , peaceful , intelligent ' child had joined jihadists in @entity3 and had hoped she would become a doctor in @entity45			1
in a statement issued today , they said she had ' betrayed ' the family but begged for her to return home			1
they said : ' we still love you , @entity52 , but we now have to put your family , your brother and sisters first as you have betrayed us , our community and the people of @entity2 when you took this step			1
' you have torn the heart out of our family and changed our lives forever			2
' they added : ' @entity64 was always a very sweet , peaceful , intelligent child and inquisitive about everything			1
' we had high hopes for her and would have loved for her to be a doctor and to save lives			1
' we dreamed that one day we would see her married with children but sadly that no longer looks likely			1
' we have not seen our daughter since november of last year and can confirm that on her disappearance we immediately contacted @entity75 and are grateful for their continued support			0
' we found out ourselves within days that she had travelled through @entity79 to @entity3 and subsequently married an @entity13 fighter in february this year			1
' as parents we would have liked for her to listen to us but we gave her everything possible in terms of love , freedom and education and she chose the path which we could never approve of			0
' all parents want to be proud of their children but sadly we now feel nothing but sorrow and shame for @entity52			1
at the press conference , her parents said she had been brought up ' with love and affection in a happy home ' ' we are not in denial and do not make any excuses for her and absolutely condemn her involvement in @entity13 and recent comments			1
' but she is our daughter and we still love her , fear for her life and would urge her to return home while she still can			1
' she may believe that the jihadists of @entity13 are her new family but they are not and are simply using her			2
' the couple also confirmed that their daughter had been keeping in touch with them through social media since fleeing @entity45 , but said they had not heard from her since yesterday when her involvement with @entity13 was revealed			1
mrs @entity9 wiped away tears as mr @entity30 read the statement on her and her husband 's behalf at a press conference in @entity11			1
mr @entity30 said : ' she contacted them by phone [ seven days after she left ] to tell them that she had reached [ @entity3 ] and then they contacted the police to say she had phoned from @entity3			2
' she informed her family that she went from @entity79 to @entity3 and that 's the information we have			2
' because of yesterday , all contact appears to have terminated with their daughter			0
' so , they are hoping that this plea will go out to their daughter and that she will think again and return home			1
' they want her to come home while she still can			0
they are telling her that she is wrong , that she is deluded if she thinks she is helping people in @entity3			2
' with regards to the practicalities of it and how exactly that was done , clearly she must have received assistance in order to do that , and the family are not naive , but everybody is well aware that those who are travelling into @entity3 are receiving assistance in order to do that			2
' in a message to @entity52 , @entity36 ( right ) and @entity28 ( left ) said : ' you have torn the heart out of our family and changed our lives forever			1
' they also said she had ' betrayed ' the family by fleeing to @entity3 the solicitor said @entity52 , a @entity45 national , had become ' concerned and upset ' by media and online reports of the killing in @entity3 and had told her parents she wanted to help			1
her parents , who are liaising with @entity75 , said : ' isis are killing in the name of religion and claiming to defend the weak , but by joining with them our daughter is brainwashed and deluded and helping those engaged in genocide			0
' there is no smoking gun , no family member , no fundamentalist preacher that can be blamed for her radicalisation			0
' @entity52 , like many young people in our community , was naturally angry and frustrated at the loss of innocent life in the @entity182 but this is not the way to help			2
' we are concerned that a growing climate of fear in this country means that children will not discuss how they feel with their family and friends , and this will only spell disaster for society			2
' we know that in the days and months ahead we will be scouring social media for clues of whether our daughter is still alive			0
' as we try to hold back the tears today , we feel we have lost our child			2
' mr @entity197 appeared emotionally defeated throughout the press conference and only occasionally clarified a few points with mr @entity30			0
responding to questions , mr @entity30 said @entity64 had left her brother and sisters ' distressed , upset and torn apart '			0
he added that while her family have branded her a ' bedroom radical ' , ' she is safe to return home and her family will open their door to her and take her back '			1
@entity64 's mother @entity28 sobbed throughout the press conference which was held in @entity11 , @entity2 , today in a statement @entity64 's parents said they had hoped she would become a doctor and wanted to see her married in reference to @entity217 's plans to void and seize the passports of extremists , mr @entity30 said that it would not apply to her as she does not have dual citizenship			1
he said that because @entity52 is a @entity45 national and ' not a dual national ' , she would not be affected by the proposals and so could ' return home at any time and that door is still open to her '			1
he said : ' my understanding is that the police are also saying that she should return before it 's too late			0
mr and mrs @entity9 also warned of others becoming radicalised in @entity45 , adding : ' if our daughter , who had all the chances and freedom in life , could become a bedroom radical , then it is possible for this to happen to any family			1
' privately - educated @entity64 is reported to have encouraged terrorist acts via a @entity242 account under the name @entity244 – which carries a picture of the black flag of brutal terrorist group @entity13			2
in a series of radical messages she encouraged others to copy the shocking murder of soldier @entity252 , the @entity253 and the massacre at the @entity256 base in @entity257			0
the account has since been deleted			0
she travelled through @entity79 to @entity258 in @entity3 in november and was reported missing to police			2
before disappearing she attended the prestigious private @entity260 before enrolling at @entity261 to study diagnostic radiology			0
she was ' well integrated into society ' , her parents said , and had been brought up ' with love and affection in a happy home '			0
@entity75 and the security services have previously confirmed they are aware of @entity52			0
the couple ( right ) were accompanied by their lawyer @entity30 ( left0 who read the statement to the press @entity36 and @entity28 walked hand - in - hand as they left the press conference in @entity11 today friends and family have previously told of their shock of her involvement with radical @entity5 and her decision to travel to @entity3			1
one ex-school friend said : ' she was n't different			0
she got on with everybody			0
as soon as she decided to do something she would never change her mind			0
i guess that was something that was amazing about her , but also one of her downfalls			0
' another school friend said she was a ' usual , typical girl ' , adding : ' at school she had a lot of friends			0
she was a really confident person , she could talk to anyone she wanted , clever as well			0
' ' i would say she was a moderate muslim			0
i find it really bizarre , knowing her from school and then her suddenly being part of @entity24			0
' friends did not know she had travelled to the @entity182 , although @entity197 , who was very interested in politics , had spoken about wanting to go there to ' help ' in the fight against @entity309 's regime			0
a security source said the @entity11 girl was one of an increasing number of western women travelling to @entity3 in order to provide a support network for organisations such as @entity24 .			1
