by @entity0 follow @ @ martinkeown5 @entity2 midfielder @entity1 is in line to sign for @entity4 for £ 20million this summer			1
the @entity6 midfielder will be @entity4 's ' go - to ' player and for that sort of money they will expect big things			2
here , @entity12 columnist @entity0 gives the lowdown on the 24 - year - old ... done deal : @entity4 have agreed a deal to sign @entity2 midfielder @entity1 for £ 20m the transfer @entity1 is a good bit of business for @entity4 , but he is only the first piece of the jigsaw			1
they still need to bring in reinforcements across the squad if they want to get back to where they were			0
however , a signing like this does show the power @entity4 still have			1
people questioned whether being out of the @entity32 next season would affect their ability to buy top names			0
well , here ’s your answer			0
it ’s good to get any transfers done before a @entity40 so that the player ’s mind is clear , and it ’s particularly helpful if that player goes on to play a starring role in the tournament			0
but it is interesting that a club like @entity2 was happy to let him go – you would have thought it would be any young @entity54 player ’s dream to want to stay and win trophies at the best club in the country			1
plenty of @entity60 clubs will have been interested in him but he is the marquee signing that could start the ball rolling for @entity4			2
green light : the deal to bring @entity1 to @entity67 , which was agreed when @entity68 was still in charge , has been given the go ahead by new boss @entity70 the player there is no doubting @entity1 ’ ability			2
he is a quality passer of the ball , he can defend and he has excellent vision			0
@entity4 want to play quick , incisive football and @entity1 is a good place to start			1
he keeps things simple , always has time in possession and with his range of passing , @entity4 will hope he could fill a @entity85 - shaped hole in their midfield			1
talent : @entity1 is a quality passer of the ball , can defend and has excellent vision and should fit in at @entity4 fill the gap : @entity4 will be hoping @entity1 is capable of filling the hole in midfield left by @entity85 his performance against @entity93 in the @entity32 made people sit up and take notice – he completed 147 passes , only 11 less than the entire @entity98 team put together – but it ’s important to remember he was playing against 10 men for a large part of that game			1
he also only scored four goals in 51 appearances this season , so he is not exactly prolific			0
sometimes he floats in and out of matches and with @entity107 often playing deep in that @entity2 midfield , @entity1 was not their go - to player			1
he will need to fulfil that role at @entity4			0
if he plays in a midfield two , and at the minute he would likely partner @entity113 , he would need to work on his mobility			0
@entity115 and @entity116 have set the benchmark for all - action midfield pairings and @entity4 have to find their own combination			2
@entity1 can be part of that but he will need an energetic partner			0
caught the eye : @entity1 ' performance against @entity93 in the @entity32 made people take notice back of the net ! @entity1 shoots and scores during @entity2 's last 16 victory over the @entity98 in february running the show : @entity1 ' heat map from february 's @entity134 encounter showed his dominance in midfield the manager @entity138 was obviously in no rush to keep @entity1 , and the @entity54 is not your typical @entity141 midfielder			1
he does not have as low a centre of gravity as the likes of @entity146 or @entity147 and plays in a slightly more upright style			0
but @entity1 does have the advantage of having worked under @entity70 before			0
it was the @entity152 who gave @entity1 his breakthrough at @entity2 in 2010 - 11 , and he will know about @entity155 ’ pedigree			1
the midfielder , too , will know all about @entity158 ’s attacking philosophy and also his colourful dressing room manner , which can only help him adapt to life in @entity161			0
it is a decent signing for @entity4 and the fans will be pleased to see that even though there is a lot of work to be done defensively with the squad , @entity158 ’s first instinct is still to focus on attacking football			2
former boss : new @entity4 manager @entity70 worked with @entity1 at @entity2 back in 2010			1

@entity1 in line to sign for @entity4 in £ 20million deal
signing @entity2 midfielder shows power @entity4 have
@entity0 *believes* @entity1 is the first piece of the @entity4 jigsaw
@entity4 will hope @entity54 can fill the hole in midfield left by @entity85
