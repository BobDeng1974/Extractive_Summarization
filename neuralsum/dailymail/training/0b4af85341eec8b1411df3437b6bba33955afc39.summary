by @entity0 , royal correspondent published : 06:48 est , 28 june 2013 updated : 17:51 est , 28 june 2013 just a day after it emerged that his mother was being given an inflation - beating five per cent pay rise , prince @entity2 ’s annual income is also on the up			1
thanks to record profits of £ 19 million from the @entity11 last year , the heir to the throne enjoyed an extra £ 763,000 in his ‘ pay packet ’ , an increase of four per cent			1
the rise was clearly welcome as @entity2 forked out around £ 1 million from his personal funds to meet the growing official activities of the @entity17 and @entity18 and prince @entity19			1
on the buses : the @entity19 has cut his travel bill , but is in line for a four per cent income boost @entity24 declined yesterday to comment on whether the prince is feeling the pinch			1
but he did make a point of cutting his personal spending – which includes everything from the salaries of his private chef and valets , to his and the @entity34 ’s weekly supermarket bill – by a substantial £ 200,000			2
that amounted to an eight per cent decrease , from £ 2.6 million to £ 2.4 million			2
a spokesman refused to be drawn on why or how , but in previous years aides have admitted the prince has looked at bringing down his day - to - day living expenses			0
his principle private secretary , @entity41 , said yesterday : ‘ it ’s a whole mixture of things to do with the way they live their lives			0
’ of his £ 19,051,000 annual income , @entity2 was able to write off more than half - £ 10,952,000 in all – against tax as business expenses			1
clever accounting means that the future king charges everything from the cost of his offices and staff to even the upkeep of his gardens at @entity58 , his private home in @entity59 which he also uses for official entertaining , as legitimate working expenses			0
boost : @entity2 saw his private income from the @entity11 rise by four per cent to £ 19 million to his credit , however , @entity2 continues to voluntarily pay tax , which last year saw a bill from the @entity66 for £ 4.42 million , marginally down on the previous year			1
he also received a 47 per cent decrease in funding from taxpayers to £ 1.15 million			2
this is because his travel bill was significantly cheaper last year , as many of the countries he visited – including @entity73 and @entity74 – also have the @entity75 as their head of state and therefore meet the costs of such tours themselves			1
details of the prince ’s public and private spending emerged in his annual review , released yesterday			0
it provides a fascinating insight into the heir to the throne ’s household , who works there and how much his lifestyle costs			2
his principle private secretary , @entity41 , described the last 12 months as an ‘ extraordinary year ’ and emphasised @entity2 ’s growing role on the international stage on behalf of his aging mother , who announced earlier this year she would be stepping back from long haul royal travel			0
mr @entity41 also admitted that should @entity41 and @entity18 decide to take on more royal duties in the coming years , then @entity2 may have to reconsider his decision to fund their official work			1
demands : prince @entity2 had to pay out £ 1 million from his personal funds to meet the growing official activities of the @entity19 and the @entity18 and @entity17 @entity103 of @entity34 ’s sister has been paid £ 1.2million over eight years by @entity2 for ‘ interior design services ’			1
@entity107 received £ 33,034 in ‘ fees and commission ’ last year , plus a further £ 7,160 for the purchase of furniture and furnishings by the @entity11 , the accounts show			1
in all , the interior designer has billed the prince a total of £ 1,198,629 since she was first commissioned by the estate in 2005 , the year @entity2 and @entity113 married			2
the @entity118 admits the contract for the work was not put out to tender			0
but it says that , as a private estate , it is not bound by normal commercial practices and is entitled to award work directly to the prince ’s sister - in - law			0
but he confirmed there were no immediate plans to do so , suggesting the prince , whose tour of duty as an @entity133 helicopter pilot ends in september , may decide to stay in the military a little longer despite growing pressure for him to become a full - time working royal			0
according to yesterday ’s figures the prince spent £ 212,000 on @entity24 , his @entity140 office and official residence and £ 644,000 on official travel by air and rail			2
he has the equivalent of 125.4 official full - time staff including 1.3 butlers , 4.3 chefs and kitchen porters , three chauffeurs , ten house managers and housekeepers and 20.2 garden and estate workers			0
he also employs 22.0 staff of a personal basis including 7.0 secretaries , chefs and valets and 15 ‘ estate , farm , garden and stable staff ’			0
@entity41 , @entity18 and @entity19 have a further 10.5 full - time office staff paid for by @entity2			1
the @entity118 of @entity34 is a private estate , a portfolio of agricultural land ( 53,154 hectares of land in 24 counties at last count ) and property such as the @entity172 cricket ground – both of which generate vast amounts of rent – as well as some shrewd financial investments			0
pay rise : @entity75 , pictured this week with the @entity179 in the gardens of @entity181 , is to receive a five per cent rise in income since 1337 , the estate ’s profits have been given to successive @entity19 as the equivalent of an annual income			1
@entity24 stressed yesterday the @entity2 voluntarily chose to use the majority of this money – some two - thirds in all – to fund his official duties , after which he plays income tax			2
but in recent years there has been growing criticism of this ‘ cosy ’ arrangement , which is not subject to either corporation or capital gains taxes			0
@entity198 ’s @entity197 , which has already hauled businesses including @entity200 and @entity201 over the coals , is due to question senior figures from the @entity118 and @entity24 over how it works next month .			0

@entity19 sees income from @entity11 rise by 4 **%**
but he paid out £ *1million* to meet costs of @entity17 and @entity18 and @entity19
queen in line for 5 **%** increase in income from the @entity215
