after @entity3 's double left @entity2 reeling on wednesday night , their @entity1 hopes are hanging by a thread			1
@entity5 insists that his team will keep fighting while their is still a mathematical possibility of qualification , but with just two points from four games , it looks a remote possibility			0
however , @entity2 can take hope from history - there have been two occasions where teams have made it out of the group from a similarly difficult position			1
@entity2 look down and out after their defeat to @entity22 , but history shows they have a chance @entity5 's side may only have two points from four games , but twice before that has been enough in the 2004 - 05 season @entity29 , coming into the tournament as reigning champions , had a shocking start to their defence			1
after being held to a stalemate at home to @entity22 in their first game , @entity29 went down 3 - 1 to their former manager @entity35 , in his first season at @entity37 , with @entity38 and @entity39 both on the scoresheet			1
and while @entity37 went on to dominate the group , the holders suffered a defeat to @entity44 in @entity45 , and were again scoreless at home in the return leg			2
@entity39 scores against @entity29 in 2004 , as the @entity1 holders suffered a slow start @entity39 and @entity38 were on target as @entity35 's former side looked like crashing out of the group after four games the @entity52 side had scored just one goal , and picked up two points - their attempt to retain the trophy looked all but over			1
but , with @entity59 leading the line , @entity58 's side bounced back , beating @entity22 1 - 0 and then @entity37 2 - 1 to finish with eight points , one ahead of the @entity62			2
the last 16 was not quite so kind to @entity29 , who lost 4 - 2 on aggregate to @entity65			0
@entity66 tackles @entity67 as @entity29 bounced back in their final two games to qualify @entity59 was the key man for @entity29 , scoring in the 1 - 0 win over @entity22 and the defeat of @entity37 @entity71 celebrates @entity29 's first goal against @entity37 , which helped book their place in the last 16 even more impressive than the @entity52 side 's feat is that of @entity77 three years earlier			1
when @entity78 scored for @entity79 at the @entity80 on matchday four , @entity77 had just a solitary point from four games			0
but the @entity62 side upset the odds by winning away to @entity84 and then completed the comeback by beating @entity86 2 - 0			0
@entity77 had just one point after four games , but beat @entity84 to keep their hopes alive in the end , despite their terrible start , @entity77 qualified relatively comfortably , two points ahead of the @entity92 , although they would go on to pick up just one point from their six games in the second group stage			2
while @entity2 can seek encouragement from these two examples from the continent , there is also one recovery from closer to home they might want to take as inspiration			2
in 2002 @entity104 's @entity103 looked down and out after four games , despite having just seen off @entity105			0
@entity106 scores a beauty for @entity105 against @entity103 , who lost their first three games in 2002 @entity104 's side looked out of the competition but they came back to beat @entity105 and qualify the @entity113 club knew they needed maximum points from their final two games - as @entity2 do now - and showed resilience and quality to beat @entity118 and @entity119			1
it 's a lesson that @entity5 is determined to learn			0
as the @entity121 put it on wednesday : ' you can never imagine you are out when the maths says you are still in			0
' @entity125 fires home a penalty as @entity103 became the first team to qualify after three straight losses @entity129 celebrates the winning goal during the final win against @entity119 that put @entity103 through			0

defeat to @entity22 leaves @entity2 bottom of their group
city need to win both games to have any chance of qualifying
but two teams have made it through from similar positions in @entity1 history
