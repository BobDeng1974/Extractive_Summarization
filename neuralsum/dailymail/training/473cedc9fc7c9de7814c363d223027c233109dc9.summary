by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 06:48 est , 31 july 2013 keeping your goldfish in a tank which contains plants and sculptures could make them cleverer , according to new @entity8 research			1
scientists at @entity11 , in @entity9 , discovered that fish benefit from being in ‘ enriched environments ’			1
they believe that their discovery could provide an insight into how to successfully repopulate our oceans and rivers			1
fish kept in tanks with hiding places and floating artificial plants showed signs of improved brain function and could better navigate mazes than the those in a less exciting environment professor @entity28 explained that currently a lot of fish that are bred in captivity do not survive once they are released into the wild			1
she said that , now , fisheries overcome this problem by breeding huge numbers of fish in the hope that some will survive			2
the professor believes that part of the reason so many of the fish die is that they are bred in ‘ pretty boring ’ tanks where there is always plenty of food and no predators meaning that they are totally unprepared for release			2
to test this hypothesis @entity28 bred 30 salmon in two separate tanks			0
one contained plants and rocks which were regularly changed to ensure the fish did not become bored , while the other was empty			0
conservation fish hatcheries are good at rearing lots of fish , but their survivability rate is low			0
@entity28 , professor of fisheries and biology , @entity11 , said that adding objects to make hatchery tanks more stimulating for the fish can make fish smarter and better adapted to survive in the wild in contrast , @entity28 said the hatchery world is homogenous : ‘ the water flow is the same , you do n't have to find your food and you do n't have to avoid predators			1
’ researchers discovered when fish were raised in the enriched tank , parts of their brains changed and they could escape from a maze quicker than fish raised in standard tanks when the researchers placed the salmon in a maze , the fish raised in the enriched tanks made fewer mistakes when trying to escape the maze			2
the performance of the salmon from the enriched tank continued to improve with each trial , and they learned to solve the maze much faster than fish reared the standard way			0
the brains of the fish from the enriched tank were also different from the fish raised in the standard hatchery tanks , according to the researchers			2
they noted increased expressions of a gene in a region of the fish 's brain that is associated with learning and memory , an indication of increased brain function and growth			1
@entity28 has concluded that interacting with the environment can influence gene expression in the brain			0
‘ if you want to make the environment more interesting for your fish , change things around a bit , ’ she told @entity116			0
‘ if you are a hobby aquarist , bring in some new ornaments for the tank			0

@entity8 study *suggests* fish in more stimulating environments are smarter
the fish kept in more exciting tanks developed better learning and memory
@entity133 could provide an insight into how to successfully repopulate our oceans and rivers
