with this much hair to contend with , bathtime was bound to have an extra twist			0
and when @entity4 needed to look his best for dog show @entity6 , which runs till sunday , it was never going to be a case of just ‘ wash and go ’			1
instead , an eight - hour clean - up operation ensued for the dread - locked @entity11 — involving three hours in the tub , then five more under a vast array of dryers			1
thankfully , placid @entity4 soaks up the attention as well as the suds			2
locks like i need a bath : a pre-grooming walk relaxes the sprightly five - year - old @entity4 suds - u - like : owner @entity22 does four - shampoos - and - rinse jobs , before a final conditioner is massaged in it takes a lot of water to lather @entity28 up , according to his owner the 10st 7lb five - year - old stands 33in to the shoulder and is one of around only 45 of his breed in the @entity35			1
puppies , which cost upwards of £ 1,200 , are born with downy coats that develop into dreadlocks ( or , to be correct , ‘ cords ’ )			2
komondors are known as ‘ the ultimate sheep - dog ’ in @entity43 , their country of origin , where their thick , shaggy hair protected them from the wolves and bears which threatened farmers ’ flocks			1
the cleaning process — at his owner @entity52 ’s dog grooming parlour — starts with @entity28 stepping into a hydrobath , which has a door for easy access			0
the first challenge is to get his dense coat wet enough			0
miss @entity52 , 52 , of @entity61 , @entity62 , said : ‘ it ’s quite wiry and coarse , so it takes a lot of water before you can lather him up			2
’ then its four shampoos and separate rinses before the conditioner goes on and a final rinse			0
a rubdown with a towel follows , plus a once - over with a ‘ wet - and - dry ’ vacuum cleaner to suck out as much water as possible			1
then it ’s out with the arsenal of hairdryers			0
they include a £ 300 @entity81 , which gusts cool air over @entity28 from its three large black hoses — and which is nicknamed ‘ @entity85 ’ by @entity84			2
‘ if we left him to dry naturally , it ’d probably take up to four days , ’ said @entity22 ’s partner @entity86 , 61 , who runs a courier business			0
high and dry : a hurricane of blowdryers slowly gets the komondor 's coat dried out finally , @entity4 slips into a fetching green onesie that helps keep his locks spotless and means he can carry on as normal until show day			0
@entity4 , whose pedigree name is @entity99 , will be at the @entity100 today in the working and pastoral breeds section , where he has previously won @entity102 in the @entity11 class			1
needless to say , this year he ’s hoping for a clean sweep of even more prestigious titles			0
on trend : a green onsie helps to stop a freshly blow - dried @entity4 picking up dirt like a damp mop @entity6 - ready : a primped and preened @entity4 is poised for the top spot - even if his podium is a little makeshift			1

clean - up operation for @entity6 of dread - locked @entity11 takes eight - hours
five - year - old @entity4 *spends* three hours in the tub and five more under dryers
komondors are known as ‘ the ultimate sheep - dog ’ in their native @entity43
@entity4 is competing at @entity6 and has previously won @entity102 in his class
