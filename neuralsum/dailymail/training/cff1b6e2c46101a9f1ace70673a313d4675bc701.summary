there can not have been many sportsmen who have risen as spectacularly as @entity2 and then been heartily booed by the bulk of his home crowd at the end of a breakthrough summer			1
but , then again , @entity2 is no ordinary cricketer			1
the @entity8 born - and - bred and very @entity10 muslim did not expect the torrent of abuse he received at @entity14 from the @entity16 supporting majority of the sell - out crowd when he played for @entity18 in their @entity20 international			1
after all , he was coming to the end of a season which saw him emerge as not only one of the most exciting talents in the @entity27 game but also the perfect role model for @entity29 from similar inner - city backgrounds			2
@entity18 all - rounder @entity2 expressed his disappointment at being booed in @entity8 over the summer yet the sheer scale of the booing , greater than that received by any other @entity27 cricketer with an @entity37 background and predominantly because of his @entity39 heritage , was evidence that he has much to do to convince those like him to follow him and embrace the domestic game			1
‘ i wo n’t say that it hurt but it was disappointing that i live 10 minutes from @entity14 and i ’m getting booed by people i feel i ’m supposed to represent , ’ said @entity2 at @entity44 as he prepared to join @entity18 ’s one - day tour of @entity46			1
‘ people have a right to support who they want , of course , but it was a big shame but i ’m hoping in the future maybe they or their kids will become @entity18 fans or players			1
it just made me feel that a lot more work needs to be done			0
’ if @entity2 was not hurt by the reception then his father @entity60 , himself born in @entity8 and a tireless worker for disadvantaged youngsters in the area through his academy , certainly was			1
‘ my dad was very upset because it was the first time the family had watched me play for @entity18 at @entity14 , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ i do n’t know what it was			0
maybe because my family are from @entity72			0
i actually think alcohol played a large part but i ’ll never forget it and i was just glad to field the last ball when we won			0
’ so what more can be done to convince more @entity29 to support the country of their birth ? ‘ i ’ve thought about it and i think players like myself and @entity84 need to get out there and tell people that it is about playing for our country and that means playing for @entity18			2
@entity2 revealed that his dad was ' very upset ' at the abuse he received from those in the @entity94 ‘ sometimes in @entity37 homes it is about where we ’ve come from , which is important too , but it is about where you live and where you ’re born and the people who are the same as you			2
the thing is , when you play in @entity106 they cheer everybody and i ’ve had @entity16 friends sort of apologise to me about what happened			0
but there ’s definitely more that people like me can do			0
’ another controversy to affect @entity2 last summer was his decision to wear @entity116 wristbands during @entity18 's @entity117 against @entity106 at @entity118 , a move which led to him being ticked off by the @entity119			1
@entity2 is set to star for @entity18 at february 's @entity121 ' i still have my views and opinions but i must be more wary of expressing them on the field , ' said @entity2			1
' i still believe what i believe in			0
a guy paid £ 500 for them for the charity of his choice and i had dinner with him in @entity8			2
i was pleased some good came out of it			0
' he has done quite a lot already both on and off the field , not least in impressing with bat , notably a maiden test century of rare class against @entity46 , and with the ball in taking 19 wickets in the 3 - 1 success against @entity106			2
now he is part of an @entity18 squad that leave for @entity46 on sunday for a seven - match 50 - over series that serves as a warm - up for a @entity121 in @entity147 and @entity148 in the @entity149 that few expect them to thrive in			1
@entity2 believes that @entity18 can exceed expectations by abandoning the traditional cautious mind - set and replacing it with a fearless approach			1
‘ i know a lot of people are writing us off but i feel we have a good chance because of the amount of one - day cricket we are now playing before then			0
‘ i did n’t play in the first three games of our series against @entity106 so i watched the way they batted and the biggest thing i got out of that was how fearless they were			0
they just went out and backed themselves and you could see a massive difference in the way they batted compared to us			0
they really express themselves and that ’s what we need to do too			0
’ @entity2 , 27 , is a candidate to bat at three in @entity46 and the @entity121 or fill an all - rounder ’s role at seven but what he would really like is to go in at the very top			1
‘ i ’d love to open , ’ said @entity2 , who could become an alternative to @entity183 as @entity185 ’s partner if the big - hitting @entity187 man does not come off			1
‘ i ’ve done that for much of my career at @entity190			0
i know there are people who have opened longer than me with better records but that ’s my long - term aim			0
’ when @entity2 burst on to the scene post @entity18 ’s @entity197 disaster much was made of his ability as an off - spinner to bowl the doosra , the ball that goes away from the right - hander , but it was rarely seen while he was bamboozling @entity106 and now he has reluctantly put it back in his locker , probably for good			1
@entity2 impressed hugely with the ball during a summer of ups and downs for @entity206 ' @entity18 @entity207 targets odi place a crackdown on unorthodox actions by the @entity119 has seen a number of spinners , notably @entity2 ’s mentor @entity213 , banned from bowling and the all - rounder does not want to risk going the same way			1
‘ i ’m not going to bowl it because of the scrutiny , ’ said @entity2 , who confounded suggestions that he was only a ‘ part - time ’ spinner throughout his fruitful summer			1
‘ i do n’t want to risk not playing for @entity18 because of that			2
‘ it ’s a shame because personally i feel it is a great skill to turn the ball both ways as an off - spinner and i always thought the doosra was a great innovation but i do n’t want to be banned			0
at the moment i do n’t feel i need it anyway			0
’ not if he carries on as he has done this year he wo n’t			0
and maybe it he does then even his home crowd will cheer @entity2			2
