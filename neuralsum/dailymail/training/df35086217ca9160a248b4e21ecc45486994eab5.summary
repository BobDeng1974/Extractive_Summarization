by @entity0 published : 04:36 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 15:35 est , 20 june 2013 the artistic director of the @entity2 is now almost completely blind after 18 operations failed to save his sight following an acid attack earlier this year			2
@entity6 , 42 , was left with severe burns to his eyes and face when a masked attacker threw a jar of sulphuric acid in his face as he was returning home late on january 17			1
he flew to @entity15 from @entity16 for treatment in march , but despite initial optimistic reports , he has now lost 95 per cent of his vision and is totally blind in his right eye			1
he had previously spoken of his desire to return to work , but now the prognosis looks bleak a spokeswoman for the @entity2 told the @entity29 yesterday : ' he is now blind in his right eye			2
the problem is that it is acid and it continues to cause damage			0
he has had 18 operations and i understand that some of them were very difficult			0
' she said that his facial burns had almost completely healed and his hair had grown back			0
the spokeswoman also said that he continues to speak regularly on company business to @entity42 , who has been standing in for him			0
the dancer : @entity44 , 29 , - known as ' @entity45 ' for his talent for playing ballet villains - was remanded in custody until at least june 18 as the probe goes on into the scandal the @entity2 , one of @entity53 's best - known cultural symbols , filed two reprimands against @entity55 for giving unauthorised interviews after the attack on mr @entity6			1
when he arrived at @entity58 , mr @entity6 said he was ' full of strength and faith ' that he will eventually see well enough to return to work at the famed @entity16 theatre			1
but it appears his progress has now stalled and the prognosis for his sight is now bleak			0
@entity44 , 29 , - known as ' @entity45 ' for his talent for playing ballet villains - is accused of paying a ' hitman ' £ 1,080 to attack @entity6 after his girlfriend was snubbed for a role			1
but while @entity44 has admitted ordering the attack , he argues he only wanted @entity6 ' beaten up ' and did not sanction the use of sulphuric acid			1
an alleged accomplice , @entity73 , is accused of accepting 50,000 roubles , around £ 1,080 , from @entity44 to attack mr @entity6			1
in april a judge in @entity16 rejected his plea to be released on bail pending the results of a police investigation , deeming him a flight risk			1
allegations : @entity44 ( right ) is said top have ordered the attack after his ' partner ' @entity84 ( right ) was snubbed for a role arrests : alleged masked attacker @entity92 ( left ) and @entity93 ( right ) , the driver who took part in attack on @entity6 , have both confessed to their involvement , police say he was remanded in custody until at least june 18 as the probe goes on into the scandal			1
as the biggest scandal in the history of @entity53 ballet , the case has gripped @entity53 as revelations exposing the internal rifts tearing the classical dance world apart as well as a string of murky sub-plots			0
police claim @entity44 was motivated by fury at @entity109 for snubbing his girlfriend , 21 - year - old @entity84			0
' the main reason he gave to the investigator is revenge , ' a police source told @entity53 newspaper @entity115			0
' @entity6 did not let her play leading dancing roles in the @entity2			1
' but @entity44 - who faces up to 12 years in jail if found guilty - claimed at an earlier court hearing that he was horrified when he realised that acid was used in the 17 january attack on @entity6			1
' when i heard what happened to @entity6 , i was just in shock , ' he said			2
' i could not believe that the man who proposed beating him up went ahead and did this thing with acid			2
dancer : sources say that @entity44 may been upset about the treatment of his @entity2 partner @entity84 , 21 , pictured above ' i did not order harm done to this man			2
' however , @entity44 and accomplices evidently also hacked 16,000 emails of top @entity2 figures as he sought to prove that @entity6 demanded a percentage of fees obtained by troupe members in tv or sponsored dancing engagements outside the theatre			2
it is unclear exactly when @entity44 's trial will begin as police continue to investigate			0
earlier this month the principal ballet dancer with the @entity146 claimed he was being forced out of the troupe over allegations that he was part of the acid attack @entity55 , 39 , has been told he must leave at the end of the month amidst claims by @entity2 director @entity153 that he may have been involved			0
crisis : general view of the hall from the @entity146 stage in @entity16 - the attack on @entity6 plunged the @entity2 into a grave crisis mr @entity55 's relationship with mr @entity153 soured sharply after the @entity2 director suggested that the @entity163 - born dancer might have played a role inciting the attack			1
mr @entity55 , who has been at the @entity2 since 1992 as principal dancer and teacher , hit back saying the manager was conducting a witch hunt against him			0
' this is hounding of the sole and most famous artist of the @entity146 , ' the dancer said			0
the principal dancer has now been told that his contract will not be renewed when it expires at the end of june , @entity2 spokeswoman @entity174 said , but refused to give the reason for the decision			0
the @entity2 , one of @entity53 's best - known cultural symbols , filed two reprimands against @entity55 for giving unauthorised interviews after the attack on mr @entity6			2
