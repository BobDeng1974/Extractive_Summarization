master patissier @entity0 is on - stage recalling how he once refused to bake a ' very rude ' cake for @entity3			1
' her @entity4 said : " but it 's for @entity3 ! " i told her that i did n't care if it was for the @entity9 , ' says @entity0			1
learning from the master : @entity11 shows off the cooking skills she has picked up from @entity0 as it happens , when @entity14 toured the cruise ship britannia after the naming ceremony last month , one of the areas she was most impressed with was @entity0 's atrium - based @entity19 , where the centrepiece is a beautiful , mouth - watering display : dainty , neon - hued raspberry macaroons , @entity24 served with popping candy and chocolate salted caramel mille - feuilles			1
@entity28 and @entity29 are some of the other foodies @entity32 's owners , @entity33 , have enlisted			1
at a dinner hosted by @entity0 in the @entity35 , i watch my canard à l'orange being prepared on a screen while @entity0 reels off anecdotes about baking one - ton cakes for sheikhs and having his bottom pinched by @entity29			1
then i sign up for a cookery lesson with him in the @entity35 , where wall - mounted screens are connected to cameras positioned over @entity0 's workspace , allowing us to follow his every move			2
i whip up a chocolate soufflé , although sadly , i later drop it face - down on the floor of my cabin			0
the 3,600 - passenger , @entity55 - adorned @entity32 is the largest ship built for the @entity59 market			1
my shore excursions on a dash around the @entity62 include a coach tour through @entity65 's snowy mountains above @entity66 , where we sample wild boar meat			2
all aboard : with a 3600 capacity , @entity32 is the biggest cruise ship built for the @entity59 market in @entity72 in @entity73 , guide @entity74 teaches us about traditional @entity73 cuisine on a wine and tapas tour , then shows us around the city 's @entity80 theatre			1
@entity32 basks in its @entity82			2
in @entity84 's , the pub , there are beers from 56 @entity59 counties and in the library an entire shelf is dedicated to the @entity59 monarchy			2
a handful of guests bemoan the lack of a wrap - around prom deck ( to walk off some of those calories ) but the intimate @entity96 , where you dine to a soundtrack of performances by singers such as @entity101 , and the @entity103 spa , with its hydrotherapy centre and fruit - scented showers , are hugely popular			0
i love the wood - panelled @entity107 , with its sumptuous armchairs and tinkling piano music			0
put through her paces : @entity11 's gourmet tuition continues as @entity32 sails the @entity62 passengers can sample gins from 20 @entity59 counties			1
when sugar cravings strike , i head for the quirky afternoon teas in @entity118			0
dinners there are just as much fun - my palette cleanser is a lipstick - shaped sorbet which the elderly passenger next to me mistakes for actual make - up			0
the entertainment is as varied as the cuisine : i cringe at the jokes by mononymous comedian @entity130 , whose opener mocks his ' half - @entity133 ' neighbour , but love @entity135 's talk about life as the @entity9 's press secretary			0
the final stop is the @entity73 port of @entity140 , where boats spouting water fountains accompany our arrival			0
that evening , i join my fellow passengers for a glass of something fizzy			0
the tune ? @entity150 , naturally			0
a seven - night cruise to @entity153 's fjords on @entity32 , sailing round - trip from @entity155 , costs from £ 699pp , departing on may 16 , 2015 ( 0843 374 0111 ; www.pocruises.com ) .			2
