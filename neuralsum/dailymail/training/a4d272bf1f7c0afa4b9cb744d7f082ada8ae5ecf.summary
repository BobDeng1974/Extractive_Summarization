by @entity0 a virtual robot that can pose as a 14 - year - old schoolgirl to lure and trap paedophiles on social networks has been created by @entity6 engineers			1
the sophisticated computer program , also known as a ' chatbot ' , is called @entity9 and capable of having conversations with potential sexual predators online and fooling them into believing it is a real person			1
and now a police force in @entity6 is looking at ways in which it could employ the undercover robot			0
a virtual robot called @entity18 has been created by @entity6 engineers to protect teenagers from potential sexual predators when online			1
the software , known as a ' chatbot ' , is capable of having conversations with paedophiles and tricking them into thinking its a real person at a computer conference in @entity29 , a software called @entity27 succeeded in fooling 59.3 per cent of 1,334 voters that it was a human being			1
@entity27 was tested alongside humans , for ' control ' purposes			0
the audience watched as 30 volunteers conducted a four - minute typed conversation with an online chatter who could either be a @entity27 , or a real person behind a screen			2
the conversations were displayed on a big screen for the audience to vote on			2
placed in a forum where a paedophile is thought to be lurking , @entity9 starts off as a passive and neutral participant in general online conversations			1
as conversations become more intimate or suggestive , and the ' target ' begins to employ grooming tactics , @entity18 's behaviour changes in ways designed to lure him in			0
the chatbot can appear insistent or offended , and an attempt to obtain personal information will cause @entity9 to try to find out more about the suspect			1
scientists used game theory , a mathematical system of strategic decision making , to make its behaviour more convincing			0
@entity9 has been programmed to have a split personality , with seven different conversation patterns , to make it more convincing			1
other tricks include inserting ' typos ' , abbreviations , and deliberate language errors to mimic the actions of a young teenager			0
one of @entity18 's creators , dr @entity75 , from the @entity76 , said : ' @entity77 tend to be very predictable			0
' their behaviour and interest in a conversation are flat , which is a problem when attempting to detect untrustworthy targets like paedophiles			0
' what is new about @entity9 is that it employs game theory to maintain a much more realistic conversation			2
' this flow diagram demonstrates how the @entity9 goes about having a conversation with potential predators on social network sites			1
it has been programmed with seven different personality types and can add typos to conversations as well as feign offense to appear more life - like in tests , not only could the program resume discussions separated in time , but it was able to ' take the lead ' in conversations and use slang expressions			1
the team had a collaborative agreement with the @entity105 , the @entity107 police force , which has shown ' considerable interest ' , said dr @entity75			0
' @entity9 has already been implemented and trialled actively on @entity111 's chat service and could also be translated into other languages , ' he added			2
' we do not discard the possibility of bringing it to new channels in the future and we believe it could be a very useful tool for social networks to incorporate			0
' despite having a high degree of artificial intelligence , @entity18 's powers of conversation are still limited , the researchers point out and it is unable to detect linguistic subtleties such as irony , for example .			0

the sophisticated computer program is called @entity9 and poses as 14 - year - old
it is capable of having life - like conversations with potential predators
