the world ’s most wanted female terrorist has fled to @entity3 , it was revealed last night – as police admitted they stopped surveillance on her deadly @entity7 cell six months ago because they were deemed ‘ low - risk ’			1
@entity9 , the widow of one of the gunmen who massacred 17 civilians in the @entity14 capital – is now thought to be with her murderous @entity16 allies after fleeing the country			2
official sources in @entity19 said that 24 - hour scrutiny of members of her terror cell had been dropped to focus on other targets			0
last night , @entity9 , 26 , was branded ‘ armed and dangerous ’ by @entity26 ’s top policeman @entity25 , who said she was believed to have helped plan the attacks			1
the crossbow terror girl on the run : @entity9 , wife of the jihadi in @entity19 deli siege , posing with a lethal weapon in @entity34 , central @entity26 , in 2010 @entity9 , right , walked away from a low - paid job as a cashier in 2009 and started wearing a veil			1
she ‘ devoted herself ’ to @entity39 , left as long as five years ago she was pictured in full @entity41 dress and using a lethal crossbow in the @entity14 countryside where she met jihadi recruiters			2
she and the three @entity19 killers were all known to the security services			0
yet despite their fanatical hatred of the @entity49 and access to weapons , police decided to stop tracking them in july 2014			0
it has emerged that hundreds of phone calls between @entity9 and @entity54 , wife of @entity55 , have shown up on mobile records			1
five hundred in all were made last year			0
@entity9 was reported to have flown from @entity57 to @entity58 on january 2 , crossing the @entity60 border into @entity3 on thursday			1
this was the day after brothers said and @entity55 , murdered 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine @entity65			1
it was also the day her husband , @entity39 , murdered a female police officer before shooting four hostages at a kosher delicatessen in @entity19			1
the suggestion is that @entity9 knew the attacks were due to take place and fled			2
@entity14 police named the hostage taker as @entity39 , left , 32 , but @entity9 , right , 26 , is not thought to have been at his side at the time her husband and the @entity55 brothers were all gunned down by police commandos at the end of two sieges on friday			1
last night , as @entity26 remained on high alert , extraordinary stories of courage emerged from those caught up in the deadly attacks : - a heroic customer at the kosher deli grabbed one of @entity39 ’s guns – but paid with his life after the weapon jammed - a @entity94 worker at the shop helped @entity97 customers hide from the terrorist , in what was hailed as an inspiring act of bravery - a father told how he and his three - year - old son had tried to hide from @entity39 in the store basement , but was forced to follow the gunman ’s orders until police launched their raid , killing the terrorist in a hail of bullets as he ran out of the shop ’s doors - a hostage revealed how he bandaged a neck wound suffered by @entity65 murderer @entity116 , after the brothers took shelter at his printing works special forces stormed the @entity97 grocery to the east of @entity19 where terrorist @entity123 had taken at least seven people hostage hostages - who had been held for hours with @entity39 threatening to kill them - flee from the shop meanwhile , the family of a @entity94 police officer shot dead by the brothers described them as ‘ madmen ’ with no religion			1
up to a million people , including @entity133 and other world leaders , are expected to join a march for peace and unity in @entity19 today			0
counter-terrorism ministers including home secretary @entity139 will also meet to discuss the @entity49 ’s response to the growing threat of @entity143 violence			0
in @entity147 , landmarks including @entity145 and @entity146 will display the colours of the @entity14 flag to show solidarity			0
security patrols were also being stepped up across @entity147 amid increased fears of attacks on @entity97 communities			0
and @entity155 is asking travellers returning to @entity157 from @entity26 if they saw ‘ any suspicious activity ’ while away			0
@entity9 and her co-conspirators were put under phone , internet and physical surveillance at the end of 2011 , when @entity116 returned from @entity164 , where he trained with @entity165			1
there he met @entity168 , a terrorist mastermind later killed in a @entity170 drone strike			0
‘ but between that date and the summer of 2014 , nothing suggested any connection with a radical @entity143 movement , ’ said a @entity19 judicial source			0
‘ so the surveillance was stopped in order to refocus on other individuals who at that moment presented a higher risk			0
’ the body of a man can be seen at the entrance of the @entity97 supermarket after it was stormed by commandos from bikini beach girl ... to jihadi with her crossbow wearing a skimpy bikini as she embraces her muscular boyfriend , she looks like any other attractive young beachgoer on the @entity191			2
but the once - glamorous @entity9 , 26 , is now the most wanted female terrorist suspect in the world			1
she is reported to have fled to @entity3 before her 32 - year - old husband @entity39 – the smiling young man in the picture – murdered four @entity97 in a @entity19 deli			1
there were suggestions yesterday that @entity9 had helped her husband , along with fellow terrorists @entity116 and @entity55 , compile an arsenal of weapons which @entity19 prosecutors said included two @entity205 - made @entity204 machine pistols , commercial explosives and hunting knives			1
together : @entity9 on holiday with @entity39 it is thought that the firearms were smuggled from the @entity211 into @entity212 , and then into @entity26 by car – something a single woman is likely to have been able to get away with far easier than men			1
as detectives try to learn more about the group responsible for @entity26 ’s worst terrorist outrage this century , they know that piecing together @entity9 ’s transformation from a relaxed young woman into a terrorist training with a crossbow will be essential			2
the former supermarket cashier is said to have been radicalised by the man she would go on to marry in an @entity41 , rather than civil , ceremony			0
like her husband , @entity9 was born into a large family of seven children , but when she was just six her mother died			2

estranged from her father , @entity9 ended up in care , relying on social workers to bring her up			2
she was in her early 20s when she met @entity39 in @entity240 , the rundown @entity19 suburb where he was brought up			2
questioned by police at his home in @entity244 , another @entity19 suburb , @entity9 ’s father yesterday said he was ‘ shocked and horrified ’ to learn his daughter was involved with a terrorist cell			1
taking aim : @entity9 and @entity39 on another break in @entity249 in 2010 but this time to meet his terror mentor @entity250 in rural @entity26 , where they both learned how to use a crossbow she told police who interviewed her in 2010 as part of their inquiries into @entity39 ’s dealings with @entity41 extremists that she had walked away from a low - paid job as a cashier in 2009 and began wearing an @entity41 veil , the kind that is now illegal in @entity26			1
@entity9 said that she was inspired by her husband and the radicals she lived with to ‘ read a lot of books on religion , and because of this i came to ask questions on religion ’			0
she added : ‘ when i saw the massacre of the innocents in @entity273 , in @entity274 , in @entity275 , in @entity276 or anywhere the @entity170 sent their bombers , all that … well , who are the terrorists ? ’ she said that when @entity170 killed innocents , it was the right of men to defend their women and children – one of the reasons she said she started weapons training			0
along with @entity39 , she was pictured in 2010 visiting a convicted @entity165 terrorist , mentor @entity250 – who was radicalised at the @entity291 mosque in @entity147 – while he was under house arrest in @entity34 , @entity26			0
until recently the couple lived in @entity294 , a suburb of @entity19 where they were known as a devoutly religious when police questioned her and said they knew she and @entity39 had visited @entity298 at the same time as @entity55 and two other convicted terrorists – jihadi recruiter @entity300 and @entity301 of the @entity303 terror group – she replied : ‘ we went there for crossbow practice			1
’ until recently the couple lived in @entity294 , a suburb of @entity19 where they were known as a devoutly religious , despite @entity39 ’s regular run - ins with the law			2
to neighbours , the pair were quiet and respectful			0
but while @entity9 had no criminal record , @entity39 has a long history of both petty and serious crimes			1
the only boy of a family of ten in @entity240 , he first came to police attention as a 17 - year - old			0
convictions for theft and drug offences followed and he was arrested for an attempted armed robbery on a bank in @entity325 in september 2002			0
@entity9 , who was never seen in public without her veil , waited four years for @entity39 to come out of jail after his conviction for armed robbery			1
she met the younger of the @entity55 brothers , @entity55 , at a time when the pair were linked with a jihadist recruitment ring that sent fighters to @entity274			1
@entity55 was convicted in 2008 and sentenced to three years in jail , with 18 months suspended , for his association with the underground organisation			0
he had wanted to fly to @entity274 via @entity3 and was found with a manual for a @entity340 – the automatic weapon used in last week ’s outrages			0
... and her husband 's bloody journey from @entity291 mentor to death at deli willing conspirator : @entity39 , right , with his jihadi mentor @entity250 , an @entity165 follower who was radicalised at @entity291 in @entity147			2
@entity39 and @entity9 visited @entity351 in rural @entity26 in 2010 shadow of death : a figure , thought to be @entity39 , is silhouetted , making a dash for the glass doors of the deli where he held shoppers hostage - straight towards a pistol aimed at him by one of the armed officers waiting outside downed : the terrorist lies dead , in a pool of blood			1
