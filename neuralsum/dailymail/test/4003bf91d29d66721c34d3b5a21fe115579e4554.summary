shopping with friends is bad for your bank balance â€“ because it encourages people to spend far more than they would if making purchases by themselves			2
in a survey of 1,000 people from across the country , conducted by personal budgeting software company @entity9 , 64 per cent of adults confessed that they end up spending more money when they shop with friends			1
the main reasons for this were said to be ' showing off in front of friends ' and ' succumbing to peer pressure and buying things we would n't ordinary buy '			2
peer pressure : 64 per cent of adults think they spend more money when they go shopping with friends , many blaming the urge to ' show off ' nearly half of the participants ( 45 per cent ) blamed the fact that they get carried away by excitement when they shop with friends			1
in fact , nearly two - thirds of @entity33 admit they would actually prefer to shop by themselves than with pals			0
but the site that conducted the study says there 's no need to hit the mall alone to avoid buyer 's remorse			0
' it 's all about priorities , ' said @entity45 , a spokesperson for @entity46			0
' you need to decide what is most important to you and set your budget accordingly			0
' when you know you will get to spend money on the things that matter most , it is easier to say no to impulse purchases and feel good about what you do buy , because it fits your long - term goals			2
' food : 58 per cent clothing : 54 per cent household items : 28 per cent shoes : 21 per cent entertainment : 20 per cent but while 85 per cent of participants in the study said they do give themselves a budget when they shop , 95 per cent admitted that they usually spend more than originally planned			1
top items on which people overspend on include food ( 58 per cent ) , clothing ( 54 per cent ) , household items ( 28 per cent ) , shoes ( 21 per cent ) , and entertainment ( 20 per cent )			1
meanwhile , 53 per cent justify their overspending because an item happened to be on sale , while 34 per cent call their pricey purchases a ' special treat '			0
an impulsive 22 per cent said they just had to do it because it was ' absolutely necessary ' at the time			0
a further 19 per cent of respondents also said their spouse or partner gives them a hard time for overspending , though five per cent do n't even tell their significant others about their big purchases .			1

a new @entity9 study found that 64 per cent of adults spend more money with friends *due* to peer pressure or the *desire* to show off
the top items @entity33 overspend on are food and clothing
five per cent of those *polled* said they hide big purchases from their spouses or significant others
