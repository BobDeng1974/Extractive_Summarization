silly stunt : @entity1 and the rubber chicken			2
her @entity3 of public appearances and lucrative business commitments that could make her more than £ 150,000 in a year @entity7 may have cruised through the opening rounds of @entity9 as reigning champion — but it ’s his mum @entity1 who has taken on a @entity3 of public appearances and lucrative business commitments that could make her more than £ 150,000 in a year			1
her week started with an unlikely appearance on @entity15 ’s @entity14			0
then we witnessed her ‘ ambassadorship ’ for @entity21 coffee — as part of a deal thought to be worth around £ 25,000 , 54 - year - old @entity1 was seen helping to dispense free coffee to @entity9 fans , and manning a coffee stall with former @entity9 champ @entity25 and @entity27 ’s uncle - coach @entity26			1
a bigger commitment is her deal with @entity30 , the drinks brand that has had a partnership with @entity9 for more than 100 years			1
among other advertising ventures and coaching initiatives , she has filmed a series of comic skits with former @entity38 no 1 @entity37 , debating whether part of @entity9 should be called ‘ @entity40 ’ or ‘ @entity40 ’			0
the @entity30 deal , worth around £ 50,000 and brokered by the leading sports agency @entity41 , led her this week to take part in a stunt in which she was photographed bouncing a rubber chicken on a tennis racquet			1
in past years tennis fans struggled to take @entity1 to their hearts — all that fist - pumping and clenched aggression made her appear too pushy			1
but after @entity7 ’s victory last year , and aided by a makeover that turned her into a glamorous white - blonde , @entity1 is being seen in a new light			1
at least , that is the plan			0
in a long junior and senior tennis career she won 64 @entity57 titles but her victories were never translated into international success			2
instead she launched herself into coaching , and her dream now is to launch a tennis academy in @entity57 , preferably near the @entity63 ’ home town of @entity65			2
‘ this is my big goal			0
i want it to be something to leave behind , ’ she has said			0
but she needs more than £ 15 million in initial funding , and there will be heavy maintenance costs thereafter — hence the deals with @entity73 and @entity30 , and another as a ‘ brand ambassador ’ for @entity75 , the racquet maker			1
it was @entity1 , rather than @entity7 , who gave a cover interview to the @entity78 , in which she spoke about the @entity65 shooting massacre at @entity7 ’s primary school			1
she has also started an online column for @entity82 — and now there are unconfirmed reports that she will be a contestant on the next series of @entity86			0
a fan of the @entity89 show , she would be paid £ 25,000 to take part , rising to £ 60,000 if she makes the quarter - finals and up to £ 75,000 for the semis			2
add in newspaper interviews and shameless flirting with the young comedian @entity95 on his @entity97 show , and you have what appears to be a concerted media blitz			0
indeed , a glance at @entity102 ( @ @entity103 ) reveals a media - savvy woman enjoying her moment in the sun. this week she has plugged her sponsored activities , sent out daily words of encouragement to @entity7 and his new coach @entity111 , and kept followers up to date with her hectic social schedule			1
if she is heartbroken by her split from long - term partner @entity115 , she is hiding it well			0
they were together for about five years but are thought to have parted in january			0
while @entity1 travels the world supporting @entity7 and his brother @entity120 at tennis tournaments , @entity7 ’s girlfriend @entity118 stays largely at home			1
coaching is still @entity1 ’s chief passion — and turning that @entity126 into a reality			0
and if that means having to bounce a rubber chicken on a purple novelty tennis racquet for her sponsors , then so be it .			2

@entity135 **'s** business deals could make her more than £ 150,000 a year
her deal with @entity30 , the drinks brand , is worth around £ 50,000
tennis fans have in the past struggled to warm to @entity7 **'s** mother
