by @entity0 published : 10:27 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 10:27 est , 7 june 2013 it 's school , but not as most schoolchildren know it			2
these @entity4 children are trainees at the @entity5 , and dream of performing around the world			2
with lessons from morning til night , and only an hour and a half off a day , their rigorous training will ensure that those who achieve their dream will be the best they can be			0
the children training for the @entity5 in @entity4 's @entity12 spends hours each day practising contortion only the best and most dedicated children will make it through to become members of the independent troupe training for the troupe is free for talented children , and those who make it will receive a contract to perform and a monthly wage			1
the acrobats , based in @entity24 , in southern @entity4 's @entity12 , are run by 76 - year - old troupe leader @entity25 , a former acrobat who performed for chairman @entity28			1
he runs a tight ship			0
earlier this year , the leader dismissed two children because he decided they were n't training as hard as the others			0
' they could set bad examples , ' he said			0
the troupe 's young members , who live together in a dormitory , train each day from 8.10am to 11.30am , and from 2pm - 5.30pm			1
their schedule is pinned on a board in front of the training house and includes body contortion , handstand , skate rolling , kung fu , stairs , and many others			0
the children at the acrobatic school practise the same stunts over and over again until they are perfected with every tendon tightly controlled , and jaws clenched with effort , two female students practise holding a handstand as part of their training the children perform the same actions over and over again until they are perfected			2
each month the difficulty level is then raised and they learn a new set of even tougher stunts			0
one such stunt is called the @entity64 , and involves the acrobat placing her chin on the floor and curling her body up behind her with her feet placed on the floor in front of her face			0
mr @entity25 said : ' most kids started training from eight years old , and as an acrobat they only have five years of golden time , from 16 to 20			1
with their neck and their jaw taking all of their body weight , it is obvious why such rigorous training is necessary the troupe was set up by former acrobat @entity25 , 76 , who once performed in front of chairman @entity28 the trainee acrobats live together in dormitories and dream of winning a paid contract with the respected troupe utmost dedication is required of the pupils - earlier this year two children were dismissed for not training hard enough each month the difficulty level is raised and the young students start to learn a new set of even tougher stunts ' after 20 years old , their skills are becoming rusty and body is becoming stiff '			1
mr @entity25 performed on stage for more than 40 years , and after retiring from a provincial state - owned acrobatics troupe , he established his own			2
he said : ' no one can perform my programme anymore , as it takes years of extremely hard training			0
' the respected troupe leader now has connections around the world and has taken his troupe to perform in countries including @entity110 , the @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			1
@entity4 's long - established @entity5 is well respected and performs all over the world learning to be an acrobat requires complete dedication , and the students train from 8.10am until 5.30pm the patched shoes reflect the fact that money is tight for the students , but they will earn a monthly wage living and training at such close quarters , the students develop tight friendships with each other this young girl is practising for a stunt called the @entity64 - agility is essential for these highly skilled acrobats			1

youngsters train in the hope of joining @entity4 's @entity5
they work from *8am* - 5.30pm perfecting stunts at their school in @entity24
troupe leader @entity25 , 76 , says their ' golden years ' are from 16 to 20
those who make it will earn a monthly wage and perform around the world
