the @entity0 pressured its allies to provide pro bono legal aid to unaccompanied minors today			1
with @entity8 out of session and legislation to provide emergency funding to immigration agencies stalled , the @entity0 is leaning on immigration advocates to help provide legal services to immigrant children going through deportation proceedings			1
the @entity0 hosted approximately 60 law firms and nonprofits today to discuss ways groups can help reduce the burden on the government and make sure unaccompanied minors receive legal counsel			1
the situation at the border is ' the single most significant , heart - wrenching and divisive thing that ’s happening in terms of the immigration debate right now , ' vice president @entity20 told attendees			1
the @entity0 hosted approximately 60 law firms and nonprofits today to discuss ways groups can help the government provide unaccompanied minors with legal counsel			1
' we need trained lawyers ' to help determine which kids should receive refugee status , vice president @entity20 told them according to the @entity0 , fewer than half of illegal immigrant children have proper legal representative , putting them at a disadvantage when they appear before immigration courts			1
already the @entity0 has deployed a government program to train lawyers and paralegals to represent children facing deported , but immigration groups say the program will affect a small portion of minors scheduled to appear in court			1
since last october a surge of more than 57,000 unaccompanied minors have illegally entered the @entity52 and the federal government expects as many as 90,000 to arrive at the border by the end of the year			2
children who identify themselves as @entity57 can be immediately sent back to their home country , but those coming from non-contiguous countries to the @entity52 must be afforded due process before they can be repatriated			0
courts now face a backlog of more than 375,000 immigration , including those of unaccompanied minors , and illegal immigrants wait up to three years for a hearing			1
the governments of @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 have asked the @entity52 to make a special exception in refugee laws for children coming from their countries due to the prevalence of @entity78 @entity0 has resisted those efforts , however			0
' if the measure we ’re going to use as to whether or not asylum is granted is if you ’re better off in @entity52 than you are someplace else , well there ’s at least 800 million kids who are eligible , ' @entity20 told immigration advocates today			1
' that ’s where you all come in , ' he told attendees			2
' we need lawyers , we need trained lawyers , to determine whether or not these [ illegal immigrant ] kids meet the criteria for refugee status			0
' @entity20 said he understood it 's ' going to be really hard ' to pick and choose which children deserve to stay , but it must be done			2
' i wish i had a more perfect solution , ' he told them , noting that even comprehensive immigration reform would n't solve this problem			0
this june 25 photo shows a group of immigrants from @entity72 and @entity71 who crossed the @entity52 - @entity108 border illegally as they are stopped in @entity109 , @entity110			0
the @entity52 has seen a surge of @entity112 illegally entering the country throughout the last year the @entity115 administration has promised to speed up deportation hearings and administration officials have expressed interest in changing the law to allow @entity112 children - who make up the bulk of new arrivals - to voluntarily return home , as most will not qualify for refugee status under current law			1
but immigration advocates and many @entity127 have come out in staunch opposition to the initiatives because they reduce immigrant children 's access to the court system			0
in july the @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , and @entity137 filed a class - action lawsuit against the government for not providing illegal children with legal representation			1
' if we believe in due process for children in our country , then we can not abandon them when they face deportation in our immigration courts , ' @entity142 , a senior staff attorney with the @entity133 's @entity143 , said in a statement announcing the lawsuit			0
' the government pays for a trained prosecutor to advocate for the deportation of every child			0
it is patently unfair to force children to defend themselves alone			0
' in an emergency funding request to @entity8 in july the @entity0 requested $ 15 million for legal representation for children in immigration proceedings			1
democrats in the @entity163 revised the @entity0 's request upward to $ 50 million , but that bill died in the @entity163 just before it left for august recess			0
a @entity168 bill approving additional border spending cut funding for lawyers for immigrant children out in its entirety			0
that bill passed the @entity0 late last friday and awaits action in the @entity163 when members return next month			0
president @entity115 has said he would veto that bill because it did not adequately fulfill immigration agencies needs			2
just as the flare up on the border the @entity0 announced $ 2 million in grants for a federally funded public defender program for illegal immigrant children that will be managed by the @entity184 and the @entity185 , the agency that oversees @entity186			1
the program will provide for 100 lawyers and paralegals for children under the age of 16 who are have already received a notice to appear before the court			2
a spokesperson for the @entity185 told the @entity197 in june that ' the program has been in the works for a really long time ' and while consistent with the administration 's goal to provide representation to newly arriving illegal immigrant children , it was part of its response to the border crisis			1
' a hundred lawyers nationwide is not going to satisfy our commitment to protecting these children , ' @entity208 , executive director of the @entity209 , told the @entity197 after the administration announced the program			2
' if we have to give lawyers to murderers , then perhaps we should give them to refugee orphans			0
' likewise , @entity219 , a senior staff attorney with non-profit law firm @entity220 , one of the group 's suing the @entity184 , said there 's not enough lawyers who are willing to represent illegal children to for free , however			1
' each day , we are contacted by children in desperate need of lawyers to advocate for them in their deportation proceedings , ' @entity226 said in a statement supporting the class action suit			0
' pro bono efforts have been valiant , but they will never fully meet the increasing and complex needs these children present			0
' only with additional financial aid from the government will illegal immigrant children receive the legal help they need , she argued			2
' the time has come for our government to recognize our @entity245 ’s promise of fairness and its duty to give these children a real voice in court			0

the @entity0 hosted 60 law firms and nonprofits today in an effort to get more immigration groups to provide free legal aid to illegal children
the @entity115 administration tried to get @entity8 to provide more money for legal services for unaccompanied minors but that legislation is stalled
a recently announced government funded program will only provide lawyers for a small portion of the children awaiting trial
vice president @entity20 told attendees of today 's meeting the government needs their help determining which kids qualify for asylum
