by @entity0 sir @entity1 has waded into the row over term - time holidays in a blog post entitled ‘ let children travel the world ’			1
in the post , the @entity8 boss says he ‘ wholeheartedly ’ supports parent @entity10 who is campaigning for a judicial review of recent legislation that tightened the rules on term - time trips			1
mrs @entity10 , 39 , and her husband were prosecuted for taking their two children out of school to travel to @entity19 for three weeks in october last year			1
' grab it with both hands ' : sir @entity1 said travel was important for children and argued that parents should not be punished for taking a holiday during term - time if that was the only time they could afford it sir @entity1 wrote : ‘ it is really important that kids spend as much time travelling and learning as possible , from a young age			1
‘ travel is not always an option for everyone ; for those who are fortunate enough to be able to travel , they should grab it with both hands			0
‘ if there is no other time when parents can afford - financially or time-wise - to take a holiday , they should not be punished for doing so during term			2
’ referring to the fact that mrs @entity10 had been ordered to pay £ 400 legal costs for removing her children from school without permission , he wrote : ‘ her circumstances - at the time she was caring for her mother who was terminally ill – were not taken into account			1
' she argued that taking her children on holiday with her husband was necessary to give everyone a break and protect the mental health of her kids			0
‘ while it is obviously important that all children should have access to regular education , there is no reason why they can not catch up when they return , and do extra work out of class			0
’ mr @entity1 , who left school aged 16 , said that increasing the flexibility for young people ’s learning could only be a good thing and said he echoed mrs @entity10 ’s call for the government to give parents more support and greater flexibility			1
he wrote : ‘ letting children travel provides the opportunity for families to spend quality time with each other , something i have always found invaluable with my own family			2
some of my happiest memories are of childhood holidays – some during term - time , some not			2
’ family holiday : @entity10 and her husband @entity90 took their two children to visit relatives in @entity19 in her petition , mrs @entity10 is demanding a judicial review of the new regulations , and asks mps ‘ to recommend that greater support and flexibility [ are ] allowed for parents to enable them to more effectively care for their children ’			1
she claimed that her family ’s three - week trip had to be during term time as she is a full - time carer for her dying mother - in - law and that was the only time alternative care could be arranged			1
she was prosecuted by @entity108 for taking her children out of school and ordered to pay a £ 240 fine , which she refused on principle			1
the court imposed a 12 - month conditional discharge and ordered mrs @entity10 to pay £ 400 costs			1
when mrs @entity10 was invited on a daytime tv show to discuss the case , the council obtained an injunction preventing identification of the children - in effect silencing her			2
now mrs @entity10 has defied the gag and can be named under parliamentary privilege after @entity124 mp @entity124 provided details of the case in a petition laid before the @entity128			0
mrs @entity10 , a former emergency call handler , said : ‘ i am very angry because now i have a criminal record			0
‘ my family circumstances mean that i had no choice but to take the children away when i did – and there are many parents in the same position who can not take their children away in a period specified by school			2
‘ any mother in my situation would do the same			0
i have not had one negative comment from the mums at the school gates			0
‘ the law states that there have to be exceptional circumstances			0
well , if it is not caring for a terminally ill person with two primary school children , then what is ? ’ @entity19 trip : mrs @entity10 says the three - week trip had to be during term time as she is a full - time carer for her dying mother - in - law and that was the only time alternative care could be arranged @entity108 council said it followed @entity159 guidance			1
it claimed : ‘ on this occasion the parents decided not to accept the penalty notice , but the court ’s verdict demonstrates that the council ’s course of action was correct			0
’ in september , new legislation came into force ending a policy that allowed schools to grant up to 10 days leave for family holidays and introducing bigger fines for parents who take their children out of school			0
under the new rules , parents face fines of up to £ 120 for taking children out of school during term time without good reason			1
failing to pay risks a fine of up to £ 1,500 - or even jail - and pupils can only miss lessons in ' exceptional circumstances ' , such as a family funeral			2
the government recently published a @entity189 that would allow schools to set their own term dates			0
the intention is to stagger holidays and drive down high summer prices that prompt some parents to take their children out of school .			0
