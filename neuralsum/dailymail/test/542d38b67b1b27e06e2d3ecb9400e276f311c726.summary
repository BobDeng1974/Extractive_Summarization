@entity0 says he feared there would have been crowd trouble if he 'd agreed to have his @entity5 team form a guard of honour for @entity8 in the @entity10 derby			1
@entity8 head coach @entity11 and @entity8 defender @entity12 have both rounded on their city rivals for refusing a public display of acknowledgement for the @entity18 title winners at @entity19			1
@entity20 lined up to applaud @entity8 on to the @entity22 pitch when the teams played just over a week ago , and @entity24 and @entity25 did the same			1
but @entity0 , who admitted that the police had n't been consulted , insisted that the threat of unrest – not a lack of respect – was responsible for the decision			1
@entity5 boss @entity0 feared unrest among fans if his side formed a guard of honour for city rivals @entity8 ' it 's been turned into a lack of respect , ' said the @entity5 boss			1
' well , i rang @entity11 the day after they won the league and congratulated them and said they had been the best team over the season and that it had been fully deserved			0
' my players have come out in the press and said @entity8 have been the best team			1
i think that 's respect			2
' the reason why we decided against it is because there are two sets of rivals fans , it 's a derby , there 's going to be a lot of animosity			1
you are going to have one set of fans that will be jovial because they 've won the league , you 'll have one that are not going to be happy about that			2
' the most important thing is the safety of the fans and that 's the main reason we 've done it			0
we do n't want to start the game on a bad foot , that 's the reason we 've done it			0
not a lack of respect			1
it 's a respect for fans			1
it 's a decision we spoke about and we feel as if it 's the right decision for both sets of fans			1
' we ca n't let this get out of control for the reasons we 've done it			0
we 've seen silly things happen over the years and we do n't want to get into that state because of a guard of honour			2
' if i won the league and we were at @entity94 , i would n't expect a guard of honour there			2
we do n't turn around and say because one team has done it every other team has to			0
i would n't expect it			0
' because you know it only takes on person			0
before you know it , you 've got a situation on your hands that could have been prevented			0
we want the derby to be spoken about for the right reasons , not the wrong reasons – and it only takes one idiot			0
' agreeing that it would be unthinkable for either @entity115 team to offer their oldest rivals a guard of honour in a similar situation , @entity0 said : ' so why 's it any different here ? ' it 's a derby and it means a lot to both sets of fans			1
' @entity8 head coach @entity11 feels that it is disrespectful not to acknowledge his team 's achievements @entity8 fans favourite @entity12 inferred that the decision not to have a guard of honour showed a lack of respect by @entity5 , while boss @entity11 claimed it could backfire on them on the pitch			1
' it is up to them if they want to do it , ' said @entity12			0
' but other teams have shown respect to us - and if @entity5 do n't want to do it , that says a lot about them			1
' teams like @entity20 showed us a little bit of respect for a fantastic season and it 's a good feeling because you have worked really hard all season to win the league like this			0
' that kind of respect you get is really nice but they [ @entity5 ] are not going to do it , so that is it			1
is that going to motivate me ? yes			0
i have a lot of respect for the other teams			0
this gives us extra motivation to show them why we ' re champions			0
if you 're asking me , i would have no problem with doing that for @entity5			2
' @entity11 added : ' that 's @entity5 ' prerogative			2
i think it will actually take some of the focus off our players , instead of coming out to a guard of honour and not concentrating on the game			2
' it can also give the opposition team a bit of spirit and a bit of fight to say : ' we 've given you a guard of honour , now we are going to turn you over ! ' that can happen			2
' i 've been in that situation where you are standing there clapping , and your first thought is to go out there and show them			0
hopefully it will work in our favour that they do n't do it on sunday			0
' @entity8 fans favourite @entity12 ( right ) shares his boss ' view that @entity5 should pay tribute to them			1

@entity5 will not form a guard of honour for @entity18 winners @entity8 during the @entity10 derby
boss @entity0 believes it would cause unrest among the fans
@entity8 head coach and defender @entity213 feel that @entity0 ' decision shows a lack of respect
