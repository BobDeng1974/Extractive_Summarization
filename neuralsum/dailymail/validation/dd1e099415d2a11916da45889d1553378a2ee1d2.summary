a talented designer has come up with a real ' floating palace ' that is sure to catch the eye of superyacht owners			1
@entity7 's @entity6 concept is very much a luxury item			1
but it is no celebrity - style motoryacht ; it is a 180ft yacht , complete with two masts and huge sails			1
the living quarters resemble a glass box , offering stunning views 24/7 and the glass area can be folded away so as to open up the yacht and take in the sea air			1
there are also steps that can be folded down into the sea giving you your very own swimming pool			0
there is one master cabin , two vip cabins and two twin - bed residences			0
the yacht is a progression from @entity7 's @entity45 structure which was inspired by skyscrapers and @entity47 and resembles a gleaming block rising from the sea			2
instead , this sailing yacht is a somewhat more dreamy offering			0
' the world is a laboratory of ideas that can be borrowed , ' @entity52 writes on his website			1
' certain typologies can evolve because they have adoptive features			0
@entity6 could be thought of as an evolution of these preconceived ideas			2
' a walk down to the lower deck offers a stunning balcony view that can also act as a sun trap the yacht is a progression from @entity52 's glass structure which was inspired by skyscrapers and @entity47 for any crew employed there are also four twin - bed cabins in a separate part of the yacht			1
on his website @entity52 describes how he believes ' great design offers an authentic beauty that invites people to consider experiencing the world in a different way ; perhaps a way they never imagined			2
' @entity52 was last year nominated for @entity81 by @entity82 and is a @entity83 at @entity84 in the @entity85			1
although the ideas are only at the ' design ' stage , it is hoped the innovative and futuristic superyacht may well be just what one millionaire is after			0
the upper deck offers relaxing space , and despite the choppy seas there are plenty of facilities to keep you relaxed on board @entity101 , principal consultant at @entity102 – the worldwide authority on superyacht purchase and construction – gave @entity106 his views on the @entity6 concept			1
' i really like many of @entity6 's features			2
sure , it 's been created by a young designer – and this shows – but with a little further investment it could be turned into a glorious , ground - breaking vessel			0
' the great thing about superyachts is that no planning permission is needed to build one – there are just some common sense safety regulations to be met			0
so buyers can make a floating space that 's truly a reflection of their personalities and aspirations			0
the superyacht is very much a futuristic design , the brainchild of talented yacht lover @entity52 ' i love the water - yacht interfaces			1
for years , too many designers viewed superyachts as floating houses			0
it took a long time for the ‘ beach club ’ concept to be accepted ( this is where hinged parts of the hull fold outwards to create platforms down by the water ’s edge ) – now they ’re de rigueur for engine - driven superyachts			0
' @entity6 ’s beach club at the back is an idea that ’s not been tried as yet , but it ’d be great as it offers a shady area that ’s also surrounded by water on three sides			2
' the steps on the side are wonderful , but some thought would be needed as how and where they would be stored when not in use as weight on a sailing superyacht must always be carried as centrally and low as possible to counteract the action of the wind on those sails			1

@entity6 is the latest superyacht concept by @entity85 based designer @entity52
living quarter in the form of a centrally located glass box that can become open air
in keeping with *environmental* *objectives* , yacht has sails instead of a motor
