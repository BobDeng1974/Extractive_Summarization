former @entity1 managing director @entity0 , held in a @entity3 prison without charge for more than nine months , is making progress in his fight against his former colleagues at @entity3 - based @entity9 investment bank @entity8 , who are still 25 per cent shareholders at pantomime club @entity1			1
@entity12 and @entity13 , a @entity1 director , are the subject of an application to be heard at @entity16 ’ @entity17 on april 9 that the pair be made the subject of arrest warrants and extradition proceedings on the criminal charge of fraudulently luring @entity0 to @entity3 on the pretext of the offer of a new @entity26 - based job			1
leading human rights lawyer , @entity27 , is heading the case against @entity29 and @entity13			0
@entity0 , former managing director of @entity1 , has been held in a @entity3 prison for more than nine months the @entity31 have appointed @entity32 as their new chief executive — and the food industry boss is taking a cut of more than half his salary by moving to @entity37			1
@entity32 , chief executive of @entity38 , was earning £ 1.4million according to the latest accounts , but will receive no more than around £ 650,000 at the @entity31			1
however , the lure of working at the top of @entity43 football was the main incentive for 54 - year - old @entity32 , who has made plenty of money in top jobs with @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity38 — whom he sold to @entity52 food group @entity51 as part of a quick turnaround operation since april 2013			1
@entity32 , known as the ‘ @entity55 ’ of frozen foods after he killed off @entity57 and introduced @entity58 into fish fingers , will have some notable football allies when he starts at the @entity31 on may 18			1
@entity61 season - ticket - holder @entity32 , a level one football coach , has been a friend of @entity66 since he signed him for the @entity68 ads that have been running since 1994			2
and @entity32 was on the board at @entity70 at the same time as @entity71 , chairman of the @entity72			1
such was the secrecy around @entity32 ’s appointment that the selection panel only informed the rest of the @entity31 board about their choice late on thursday night , before the announcement at 10am yesterday			1
and for once , it looks like the @entity31 have selected wisely with @entity32 described by pal @entity81 as an ‘ inspired choice , a genuine football fan , terrific leader , great bloke			2
however , the @entity31 could have appointed @entity32 10 years ago when he was understood to be interested in the job			2
instead , it went to tv sports chief @entity89			0
food industry boss @entity32 ( left , with @entity66 in 2000 ) has been named the @entity31 's new chief @entity92 and the @entity72 , who have a contract for a 9pm saturday highlights show next season , have yet to find a production company to provide the footage			1
and then comes the task of pulling together a programme featuring all three divisions in such a short space of time			0
the rival offers from the @entity105 and @entity106 only promised @entity108 highlights			0
the @entity109 say putting fibre optic connections in all grounds will make life easier			0
the build - up to the @entity114 will last longer than the olympic torch relay before @entity116 the @entity118 roadshow in the @entity119 will start 100 days before the tournament — an even longer build - up than the 70 - day olympic torch relay ahead of @entity116			0
the international leg of the roadshow has demonstrated a big demand to see the trophy because of the craze for sporting selfies — fans wanting a picture of themselves with the @entity114			0
the @entity72 are understood to be looking into the way @entity70 have stayed within @entity132 regulations , despite declaring a loss of nearly £ 21m in the last financial year when they gained promotion			2
it is unclear how the @entity138 kept on the right side of @entity132 limits that allow a maximum loss of £ 8m — not offset by football - related activity — partly through a multi-million - pound marketing and licensing deal with @entity147 - based agency @entity145 , capitalising on their @entity149 owners ’ profile in the @entity151			2
@entity145 is fully owned by former @entity153 chairman sir @entity152 and his son			0
@entity155 was an adviser to the @entity156 after leaving the @entity153 in 2013			0
@entity70 are being investigated into how they were able to stay within @entity132 regulations despite declaring £ 21m losses in the last financial year			0

former @entity1 managing director @entity0 is making progress in his case against @entity3 - based @entity9 investment bank @entity8
the @entity31 appoint food industry boss @entity32 as the new chief executive
@entity92 and the @entity72 are struggling to find a production company to provide footage for their *televised* highlights
