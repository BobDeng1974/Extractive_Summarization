a hedgehog sniffing around in the dusk was once a common sight - but experts warn it may soon become a thing of the past			2
one in five people have never seen a hedgehog in their gardens , according to a wildlife survey			1
and of those who do spot the tiny animals , only a quarter see them frequently , the @entity10 found			1
the startling figures confirm fears that the small @entity16 mammal is suffering a huge decline			1
there are thought to be less than 1 million hedgehogs living in this country today , an estimated 30 per cent drop since 2013			1
one in five people have never seen a hedgehog in their gardens , according to a new wildlife survey part of the reason is the widespread loss of the traditional hedgerows that used to line every country road			1
but the loss of bushes and hedges in back gardens is also thought to have played a role in the animal ’s demise			1
@entity36 , conservation scientist at the @entity10 , said that the popularity of hard wooden or metal fences has made it hard for hedgehogs to move from place to place			2
as they become isolated in smaller and smaller areas of greenery , they can not feed or mate			0
‘ a few decades ago there were tens of millions of hedgehogs in @entity48 , now we think there are maybe 1 million left , ’ mr @entity36 said			1
‘ most of the reason is down to the change in the way we manage our countryside - the loss of hedgerows and woodlands has removed their habitat and the increase in the use of pesticides has removed a lot of the beetles and other animals they feed on			0
‘ but there are concerns about the way we garden as well			0
‘ hedgehogs have to make their way through the maze of back gardens , trying to find gaps in fences			1
‘ it does n’t matter if you have a garden with the most juicy hedgehog food , with lots of slugs and worms - if you fence them out , they are not going to get in			0
’ part of the reason is the widespread loss of the traditional hedgerows that used to line every country road cutting holes of just a few inches - about the size of a cd - is enough for a hedgehog to get through a fence , experts say			2
more than 420,000 people provided information about the wildlife in their back garden as part of the @entity101			1
some 65 per cent said they had seen a hedgehog in the last year - but only 28 per cent saw them once a month or more			0
some 20 per cent of participants had never seen a hedgehog in their garden			0
people were more likely to see a non-native grey squirrel than native hedgehogs , with squirrels spotted in 74 per cent of gardens at least monthly throughout the year			1
red squirrels , which have been lost from large parts of the country , were seen at least monthly in just 2 per cent of gardens			2
conservationists are worried that once - common snakes are also vanishing			0
six out of ten people reported they had never seen a grass snakes and half had never seen a slow worm , another variety of snake			0
@entity125 , @entity10 conservation scientist , said : ‘ despite remaining widespread in many areas of the @entity48 , important habitats for slow worms and grass snakes have been lost			0
‘ as gardens become tidier , reptile homes have been lost , leaving a shortage of habitats in which to live and breed			0
piles of logs , compost heaps and ponds provide ideal warm , sheltered environments for these species to breed , find food and to hibernate			0
’ @entity140 , hedgehog officer for the @entity141 , urged people to take steps in their garden to help hedgehogs find food and shelter			1
he said : ‘ spotting animals is just the start			0
for more people to see hedgehogs in the future , we need more holes in fences , joining up gardens , and more insect - friendly gardening			2

one in five people have never seen a hedgehog in their back gardens
only a quarter of those who do admitted seeing the animals frequently
