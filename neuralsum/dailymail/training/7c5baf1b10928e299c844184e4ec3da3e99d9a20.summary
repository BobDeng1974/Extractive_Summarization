by @entity0 children who recognise the logos of fast food chains such as @entity4 's are more likely to be fat , a new study claims the glowing neon signs of @entity4 's , @entity7 and other fast food chains can be seen in almost every city across the globe			1
and now researchers have found that children as young as three who recognise the logos of the restaurants , are more likely to be fat			1
a new study revealed that children who could also recall the brand names of soft drinks and unhealthy snack brands are more likely to be overweight or obese			1
previous research has shown that children who are overweight tend to maintain an unhealthy weight throughout their lives			1
a team from @entity26 in the @entity27 tested children on their knowledge of various brands - including their ability to identify brand logos such as the @entity4 ’s golden arches			1
they found that those who could identify them most easily tended to have higher body mass indexes , or @entity36			1
‘ we found the relationship between brand knowledge and @entity36 to be quite robust			1
' kids who know most about these brands have higher bmis , ’ said study co-author @entity42 , a professor of advertising and public relations			2
children between the ages of three and five were given pictures of unhealthy food - related logos			2
they were then handed images of food items , packaging and cartoon characters and asked to match the items with their corresponding brand logos , according to the study which was published in the journal @entity57			2
professor @entity42 said : ‘ the results varied , which is a good thing			0
' some kids knew very little about the brands while others knew them exceptionally well			0
’ the team found that among one group , exercise tended to offset the negative effects of too much familiarity with unhealthy food			0
but that finding could not be duplicated in the second group			0
professor @entity42 explained : ‘ the inconsistency across studies tells us that physical activity should not be seen as a cure - all in fixing childhood obesity			2
‘ of course we want kids to be active , but the results from these studies suggest that physical activity is not the only answer			0
the researchers wanted to find out whether a sedentary lifestyle and watching too much tv ( illustrated with a stock image ) makes children fat , or if it is the unhealthy food messages that children see on it			1
they think it is not just the tv time itself but what is learned through the brands parents spend on average £ 26 a month feeding their children fast food , pizza and burgers – and most lie to their friends for fear of being judged			1
a survey released last month found more than a third of children under 10 are eating junk food every day			2
this is despite parents saying they try to monitor their calorie intake and worrying their children ’s consumption of crisps and chocolate is ' out of control '			0
a fifth of parents admitted they regularly lie to others about how much pizza , chocolate and crisps their children are eating and 25 per cent said they lied because they felt guilty about the amount of junk food their children are eating			0
almost half of parents confessed their children were overweight and 35 per cent said they think their child ’s junk food consumption is out of control			2
' the consistent relationship between brand knowledge and @entity36 suggests that limiting advertising exposure might be a step in the right direction too			1
’ she said that because children get most of their food messages from television , the question is what causes more harm - the sedentary lifestyle brought on by too much time in front of the tv , or the unhealthy food messages that children see on it			1
‘ from our results it would suggest that it ’s not the tv time itself , but rather what is learned about these brands			0
it ’s probably the developing food knowledge , not the sedentary lifestyle , ’ she said			1
‘ what we ’re trying to show here is just how young kids are when they develop their theory of food			0
' as early as the age of three , kids are developing a sense of what food means to them			0
’ co-author professor @entity163 said the findings provide more insight into children ’s relationship with food , which she describes as their ‘ first language of food			0
’ she said the study proves it does not take long for children to work out what they do and do n’t like and those choices often remain with them for life .			0

researchers from @entity26 also found that children who know the brand names of soft drinks are more likely to be overweight
previous studies found children who are overweight tend to stay that way
*experts* tested three to five - year - olds on their brand knowledge
they found that children who could identify brands easily had higher @entity195
researchers blame food messages on tv for obesity as well as a sedentary lifestyle and watching too many *programmes*
