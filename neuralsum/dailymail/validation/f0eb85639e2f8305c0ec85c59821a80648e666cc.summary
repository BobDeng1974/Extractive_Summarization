this morning , @entity8 's status page claimed that all its services were functioning well - despite there being problems - but it has now been updated to show that the @entity1 , @entity31 , @entity2 and @entity32 are all ' unavailable to all users ' a post from @entity86 tech giant 's @entity84 twitter handle said : ' @entity87 : you may be receiving an error this morning			1

' in 2014 @entity8 revealed in that it had made $ 18.06 billion in revenue from @entity3 , including its software and services , making up 10 per cent of @entity8 's total net sales			1
if this year 's revenues match 2014 's , the firm could be losing more than $ 2 million an hour - equivalent to $ 34,000 every minute			1
@entity100 - based social media analyst @entity98 tweeted : ' based on 2014 @entity101 : @entity8 are losing $ 34,246 per minute , $ 2,054,794 per hour the # @entity31 is down			0
' seeing as the outage encompasses other services , it could follow that @entity8 's losses are much higher than this			2
@entity105 has previously said that the @entity1 posted $ 4.6 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 , which means that firm could also be losing around $ 2 million an hour , or almost $ 35,000 a minute			1
frustration : in both @entity3 and the app store , users simply see a spinning circle indicating that a song or app is in the process of being downloaded , but nothing happens , as shown in the screenshots above one person tweeted : ' if @entity3 does n't start working within the next two hours i will literally cry ... ' while another said ' @entity31 has been down for like 2 hours			2
' a user called @entity121 said : ' @entity3 , @entity1 is down worldwide , which is screwing up my morning ! has someone hacked them ? # apple # @entity3 ' and a user called lightcap wrote : ' @entity8 's app store is down ( for purchasing , not browsing ) , but the world 's most useless site remains useless as ever ... ' posting a link to the company 's status page			1
making a humorous reference to @entity8 's new macbook , which was unveiled with just one port earlier this week , @entity135 user schwarztech said : ' maybe someone accidentally unplugged the single usb - c cable that the @entity141 runs off of ? ' the outage appears to have been ongoing for several hours this morning , according to @entity143 , which said that ibooks and in - app purchases ca n't be accessed			1
testflight - a service used by developers to test apps - is also down , as well as @entity84 , meaning it is hard for customers to get help in accessing the services			0
earlier today the problems seem to be geographically inconsistent			0
for example , it 's been reported that it 's possible to download apps from the @entity157 , but music tracks are inaccessible			0
but now @entity8 has said the outage is affecting all its users across the world , but has yet to respond to @entity163 's request for comment			0
the @entity1 was last down on monday , but the move was intentional as @entity8 prepared to launch its @entity166 in @entity167 .			0

@entity1 and @entity3 users have taken to @entity135 to complain they are unable to download songs and apps from @entity8 's sites
