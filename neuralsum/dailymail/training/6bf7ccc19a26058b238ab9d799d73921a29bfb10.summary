@entity9 said there was a furious row between businessman @entity0 and his ex-fiancee @entity1			1
she made a frantic call to police – moments before he fell from a fourth - floor window			1
@entity1 had been angrily attempting to order him out of their shared apartment on monday before he died			1
a source said : ‘ he just turned up unannounced inside the flat			0
she said , “ what are you doing here ? you ’re not supposed to be here			0
” he was manic , crazy and probably high			0
‘ @entity1 removed herself from the situation by leaving the building and called the police on the way out			1
‘ she told them , “ you might want to turn up , there ’s a crazy man here			1
” @entity1 headed off to a girlfriend ’s house			1
the police turned up at the apartment and then found him			1
’ police say foul play was not involved and have given no credence to reports that @entity0 ’s death , on monday , was connected with the @entity44 mafia			1
new details have emerged about the relationship between ms @entity1 and @entity0 in the days and weeks leading up to his death , and about the shady business deals he became embroiled in			1
we can reveal that : ms @entity1 , 33 , had told friends that @entity0 had been drinking heavily and using cocaine			1
the @entity56 - born model turned tv presenter had said before he died that he was ‘ in a terrible state ’ and had been threatening to harm himself if she refused to go back to him			2
@entity60 scene : blood , broken railings and police tape where tycoon @entity0 died although they had split up , they had continued to share the apartment until a few days before the fatal incident , when @entity1 had ordered him to live elsewhere			1
she had been making arrangements to change the locks			2
she had said that @entity0 ‘ was not in a good place ’ , had embarrassed her at a number of society events and had at times smelled of alcohol			2
@entity1 , it is said , had been reluctant to publicise the news of their split because of his fragile mental state			2
@entity0 had already attempted suicide , had been into rehab and been sectioned twice under the @entity83			2
it is believed that he had arranged to be admitted to a mental health unit on the day he died			1
property tycoon @entity0 had already attracted considerable notoriety thanks to a bitter divorce dispute with his former wife @entity88 , who in a series of high profile interviews and court hearings had accused him of hiding millions from her and their two daughters			1
the courts had found in @entity88 ’s favour , ordering @entity0 to pay £ 20 million , and he spent time in jail for refusing to disclose details of his complicated finances			2
there was further controversy when it emerged that high - profile individuals , including sir @entity102 the @entity104 owner , had loaned him considerable sums of money			0
however it seems that on a day - to - day basis ms @entity1 was funding his activities – and that this had become a major bone of contention			1
one friend said ms @entity1 had told her : ‘ it ’s not ok to have to pay for a 52 - year - old			1
’ it is understood that ms @entity1 spent time discussing the death with the police on friday , and later met mr @entity0 ’s daughters			1
an indication of @entity0 ’s state of mind before his death was given by his close friend @entity123 , a 64 - year - old businessman from @entity124 , @entity125			1
mr @entity123 said : ‘ he kept phoning and phoning me on monday			0
he was in a terrible state			0
he told me he had booked himself into a mental institution , that he was not well but that he would be out next thursday			0
‘ he was very animated and emotional saying i was his best friend and how much he loved me			0
@entity0 was bi-polar and had been in and out of clinics , he was n’t well			2
it was the stress of it all , he deteriorated in the past five years			0
mr @entity123 added : ‘ i did n’t think he was suicidal			0
he had hopes and plans for the future , he wanted to start a new life and was convinced he would make his money back			0
’ @entity1 had said that @entity0 ‘ was not in a good place ’ , had embarrassed her at a number of society events and had at times smelled of alcohol @entity0 always described himself as a property developer who grew fabulously rich on the back of the building boom of the 1990s and 2000s			1
by 2006 , he had accumulated a £ 60 million property portfolio , including a £ 21 million nine - bedroom mansion in @entity146 , a string of properties in @entity125 ’s exclusive @entity149 , and a £ 6 million mansion in @entity151			2
it is said @entity0 and his associates owned a complete terrace of six stucco - fronted townhouses in @entity157 and a 118ft yacht registered in @entity159 , @entity160			2
in addition , he had an investment portfolio of stocks and shares which netted him around £ 2 million a year , and businesses which paid him a similar amount in commission			0
his total fortune was estimated at a conservative £ 400 million , and he liked to spend it			0
on @entity88 ’s 40th birthday , he presented her with £ 1 million of @entity172 jewellery			0
other presents included a new @entity174 stuffed with couture clothing			0
but it has been claimed that his fortune was based on devising schemes to launder money belonging to the super rich through a web of offshore accounts			0
he used the money to finance huge deals , usually involving property , but sometimes buying and selling fine wines , works of art or vintage sports cars			0
the burgeoning assets market meant that the shrewdly - chosen deals almost always made money for his clients , while providing ways to make shady or undeclared money legitimate			0
former business associates claim that inventive book - keeping could even provide tax shelters for his wealthy clientele			0
he and his partners would , say , pay £ 250,000 for a vintage @entity200 , but claim in accounts that it actually cost far more			0
thus , when the car was later sold on , the declared profit would be tiny and the outlay , which could be claimed against tax , large			0
@entity0 always described himself as a property developer who grew fabulously rich on the back of the building boom of the 1990s and 2000s @entity0 soon came to the notice of businessmen with huge sums of money to launder			2
one was the @entity44 oligarch @entity214 , who amassed an estimated £ 2 billion fortune amid the collapse of the @entity217 and moved to @entity125 in 2000 after falling foul of president @entity219			2
@entity0 and his associates , it is claimed , would take 30 per cent commission on every pound they laundered			2
and as their personal wealth increased , they would increasingly take personal stakes in the quick - turnaround property deals they executed			0
at one stage in the last decade , @entity0 was said to be the single most important client of the upmarket estate agency @entity231 , which specialises in palatial properties			2
but as he grew wealthier , and his work on behalf of exiled @entity44 oligarchs increased , @entity0 began to move in circles where even his famously deft mind could not help him			1
it is said that @entity214 masterminded a secret property investment codenamed @entity239 , which collapsed with enormous debts ten years ago			0
@entity0 at one time owned 50 per cent of the venture , which was based on plans for a giant retail complex in the @entity44 capital			1
he later sold off five per cent shares to eager associates			0
no one knows whether the @entity44 government pulled the plug as part of a ‘ sting operation ’ against @entity214 , but it is certain that @entity0 and his accomplices were badly burned			1
leading figures in the @entity44 mafia are also said to have lost heavily			1
ms @entity1 , 33 , had told her friends that @entity0 had been drinking heavily and using cocaine several of @entity0 ’s closest associates are known to have invested and have since died , including @entity214 , property tycoon @entity261 and @entity262 , a polo friend of prince @entity263			1
a fifth member of the so - called ‘ @entity265 ; around @entity0 , @entity266 , 55 , the former husband of tv presenter @entity268 , died in november after falling from a shopping centre in @entity125			1
a sixth , lawyer @entity270 , who introduced @entity0 to his @entity44 contacts , died in a mysterious helicopter crash in 2004 , a week after telling friends he feared for his life			1
@entity0 ’s fortune was built on a reputation for trustworthiness and discretion			1
so when ex-wife @entity88 engaged on a messy and high - profile divorce after he left her for another woman , it is understood his business associates became instantly alarmed			0
she hired lawyers and forensic accountants to unravel his secretive businesses			0
police say foul play was not involved and have given no credence to reports that @entity0 ’s death , on monday , was connected with the @entity44 mafia in 2009 he was sentenced to six months in prison for refusing to reveal details of his wealth			1
after six years of litigation between the couple , described as ‘ quite extraordinary ’ by a judge , @entity0 was ruled to be worth £ 40 million and ordered to pay his former wife half			2
he never paid a penny , while his daughters ’ school fees and rent for @entity88 ’s home was paid by friends and a series of shadowy companies			2
while claiming penury , @entity0 continued to lead an extravagant lifestyle – living in a luxury penthouse , driving a @entity200 – and then meeting glamorous @entity1			1
when challenged , he insisted he was living off the goodwill of friends			0
@entity88 believed @entity0 had hidden millions from her			0
after his death , she may find that if there is a fortune somewhere , it will be a whole lot harder to track down			0
