a vast underground network of pipes could be used to transport freight and deliveries in a bid to end road congestion and pollution			1
the government has approved funding for @entity10 - based @entity9 to develop the idea as an alternative to the conventional systems of transporting goods by road			1
the plan , called the @entity18 project , aims to reduce the level of road freight within urban areas by using freight pipelines carrying goods in capsules to edge of town consolidation centres , where they would be collected			1
the development project is set to last nine months and if successful could be rolled out in other towns , although it is still a long way from fruition			1
the proposal , would see the driverless capsules propelled by a magnetic wave produced by linear induction motors			0
a track has already been constructed in @entity32 to test the capsules with data being collected on commercial and environmental influences			1
however , the firm say that even irrespective of the final results for the test case , the process established in the project can be used to assess other locations that have major congestion and pollution problems caused by excess road usage			2
the development project is set to last nine months and if successful could be rolled out in other towns dr @entity67 , head of @entity9 told the @entity68 : ' clean water is taken into homes and dirty water is taken away and we never really see it , while huge amounts of oil and diesel are transported by pipes and underground			1
' now we want to do something similar with freight , delivering goods to buildings and taking away waste			0
' the concept has already had funding from the government and is also attracting support from private businesses too			2
the company is already one of several businesses that have attracted support from the @entity91 , a government - funded centre set up to support innovation in transport			2
the @entity91 is currently working with the @entity96 and over 70 major multinationals on ‘ @entity103 ’ inventions with major market potential , including driverless cars , underground sensors and freight pipelines			2
the technology comes after @entity105 announced they had been carrying out a secret research project which would see packages from the company delivered by drone			0
@entity105 has approached the @entity96 about trialling its flying @entity110 in the @entity111			0
one of its prototype delivery drones is pictured in december 2013 , the internet shopping giant ’s chief executive @entity114 says that he wants to use octocoptors to replace postmen and cut delivery times to just 30 minutes			0
customers would have their order dropped onto their front lawn by the machine which would fly through the air from a nearby warehouse with it clasped in a metal grabber			0
and last month , it was reported that @entity105 is said to have approached the @entity96 to launch a trial of the technology in @entity111 .			0

@entity9 is developing the idea as an alternative to road transport
would see capsules *loaded* with goods sent in underground pipelines
a test track has already been built for a nine month development project
the project has approved some government funding from @entity143
