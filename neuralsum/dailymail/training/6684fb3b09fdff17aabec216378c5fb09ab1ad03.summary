@entity5 ’s lawyer , @entity47 , said @entity48 was obliged under international law to allow his client safe passage to @entity18			1
he said : ‘ we will go before the @entity45 to demand that @entity48 complies with its obligations because there is a person who runs the risk of being persecuted politically			2

in the meantime , @entity5 appeared set on rubbing the government ’s nose in its continued failure to arrest him			0
police have been ordered to beef up their presence outside the @entity18 embassy tomorrow ahead of what diplomats described as a ‘ media stunt ’			2

fiasco : a taxi driver falls for a hoax call from a prankster yesterday who ordered a cab to the airport for the @entity6 rebel			1
takeaway pizzas , and a number more cabs were also ordered a diplomatic bag similar to the type that could be used to smuggle mr @entity5 into south @entity111			1
his would , of course , have @entity18 markings and not @entity111 the saga began in late 2010 when @entity14 issued a demand for @entity5 to face questioning over allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two @entity6 supporters , which he denies			1
