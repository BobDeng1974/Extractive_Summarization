@entity0 ponders the question of how he will remember his career if he is unable to recover from serious injury and play again at the highest level			1
‘ it ’s been wonderful , the best of times to be an @entity12 cricketer , and the memories are very special , ’ said the three - time @entity7 winner			1
‘ working hard , winning games and playing a fantastic brand of cricket			2
we had an unbelievable environment in the dressing room and it was just great fun			2
@entity0 has become the co-founder of a professional cycling team during injury lay - off ‘ i remember us saying in 2009 that we wanted to create a club cricket spirit in our dressing room , a bit like playing with your mates on a saturday			1
only we just happened to be playing at @entity29 or @entity30			2
‘ it was a fantastic period that i look back on very fondly despite what has happened in the last year			1
if i do n’t get back , and i ’ve thought about that , then i can honestly say i ’ve achieved most of my goals			2
not all of them , but most			2
‘ every day before play the coach or captain would say , “ let ’s leave everything on the pitch ”			2
and i ’ve done that			2
i ’ve run myself into the ground for my team and for my country and if i finish as a player now having done that i can feel quite proud , i think			1
i can live with that			2
’ we meet to discuss @entity0 ’s new venture in a very different sporting world but it is impossible to escape his old life at the forefront of a golden period for @entity55 cricket which ended so spectacularly and so controversially this year			1
prior has become the co-founder of a professional cycling team at the same time as he faces a very real battle to prolong a cricket career that saw him become one of @entity12 ’s greatest keeper - batsmen and an integral team man			1
@entity12 wicketkeeper prior faces a very real battle to prolong his cricket career the last point is relevant , as are his comments about the ‘ fantastic ’ team environment , for prior also unwittingly found himself at the centre of @entity71 ’s bitter attack on the very foundations of what he was most proud of			1
no one is attacked as spitefully as @entity0 in @entity71 ’s autobiography , where he was derided as the ‘ @entity76 ’ and accused of being at the head of a bullying culture			1
prior has not come to the hotel in @entity80 where we meet to talk about @entity71 but it is clear in his first big interview since publication of the book that rocked the @entity55 cricketing world that a figure who has always been respected for his selfless attitude feels wounded			2
‘ it was sad and it hurt , ’ said @entity0 about his treatment in @entity71 ’s book			1
‘ it was a tough time when it came out , for my family as well as me			1
but we ’ve come through it and i ’m proud of how i handled it			2
it ’s now time to move on			1
‘ i know i said at the time that i wanted a right of reply but having had time to think about it i just want to forget it			1
it ’s about doing what is right for the @entity12 team			1
and what ’s right for the @entity12 team right now is for us all to get behind them in @entity110 and at the @entity111 next year			1
prior was derided as the ‘ @entity76 ’ in @entity71 ’s autobiography ‘ we all should want to do anything we can to help them make @entity12 fans proud			2
that ’s the important thing			2
i have moved on now			2
‘ i ’m so excited with one @entity117 and i ’m cracking on with my rehab			0
all my energy is going into those things			0
there ’s a lot going on in my life and i want to look forward			0
’ it is one @entity117 that has helped him cope with an achilles injury that proved much more serious than first imagined when he withdrew from international cricket last summer in the aftermath of @entity71 ’s bile which even included , among other things , an attack on his desire to take a bike on tour			1
in just three months , prior , at 32 , has helped set up the new professional team who will be competing at @entity137 continental level next year , two levels below the likes of @entity140			1
ultimately , he wants to take them to the world tour			0
‘ i got into cycling a number of years ago when my achilles first began to trouble me because i could n’t run any more and as time went on i got more and more passionate about it , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the cricket schedules are so crazy that you ca n’t think about anything else while you ’re playing but suddenly i found myself out with an injury and time on my hands			1
‘ i ’m really big on the team environment and the exciting thing for me is that it ’s like , “ here you go , here ’s your team , see what you can do with it ”			1
prior celebrating a 3 - 0 @entity7 series win with captain @entity160 at @entity161 in august last year ‘ what i want to do is provide the structure to allow these guys to succeed and achieve their ambitions			1
‘ i ’m hugely involved , not just an ambassador , as co-founder and every decision that ’s been made from the coach , to riders and even the equipment , i ’ve had a hand in			0
’ the whole project has taken three months from fanciful suggestion to reality even though the team will not be officially launched until february			1
it is a positive end to the most horrible of years for prior			0
he was left out of the @entity12 team after the @entity7 were lost in @entity181 , battled his way back when @entity160 wanted him by his side for the start of the new era but then had to concede defeat to injury after the low point of being beaten in the @entity189 by @entity190			1
‘ it got to the point where i knew i was hurt and i could n’t play any more , but it was a big decision to stop , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the thing that hurt me was people saying i just carried on because i was scared of losing my place			0
‘ that definitely was n’t the case			0
i ’m not like that			0
the minute i got dropped from the @entity199 in @entity200 , i grabbed @entity201 and went out and worked with him			0
that ’s not me doing it for show or the cameras			0
i only carried on this summer because i thought i could help the team			1
‘ i knew i could n’t carry on after @entity207 ’s and one of the things that got to me most was hearing @entity210 after that match saying , “ we ’re still backing @entity0 ”			1
but i got to the point where i was spending more time with the physio than i was on the cricket pitch			1
’ the injury to his left achilles , which had clearly been affecting his mobility at @entity29 , had become acute			1
‘ the first thing i said to @entity222 , the @entity12 physio , when i came round after my op was , “ will i play again ? ” he said , “ i would n’t say you wo n’t but it ’s a lot worse than we thought ”			0
the 32 - year - old does not want to give the impression he is giving up ‘ my left tendon was pretty much in two halves			1
i had a 3in tear a centimetre wide running down the achilles			0
it was a mess and they had to put the tendon back together			0
it was a big op. ’ he is three months into a six - month rehabilitation that will make or break his hopes of a return to county , let alone international , cricket			2
‘ i will only know if i can do it again once i get back to playing cricket , ’ says prior			0
‘ only when i ’ve played three or four days back to back , keeping for a lot of overs , will i know			0
i do n’t want to come back half the player i was			0
if i can do myself justice and play to 100 per cent of my capabilities then i ’m in			0
‘ if i lose that yard that allows me to perform at the level i can perform at then i will only get frustrated with myself			0
i ’d have to look at it if i did n’t get back to my old standards but , fingers crossed , hopefully that ’s not the case			0
‘ the other option is playing only as a batsman , which is going through my mind , too , because i ’m pretty certain i can get back to my level just batting			0
‘ the physicality of keeping is very demanding , particularly if you want to embrace that engine room mentality of leading the guys on the field			0
it ’s hard work and physically demanding but that ’s what a keeper has to do			0
’ he does not want to give the impression he is giving up			0
‘ i ’m hugely ambitious to play for @entity12 again but it all depends on what level of fitness i can get back to			0
playing for your country is the greatest honour and biggest achievement you can get			0
to stand in the @entity207 ’s dressing room with your name on the honours board is a very special privilege , something you ca n’t forget as a player			0
‘ if somebody gave me that opportunity again i would bite their hand off			0
’ for now he is concentrating on his new team			2
‘ if you create an environment where people are happy in what they are doing then i believe that ’s how to get the best out of sportsmen			0
it ’s our responsibility to produce that for the guys			0
when you start off as a cricketer you want to play in the @entity7 and the @entity111 , that ’s what drives you , and it ’s no different to us			1
‘ we ’re not saying , “ we ’re going to be unbelievable , we ’re going to be the best ”			0
but we do have goals , aspirations and ambitions			0
‘ the biggest thing in cycling is the @entity309 , so why would n’t we set out to get there one day ? ’ you would not put it past him .			1
