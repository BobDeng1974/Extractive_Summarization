a mother - of - two woke from being sedated to discover all her top teeth had been removed , despite her visiting the dentist to have a new crown fitted			1
@entity4 was plagued by poor dental health for years , and expected to have new crowns fitted when she visited the dentist			1
while the 46 - year - old was deeply sedated , all her upper teeth were removed			1
she was left needing to wear ill - fitting dentures or face going toothless , and became reluctant to leave her home			2
but ms @entity4 can now smile with confidence once more after a pioneering cosmetic dentist stepped in , fitting tooth implants			1
' when i lost all my teeth , it was like losing my personality , ' she said			0
' i could n't even bring myself to go out in public - with my new smile , i 'm a completely different person			2
' @entity4 , 46 , from south @entity20 woke after being sedated in the dentist 's chair to discover all her top teeth had been removed unexpectedly ms @entity4 said she had only visited the dentist to have new crowns fitted and did n't expect to leave toothless			1
for five years she became a recluse , too embarrassed to leave her home ms @entity4 believes her dental problems stem from her mother 's use of antibiotics while she was pregnant			1
despite always looking after her teeth , she found herself needing fillings and other work			2
terrified of being in the dentist 's chair , she was deeply sedated ahead of the dentist performing what ms @entity4 believed would be crown work			1
but instead the mother - of - two woke to find every tooth from her upper gum was missing			2
for six years her ill - fitting dentures plagued ms @entity4 , causing her to become a recluse , only leaving the house to go to work as a teaching assistant			1
scarred by her experience , she refused to step foot inside a dentist surgery , and as a result failed to seek treatment for her decaying bottom teeth			2
the majority fell out and she ended up with just five teeth on her bottom gum			0
now , thanks to @entity58 dental surgeon brothers dr @entity59 and dr @entity60 from @entity61 , ms @entity4 has her smile back			1
the brothers were forced to remove all her remaining teeth , and the rotten stumps from her upper gum during an eight - hour operation worth £ 30,000			1
' i had tried everything to keep my teeth in good shape			0
i had special fluoride toothpaste , i visited the dentist as often as i could - but nothing worked , ' ms @entity4 said			1
' i only had six teeth left on the top but it was enough to keep crowns and not need dentures - that was my worst nightmare			1
' when i left the surgery i was still a bit confused from the sedation - when you 're in that state you have n't got a clue what is going on			0
' it was only when i got home and came round after three or four hours of sleep that i realised what had happened			0
' the horror when i started feeling my mouth and found nothing was unimaginable			0
but ms @entity4 now has her smile back after @entity58 dentists spent eight hours fitting implants ' although i went back a few weeks later to have a dental plate fitted they were uncomfortable and almost impossible to do anything with			1
' she did her best but nothing could make them stick in my mouth			0
' for five years i barely left the house and i was never photographed - i 'd never been so embarrassed			2
' and i was so scared of going back to the dentist that i have n't been able to get my bottom teeth sorted either			2
' i had no quality of life and i constantly cancelled plans so that i did n't have to interact with other people and expose my fangs			0
' i rarely spoke if i did n't have my hand covering my mouth			0
' the difference having tooth implants - i 've never been happier			0
' i 'm out every weekend celebrating my new smile			0
' i 've never been able to go around my head so high until now			0
' dr @entity59 performs more than 80 dental implant procedures a year			0
he said : ' @entity4 had all of her remaining teeth removed - and she did n't have that many left - and a full set of dental implants			1
' for someone so young to have all her teeth removed is quite rare - it 's really much more common for people in their 70s or 80s who would have had all their teeth removed preventatively			1
' this is not a simple procedure and but we 're a specialist clinic			0
' it 's absolutely brilliant to see the difference it has made to @entity4			0
' her new confidence is incredible and i 'm so pleased to see how life - changing it has been for her			0
