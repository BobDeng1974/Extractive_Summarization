by @entity0 published : 19:17 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 03:57 est , 5 march 2013 a coroner banned the naming of bungling firearms officers in a triple murder inquest to protect their human rights			1
in the latest secret justice farce , officers who wrongly allowed @entity7 to own guns were given anonymity to respect their ‘ right to privacy ’			1
police lawyers said their clients were worried about ‘ the way in which they were talked about ’ and feared ‘ media pointing the finger ’			1
inquest : @entity7 ( left ) killed himself and three victims			2
during his inquest the coroner banned the naming of officers involved in the case , including @entity25 ( right ) the ban was overturned following an appeal by the @entity28 and it soon emerged that one of the officers dealing with @entity7 , 42 , had been selling on confiscated firearms while serving with the police			1
it is the latest in a long line of orders banning journalists from reporting on the courts , which are supposed to be open to the public			2
the order was made by coroner @entity40 during the inquest into the death of @entity7 , who killed himself , and three victims			2
the taxi driver , who legally owned six guns , opened fire at his home in @entity47 , near @entity48 in @entity49 , on january 1 last year			0

sole survivor : @entity54 , 19 , who was injured as her mother 's partner @entity7 opened fire at their home in @entity49 the inquest in @entity61 , @entity49 , heard @entity7 had successfully applied for a licence for a shotgun in 2006 and five further guns in 2008			0
officers in the firearms licensing unit at @entity67 knew he had a history of domestic violence and self - harm but decided to grant his application			1
one of them was @entity25 , a firearms inquiry officer later convicted of selling guns			1
in his evidence , @entity25 said he had never seen guidance by the @entity77 or the @entity78 on the issuing of gun certificates			0

mr @entity40 describe the force ’s procedures as ‘ ad hoc ’			0
an investigation by the @entity87 into the shootings found that @entity7 ’s applications had not been properly scrutinised by @entity90			0
six officers were to be made anonymous by mr @entity40			1
the order to hide their names was made under article 8 of the @entity95 despite there being no legal precedent for it in the @entity100 courts			0
but after reading submissions by the @entity28 and other media outlets , the coroner overturned the ruling , saying that open justice was more important			1
@entity25 has since left the force after his conviction in 2010 , where he was given a suspended sentence for selling guns that were due to be destroyed after being surrendered by the public .			2
