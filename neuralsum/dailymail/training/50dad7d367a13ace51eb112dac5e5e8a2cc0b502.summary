he was the @entity1 , a music legend whose incendiary stage act over six decades inspired generations of performers from @entity5 to @entity6			1
but the story of @entity1 , now immortalised by @entity5 in a £ 25 million biopic , @entity9 , has become even more extraordinary in death			1
last night @entity1 ’s widow @entity11 – the mother of his 13 - year - old youngest child @entity12 – revealed for the first time the vicious battle over her husband ’s £ 65 million fortune , how his corpse was dismembered amid a paternity row , and why his body has been moved 14 times since his death because of family feuding			1
‘ @entity12 would be spinning in his grave if he knew the hell i ’d gone through over the past eight years			2
’ @entity1 died on christmas day 2006			1
@entity11 says she has been left ‘ virtually penniless ’ ever since as @entity1 ’s various children – legitimate and otherwise – lawyers , hangers - on and business associates all launched legal claims on his estate			1
she says a will leaving half his fortune to her and the rest to a charitable foundation to help underprivileged children ‘ mysteriously disappeared ’ in the days following his death			1
@entity1 ’s other family rely on a will the singer signed in 2000 , before he married @entity11 and before the birth of @entity12			1
this will lists @entity1 ’s six adult children as the beneficiaries			1
‘ he thought he had provided for me and @entity66 , as he called our son			1
but every piece of scum and slime came crawling out of the woodwork the day he died , ’ she said			2
‘ there have been lawsuits and countersuits ... i know i will prevail eventually , but i ’m in a living hell			2
’ @entity11 was just 25 when she became @entity1 ’s backing singer			1
the genius behind hits including i feel good and @entity81 was 64 and already three times divorced			1
the pair wed in december 2001 , when son @entity12 was six months old			1
but after @entity1 died , his other children – there are at least six and up to as many as nine , depending on who you believe ( the number keeps rising as others come forward claiming he was their father ) – challenged @entity12 ’s legitimacy , claiming @entity1 had undergone a vasectomy in the 1980s			1
telling the story : @entity5 , pictured with one of @entity1 's sons also , has made a biopic a judge ordered a @entity100 test which confirmed @entity1 was @entity12 ’s father			1
@entity11 ’s eyes welled up as she recalled the episode : ‘ they could n’t do the normal dna test because of all the embalming fluid in his body			1
so they had to cut off his legs to get to his bone marrow			2
i wept uncontrollably when i found out			2
my husband , the greatest dancer in the world , had his legs hacked off in death			1
’ but the macabre farce continued			1
the great soul singer ’s body was moved 14 times in the six months after his death , ending up in a temporary grave in the garden of his eldest daughter @entity121 ’s home in @entity123			1
‘ that is the final insult to @entity12 , ’ said @entity11			2
‘ he and i would often talk about his legacy			2
he wanted our home – a 230 - acre estate on @entity129 in @entity130 – to be turned into a living memorial , like @entity132			2
that ’s where he wanted a proper mausoleum			2
‘ but when @entity12 died , i was in @entity135			2
when i returned home , the house was locked with chains on the gate			2
the people who had taken charge had plundered the place			2
they auctioned off some stuff and family members went through like locusts stripping everything that was n’t nailed down			1
’ she says the first time she has been inside the house they shared since his @entity152 death in 2006 was a few week ago after the movie ’s premiere in @entity155 , @entity123			1
‘ i walked through and just wanted to weep			2
the christmas tree was still up , but the presents under the tree from my husband to our son had been opened and ransacked			1
they ’d taken all my jewellery , clothes , furs , all @entity12 ’s awards			2
’ @entity11 is now resigned to the fact that the legal wrangling could go on for years , saying : ‘ my husband was a prolific womaniser			0
there are the children we know about but there are more and more people coming out of the woodwork claiming to be his			0
they are doing dna testing all the time			1
’ @entity11 , who was hired by @entity5 to be a consultant for the new film , is now working with the @entity180 star and his team on a two - hour documentary which will tell the story of the battle over @entity1 ’s estate			1
@entity1 was raised in a brothel by his aunt after his mother abandoned him as an infant and his abusive father refused to care for him			1
it was this rejection that is believed to have led to him becoming a ‘ control freak ’ in later life			1
caring : the soul legend ' never forgot where he came from ' , wanting to help his family and those in poverty ‘ he always insisted on being called mr @entity1 , even by me , ’ she smiles			1
‘ it was about respect			0
this was a man who came from nothing , who dragged himself up by his bootstraps			0
he had talent but he was ahead of his time			0
‘ before @entity1 , black artists did n’t cross over into the mainstream			1
before @entity1 , black artists did n’t control their own music			1
he was a control freak			0
when i swore he would fine me			0
he just wanted people to respect him			0
that ’s what makes what has happened since his death all the more painful			1
‘ they have disrespected his final wishes – to take care of me and his son – and they have disrespected his body			1
‘ @entity12 cared passionately about money			0
he knew what he wanted his legacy to be			0
he wanted to take care of me and @entity66 and the rest would go to a charity helping underprivileged children			0
‘ @entity12 never forgot where he came from			0
he wanted to help poor kids , white and black			0
he knew what it was like to be hungry and have no shoes on his feet			0
he often said he was n’t going to leave money to his older kids because he did n’t want them living off his legacy			0
’ in later life @entity1 struggled with prostate cancer , diabetes and a failing libido			1
‘ i nursed him through the cancer , ’ said @entity11			0
‘ he had arthritis and found it hard to do the splits on stage any more			0
he was using drugs to numb the pain			0
he needed @entity249 to perform on stage and in bed			0
he said it gave him extra energy in both places			0
’ she says her husband would explode in violent rages			0
‘ i forgave him because i knew it was n’t personal , ’ she said			0
‘ i was the only one in his circle who was n’t a “ yes man ”			0
i would disagree with him and he ’d throw things and explode in anger			0
but he was n’t a wife beater			0
he was just a tired , sick , frustrated man and i understood that			0
i forgave the anger and violence			0
’ @entity1 was also prone to intense jealousy			1
@entity11 added : ‘ he built a brick wall around our pool so none of the workers in the house would see me in my bikini			0
’ she believes that drugs may have contributed to her husband ’s death			1
‘ @entity12 was smoking a lot of pot but i could smell something else in there			0
i confronted him about it [ @entity1 had a previous addiction to @entity287 or ‘ angel dust ’ and had freebased cocaine ] but he shrugged it off			1
i think the second i was out of there , @entity12 was smoking pot laced with other , stronger drugs			0
icon : @entity11 said he would ' turn in his grave ' if he knew the trauma the family had gone through ‘ i think it was a lethal combination that killed him			1
people always wanted to party with @entity12 and keep him high			0
was my husband murdered ? we will never know but i will believe he most certainly was until my dying day			0
’ @entity11 and @entity12 now live in @entity306 , where she works as a @entity308 impersonator			0
‘ i ’ve been forced to busk on the streets at times to make ends meet , ’ she said			2
’ she says @entity5 has become a ‘ father figure ’ to her son			2
the pair held a mock ‘ dance - off ’ after the @entity316 premiere of the film			0
the movie is generating @entity321 buzz , especially for @entity322 whose performance as @entity1 has been lauded by critics			1
@entity11 added : ‘ @entity12 was someone who believed everyone was out to take get their hands on his money			0
in death he ’s been proven right			2
‘ the only person who has behaved decently is mr @entity5			0
‘ as for the rest of my husband ’s family and so - called friends , they can rot in hell			2
