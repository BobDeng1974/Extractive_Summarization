by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity4 , the city @entity2 did n’t fancy			1
‘ the place to avoid , ’ said @entity5 sagely , before the draw , while @entity8 chairman and mime - artist @entity7 performed his now - infamous throat slice when the balls conspired to bring them together with @entity13 in this jungle city			1
at midday on thursday , temperatures were pushing through 30 ° c and the air was thick with oppressive humidity of around 70 percent , which is what you might expect in the heart of the world ’s largest equatorial rainforest			1
with its howler monkeys , pink dolphins and mosquitoes it is a long way from @entity29 for the @entity2 manager and his players			2
from the outside the stadium gleamed , designed as it is to resemble the straw baskets produced in the @entity59 region , with 44,500 seats which are the colours of tropical fruits			0
but in the bowels of the stadium , cleaning staff — many wearing masks — were starting a deep clean of @entity2 ’s dressing room			1
the @entity8 ’s head of media @entity68 claims only one member of @entity2 ’s support staff will visit the stadium ahead of kick - off to inspect the facilities			1
they are in for a busy afternoon			0
surprised : @entity2 goalkeeper @entity75 looks stunned that so many fans turned out to see the team into their hotel home : @entity80 and @entity81 look on as the @entity2 team arrive at their @entity4 hotel on thursday as well as the race against time to make sure the dressing - room areas are fully ready and operational , the baths are understood to still be filthy			1
there is also builders ’ dust covering many of the areas including shower rooms , toilets , coaches ’ suite and massage room			1
there are also piles of rubble outside the dressing - room areas and a broken fence by the players ’ entrance			1
two of the workers , who were supposed to be part of the clean - up operation , were lying down and playing with their @entity108 outside on a grass verge			2
what happens to the stadium after the @entity112 is unclear			2
it is one of those new - builds with the look of a white elephant , in what is not a football hotbed , but this problem has been shoved aside			0
there is a party about to start			0
@entity2 versus @entity13 is the first of four group games here and there were sponsors ’ stalls to be erected and car parks to organise			1
there are also air - conditioned marquees , including one set up for the media at one end of the city ’s @entity134 , where the annual carnival procession ends			2
on the roof , television cameras were fixed in place , cables were being connected and a small buggy , the sort which might bring drinks on to the cricket field , buzzed around the dusty concrete passages beneath the stands			0
the big screen was working well as it ran through an @entity2 team featuring @entity39 and @entity149			0
take your pick : @entity2 stars @entity33 , @entity153 and @entity39 grab their luggage as they get off the coach in @entity4 new kid : @entity157 arrives alongside @entity2 manager @entity5 ahead of their @entity112 start not bad : @entity159 tweeted the view from his room in @entity4 upon his arrival newly laid grass verges gasped for a drop of water , fresh tarmac glistened in the heat and signs affixed to the perimeter fence forbade all manner of items to be brought in on match - day			1
these included guns , quite understandably , and flour , less so , and musical instruments and the ear - piercing vuvuzelas which provided the soundtrack to @entity179 ’s @entity112 four years ago			2
not good news for the @entity2 supporters ’ band , but @entity5 and his players have more pressing concerns , most notably the quality of the pitch			2
it was very dry and uneven and bare in patches , despite a torrential downpour on wednesday which left water standing in the streets , and is unlikely to ease the fears raised by @entity5 before the squad left @entity194			0
both teams are due to train at the stadium later today			0
hopefully it plays better than it looks			0
a sluggish surface will not help @entity13 with their passing style any more than it does @entity2 , but there will be a furious reaction from all sides if anyone suffers a pitch - related injury at the start of a tournament which is beamed around the world			1
from afar , the @entity210 issued a statement to say : ‘ with such technology now available there really is no excuse for any stadium — wherever it is in the world — to not have a first - class pitch			2
therefore you have to question at a local level the decision - making processes leading up to the tournament			0
’ feel the heat : @entity223 gets sprayed during @entity2 's training in @entity194 how it looks to the global tv audience may worry @entity227 more			1
there was little visible work being done yesterday , apart from one man pulling a garden rake and another who appeared to be spraying green paint or powder onto the barest patches to enhance appearances			0
however , the @entity8 have been encouraged by reports from pitch experts @entity238 who are responsible for @entity2 ’s training pitch in @entity194 that , although it looks bad , they think it will not play too poorly			0
@entity227 are also playing down the pitch concerns			0
‘ the pitch in @entity4 has been undergoing treatment in preparation for the @entity112 , ’ said a @entity227 spokesman			1
‘ over the last three months , mitigation procedures have been put in place and there continues to be significant improvement			0
pitch experts from @entity227 and the @entity254 are satisfied that the pitch will be ready for training and the matches , and have been based in @entity4 to ensure that all proper procedures are in place			0
’ it will be a shame if the pitch lets @entity4 down , since this city built on rubber is positively bouncing at the prospect of hosting the @entity112 , with streets decked out with green - and - yellow bunting			1
the tensions between mayor @entity268 and @entity5 were eased by @entity2 ’s diplomatic mission in february and the 1.8million people who inhabit @entity4 can not wait for it all to begin .			2

@entity2 arrive at their hotel in @entity4 with temperatures pushing through 30 ° c and the air was thick with oppressive humidity of around 70 percent
