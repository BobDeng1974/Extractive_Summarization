selective dorsal rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			2
the lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contain the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			2
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles and which may not be ' transmitting ' properly are identified and cut			2
due to the size of the nerves and rootlets , this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic			0
many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs			0
