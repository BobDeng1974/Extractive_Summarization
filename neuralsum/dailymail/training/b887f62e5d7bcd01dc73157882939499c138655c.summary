by @entity0 published : 12:56 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 13:19 est , 14 december 2012 a @entity1 awarded to a war hero who was so badly wounded that his wife was wrongly told he was dead has sold for an impressive £ 192,000 - but the tale of valour behind the medal is priceless			1
sergeant @entity7 was awarded the @entity1 in 1901 for jumping from his trench into heavy enemy fire in order to dash across a battlefield to help a wounded man			1
he was shot in the leg and chest but still dragged the casualty to safety with the help of another comrade			1
reward for valour : sgt @entity7 's @entity1 ( pictured left ) was sold for £ 192,000			1
the brave soldier is pictured left wearing his honour after he received it in 1901 sheer horror : an artist 's impression of the boer war - horses were set free and men killed in their beds as the @entity30 launched a 3am ambush his own injuries appeared so bad that military officials sent a telegram home to his wife saying he had been killed			1
she later learned that he had survived and he went on to recover from his wounds suffered in the @entity39 at @entity40 , @entity41			2
the grandson of sergeant @entity7 decided to sell the prestigious medal in order to split the proceeds between his own children			1
it was bought by a @entity49 private collector for £ 160,000			0
with all the fees added on the overall price paid for it was £ 192,000			0
@entity52 , from auctioneers @entity53 and @entity54 , said : ‘ one of the great - grandchildren was at the sale and was quite emotional			0
‘ the seller found himself in the position of being unable to leave the medal to any one child and so decided the best thing would be to let it go to a good home and let all four children benefit from it			0
‘ we were very happy with the price the medal achieves , it was well above the pre-sale estimate			0
’ he added : ‘ as is oft forgotten , the @entity1 is as much issued for saving life as it is for taking it			1
‘ and the gallantry displayed by @entity7 at @entity74 was a classic example of the former			1
respect : he could n't collect his @entity1 from @entity78 , but sergeant @entity7 had the chance to meet @entity80 - who also fought in the @entity30 conflict - at @entity82 in 1945 ‘ he rescued a wounded comrade under a murderous fire at night , himself taking hits in the chest and a thigh			1
‘ indeed such was the serious nature of his resultant wounds that his wife @entity90 received an erroneous @entity92 telegram reporting that he had been killed in action			2
‘ his case has all the drama one might expect of a @entity1 action			2
’ some 2,000 enemy @entity30 soldiers attacked the @entity49 camp at @entity74 at 3am on february 6 , 1901			2
they let loose horses run through the camp in order to disorientate the @entity49 and make them think they were being attacked by the cavalry			0
many were killed in their beds before they had even dressed to respond to the attack			0
twenty - four officers were killed and 53 were badly wounded			2
decorated for bravery : sergeant @entity7 was awarded the @entity110 ( first left ) after he left the safety of the trenches under heavy enemy fire and dashed across a battlefield to help a wounded man @entity117 's valiant actions were true to @entity119 's description of the regiment in his history of the @entity39 - ' @entity122 were no more flurried at three in the morning than at three in the afternoon			1
' but the injuries he suffered in the daring rescue were so extensive that military doctors expected him to die			1
although @entity117 went on to recover and reunite with his wife , his injuries led to him being discharged from the army			1
he was also unable to travel to @entity131 to receive his vc from @entity78 he was invested with it at @entity132 by colonel @entity133 , also a @entity1 winner from the @entity39			2
@entity117 later moved to @entity135 , @entity136 , where he was given the post of barrack warden and was mentioned for valuable service during the the @entity140			0
he retired in 1935 but remained active in the @entity141 until his death in 1953 aged 83			0
vcs rarely come onto the market and when they do are often snapped by @entity145 , the @entity147 peer			0
his collection that is worth five million pounds and includes one tenth of all the 1,351 vcs awarded since 1856 has been donated to the @entity151			0
