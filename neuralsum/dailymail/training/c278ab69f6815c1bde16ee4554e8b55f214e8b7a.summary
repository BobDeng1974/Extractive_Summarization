by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 09:55 est , 25 october 2013 a @entity2 theater is ignoring the age rating of a film with explicit lesbian sex scenes and allowing viewers under the age of 17 to watch it			2
one scene in @entity10 includes a no - holds - barred twelve minute erotic sex sequence between two women , played by @entity13 and @entity14 , that leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination			1
but the @entity18 in @entity19 has said it will not turn away teen - aged viewers			1
one scene in @entity10 includes a no - holds - barred twelve minute erotic sex sequence between two women , played by @entity13 and @entity14 decision : the @entity18 in @entity19 has said it will not turn away teen - aged viewers the theater falls under the same corporate umbrella as @entity26 reported @entity27			1
in a statement , @entity28 , senior veep and general manager of the @entity18 , said that ' high school age patrons ' would be admitted			0

emotional : director @entity40 , left , smiles as @entity14 , right , is kissed by @entity13 after they were presented the @entity43 award for @entity10 the theater added on thursday : ' the @entity46 rating is a voluntary guideline that we as a theater are not obligated to enforce			1
in this case we feel it is unnecessarily restrictive and we will indeed admit high school age patrons to screenings of this perceptive and moving film at the @entity18			2
' @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 , has also announced that they will not be screening the film			0
the owner told the @entity60 reporter ' it is n't because we 're prudes , ' but said the decision was made because the theater 's liquor license prohibits it from showing films featuring ' acts of simulated acts of sexual intercourse ' the steamy three - hour movie about a young lesbian love affair was awarded the prestigious @entity43 award at the @entity72 earlier this year			1

she said : [ @entity40 ] became so crazy that he picked up the little monitor he was viewing it through and threw it into the street , screaming , “ i ca n’t work under these conditions ! ” ' but @entity40 hit back in an open letter slamming his outspoken star : ' @entity84 , who after having repeatedly thanking me publicly and privately and having wept in my arms at @entity72 for allowing her to take on this noble role … has , against all odds and all personal coherence , radically changed her attitude towards me			0
