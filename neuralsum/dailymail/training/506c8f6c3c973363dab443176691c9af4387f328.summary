by @entity0 while it does n’t require you to spend your days in reflective prayer , the latest diet regime to hit the spotlight does recommend that followers mirror the eating habits of the @entity10 monks of @entity11			1
the religious men eat a @entity14 diet made up almost exclusively of unprocessed , fresh , low - fat foods , and also engage in days of fasting where they drastically reduce their calorie intake to clear their minds			1
the monks are obviously doing something right as they have been found to live an astonishing 10 years longer than the average @entity23 person and also tend to be slim and youthful			1
the monasteries of @entity11 are among the world 's healthiest communities			1
the monks live very long lives , largely free of cancers , cardiovascular disease , diabetes and @entity31 's outlined in a new book , @entity33 by @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , the plan aims to eliminate the concept of ‘ dieting ’ and instead splits the week into three types of day ; three moderation days , three fasting days and one feasting , which can be moved around each week to adapt to lifestyle			1
during the three fasting days you cut out all dairy , fish , meat , alcohol , eggs and oil , sticking to small portions of fruits , vegetables , nuts , seeds and beans			0
as well as promising a host of health benefits the @entity57 claims to produce weight loss without a feeling of deprivation the moderation days allow you a healthy , fresh , low - fat , @entity14 diet			1
@entity66 , olive oil , fish , chicken and eggs can all be included , although sugar , processed foods and red meat are still off the menu			0
alcohol is even allowed on these three days - though only red wine in moderation ( 2 units a day ) is allowed			2
the feast day is , as it sounds , a free - for - all , where anything from red meat to cake , mojitos and chocolate is allowed - though the diet does recommend a modicum of restraint in terms of portion size			2
breakfast : @entity91 muesli breakfast pot lunch : chicken soup with toasted wholemeal pitta dinner : baked sweet potato with olives and feta and green salad snacks : an apple , a handful of nuts or seeds breakfast : grilled grapefruit lunch : vegetable soup with a small piece of wholemeal bread dinner : baked butter beans with fresh tomatoes and lettuce snacks : unlimited vegetable sticks breakfast : grilled peaches with @entity23 yogurt lunch : carrot and coriander soup dinner : chicken salad with @entity23 yogurt dressing and a glass of red wine snacks : square of dark chocolate , fruit and vegetable sticks breakfast : muesli lunch : lentil soup dinner : jacket potato with kale and carrots snacks : small bowl of berries , nuts and seeds whatever you want – within reason ! the three days can be placed in any order to make your life easier			2
the book explains : ‘ studies have shown that the monasteries of @entity11 are among the world ’s healthiest communities			1
the monks live very long lives , largely free of cancers , cardiovascular disease , diabetes and @entity31			1
their way of eating also carries with it an enticing by - product : natural weight loss			1
‘ the monks do n’t count calories , nor do they suffer any of the deprivation commonly associated with the ‘ fad ’ diets of the western world			2
@entity170 is not really a ‘ diet ’ , more a way of life			0
' they eat good food and drink good wine , and by following age - old principles of using wholesome ingredients , eating in moderation and exercising regularly , they are among the fittest and healthiest people on earth			2
‘ each monastery is largely self - sufficient and very little produce is bought in from the mainland			0
the monasteries are surrounded by kitchen gardens , orchards , vineyards , beehives and olive groves , and everything produced is organic and seasonal ; much time - consuming effort is required to nurture crops and maintain the maximum possible output from the land			0
' monastery meals are an extension of the daily religious observance , occurring twice a day – morning and evening			0
' meals are consumed in silence , as the monks listen to the daily readings from the scriptures ( with occasional interruptions from the @entity204 )			0
’ @entity34 , one of the authors of @entity33 , who has visited the monks every year for 15 years , spoke to @entity207 about how he came to the conclusion that their eating regime would be beneficial for everyone			1
' the monks are deemed to be amongst the healthiest group of people in the world , with very low cancer rates and almost no @entity31 ’s and after years of living among them i recognised their diet had a large part to play in this , ' @entity34 told @entity207			1
' i always came back feeling fitter , healthier and having lost weight , but i never felt like i had been deprived			0
' we recruit numerous people to test out the monk ’s diet to see if it was applicable in a normal @entity227 life			0
i lost 22lb everybody lost weight ' a key thing we found was that the lack of calorie counting was a large relief			2
' we also found that somewhere along the way , usually at the three or four week mark , you realise that , without any pressure being placed on exactly calories , you are eating differently and what you crave on the feast day changes			0
‘ most people no longer even want the highly - processed , high - sugar foods they did at the beginning			0
