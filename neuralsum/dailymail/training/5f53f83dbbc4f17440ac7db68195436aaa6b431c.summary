@entity1 manager @entity0 says @entity2 and @entity3 are being sold to @entity4 against his wishes			1
the @entity7 club are set to complete the double signing of defender @entity2 , 21 , and goalkeeper @entity3 , 23 , but they will be loaned back to @entity1 for the rest of the season			1
@entity0 , though , is not happy with the deal , thought to be worth in the region of £ 7million for the @entity15 club			1
on the move : @entity2 ( left ) and @entity3 are set to sign for @entity4 ‘ we had an offer from @entity4 , that i was made aware of last week , in regards to the two players going there , ’ he said			1
‘ the figures that were mentioned , by the representative of our club – i said i would not do that deal , when i was asked the question			0
‘ i thought i could push their value up and that they would be worth more in the long run			2
unhappy : but new boss @entity0 is disappointed that the pair are due to be sold ‘ the first i heard today ( monday ) about things was when @entity2 came in and told me that he had a medical at 2pm at @entity4			2
‘ that disappointed me greatly			0
i do not agree with it			0
but the only olive branch i have got is that the boys are both coming back on a year loan , which is a bonus			0

@entity0 unhappy about the sale of of @entity42 and @entity3 to @entity4
deal to be worth £ 7m , with both players loaned back to @entity1 next season
but @entity0 *believes* he could have pushed their values up in the long run
