had circumstances been different , @entity0 would have spent this week crawling around the cutting room floor seeking to lay his hands on the out - takes from last season ’s ignominious @entity6 exit to @entity8			1
when things are so fragile and uncertain in the here and now , however , there is no need to rake throw the annals for examples of how it can all go so horribly wrong			0
@entity16 presently have sufficient examples on file			1
if sunday ’s uninspiring display against @entity21 was perhaps understandable given its close proximity to a fine 2 - 2 draw in @entity24 , then the sequence it continued – just won win in seven competitive games – is a long way from what ’s regarded as acceptable even in a period of transition			1
@entity0 's will name a strong side for the visit of @entity33 on wednesday in the @entity34 @entity35 scored a second - half penalty against @entity21 to salvage a point for @entity16 at the weekend it ’s not hard to have a degree of sympathy with the @entity16 manager ’s current dilemma			1
caught in the middle of a blizzard of games , the @entity44 ’s instinct is to mix and match in the hope the burden can be shared with no adverse effect on results			2
the reality though – as the aforementioned results have underscored – is that even @entity0 ’s first 11 barely stands up to scrutiny at this juncture			1
far less when it relies heavily on the make - weights and the jersey - fillers			2
@entity33 , like @entity8 a year ago , come to @entity60 ’s @entity59 tomorrow as a @entity62 club but that ’s where the similarities end			1
the undefeated leaders and top scorers in the second tier , @entity67 ’s side would not cause the earth to stop spinning on its axis were they to win the tie			2
the @entity60 club suffered a humiliating 1 - 0 cup defeat to lower - league @entity8 exactly a year ago , and want to avoid a repeat against @entity62 side hearts for @entity0 , then , the only way to approach a potentially tricky chicane on what ’s proving a difficult journey is to press the foot firmly to the floor			1
the experiments , such as initially omitting @entity86 and @entity35 as he did on sunday , can wait for now			2
‘ we try to do that every time , ’ @entity0 replied when asked if he ’d field his strongest team			1
‘ this is an important game			0
’ many of @entity0 ’s predecessors uttered those same words ahead of games in this competition without truly believing them			1
yet where the @entity44 differs from @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 is that those men had the safety net of domestic and @entity103 success to fall back on if their fourth priority of the season came unstuck			0
@entity0 can ill - afford to be so choosy			1
for all he is being granted a degree of understanding by @entity16 fans – with his eventual record at @entity110 being the sole basis for that faith – he appreciates that the promise of ‘ jam tomorrow ’ has a hollow ring at the club who now employ him			1
@entity16 's players look relaxed in training , but they have struggled to click as a team this season ‘ this is the first trophy we can win and , as i ’ve said all the time , both ( domestic ) cups are important , ’ he added			1
‘ i know the @entity6 is sometimes used for playing younger teams but we have used a lot of our squad the whole time			0
‘ i said when i came here this ( the @entity129 ) was a big goal for me and it ’s a huge goal for the players as well			0
i think it has only been done three times before in the history of @entity16			1
@entity96 the last in 2001 ? it would be fantastic if we could achieve that			0
’ in a league without @entity140 , it ’s by no means inconceivable that even this inconsistent , unconvincing @entity16 side could yet come good and sweep the boards			1
but for that to happen , a radical improvement from all concerned would not come a minute too soon			0
‘ some have done well , some have had ups and downs , ’ @entity0 said of his fringe players			1
‘ consistency is important and when we ’ve changed a lot we ’ve had some bad performances			0
‘ it ’s much easier when you have the central line together ( the spine of the team ) then put players on			0
@entity0 has rotated his squad constantly this season , and has not yet settled on a regular 11 ‘ but against @entity164 and @entity21 there were maybe too many changes			1
you saw it – when they are staying far back it ’s hard to open them up when you do n’t have the leadership from the centre			0
but if we play with more consistency it ’s easier for them to adapt and get a good performance			0
‘ we want to ( change the approach ) but there are a lot of reasons why we do it			0
we ’ve a long hard match programme and you have to give some players the opportunity to get match fit			2
that ’s something we ’re thinking of all the time			0
but this game ( against @entity21 ) there were maybe too many changes , you could see that in the first - half			1
’ that it ’s taking time for @entity0 ’s methods to take root should come as no surprise to anyone who studied his fortunes at @entity195			1
winning the title with the little known side from @entity198 was miraculous but it did not happen overnight			2
for the first two of @entity0 ’s six years there , avoiding relegation was the priority			1
it goes without saying that @entity60 is n’t quite so tolerant			0
winger @entity205 scored for @entity16 against @entity24 on thursday in the 2 - 2 @entity207 draw ‘ every day we get to know one another better and every day we work on improving one another individually and collectively , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ it ’s not starting now , it ’s a process all the time			0
i think the second - half on sunday was a good performance			2
the defence was very good and we opened them up as well			0
but we needed the second goal and we did n’t do that			0
we made it difficult for ourselves in the first - half			2
‘ i want us to play even more together and be even better physically			0
some of those players are coming in and some have been injured for a while			0
so they need to adapt and get fit and that ’s taking more time than i would ’ve wanted			0
’ if his own side have only impressed in fits and starts thus far , @entity0 appreciates that @entity33 already have the look of a well - oiled machine			1
genuine title and cup contenders without question			0
‘ i saw the game against @entity234 on television and they played well that day and we had people at their match on saturday to watch them , ’ he said			2
‘ we have a good knowledge over how they are playing and they are doing very well this season so far			0
‘ it ’s going to be a tough game - the players and i know it - but i ’m looking forward to playing another game so we can bounce back from the result on sunday			2

@entity0 will name a strong side for the match against @entity33
