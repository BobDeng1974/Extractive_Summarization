by @entity0 , @entity2 correspondent and @entity3 published : 05:09 est , 25 august 2012 updated : 09:21 est , 25 august 2012 support : mr @entity5 has backed controversial proposals for a third runway at @entity8 a @entity10 minister risks stoking @entity12 tensions after signalling support for a third runway at @entity8			1
@entity5 , a housing and planning minister , said @entity16 must consider building the runway if it is to remain a ‘ great trading nation ’			1
@entity19 promised not to build a third runway before the election in a bid to attract green voters from the @entity24			1
but in recent months the @entity25 have been wavering - fearing the decision could have hurt the @entity16 economy			1
the @entity24 remain vociferously opposed			1
in an interview with @entity29 , mr @entity5 said ‘ all options ’ for expanding airport capacity in the @entity32 need to be examined to help kick - start the economy			1
the minister is the first to speak out publicly on the issue			0
chancellor @entity35 is also thought to share this view			1
with the economy flatlining , business leaders are calling for either the expansion of @entity8 or for a new airport east of @entity41			2
his comments raise the prospect the @entity25 could abandon their opposition to a third runway as part of the 2015 manifesto			1
mr @entity5 , an amateur pilot , said : ‘ as a great trading nation we need to have sufficient numbers of ports to get people and goods in and out			1
‘ i back the chancellor ’s position to the hilt when he said in the @entity57 we clearly need to review the airport capacity in the @entity32			2
‘ all the options need to be considered while being mindful of our election manifesto			0
’ the minister , who is tipped for promotion in @entity19 's forthcoming reshuffle , is understood to be among a growing number of senior @entity25 who believe the pm should perform a public u-turn on the third runway			1
' @entity69 ' position : it has been suggested transport secretary @entity71 could be moved from her post due to her stance on the runway meanwhile conservative sources have suggested transport secretary @entity71 could lose her post in the planned september reshuffle because of her long - held opposition to the expansion at @entity8			2
senior party members said that , with @entity35 now in favour of the plans , ms @entity71 's stance on the third runway meant she would not be able to remain in position as @entity85			1
however the suggestion was dismissed by others who pointed out that opposing the runway was @entity90 policy			0
mr @entity19 said last month that @entity90 policy would not be changing , but @entity91 , head of transport at the @entity93 , said ms @entity71 's position was ' untenable '			2
' it 's a problem having her as @entity85 with such a local interest in the issue ; given her critical views on @entity8 expansion , it would make sense to replace her , ' he told the @entity102			0
ms @entity71 came to prominence campaigning as a backbencher in her @entity106 constituency as one of the main opponents of the third runway			0
the plans for expansion were ardently opposed by people living around the airport , particularly in the village of @entity114 , which would be wiped out if the plans were given the green light			0
expansion : the village of @entity114 , pictured above with @entity8 in the background , would be built over if plans for a third runway were to go ahead a consultation on airport capacity in the @entity32 has twice been delayed as a result of @entity90 infighting			2
earlier this month @entity126 , the mayor of @entity41 , accused the government of ' pussy - footing around ' on the issue of @entity41 's airport crisis			0
housing minister mr @entity5 also indicated in the interview that he is opposed to possible @entity133 proposals to further deregulate the planning system			2
sources at the @entity133 have indicated that they would consider looking again at the @entity136 , and possibly allowing building on the green belt			0
mr @entity5 said there is no need to build on the green belt			1
' we 're not short of schemes to get housing built , we just need to get out there , roll our sleeves up and get developments going , ' he said			0
' it 's not the case that we 'll never need to do another piece of planning reform			0
but let 's concentrate on what we 've got			0
' we 've got nearly half a million planning applications ready or nearly ready			0

@entity5 says @entity16 must consider building the runway if it is to remain a ' great trading nation '
pm @entity19 promised not to build the third runway - which @entity24 vociferously oppose
