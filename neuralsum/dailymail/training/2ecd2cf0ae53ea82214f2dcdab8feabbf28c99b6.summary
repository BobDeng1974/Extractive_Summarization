it may not be streamlined enough to nip through traffic , but this solar - powered electric bike will at least make hills easier to climb			1
a @entity5 inventor came up with the the @entity6 so he could ride through the mountains effortlessly , and his bike travels at speeds of 14mph ( 22km/h ) without a battery			1
it features large solar panels in front and behind the saddle and these are used to charge the bike as its being used			1
the @entity6 ( pictured ) was designed by @entity5 engineer @entity16			2
it features solar panels in front of , and behind , the saddle that measure 1.6ft ( 0.5 metres ) each , and these are used to constantly charge the bike as its being ridden each of the panels measures 1.6ft ( 0.5 metres )			1
in theory , because they are constantly charging , it means the bike never runs out of energy , and mr @entity16 claims to have clocked more than 1,000 miles ( 1,609km ) in the past three months the 56 - year - old software engineer from @entity31 in the @entity5 said : ‘ i used to have a motorcycle that i made trips through @entity36 's @entity35 mountains on			1
‘ i decided i wanted to do the same with an electric bike - cycling with a normal bicycle is too exhausting in that kind of terrain			2
' each of the panels measures 1.6ft ( 0.5 metres )			1
in theory , because they panels are constantly charging , it means the bike never runs out of energy , and mr @entity16 ( picutred ) claims to have clocked more than 1,000 miles ( 1,609km ) in the past three months the handmade bike ( pictured ) has been patented and only 50 of the bikes will be built and sold , for £ 80,000 ( $ 126,000 ) each			1
mr @entity16 experimented with different sized panels before settling on ones large enough to provide enough energy , but small enough to ride in traffic he admitted that he finds traditional electric bikes ugly , and began wondering if it would be possible to cycle entirely on solar energy			1
‘ some solar bikes were available , but they all used a large trailer for the solar panels and i wanted my bike to be handy in traffic and effortless to ride , even in the absence of sun , ' continued mr @entity16			1
a @entity65 designer recently unveiled an electric bike made entirely from wood			0
the so - called ' ebike ' was built by @entity69 , and has a rechargeable motor that helps with pedalling			0
the development team , which included students from the @entity74 , now has a working prototype together which it is testing in @entity76			0
the designers said they set out to make a new vehicle which would significantly reduce the carbon footprint of more traditional , metal bikes			0
but the wooden vehicle comes with a price tag of £ 3,000 ( $ 4,730 )			0
‘ i imagined how great it would be to cycle just on solar energy without pedalling - just like sailing in the wind			0
‘ people in my field all said that a bicycle on solar energy was not possible but that did n't put me off , in fact it encouraged me to develop the solar bike			0
the handmade bike has been patented and will be tested to enter the @entity96 next summer			0
only 50 of the bikes will be built and sold , for £ 80,000 ( $ 126,000 ) each			1
mr @entity16 taught himself about carbon composites and solar cells since starting the project in 2010			2
he experimented with different sized solar panels until settling on some large enough to provide enough energy , but small enough to ride in traffic			2
without pedalling or using the battery , the sun delivers the energy for a speed that averages 14mph ( 20km/h ) but can go faster			0
‘ this shows how powerful the sun is , ’ continued mr @entity16			2
‘ the solar panels may seem large at first glance , but the @entity6 is easy to handle in traffic and the solar panels perform particularly well , even on semi-cloudy days			2
’ ‘ i always watch out when the weather is sunny so i can ride my solar bike again			0
‘ i do find it funny when @entity119 people pass by , they say : here they already have solar bikes , which we have not got back home yet			0
