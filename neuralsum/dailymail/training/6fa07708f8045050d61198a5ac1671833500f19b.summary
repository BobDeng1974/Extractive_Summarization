it 's a seemingly death - defying stunt that has raised eyebrows over the internet			2
a man known only as @entity4 is filmed jumping out of a plane from 9,000ft and free - falling to the ground - without a parachute			1
what 's more in the incredibly realistic footage , the thrillseeker flies through a hole in the roof of a building , and lands safely on a trampoline - to the applause of those waiting for him			1
the skydiver , named only as @entity4 , is seen jumping out of the plane with no parachute , but is it a fake ? however , it 's revealed that the video , which has gone viral since it was posted online just two days ago , is a stunt for a new trampoline park in the @entity24			1
in the footage , a presenter explains that @entity4 will jump out of the plane without a parachute , fall through a three - by - five metre opening in the top of a roof , and land onto a trampoline			1
' it 's crazy , but we 're going to do it , ' he says			0
it is claimed that there are two things which make the highly implausible stunt possible : the reinforced trampolines that will absorb the impact from the jump , and a ' revolutionary ' geomagnetic positioning system which @entity4 will wear on his belt			2
as the jumper reaches just under 300 feet , the target area - a hole in the roof of a building becomes clear the end of the video reveals that the skydiver , known as @entity4 , has safely landed onto a trampoline ' the natural magnetism of the @entity55 and the magnet that we are attaching to @entity4 have a natural reaction to one another , ' claims one of the stunt engineers featured in the video , adding that they will be able to steer @entity4 through the skyline exactly down onto the trampoline			1
' we do n't have a margin for error , ' says the narrator			0
if @entity4 makes a mistake on this , it 's catastrophic			0
' as the plane ascends , the team on the ground watch its progress on a computer screen			0
as tension mounts @entity4 yells : ' i 'm throwing myself out of an aeroplane with no parachute ! ' the door opens and @entity4 and a female jumper , who is allegedly filming the stunt , hurl themselves out of the plane			1
the end of the video shows a crowd triumphantly cheering the success of the largely unbelievable stunt intensity grows as @entity4 flies full throttle towards the building , and reaches fever pitch as he plummets towards the opening in the top of it			2
' i see it , i see it , i got it , i got it , ' he shouts , before the screen goes blank and an error message appears saying ' @entity102 '			0
the video ends triumphantly as the camera pans out to reveal a crowd cheering , as it is revealed the stunt has been pulled off			0
however , online critics have pointed out that it is unusual that the skydiver 's voice seems unaffected by the g - force , and the science behind the stunt is somewhat farcical			0
it has also been suggested that the video is in fact a marketing ploy of the brand new @entity119 trampoline park in @entity120 .			2
