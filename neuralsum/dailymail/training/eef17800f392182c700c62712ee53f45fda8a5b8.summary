@entity0 scored a last - gasp winner - his third of the night - to fire @entity3 to a 3 - 2 win over @entity5 in @entity6 of the @entity7			1
@entity0 opened the scoring from the penalty spot , before @entity5 found a way back into the game and went 2 - 1 up			2
late on though , a double by the @entity14 star kept @entity3 's @entity7 hopes alive			0
@entity16 's @entity15 rates the players ' performances at the @entity19 on tuesday night			0
@entity3 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 @entity20 5 wrong - footed for the @entity22 free kick – moved the wrong way and allowed @entity5 back in the game @entity25 5 surging runs early on but allowed @entity27 to beat him for the second and could n’t contain @entity28 @entity29 5.5 not commanding enough for the second goal even if @entity32 was the closest man			1
not his best night @entity20 's error for the @entity22 free - kick allowed the visitors back into the game @entity36 5 clumsy foul which gave away the free kick to present @entity5 with the opportunity to equalise			2
unconvincing @entity40 5.5 good on the offensive and troubled @entity41 – less good at closing down the cross for the second @entity5 goal @entity45 6.5 over-run for long periods in first half even once @entity5 were down to ten men – but improved and had good curling shot just wide on 52 minutes @entity51 ( right ) was one of @entity3 's better players as they clawed their way back @entity54 6 started well but like the rest of his team - mates found it hard to cope with @entity5 ’s passing machine @entity60 6 looked lively early on , got in behind @entity61 but delivery could have been better at times @entity51 7 superb ball to put @entity0 through to earn the penalty for the first goal – but struggled to break up @entity5 ’s incessant passing @entity68 ( left ) caused @entity5 's defence problems early on , but faded for periods of the game @entity68 6.5 was causing @entity5 ’s defence multiple problems early on			1
faded in the first half but started the second well again @entity0 8 - star man @entity77 exploited @entity5 ’s mistakes			2
@entity3 ’s saviour – they would be half the team without him manager : @entity82 6 his team was out - passed and outclassed for periods against ten men for long periods – but was rescued by @entity0 @entity0 saved @entity3 - they would have been down and out without him exploiting @entity5 's mistakes subs @entity88 6 ( for @entity89 ) came on to give @entity3 some added thrust - with limited success @entity91 6 ( for @entity92 65 ) worked hard but struggled to create an impact @entity94 ( for @entity0 90 ) @entity5 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 @entity95 7 no chance with the penalty - though he got close - and a great save from @entity51 ’s shot in the second half @entity41 6 had some difficulty containing @entity68 but rarely troubled after @entity3 ’s initial twenty - minute burst @entity102 4 a miserable and short night for the summer @entity3 target – his red card tackle was an unacceptable risk so early in the game @entity102 ( right ) was @entity5 's worst player , simply for the challenge that earned him a red card @entity109 5 a lovely cross to set up @entity27 for @entity5 ’s second – but ruined a fine performance with dreadful mistake for the winner @entity61 6 suffered early on against @entity60 but grew in composure and effective going forward @entity22 7 ran the game for 85 minutes – even down to 10 men he continued to dictate the tempo			1
but uncharacteristically gave the ball away to allow @entity3 back in the game @entity22 ( centre ) ran the game for 85 minutes and even when @entity5 were down to 10 he dictated the tempo @entity124 6 finally gets his first start since september and is hauled off after 25 minutes for tactical adjustments enforced by the red card @entity128 7 a revelation			1
not first choice for @entity131 but slotted in just fine to the passing carousel			0
looked at ease @entity134 7.5 still scampering away with his dangerous runs			0
always a threat to @entity3			0
@entity134 was always a threat to the @entity3 defence with his dangerous runs throughout @entity27 7.5 not the most elegant of headers for @entity5 ’s second – but could n’t fault his positioning nor his instinct @entity28 7 @entity32 and then played with intelligence when down to ten men – instrumental in pushing the @entity3 wall to create space for @entity22 ’s goal subs @entity149 6.5 ( 25 min for @entity124 ) solid and composed when called upon to replace @entity102 @entity131 ( left ) and @entity82 watch on during the match at the @entity19 on tuesday @entity152 ( 80 mins for @entity28 ) @entity153 ( 84 for @entity27 ) manager : @entity131 7.5 rested the big guns in @entity156 and @entity157 , lost @entity102 to a red card but his team barely missed a beat – until those dreadful late errors			1
tactically excellent though ref @entity163 ( @entity164 ) 6.5 got the call on the penalty and the red card right			0

@entity0 was the star man after his hat - trick saved @entity3
@entity102 had a miserable and short night at the @entity19 for @entity5
@entity22 ran the game for 85 minutes - even with his side down to 10
@entity131 rested his big guns , but his team hardly missed a beat *...* until @entity0 turned up , that is
