by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 despite losing to @entity4 on saturday , @entity3 coach @entity2 will have been pleased with a number of indidual displays			1
here , @entity0 looks into the three close calls that @entity8 will have to make this week			0
@entity9 vs @entity10 ( no 8 ) @entity10 has been a rampaging force of nature for @entity13 and @entity3 all season			1
he propels his team over the gainline repeatedly , but limped off at @entity17 last weekend and it remains to be seen if he is 100 per cent fit			0
@entity9 was herculean with his carrying and collision work on saturday and made a strong case to survive			2
power : @entity9 ( centre ) put in a brilliant performance against @entity4 on saturday @entity25 vs @entity26 vs @entity27 ( @entity28 ) suddenly , @entity3 will have a raft of options			1
if @entity26 is fit , he is the established first choice , but @entity25 was electric , showing pace , footwork and good distribution			2
@entity27 played at outside centre in the @entity36 but @entity37 shone there on saturday , so the @entity38 will come into this equation			0
in the frame : @entity26 ( left ) and @entity25 can both do the job for @entity2 talent : @entity25 ( left ) moves away from @entity43 during the match against @entity4 @entity45 vs @entity46 ( right wing ) this wasnâ € ™ t an occasion when @entity45 was able to cut loose and show his qualities as an attacking runner and predatory finisher , and his yellow card will count against him			1
@entity46 enjoyed a prolific , positive end to the domestic season and is surely in the mix , but if he does come in , it could be at the expense of @entity58			0
up and down : @entity45 is a predatory finisher but was shown a yellow card during @entity3 's defeat against			0

the @entity3 coaches have a number of *difficult* *decisions* to make after *impressive* *individual* displays from several @entity3 players
@entity2 must choose between @entity9 and @entity10
@entity26 faces *competition* from @entity25 and @entity27
