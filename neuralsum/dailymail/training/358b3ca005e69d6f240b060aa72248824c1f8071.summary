by @entity0 a spectacular mansion in rural @entity2 has gone on the market for £ 1.1million - the same price as an ordinary one - bedroom flat in central @entity6			1
@entity7 , which has more than 80 rooms , is being sold by artist @entity9 , who has been using it as a personal gallery since 2003			1
however , he has now decided that the @entity12 - listed house - near the city of @entity15 in @entity16 - is too big for him , as he does not take advantage of its full 28,000 sq / ft and is frequently embarrassed when visitors comment on the size of his home			2
for sale : @entity7 is currently on the market for £ 1.1million - even though it has more than 80 rooms luxurious : but the property only costs as much as a one - bedroom flat in central @entity6 after a planned sale fell through , the property has returned to the market with a £ 1.1million asking price - or £ 1.68million including a coach house and row of cottages on the eight - acre grounds			1
the @entity33 - style mansion is dominated by magnificent @entity35 columns , while inside the walls are dominated by the artworks of its current owner			0
' in total there are 87 spaces in the house and you can go for a walk inside , ' mr @entity9 said			2
' people are dumbstruck when they go inside			0
they do n't know what to say			0
it can be a bit embarrassing			0
' the proportions are really energising and i have really enjoyed living here but it is time for a change			0
the basement and top floor are left on their own at the moment but the middle two floors are used			0
' i think the mansion has got great commercial potential			0
there is room for a bar and spa and it would be excellent for weddings and conferences			0
people are attracted to the period feel			0
' hall : the entrance lobby is decorated in an antique style , dominated by marble columns and flooring ornate : the home was built in the early 19th century for a @entity2 family which had made its fortune in @entity79 the £ 1.1million price tag is the same as a 420sq/ft flat in @entity82 which was recently advertised on the market			1
that tiny home has just one bedroom , one reception room , a tiny kitchen and a shower room - but central @entity6 homes now attract such demand that it was sold for seven figures			1
@entity93 was built between 1824 and 1827 for the @entity95 family , who had made their fortune in @entity79 during the heyday of the @entity98			0
after the home went into decline in the 20th century , it was acquired by the government and turned into a military hospital during the @entity104			2
view : the reception rooms of the home overlook its eight acres of grounds in a beautiful area of @entity2 garden : there is a pond in the grounds which in itself is larger than many people 's homes the house spent several decades providing flats for doctors and nurses , then in 2003 mr @entity9 bought and refurbished the property			1
the home has a number of spectacular features , including marble floors and fireplaces , enormous @entity126 doors , high ceilings and ornate carvings			0
each of the three principal reception rooms flow along the northerly aspect and are connected by magnificent double doors			0
the rooms are highly decorated and have floor - to - ceiling sash and case windows overlooking the terrace			0
home : @entity9 has been living in the house for a decade but has now decided that it is too big for him gallery : mr @entity9 partly used the mansion as a venue to display his artworks @entity146 , from estate agent @entity144 , said : ' @entity93 is one of the most beautiful properties we have ever marketed in this office			2
' it is grand and elegant and everywhere you look there is something beautiful			0
' it is a shame that the earlier sale has fallen through but on the other hand this is a great opportunity for someone else to buy this great house			0
' while £ 1.1million may be much more than most people can afford for a home , it will go a lot further in rural @entity2 than elsewhere in @entity163			1
in the heart of central @entity6 , that amount will only buy you a one - bedroom @entity82 flat with a tiny kitchen and shower room			1
the property market in super-prime areas like @entity82 , @entity173 and @entity174 has been soaring faster than anywhere else in the country thanks to an influx of wealthy new buyers from @entity179 and the @entity180			2
modest : this one - bedroom flat in central @entity6 is on the market for £ 1.1million in the up - and - coming east of the capital , £ 1.1million can get you a four - bedroom terraced house in @entity185 , an early 20th - century home spread over three storeys			1
one of the reasons for the high price tag is that the home comes with a garden - but it is a small patch of lawn not comparable to the eight - acre estate which surrounds @entity7			1
a more spacious family home can be found in the suburbs , where a four - bedroom semi-detached house in @entity198 is currently on the market for £ 1.1million			1
this property boasts four bathrooms , an office and a large open - plan living space , but is comparatively cheaper because of its distance from central @entity6			1
flat : a penthouse in @entity207 , @entity205 costs the same as the gigantic house in @entity2 anyone interested in joining @entity213 's ' @entity212 set ' might take a look at a five - bedroom farmhouse in @entity216 , expected to fetch upwards of £ 1million			1
the home shares the rural charms of @entity7 , but is rather more modest in scale with just a small front garden and a ' delapidated pigsty ' around the back of the house			2
and for the super-rich in need of a holiday home , £ 1.1million is the price of a two - bedroom flat in @entity207 , the @entity205 resort which has become the country 's most exclusive seaside retreat			1
the penthouse apartment owes its asking price to a sun terrace overlooking @entity235 , as well as @entity237 's reputation as a favourite hang - out for the rich and famous .			2

@entity9 bought the 19th - century @entity7 in 2003 and used it as a home and gallery
he is now selling the property in @entity16 , eastern @entity2 with a £ 1.1million asking price because it is too large for him
for the same amount of money , you could get a tiny one - bedroom flat in @entity82 , central @entity6
