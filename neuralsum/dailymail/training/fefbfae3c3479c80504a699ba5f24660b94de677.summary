@entity1 said she lost her confidence after having her first child at the age of 21 and struggling to lose her ‘ mummy tummy ’			1
the part - time beautician , who earns £ 7,000 a year , could not afford the operation and begged doctors to get rid of her bulge			1
after 18 months of visiting her gp , miss @entity1 was referred to a surgeon for the taxpayer - funded operation			1
the single mother - of - three , who once appeared on @entity20 , said : ‘ my new tummy has changed my life			1
' i feel like a new woman			2
i ca n’t wait to start acting lessons now			2
who knows , maybe i could be the next @entity10			2
’ but on an acting website @entity27 admits she has no experience , writing : ‘ the last acting i did was 11 years ago at school ! ' although i did get an a grade in @entity33 so i ca n’t be that bad			2
’ the 27 - year - old believes the operation has actually saved the @entity8 cash , claiming that it would have cost the organisation more money to treat her depression			1
she said : ‘ after my first child my stomach never went back to its normal size			2
then after my third child the midwife said , “ you do know that your stomach muscles have separated from your bulge			1
” ‘ it looked like i was still pregnant and people even asked me , “ how far on are you ? ” it was just so embarrassing			2
i lost all my confidence because of it			1
it was leaving me depressed and ruining my sex life			0
’ miss @entity1 said she ca n't wait to start acting lessons , adding ' who knows , maybe i could be the next @entity10 ' the operation to remove the excess skin on miss @entity1 's abdomen was carried out at @entity62 ( pictured ) last month in desperation , miss @entity1 began investigating cosmetic surgery			1
she said : ‘ i looked online and realised i could n’t afford the £ 5,000 cost so the @entity8 was my only hope			1
‘ at first the doctor recommended physiotherapy and exercise			0
i was seeing her for a couple of months and she said she could n’t repair my stomach muscles			0
’ eventually , miss @entity1 was referred to a surgeon			1
she said : ‘ i was scared because i have never had surgery before but i knew it would change my life			0
’ controversial : @entity76 had her breasts enlarged to @entity78 on the @entity8 - and now wants them reduced , as well as compensation the three - hour operation to remove the excess skin on her abdomen was carried out at @entity62 last month			1
miss @entity1 told @entity84 : ‘ i am more confident and a lot happier than i was			1
it changed my outlook on life			0
it ’s only been four weeks and the scars are still healing but i just feel absolutely brilliant			0
’ but campaigners were outraged at the decision to fund miss @entity1 ’s operation when cuts are being made elsewhere in the @entity8			1
a spokesman from @entity96 said : ‘ it ’s ridiculous that the @entity8 pays for procedures that are not based on strict medical needs			1
patients missing out on vital drugs and treatment will find this deeply unfair			0
’ it follows the case of 23 - year - old @entity105 , who had £ 4,800 breast enlargement surgery on the @entity8 in january after complaining she had been bullied over her flat @entity108 chest			1
but after undergoing the operation , the aspiring model from @entity110 said her 36dd breasts had made her the target of online abuse			2
miss @entity76 then said she would like a reduction and compensation			0
she claimed she was not properly consulted before her operation and wanted compensation for clinical negligence and emotional distress			2
miss @entity76 , who works in telesales , consulted no - win , no - fee lawyers so she can ‘ take [ the @entity8 ] for every penny ’			1
she said : ‘ i want in excess of £ 10,000			0
anything i can get over that is a bonus			0
’ miss @entity76 told @entity84 : ‘ i was rushed through the process			0
i did n’t actually ask for @entity128 — i would have been happier with a b cup			0
‘ but they told me that because i did n’t have any breast tissue i ’d have to go for bigger breasts			0
they have n’t helped me one bit			0
in fact , my life is ruined			0
’ meanwhile , just a few miles away from her home in @entity110 , two - year - old cerebral palsy sufferer @entity137 had been turned down for funding for an operation which could allow him to walk			2
thankfully , after reading about his plight in the @entity145 , generous readers helped to raise the £ 24,000 needed for @entity137 to have his operation privately			2
cosmetic surgery is provided by the @entity8 only if there is a clinical need cosmetic procedures are not normally done on the @entity8 unless doctors decide there is a clinical need			1
this decision is taken at a local level , by the @entity156 ( @entity156 ) , on the basis of reports submitted by a patient 's doctors			2
@entity161 set their own criteria according to what , in their view , are the health needs of the local community			0
for cosmetic surgery , the usual protocol is that the @entity156 must decide there is some kind of clinical , ie health , need for the operation to be funded on the @entity8			1
simply wanting to look nicer in itself is not reason enough			0
@entity176 , also known as @entity8 @entity110 , offers a list of cosmetic procedures that may be available on its website			1
they include breast augmentation , breast reduction , eyelid surgery ( blepharoplasty ) , and rhytidectomy ( wrinkle removal including face lift )			0
it says these may be available ' providing certain criteria can be met ' , and lists the criteria			0
the criteria required for breast augmentation include suffering from certain rare syndromes , severe asymmetry ( more than two cup sizes difference ) , or lumpectomy that results in deformity			0
rare cases , however , such as ms @entity76 's , have to be go through the @entity201 process , in which each case is decided upon its individual merits .			0

@entity1 lost confidence after struggling to lose her ' mummy tummy '
she could not afford operation and begged doctors to get rid of bulge
she says operation will save @entity8 money on treating her for depression
