that much was obvious two minutes into the second half when , having dominated the first 45 minutes , it all went calamitously wrong			2
an innocuous cross from @entity14 was cleared by @entity16 ’s head but from there it clattered against @entity18			1
back it went and in it bounced			2
@entity21 took the lead in fortunate circumstances when @entity16 's header deflected off @entity18 into their own net @entity21 captain @entity26 starts to celebrate as @entity6 keeper @entity27 fails to keep out @entity18 's own goal @entity21 players celebrate in front of their away fans as @entity14 ( centre ) tries to rally the crowd as the @entity21 took the lead @entity6 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity27 5.5 ; @entity35 6.5 , @entity16 6 , @entity36 6 , @entity37 6 ; @entity38 6.5 ( @entity39 81 ) , @entity18 5.5 , @entity40 6 ; @entity41 5.5 ( @entity42 68 , 6 ) , @entity43 6 ( @entity44 81 ) , @entity45 5 subs not used : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 @entity21 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity51 6.5 ; wisdom 6 , @entity53 6 , @entity54 6.5 , @entity55 5.5 ( @entity56 90 ) ; @entity57 6 , @entity58 6.5 ; @entity59 6.5 , @entity60 6 ( @entity61 81 ) , @entity26 7 ; berahino 6.5 ( @entity62 88 ) subs not used : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 booked : @entity58 referee : @entity69 6 att : 31,819 @entity70 : @entity26 @entity6 ’s demolition of @entity72 seems a long time ago now , with their subsequent five games yielding four defeats and a draw			1
the drama is not quite a crisis but the poor run is enough to worry manager @entity79			1
‘ you could argue we were slightly unlucky , ’ he said			2
‘ we are in a difficult run at the moment			2
i have belief in the group we have but we need consistent performances that allow us to compete in games			2
’ that is proving easier said than done , though for inspiration @entity79 might have stolen a glance at @entity21 ’s bench			1
@entity93 was subjected to quite absurd abuse from elements of the club ’s support when he was appointed in the summer , but a run of one defeat in six @entity101 games serves as a vindication			1
‘ i am absolutely delighted with the result , ’ said @entity93 , whose much - changed side were dumped out of the @entity104 by @entity105 on tuesday			2
‘ i will take goals like that			0
it was fortunate the way it went in			0
’ he added : ‘ i am not satisfied with what happened on tuesday — i am still hurting about that			0
but the fact is that had we played the same team on tuesday as last weekend , we would have risked problems at the end of this game			0
‘ we needed players who were physically and mentally ready to cope and they did really well			0
’ for @entity79 , at the very least it was a vast improvement on their offering , or more specifically their application , in last weekend ’s defeat at @entity126			1
at the @entity128 , they lacked intensity and any kind of sharp edge			0
here , with four changes to the side that lost 2 - 0 in @entity134 , including the injury - demotion of @entity42 to the bench , only one of those factors was an issue			0
players and fans observe a minutes silence for @entity143 as tributes were carried out at grounds across the country @entity6 manager @entity79 and @entity21 counterpart @entity93 observe the minutes silence for @entity143 @entity6 captain @entity16 battles for the ball with @entity21 's in - form striker @entity14 at the @entity3 @entity151 miles @entity6 116.0 72.1 @entity40 90 12.6 7.8 @entity45 90 12.4 7.7 @entity18 90 11.3 7.0 @entity21 111.1 69.0 @entity57 90 11.6 7.2 @entity58 90 11.6 7.2 @entity26 90 11.5 7.1 but how many games will you win when only five of 14 shots hit the target — and too few of those troubling the keeper ? within three minutes , @entity45 had a free header inside the six - yard box			1
it travelled weakly into @entity51 ’s arms			0
@entity162 then ballooned over the bar			0
@entity21 almost capitalised moments later but @entity14 followed a moment of quick thinking with slow feet			1
having beaten @entity36 ’s offside trap , he dallied and let the defender get a block in			0
@entity6 ’s @entity43 was then brought down by @entity54 but @entity69 , refereeing his first @entity101 fixture since 2012 , refused to point to the spot			1
more blatant was @entity55 ’s hold on @entity43 at a corner soon after , which also went unpunished , as did @entity36 ’s second - half elbow on @entity14			0
that latter incident looked bad , even if @entity93 said he had no problems with it , having not seen a replay			0
the real sucker punch came in the 47th minute when @entity26 threaded a pass to @entity14			0
the 21 - year - old hit a low cross from the left and @entity16 headed against @entity18 , who nudged the ball past @entity27			1
@entity42 , who had been struggling with a groin problem , came on with 22 minutes remaining and nearly saved his side with a cross from the right that @entity45 headed straight at @entity51			0
such small margins and bad luck could have big consequences for @entity6			1

@entity21 took the three points after @entity16 's *clearance* rebounded off @entity18 for an own goal
defeat leaves @entity6 just off the *relegation* zone in 17th but @entity21 climb to 10th in the @entity101
