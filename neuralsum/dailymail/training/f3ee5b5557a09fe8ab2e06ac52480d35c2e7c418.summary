by @entity0 published : 18:56 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 18:56 est , 24 november 2013 three female @entity2 recruits have each been paid £ 100,000 in compensation by defence chiefs – for injuries caused by marching like men			1
the women said parading in step with male recruits for several weeks forced them to lengthen their stride too far - resulting in spinal and pelvic damage			1
their claims were settled earlier this year following a five - year legal battle with the @entity14 , which accused them of exaggerating their symptoms			1
keeping up : women at this @entity2 base in @entity19 , @entity20 , can be seen marching at the same pace as male recruits critics condemned the ‘ compensation culture ’ within the @entity24 and blamed the case on an ‘ obsession with gender equality ’			1
the payouts are bigger than many of the lump sums paid to soldiers shot on the front line in @entity34			0
former defence minister @entity35 told the @entity36 : ‘ this case is completely and utterly ridiculous - it belongs in the land of the absurd			2
‘ the defence budget is strapped and we ’re making 20,000 troops redundant , yet these former recruits are being paid six - figure sums			2
‘ the @entity14 must stand up to the compensation culture and get the wider public on its side			1
if the @entity2 has erred in its training procedures it is because of society ’s obsession with gender equality			0
’ in settling the case , the @entity14 accepted it had failed to follow guidelines about stride lengths for men and women , and made the women carry the same heavy packs as male recruits			1
@entity2 policy states that women should not have stride lengths longer than 27in , and should be at the front of a march to set the pace			2
compensation : @entity66 , pictured , said she was in agony within weeks of starting her training the female recruits , who were aged 17 , 22 and 23 at the time , were forced to stretch their strides to 30in during basic training at @entity72 , @entity20			1
they have been compensated for nine years of lost earnings and pensions - despite all reportedly having successful careers outside the military			2
the payouts came as the @entity24 ’ compensation bill for 2012/13 topped £ 108.9million - up £ 21million on the previous financial year			1
one of the recruits , @entity66 , said she was in agony within a few weeks of starting training in 2006			1
‘ the guys were over 6ft tall so i was over-striding to march in step with them , ’ she said			0
‘ when i started getting pains in my groin i was told to march through it , even when i was carrying a heavy pack which was almost the size of me			0
‘ i trusted the medics to know better than me so i carried on marching			0
but eventually i could n’t take any more and burst into tears			0
’ an x-ray found that she had four separate pelvic fractures			0
she added : ‘ i was put on crutches and sent home on sick leave			0
my fractures did n’t recover sufficiently for me to complete basic training and in 2008 i was medically discharged			0
’ at the time she was given £ 3,000 in compensation by the military but later sued			2
a spokesman for the @entity14 said it had ‘ legal liability ’ to pay compensation in some cases , and had changed its training practices to ensure the problem did n’t arise again			1
‘ when compensation claims are submitted , they are considered on the basis of whether or not the @entity14 has a legal liability to pay compensation , ’ she said			1
‘ where there is a legal liability to pay compensation we do so			2
the @entity2 takes the welfare of it recruits very seriously and has reviewed its recruit training practices to mitigate against this risk			0
’ in 2007 , the @entity14 paid £ 484,000 to an @entity2 typist who injured her thumb at work			1
the woman , then in her 20s , claimed it caused her to become depressed			0
her award was almost double what a soldier would have received at the time for losing both his legs in the course of duty .			0

the women *'s* claims were settled after a five - year battle with the @entity14
but critics *attacked* a ' compensation culture ' within the armed forces
one recruit , @entity66 , was in ' agony ' and fractured her pelvis four times
