by @entity0 it 's the sort of picture - postcard haven of rural tranquillity seen in tv ’s @entity4 – and indeed it has even featured in the series			1
but perhaps the pace of modern life is finally catching up with the sleepy @entity9 , as new figures reveal it is home to the worst drivers in @entity13			2
one in seven motorists in the tiny @entity16 market town have points on their licence – twice the national average			1
they say ‘ sneaky ’ officers hide behind walls and hedges with a mobile speed camera to catch them going just over the limit as they head out of the town ’s narrow , congested streets			1
@entity39 of car repair garage @entity40 said : ‘ they are extremely sneaky about it			0
the police hide on the corner so people ca n’t see them when they come round the bend			1
if you do things like that you ’re going to catch people , and we do get a lot of it			0
’ @entity54 figures analysed by @entity55 show that as of march this year , 493 of the 3,603 motorists in the @entity58 postcode , which includes @entity22 , had penalty points on their driving licences			1
this proportion – 13.68 per cent – is more than double the national average of 6.47 per cent			0
it is thought that most of @entity22 ’s speeding drivers are caught going over the 30mph limit by a @entity66 parked in a lay - by on the b - road leading out of the town towards the @entity69			1
resident @entity70 said : ‘ the speed camera van is here almost weekly so people should have learned by now			0
i got caught once and i know they ’re here			0
’ @entity74 , chairman of the parish council , said : ‘ our problem is congestion			0
if people can speed they ’re doing well			0
’ but vet ’s receptionist @entity81 said : ‘ people just tear through like it ’s a race track			0
’ that ’s a view echoed by @entity88 - winning actor @entity87 , who became so concerned about lorries using his home town as a rat run between the @entity69 and @entity93 motorways that last year he became the patron of an action group			1
life in the fast lane : @entity9 is home to scores of speeders other places where there are above - average numbers of motorists with licence endorsements are parts of @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			1
across the @entity114 as a whole , far more drivers in @entity113 have picked up penalty points than anywhere else , with experts again putting it down to enthusiastic enforcement			2
@entity121 , chief executive of the @entity122 , said : ‘ while these statistics make interesting reading , in reality it does n’t truly reflect the behaviour of drivers in those areas			0
it is more a reflection of police activity			2
’ @entity54 figures also reveal that men aged 42 to 50 are more likely to have speeding points than drivers of any other age , while men tend to have more points than women			1
@entity141 , president of the @entity142 , said : ‘ men aged 42 to 50 are more likely to have points than younger drivers as they have had more time on the road to accumulate points and do higher mileages			2
‘ generally we find that men tend to take more chances on the road than women and do more miles			0
’ although most drivers lose their licences after accumulating 12 points in a three - year period , judges can allow them to drive if their livelihoods depend on it – and 2,304 currently have 13 or more points			2
one man from @entity163 has 45 points on his licence , which he got for speeding and failing to disclose who was behind the wheel ; a @entity169 driver has 36 points for driving without insurance ; while a woman from @entity173 has 34 .			1

new figures revealed @entity22 , @entity16 is *hotbed* of *bad* driving
tiny market town has featured in long - running series @entity4
but locals say the huge number of licence points are not their fault
instead blame police who hide behind walls and round corners with cameras
