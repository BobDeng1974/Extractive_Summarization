a number of reports suggest the sighting of this test vehicle could mean the @entity1 will hit dealerships as early as this year electric vehicles are a useful tool for fighting city summers , according to a new study			1
switching from vehicles powered by fossil fuels to plug - in equivalents would ease a phenomenon called urban heat island , it said			0
the term describes what happens when city temperatures are driven higher by heat from traffic and air conditioners and by warmth , stored during the day in roads and buildings , which is released at night			0
the researcher 's simulation was based on the weather in the @entity74 capital in the summer of 2012 , when the city was three degrees @entity76 ( 5.4 degrees @entity77 ) warmer than the surrounding countryside			0
switching vehicles to electric would have caused this to fall by 0.94 @entity82 ) , according to their model			2
' heatwaves kill , and in terms of climate change , even one degree can make a difference , ' said @entity90 of @entity91 , who took part in the study			0
earlier this year , a video emerged of the model x doing handling , braking and acceleration in a private lot			2

@entity10 claims the performance model will be able to go from 0 to 60 mph ( 0 to 97 km / h ) in about 4.4 seconds			2
last week , the @entity2 - based company revealed two key software updates for the @entity106 and the model x that he claims will end ' range anxiety '			0
the first is a ' range assurance ' app that communicates with @entity10 's @entity113 network , warning drivers if they are about to run out of power , and pointing them to the nearest supercharger			2
the second is a trip planner , which will combine the supercharger network with the network of @entity101 cars to improve long - distance journeys for drivers			0
other features that will be coming soon include the addition of autosteering for the @entity101 , which should be available in the next three months			0
the technology means drivers will not have to control the wheel , acceleration and braking when the car is on a the motorway			0
in the future , the company will also give driver 's the ability to summon their car to any location .			0
