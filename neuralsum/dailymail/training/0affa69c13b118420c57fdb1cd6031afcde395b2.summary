by @entity1 reporter published : 03:01 est , 20 june 2012 updated : 03:01 est , 20 june 2012 @entity3 officials have warned @entity4 and @entity5 of privacy concerns as the companies fly ' military - grade spy planes ' over cities to gather data for 3d map services			1
staffers for senator @entity13 , a @entity14 from @entity15 , met with @entity4 executives on monday to discuss privacy issues related to the camera - equipped planes			1
they plan to meet with @entity5 on friday			1
the senator 's office also plans to reach out to @entity21 and other companies that may be developing similar technologies			0
' the lawmaker wrote to the rival @entity42 corporations on monday accusing them of ' an unprecedented invasion of privacy ' by using technology capable of imaging objects as small as 4in			1
in his letter , senator @entity13 raised concerns over @entity5 's and @entity4 's reported ' digital mapping plans that use military - grade spy planes with enough precision to see through windows , catch detailed images of private backyard activities , and record images as small as four inches			1
' @entity4 and @entity5 each unveiled new 3d mapping services this month at separate events			1
the maps let users navigate around an aerial view of a city that appears much more realistic than the flat , top - down satellite - based images currently available			0
the two companies are racing to complete the new maps which will be a key feature as they compete to attract users to their rival smartphone offerings			0
big brother : @entity4 and @entity5 have been warned about the potential for breaching privacy with their maps @entity4 said in a statement it does not currently blur aerial imagery taken by the camera - equipped planes because the resolution of the images is n't sharp enough ' for it to be a concern			1
' the company added that it takes privacy ' very seriously			0
' @entity5 â€™s spy planes are believed to be equipped with technology developed by defence agencies to guide missile strikes			1
each plane is equipped with multiple cameras taking high - resolution photographs of buildings and landmarks from every possible angle , which are then compiled to make three - dimensional images			0
the military - grade images are taken at a height of around 1,600ft , meaning people below are very unlikely to realise they are being photographed			0
the cameras can be installed on planes , helicopters or even unmanned drones , although there are safety restrictions about the use of the latter in @entity106			0
a small plane carrying the cameras can photograph up to 100 square kilometres ( 38.6 square miles ) every hour			0
@entity5 said it does not display personally identifiable details such as faces or license plates , and that ' we create optimised pictures taken from multiple shots and remove moving objects such as cars and people from the final image			1
' by the end of the year , @entity4 said it expects to have @entity121 map coverage for metropolitan areas with a combined population of 300million people			1
at an event demonstrating the new maps this month , @entity4 said it was using a fleet of airplanes owned and operated by contractors but flying exclusively for @entity4			2
equipped with custom - designed cameras , the planes fly in ' a very tightly controlled pattern ' over metropolitan areas , taking pictures from 45 - degree angles , @entity4 executives explained			2
the photographs are then used to build @entity121 computer - generated models of the buildings and cityscapes			0
@entity4 has used planes to collect aerial photos in the past , such as following the @entity142 , @entity143 , gas - line explosion			2
but the latest effort marks the company 's most significant use of the planes in a systematic manner to build a standard feature in one of its products			0
you are being watched : @entity154 - style maps are already controversial thanks to @entity4 's data harvesting @entity4 has faced scrutiny over mapping services in the past , such as with the camera - equipped ' @entity154 ' cars that crisscross the globe taking panoramic pictures of streets for its popular mapping service			2
in 2010 , @entity4 acknowledged that the so - called @entity154 cars had collected emails , passwords and other personal data from home wireless networks			2
collecting the @entity172 data was unrelated to the @entity174 project ; it was done so that @entity4 could collect data on @entity172 hot spots that can be used to provide separate location - based services , executives said .			0

officials met @entity4 on monday and will meet with @entity5 on friday
