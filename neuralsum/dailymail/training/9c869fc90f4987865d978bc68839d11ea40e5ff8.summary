crash - test dummies are packing on the pounds to better reflect the expanding waistlines and larger rear ends of many @entity3			1
manufacturer @entity4 has developed the new model after studies found that obese drivers are 78 percent more likely to die in a car crash			1
dummies have traditionally been modeled on a person weighing about 167 pounds with a healthy body mass index			1
a bmi of over 30 is considered morbidly obese by the @entity24			0
seat belts , air bags and other safety features have all been designed for thinner people and do n’t fit larger people in the same way , @entity25 , ceo of @entity4 , told @entity32			0
‘ typically you want someone in a very tight position with their rear against the back of the seat and the seat belt tight to the pelvis , ’ he said			0
‘ an obese person has more mass around midsection and a larger rear which pushes them out of position			1
they sit further forward and the belt does not grasp the pelvis as easily			0
’ a similar conclusion was reached in a 2010 study from the @entity53 and @entity54			0
tight squeeze : seat belts , air bags and other safety features have all traditionally been designed for thinner people and do n’t fit larger people in the same way , according to @entity58 the study , which analyzed data from more than 150,000 car crashes in the @entity3 between 2000 to 2005 , found that moderately obese drivers faced a 21 percent increased risk of death , and morbidly obese drivers faced a 56 percent increased risk of death			1
‘ crash test dummies have saved lives and provided invaluable data on how human bodies react to crashes , but they are designed to represent normal - weight individuals , ’ sais lead author dr. @entity68 at the time			2
with more than 70 percent of @entity3 now clashed as either overweight or obese , according to the @entity24 , @entity75 said the death risk for obese people in cars is a serious problem that must be addressed despite fatal accidents being at historic lows			2
‘ we need to find a way to make cars safer for everyone , regardless of size , ’ he said			0
the data used to create the new dummies also indicated that obese female drivers had double the risk of becoming a fatality compared with obese men			1
the larger dummies are expected to become available to manufacturers for use in testing sometime next year			0
@entity4 has also been developing an age - appropriate dummy to better reflect our aging population .			2
