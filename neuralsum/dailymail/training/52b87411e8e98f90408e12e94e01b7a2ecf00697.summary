fan ownership group @entity0 have set their sights on snapping up 10 per cent of the @entity3 club following a sharp spike in membership			1
former director @entity6 and @entity8 striker @entity7 became the latest high - profile figures to throw their weight behind fan share purchase schemes on tuesday			1
rangers first believe they now have enough fans investing cash to buy 100,000 shares in the club a month			1
the future of the @entity20 giants remains uncertain following continuing financial problems ‘ we are up to nearly 4,400 members , ’ director @entity22 told @entity23			0
‘ the momentum is definitely growing rapidly			0
even amongst former players we are gaining some backing			0
‘ we do n’t want to own @entity3			0
what we seek is representation for supporters on the board			0
‘ our long - term goal is to get to 10 per cent of the shares in @entity13 and then we can actually have a say in what happens			1
‘ we can run matters past our members and see how they wish to vote on it			0
that ’s our main goal			0
‘ we do n’t want to fall out with the board - we want to be represented on the board			0
’ @entity6 , part of the @entity46 group seeking to oust the current board at a forthcoming @entity48 , is one of the new @entity0 members			1
the former @entity3 director has also taken a life membership of @entity52 , a different body with broadly similar goals			0
former @entity13 striker @entity7 has thrown his weight behind @entity58 's 10 per cent bid and has urged @entity13 fans to take destiny into their own hands by throwing their financial muscle behind one of two fan ownership schemes			1
@entity6 , who together with @entity46 and @entity65 , is seeking a place on the @entity3 board at a forthcoming @entity48 , said : ‘ i have today taken out life membership of both the @entity52 and @entity13 first			1
whilst i would like to make special mention of the @entity52 , who have supported our cause tirelessly over the last few years , i wish to make it known that i fully support these two groups in their desire to help safeguard the future of our club			2
‘ along with many of the people who have been working behind the scenes to ensure @entity13 can again function fully , both on and off the pitch , i believe the supporters should be able to participate significantly in the club ’s rehabilitation			1
‘ @entity46 , @entity65 and i are committed to introducing meaningful fan ownership and representation at the club and that is one of the reasons i have pledged my support to both groups			1
@entity7 , pictured celebrating scoring for @entity13 in march 2010 , has backed the share - buying scheme ‘ @entity52 and @entity0 have bought not insignificant amounts of shares and must be recognised by those of us who are striving to remove the current directors and begin the process of repairing the considerable damage caused by a constantly changing @entity103			1
‘ @entity104 and not the needs of individuals must be put back to the top of the priority list and the supporters can help us achieve that goal			0
@entity0 and @entity52 will always have the best interests of their club at heart and they deserve as much support as we can give			1
‘ i would urge as many of this club ’s fans to sign up to either one or both if possible			2
the fans can play a hugely significant part in forcing change through votes			2
‘ they are the most loyal supporters any club could wish for but have been disregarded by a succession of directors in recent years and i for one recognise their contribution in the struggle to end the disgrace and level of mismanagement within @entity3			2
former @entity13 director @entity6 is another person to have put his support behind the scheme ‘ there is now a demand for a general meeting and our fans can make a difference in that process , which hopefully will bring about the changes necessary			1
we have seen what happens when directors with no feel , no understanding and no real concern for @entity13 are in control			2
’ between them @entity0 and @entity52 may yet hold around two per cent of @entity13 around the time of the @entity48			1
the numbers are tight , but with the @entity46 group scrambling for 51 per cent their shares may yet have an influence on the balance of power			1
‘ at the @entity155 game on friday night you could sense a different atmosphere , ’ @entity22 added			0
‘ even within @entity3 people are asking now what they can actually do , asking how supporter representation might work			0
’ @entity7 is the latest former player to sign up and the @entity160 said : ‘ this is not a football club anymore			1
it ’s just about business and money and things like that			0
@entity13 football board chairman @entity168 has bought more than a million extra shares ‘ for me , it ’s like @entity172 and @entity173			1
this club has that history			2
it should be run by the fans - end of			0
there is so much great history at this club and the fans deserve more			2
’ seeking to capitalise on a radio advertising campaign and a publicity blitz , @entity22 claims widespread disgust over the tumult at the club is uniting a previously divided support			0
and @entity6 insisted the wider fan - base must be prepared to stand strong in the face of a war of words that ’s only going to intensify			1
‘ in the lead up to the @entity48 the usual suspects will attempt to undermine our cause because they realise their days could be numbered , ’ he said			0
‘ the truth is that for the first time in years there is a group of people capable of rebuilding and repairing our club and malicious speculation will not deflect us			2
‘ @entity13 have to re-engage with @entity20 football and take our place again at the top table			2
‘ we need to be financially stable again and accept our responsibilities to the game in general			0
@entity208 will come and we can all emerge from a black period in this fantastic club ’s history			0
