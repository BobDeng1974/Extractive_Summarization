for 50 years , @entity0 has been one of football ’s most colourful and outspoken characters			1
now he ’s written a book every fan will want to read			2
in @entity0 ’s new book ' a man @entity8 ' – serialised exclusively by @entity10 this week - the @entity6 manager tells a tale of @entity12 and @entity14 's rivalry			1
@entity12 had just started his career as a pundit with @entity23 and was covering a @entity25 match away in @entity26			1
the presenter told @entity12 there was a special guest coming to see them - someone he might remember from his playing days			1
@entity12 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) midfield battles often turned into heated disputes on the pitch @entity14 takes a swipe at @entity12 during an @entity38 - @entity37 clash at @entity39 in 1999 @entity12 and @entity14 were also ferocious competitors on the pitch , including here in the 2004 @entity42 semi-final age : 43 country : @entity46 position : centre midfield clubs : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity37 , @entity52			1
@entity54 titles , 4x @entity55 , 1x @entity56 , 1x @entity57 , 1x @entity58 , 1x @entity59			0
international caps : 67 @entity62 title			0
age : 38 country : @entity65 position : centre midfield clubs : @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity38 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity25			0
@entity74 titles , 5x @entity55 , 5x @entity75 titles			0
international caps : 107 international honours : 1x @entity78 , 1x @entity79 , 1x @entity80			0
with that , @entity18 could see @entity14 walking towards them , in his new role as a @entity25 ambassador			2
@entity18 says the change in @entity12 ’s demeanour was terrifying : his mood darkened , his eyes narrowed , he stiffened and his grip on the table was almost white - knuckle			2
nearly 10 years after they had last played each other , @entity12 had gone into battle mode			2
@entity12 ( right ) had to be restrained by referee @entity96 ( centre ) after a spat with @entity14 in february 2005 @entity12 ( right ) felt that the @entity38 captain ( left ) was trying to intimidate team - mate @entity99 in the tunnel the duo 's animosity before that @entity58 match was a running theme throughout their battles @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 make @entity0 's modern era @entity111 @entity112 would have solved @entity114 's problems ... he was born to play left wing @entity12 , @entity116 and @entity117 make @entity0 's early era @entity111 @entity119 heralded a change in @entity114 football ... he introduced @entity122 and scouting reports @entity124 has the class of @entity126 but his attitude is holding back his talent why @entity0 fears that the @entity114 manager is in danger of becoming extinct @entity14 nearly crossed @entity131 to join @entity132 ... and @entity133 was close to signing too pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players ... the @entity58 killed all that ! @entity10 's @entity140 interviews @entity0 about his new book @entity18 said it was like being transported back into that tunnel at @entity39 in february 2005			1
@entity14 was completely unsuspecting , approaching the table with a big smile on his face			2
it looked as if it could backfire horribly , but the first words out of @entity14 ’s mouth were so complimentary towards @entity12 it just defused the situation			1
it shows you how much it means to the very top players			0
even all those years later			0
