by @entity0 @entity2 could have a devastating effect on @entity5 's gorilla population , researchers have warned			1
they say the virus has already affected primates - and caused major changes in the way they reproduce			1
it has even broken up groups and forced infected animals out of their families			2
the disease can influence reproductive potential , immigration and social dynamics , researchers say ecologist @entity21 with the @entity22 watched 90 to 95 percent of the gorillas he was studying in a @entity25 sanctuary disappear in two @entity2 outbreaks in the early 2000s			1
he co-authored a scientific assessment that put the western lowland gorilla on the critically endangered list in 2007			0
“ the combination of bushmeat hunting and disease was really slamming western gorillas , ” he said			0
@entity34 and his colleagues estimated that @entity2 would wipe out 45 percent of the entire population in just one generation			1
researcher studied animals affected by a previous outbreak in the @entity41			0
the gorillas that were affected by an ebola virus outbreak shows that disease can influence reproductive potential , immigration and social dynamics			2
researchers say it highlights the need to develop complex models that integrate all the different impacts of a disease			0
this approach requires long - term monitoring of wildlife populations to understand the responses of populations to emerging changes in the environment , according to the @entity61 study			0
' along with the decrease in survival and in reproduction , @entity2 outbreak perturbed social dynamics in gorilla populations , ' said dr. @entity68 of the @entity69 , the senior author of the study			1
scientists estimate that in a worst - case scenario , @entity2 would wipe out 45 percent of the entire population in just one generation ' during outbreak , transfers of both males and females between social units increased			1
' some adult females have been observed transferring to non-breeding groups , which is unusual in non-affected population			2
' although , six year after outbreak , most of vital rates returned to pre epidemic rate , recovery of the population is slow , especially because no compensatory immigration occurred after outbreak indicating that the neighboring populations might have been also affected , '			0

@entity93 has already infected primates
causes changes in their social groups and the way they reproduce
@entity2 could wipe out 45 *%* of population within a generation
