a little over two years ago , @entity0 could barely fill a @entity2 leisure centre but the featherweight from @entity4 now stands on the verge of winning a world title			1
a stoppage victory over @entity9 @entity8 at @entity11 's @entity10 earned the 27 - year - old the right to challenge @entity15 belt holder @entity16			1
@entity0 , nicknamed the ‘ @entity29 ’ due to his slick , evasive style , and formerly the @entity19 , @entity21 and @entity22 champion , dominated from he first bell until 11 seconds before the end of the ninth round when a left hook to the body left @entity8 on the canvas			1
@entity0 ( left ) dominated @entity8 ( right ) before winning in the ninth round at the @entity10 in @entity11 @entity0 's hands are raised as the lad from @entity4 is officially proclaimed the winner in @entity11 @entity0 's stock has risen since joining @entity35 at @entity36 last year			1
indeed , on @entity0 's unveiling , his promoter offered to stake his house on his new charge winning a world title			1
that bet looks more and more like a safe investment as @entity0 ground his opponent down until the clinical and decisive finish			0
@entity8 , who was unbeaten in 27 fights , had broken up his 10,000 mile journey from @entity49 with a stopover in @entity51			0
@entity0 , known as the @entity29 , earns the right to challenge @entity15 belt holder @entity16 but he looked a long way from home as @entity0 established his distance , measured his shots and found his target			1
@entity8 was content to play the role of the aggressor but left himself open to the @entity62 's fast hands			2
a right hand on the bell for the end of the second was an exclamation mark on another successful session and , save for the odd flash of defiance , @entity8 continued to ship punishment in the third round with @entity0 's right uppercut hitting its target as if laser - guided			2
after a quieter fourth stanza , @entity8 again looked short of ideas as @entity0 let his hands go before slipping off and out of reach , like a shadow in the night			2
@entity0 goes to work from range with his left hand on his way to a convincing win over the @entity9 between them , 25 of their combined 47 fights had gone the distance and by the halfway stage here , that trend looked set to continue			0
the penny appeared to drop for @entity8 at the start of the seventh round , however , as the @entity9 doubled his work rate in a bid to reduce his deficit			0
but normal service was resumed in what would prove to be the final session			0
after twice having @entity8 at his mercy against the ropes , @entity0 finished the job at the third attempt , leaving his opponent winded on the canvas with no chance of recovery			2
@entity16 , the champion for 18 months , will defend his title against @entity110 in @entity111 next month			0
@entity0 will be watching with interest .			0

@entity0 beat @entity8 in their @entity15 world *middleweight* title *eliminator*
the @entity62 dominated throughout and stopped @entity8 in the ninth
@entity0 , 27 , now has the right to challenge @entity15 champion @entity16
