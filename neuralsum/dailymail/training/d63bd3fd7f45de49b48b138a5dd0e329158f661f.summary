hero : @entity8 ( pictured ) was burgled days after he was awarded a @entity6 mr @entity8 's daughter , @entity22 , 60 , who also lives in @entity10 , said : ‘ i think he ’s feeling a bit sort of shell shocked about it all			1
‘ your home should be your castle , it should be a place that you are safe and the fact that a stranger can be standing by your bedside , helping themselves to anything they like at night , is not really something you want to be thinking about			2
‘ he ’s quite a strong character , so he ’s quite cross about it - the fact that they ’ve been in and taken his bits and pieces that matter to him			2
’ among the items taken was a commemorative spitfire watch , which was a present from his daughter and son - in - law honouring his years as a wartime @entity50 pilot			1
mr @entity8 was awarded a @entity6 ( pictured ) for his charity work describing the break - in , mrs @entity22 said : ‘ it was @entity54 and my father had gone up to bed about 11.15pm			1
‘ he got disturbed at one point , got up , checked around , and heard what he thinks were fireworks being let off near - by , then went back to bed			1
‘ in the morning , he discovered that he had been broken into and a lower window had been forced in and people had been through the house , going through various bits and pieces and had gone up into his bedroom and gone through his bedroom while he was in bed			1
‘ they took his wallet and his phone , and some watches and then let themselves out			2
’ mrs @entity22 said she was appealing to the people of @entity10 for help catching those responsible			1
she added : ‘ if publicising it helps to catch these people and stop it happening to other people , then that ’s really the most important thing at this stage			0
’ ‘ if somewhere somebody will say ‘ that really is n’t on ’ , and if they do know someone that has turned up with something , they just might give it up			0
’ mr @entity8 has worked for over 40 years to raise funds for charity as a member of @entity95 and as part of the @entity97			1
his daughter said he was probably best known for his part in the club ’s @entity101 collection , which sees him assemble @entity104 ’s float and tow it along behind his white @entity105 to raise money for charity			0
‘ i suppose 90 per cent of his time is spent doing things for other people , ’ mrs @entity22 said			0
‘ he does a lot of work for @entity113 , he spent all the @entity101 period out with a float and grotto that he creates collecting money for good local charities			0
break - in : thieves forced their way into his house through a side window ( file picture ) ‘ i think a lot of people have felt it was something he should have been recognised for , and fortunately on this occasion it came right for him			1
’ she added that her father had been ‘ flattered ’ if somewhat ‘ mystified ’ to find out he had received the honour			0
police sergeant @entity132 , of @entity133 , said : ‘ this gentleman is one of the country ’s heroes , having courageously served as a fighter pilot in the @entity4			0
‘ this remarkable man literally put his life on the line to protect the nation and ensure freedom for future generations and then continued in his civilian life by devoting himself to charity work			0
‘ for someone to break into his house is a despicable act and whoever has done this should be ashamed of themselves			2
‘ we are calling on anyone who knows anything about this burglary to come forward and help us catch those responsible			0
