by @entity1 reporter published : 23:05 est , 11 june 2012 updated : 03:21 est , 12 june 2012 for three decades , it has teased afternoon television viewers with its classic murder mystery plot so you would imagine @entity8 ’s drama @entity6 would be the last thing to fall foul of the censors			0
yesterday , however , tv watchdogs ruled that the 1978 thriller – starring @entity14 as @entity15 – is too violent to be screened on daytime television in its uncut form			0
murder mystery : @entity14 as @entity15 ( standing ) in a scene from @entity6 on the @entity20 following a single complaint from a viewer to @entity25 , @entity22 executives have promised that in future they will edit the closing scene , which shows a character committing suicide , when showing the film before the 9pm watershed			1
the move comes despite the fact that the film has already been shown before that time on more than 20 occasions since 2004 alone			0
a viewer complained after the film was shown at 3.30pm on saturday , march 17			2
in the closing moments , after the murderer has been identified , the character @entity38 – played by @entity39 – shoots her lover in the head off camera			1
she then puts the revolver to her head and shoots herself , causing blood to trickle from the wound			1
the viewer complained to @entity25 that the scene was too violent to be transmitted when children would have been watching – breaching the rule that violence shown before the watershed must be justified by the context			1
@entity25 yesterday criticised @entity22 for screening the scene			1
@entity22 said the criticised scenes were essential to the plot and that @entity8 detective stories were not of particular interest to children it said : ‘ her suicide was shown in some detail and was not appropriately limited			1
‘ given the saturday afternoon scheduling of this film , our assessment was that it was likely that a significant number of children would have been watching @entity22 ’s main and public service channel at this time			2
’ it said audience figures indicated that 71,000 viewers watching were under 16			0
‘ while recognising the importance of including such a pivotal scene , we were concerned that the impact of the second gunshot was not edited or removed , ’ it said			0
@entity22 said the criticised scenes were essential to the plot and that @entity8 detective stories were not of particular interest to children – especially younger children			2
but it said : ‘ in keeping with our periodic review of pre-watershed material and in the light of viewer concerns , particularly those of parents , we undertook some additional editing of this scene for future daytime broadcasts			0

@entity94 complained to @entity25 about scene where woman puts revolver to her head and shoots herself
