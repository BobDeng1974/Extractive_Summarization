by @entity0 for @entity1 yesterday @entity2 , the tough - talking promoter and manager who guided boxer @entity4 to become a boxing world champion , spoke out for the first time about a secret he 'd been hiding his whole life			0
she felt she was a woman trapped in a man 's body and is currently undergoing gender reassignment , having changed her name to @entity15			1
one person that knows only too well the struggle of living life as the wrong sex is @entity21 , who lived for over 50 years as @entity22 , a ' macho man ' desperate to be female			1
opening up : in light of @entity2 's revelation that he is undergoing gender reassignment , @entity21 , pictured , appeared on this morning to tell her similar tale after @entity22 's lies led her into a dark depression and suicide attempt , she realised that she had to be true to herself and for the past seven years has happily lived as @entity21			1
speaking about how she empathises with @entity15 on this morning , @entity21 said the boxing promoter had been ' very brave ' to speak out			1
she added of @entity15 's plans for surgery : ' he 's got to be 120 per cent certain that 's what he wants because once the surgeons have done their work , there 's no going back			2
' speaking about her own experience , @entity21 said : ' i kept it secret all my life			1
you have to be a macho to prove to yourself that these things that are happening should n't be there			0
' @entity21 began to feel different at age of nine but refused to tell anyone what was going through her mind			2
staying quiet : @entity21 worked as a truck driver and married a woman she met at school hiding a secret : @entity21 , pictured as @entity22 , knew there was something different about her from the age of nine but continued to live life as a man and even got married and had children coming out : one day @entity21 's wife found women 's clothes in their house and @entity21 had to come clean but luckily she had a supportive network of friends ' from an early age i started dressing in girl 's clothes and as it went on , in secret all the time , i would hide in the bathroom and hide clothes so nobody knew , ' she said			1
' when i hit my teens , i felt that there was something wrong and thought " why should i be feeling like this ? i 'm a lad			0
it should n't be happening to me			0
" ' @entity21 went on to live life as a man , working in the ' macho ' industry of truck driving with her own haulage business			2
@entity21 even tied the knot with a woman she had met at school ; they went on to be married for thirty years and had children and several grandchildren			1
macho man : @entity21 went on to live life as a man , working in the ' macho ' industry of truck driving with her own haulage business happy at last : speaking on this morning , @entity21 said she feels happy and as though she 's got a second bite of the cherry ' we had many happy years together			1
we had up and downs like everyone else , ' said @entity21 of the marriage			2
' however ' , she adds , ' the older i was getting , the worse i was becoming			0
the more and more @entity21 wanted to be there , @entity22 was getting shut out			1
' one day , her wife found some women 's clothes in their bedroom and she had to come clean			1
' she thought i was having an affair but i told her exactly what was what , ' said @entity21			2
' we tried to talk about it but we could never really discuss it			0
it was at the point where it was never going to be accepted			0
' when @entity21 told her parents , the shock , she says , was that they already knew			2
her greatest fight : boxing promoter @entity2 , who guided fighter @entity4 to the peak of the sport , is now living as a woman called @entity15 , left @entity21 , who says she never had any inkling of being gay , says she is n't doing this for love			1
' i have n't done this because i wanted a man in my life , i 've done this because of who i should 've been from birth			0
' there wo n't be men in @entity21 's life , i do n't think			1
i 'm not closed off to it , if i meet somebody , it would be companionship			0
' speaking about how coming out has changed her life , she added : ' i 've got good friends , both male and female , who 've all stuck by me			0
i had to do something about what happened to me , or i would n't be here			0
' while she has n't seen her grandchildren in the past year , she added : ' at the end of the day , it 's my life , i 've got to have a life			0
i 've got a second bite of the cherry			0

@entity22 is now living as @entity21
first felt she wanted to be a woman aged nine
married a woman for 30 years and had children
her wife found women 's clothes in their house so she *confessed*
now happier than ever living as @entity21
