immigrants who were found hiding in a food lorry entering @entity3			1
fresh food supplies to the @entity3 are being threatened by stowaways fresh food supplies to the @entity3 are coming under threat because illegal immigrants are hiding in the back of lorries , it emerged last night			1
entire truck - loads of imported fruit and vegetables are being destroyed if a migrant is found inside a transportation vehicle , mps heard – and this could lead to a supplies shortage			1
home secretary @entity19 has agreed to an urgent meeting with the ‘ increasingly worried ’ food industry to try to find ways of better protecting imported food from stowaways			1
it is understood that , over the @entity31 period , large quantities of vegetables destined for supermarkets and other retailers had to be ‘ condemned ’ for this reason			1
many migrants clamber aboard lorries as they are being loaded – sometimes as far away as @entity35 – while others sneak aboard later in a journey			0
but once an illegal immigrant is detected by the authorities , either at the port of @entity42 or in the @entity3 , the cargo is deemed ‘ contaminated ’ , no longer considered fit for human consumption and destroyed			2
if this problem persists , it could lead to a shortage of supplies or a rise in food prices to cover the cost of ruined consignments			2
ex-agriculture minister sir @entity52 , who has long - established contacts in the food industry , said : ‘ there ’s ample evidence now that many illegal immigrants are getting into lorries as far afield as @entity35 , particularly lorries bringing fresh food into this country , which means the whole load is condemned			1
‘ our retail sector is now increasingly worried about fresh food supplies			1
’ speaking in the @entity66 , mrs may confirmed officials were ‘ aware ’ of the problem			0
she added : ‘ we are looking to introduce improved ability to identify people who are within lorries when they pass through our controls in @entity42			2
‘ but obviously the problem is often people are getting into the lorries further afield , which even if you find them at @entity42 the load is still considered to have been damaged and contaminated			0
’ the revelations came amid increased pressure on ministers to get a grip on the immigration chaos at @entity42			0
yesterday a member of the @entity83 , which has recently been on a fact - finding trip to the port , revealed the farce of migrants being caught by @entity3 border guards – only to be immediately set free again by the @entity90 authorities			0
many migrants clamber aboard lorries as they are being loaded – sometimes as far away as @entity35 – while others sneak aboard later in a journey @entity3 can stop migrants from travelling to the @entity3 from @entity42 but it is up to the @entity90 to decide whether to deport them			2
@entity98 mp @entity97 then questioned whether the ‘ real problem ’ was that ‘ when potential migrants are apprehended , the @entity90 police take them two miles outside town and release them without even taking their fingerprints , so they can come and do it all over again ’			0
once lorries have reached the country , the @entity106 uses an array of search techniques including sniffer dogs , carbon dioxide detectors , heartbeat monitors , scanners and visual searches to find stowaways			0
last month it emerged that a record 3,000 immigrants a month were caught trying to sneak into the @entity3 illegally , including 420 who were refused entry more than once .			0
