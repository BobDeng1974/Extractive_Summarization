@entity0 is the queen of late night snark and has made a career out of cheerfully taunting celebrities			0
but the chat show host , who will bid farewell to her e ! show @entity8 in august , admits she is quitting because she is totally fed up of stars			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity11 , the statuesque blonde , 39 , said : ' to be quite honest i do n't really care about @entity14 and i do n't want to talk about him anymore			1
in order to make that happen i had to just stop doing my show			2
the blonde is seen interviewing the teen idol on 2011 ' i had to stop doing my show - straight away ! ' @entity0 - seen here hugging @entity14 on her show in 2010 network buddies : @entity0 is leaving @entity26 home to keeping up with the @entity28			1
she will film her last show in august @entity14 , 20 , has often been on @entity8 , flirting with @entity8 and prompting her to tell him once : ' i 'm always better when you 're here			1
' and talking about the troubled teen idol 's drink driving arrest in january , she gave him the advice : ' do n't go out			2
it 's okay to party and have fun and be crazy , but do n't hurt other people			1
you have to do that in the confines of your home			0
and yeah , i 'm all about that			0
i 've got a party at my house all the time			0
... i 'm just a danger to myself , not to others			0
' @entity8 announced her departure from the @entity26 in may , instantly being linked with a move to @entity50 to take over from @entity51 on the @entity52			1
however , @entity8 denied the rumours , saying : ' i 've had seven years of being on the show but i was just kinda over it and tired and i have a really proper new exciting project which will be announced in the next two weeks which i 'm super happy about			1
' i 'm excited more than anything about that			0
' i 'm not doing @entity50 @entity52			0
anything being rumoured is not what i 'm doing			0
i 'm going to do a show			2
it will be a refresh situation , a little bit more mindful and a little bit more interesting for me and my viewers			2
' despite being in a @entity66 clique - and highly protective of friends who include a listers @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 - @entity8 said she was exhausted of being made to cover the shenanigans that surround the @entity28			1
even though she is on the same network as @entity28 - and @entity75 stood in for her while she was away in april - she said : ' i think if you participate in the celebrity world then you do n't really have a choice but to be involved in the drama			1
' you end up getting so into the mix that it changes the topics of the day			2
you can sit around and complain about all that s * * t and the @entity28 all day but if you 're participating in it then what can you do ? it really did n't feel great doing the show and the only way to sort things out was to extricate myself from the entire situation			1
' enough is enough : @entity93 appears on @entity8 - while @entity94 even stood in for @entity8 when the host was away in april just like college : @entity8 , seen with her sidekick @entity97 , said she was ' glad i went ' currently on tour with a show based on her @entity105 bestseller @entity101 , @entity8 plans to take some well deserved r&r when the tour finishes			1
she has plans to travel around @entity112 , @entity113 ' and where ever the wind blows me ... then it will be time to start up a new kind of show			0
' she said : ' now i want to do things differently			0
i want to talk to people who are going to educate me			1
politicians , medical professionals and people with real human interest stories			0
' i want to talk to people who have changed the course of the world			1
inventors , invaders and people who have been doing exciting stuff			0
' @entity26 told @entity134 the last month of @entity8 would feature special guests and special episodes			2
and as ever @entity8 had a sense of humour as she announced the end of the show , saying : ' i myself am more surprised than anyone that i was able to hold down a job for seven years , and it was a fantastic seven years			1
' i will always look back at my time on @entity26 as most people look back at their time in college			0
i ’m glad i went			0
