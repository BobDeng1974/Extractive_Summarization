@entity0 are one of nine clubs expected to be sanctioned in the next few weeks with transfer bans or fines for over-spending in the @entity6 - with @entity0 having posted losses of £ 22.9m last season			1
@entity9 and @entity10 are expected to be hit with massive fines , of around £ 30m and up to £ 20m respectively , under @entity13 financial fair play ( @entity14 ) rules , for racking up huge losses in the 2013 - 14 campaign as they won promotion			1
@entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 as well as @entity0 can expect bans of transfer activity in the january window and in some cases beyond if they do not address their financial issues			0
@entity30 has been deemed unfit to stay in charge of @entity0 by the @entity13 under the @entity13 ’s @entity14 rules , clubs who overspend and succeed by doing so by reaching the lucrative @entity34 are hit with fines - hence @entity9 and @entity10 being hit in the pocket			1
@entity0 ’ punishment could be the last of their worries because their 2013 - 14 accounts , which have not yet been made public , paint an alarming picture of fiscal chaos and uncertainty			1
the @entity46 can reveal that @entity0 ’s income fell to £ 25.3m from £ 28.6m the previous season as gate money , tv money , commercial income and merchandise sales all fell			2
they made a loss of £ 20.4m , and a post-tax loss of £ 22.9m			2
the accounts contain some alarming numbers , notably that minority shareholders @entity59 , who have a 25 per cent stake , are owed £ 20.9m by @entity0 , and that majority owner @entity30 - currently challenging a @entity13 ruling he is unfit to run the club - is owed £ 12.2m he has injected in 2014 either personally or via companies in @entity65 and @entity66			1
@entity0 recorded losses of 22.9m last season and are facing a transfer ban @entity70 , a convicted fraudster , announced last week that he is about to provide £ 15m in extra funding and that @entity59 is to put in £ 5m			1
but it is understood that @entity59 wo n’t actually pay any more money but instead write off a £ 5m payment @entity30 himself is due to make to them on 14 december relating to his buyout			0
when asked how @entity59 could be owed more than £ 20m by @entity0 , a @entity59 spokesman told the @entity46 : ‘ as a result of the poor financial situation which they inherited at the club , @entity59 extended funding of around £ 20m of cash between july 2012 to november 2013 to keep the club solvent , acquire new players , give new contracts to existing players , pay down existing debt and meet other day to day liabilities as they fell due when the club 's revenues were insufficient to do this			2
’ it is not clear how and when this money was put into the club because the accounts do n’t show such an injection			0
@entity70 announced last week that he is going to provide £ 15m in extra funding to @entity0 one source has suggested if @entity70 is forced to relinquish control of @entity0 until a tax evasion conviction is spent in march , @entity59 may temporarily take charge and then hand back the reins			0
another source says casino firm @entity106 are considering an offer for the club			0
both scenarios are ‘ speculative , so far ’ say club insiders			0
another puzzling detail in the accounts is @entity0 ’s wage bill rising to £ 22.4m from £ 20m despite total staff numbers falling from 206 employees to 182 , and a decreased playing staff			2
@entity59 and related parties also took money from the club in 2013 - 14 in the form of £ 2m in interest on loans			1
they also billed @entity0 for £ 3.4m for unspecified services in the year , although the accounts note those invoices are in dispute			2
@entity70 ( centre ) watches @entity0 play @entity128 at @entity129 back in september a rise in @entity0 ’s ‘ cost of sales ’ ( expenses ) at a time of falling revenue , as well as almost £ 2m spent on ‘ legal and professional fees ’ and ‘ management charges ’ also show extraordinarily high levels of undetailed spending for what is , in business terms , such a small company			0
@entity0 are unlikely to contest their transfer ban but @entity9 will almost certainly launch a legal challenge to their fine , expected to be around £ 30m , calculated via a complex tariff based on losses expected to be around £ 40m			1
monies accrued from the ‘ @entity148 ’ will go to charity			0
if @entity9 refuse to pay and are then relegated , the @entity13 have already said they will not be re-admitted to their three divisions and would face having to pay up or banishment to the non-league .			0

several clubs are facing sanctions for breaking @entity13 @entity14 rules
@entity0 posted losses of £ 22.9m last season and are likely to be sanctioned
@entity34 clubs @entity10 and @entity9 are also facing huge fines
