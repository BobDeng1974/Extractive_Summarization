by @entity0 a huge population of wild monkeys is sweeping across @entity3 after being introduced during the filming of @entity5			1
there are now thought to be 1,000 rhesus monkeys roaming the sunshine state - all descended from three males and females released together in the late 1930s			1
the ' couples ' were brought to @entity12 and marooned on a small island near the @entity14 by tour operator @entity15			1
the six original monkeys were marooned on an island near @entity14 as a tourist attraction during the filming of @entity5 finds a son the entrepreneur who owned the monkeys did n't realise they could swim and so they escaped some tour guides say he wanted to capitalise on the success of the 1939 hit @entity27 , which filmed nearby , to promote his jungle tours			1
however the bungling businessman did n't realise the species could swim and they quickly escaped from ' @entity31 ' and started breeding			1
nearly 80 years later some have been seen as far away as @entity34 and @entity35 - more than 100 miles from @entity36 , near @entity37			0
eighty years after they were accidentally introduced the monkeys have been seen up to 100 miles away from @entity14 despite their numbers the monkeys have had no obvious impact on the ecosystem @entity44 's policy is usually to eliminate any feral species - as seen with the well publicised hunt for @entity48 pythons in the @entity49			1
but , in an ironic twist to colonel @entity15 's original plan , the monkeys are now attracting tourists across the state			1
local tour operator captain @entity55 , 65 , said : ' everybody who comes on the river for a tour wants to see the monkeys			1
the monkeys prey on insects and are particularly fond of long - jawed orb - weaver spiders the macaques have also become prey for foxes , owls , bobcats and alligators which leap out of rivers to grab them ' from my point of view , as a naturalist , i think the planet changes naturally and species do move around , whether that is by man or other means			2
' @entity78 is the way the planet works - so i would just keep them			0
' he said the monkeys do not seem to have an obvious impact on the ecosystem and have even become prey for foxes , owls , bobcats and alligators - which leap from the river to snatch them out of trees			2
@entity93 and @entity94 starred as @entity5 and @entity95 in the 1939 film @entity27 which was filmed in @entity3 @entity97 wildlife photographer @entity96 , 42 , is among those who have travelled to @entity99 to see the monkeys			1
he said : ' some of the macaques are braver than others , usually the males			0
nursing females and babies tend to keep further away			0
' the balance of their diet is made up of dirt , insects , and they love spiders			0
long - jawed orb - weaver spiders are common along the banks of the river , and the monkeys eat them like candy			2
' he added : ' they are not a pest to people - people are pest to the macaques			0
people feed them and this is not cool			0
you should never feed wildlife			0
' just like any other wild animal you need to give them space			0
' state officials have caught more than 700 of the monkeys over the last 10 years and found that most tested positive for the herpes - b virus			2
it is because of this disease , which is often lethal to humans but rarely contracted , that some consider the monkeys a public health hazard			2
however , there was controversy in 2012 when the @entity142 reported suspicions that the state catcher had sold captured monkeys on to research laboratories .			0
