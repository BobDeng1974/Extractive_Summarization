@entity0 has continued her attacks on her ex @entity2 in light of his @entity5 tribute by bringing up the claims of sexual assault that one of her adopted daughters made against the famed director			1
she posted a loaded question to her more than 370,000 @entity14 followers on monday , asking them to decide if @entity2 was a pedophile for what he did to her daughter @entity18 in 1992			1
the @entity14 outrage came after @entity2 's former lover and muse @entity22 made a gushing tribute to the director at last night 's @entity5 where he was honored with the prestigious @entity26 award			1
while @entity28 was praising the ' complicated ' female roles that @entity2 writes for women , his estranged son @entity27 and ex @entity0 took the opportunity to remind the world about the filmmaker 's past history of alleged sexual assault			1
her discovery of naked pictures that the director had taken of the then - teenage girl were coupled with sexual assault allegations made by her 7 - year - old daughter @entity18 - who she had adopted with @entity2			1
@entity22 accepted @entity2 's @entity26 award on his behalf at sunday night 's @entity5 , and dedicated a large part of her glowing speech to the roles that he writes for women			1
‘ it 's kind of hard for me to wrap my mind around the fact that 179 of the world 's most captivating actresses have appeared in @entity2 's films and there 's a reason for this			2
the reason is they wanted to , ' she said at the ceremony			0
‘ they wanted to because @entity2 's women ca n't be compartmentalised , right ? i mean , they struggle , they love , they fall apart , they dominate , they 're funny , they 're flawed			2
they are , in fact , the hallmark of @entity2 's work			2
@entity2 was noticeably absent from the affair but that came as little surprise since he has made a point to never attend award ceremonies throughout his career			0
@entity28 , 68 , ended the speech by bizarrely singing the @entity88 anthem			0
@entity28 and @entity2 dated in the 1970s and she starred in eight of his films including @entity91			0
@entity18 's case was never tried and charges were dropped against @entity2 , but they were heard in the custody hearings between @entity0 and @entity2 , and on sunday night , @entity27 made sure that the world did not forget the charges either			1
‘ missed the @entity2 tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after @entity91 ? ’ he tweeted			2
@entity0 , who is also active on @entity14 , made her dig slightly less pointed but direct all the same			2
the @entity104 star had been live tweeting the ceremony , but made it clear that as soon as @entity2 ’s tribute was about to begin , she was switching off			1
‘ time to grab some icecream & switch over to # girls , ’ she wrote , followed by a simple : ‘ nite all			0
’ [ sic ] @entity2 has long denied the claims made by @entity18 - as she said that he sexually assaulted her in the attic of @entity0 's @entity113 home in 1992			1
the judge dropped the case in 1993 to avoid the trauma of @entity18 having to appear in court but said he had ‘ probable cause ’ to prosecute him on sexual molestation charges			0
@entity0 , now 68 , and @entity2 , 78 , separated after the actress discovered the director was having a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter @entity52 , who he is now married to and they now have children of their own			1
@entity27 has cut off all communication from @entity2 and @entity18 has done the same but to an even greater degree			2
speaking publicly for the first time in years , @entity18 - who has since changed her name - told @entity46 that @entity2 tried contacting her twice after the court - ordered no - contact issuance ended when she turned 18 - years - old			2
both times , @entity18 had a visceral reaction to her father 's letters			0
the @entity46 article - which also included @entity0 's suggestion that her ex-husband @entity138 may have actually been @entity27 's biological father - was published in november and written by @entity139			1
ms @entity139 's son , @entity140 , is @entity27 's colleague at @entity141 and after @entity140 tweeted a link to the story during the @entity5 , @entity0 retweeted it			1
outrage : @entity0 continued to tweet about her daughter 's allegations of sexual abuse on monday back in the day : @entity0 and @entity2 ( seen here in 1988 , @entity0 holding @entity27 and @entity2 holding @entity18 ) were together for more than a decade before they split amid allegations that he sexually assaulted @entity18 when she was 7 - years - old complicated : @entity0 adopted @entity150 ( seen together in 1991 ) with her second husband @entity151 but then went on to raise her with her later partner @entity2 , who she split with when his sexual relationship with soon - @entity52 was discovered			1
soon - @entity52 and @entity2 stayed together and are now married ( seen in september ) @entity0 then posted her own link to the story this morning , asking her more than 370,000 followers to decide for themselves whether or not @entity2 is a pedophile			1
sunday night 's tweet was not the first time that @entity27 has bad - mouthed his father , slamming his relationship with @entity52 on @entity161 in 2012			2
' happy father ’s day — or as they call it in my family , happy brother - in - law ’s day , ' @entity27 wrote at the time			0
while his former family members may have been critical of their estranged father and partner , the stars in the room at the @entity5 ceremony were filled with praise , as @entity22 accepted the @entity26 award on @entity2 's behalf			1
the lifetime achievement award was voted on by members of the @entity179 and has previously been awarded to @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 among many others			0
@entity22 , 68 , starred in @entity91 , as well as seven other of @entity2 ’s films , while 25 - year - old @entity185 will be starring in his next project , @entity187			1
@entity22 , even bizarrely sang a little song , and swore during the speech , said : ‘ i think it 's safe to say that @entity2 is an anomaly			0
‘ he 's made 74 movies in 48 years			0
he 's directed them , he 's starred in them , he 's produced them and , of course , he 's written them			0
he 's written all of them , every one			0
’ special honor : @entity22 ( @entity198 ) and @entity199 accepted the @entity26 award on @entity2 's behalf ‘ they wanted to because @entity2 's women ca n't be compartmentalised , right ? i mean , they struggle , they love , they fall apart , they dominate , they 're funny , they 're flawed			2
they are , in fact , the hallmark of @entity2 's work			0
‘ but what 's even more remarkable is that absolutely nothing links these unforgettable characters from the fact that they came from the mind of @entity2			0
and there you have it			0
’ the end of @entity22 ’s speech got cut off because she said how @entity2 would have been thinking ' get the hook and get her off the @entity218 damn stage ' but overzealous censors bleeped out a longer portion of her speech .			0

@entity2 was accused of sexually assaulting his 7 - year - old daughter that he raised with then - partner @entity0 in the early 1990s
now @entity0 asked @entity14 followers to decide if @entity2 was a ' pedophile ' for what he did to her daughter
the girl , @entity18 , was never asked to testify because of her age and the charges were dropped against the famous director
scandal *erupted* during a custody *dispute* between @entity2 and @entity0 - at the same time that he *announced* he was in love with @entity0 's other adopted daughter , soon - @entity52 , who he went on to marry
@entity0 and her *political* activist - turned - @entity243 son @entity27 were live - tweeting the @entity5 and made clear digs at @entity2 's tribute
@entity27 blasted the ceremony 's *decision* to ignore @entity2 's sexual abuse charges and @entity0 said it was ' time to switch ' to watching @entity253 's girls
