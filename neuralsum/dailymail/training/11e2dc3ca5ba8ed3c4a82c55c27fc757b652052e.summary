it was always one of the most unconventional relationships in showbusiness – and now , after 13 years , it has come to an end			1
@entity5 , the @entity7 @entity6 rose , has split from her partner , the eccentric @entity9 film director @entity8 , best known for writing and directing romantic fantasy film @entity10			1
a spokesman for the couple tells me : ‘ @entity8 and @entity5 separated amicably earlier this year and have continued to be friends and co-parent their children			1
we would ask that you respect their privacy and that of their children during this time			2
the revelation comes after a slightly dishevelled @entity5 was seen leaving a party last week ( right ) without her husband struggling : @entity5 appeared to be a touch worse for wear in the early hours of friday the revelation comes after a slightly dishevelled @entity5 was seen leaving a party last week without her husband			2
there were signs their relationship was in trouble last year , when @entity8 , 56 , was pictured embracing a mystery blonde , thought to be one of his assistants , near his home in @entity40			1
at the time the couple refused to comment			2
recently , though , the stress has clearly proved too much to bear , as evidenced by @entity44 ’s appearance last week			2
but it is not the first time concern has been raised about her wellbeing			0
a strange situation ? : in september 2013 @entity8 was allegedly caught with a blonde lady after a dinner date in @entity52 ; @entity53 later said the report was ' nonsense ' ‘ @entity44 was very upset at the @entity57 party earlier this month hosted by @entity58 , ’ says a friend			1
‘ other guests noticed she was in a bad way			0
it ’s all still very raw and they only told the children two weeks ago			2
’ another friend says : ‘ @entity8 is having a classic mid-life crisis			1
all @entity44 ’s friends think he ’s a terrible old cliche			0
@entity44 gave him a lot of time to sort himself out			0
’ the self - confessed ‘ bonkers couple ’ famously do not share a home , instead living next door to each other in north @entity52 with their children , @entity73 , ten , and @entity74 , six			1
‘ the houses are joined , ’ @entity5 has explained			2
‘ he always visits , which is really touching			0
he ’s always coming over			0
journalists think there ’s an underground tunnel , gothic			0
it ’s actually quite above ground , lots of light			0
’ she admitted , however , they only share a bed ‘ sometimes ’ because of ‘ a snoring issue ’			0
‘ i talk , he snores			0
the other thing is , he ’s an insomniac , so he needs to watch television to get to sleep			0
’ the couple have collaborated on more than seven films since they met on the set of 2001 ’s @entity100 , which @entity8 directed			1
‘ you were the first person i thought of to play a chimpanzee , ’ he told her at the time			0
often described as his ‘ muse ’ , @entity5 , 48 , went on to star in his films @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			2
in that time she morphed from a self - described ‘ corset bimbo ’ into playing darker roles			2
she is currently reprising her role as the @entity113 in @entity108 : through the @entity114 , which @entity8 is producing			1
once she got together with the scruffy @entity8 her public image was transformed and she became increasingly renowned for her bizarre dress sense			1
‘ i feel like i have a reputation to keep , ’ @entity5 once said of her outlandish outfits			0
‘ i have a responsibility now to dress badly – so it ’s kind of liberating			0
’ working with her partner , however , took its toll			0
‘ it ’s not without its pressures , working with @entity8 , ’ she said in 2010 following their work on the first @entity108 film , which @entity8 also directed			1
it 's over : @entity5 and @entity8 , pictured in february 2013 , have split after 13 years together , her rep confirmed to people on tuesday last time they were seen together : @entity53 photobombed @entity8 when he was posing with @entity135 backstage at @entity136 on saturday ‘ it worked on @entity138 was very stressful , very hard on our relationship			1
he ’s a partner in our private life , but when he ’s directing , he ’s the boss			0
and maybe i confuse that			0
’ in 2005 @entity5 , great - granddaughter of @entity144 prime minister @entity143 , also described the director as being on the autistic spectrum			1
‘ @entity8 will kill me , but while making this drama i realised he has a bit of @entity149 ’s in him , you start recognising the signs			1
we were watching a documentary about autism and he said that was how he felt as a child			0
’ with their children : together the former power couple have an 11 - year - old son @entity159 and daughter @entity74 , aged seven ; here they are all pictured in november at @entity52 's @entity162 cutting a lonely figure : the critically acclaimed actress in bulky attire on friday in @entity52 when she was @entity167 shopping happier days : the twosome - he 's 56 and she 's 48 - embracing in 2010 at the @entity171 in @entity52 it is perhaps telling that @entity8 has just released his first directorial live - action feature in 13 years that does n’t star the actress			1
@entity175 , which is out this week , instead has @entity176 in the lead role			0
@entity8 was previously married to @entity179 - born artist @entity178 for four years although the couple separated in 1991 when he moved in with model and actress @entity182			1
before @entity8 , @entity5 embarked on a relationship with sir @entity184 while he was still married to @entity185 after co-starring with him in 1994 film @entity186			2
the couple separated in 1999			2
they were professionally reunited earlier this year after he directed her in the @entity191 film @entity189 , in which she plays the fairy godmother			1
in the early hours of friday morning @entity5 was seen leaving @entity195 man @entity194 ’s @entity167 – apparently a little worse for wear – alongside @entity197 and his wife			0
however , she and @entity8 spent saturday together , attending a production of @entity136 in the @entity200			1
the @entity201 last year claimed the couple had a combined wealth of £ 80million more of a collaborative one for @entity8 : in 2005 's @entity106 , the @entity205 beauty worked with @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 she gave it her all : the critically acclaimed actress dove into her role for the 2007 film @entity107 ; later @entity8 would say this film was hard on their relationship a scar look for her : @entity53 as @entity219 in @entity8 's @entity108 in 2010 another gem : in 2012 @entity44 co-starred with @entity221 in @entity8 's drama @entity109			1
