@entity1 terrorist @entity0 may be using a body double in a bid to fool military drones , according to new analysis of the video showing the murder of @entity9 officers and pilots and the decapitated head of @entity12			1
it also appears to suggest that @entity12 fought his captors before he was beheaded			1
in a horrifying video of the mass murder of @entity9 soldiers and the @entity19 aid worker , @entity0 appears with his face hidden , as usual - but analysts have discovered a single frame in which another man , visible for less than half a second , can been seen wearing a balaclava			1
@entity25 @entity1 terrorist @entity0 ( right ) may be using a body double in a bid to fool military drones , according to new analysis of the video showing the murder of @entity12 ( left ) they have speculated that he could be a decoy being used by @entity1 to lure drones away from @entity0			1
@entity34 , editorial director with the @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , which studied the video for over a week with @entity38 , the @entity25 anti-extremist think - tank , told @entity40 : ‘ it could be a body double or a decoy			1
i 'm not trying to say i know the answer , but his shape and size are very similar			2
’ a spokesman for @entity38 told @entity47 that the other figure may also be someone other than @entity0 , who is leading the slaughter			2
the teams examining the footage also discovered a large bruise above mr @entity12 ’s left eye , which may have resulted from a struggle with the fanatics before he was killed			1
the fact that he was not shown reading a scripted message out is also evidence that he was defiant to the last			2
it could be that he knew his execution was coming and denied his captors the satisfaction of repeating their words on camera			2
lasting 15 minutes and 53 seconds , the video – titled ‘ although the disbelievers dislike it ’ – starts with a documentary - style history of @entity73 since the invasion of @entity75 by western allies in 2003			2
there are scenes of bombings , summary executions and graphic video footage of dead civilians lying in the streets			1
it also shows what appears to be a dead child lying on a bed covered in blood			1
in the next clip , filmed in the desert , the self - declared murderer known as @entity0 is seen leading a line of @entity9 troops to their deaths			1
a few paces behind him – and in the middle of a 16 - strong line of @entity100 jihadists said to be from over six countries - is the man believed to be @entity103 unsettling : the video also shows the mass murder of @entity9 military personnel by beheading led by @entity0 at a desert location			1
unlike the murder of @entity111 hostages , the killing of the @entity9 is shown in full bloodthirsty : the video shows in full graphic detail how the militants saw the heads off their victims @entity118 , a 20 - year - old from @entity119			1
like the other jihadists he is unmasked			0
@entity0 however keeps to his habit of showing only his eyes			0
@entity118 clutches the scruff of the neck of a @entity9 soldier , whose hands are bound with plastic ties			1
but while the other militants have expressionless faces – this young bearded man looks menacingly into the distance			2
taking the lead from @entity0 and those in the line before him , he brandishes a military knife taken from a box of weapons			0
the chilling sound of a blade being drawn can be heard above the sound of @entity142 music in the background			0
the prisoners are not wearing @entity146 - style orange jumpsuits , as in previous videos , but are dressed in black trousers and shirts			0
humanitarian : @entity12 , the 26 - year - old former @entity151 , was committed to aid work @entity0 , who has leather shoulder holsters for hand guns and a balaclava - style mask , takes centre stage			1
his appearance would seem to confirm his seniority and status as ‘ chief executioner ’ of @entity73			0
the man thought to be @entity118 stands to his right			2
@entity0 delivers his message to @entity19 and @entity25 before an eerie silence during which the camera zooms in on the faces of the killers , who remain impassive throughout			1
the scene then focuses on @entity0 – who begins to cut his prisoner ’s neck – quelling suspicion that he himself did not actually perform the previous beheadings			0
unlike the apparent murders of @entity111 hostages , in which the camera cuts away at the moment their throats are cut , the killings of the soldiers are shown in full			0
the camera zooms in on @entity0 and his victim who , in his final agonising moments , closes his eyes			0
@entity0 then looks threateningly into the camera while still holding the knife			0
the next clip shows a knife slicing into the necks of @entity9 soldiers followed by a stream of blood that turns the sand red			1
the image after that shows the soldiers ’ heads on top of their bent - over bodies			2
the mass beheading is a new departure because previous mass executions have been undertaken using guns			1
the fact that @entity0 ’s accomplices revealed their identities suggests they have no intention of returning to their home countries			0
a caption refers to them as ‘ hungry lions whose drink is blood and play is carnage ’			0
family and friends of mr @entity12 were joined by politicians and prominent figures in the @entity222 at a memorial service sunday			0
the former @entity224 , who was 26 at the time of his death , was remembered for his commitment to aid work at @entity229 two days after his funeral services			2
' we 're not here because of how he passed , ' said @entity233 , executive director @entity234 in @entity236			0
' we 're because of how he lived			0
we 're here because of the type of man he chose to be			2
we 're here because of his selflessness			0
' @entity12 landed in the hands of @entity244 extremists last year while delivering aid to @entity9 caught in the crossfire of a ghastly civil war			1
at the time he was working as part of @entity249 and @entity250 , or @entity251 , a relief organization he founded in 2012 and which suspended operations after his kidnapping			0
his parents learned of his capture last year , though the information was not made public at the time			0
when @entity12 appeared in a beheading video of a @entity25 aid worker , his parents recorded a video pleading for his release to @entity244 militants			1
@entity12 , who converted to @entity142 and changed his name from @entity264 during his time in captivity , inspired the @entity222 community to come to his family 's side			0
@entity270 is pictured while working as an aid worker in @entity9 before his capture			1
his murder is not actually shown in the latest film and he does not deliver a final message as other hostages have			0
