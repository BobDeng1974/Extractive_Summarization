by mail online reporter as the former foreign secretary he was used to meeting and negotiating with political leaders from around the world			1
but @entity6 found himself with an even trickier engagement when he bumped into a hen party at a sausage and beer festival			1
thankfully , as this picture shows , mr @entity6 emerged smiling - despite showing some confusion about the l - plate symbols worn by the hens			1
former foreign secretary found himself with a tricky engagement when he bumped into a hen party at a sausage and beer festival in @entity20 , @entity21 - but appeared to fit in well mr @entity6 , who in recent months has been seen campaigning with the movie star @entity23 , was presenting awards at the @entity25 in @entity20 , @entity21 , on saturday when the unusual meeting took place			1
the hen party , who were celebrating with bride - to - be @entity30 , were glamping in the area when they approached the unsuspecting @entity33 politician for a photograph			2
afterwards some of her @entity36 friends joked about him being mistaken him for a stripper			0
@entity41 , a member of the hen party , said : ' we were just sat on the grass at the place we were staying and we heard that there was this sausage and beer festival and then the next thing , @entity6 is there presenting awards			1
' he was very nice			0
he was asking questions about the wedding and things and complimented us on the flowers in our hair			0
' ms @entity41 revealed that mr @entity6 was not aware of the reasons for the l - plates sported by the hen party and needed an explanation			1
in a more comfortable setting : mr @entity6 at the @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 , with @entity66 ( left ) and @entity67 @entity6 ( right ) and @entity68 actress @entity23 ( left ) at the @entity69 to end sexual violence in @entity71 in @entity65 in june ' it was funny because we had to explain why we had the l - plates on			2
he did n't understand it , ' she added			0
it 's been suggested that the tradition for l - plates arose because soon - to - be - hitched virgin brides would have to learn their way around the bedroom pretty quickly if they planned to keep their new husband			0
but a more popular line of reasoning is that a bride - to - be is , by definition , not married yet , making her a bit of a ' learner ' as far as marriage is concerned - just like a inexperienced driver who 's yet to pass their driving test			0
mr @entity6 quit as foreign secretary and became leader of the @entity96 in a @entity98 reshuffle earlier this month			1
he will leave @entity99 at the 2015 general election after 26 years as mp for @entity102 , @entity21			2
after the announcement , prime minister @entity103 said : ' @entity6 has been one of the leading lights of the @entity33 for a generation , leading the party and serving in two cabinets			0
' not only has he been a first - class foreign secretary - he has also been a close confidant , a wise counsellor and a great friend			2
' he will remain as first secretary of state and my de facto political deputy in the run up to the election - and it is great to know that he will be a core part of the team working to ensure an outright @entity33 victory			0
