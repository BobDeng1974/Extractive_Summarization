hearts were the source of all of @entity3 ’s childhood dreams			1
the chance to play , captain and manage the club ensured that , for long enough , the love affair was requited			1
a year ago , though , a long - standing relationship hit the buffers with a rather dull thud			1
widely acclaimed for the way he led the club throughout administration and a season of near - certain relegation , the 39 - year - old awoke one day having to digest one of the game ’s great truths : no one is indispensable			1
@entity3 is currently manager at @entity20 after leaving his post at @entity22 last year @entity3 chats with @entity23 last season brutally axed as @entity25 and @entity26 made way for @entity28 , @entity3 licked his wounds before returning to @entity20 , initially as assistant manager to @entity31			1
what ’s transpired since the parting of the ways has been utterly intriguing for both parties			2
@entity28 ’s side romped to the @entity37 with seven games to spare to mute anyone still clinging to the notion that they were wrong to dispense with @entity3 ’s services			1
yet , in only losing one of seven games since taking the reins from @entity46 last month at @entity47 , @entity3 , in turn , has underscored his dug - out credentials and then some			1
would @entity0 have won the @entity50 title with him still at the helm ? we shall never know			1
but , as he puts the finishing touches to a new long - term deal in @entity59 this week , the growing feeling among observers is that his former employers were perhaps both right and wrong			1
‘ i do n’t think i have proven a point to @entity0 , ’ @entity3 insisted			1
‘ i did n’t feel i had anything to prove			2
i did a good job there			2
‘ it is like any football club			1
when new people come in , if they have their own ideas and want to change things then that is what they will do			0
‘ i am delighted to see them coming straight back up - they have some cracking young players there and it is great to see them do so well			2
‘ but my focus now is @entity20			1
all i want is the best for them			0
hopefully , we can finish the season strongly			2
’ privately for @entity3 , the irony of what ’s gone on at @entity85 over the past year or so wo n’t be so much painful as excruciating			1
@entity3 insists his focus is on @entity20 and wants to end the season strongly in the @entity88 last season , boxed in by administration and a transfer embargo , he played the kids			1
fledglings like @entity94 and @entity95 featured in sides that were routinely thrashed			0
some feared for the psychological impact it would have on them but @entity3 knew what he was doing			1
to say the experience has stood them in good stead is a huge understatement			0
supported by a string of more experienced campaigners , those little boys lost have flourished under @entity28 ’s tutelage			0
might it be said that the club which binned @entity3 now owe him a huge debt of thanks ? ‘ you probably have to ask people at @entity0 , ’ he added			1
‘ i think the young lads certainly learned the hard way			0
a lot of them had to play when they probably were not ready			0
‘ i think that certainly set them up for this season and full credit to them			2
they have had a fantastic season , they have played some great stuff and scored lots of goals			2
‘ yes , i ’ve been in touch with couple of them			0
they did n’t thank me and i did n’t want them to			0
‘ i ’m just glad to see them doing very well because i knew they all had fantastic potential			0
‘ it ’s good to see them all fulfilling it			0
’ a consummate professional all his days , @entity3 ’s dedication to @entity20 is now absolute			1
and yet , when the prospect of returning to @entity85 next term is put to him , the broad grin on his face says it all			0
@entity3 says he is happy to see the youngsters come through in @entity144 after working with them last year ‘ it will be strange going back , ’ he conceded			1
‘ i went back as a @entity20 player and all i want now is for @entity20 to win games			1
‘ you ’ve got to be professional			0
i was very fortunate in life in that the team i grew up supporting , i managed to play for , captain and manage			0
‘ there ’s not a lot of people who can say that			0
‘ but my only focus now is @entity20			1
i ’m employed here and i want to very best for them			0
’ be that as it may , does what happened in @entity162 getting on a year ago still rankle with him ? ‘ not at all			2
it ’s football , ’ @entity3 insisted			1
‘ one of my best mates in the game , @entity164 , is at @entity167			0
you see the job he ’s done there with @entity171 yet they are leaving at the end of the season			2
‘ it ’s a game that ’s great to be involved in but it can be tough , as well			0
i ’m not the type of person that feels sorry for myself			0
you ’ve got to take these things on the chin and move forward			0
fortunately for me , i got a great opportunity back here and hopefully i can take it			0
’ that new contract should be inked by the end of this week and then the building for the future can start in earnest			0
the 39 - year - old manager admits it will be strange facing his former club @entity0 next season finally , without the yokes of administration and the intentions of new owners , @entity3 is relishing the chance to lead the @entity47 side unhindered			1
diplomacy prevented him talking openly of his desire to see @entity201 assume a playing / coaching role next term but it ’s evidently part of @entity3 ’s plans			1
‘ obviously i played with @entity201 , he ’s a friend of mine and possibly because i was sitting beside him at @entity207 on saturday , someone saw me , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’s very much a @entity208 player and his focus is obviously trying to get @entity208 back in the top flight			0
‘ it ’s not for me to speculate on other team ’s players as they have a lot of big games ahead			0
‘ it would n’t be right of me to comment on @entity201			0
i ’m not sure how many goals he has scored this season but he has still contributed eight or nine goals			2
‘ if we had a striker contributing that , we might be in the top six			0
i know @entity223 well and i ’m pretty sure that wherever he ends up next season , he will score goals because that ’s what he does			2
’ the prospect of @entity201 returning to @entity20 for a third spell will gladden the hearts of the @entity47 faithful			1
the striker may have endured a poor season second time around at @entity208 but , at 31 , still has the capacity to ensure a return to his first club is a successful one			1
for @entity3 , too , @entity47 has largely been a very happy second home			1
for all his strong @entity85 links , it was in @entity59 that he spent seven years as a player			0
and , after being cut - adrift by @entity0 last summer , it was @entity20 that offered him a way back into the game			1
you sense that ’s something that will never be forgotten			0
@entity3 was speaking at a @entity246 at @entity47 ‘ i played at @entity20 for seven years and i know what they are capable of , ’ he added			1
‘ the facilities here are fantastic			0
i spend a lot of time down here and i see what the club is doing in the local community			2
‘ there are kids here every single night of the week , which is fantastic to see			0
‘ when i played here there were a lot of @entity262 and @entity208 strips about the town and now there are lots of @entity20 ones so that ’s encouraging in terms of the future			1
‘ hopefully , we can see a lot of these younger kids coming through like we do at the moment - we have eight academy players in the first team which is great			2
‘ the club is moving forward in the right direction and hopefully it can keep moving forward			2
’ @entity3 was speaking at a @entity246 at @entity47			1
over 700 children from 16 schools are expected to be involved in this year ’s programme across @entity59 .			2

@entity3 was let go by @entity0 last season and is now at @entity20
39 - year - old says it will be odd facing former club in @entity88
