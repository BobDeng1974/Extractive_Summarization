too old for @entity19 ? @entity2 ( left ) , whose book @entity6 was the basis for @entity13 's hit series and two films , believes @entity16 creations exhausted @entity4 's character ' realistically , a middle - aged woman who was married without children would be much more focused on her career and less focused on this @entity36 : “ does he love me ? ” ... “ does he still not love me ? ” i mean , i think it was coming to the end of what they could do with the character			1
' the critically acclaimed author both dismissed the notion of a third movie , which ms @entity4 said she was open to in 2011 , and admitted she would have changed the plot entirely for the 2010 - released second film - where @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity19 jet off to @entity52 for a holiday			1
' if it were up to me , ' ms @entity2 said , ' the second movie would have been @entity19 decides to run for mayor and @entity48 helps her			1
' it would get into some real issues of what happens when you ’re part of a relationship and the woman is ambitious			1
what does that do to her relationship with @entity36 ? to me , that would be interesting			1
but they were not going to go there , ' she said			2
' in real life , it does n’t seem realistic to me that character would be writing that column for 15 years			2
it does n’t make sense ! to me			2
' but people love the character , and i think they felt they were doing the movies for fans , and they just wanted to give fans what they wanted			2
or what they thought the fans wanted			2
' she also discusses her firm belief that @entity19 would never have ended up with @entity36 in real life			2
@entity6 : ms @entity2 's nineties @entity88 column , @entity6 , became the inspiration for her subsequent book , and the @entity13 television series romantic ideal : ms @entity2 also discussed her firm belief that @entity19 would never have ended up with @entity36 in real life ' in real life , i do n’t think women end up with that character , and if they do , they usually get divorced after a year , ' she explained			1
' he could n’t commit			2
i think the character @entity19 and @entity36 , it became in the audiences ’ mind a very romantic story			2
' @entity19 returned to television in january for a @entity6 prequel set in 1984 - this time the character is 16 - year - old virgin in high school - played by @entity108			1
the @entity109 , which was based on ms @entity2 's 2010 young - adult novel of the same title , was expected to be a hit for the @entity113			1
but with its first season almost over , @entity114 has seen disappointing ratings , with each episode drawing an average of 1.5million viewers , according to @entity120			1
ms @entity2 , whose nineties @entity88 column , @entity6 , became the inspiration for her subsequent book , and the television series , hopes that it will be renewed for a second series			2
' there ’s so much that can happen , ' she says			0
she just holds the screen			0
she ’s a very cool girl in person			0
i think that comes through			0
that ’s something that ’s key to @entity19			0
@entity19 has to be cool			0
' as for why it has so far recieved poor ratings , ms @entity2 offered : ' the reality is , monday night is an incredibly difficult night on tv			1
we were up against the bachelor , which had the highest ratings it ’s had in years			1
the @entity109 : @entity19 returned to television in january for a @entity6 prequel set in 1984 - this time the character is 16 - year - old virgin in high school - played by @entity108 ratings flop : the @entity109 , which was based on ms @entity2 's 2010 young - adult novel of the same title , was expected to be a hit for the @entity113 no second season ? with its first season almost over , @entity114 has seen disappointing ratings , with each episode drawing an average of 1.5million viewers , according to @entity120 ' those kinds of reality shows are like a sporting event			1
but the @entity109 has huge streaming numbers			1
i do n’t know if they told you that			0
' ms @entity2 also touched on her original column for the @entity88 , which she says was about ' sexual mores , mating and dating rituals in the city , [ and ] cultural anthropology			0
' she explained : ' it tapped into this idea of single women in their 30s			0
in the 1990s there was an explosion of single women			0
these were women who had come to the city in the 1980s , as part of “ the working girl			0
” the ’ 80s was all about this idea that women could have it all			0
' you could have a career , and you could have a husband , and you could have children			0
then all of a sudden , you had the 1990s , you had all these women in their 30s who had the careers but had not managed to find a husband , and they were single			0
and there really was no model for how to live your life and even what this life was			0
' it was a lifestyle where women were very reliant on girlfriends , and it was this idea that when you come to the city , you make a new family			0
' that ’s what @entity6 was really about			0
and now , as time goes on , the idea of women delaying marriage , having careers , has become in a sense mainstream			0
so for young women , it ’s a passage in their life that they relate to			0
