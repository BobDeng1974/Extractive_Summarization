he said : ' is this the shortest cycle lane in the @entity41 ? ' i have no idea how long it has been there but a new mini roundabout has recently been located in @entity63 , so it may be that they had some paint left over			1
' this cycle lane in @entity82 , @entity83 , is only 13 feet long			1
it was painted in april this year by @entity85 but has already been slammed by the town 's cycling community the bike lane on @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity88 was created in december 2012 and is just 8ft 2ins , barely longer than a bike			0
it was defended by @entity91 council as they said it did not cost them anything one cycle lane in @entity1 is only six feet long , pictured , and is believed to be @entity41 ' shortest other weird cycle lanes include this one , pictured , in @entity83 which is just 13 feet long meanwhile , this one in @entity91 , @entity88 , pictured , was ridiculed by cyclists when it was unveiled this bike lane on @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity88 , was ridiculed by the town 's cyclists when it was built in 2012 @entity105 said the cycle lane , situated on a junction between @entity63 and @entity64 , had nothing to do with them			1

' in the planning application for the development , there is an agreement to provide for safety at road junctions			0
' the cycle lane was created by developer @entity123 , who inserted the lane when completing a nearby housing estate as cyclists join the road from a shared pavement			1

the 13 foot cycle lane in @entity82 in @entity83 was developed in april this year and @entity85 county council bosses said it offered a useful link in a much longer bike route in the town			2
but users said officials could have saved themselves the bother of marking its start and finish with painted signs – which are squeezed in next to each other on the small patch of pavement .			0

@entity199 moved the cycle lane onto the pavement
the cycle lane allows riders to pedal the opposite way to *oncoming* traffic
the *original* cycle lane was on the road which has been narrowed for work
the wonky cycle lane is one of the most unusual in @entity41
