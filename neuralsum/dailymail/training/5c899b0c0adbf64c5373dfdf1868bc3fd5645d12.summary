by @entity1 reporter published : 06:15 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 08:34 est , 3 october 2012 fascinating maps have emerged that show the evolution of the @entity5 from the early chaotic diagrams to the modern , familiar ones commuters use today			1
they are an incredible record not only of the expanding tube system beneath the capital ’s streets , but also the transformation in how the railway was depicted			1
the maps , all duplicates produced at the same time as the originals , will go on sale in @entity5 this week and are expected to fetch thousands of pounds per item			1
look familiar ? this map , dated from as far back as 1919 bares little resemblance to the modern day @entity5 maps leaps and bounds : seven years later , in 1926 , this map by @entity26 has changed drastically from its 1919 counterpart the major change came to the mapping of the network in 1933 when engineer @entity31 drew his own map as a diagrammatic representation of the subterranean system			1
he cleverly realised that commuters did not need to know the exact route the trains took , just the order of the stops			0
this is the one we are familiar with today and was what inspired underground network maps across the world			1
the examples coming up for sale tomorrow are duplicates owned by the @entity48			2
the @entity5 maps begin in 1919 with one titled “ @entity50 including the @entity51 ( @entity52 ) section ”			1
this uses just two colours - red and black - to show the lines of the railway and their true , meandering routes			0
a 1926 version shows the tubes on the same map as the @entity61 and the road network , and the colour yellow has been added to one @entity64 in the 1920s @entity65 were fascinated by the cartography depicting the city as is shown by a quirky map from 1928			2
on it , the tube is superimposed on an 18th century map of the capital			2
ever evolving : this 1928 map by @entity74 is expected to sell for more than £ 2,000 and has reverted to a more familiar colour scheme all ways to @entity77 : this curiously titled map by @entity79 was produced in 1932 and even has pictures of boats on the @entity61 revert to type : @entity74 was back on the case in 1933 , developing a similar map to his 1928 version a @entity87 couplet at the bottom of the @entity89 upon the 1761 map states : ' this old map of @entity5 teaches you how many underground roads there are today			1
' then in 1933 mr @entity31 came up with his version that he completed in his own time and initially his @entity5 bosses were sceptical			1
@entity98 from @entity99 ’s , which is selling the maps , said : “ the @entity102 has a big archive and is selling some of its duplicate posters			0
' this is to raise money for new acquisitions and conserve its existing stock			0
' among the collection are a series of @entity5 maps and through them you can see the network growing and growing			1
' at first the maps followed the actual routes the trains took and they became more complicated as more track was laid			0
' then in 1933 @entity31 revolutionised the process by coming up with the diagrammatic representation of the @entity5			1
iconic : @entity31 's 1933 map is remarkably similar to the version commuters use today a similar shape : this 1934 @entity5 map , titled @entity125 , started to take on a recognisable form getting there : @entity31 's maps were a revolution after he came up with the diagrammatic representation that is used as today 's model			1
the above was produced in 1937 ' the different colours were already being used but his map is the one we are now familiar with			0
' @entity31 was an engineer and draughtsman who worked on the @entity5 but at first his bosses were sceptical about the idea			1
' but it clearly worked and influenced underground maps around the world			2
' the collection is also interesting because some of the maps include proposed routes that were never completed , such as a line to @entity146			0
' there is lots of cross appeal for these posters which were printed on surprisingly thin paper			0
' they were made to be put up on the @entity5 , but were clearly expected to be replaced regularly			2
' the maps go through to the early 1940s when the @entity5 was utilised by @entity65 escaping the @entity154			2
they are expected to sell for several thousand pounds each at the sale in @entity5			1
astounding : @entity31 's 1938 version looks a far cry from the earlier ones still going : ten years later , in 1948 , @entity31 produced this map which possesses a striking resemblance to the present day 's where we are now : today 's map looks extremely similar to those produced by @entity31 80 years ago as a solution to solve the problems of increased traffic congestion , the 1855 @entity165 was passed giving a green light to the construction of an underground rail network between @entity172 and @entity173 via @entity174			1
it was to be named the @entity176			0
the railway finally opened in 1863 and the following year the @entity178 opened			0
the underground railways rapidly expanded and eventually incorporated @entity180 on the @entity181 and @entity182 and @entity183 and @entity184 on the @entity185			0
the @entity186 expanded into the north - east of the city , creating a new suburb dubbed ‘ @entity193 ’ in the process which included @entity191 , @entity51 and @entity192			0
with the advancement of digging technologies , by the late 19th century the first tube lines were being created , and in 1890 the @entity198 and @entity197 , which now comprises of part of the @entity200 , was opened			0
in 1900 the @entity201 – now known as the @entity202 – was opened , which spanned from @entity203 to @entity205 ’s @entity204			0
three years later the various privately owned railways merged into a @entity207 , known as @entity208			0
@entity31 also drew his first underground map in the current style in 1933			2
in 1948 , the @entity212 government – along with the four mainline railway companies – nationalised the ever - expanding network , becoming the @entity215 , which was eventually replaced by @entity216 in 2000 .			2

incredible records of @entity5 's expanding underground network has emerged , spanning from 1919 maps to @entity31 's iconic *designs*
maps to go on sale in the capital and are expected to fetch several thousands of pounds per piece
