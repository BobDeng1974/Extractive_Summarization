@entity0 today named the squad he hopes can deliver glory for @entity3 on home soil and had a sharp response for @entity7 boss @entity6 in the process			1
the @entity3 manager included six @entity11 - based players in his 23 - man panel but could n't find room for @entity15 pair @entity14 and @entity16 , the duo among a host of big @entity19 names to miss out			1
with an astonishing 17 @entity21 rookies in his panel , @entity0 , a @entity21 winner with his country in 2002 , opted against bringing along out - of - favour tournament veterans like @entity27 or @entity28 back into the fold			1
midfield : @entity67 ( @entity7 ) , @entity62 ( @entity63 ) , @entity64 ( @entity7 ) , @entity66 ( @entity65 ) , @entity59 ( @entity7 ) , @entity60 ( @entity61 ) , @entity58 ( @entity57 )			0
attackers : @entity72 ( @entity73 ) , @entity30 ( @entity43 ) , @entity74 ( @entity75 ) , @entity70 ( @entity71 ) , @entity69 ( @entity41 )			0
advantage : @entity3 are favourites to win the @entity21 on home soil this summer calm before the storm : @entity0 before announcing his 23 - man squad for the @entity21 in @entity3 and the one - time @entity7 manager insisted he paid little attention to @entity6 's recent comments raising concerns over the form of star midfielder @entity67 , when he claimed the @entity87 was ' our best player to december ... but arrived in the crucial moment of the season in a low '			1
' no it does n't concern me at all , ' responded @entity0			1
' @entity67 is one of the best players we have in the world , regardless of any comments from any coach			2
' he may have some physical issues			0
through the physical exams we have at the start we 'll be sure to get them right			0
i have no worries about @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity52 whoever			0
' @entity0 sprung a surprise in selecting @entity55 's @entity54 and @entity48 full back @entity53 among his reserve defenders along with the veteran @entity45 , spurning the chance to call upon the red - hot @entity111 pair of @entity112 and @entity113			1
big occasion : the announcement took place in front of nearly 800 journalists in @entity119 @entity14 and @entity16 , equally , were left on the shelf along with @entity65 midfielder @entity121 as @entity57 's excellent @entity58 claimed the final midfield slot			1
while there may have been some question marks about the make - up of the wider squad , @entity0 's starting eleven , and his 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation , is all but cemented in place			1
the defence of @entity31 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity52 in front of veteran @entity35 is a staple			0
in front of them @entity66 and @entity61 's teak - tough @entity60 will protect the attacking trio of @entity30 , @entity67 in the middle and @entity70 on the right with @entity0 's favoured son , @entity74 , leading the line			1
fit and in form , it 's a truly formidable machine , as they proved on the way to last summer 's @entity143 , dismantling @entity144 in a manner the @entity21 and @entity19 champions had n't known in the final			2
but worries over both form and fitness persist			0
allowing for rookie - season struggles , @entity30 's form since the turn of the year and the furore over his transfer rocked @entity43 has been pretty wretched			1
@entity6 rebuke or not , @entity67 has also struggled to orchestrate as devastatingly as he can as @entity7 tapered off in the second - half of the season			2
chosen ones : @entity3 's coach @entity0 has named his 23 - man squad for the tournament throw in @entity35 's jaunt to the @entity162 to pick up game time , @entity66 's drifting in and out of the @entity65 starting line - up and @entity52 finding himself on the @entity51 bench of late and there are undoubtedly headaches that @entity0 must hope dissipate in the next four weeks			1
of greatest concern however is the lack of big tournament experience amongst the squad			2
only six - @entity35 , @entity45 , @entity31 , @entity47 , @entity59 and @entity74 - have ever taken to a @entity21 field			2
with the pressure of delivering for a nation of 200 million diehards and the daunting prospect of a last 16 showdown against @entity144 , @entity179 or @entity180 , the rookie squad might just buckle			0
' the squad we had in 2002 was a lot more experienced			0
seventeen of our players have never played in @entity21 whereas that was maybe 10 back in 2002 , ' said @entity0			1
the big one : the @entity21 begins in @entity3 on june 12 , finishing on july 13 with the final weight on your shoulders : @entity3 will be under huge pressure to lift the trophy on july 13 in @entity119 ' but they have experience of playing strong competitions in @entity196 , @entity197			1
we know that that can make a difference in certain games			0
' we are going to call on some world champions and some great players who will come in and spend time with us and help us in these challenges			0
i will go all the way to hell with these players if they need it			0
' @entity0 will be hoping he does n't have to go that far			2
the heavenly prospect of delivering a @entity21 on home soil is a whole lot more palatable			0
