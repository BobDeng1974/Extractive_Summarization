police investigating the murder later bugged a canal barge and secretly taped another local villain @entity55 laughing about @entity10 and the victim saying : ' horrible little f * * * * * that @entity58 is			2
you know what i mean , cut his fingers off , cut his toes off , cut his ear off - anything but kill the guy			0

' @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity37 were later driven to the woods by @entity235 on october 30			1

' how do you lose a shotgun ? you do n’t lose a shotgun			0
someone said we should go back in the morning and look for it			0

@entity37 will never get that opportunity			2
in our eyes no sentence will ever be long enough			0
' @entity37 ’s death has ripped the heart out of our family and our lives will never be the same without him in them			2
