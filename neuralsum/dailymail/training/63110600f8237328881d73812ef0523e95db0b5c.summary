no other remains have been found			1

@entity101 , geneva @entity102 , 1 hour ago if i died my @entity104 would definitely eat me			2
i do n't think i would mind though @entity106 the rabbit , @entity108 , 11 hours ago they do not yet know how she died ; she may have simply died of natural causes and the animals scavenged her body			1
i hope this is the case			2
they would be unlikely to rehome the dogs if they suspected otherwise			2
sl in central ok , @entity119 , @entity120 , 18 hours ago i 'm surprised there are any remains left at all			1
when i had only cats i would n't have understood how even big , heavy bones like femurs are like chalk if a dog is determined to chew them up			1
will anyone be able to take these dogs ? if they 've lived their lives chained up and if they 're really half wolf , half dog , they are probably not fit for rehoming			2
it has nothing to do with having eaten the only food they could find			2
love the new comment system so far			2

@entity145 , @entity146 , @entity120 , 19 hours ago i 'd eat a person if i were trapped with no food			0
@entity152 , @entity153 , 19 hours ago well , that sucks for her			0
i personally know 2 wolf - dog hybrids that live in our neighborhood , and they are sweet , mellow , and very lovable			0
their 2 - legged parents are both university professors , and their wolfies are the most dignified and well behaved creatures i 've ever met			0
sorry this woman got eaten , but once you 're dead , cats will eat you much more quickly than any dog will			0
@entity169 , @entity170 , 20 hours ago with today 's science should be easy enough to prove			0
sad if true but , not the dogs fault			0
if they were starving ... remember the " @entity174 " ? @entity175 , germantown , @entity120 , 21 hours ago it 's a possibility			0
@entity177 , @entity120 , 21 hours ago any starving animal would have eaten her			0
it really is n't about them being wolf hybrids			1
they could have been labradoodles			0
it 's just survival instinct			0
@entity186 , @entity185 , 22 hours ago poor dogs			0
chained up or caged with nowhere to go			0
