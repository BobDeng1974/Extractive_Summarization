dr @entity0 says many obese people survive on a diet of pizza , fries , crisps , cakes and biscuits which leaves them obese - but undernourished the number of people who are malnourished despite being obese is scandalous , a leading weight loss surgeon has said today			1
a recent study showed despite high levels of obesity in the @entity16 , many people are undernourished			2
a diet of pizza , fries , crisps , pasta , rice , biscuits , cakes leaves many people consuming a lot of calories but few nutrients , says dr @entity0 , an @entity29 consultant specialising in weight loss and upper gastrointestinal surgery			1
the problem is exacerbated by coffee shops serving sugary and fatty drinks appearing in hospital foyers and junior doctors being given minimal training on nutrition			1
drug companies push the sales of expensive drugs which treat the symptoms of the disease but not the cause , she says			1
instead we should treat disease with nutrition , letting food be our medicine			1
here , she gives her view ... as a doctor , it never fails to astonish me how little training we are given in good , sound nutrition , and how little emphasis we place on the role of eating well in preventing and curing disease in @entity60 medicine			1
need proof ? just look at the dismal food we serve to our patients in many hospitals , or the sugar and fat - filled snacks we offer in our hospital foyers			2
look too at the multi-million pound drug industry that is encouraging us as doctors to treat type 2 diabetes , high cholesterol , heart disease and other conditions related to poor nutrition with expensive drugs rather than healthier food			1
@entity79 , the father of medicine , was so right when he said , over 2,000 years ago : ' let food be thy medicine '			2
and yet , fast - forward to the 21st century and a recent study of @entity16 shows that many @entity16 are undernourished			1
yes , you read that correctly – despite the @entity16 's high levels of obesity , much of its population is undernourished ! for example , only 11 per cent of people meet the daily recommended intake of fibre and only 5 per cent consume recommended amounts of potassium			1
a large majority also fall short on vitamins a , @entity98 , @entity99 , calcium and iron – instead eating more saturated fat , cholesterol and sodium than recommended			0
these stats are so frustrating to me as a doctor – and i suspect the @entity108 is no better			0
it may seem shocking that you can be both obese and undernourished , but perhaps it is n't so astonishing if you look at the nutrients in many of our regular snacks			0
malnutrition is a word we usually associate with the tragically thin figures from tv news reports of third world famines			0
in fact , it 's a shockingly common problem in @entity108			0
though not at starvation level , there are millions of patients who are n't getting sufficient calories , protein , vitamins and minerals			0
overweight people can still be malnourished if they eat foods giving enough energy but no nutrients doctors say our growing reliance on fast food , coupled with soaring rates of binge - drinking , means many are lacking the vitamins and minerals essential for health			2
the result , in the most extreme cases , is pot - bellies , wasted limbs and emaciated bodies - all conditions more usually associated with famine victims in the developing world			0
while malnutrition can be fatal , in more mild forms it can cause a host of symptoms that impact on every day life , from hair loss and muscle wastage to food cravings and lethargy			1
how many nutrients do you get in biscuits , pieces of cake , crisps , fries , pizza , white rice , pasta and bread ? not a whole lot			0
so , if we are eating these ' nutrient deficient ' foods regularly , we must make sure we are getting our nutrients from real , fresh , whole foods , too			0
every day i read of yet another study that demonstrates how the food we eat is contributing to our ill - health , rather than nourishing and fuelling our bodies , and how , if we only ate a more nutritious diet , we could reduce our risk of illness and even treat problems we have already			2
i could list hundreds of examples – but here are a few that really highlight the power of good nutrition : heart researchers showed that a heart - healthy eating plan rich in fruits , vegetables and fish significantly reduced the chance of a second heart attack and stroke in people with cardiovascular disease			1
diabetes another study from @entity210 showed that eating more whole fruits , particularly blueberries , grapes , and apples , was significantly associated with a lower risk of type - 2 diabetes			0
@entity217 various studies have linked a higher intake of omega 3 with improvements in mental health			0
stroke a @entity225 eating pattern supplemented with nuts can reduce your stroke risk according to the @entity230 's review of the literature			0
cancer over 25 studies have shown that eating plenty of fibre reduces the risk of bowel cancer			2
all bad news ? not so			0
firstly , what i 've highlighted above actually gives the power back to the individual , away from the doctor			0
you can treat yourself and the prescription is simple – real , fresh , honest , unprocessed food in sensible portions			2
how great is that ? these studies demonstrate that not only can you improve existing conditions ( it 's never too late ! ) , but can also take great measures to prevent future illness – just by what you put in your shopping basket this week ! @entity256 , the genius who invented the light - bulb , had another ' lightbulb ' moment when he said this : ' the doctor of the future will no longer treat the human frame with drugs , but rather will cure and prevent disease with nutrition '			1
that was around 100 years ago … it 's about time we took his advice ! dr @entity0 says changing a person 's diet to prevent illness is not ' bad news ' - instead it gives the power back to the individual , allowing them to improve existing conditions and prevent future illness			1

research shows many obese people are suffering from malnutrition
only 11 **%** of people in @entity16 get enough fibre and 5 **%** get enough potassium
dr @entity0 , an @entity29 weight - loss consultant , says this is a scandal
*western* medicine should place a greater emphasis on good nutrition
problem exacerbated by poor hospital food and little training on nutrition
drug companies pushing expensive drugs which only treat symptoms
studies show a better diet can prevent a whole host of diseases
we should ' let food be our medicine ' dr @entity311 argues
