by @entity0 for @entity1 last year snapchat famously turned down a £ 1.8 billion offer from @entity3 - a decision that left many stunned considering the company was - and is - yet to make any serious revenue			1
but the move seems to have paid off , as @entity10 ’s owners are set to become billionaires with reports that the company is now valued at £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion )			1
in a recent round of funding , investors promised millions to the company in a move that sees the company jump significantly in value within less than a year			1
the @entity22 - based owners of @entity10 ( @entity23 left , @entity24 right ) are set to become billionaires following reports that investors have promised the company millions			1
and the latest funding gives the company a valuation of £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion ) venture capital firm @entity31 & @entity32 has agreed to invest in the fast - growing messaging startup @entity10 at a valuation close to £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion ) , reports the @entity35			1
@entity36 has launched a new ephemeral messaging app called @entity38			0
the app , which functions in a similar way to @entity10 , allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend			1
like @entity10 , the user can tap on a friend 's face to instantly send a photo , or hold their finger down to send a video			2
however , @entity38 only allows you to send messages to one person at a time , which makes it frustrating if you ’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends			0
the favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends , though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total			0
@entity38 is currently only available in @entity68 , @entity69 , and @entity70			0
the venture - capital firm had committed to invest up to £ 12 million ( $ 20 million ) in @entity10 in may , the @entity35 cited one source as saying			2
and apparently at least one other strategic investor has committed to joining the latest round of funding			2
if the deal goes through , @entity10 would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion ) or more , including car - ride service uber and rooms - to - let startup @entity83			1
@entity10 lets users send photo - messages that vanish within seconds , but is expected to soon begin offering advertising or branch out into additional services			2
this may include the ability to send instant money transfers to other users			0
though @entity10 and other similar mobile messaging apps do n't have established business models yet , their rapid user growth and perceptions of advertising potential have aroused intense investor interest over the past year or so			0
the valuation put @entity10 ( @entity101 shown ) in an elite group of super-rich tech startups			1
more than 700 million snaps are sent a day but the company is yet to make any serious revenue			1
however it apparently has plans to monetise the app in future			2
this may include allowing people to transfer money to other users @entity10 is continuing to grow in popularity , with people sending more than 700 million disappearing messages a day			1
in june @entity3 launched a similar app called @entity119 in the hope of replicating @entity10 ’s success			0
the app allows consumers to exchange photos and videos , which will later disappear , without requiring @entity3 accounts			0
but despite its rapid growth , @entity10 has had a number of obstacles to contend with			0
the group this year settled charges with @entity134 regulators , which accused it of deceiving consumers by promising that photos sent on its service disappeared forever after a period of time			0
according to the @entity143 at the time , photos sent on @entity10 could , in fact , be saved by recipients using several methods , such as taking a screenshot .			0
