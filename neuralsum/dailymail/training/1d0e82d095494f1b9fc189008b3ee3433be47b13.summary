for two years , @entity1 the cat was nurtured and adored by owner @entity2			1
she had got him when he was just six weeks old and as well as knowing his every purr , she had come to think of him as her child			0
so imagine miss @entity2 ’s distress when she had to resort to defending herself against him – with a vacuum cleaner			0
still healing : @entity2 shows the wounds on her leg after her ' psychotic cat ' clawed at her skin it was all the decorator had to hand when @entity1 launched a vicious attack on her , transforming into a ‘ psychopath cat ’ in a split second and leaving his doting owner in hospital on a drip			1
the 35 - year - old had merely walked into her spare bedroom , where @entity1 spends a lot of time , when he leapt at her , sinking his teeth into her leg and clawing at her skin ‘ like a feline ninja ’			1
luckily miss @entity2 ’s mother , who lives with her in @entity30 , east @entity31 , was in their three - bedroom home and rushed upstairs to fight off the cat			1
the pair barricaded themselves in the room while @entity1 prowled the landing , and only plucked up courage to emerge half an hour later – armed with a vacuum cleaner			1
miss @entity2 then spent seven hours in @entity41 where she was x-rayed and given antibiotics through a drip , as well as a tetanus injection			1
attack mode : @entity1 the cat 's assault caught on camera			1
the ' psychotic ' moggie has now been neutered in the hope it will calm him down the wound on her leg is refusing to heal more than a week after the attack and she is waiting to see an orthopaedic consultant to find out if @entity1 has inflicted any long - term damage			1
a shocked miss @entity2 said @entity1 had always been as ‘ good as gold ’ before the attack			2
‘ i ’ve had him since he was six weeks old			0
i absolutely adore him and give him loads of affection			0
' i treated him like he was my kid			2
but when i walked into the spare room he was looking very odd , ’ she said			0
‘ his hair puffed up and his tail seemed far larger than normal			0
his facial expression changed and became menacing and he started making strange , aggressive noises , when he is normally quiet			0
‘ he pounced on me as my back was turned			2
i was terrified that my little cat who was so lovely had turned into a monster			2
’ vicious : @entity1 the cat is pictured during a calm moment after being fought off with a vacuum cleaner ( file picture ) miss @entity2 has since taken @entity1 to the vet to be neutered , which she hopes will help calm him down			1
she said : ‘ the vet thought it must have been a dog that attacked me			0
she said it was the worst injury caused by a cat she had ever seen			2
’ she added : ‘ the vet thought the problem might be territorial or behavioural			0
’ miss @entity2 has suffered flashbacks since the attack and has now decided to give @entity1 up to @entity88			1
‘ it ’s going to be for his best interests and mine , ’ she said .			0
