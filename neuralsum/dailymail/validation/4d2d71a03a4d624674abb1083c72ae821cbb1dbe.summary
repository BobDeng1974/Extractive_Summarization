when @entity1 spoke at the end of sunday ’s thumping defeat he seemed to be suggesting that it would still all somehow be ‘ alright on the night ’ for @entity5 at this @entity6			1
well , i ’m afraid it wo n’t be unless everyone involved , both players and management , have a good hard look at themselves			0
there needs to be a lot of hard , honest talking in that @entity5 camp over the next few days and a re-evaluation of how they are doing things because if they carry on like this they will not be involved in the @entity6 for much longer			2
@entity1 looks disappointed as he watches on during @entity5 's disastrous defeat by @entity23 the @entity5 players , led by their captain @entity1 , walk from the field in @entity27 after the match ' even when @entity5 put what looks like a challenging score on the board they are still brushed aside with contemptuous ease			1
not for the first time in this @entity6 they seemed like boys in the men ’s world of modern one - day cricket			1
' click here to read @entity40 's match report from @entity27 @entity5 now need to win their next five games if they are going to lift their first @entity6			1
when did they last win five one - day internationals on the trot ? it is going to be hard enough to win two in a row , let alone the next five			1
the whole tone was set with the sight of @entity49 walking out at three after @entity5 had got off to a really good start			1
now , it ’s not @entity53 ’s fault			0
he did not ask to be picked out of position and out of nick			0
but it just sent a message to @entity5 ’s players that they were going to prod their way through the middle overs and then have a go in the last 15			1
and it was a policy that brought @entity5 309 that in the old days would probably be enough			2
now it is nowhere near			0
@entity23 fans wave flags and lift banners in celebration after beating @entity5 convincingly in @entity27 @entity1 ( left ) and @entity70 ( right ) react as @entity71 survives a run out chance contrast that with @entity23			1
they get off to a good start , lose a wicket like @entity5 , but then in walks a world class no 3 in @entity71 who knew exactly how to pace the innings and ensure @entity23 won with ease			1
and how come @entity82 was left with just 19 deliveries at the end of the innings ? he made one of the best one - day hundreds i have seen from an @entity5 player last summer — and it was against @entity23 at @entity89			1
now he is not being allowed nearly enough time to put @entity5 out of sight			2
then , sitting on the bench , we have @entity94 , who hit one of the best @entity96 hundreds you will see by an @entity5 player			2
and that happened to come against @entity23 too , in last year ’s @entity96 in @entity100			2
@entity49 ( bottom right ) loses his wicket , leaving @entity5 at 71 - 2 during their innings @entity94 ( left ) is sitting on a beach , and @entity82 ( right ) got 19 deliveries - something needs to change @entity23 must have looked at @entity5 and laughed to see two such key players being under - used and , worse , not being used at all			1
then we have bowling that was just too one - dimensional to make any sort of impact on @entity23			1
it was all right - arm , all one - paced and most of it too short			0
we can not just bang the ball in halfway down and expect to bully sub-continental players any more			0
it just ai n’t going to happen these days			0
@entity117 has been @entity5 ’s most economical bowler at this @entity6			2
so why not play a second spinner in @entity119 ? or why not try @entity121 ’s cutters with the keeper standing up ? @entity1 and the men in charge of @entity5 need to take a good hard look at themselves after their defeat @entity127 ( left ) and @entity71 helped @entity23 to a comfortable win over @entity5 in @entity129 anything to get a bit more variety into the attack because the bowlers offered @entity1 nothing in @entity27			1
they just never looked like getting people out , even if a couple of chances did go down			0
in the first over of the batting power - play , with fine leg up , @entity139 banged one in short and was hit for four by @entity71			0
then from the first ball of the second over @entity146 did the same the same thing and was hit for six			0
it just is n’t working and @entity5 need a rethink			2
there is no magic fix			0
there are n’t lots of brilliant players waiting to come in to this one - day side			1
those who are on the outside are there for a reason and have , in most cases , fallen short to a larger or smaller degree			0
that ’s why i keep on saying the culture has to change as much as the personnel			0
@entity165 and team - mate @entity127 shake hands with @entity1 after @entity23 's nine - wicket win @entity169 coach @entity168 has shown that a change in coach can change a culture too from what i ’ve heard over the last year or two that culture has been driven by pre-meditated plans and statistics when it should be gut feeling and instinct the next week needs to be spent thinking how @entity5 can start playing a different brand of one - day cricket			1
the captain , who used to play with that gut feeling and instinct , needs to take the lead but @entity168 has shown that the coach can change a culture too			0
@entity5 can not go into their remaining matches at this @entity6 with their fingers crossed			0
boy , do they need to start plotting a new way forward .			0

@entity23 beat @entity5 by nine wickets and something needs to change
the bowling was one - dimensional and there were players out of position
@entity82 got just 19 deliveries , despite *impressing* last summer against @entity23 at @entity89 - why not give him more of a chance ?
the next week needs to be spent thinking how @entity5 can start playing a different brand of one - day cricket because this is *n't* working
