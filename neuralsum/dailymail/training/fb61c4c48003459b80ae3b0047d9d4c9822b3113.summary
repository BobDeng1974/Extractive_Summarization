@entity0 has been revealed as the most ethnically mixed country on the planet according to a new scientific study that blows apart misconceptions that western nations are the most racially diverse			0
academics at @entity8 's @entity7 spent a painstaking 11 years studying 650 different ethnic groups across 190 countries			1
using data from sources including national censuses , @entity15 , the @entity16 , @entity17 and a 1998 study called ' @entity19 ' , scientists gave each country			1
using that data , they worked out an ' ethnicity rating ' for each country based on the question : if you picked two people at random in any nation and asked them their ethnicity , what are the chances that they would give a different answer ? and as this map shows , it has thrown up some rather unexpected results			0
surprising ? this map shows the planet 's most and least ethnically diverse nations in the world			0
the countries in green are the most diverse , while those in red are the least @entity0 is home to more than 40 different indigenous ethnic groups , including the @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 - all of which have their own languages , cultures and customs			1
while the @entity54 nation tops the list , at the bottom came @entity56 which was classed the world 's most homogenous nation			0
but perhaps what will prove most surprising to some , @entity59 is revealed as the least ethnically diverse continent on the planet , with the @entity64 and @entity65 as two of the most			2
the revelation will stick with certain right - wing political parties who claim that mass immigration has diluted indigenous culture and custom and left their societies with little or no tangible sense of national identity			0
at the other end of the scale , @entity76 is exposed as the world 's most racially diverse continent			2
indeed , the top 20 most diverse nations in the world are all in @entity76			1
@entity83 and bottom : while @entity0 , left , tops the list , at the bottom came @entity56 , right , which was classed the world 's most homogenous nation meanwhile , the @entity87 came almost exactly in the middle with @entity89 ranked more diverse than its southern neighbour			1
the study comes after the global social attitudes study claimed that the most racially intolerant populations are all in the developing world , with @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 in the top five			0
by contrast , the study of 80 countries over three decades found @entity103 countries were most accepting of other cultures with @entity64 , the @entity87 , @entity89 and @entity105 more tolerant than anywhere else .			2

the map was developed after 11 years of painstaking **research** by academics at @entity8
during the process , scientists analysed 650 different ethnic groups across 190 countries
they based their **research** on sources including national censuses , @entity15 and the @entity16
@entity59 is the most ethnically homogenous continent while top 20 most diverse countries are all in @entity76
@entity89 is more diverse than the @entity87 , which ranked almost exactly in the middle
