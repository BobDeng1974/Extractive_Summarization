the @entity10 projects were expected to tackle poverty , but have been criticsed for not being spent properly during that period the @entity3 gave the @entity12 – a vast mineral - rich nation plagued by poverty and civil war – around £ 240million through the @entity10			1
but more than half the @entity38 aid has effectively been poured down the drain			2

@entity86 , a @entity87 mep and former @entity70 chief accountant , said : ‘ this is the same old story			0
the commission is not ensuring that taxpayers ’ money is being spent properly			0
