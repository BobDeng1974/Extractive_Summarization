@entity8 @entity7 , who worked with @entity2 in the 1960s , spoke of his guilt for the first time today as police investigate 300 potential victims of the @entity14 'll fix it host			1
the 64 - year - old declared he ' should be punished ' for not realising what was happening throughout their 40 year friendship			2
scroll down to watch video ' @entity22 ' : @entity7 was so distraught at @entity2 's funeral in november last year he wore a ' @entity14 fixed it for me ' badge and jumper but has since said he feels guilty for failing to notice any of the alleged abuse done by @entity2 during their 40 - year friendship but the @entity8 , who wore a ‘ @entity2 ’s eager helper ’ jumper and ‘ @entity14 fixed it for me ’ badge as tribute to the star at his funeral in november last year , claims he never saw anything to make him suspect @entity2 was abusing girls			1
he told @entity38 : ‘ i just do n’t recognise this so you end up blaming yourself			2
‘ i just do n’t know what ’s going on			2
i feel i should be punished			2
i ’m very distressed about the whole thing			0
’ the pair worked together at the @entity44 in @entity45 in the 1960s where they formed a friendship , continuing to stay in touch throughout their careers			1
' would have spoken out ' : mr @entity7 said that if he had seen anything to suggest the alleged abuse done by @entity2 , pictured left on @entity53 in 1976 and right in 2007 , he would have spoken out mr @entity7 said : ‘ you look up to somebody for years and then suddenly wham , bam , wallop , thank you , what have i been doing ? ‘ there is nothing i recognise at all			1
i ca n’t help but blame myself and there must be other people like me			0
you think , “ hang on , if we ’d seen something we would have spoken out ”			0
‘ the 70s were the 70s and we were having fun			0
a lot of it was a bit of a blur because we were all having a bit of fun			0
‘ but when i read in the paper something about a nine - year - old boy , or whatever , i think , “ this ca n’t be real ”			2
’ dj pals : mr @entity7 knew @entity2 from working together at the @entity44 in @entity45 in the 1960s and remained friends throughout their careers as the scandal went public and the allegations worsened , mr @entity7 decided to leave his home in @entity83 , @entity84 and headed for @entity85			1
of their 40 - year friendship , mr @entity7 said : ‘ i knew him through working as a dj. i was based at the @entity44 and i met him originally when i was in a band			1

‘ after the @entity44 , @entity14 moved out of @entity45 and people at the club hardly ever saw him			1
i kept in touch and we ’d bump into each other every now and then			0
’ mr @entity7 found it hard to believe that none of those close to @entity105 had not known about the abuse that carried on for years			1
he said : ‘ everyone knows @entity14 was a canny fella			0
compared to @entity14 , i ’m insignificant but he was mixing with people who were equally as shrewd and canny and had reputations to protect			0
‘ what i ca n’t get my head around is if there were so many shrewd and canny people around him , how come they did n’t see anything ? ‘ for them all to say they did n’t notice , well it all sounds unbelievable			2
like a lot of others i ’m completely and utterly gobsmacked			0
‘ you feel traumatised and sorry for the people abused by @entity2 but equally you think , “ why the bloody hell did n’t we see something ? ” ’ mr @entity7 ’s comments come after it was revealed that @entity2 was barred from any involvement with the @entity131 's @entity133 charity			1
repeated complaints were made by victims made to police , including officers in @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 but officers found that there was not enough evidence to proceed with the allegations they received			0
