by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 13:40 est , 22 january 2014 whether it ’s with a good luck dance , whispering a curse or prayers sent directly to @entity7 , half of american football fans believe supernatural forces are at play right alongside their favorite quarterback			1
a study from the @entity12 found that a full third of all football fans pray directly to @entity7 to help out their favorite teams			1
with @entity17 just days away , the study forces the question : will @entity7 be rooting for the @entity19 or @entity20 ? are you there @entity7 ? it 's me , @entity25 : a @entity12 study found that whether its @entity7 , voodoo curses or prayer , 50 percent of @entity27 think higher powers are at play during games			1
but the question of who those forces will shine on -- @entity36 and @entity37 ( left ) or @entity38 and @entity25 ( right ) -- remains to be seen in the upcoming @entity39 ‘ just ahead of the @entity17 , 50 percent of sports fans see some aspect of the supernatural at play in sports , ’ reports the january 16 survey of 1,011 people in @entity42 and @entity43 between january 8 – 12			1
the supernatural , as per the survey results , can mean one of several of things and even included wearing a lucky article of clothing to help out a team			2
which is exactly what one in four american football fans say they do when they want to sway a game ’s outcome			1
one in three fans takes a more direct approach by praying directly to @entity7 to help their team			2
on the flipside , some 31 percent of fans thinks their team has somehow been cursed when they perform poorly			2

@entity7 and football : the study found that football fans are more likely than fans of other sports to believe that @entity7 affects the outcome of games a january 16 survey published from the @entity78 asked 1,011 @entity42 and @entity43 speaking football fans about their supernatural beliefs as they apply to @entity27 's favorite sport			1
21 percent do a ritual like wearing good luck clothing or doing a little dance in the belief it helps sway games 25 percent of fans said they honestly believe the team they root for has been cursed 22 percent say ' @entity7 plays a role in which team wins a sporting event ' 26 percent pray to @entity7 to hep their team , apparently whether they believe it helps or not ( see above ) whether its @entity7 , voodoo curses or any other unseen force , 50 percent of fans see some aspect of the supernatural at play in sports so , as all those fans are praying , donning special jerseys or doing little rituals like a team dance ( 21 percent ) , will the @entity106 creator be sending good juju in any specific team ’s direction ? ‘ no , ’ rabbi @entity114 of the @entity115 of @entity116 told @entity117			1
' the truth is we do n't believe that this is the kind of thing @entity7 needs to or should be getting involved with			2
' @entity124 analyst , former pro-football player and devout @entity122 @entity121 does n’t see it as quite so black and white			0
‘ it 's one of those tricky questions , ’ he said			0
‘ i believe @entity7 has your best interest in mind			0
how that correlates to winning and losing football games , i 'm not fully sure			0
’ as for individual athletes , @entity114 seems to believe there ’s more than meets the eye than just physical talent			0
' on the other hand , let 's take the @entity140 phenomenon , ' @entity114 said			0
' a lot of people made fun of it , but here was a devout @entity122 , an honorable man , a world - class athlete — although he may have not had the success later in his career — at that moment , him choosing to acknowledge his creator as the source of his strength ... i think it demonstrated a certain piety which i think is admirable			0
' and on this , a majority of @entity27 would agree			0
according to the @entity12 study , ‘ more than 6 - in - 10 white evangelical protestants ( 62 percent ) and minority @entity159 ( 65 percent ) believe that @entity7 rewards athletes			1
half of @entity164 , 44 percent of white mainline @entity159 and only 22 percent of religiously unaffiliated @entity27 believe that @entity7 rewards athletes who have faith			1
’ earlier this week , @entity168 @entity167 gave his unequivocal take on religion and football			0
in what @entity27 may see as a way of tipping the scales in his team ’s favor , @entity167 told the @entity178 : ‘ as much as we worship this thing called a ring and championship , although we would like to have one for sure , i just ca n’t wait to tell people if that happens @entity7 willing , we will be able to tell people @entity185 is way better still			2
