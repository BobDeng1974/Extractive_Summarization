women who sport the look or use styling products such as heated rollers or straightening irons risk damaging their scalp and losing hair , say scientists			1
the @entity10 facelift , adopted by women including @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity3 ’s @entity5 , involves pulling the hair into such a tight ponytail that the face is stretched like it would be with surgery			1
it is named after the hometown of supermodel @entity1 , who popularised the style			0
in other parts of the country the look has different names : in @entity37 it is known as the ' @entity39 facelift ' , in @entity40 the ' @entity38 ' , and in other areas simply the ' council house facelift '			0
but university researchers in @entity44 have warned that the style could be permanently damaging , and not only to the hair itself , but to the scalp too			2
and so too could other female styling accessories , including hot rollers , straightening irons and chemical relaxers , used to unwind tight curly hair			1
dermatologists at the @entity55 in the @entity56 have discovered that both the hairstyle and these modern hair accessories leads to hair loss from the root itself and chemical damage to the scalp			2
and while these problems can sometimes be remedied with treatment , this specific type of hair loss - known as traction alopecia ' - is often permanent and can lead to bald patches			1
@entity69 supermodel @entity1 , left , who comes from @entity10 , the @entity71 borough which loaned its name to the hairstyle , and @entity44 actress @entity73 , right , who adopted the look across the @entity75 the study recommends ' hair holidays ' where women take a regular day off from styling their hair to let it recover naturally from all the hot irons and rough treatment of previous days			1
tips to avoid damage include regular washing - as a buildup of oil is bad for the roots - and using ' natural hairstyles ' that do not need heat treatment , because these place less tension on roots			0
research leader dr @entity95 said : ' pulling hair into tight ponytails or braids ; using hot rollers , curling irons , or straightening irons ; and applying chemical relaxers can all lead to structural damage of the hair shaft as well as thermal and chemical damage to the skin of the scalp			1
@entity109 @entity24 , left , comes from @entity110 , while @entity111 judge @entity25 is from @entity112 in north @entity71 , but both have a soft spot for the @entity10 facelift , which could be seriously damaging their scalps forever ' regular and sometimes even occasional use of these hair techniques may lead to hair breakage and hair loss from the root			2
' although usually reversible , hair loss occasionally can be permanent with longstanding or severe cases			0
' scraping the hair back into a @entity10 facelift puts too much ' structural ' pressure on the root of the hair , said the study .			0
