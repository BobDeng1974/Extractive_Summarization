by @entity0 a wealthy @entity2 socialite non-too - pleased with the prospect of living next door to @entity6 's top diplomat to the @entity7 has thrown a wrench in the country 's $ 7.8 million attempt to buy an official residence in her @entity13 co-op building			1
not on her watch : @entity2 socialite @entity15 upended the sale of a long languishing apartment in her co-op because she did n't like the idea of a @entity6 ambassador moving in ambassador @entity21 and the @entity6 government will have to continue their search for stateside digs now that @entity15 , resident of famous @entity27 co-op tower dubbed @entity28 , has gotten her way			1
fearful of too many guests , constant entertaining and of a neighbor who fancies himself above the law , @entity15 penned waged a biter campaign to urge her fellow stakeholders to block the sale of the 14 - room co-op to @entity6 , or any foreign emissaries			1
the @entity39 obtained a letter @entity15 wrote to her neighbors in june after @entity6 first made their bid for the place in may			1
' it is not in the interests of the residents of @entity28 to cohabit with foreign emissaries who are , to a large extent , beyond the reach of the law , ' @entity15 wrote			2
built in 1931 , @entity28 offers sweeping views on the @entity52 just a couple of blocks from @entity54			0
considered one of @entity2 's finest apartment buildings , it would have been a choice spot for @entity21 and for subsequent ambassadors			1
' [ the ] 5 bedroom , 5.5 bathroom , duplex offers the grace and flow of a bygone era with oversized rooms , 10 ' 6 " ceilings , fine proportions and large windows , ' reads the official @entity61 's listing			0
the home boasts a library and formal dining room , three maid 's bedrooms and a maid 's bath , according the listing			0
while the @entity6 agreed to limits on the number of armed guards in the building and to limits on sovereign immunity , @entity15 's efforts would ultimately doom the purchase			2
after the socialite 's campaign , the board placed tight restrictions on the number of parties the ambassador would be allowed and on the number of guests allowed at each			0
the good life : the famous @entity99 is one of @entity2 's finest buildings , but some say its intimidating co-op board has tarnished its appeal still looking : @entity6 's ambassador to the @entity7 @entity21 wanted to make the 14 - room @entity27 duplex the permanent home of the @entity6 ambassador , but his parties , armed guards and diplomatic immunity soured the deal for residents of @entity28 perhaps it was @entity15 's family ties to diplomacy -- her philanthropist mother @entity116 held the rank of ambassador as chief of protocol under president @entity121 and her stepfather @entity122 was a @entity7 ambassador to the @entity124 -- that fed her fears , but they came at an inopportune time for the building			1
the apartment , while among the choicest in the city , has been on the market for years and seen its asking price cut several times			0
perhaps it was for that reason that the broker who handled the almost - sale now maintain there was absolutely ' no backlash ' following the diplomat 's offer			2
' this is not an increasing trend , ' @entity61 's broker @entity143 told @entity145			0
' [ @entity146 ] is a wonderful potential resident and i am sure he will find an appropriate residence that he will be happy living in			0
' pictured is another apartment in the opulent apartment building where some of @entity2 's top elite have laid their heads at night			2

ambassador @entity21 will be looking elsewhere after resident @entity156 soured the deal on the 14 - room apartment
the @entity6 government is looking for a new ambassador 's residence in @entity2 , but @entity15 feared the constant entertaining would be a *nuisance*
@entity15 wrote a letter in june to her fellow stakeholders urging them not to agree to the sale and @entity6 ultimately backed out
