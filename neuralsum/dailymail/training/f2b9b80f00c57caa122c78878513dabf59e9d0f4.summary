by @entity0 the world 's largest underground trampoline was unveiled today in caverns which are twice the size of @entity5			1
bounce below is part of @entity8 , an outdoor pursuits centre in @entity10 , @entity11			1
as part of their latest attraction , staff have transformed a slate cavern by installing three giant trampolines			1
the trampolines are reached by train , with each linked by a 60ft long slide			1
it is thought to be the first facility of its kind , with the trampolines open to the public from july 3			1
huge suspended trampolines are to become a new tourist attraction in @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 when they open later this summer visitors will be able to enjoy a light show while they bounce on the huge trampolines , linked by a 60ft slide which spirals down to the underground space the colourfully - lit caverns are the latest attraction at the regeneration project , which has seen more than Â£ 1 million invested in it so far			1
@entity40 , owner of @entity8 , said : ' we got the idea when my business partner saw this done in woods in @entity46 but this has never been done in a cavern , this really is a world first in @entity30			1
' it 's a one hour activity where customers get dressed up in a cotton overall and given a helmet , they then jump on a train and travel inside the mountain			1
' there are three giant trampolines with three metre net walls to stop people climbing out			2
each is linked by a slide to go down and a walkway to go up - the biggest slide is 60ft			2
' workers preparing the attraction had to work using portable lamps and carried out around 500 tons of rubble from the cavern			1
business development manager @entity71 told @entity72 : ' the first trampoline is 20ft off the ground , the second is 60ft and the third is 180ft high			0
they are connected by shoots and you get in via a walk way in to the middle trampoline			0
' each trampoline is about 60ft wide			0
they 've been tested to hold a huge weight			2
' the huge play - area , expected to be a massive hit with kids , is built into an underground vault which is twice the size of @entity5 visitors will be given a helmet and a protective overall before they travel down to the site in a specially - built train , organisers have said the slate seams in north @entity30 , formed by compacted clay more than 300 million years ago , are some of the highest quality in the world , leading the material to be dubbed ' black gold ' by locals			1
the mining of the slate dates back to @entity103 , but the industry took off at the end of the 18th century and into the 19th century , when some mines employed more than 3,000 people			0
the government abolished slate duty in 1831 leading to rapid expansion and the building of narrow gauge railways to transport the slates			0
@entity115 production in @entity30 peaked at over half a million tons in 1898 , with 17,000 men employed in the industry			0
the slate was mainly used for housing , but has also been used for flooring , worktops and headstones			0
conditions in the mines were said to be very poor , with low wages and poor levels of safety			0
workers provided their own medical assistance by setting up their own @entity131 station underground			2
the miners went on strike in 1900 and the three - year dispute partly led to the slate mining industry moving abroad , first to @entity136 and then to the rest of the world			2
the @entity139 and @entity140 also saw a great reduction in the number of men employed in the industry and the introduction of other roofing materials in the post-war years killed off many of the larger mines			0
some of the slate mines were used to store precious works of art during @entity154 bombing raids in the @entity140 ( pictured right ) and the caverns are also said to be fall out shelters for the @entity157 in the event of nuclear war .			0

new attraction to open this summer gives visitors the *chance* to bounce on huge trampolines suspended underground
the trampolines are hung in cavern twice the size of @entity5 and are *accompanied* by huge light show
visitors will be given overalls and helmet and use a train to travel inside the mountain for the one - hour experience
