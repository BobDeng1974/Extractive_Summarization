on returning home from their two - and - half week tour of @entity4 , @entity1 ’s players will not be able to complain about a lack of opportunity to impress			1
as the new @entity9 manager continues to seek the best way to implement his favoured 3 - 5 - 2 formation , there are few tweaks , twists and turns that he is not prepared to try			1
on tuesday night , for example , @entity9 began this game against @entity16 at @entity17 with @entity18 and @entity19 up front			1
they ended it with @entity21 and @entity22 playing in those positions			0
it did n’t add up to much in the end			0
@entity9 were the more progressive team against an @entity102 side that included their former captain @entity74 and created the better chances			1
they could n’t score , though , and eventually won courtesy of an immaculate penalty shootout			2
with @entity61 , @entity68 , @entity29 , @entity26 and @entity27 making it a perfect shootout for @entity9 , @entity16 were overcome after @entity42 smacked his team ’s fourth kick against the crossbar			1
@entity24 and his players were perhaps vindicated for thoroughness of their preparation			2
in each of their open training sessions on this tour , they have practised penalties			0
in the @entity9 coach ’s mind , however , none of this will really matter			0
one gets the feeling that the @entity126 veteran is simply answering questions in his head about his players as he goes along			0
as he explained here on monday night , there are certain players who are going to have to adapt if they are fit his system			0
he has decided , for example , that @entity21 , @entity61 and the much - maligned @entity137 can not function at wing - back			1
the only chance they will have of making his team , therefore , will be at centre forward			0
too many men : @entity22 shoots as @entity16 players close in during his first appearance under @entity1 elusive : @entity26 escapes the attentions of @entity75 as he looked to take over the midfield clean sheet : @entity33 makes a save to keep the score at 0 - 0 at the @entity17 thank you @entity74 : united fans in the @entity154 send their best wishes to their captain who left during the summer eyes on the ball : @entity61 wins his header in front of @entity16 defender @entity76 @entity161 : @entity57 goes for the ball by climbing over @entity16 's @entity163 trip : @entity163 goes down under challenge from @entity47 during the first period getting fitter : @entity66 rides a challenge as he completed 45 minutes for @entity9 watchful eye : former @entity9 captain @entity74 watches on as @entity26 and @entity66 escape with the ball it would appear unlikely that any of them will in the long - term , of course , but at least they are being handed their auditions by their new manager			1
here in @entity177 , @entity61 actually did quite well			0
there was more energy about his play than we are used to seeing			0
@entity21 and @entity137 – on the other hand – were rather more fitful , even if the former did come close with a couple of low shots in the second half and the latter had a penalty appeal turned down			0
certainly , @entity9 maybe should have won			1
after a slow start that was noticeable only for a diving heard from a corner by @entity58 that was saved low to his left by @entity71 , @entity9 grew in to the game and began to threaten on the back of some effective midfield passing between @entity62 and @entity47 in particular			2
@entity18 curled one shot over the crossbar from 20 yards while a 22 - pass move from @entity9 in the 38th minute almost created a chance only for @entity62 ’s low cross from the right to be cut out by a defender			2
good viewing , @entity203 ? @entity24 watches while @entity36 laughs after @entity27 's winning penalty old timers : @entity36 poses with @entity16 vice president @entity206 ahead of the pre-season friendly joking around : @entity36 and @entity206 both retired from playing last season taking it to the edge : @entity62 tries to keep the ball in play under pressure from @entity75 @entity215 star : @entity9 's new signing @entity47 keeps the ball away from @entity16 's @entity82 on the charge : @entity18 gets away from @entity16 's @entity77 during the first half of the friendly whip it in : @entity61 attempts to deliver a cross during the first half of the match at @entity17 domination : @entity57 makes sure he wins the ball drawing a blank : @entity18 failed to make a mark hard to beat : @entity62 twists and turns as he tries to get away from @entity78 and @entity80 scored : young scored : @entity68 scored : @entity29 perfect five : all of @entity9 's penalty takers scored , with @entity26 and @entity27 converting the last two @entity61 ( @entity9 ) - scored 1 - @entity231 ( @entity16 ) - scored 1 - @entity232 ( @entity9 ) - scored 2 - @entity233 ( @entity16 ) - scored 2 - @entity234 ( @entity9 ) - scored 3 - @entity235 ( @entity16 ) - scored 3 - @entity236 ( @entity9 ) - scored 4 - @entity237 ( @entity16 ) - missed 4 - @entity238 ( @entity9 ) - scored 5 - 3 @entity62 himself then drove a shot wide from 18 yards before @entity24 made his changes at half - time			1
certainly the introduction of @entity66 was peculiar			0
the 19 - year - old defender was training here on the pitch with @entity9 fitness coach @entity247 in the hours leading up to the game and was n’t even listed as a substitute at kick - off by @entity9 ’s own website			2
however , he was thrown on at half - time and went on to do reasonably well			0
@entity137 certainly looked keen as he tried to make the most of his first opportunity on tour and one run down the left in the 55th minute left two defenders floundering before @entity74 of all people made ground from a central position to take the ball from his toe			0
the @entity264 defender was also on hand to intervene when a low @entity61 cross was about to cause problems and the more @entity74 went about his business here , the harder it was not to think he would have fitted in quite well in @entity24 ’s new three - man defence			1
as it was , both @entity137 and @entity29 both could have been given penalties late on before @entity9 substitute goalkeeper @entity33 was called in to action with a few minutes left , diving to his left to spectacularly touch away a free - kick from @entity16 midfielder @entity87			1
extra training : @entity9 boss @entity1 had said earlier in the week that new signing @entity66 was n't fit enough and excluded him from the squad for this match			2
he did take part in the warm - up however you look familiar : former @entity9 defender @entity74 , who moved to @entity16 earlier in the summer , walks out to face his former club			1

@entity9 have now won three games out of three on @entity4 tour
@entity61 , @entity68 , @entity29 , @entity26 and @entity27 all converted spot - kicks
@entity16 's @entity42 saw penalty crash back off the bar
match at @entity17 in @entity40 ended 0 - 0 after 90 minutes
@entity24 fielded a different team in each half as he continues to search for best *xi*
