by @entity0 , @entity1 five managers begin the @entity3 season next weekend believing they will be champions			0
@entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 are all serial trophy - winners with bags of experience			1
but if they expect their rookie rival , 41 - year - old @entity15 manager @entity14 , to be intimidated despite not having a medal to his name , they will be disappointed			1
‘ i do n’t lack confidence and i have an inherent belief in how i work , ’ said @entity14 , whose side came from nowhere to finish runners - up to @entity20 last season			1
’ with so many big beasts around him , there are many who think @entity14 may suffer from ‘ second - season syndrome ’ where the team crash back to earth , particularly having sold their best player , @entity40 , to @entity42			2
but they underestimate the @entity44 , who learned his trade as a coach at @entity47 under @entity7 and has rebuilt @entity15 admirably while coping with the retirement of @entity49 and the ageing of @entity51			1
old head : @entity5 will hope @entity54 's summer recruits can fire the @entity55 to the top of the league defending champion : the pressure will be on @entity20 boss @entity8 to retain the title happy newcomer : @entity6 has experience of winning trophies in @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 @entity5 , @entity8 and @entity67 are in their 60s with either @entity3 or @entity71 silverware to their name			1
@entity7 , 51 , has won both — in duplicate			1
@entity14 has signed seven players to cope with @entity40 ’s exit and the extra playing load of the @entity71			2
more are set to follow			0
he is sure that while he may lack long - term experience at the highest level , nobody in any @entity3 dug - out will beat him for detailed organisation			2
‘ towards the end of last season , for example , when we played @entity85 it was @entity90 ’s first home game as manager , ’ he said			0
the @entity92 : @entity7 has added considerable firepower to his @entity47 squad ahead of the season ‘ i did all my homework , as i would if we were playing @entity47 or @entity20			2
i looked at how @entity90 ’s teams had played when he was youth - team coach , what system he liked to play , and i looked at his entire history as a coach			0
he liked the diamond system , so we played a way to counter and combat that			0
’ @entity14 did not need to remind anyone @entity15 won 3 - 2 when the fixture was played in april			1
‘ i always do my work , ’ he said			0
he may be well behind @entity67 , @entity7 and others on his cv at the moment but it is not his intention to finish like that			0
hopefully i ’ve got another 20 - odd years left in the game and i will have success in that period , ’ he said .			0

@entity15 boss says he does *n't* lack confidence in his ability as a manager
@entity14 , 41 , points to his 20 years ' experience as ample to challenge for title
@entity5 , @entity8 and @entity6 are all in their 60s
@entity7 , meanwhile , is only 51 , but has won a *collection* of trophies
