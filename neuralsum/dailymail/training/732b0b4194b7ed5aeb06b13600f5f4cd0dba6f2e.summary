@entity0 finally sees the light at the end of the tunnel			1
formerly known as ' the man with the 132lb scrotum ' , @entity0 , from @entity5 , made headlines around the world last year when the rare medical condition - known as scrotal lymphedema - was featured on a tv special			1
fortunately , a @entity12 doctor took pity on the 49 - year - old and agreed to carry out the 13 - hour operation to remove it for free			1
but @entity0 was still not happy			1
he complained the surgery made his life a misery because it left him with a one - inch penis			1
he said he would never be able to have a relationship with a woman			2
but finally , @entity0 is feeling optimistic about the future ahead of more surgery later this month			1
( @entity0 weighed himself after the surgery and this was what he had dropped ) his ordeal began when he woke up one morning five years ago with a shooting pain in his groin , which grew steadily worse and his scrotum steadily bigger over the next nine months			1
' it was the worst pain i ever felt in my life , ' he told the @entity61			2
' it got so bad one day that i stood in my living room and cried			2
there was a fresh breakage of skin ... and it stung to no end			0
@entity0 adapted by turning hooded sweatshirts upside down and using them as pants			1
his penis was buried so deeply in the abnormal growth that he was forced to urinate on himself and said only wanted to urinate like a normal man and have a romantic relationship with a woman			1
unhappy : @entity0 expected his life to be transformed after he had his 132 lbs scrotum removed , but the surgery has left him ' disfigured ' surgery : @entity0 , pictured before surgery , is recovering after his giant scrotum was removed i was expecting to be stared at — if you look like a freak you expect people to look at you like you ’re a freak , ' he said			1
' i would only get upset when , every once - in - a - while , some person with no manners would stare at me and start laughing and give me that " freak passing by " look			2
' that caused me in the past to say a " word " or two with regards to rudeness			0
' besides , i was ok with the stares			0
that ’s what i was expecting			0
' at one stage @entity0 was so desperate he considered selling his testicles on @entity99 to pay for an operation to remove them before dr @entity25 offered his services			1
though he initially complained that he was ' still disfigured ' , he has since become more optimistic about his future			0
' i can see a light at the end of the tunnel , but i ’m still in the tunnel			0
' he will return to @entity112 's @entity111 / @entity110 radio show on monday			0
after he previously called in , he received an outpouring of affection from listeners in the form of donations and supportive e-mails , which he says he ’ll never forget			0
' if not for the generosity of those people who have helped me , i ’d be out on the street and disabled			0
' i want to give the biggest thank you in the world to these people — as big as the @entity125			0
' discomfort : @entity0 could not urinate like a normal man and wore a hoodie for pants to conceal his enormous genitals video courtesy of @entity132 talking about his life before the operation he describes himself as a prisoner to his testicles and that the growth ruled his life			1
' i could only walk in baby steps – i had to stop every 30 seconds , ' he said			0
' it was just horrible			0
i could n’t get in and out of a vehicle and even then i fell down on to the pavement and it took four grown men to try and lift me up			0
on april 8 , dr @entity25 and three other physicians cut away simultaneously on the grossly enlarged protective sac of skin and muscles that contained @entity0 's testicles and penis , according to the @entity132			1
the mass caused by the condition , known as scrotal lymphedema , had grown to 132 pounds in less than two years			2
the massive swelling was caused by fluid building up in his scrotum			2
doctors had to remove the excess tissue and then completely rebuild his scrotum			2
the extremely rare condition is much more common in @entity161 and @entity162 , where it is caused by parasites , than it is in the western world			0
for sale : mr @entity0 initially considered selling his scrotum on @entity99 in order to pay for surgery fear : @entity0 was also afraid of dying on the operating table or losing his penis and his testicles if the complex procedure went wrong			1

@entity0 had 132 lbs scrotum removed for free but was still not happy
said his one - inch penis left him with no *chance* of finding love
is having more surgery later this month
