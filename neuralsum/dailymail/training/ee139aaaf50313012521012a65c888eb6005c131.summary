the final design of the new type of usb plug that will replace all other usb connectors , has been unveiled			1
the usb @entity5 plug is reversible so users will no longer have to stab blindly at usb ports in order to connect and charge gadgets , because plugs will fit in sockets in either direction			1
the @entity14 said that the next generation design is thinner than its predecessors so it can be used in increasing sleek smartphones , tablets and ultrabooks			1
the @entity14 unveiled its usb @entity5 plug which is reversible and slimmer than previous standards			1
different types of ports are also pictured			0
the plug is designed for slimmer smartphones , tablets and ultrabooks but will not be compatible with older computer equipment without an adapter the usb type - c connector is a completely new design			1
it has been designed for use with thinner , sleeker devices , such as tablets and ultrabooks			2
it claims to be robust enough for laptops and slim enough for smartphones			0
it is being built on existing @entity43 and usb 2.0 technologies			0
the plug is smaller than current laptop connectors , and more closely resembles the size of the current 2.0 @entity47			2
crucially , it will be reversible meaning it will work whichever way it is plugged in			2
this is similar to how @entity55 's @entity54 connector works			2
‘ the usb type - c specification establishes a new cable and connector scheme tailored to fit mobile device product designs , yet robust enough for laptops and tablets , ’ the @entity57 - based group said			1
reports of the fabled plug began in december last year and renderings of what it might look like leaked in april			0
the usb 2.0 specification was released in 2000 and became the standard by the end of 2001 , followed by @entity73 in 2008 , and 3.1 in july 2013			2
@entity55 uses its own @entity54 on newer models of @entity75 and @entity76 , which can be inserted either way up			0
the @entity78 will work in a similar way , while resembling the size of the current @entity47 plug			1
according to the group , the @entity5 will be ‘ the only connector one will need across all devices			0
’ in april , renderings were released shat showed a thinner usb dock , better suited for tablets and ultrabooks ( illustrated )			1
it is only now that the design and full specifications have been released crucially , however , because the new design is different to the current versions of usb plugs , users of older computing equipment will need an adapter to use the new plugs			1
‘ interest in the @entity43 type - c connector has not only been global , but cross-industry as well , ’ said @entity101 , usb 3.0 promoter group chairman			0
‘ representatives from the pc , mobile , automotive and internet of things industries have been knocking down our door anticipating this new standard			0
' it is anticipated that everyday devices connected to the internet , from smart light bulbs to smart fridges will become increasingly common in years to come , as more consumers embrace the internet of things			0
' this specification is the culmination of an extensive , cooperative effort among industry leaders to standardise the next generation usb connector as a long - lasting , robust solution , ’ he added			1
the new cable and connector supports usb performance at @entity130 ( gigabits per second ) and provide up to @entity132 of power .			0

the @entity14 unveiled its slimmer usb @entity5 plug
reversible design means days of jabbing at usb ports to make plugs fit will be over as the new design will work both ways
next - generation plug is slimmer to fit smartphones , tablets and ultrabooks
as the new design is different to the current versions of usb plugs , users of older computing equipment will need an adapter to use the new plugs
currently there are no plans for @entity55 to adopt the new standard
