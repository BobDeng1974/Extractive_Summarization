can foreign players ever recover from a slow start to life in @entity4 football ? it is a question i have been asking myself since i was playing			1
every year , when a raft of new signings arrive from overseas , a saying is trotted out with great regularity that is used to mask underwhelming performances from individuals			2
you will be familiar with it : ‘ give them 12 months to settle in			2
’ the theory is that it takes each foreign import a year to get to grips with the frenzy of the @entity20 but , once they have done , you will see their form going up and away			1
let ’s make the comparison with both men , first and foremost			0
both arrived here from @entity50 , both cost astronomical fees and both men tend to operate in the same areas of the pitch			2
they are both left - footed but prefer playing centrally			0
@entity30 has scored three goals in five appearances since his £ 59.7million switch in august and will be the headline act at @entity60 on monday night			1
he has looked every inch a superstar and no apologies have been needed with regard to his form			2
@entity34 , by contrast , finds himself enduring more frustrations this weekend			1
a ‘ crack in his knee ’ may rule him out for up to 12 weeks but , even when he returns to full fitness , i find it hard to see the @entity71 leaving his unconvincing efforts of last season behind			1
@entity77 made me think in april when the @entity35 manager made the bold claim that @entity34 , his biggest ever signing at £ 42m , was ‘ fantastic ’ and he ‘ would put him on the list to be player of the season next season ’			1
@entity77 does not usually tend to be so assertive			2
even before he had a knee - ligament problem diagnosed while he was away with @entity85 , @entity34 had not looked like delivering the same stylish displays of his time in @entity50			1
look back at all the great imports to the @entity20 and you will realise they were operating at near - enough full throttle from a very early stage			1
@entity35 supporters should appreciate that more than most			0
it is a myth to say he did nothing in his first campaign at @entity99			0
yes , it may have taken him six games to score his first goal but he added another 15 in 41 appearances , the last of which — an 84th - minute winner against @entity107 in the final game — took @entity35 into @entity109			2
did he need a settling - in period ? if he did , it could be measured in weeks and nothing longer			2
once he broke his duck in his eighth game , the goals flowed freely			2
he finished the 1999 - 2000 season with a haul of 26 , including one sequence when he scored nine in eight matches			2
keep thinking of names and you will see a pattern emerging			0
@entity123 ? helped lead @entity125 to the title and the @entity127 in his first season with 16 goals ; @entity131 arrived at @entity132 in november 1996 and , by may 1997 , the @entity133 had named him @entity134			1
@entity135 won player of the year in his first season and @entity138 won the @entity20 in his first season at @entity31			1
@entity27 may have been too eager to try tricks and go down too easily when he initially joined @entity31 from @entity141 , but anyone who did n’t believe he was going to the top straight away was a fool			0
from a personal point of view , the best foreigners i worked alongside — @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 to name a few — were all contributing in their opening weeks and months			1
you could see at @entity154 with how they trained and prepared there would be no issues			0
the player who forced me to think again was @entity159			2
i did n’t rate him immediately but then , in season two , he took off and was sensational			0
@entity161 and @entity162 were slow starters at @entity31 but they joined in january , only played 11 games each and had found their true form by the start of the next campaign			1
@entity131 arrived in november 1996 and , by may 1997 , he had an individual award to his name not all players struggle when they arrive in @entity171 ; here 's @entity131 ( left ) picking up the @entity173 award in 1997 , with @entity135 ( right ) getting the same award two years before @entity34 played at the top level in @entity176 with @entity50 , but has n't replicated his form consistently in @entity171 that ’s why i was so interested in @entity77 ’s comments about @entity34 coming to the fore , as i just had n’t seen any evidence to support that before he got injured			1
i remain sceptical that he will have such an influence when he returns , too			0
if you do n’t adapt to this league early , the likelihood is you never will			0
@entity187 and @entity188 are fine examples of men who arrived as giants — they were stars of @entity192 — but never recovered from those teething problems			1
it ’s why i look at @entity195 , who travel to @entity197 on saturday afternoon , and wonder how it will end for the men who arrived 12 months ago , during the record - breaking transfer of @entity200 ( someone else who has had no issues with a new league in his first season ) to @entity50			0
@entity138 ( left ) helped @entity31 to the title in 1993 and went on to become their star player , while @entity135 also had a fantastic start to life in the @entity20 with @entity195 @entity30 has replicated the form he left @entity50 with in the @entity20 , scoring three goals @entity110 ( left ) took eight games to score but ended the season with 26 ; @entity94 ( right ) became an @entity35 great and had a fine season despite taking his time to score his first goal after his move of all the players who arrived during that £ 100m spree , only @entity217 looked good			1
but with @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 you can never see it turning , irrespective of @entity195 paying a fortune to sign them			0
they are not the first and wo n’t be the last			0
@entity230 will also be hoping their new foreign stars start to perform in the next few months or they will be in the same situation			1
should a player get in rhythm straight away , however , the signs can only be positive			0
that is why @entity30 and @entity237 wo n’t fizzle out after their flash starts			1
they have set a classy tone			0
@entity188 is a fine example of a player never getting used to the demands of the @entity20 @entity123 ( left ) with the title in his first year in 2005 , will @entity237 ( right ) be holding it in may ? @entity247 should head to @entity249 finals there has been plenty of talk of full internationals joining the @entity254 in the summer after @entity255 and his squad qualified for the @entity257			1
@entity77 and @entity258 have already come out and stated it would n’t be beneficial to their players to play and that ’s no surprise as they will always look after their clubs ’ interests rather than the national team ’s			1
that is a big problem in this country			0
my view is it ’s not a black - and - white case			0
@entity247 ( left ) and @entity273 ( right ) are two senior @entity171 players who still qualify for the @entity254 21s fully fledged regulars for club and country — like @entity273 and @entity278 — would benefit from a free summer			1
but for players like @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity247 , @entity284 and @entity285 — squad players at the moment for the seniors , who wo n’t play 40 - 50 games this season — it would benefit them and the squad			1
that sort of tournament experience could be vital for the senior @entity257 in 2016			2
full internationals @entity283 ( left ) and @entity278 could play for the @entity254 next year this week i 'm looking forward to ... ... seeing how @entity296 performs on saturday afternoon			1
the @entity195 defender was involved in the embarrassing 6 - 0 defeat at @entity197 last season , in a game which was @entity301 for @entity302			0
now @entity296 returns to the @entity303 , this time as @entity195 captain			0
a lot of people were surprised that he was given the armband by @entity309 but he was excellent in the last away game , the 1 - 1 draw at @entity35			0
the @entity312 has pace and power but lapses of concentration have cost him in the past			0
he can not afford any slip - ups against one of the world ’s best — @entity321 — on saturday			0
@entity296 returns to @entity197 after the 6 - 0 mauling last season as @entity195 captain			0

the theory : it takes a year for foreign stars to adapt to the @entity20
where 's the evidence to support ? look at @entity32 and @entity34
@entity30 has scored three goals in five games since his £ 59.7million move
@entity34 has struggled , and is now out until 2015 with a ' crack in his knee '
i find it hard to see @entity34 leaving his unconvincing efforts of last year behind
@entity131 , @entity138 , @entity123 and @entity135 all got used to the @entity20 *quickly* , winning *trophies* and player awards
@entity110 and @entity94 took weeks , not months , to get going
foreign players tend to have a terrific start , like @entity237 has , or struggle to gain any form after teething problems , like @entity187
@entity273 and @entity278 could do with a summer off
but the likes of @entity282 and @entity247 should play for @entity171 in the 2015 under 21 @entity257
