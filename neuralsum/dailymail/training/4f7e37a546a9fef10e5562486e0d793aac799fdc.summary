by @entity0 as far as adrenaline kicks go , you might have thought paragliding up to 2,500ft before plunging through the air at 125mph would be enough for even the most adventurous thrill - seeker			1
but not for daredevil @entity5 who decided to up the ante by using his wingsuit to fly between two residential tower - blocks in @entity9 which are just 40ft apart			2
despite completing 800 jumps in the past , even adrenaline junkie @entity5 admitted he was nervous before his latest stunt			1
' i felt focused in the air , not distracted by anything else			0
' i felt a huge sense of accomplishment and relief after the jump			0
i was just so happy it all went as planned and grateful for everyone 's help			0
' after passing between the building in his hometown of @entity20 , @entity9 , @entity5 deployed a parachute on the back of his @entity37 before floating down to @entity38			0
@entity5 ( right ) has completed more than 800 jumps before , but admitted he was nervous beforehand a friend flew @entity41 up to 2,500ft on a paraglider before he jumped off , using his @entity43 to steer @entity5 has developed a reputation for @entity43 proximity flying - essentially travelling through small gaps while flying at tremendous speed using one of the suits			1
in another of his videos on @entity52 , @entity5 captured the moment he flew down a narrow cliff trench in @entity55 , @entity56			2
his motto , posted on his @entity59 page , is : ' push it hard , know your limits , be crazy as hell , respect experience , enjoy your friends , fall in love , keep nature and @entity68 ! ! ' @entity5 then shot between the buildings , which are just 40ft apart , at almost 125miles an hour ( pictrued : the view from the back of @entity5 ' helmet ) after the stunt was over , @entity5 opened the parachute on his @entity37 and floated to @entity38			1
