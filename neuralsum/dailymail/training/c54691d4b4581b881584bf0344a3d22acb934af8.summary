by @entity1 reporter published : 12:37 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 15:07 est , 24 august 2012 this is the moment a police van got into a sticky situation - after getting trapped between two buildings in a narrow road			1
the vehicle fell victim to the tiny lane in @entity10 , @entity11 , and became firmly wedged for around 20 minutes			1
local resident @entity12 , 28 , took the snap on her @entity14 and it quickly became a hit on @entity16			1
thin blue line : police officers look on in despair as their van is trapped in a narrow lane she said : ' i was cooking dinner at around 6.30pm when i saw two police officers staring up the road in bewilderment			1
' i took a look and saw with amusement that their police van had become stuck , wedged between the wall of the @entity33 and @entity34			2
' stuff like this has happened before but this time i could n't miss the opportunity so decided to take a picture using my @entity14 as quick as possible without being seen			1
' i found it quite funny as it was the police , but luckily for them though , they seemed to have moved it after around 20 minutes			2
' the landlord of the @entity46 's arms , where the van got stuck , said it was common for vehicles to get wedged there			0
better call for back - up : an exasperated officer leans on the stricken vehicle as members of the public look on landlord @entity57 , who was n't there when the van got stuck last saturday , said : ' they are not the first to get stuck , and i am sure they wo n't be the last			0
' people use their sat navs and it takes them down the hill where they just get stuck			0
' it does annoy me a little bit because when it happens it takes off the guttering on the pub which i have to repair			0
' i am sure it will happen again , but i will admit it was slightly strange to see a police vehicle there			0
' i guess they were just on their way to a job and went the wrong way as everyone else seems to do			0
