the original photograph was taken looking north from @entity31 , now known as @entity32 , near @entity33 original steps : since a 1936 fire destroyed the @entity10 on @entity11 , near @entity12 in south - east @entity4 , the building that once housed the @entity13 has never been rebuilt eerie : mainly original staircases still stand on the site where the @entity10 once was in south - east @entity4 park life : the scene where the @entity41 - from approximately outside the concert hall - of the @entity10 once stood on @entity11 in south - east @entity4 before it was destroyed by a fire memories : earlier this month @entity45 reported how sources said the plan was still at the ' very early stages ' , and @entity4 mayor @entity49 confirmed that he had been approached by a potential developer @entity51 , who heads @entity52 , has had talks with @entity54 and the @entity55 about recreating the 900,000 sq ft glass halls , first designed by sir @entity57			1
earlier this month @entity45 reported how sources said the plan was still at the ‘ very early stages ’ , and @entity4 mayor @entity49 confirmed that he had been approached by a potential developer			2
the original structure was designed by sir @entity57 and stood in @entity63 , central @entity4 , where the exhibition was held			1
in 1854 it was rebuilt in a larger form on @entity11 , until the 1936 fire			1

he said : ‘ it may have been the site of the @entity10 - but it is now metropolitan open land , which is protected			0
i think @entity54 should be making this point very strongly to any developer			0
‘ @entity107 still harbours an aspiration to see a major development on the top of the park so the park does always seem to be somewhat under threat			0
there is a feeling of real déjà vu			0
’ @entity118 chairman @entity117 added : ‘ we 're not at the “ chaining to the bulldozer ” phase yet , but we should have the chains ready			0
‘ to accommodate a full scale @entity10 , the @entity124 of 1990 would have to be changed since it limits the footprint of buildings to half of the ' pink ' area ( defined in the act )			0
last days : the @entity10 is shown in 1936 , illuminated by the light of a @entity131 fireworks display shortly before it burned down @entity132 : the @entity41 of the @entity10 building is pictured in this undated photograph , looking north after the fire : ruins and remains of the @entity138 of @entity10 from a position outside the @entity140 ‘ this amounts to about a quarter of the original @entity10 footprint			2
there is a long way to go before we get to the stage of the top site being desecrated			0
’ a @entity54 spokesman said : ‘ it is a matter of public record we are committed to improving @entity152 which remains a jewel , not just in @entity154 , but in @entity4 's crown			2
‘ we are continuing to look at and explore all funding options , including grant funding , that might be available to help secure a long term and viable future			0
’ @entity52 was set up in 1992 by mr ni , a married father of four and self - made businessman said to have a fortune of £ 830,000			0

mr @entity51 ’s past projects include the futuristic @entity168 in @entity69 ’s financial district and @entity170 in @entity171 , a group of 78 @entity173 - style villas set in a mountain landscape			2
queen @entity176 's husband @entity175 had originally come up with the idea of an exhibition to show off @entity180 's industrial @entity179 was a huge triumph for @entity175 , who rarely enjoyed public popularity in @entity180 , and he used the profits made to help establish the @entity184 museums in central @entity4			1
relocation : the @entity10 moved to @entity11 near @entity12 in south - east @entity4 in 1854 smoke and ashes : the flames from the blaze in south - east @entity4 could be seen from eight counties destruction : the @entity10 in the aftermath of the 1936 fire , witnessed by tens of thousands of people			1
