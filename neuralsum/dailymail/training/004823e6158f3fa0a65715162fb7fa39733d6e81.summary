around 650,000 people in @entity1 have essential tremor , an uncontrollable shake that makes everyday tasks difficult			1
but a form of radiation therapy can resolve the problem			1
retired civil servant @entity8 , 74 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , underwent the procedure , as he tells @entity12			1
the patient @entity14 runs in my family			1
my grandfather and my mother had it , and i first noticed mine aged nine			1
i loved wood ( my other grandfather was from a line of cabinet makers ) , but i could n’t use a chisel without my right hand shaking			2
as i got older it got worse			2
teachers said my essays were spoilt by my appalling handwriting			2
and i even considered giving away my treasured stamp collection because i could n’t pick them up with tweezers			2
brain scan : a coloured @entity35 ( @entity35 ) scan through a human head , showing a healthy brain in side view			2
@entity39 is a radiation device			1
it 's called radiosurgery , because of it 's focus on very high intensity radiation on a tiny area , aiming to destroy it			1
it 's specifically designed for the head everyday tasks were problematic			1
when carrying tea i ’d do the ‘ teacup tango ’ — it would bounce in its saucer and spill out — and doing up buttons took all my patience			2
and when out for a meal , if i wanted soup i sometimes had to get on my knees to drink it			2
my wife was wonderfully supportive and i managed to work , but it was frustrating			2
i could n’t take the minutes of a meeting because my writing was illegible			2
i spoke to my gp at intervals but was always told i ’d get used to it			2
finally i decided enough was enough , and i was referred to professor @entity68 at the @entity69 in @entity70 in 2010			2
i was told i could have been a good candidate for deep brain stimulation , where they use electrodes to stimulate the area of your brain responsible for tremor , but because i ’d had a stroke in 2008 and was on the blood - thinner warfarin , there was a risk i could bleed to death , as it involves putting a metal probe in the brain			1
there was another option : @entity39 , which delivers radiation to the brain , would effectively burn out the bit of it that controlled the shakes			1
i was warned that there might be side - effects — such as speech difficulty , or limbs not functioning as well as before — but i thought it worth the risk			2
unfortunately , i could n’t get the treatment on the @entity98 , so my colleagues in the @entity100 helped me get funding through their charity to have it at the @entity103			2
i was over the moon			2
the treatment can get rid of essential tremor completely , but patients could possibly develop more tremor at a later stage the procedure was scheduled for september 2012 , under neurosurgeon @entity112			1
they began by measuring me up for a frame , which would be screwed into my skull to keep my head in place			0
it was a bit like wearing a tv screen on my head			0
after having two scans of my brain , i lay on a table with the frame on my head , and was slid into the @entity39 machine			1
i ’d brought some music to listen to , and shut my eyes			0
there was no pain , just a loud clanging			0
it took about two hours and i think i even fell asleep			0
when i came out , the professor took the frame off and asked me to touch my fingers together			0
he nearly fell over at how easily i did it			0
but it was six months before i noticed the major differences			0
now i can write beautifully and do carpentry , whereas before i ’d have lost a finger			0
i slur a bit now , but if that ’s the only side - effect , i could n’t care less			0
the surgeon professor @entity112 is a consultant neurosurgeon at the @entity103 , @entity70			0
he says : essential tremor runs in families but the exact cause is unknown			1
it ’s degenerative , so it comes with age			0
in people with tremor , the nerve cells in an area of the thalamus , the part of the brain that controls movement , are firing in an abnormal pattern			1
professor @entity112 , pictured here , is a consultant neurosurgeon at the @entity103 , @entity70			0
' as far as i am aware , i 'm the only surgeon in the country to use @entity39 to treat tremor , ' he said beta - blockers can be effective , perhaps because they block brain chemicals involved in tremor			1
alcohol can also have a pronounced effect			0
my father - in - law had the condition and was very steady with a glass of whisky in his hand			0
surgery is only necessary when it becomes a real social problem or affects daily life			0
there are three main surgical options			0
one is to put an electrode in the brain and use radiofrequency to heat the tissue and destroy the ventral intermediate nucleus ( @entity180 ) , the pea - sized area in the thalamus responsible for the shakes			1
you can also use deep brain stimulation , where electrodes stimulate the nerve cells in the @entity180 to block their activity			0
but both methods are invasive , risking bleeding and infection , and with deep brain stimulation patients must carry a battery around for the rest of their life			0
moreover , they are not suitable for patients on blood - thinning drugs			0
as far as i ’m aware , i ’m the only surgeon in the country to use @entity39 to treat tremor			1
i started using it in 1985			0
@entity39 is a radiation device			1
we call the treatment radiosurgery , because we ’re focusing very high intensity radiation on a tiny area , aiming to destroy it			1
it ’s specifically designed for the head : most commonly for brain tumours , but also for facial pain and for cutting off the blood supply to vascular malformations			0
we give the patient a light sedative , then inject local anaesthetic into four points on their head so we can fix an aluminium frame into it ( there may be light bleeding when it is removed later )			0
we then place a @entity224 cube over the top of the frame and carry out an mri scan			0
this cube has coordinates on it , so a computer can work out exactly where our target is			0
we then fix the head frame to the couch that goes inside the @entity39 , so the thalamus is right at the device ’s centre			1
once we turn it on , 192 beams of radiation converge on the target			1
each beam is quite weak , sparing healthy tissue			0
the radiation only becomes toxic where all the beams meet			1
there is a risk of slight swelling from the radiation causing weakness in the area of the body where the tremor was			1
it could also cause speech difficulties , because the nerve cells affecting muscles involved in speech are close to the @entity180			0
the treatment can get rid of the tremor completely , but patients could possibly develop more tremor at a later stage			1
we ’ve treated about ten tremor patients here with @entity39 since 1998			1
in @entity1 it ’s mainly used on patients who are not suitable for deep brain stimulation , but in other countries it is a primary procedure			1
a recent large study in @entity270 showed the two procedures had similar outcomes			0
@entity39 radiosurgery is only available on the @entity98 in exceptional circumstances			1
but the committee that advises the @entity98 has proposed that it should be available			0
the procedure costs around £ 15,000 privately , and could cost the @entity98 around £ 8,000 .			1

around *65,000* people in @entity1 have an essential tremor : uncontrollable shakes
everyday tasks are difficult , but @entity39 radiation therapy can cure it
