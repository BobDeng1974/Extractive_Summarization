life expectancy in @entity1 has increased at a slower rate than most of our @entity4 neighbours – thanks to our poor record on cancer survival and high levels of obesity			1
an international report has found that despite the billions of pounds poured into the @entity13 by @entity14 , @entity1 patients have fared much worse than those across the @entity16			2
survival rates for breast , bowel and cervical cancer are among the worst in the @entity21 , which represents industrialised nations			0
poor record : a women undergoes a breast cancer scan			0
@entity1 's low survival rates for some forms of the disease are partly to blame for a slower increase in life expectancy in the @entity1 compared to @entity31 not got to grips with it : the @entity1 's poor performance is also down to our high levels of obesity which lead to many deadly conditions like heart disease this comes despite the fact that @entity1 spends more than the average @entity21 country on health			1
the organisation ’s report found that the average @entity46 enjoys an extra 9.6 years of life than they did in 1960			1
but this is far less impressive than the rise of 12 years seen in @entity51 and @entity52			1
@entity53 , head of the social policy unit at the @entity21 , said : ‘ perhaps the problem is that the @entity1 has been complacent in the past – so convinced that the @entity13 is the right model , that we stopped looking at whether we are doing well or badly			1
‘ now governments have started to focus on why it may be that the @entity1 is doing a poor job on cancer			2
‘ the @entity1 ’s poor performance could also be down to the influence of alcohol and obesity kicking in			2
the @entity1 simply has not got a handle on these			0
cancer care has also been a problem in @entity1 : the @entity1 performs poorly on cancer survival			0
‘ the @entity13 has done all the things we can think of to improve the situation , and perhaps these things have not yet had an effect			0
’ beleaguered in the league : a table showing the @entity1 's performance in relation to life expectancy for women compared with other industrialised countries the @entity21 ’s report , healthcare at a glance , also found : the study revealed the average @entity46 can expect to live to 80.4 – 14th in the @entity21			1
this is below most other @entity4 countries , and almost two years less than @entity87 on 82.3			0
no effect : government campaigns to curb excessive drinking like this one in 2006 have clearly failed as the report says alcohol consumption has soared over the past few decades the country with the highest life expectancy is @entity95 ( 83 )			1
@entity1 women can expect to live to the age of 82.5 – up 8.8 years in the past 50 years , but lower than any country in @entity31 except @entity99			1
men have a life expectancy of 78.3 years – up 10.4 years			2
health secretary @entity102 said last night : ‘ @entity14 let down patients by focusing only on narrow targets and not on results			0
‘ this government will focus on what really matters – delivering great care and great results for patients			0

@entity111 lives an extra 9.6 years than in 1960 , says new report
but this is far less than the rise of 12 years seen in @entity51 and @entity52
consumption of alcohol has soared in @entity1 over the past few decades – at a time when it has *plummeted* in most of @entity31 ;
@entity1 men are still the *fattest* in @entity31 , although @entity1 women have been *overtaken* in the obesity stakes by @entity124 ;
@entity1 *doctors* carry out fewer *consultations* than they did ten years *ago* .
