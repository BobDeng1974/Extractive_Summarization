by @entity0 last updated at 9:41 am on 15th december 2011 supernovae are bright , so bright they can sometimes be seen with the naked eye , despite being hundreds of thousands of light years away			1
now astronomers from the @entity5 in @entity6 have caught radiation from the brightest category of supernova – the type @entity11 – just 11 hours after it exploded			1
called @entity13 , it was seen in the @entity14 21million light years away			1
not since 1986 has a type @entity11 been spotted this close to @entity17			1
before and after : @entity14 before ( left ) and after ( right ) the supernova called @entity19 happened - it 's the bright blue dot bottom right			2
it 's the brightest and closest stellar explosion seen in 25 years the light from thousands of type @entity24 have been studied , but until now their physics - how they detonate and what the star systems that produce them actually look like before they explode - has been educated guesswork			1
a supernova occurs when a star dies or when a white dwarf star sucks matter from a nearby star , eventually reaches a critical point and explodes with extraordinary ferocity and brightness - the equivalent of at least 10 billion suns			2
a star dying is a type ii , a type @entity11 is the latter variety and the most luminous			0
@entity45 from the @entity5 said : ‘ we caught the supernova just 11 hours after it exploded , so soon that we were later able to calculate the actual moment of the explosion to within 20 minutes			1
’ there 's a specific limit to how massive the white dwarf can grow , equal to about 1.4 times the mass of our @entity53 , before it can no longer support itself against gravitational collapse			0
explosive facts : a type ii supernova caught by the @entity57 in 2005 - 160,000 light years away ‘ as it approaches the limit , conditions are met in the centre so that the white dwarf detonates in a colossal thermonuclear explosion , which converts the carbon and oxygen to heavier elements including nickel , ’ says @entity45			1
‘ a shock wave rips through it and ejects the material in a bright expanding photosphere			0
much of the brightness comes from the heat of the radioactive nickel as it decays to cobalt			0
‘ @entity75 also comes from ejecta being heated by the shock wave , and if this runs into the companion star it can be reheated , adding to the luminosity			0
’ because they could closely study the supernova during its first few days , the team was able to gather the first direct evidence for what at least one type @entity11 looked like before it exploded , and what happened next			2
light fantastic : @entity13 glows bright - from 21million light years away @entity87 , an assistant professor of astronomy and physics at @entity90 and a faculty scientist in @entity5 's @entity92 , said : ‘ it only takes a few seconds for the shock wave to tear apart the star , but the debris heated in the explosion will continue to glow for several hours			1
‘ the bigger the star , the brighter this afterglow			0
because we caught this supernova so early , and with such sensitive observations , we were able to directly constrain the size of the progenitor			1
’ ‘ sure enough , it could only have been a white dwarf , ’ says @entity45			0
‘ the spectra gave us the carbon and oxygen , so we knew we had the first direct evidence that a @entity11 supernova does indeed start with a carbon - oxygen white dwarf			0
’ @entity112 of @entity113 said : ‘ understanding how these giant explosions create and mix materials is important because supernovae are where we get most of the elements that make up the @entity17 and even our own bodies - for instance , these supernovae are a major source of iron in the universe			2
so we are all made of bits of exploding stars			0
’ their results are reported in the december 15 2011 issue of the journal @entity131 .			0

the supernova lies 21million light years away , but astronomers caught the radiation from the explosion just 11 hours after it began arriving at @entity17
