in 2013 , @entity1 's goalkeeping coach @entity0 gave an interview to a @entity4 newspaper in which he spoke at length about @entity6			1
' @entity6 is a goalkeeper but he is also the 11th outfield player and capable of constructing play			1
[ @entity10 's @entity9 for example is physically imposing and has charisma but he does not have this ability to construct the game			2
' ' the work of @entity6 at @entity16 consists 80 per cent of the time in constructing play , while the other 20 per cent of the time he does the normal work of a goalkeeper			1
he receives very few shots against his goal			0
' @entity6 ( centre ) watches @entity1 play @entity10 at @entity24 back in october the former @entity16 goalkeeper has agreed an 18 - month deal to join @entity1 @entity1 goalkeeping coach @entity0 ( left ) is a huge admirer of @entity6 ' style of play given the way that @entity1 have defended at times this season , @entity6 may soon see those percentages radically change and he may find himself tested with an unfamilar regularity			1
nonetheless , @entity0 was making reference to one of @entity6 ' greatest strengths as a goalkeeper			1
the first roots of the @entity16 model of possession football were laid by @entity41 and he imposed a school of thought that a goalkeeper must contribute to different phases of the game and is not only there to prevent the ball going into his net			0
it means he is there to build attacks , to mop up the danger and prevent the opposition from creating opportunities			0
@entity0 is the advisor that @entity58 leans on most heavily and he is believed to be the world 's best at developing this kind of goalkeeper , the sweeper - keeper			1
@entity63 is deemed to be the best at this but @entity6 has been at it for some time now			1
@entity67 is another @entity0 protege			1
@entity68 , equally , is more than adept with the ball at his feet - he played for his school team as a striker until the age of 14 - but he does not impose his personality on the game excessively			1
that may be something to do with the more conservative instincts of his previous coaches , principally @entity81 at @entity82 and @entity83 at @entity1			1
what they admired above all in @entity86 was his tranquility			1
when i asked @entity81 whether @entity86 is now a match for @entity63 , he answered : ' better than @entity63 , even			1
@entity63 is an unbelievable goalkeeper with extraordainary ability , but for me he can be a little too impulsive			1
for me , a goalkeeper is someone that is usually calm and should not create moments of insecurity for the team			2
' @entity68 , pictured celebrating his side 's equaliser against @entity99 , is @entity1 's current no 1 @entity6 rushes out to prevent @entity101 scoring against @entity16 in the @entity103 final ' @entity68 , at the very start , was defined by his calmness in the goal			1
this is the most important quality for a goalkeeper			0
@entity68 showed a maturity beyond his years , he understood the tactical , technical and mental aspects of the game			0
' for me , he is the perfect goalkeeper in the modern game			0
in terms of his height , his weight , his pace , agile , if we were to make goalkeepers in a factory , he would n't be far off			0
if we were to design a goalkeeper on a computer programme , in terms of height , pace , agility , the length of his arms , his reach , the size of his hands , it would come out with @entity68			0
' @entity58 and @entity0 appreciate @entity86 's talents - how could you not this season ? - but this may be one part of his game that they are keen to develop			1
those who watch @entity1 frequently will notice that @entity86 has begun to take a more commanding approach in recent months and take a few more chances to deal with danger			1
his improved @entity143 undoubtedly has contributed to this but the @entity0 effect is also taking shape			1
his game has also noticeably come on since @entity6 began training with @entity1 in the autumn			1
that may be a coincidence but @entity86 is somebody that responds well to competition			2
as a teenager at the @entity82 academy , he spent time behind @entity156 's @entity155 in the pecking order			0
to break into the senior team , he had to dislodge two goalkeepers , @entity160 and the experienced @entity161			2
he will not be frightened by @entity6 ' reputation , only energised			2
this is the environment that @entity0 will be aiming to create			2
@entity86 pulls off a save during @entity1 's 1 - 0 win against @entity166 at @entity24 in november @entity6 ( left ) works out , wearing a @entity168 snood , with @entity1 's first - choice keeper @entity86 @entity6 , pictured making a save for @entity171 , is recovering from injury and has not played since last march @entity0 's status in @entity175 football could barely be higher			1
in 2013 , he was invited by @entity176 to address their entire academy			0
on a special day visit , he fielded questions from @entity99 's coaches and then led a meticulously - prepared session on possession football and playing out of defence			2
one observer revealed that @entity99 were ' blown away ' by the extent of @entity0 's knowledge and expertise			2
in @entity189 , they still marvel at @entity0 's dedication and talent			2
at @entity16 , he monitored @entity193 ' progress regularly during @entity58 's first spell between 1996 and 2000 , when he would take responsibility for the coaching of goalkeepers throughout the entire structure of the club			0
he would often go along to the @entity201 and @entity202 team to put on a session for @entity6 and his contemporaries			1
last month , i spent some time with @entity206 , who worked at @entity16 for 29 years and directed the famous @entity208 academy			0
' @entity0 , for me is the best goalkeeper coach in the world , ' @entity206 began , ' i have never seen anybody else like him in the football world			1
' with @entity58 , he was training the goalkeepers from age 10 and 11 through to the first team			0
@entity0 did stunning work with @entity6 , @entity67 , now i think that @entity86 has improved rapidly with this coach			1
@entity0 , pictured with @entity218 's @entity217 , is regarded as one of the best goalkeeping coaches in the world @entity6 launches himself into the air to claim a cross against @entity176 in february last year ' @entity86 is now the no 1 goalkeeper for @entity171 and @entity0 is the best in the world			1
@entity86 has always had the potential , we all knew that in @entity171			2
he has come through the age groups , @entity228 etc. with the coaches he has had , he has developed his authority and composure			0
' as things stand , @entity86 remains first choice but he will be challenged			2
yet challenges await @entity193 , also			0
@entity58 knows him well - he handed him his debut at @entity16 in 2002 - but he is not the sympathetic kind			0
long - term injuries are mentally , as well as physically gruelling			0
he may privately have wondered whether his body will be the same again			0
will he still be as fast ? will he still be as agile ? can he rediscover the form that leads many in @entity16 to believe he is the club 's greatest goalkeeper ? in @entity175 games against @entity143 sides , he sometimes appeared vulnerable under the high ball			0
there may be the kind of culture shock that @entity86 experienced in his early days , although his experience , you would think , would prevent major problems			2
@entity193 will need to improve his @entity143 significantly but he is already placing roots in @entity252			0
his family will move over and they will find a seven - seater car already waiting for them			0
he is now house - hunting in the @entity258 area			0
evidently , he is not at @entity24 to twiddle his thumbs			0
at @entity16 , he won 21 trophies , including three @entity262 medals			0
@entity1 now have two world - class goalkeepers			1
let the battle commence .			0

@entity6 has agreed an 18 - month deal to join @entity1
@entity1 goalkeeping coach @entity0 likes @entity6 ' style of play
@entity0 is a master of developing sweeper - keepers like @entity63
@entity6 has the ability to push no 1 @entity86 for his place in the starting xi
