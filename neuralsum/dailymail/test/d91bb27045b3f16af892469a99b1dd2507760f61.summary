we 're suckers for athletes who play with a lot of heart			2
in @entity5 's case , make that plural : hearts			1
he 'll tee off this week at the masters on his third			0
the 35 - year - old veteran would rather be known for his golf than what he 's had to overcome to earn a spot in the field			1
but @entity5 is n't shy about sharing his story , either			1
@entity5 shares a joke with @entity17 during a practice round at @entity19 ahead of the masters a first heart transplant at 12 , then a second in 2008 after a major heart attack - what doctors call a ' widow - maker ' - while driving home from a lesson with longtime coach and close pal @entity30			1
he 's been trying make up for lost time ever since			2
' it 's hard , but it 's also a great thing , ' @entity5 said on monday after a practice round at @entity35			1
' there 's two sides to me			0
i 'm a competitor and a sports person , and i 'm also the recipient of two transplants , and i know what that involves			2
so when you put them together , it does make a little bit of spaghetti in my mind sometimes you know			2
' ' i 'll take it , ' he added a moment later			0
it 's not like @entity5 had a choice			1
he recovered from his childhood setback to become the @entity56 1 - ranked junior in the @entity57 at 18 , then a two - time @entity58 at @entity59			2
@entity5 , 35 , is set to make his first appearance at the famous tournament this week but he 's spent most of the intervening years battling on minor league circuits , then becoming an advocate and spokesman for @entity65 , an alliance for national and local groups raising awareness about organ and tissue donation			1
in a nice bit of serendipity , his first appearance in the @entity71 coincides with @entity74			1
but it 's already a full - time campaign for @entity5 - he 's been displaying the organization 's logo on his shirt sleeve for a while			1
all of those efforts paid big dividends last year , when he carved out a spot on the @entity84 and nearly stole the show at the @entity86			2
his runner - up finish at @entity88 nudged @entity5 and his story into the spotlight - and earned him an invitation to @entity19			1
it was something he 'd longed to do since watching the tournament on tv as a kid			0
' for me , it was a bit difficult to watch so many years and think , i 'm never going to play in the masters , just because of other issues that i 've had			0
but yet , i just love to watch the masters			0
so it 's going to be weird , ' he said to laughter , ' not watching the masters this year			2
' @entity5 's wife , @entity108 , and parents @entity110 and @entity111 wo n't be tuning in this year , either , making the drive up from @entity113 to watch @entity5 play in person			1
it 's a well - deserved reward to be sure , since all of them had a hand in the push - pull climb toward the top of the golf hill			2
the veteran has had two heart transplants , but wants to focus on the week ahead , rather than his journey after walking most his son 's practice round , @entity125 recalled how motivated @entity5 was , no matter how tough things seemed			1
six months after @entity129 hit the @entity131 area in 1992 , forcing the family out of their home and into temporary housing alongside a golf course near @entity137 , he took his son to play a few holes			0
' we were in a cart and back then , he liked driving more than playing , ' @entity110 recalled			0
' but every time we 'd leave the tee , he 'd drive to his ball , and he was already hitting it 225 ( yards ) or so			0
so finally , about the third time it happened , i had to remind him , " hey , stop here			0
let me play my tee shots ! " ' he started playing junior tournaments in the area after that and a lot of the fathers would come up and tell me what a terrific story it was , ' @entity110 said			0
' but it was n't long after that @entity5 started winning those tournaments			1
... he could have sat back , said he 'd been dealt a bad hand and did nothing			0
so i think that 's what we 're most proud of - he refused to give up			2
' @entity5 chats with his caddie as he walks the famous course ahead of his first ever round at the masters @entity5 tries to strike a delicate balance between those accomplishments and his aspirations			1
after a promising 2014 campaign on the big tour , his breakthrough performance at @entity88 - only the second major he qualified to play			0
but @entity5 struggled this year , opening the 2015 season with a tie for 10th			1
he then wrestled with his driver and missed the cut in his next five tournaments			0
at the moment , most of his energy and focus are devoted to keeping the ball in play ' i 'm here in the press room at the masters , and that 's a great thing , ' he said			0
' but i do n't look at myself as somebody who is a role model ... i look at myself as a golfer who has used golf as a means to maybe put some of the tough stuff that 's happened to me in the past			0
golf 's been very therapeutic for me over the years			0
' as i 'm sitting here today , ' @entity5 concluded , ' i view myself as somebody who is going to try to do the best he can to compete in the masters			1

@entity5 has had two heart transplants , the last in 2008
@entity5 , now on his third heart , is ready to make his @entity19 debut
the 35 - year - old is also a campaigner for *charity* @entity65
his first @entity71 appearance coincides with @entity74
