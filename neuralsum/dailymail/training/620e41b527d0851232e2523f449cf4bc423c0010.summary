a @entity1 artist has proved his art is as good as a photo after he managed to get away with using his self - portrait on his drivers licence			1
@entity6 painted his self - portrait , took a photo of it and sent it to the local authorities when the time came to renew his licence			1
the 29 - year - old tricked staff at the @entity13 when he sent in the photo of the painting and it was given the official seal of approval			1
artist 's impression : @entity20 used this self - portrait when it was time for him to renew his driving licence ‘ i purposely chose a bad picture			1
it felt more realistic , i do n’t know anyone who holds up their drivers licence and says “ look what a nice picture ” , ’ the artist told newspaper @entity29			2
mr @entity6 says he had faith in his stunt , but was pleased when he was able to pick up his new drivers licence			2
‘ i thought it would go through , that ’s how happy i was with the original painting			2
but you never know and i was a bit nervous whilst i waited			0
' but at the same time it was a photo and i though it fulfilled all their criterias			0
' the guidelines set up by the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) state that a photograph used for a drivers licence need to be recent and have a certain level of likeness to the applicant			0
after the licence was issued @entity1 newspaper @entity29 contacted the sta who were stunned to find that they had been conned			2
final result : mr @entity20 's driving licence which used a photograph of his self - portrait good enough to fool authorities into thinking it was a picture although they say would ‘ definitely not recommend ’ the public using photographed portraits , they said they have no issues with mr @entity6 ’s licence and defend the approval saying they had no reason to believe the photo was a portrait			1
‘ i can imagine you would be able to spot defects on a larger image			0
the details are impossible to see on such a small picture , said @entity13 spokesperson @entity79			0
mr @entity6 added : ‘ this picture is a milestone			0
it 's a sign that my painting is getting better			0
' despite the @entity13 ’s comments mr @entity6 has not been deterred from his latest project which involves painting ten portraits of @entity1 looking to renew their licence .			1

artist painted a self - portrait , took a picture of it and sent it in for his licence
the painting was so life - like the @entity1 authorities mistook it for a photo
