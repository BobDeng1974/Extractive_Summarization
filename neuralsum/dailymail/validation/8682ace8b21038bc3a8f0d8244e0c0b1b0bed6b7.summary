it is a measure of @entity2 ’s progress that fixtures like these no longer end in boos and angry recrimination			1
as the final whistle approached , the crowd at the @entity7 were unusually vocal , anticipating trips to @entity10 and singing praise of their team			1
earlier it had the feel of one of the afternoons with which we have become so familiar in recent years , one of those days when @entity2 break world records for possessions stats but come up against an inspired goalkeeper and end the day with fans furious at their manager , the board of directors and life in general			1
but with @entity31 in exceptional form , @entity26 also outstanding and @entity27 thriving against the kind of opposition he relishes , @entity2 eventually cantered to victory in some style			1
@entity31 leaps in the air after opening the scoring in @entity2 's 3 - 0 @entity38 victory over @entity39 the @entity41 international gives @entity2 the lead on the stroke of half time with his sixth goal in his last seven games @entity26 is chased by @entity47 after doubling @entity2 's lead in the closing stages of the second half @entity31 gives substitute @entity51 a pat on the back after the @entity56 seals victory with a late strike @entity2 : @entity58 6.5 , @entity59 7 , @entity60 6.5 , @entity61 6.5 , @entity62 7 , @entity26 7 , @entity63 7 , @entity64 6 ( @entity47 6.5 ) , @entity27 7 ( @entity51 6.5 ) , @entity65 6 ( @entity66 6.5 ) , @entity31 8.5 subs : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 scorers : @entity31 45 , @entity26 81 , @entity51 84 booked : @entity65 @entity39 : arian 8 , @entity73 6.5 , @entity74 6.5 , @entity75 7 , @entity76 6 , @entity77 6 ( @entity78 6 ) , @entity79 6.5 , @entity80 6 , @entity81 6.5 ( @entity82 6 ) , @entity83 6.5 subs : @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 booked : @entity83 @entity90 : @entity31 referee : @entity92 / @entity93 click here for all the stats , including @entity31 's heat map from our superb @entity97 better measures of their real progress remain , of course			1
on tuesday night they visit @entity103 where you might anticipate another glorious comeback which ultimately ends in failure			0
then there will be the league table at the end of the season which will likely tell the tale of an opportunity missed to challenge for the title			0
@entity114 conceded that , even with @entity115 still to come to the @entity7 , @entity2 are not yet in the title race			1
‘ not at the moment , ’ he said			0
‘ but we can just keep going			0
we won eight of the last nine			0
we are stronger today than we were at the start of the season			0
‘ we suffered a lot from the @entity124 , where the players came back			0
what is for sure is that they understand each other much better than six or seven months ago and that makes everyone more dangerous			0
’ at least @entity2 are not going backwards these days ; the problem may be that they are n’t moving forwards fast enough but they are at least pointing in the right direction			2
@entity39 defender @entity132 ( left ) was fortunate not to concede an early penalty after brining down @entity64 the @entity2 winger crashes to the turf under @entity132 ' challenge but was not awarded a spot kick @entity39 forward @entity83 ( centre ) tries to evade @entity2 defenders @entity61 and @entity60 ( left ) @entity2 playmaker @entity27 ( left ) uses his silky skills to bring the ball down in front of @entity76 ( centre ) and @entity77 @entity2 's leading scorer @entity65 ( centre ) uses his trickery to escape the attentions of @entity73 @entity39 keeper @entity149 threatened to spoil @entity2 's afternoon with a succession of fine first half saves @entity39 manager @entity152 looked as though he understood as much and had settled for one of those afternoons when he aims to ‘ out - tactic ’ the opposition			1
you could hardly blame him given the resources at his disposal , with @entity160 and @entity161 the latest additions to his injury list and @entity164 ineligible			0
@entity80 almost shocked @entity2 with a clean strike on 23 minutes but at half - time , @entity2 had 74 per cent of the possession			1
at times it looked as if @entity39 goalkeeper @entity149 was has having one of those inspired afternoon			2
it was later revealed he was playing with a dislocated finger sustained in the warm up , a fact which made his performance truly heroic			0
‘ he ’s been a brave lad , ’ said assistant manager @entity175			0
@entity64 was having a less satisfactory time			0
thrust back in for his first start in more than a month , he did little to help his ongoing contract talks			0
three times he was presented with the opportunity to open the scoring ; three times he spurned the chances			2
@entity187 defender @entity186 closes down @entity39 winger @entity81 as @entity2 take control @entity79 and @entity61 compete for the ball in an aerial duel as the sun shines at the @entity7 @entity39 manager @entity152 lets his feelings of frustration be known from the sidelines he could plead mitigation for the first effort on six minutes			1
a delightful back heel from @entity31 set him up with just @entity149 to beat , but @entity132 came through the man and the ball to prevent him scoring			1
it might have been a penalty but it was @entity64 ’s own hesitation in front of goal which had presented @entity132 with the chance to launch his saving tackle			0
@entity149 would then make excellent saves from @entity65 ’s header on 16 minutes and from an improvised touch of the knee from @entity26 on 32 minutes , before @entity64 received his next chance			2
played in by a delightful @entity26 pass , he took a touch , looked up and struck his shot directly at the @entity215 denied @entity65 from a half volley and on 44 minutes he pushed away a strike from @entity27 , which landed at @entity64 ’s feet , yards from goal but he skewed the ball high and wide , appearing to lose his balance			1
@entity27 reacts after @entity39 keeper @entity149 pulls off one of a succession of first half saves @entity56 @entity31 gets his shot away despite being surrounded by four @entity39 players the @entity187 centre forward watches as the ball sails towards the left corner of @entity39 's goal @entity149 , who had previously kept @entity39 in the game with a series of fine saves , dives in vain towards @entity31 's shot @entity31 was on hand to provide deliverance just before half - time			1
@entity26 and @entity27 exchanged a delicate one - two , but such is the @entity56 ’s confidence these days , he nicked it off @entity26 ’s foot , took a touch and drove a fine finish into the far corner of the net			1
‘ it was fantastic because of the combination and the finishing			0
it was the kind of goal we loved to score , ’ said @entity114			0
it was his 14th goal of the season in 24 games			2
that @entity103 game aside , he is having an excellent season and since that dismal night , he has responded incredibly well			0
after being criticised for missing chances against @entity103 , @entity31 holds his hands to his ears to soak up the applause @entity31 strikes a pose midway through his celebration as @entity2 take the lead at the @entity7 @entity64 , who had several chances to open the first half scoring himself , leaps on @entity31 's back in celebration ‘ it ’s one of his strengths , ’ said @entity114 , who called his performance ‘ outstanding ’			1
having set out to defend in numbers , a change of strategy was necessary for @entity39 and they were equal to the challenge			2
they came out in the second - half with an entirely different mindset , pushing @entity2 back into their half and searching for an equaliser			1
in terms of clear - cut chances there was still little — @entity81 ’ curling cross which @entity58 spilled and almost let in @entity283 was one unsettling moment			2
but @entity2 were no longer able to play as they wished			2
still , their time would come			0
on 80 minutes , @entity31 dummied a throw - in to let in @entity26 , who played in the @entity56			1
he returned the ball to @entity26 , who drove it past @entity149 to cap a fine a performance of growing authority			2
three minutes later @entity47 , on as a substitute , exchanged passes with @entity31 and planted a cross almost on the foot of @entity51 , who had the simplest task of converting from close range for the third goal			1
@entity26 ( right ) gets some air as he battles for the ball with former @entity2 team - mate song @entity39 manager @entity152 looks on bemused as referee @entity92 is forced to hand over to assistant @entity93 former @entity302 forward @entity66 ( right ) was brought on in the second half to replace @entity65 @entity2 manager @entity114 watches impatiently from the touchline with his side only leading by one goal @entity307 midfielder @entity26 meets @entity31 's pass with a left footed shot to score his first goal since december @entity26 wheels away to celebrate giving @entity2 a 2 - 0 lead on 81minutes of the @entity315 derby @entity26 is swamped by team - mates @entity31 and @entity66 after doubling @entity2 's lead substitute @entity51 is in the right place at the right time as he meets @entity47 's cross to seal a 3 - 0 victory @entity2 team - mates embrace @entity51 as they keep alive their hopes of playing @entity325 football next season			1
