by @entity1 reporter published : 14:37 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 18:55 est , 27 september 2013 an illegal immigrant who attacked a ballet dancer , broke his neck and left him lying in the street has had his sentence increased by the @entity7 after being declared ' ruthless , callous and a danger to the public '			1
@entity10 , now 28 , was originally jailed for a total of 13 years for assaulting @entity12 on a disused canal towpath in @entity14			1
but three appeal judges have unanimously ruled the sentence was inadequate because the trial judge wrongly thought @entity10 , of @entity18 , @entity14 , would be automatically deported on completing his sentence			1
ballet dancer @entity12 pictured here outside @entity20 ( left ) and ( right ) his attacker @entity10 lord @entity22 , sitting with mr @entity23 and mr @entity24 , ruled there was no such thing as automatic deportation - and @entity28 could spend years resisting removal from the @entity30 on the grounds that it would infringe his human rights			1
the judge quashed the 13 - year term imposed at @entity20 last june and substituted an extended sentence to meet the danger @entity28 could pose to the public if released from prison but not immediately deported			2
the judge said : ' in our view , so targeted , so ruthless and so callous were the circumstances of this offence that this man quite plainly is a danger to the public			0
' the appeal court allowed a challenge by the attorney general @entity51 to the adequacy of the original sentence imposed by mr justice @entity54 and replaced it with an extended sentence of 18 years , composed of an immediate custodial term of 13 years , plus an additional five years on licence			1
horror : ballet dancer @entity12 pictured here in hospital after the attack the overall sentence means that , whenever he is released from prison , @entity28 will remain under supervision for the full 18 - year period , or until he is deported			1
@entity10 was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to mr @entity12 , then aged 19 and from @entity67 , on november 5 2011			1
mr @entity12 , who was an apprentice dancer at the @entity68 in @entity69 , suffered neck injuries so serious that it was at first thought he would be left paralysed and unable to dance again			0
but eight months after the attack he had returned to dancing in what his family called a ' miracle ' recovery			0
his father dr @entity78 said his ' incredible flexibility ' may have saved his life			0
mr @entity12 ’s mobile phone had been stolen and he had been left for dead on the outskirts of @entity83 near @entity84 at 00.45			0
attacked : pictured here is @entity12 in a ballet performance days before the attack that left him with a broken neck talent : mr @entity12 was one of the youngest apprentices to be taken on by the @entity69 company @entity91 he had been visiting his brother who was studying at @entity93			2
mr @entity12 ’s parents have set up a charity called the @entity96 , which helps other injured dancers access the right support and treatment			0
at his trial , @entity10 admitted stealing mr @entity12 ’s phone but claimed someone else must have hurt him			2
lord justice @entity22 said he was smuggled into the @entity30 in june 2008 in the back of a lorry			0
his asylum claim was unsuccessful , but he illegally remained in the country , living in @entity14			0
at first he claimed to have been born in the @entity108 territories , but now says he is of @entity110 origin			0
the attorney general welcomed the ruling , saying : ' this terrible attack on a promising young ballet dancer could easily have ended his career			2
' @entity10 used brutal violence on his victim and left him severely injured and in a paralysed condition on a towpath in @entity14			2
' i am pleased that the @entity7 found @entity121 a dangerous offender and increased his term to an extended sentence of 18 years			1
