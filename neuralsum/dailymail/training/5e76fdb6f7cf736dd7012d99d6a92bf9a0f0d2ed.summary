her name is @entity2 , but her name says it all			1
in the @entity6 it means ' close to dying ' - and that is exactly how she was found when she was taken in by the @entity10 's @entity9 in the @entity11			1
and when she was finally released after being nursed back to health , she repaid the kindness by hugging the well - known animal activist as realised she was free again			0
in the time since @entity2 was found , it has taken years of care and dedication to nurse her back to health , until finally she was strong enough to be released into the outdoors once again			1
each morning , @entity2 received a liter of milk			2
the caregivers at the center saw that she was recovering and making good progress			0
eventually , the day came when it was time for her to live her life free from human interference			0
she was put into a crate and driven to her new home - a sanctuary site on @entity52 in the nearby @entity53 , the country ’s second biggest river after the enormous @entity6			2
the waters were calm and dark			0
dr. @entity56 , head of the @entity57 , kept a careful eye on @entity2 inside her box			1

touch me : @entity2 prods her fingers through the slits in the wooden box the journey beging : @entity2 is placed into a box and loaded on the back of a pick - up truck for her journey to the santuary			2
you can see @entity2 's fingers coming through the slits it has been 20 years since the @entity9 opened in the @entity11			1
dr. @entity24 founded the sanctuary to provide care and hope to the chimpanzee victims of the illegal commercial bushmeat and pet trades			1
today , many of the chimpanzee residents are adults who need to explore and expand their horizons beyond the boundaries of the existing facility			0
recognizing this need , the @entity10 put a great deal of effort into creating a more natural environment for the @entity93 chimpanzees			1
it is to this new island sanctuary that @entity2 was taken			2
new home : through dense , lush vegetation , @entity2 is carried onto the island river wild : the sanctuary is on an island on @entity52 in the nearby @entity53 sailing : the @entity103 team and @entity24 transport chimpanzee @entity2 on the @entity53 for her release on @entity52 the @entity10 was provided the use of @entity108 island by the @entity11 government to help create new space for chimpanzees			1
the island is more wild than the enclosures at the sanctuary proper and the chimpanzees still have access to the care of staff			2
they even have facilities such as a dormitory that gives them a safe place to spend the night			0
the journey involved traveling by road on the back of a pick - up and then after 20 minutes of sailing down the river , the group reach a magical wild place : an island composed of hundreds of hectares of pristine and mysterious tropical forest surrounded by river water			0
during her journey , @entity2 reaches in through the wooden slits in her box			2
dr. @entity24 places her hand on top of @entity141			1
soon , it is time to let the chimp go			0
dr @entity24 : it 's a proud moment for dr. @entity24 as she tells the story of how wounda a female chimpanzee has been reintroduced in the wild on the island of @entity108 after staying at @entity149 when she was rescued baby steps : @entity2 takes her first step out into the lush green vegetation of the @entity6 jungle king of the jungle : @entity2 sits on top of the box she was transported in and takes a look around one hug says it all : @entity2 embraces dr @entity24 in a heartfelt moment of thanks and love wounded : @entity2 was living up to her name when she was found a couple of years ago			1
she was desperately ill and close to dying step by step : @entity2 was nursed back to health by a team of caregivers at the @entity10 in the @entity6 the long road to recovery : dr @entity24 and dr. @entity56 ( right ) discuss what the future holds for @entity2 ' this is a really exciting moment for me , ' ms @entity24 says to the camera			1
' @entity2 nearly died but thanks to dr. @entity56 she came back from the dead			2
now she has a will to live and is about to come into paradise and became the 15th chimp to be released here			0
' the dense forest of @entity52 is now home to 15 chimpanzees transferred from the original @entity93 sanctuary site over the last eighteen months			1
life has changed dramatically for these chimps			0
today , they can roam freely , feeling the wet earth under their feet , smelling the scents from the lush vegetation and listen to the island ’s mysterious sounds while they explore their new surroundings			0
on the island , there are a variety of trees that offer the chimpanzees large quantities of fresh , ripe fruit			0
to get to the fruit , the chimps often have to climb to great heights , which is a perfect workout for their muscles and brains as they balance on unstable branches			0
one day , the aim is for some of the chimpanzees to be released in @entity211 in northern @entity6			0
we 've come a long long way @entity213 in 2012 @entity2 was gravely ill. she was nursed back to health at the @entity216 go forth and prosper ! @entity24 and @entity56 watch orphan chimpanzee @entity2 after her release on @entity52 lazy days : @entity2 relaxes with friends on @entity52 a month after her release as the door to @entity2 's box is opened , she scampers around but stays close to her human caregivers			1
she stands on top of her box and sits down to take in her new surroundings			0
then , without thinking , she turns and hugs dr. @entity24 in a moving moment of tenderness between human and chimpanzee			1
the embrace between the two appears to last for several minutes			0
no words are spoken but it seems clear what both are feeling			0
slowly and cautiously , @entity2 wonders into the new undergrowth that lays before her			2
dr. @entity24 follows her a little way as she watched @entity2 munch on the fresh green grass			1
the delight on her face is clear to see			0
then , without so much of a look back , @entity2 heads off into her new life on @entity52 .			1
