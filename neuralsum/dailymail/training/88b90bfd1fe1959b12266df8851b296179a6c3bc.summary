chancellor @entity0 today said the government would press ahead with money - saving cuts to police numbers and said throwing money at ' deep - seated social issues ' was not the answer			1
he said that reform of the nation 's police forces was needed , which would make officers more visible on the streets			2
however , he rejected the notion that improving the country 's safety was a matter of simply boosting police numbers			2
chancellor @entity0 said today that the government would go ahead with cuts , as former @entity20 police chief claimed making multiple arrests was not the answer to solving society 's problems in a phone call to @entity27 this week president @entity25 congratulated the way @entity30 's police and politicians have handled the riots			1
. a @entity34 , a spokesman said : ' president @entity25 commended the prime minister on the steadiness he , his government and the @entity30 police had demonstrated in handling the recent riots and shared the prime minister 's hope that the situation would now continue to remain calm			1
' mr @entity0 's words will infuriate many , including @entity46 mayor @entity45 , who claimed there were simply not enough police on the streets to cope with this week 's rioting and looting			1
praise : president @entity25 has commended the way police handled the riots his words came as a former @entity20 police chief drafted in by @entity27 to help restore order to the @entity30 's streets said that making multiple arrests after a social disorder event was not a helpful strategy			1
former @entity64 police head @entity63 claimed young thugs and gang members should be made to ‘ fear ’ the police and stiff punishments for crimes			1
famed for his ‘ zero tolerance ’ tactics , mr @entity63 said that @entity30 forces should be more assertive with offenders , advocating a doctrine of ‘ escalating force ’			1
' you ca n't arrest your way out of the problem , ' he said			0
' @entity81 is certainly appropriate for the most violent , the incorrigible , but so much of it can be addressed in other ways and it is not just a police issue , it is in fact a societal issue			2
' his words came as police forces around the country trumpeted the arrest of more than 2,000 suspects , thanks in part to a number of hugely successful ' shop a looter ' campaigns run by individual forces			2
last week @entity27 was reported to have approached mr @entity63 to discuss taking charge of the @entity101 , and he has already enlisted him to help tackle the threat of gangs as a government advisor			1
however fresh doubts emerged today over mr @entity63 's chances of landing the top job at the @entity101 , which could be hindered by the prime minister ’s own police reforms and clampdown on immigration			1
according to the @entity113 , as a @entity20 citizen mr @entity63 may be blocked by the police and social responsibility bill currently going through parliament			1
it states that the @entity101 commissioner must hold the office of ' constable ' , which mr @entity63 , who has never served in the @entity30 police , does not			1
he could be sworn in but would then face another obstacle			0
those who hold the office of constable and who are not @entity30 citizens must have been granted immigration status allowing them to remain in the @entity30 indefinitely			1
however , the government has vowed to restrict the numbers of people being granted permission to stay in @entity30 indefinitely to limit immigration			2
@entity64 : @entity63 made his name by tackling gang crime in the city in further misery for mr @entity27 , a poll for the independent newspaper showed 54 per cent of @entity140 thought the prime minister - on holiday when trouble started - had not taken command of the riot situation early enough in the week			1
a former leader of one of @entity46 's most feared street gangs added that the riots were indicative of frustrations among young people , rather than an orchestrated outburst of violence			0
the 63 - year - old @entity20 said young offenders should be made to realise very early in their lives that crime will result in punishment			1
he said : ‘ you want the criminal element to fear them , fear their ability to interrupt their own ability to carry out criminal behaviour , and arrest and prosecute and incarcerate them			2
‘ in my experience , the younger criminal element do n’t fear the police and have been emboldened to challenge the police and effectively take them on , ' he told the @entity171			2
‘ what needs to be understood is that police are empowered to do certain things - to stop , to talk , to frisk on certain occasions , to arrest if necessary , to use force			2
’ the deadline for applications for the commissioner ’s post , which became vacant following the resignation of sir @entity182 during the phone hacking scandal , was supposed to be friday			0
however , it has been put back following this week ’s riots			0
@entity63 is not a complete outsider to @entity30 policing			1
he 's been a consultant advising different forces			0
in 1991 , he famously delivered a list of about 400 gang and drug kingpins he wanted to arrest to the mayor of @entity193 when he became commissioner			0
his initial success in @entity64 relied on big increases in resources - recruiting 5,000 new better trained officer			0
reports of serious crime dropped 27 per cent			0
in @entity201 he worked on smaller budgets , specifically tackling gangs , using @entity205 ideas of local areas taking responsibility for fighting crime in their neighbourhoods			0
mr @entity63 left @entity201 police in 2009 - after significantly lowering the crime rate and is now chairman of @entity213 , a @entity214 - based private security firm			1
the advert placed by the @entity216 states that candidates ‘ must be @entity30 citizens ’			2
mr @entity27 spoke to mr @entity63 - who has also headed the @entity201 police - by telephone yesterday			1
the two men discussed the possibility of mr @entity63 advising the government on how to deal with gangs			2
mr @entity63 said : ' this is a prime minister who has a clear idea of what he wants to do			2
' he sees this crisis as a way to bring change			0
the police force there can be a catalyst for that			0
' the pair are expected to meet face - to - face next month to continue their talks			1
but many @entity30 police officers are said to be furious at the prime minister 's decision to contact him			1
@entity243 , chairman of @entity244 , claimed many officers resented the decision to consult a foreigner about a domestic problem			0
he said : ' there is anger , there is disappointment and a degree of incredulity as well			0
' we 're local people who live in the communities , who work in the communities and police them			0
he needs to speak to us , not someone who lives 5,000 miles away			0
' mr @entity243 believes there were not enough police officers at the start of this week 's riots because the government has cut police numbers			0
he added : ' one thing that @entity63 did when he took over in @entity64 in 1994 , was he increased the establishment of @entity64 police by 5,000 officers			1
' how an earth are we going to replicate that with cuts approaching 30,000 police officers ? ' getting to grips : a police officer tackles a looter in @entity279 on tuesday night chancellor @entity0 today backed mr @entity63 and said there were ' deep - seated social problems ' to address but stuck to the party line on police budget cuts			1
' we are committed to the plan we have set out for police reform			0
and it is about reform , about improving the presence of the police in our communities , making the police more visible , ' he said			0
he told radio 4 today programme			0
' there are very deep - seated social problems which we need to tackle			1
' there are communities that have just been left behind by the rest of the country , there are communities cut off from the economic lifeblood of the rest of the country			0
' i do n't think the debate should be reduced to whether there should be x-thousand numbers of police officers or x-thousand - plus - one numbers of police officers in our society			2
' we want an effective police service			0
they have done an amazing job this week			0
we want to use the advice of people like @entity63 to really tackle some of the deep - seated social issues like gang culture			1
' but this is not just about police budgets ; this is about a far bigger challenge for our society , which is dealing with people who we have ignored for too long and helping them feel they have a stake in society			0
