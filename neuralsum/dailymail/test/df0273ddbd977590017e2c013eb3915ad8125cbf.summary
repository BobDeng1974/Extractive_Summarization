the @entity0 is reviewing the case of @entity2 , who was jailed for life in 1988 on the basis of dna evidence after raping and killing two schoolgirls the @entity0 is reviewing the case of a murderer who was the first man to be convicted on the basis of dna evidence			1
@entity2 was jailed for life in 1988 for raping and killing two schoolgirls			1
he strangled 15 - year - old @entity11 to death after raping her on a deserted footpath in the @entity15 village of @entity16 in 1983			1
three years later he raped and killed @entity17 , also 15 , less than a mile from where he murdered @entity11			1
@entity19 was finally caught two years later thanks to dna tests on all the men in surrounding villages			1
he received a 30 - year minimum sentence which was then cut to 28 years in 2009 , meaning he was supposed to be eligible for release next year			1
a spokesman for the @entity0 said : ' we can confirm that the secretary of state for justice has referred the case of @entity2 to the @entity0 for a review of his suitability for release			1
' if the @entity0 does not direct his release , it has been asked to advise the secretary of state on his suitability for open conditions ( @entity37 )			2
' once a case has been referred to the @entity0 , it usually takes around six months before a decision is issued , meaning the double murderer could be out this year			1
@entity2 argued at his 2009 appeal against his sentence that the 30 years was ' manifestly ' excessive			2
he was jailed at @entity44 in 1988 after pleading guilty to two counts of murder , two of rape , two of indecent assault and one of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice			2
announcing the decision to reduce the minimum term by two years in 2009 , the then lord chief justice , lord judge , said the appeal was being allowed to a ' very restricted and limited extent relating to exceptional progress in custody '			0
he emphasised that the decision ' has no bearing whatever on the continuing effect of the sentence of life imprisonment on the appellant '			0
the judge added : ' he can not be released unless and until the safety of the public is assured			0
' former lord chief justice lord judge ruled in 2009 that @entity19 should not be released until the public could be assured it was safe after the world 's first mass screening for dna - where 5,000 men in three villages were asked to volunteer blood or saliva samples - @entity19 was eventually caught			2
the lord chief justice at the time said after he was jailed that ' from the point of view of the safety of the public i doubt if he should ever be released '			0
lord judge said in 2009 that @entity19 's progress since he was first incarcerated ' goes far beyond general good behaviour and positive response to his custodial sentence , but reflects very creditable assistance to disabled individuals outside the prison system '			2
he added : ' on the evidence before us he has sought to address the reasons behind the commission of these offences			0
he has achieved a high standard of education , to degree level			0
' in 20 years in custody he has never been placed on report and he is trusted to help with the well - being of fellow inmates			0
' lord judge said : ' beyond all that he has made himself a specialist in the transcription of printed music into @entity109 , thus using the opportunities he has taken to educate himself in prison to the benefit of others			0
' this is an intensely specialised skill and his work is used throughout this country and internationally with the support of the @entity118			0
' lord judge said the court could not ' identify any sufficient reason ' why the exceptional progress made ' should not be recognised and given practical effect in the assessment now to be made of the minimum term to be served by the appellant ' , and reduced it by two years			0
on november 22 , 1983 , the body of 15 - year - old @entity11 was found raped and strangled on a deserted footpath running between a cemetery and a psychiatric hospital in the @entity15 village of @entity16			1
almost three years later , in july 1986 , the body of another 15 - year - old , @entity17 , from nearby @entity135 , was found in almost identical circumstances in a wooded area , less than a mile from the scene of @entity11 's murder			1
the dead girl had been taking a shortcut home from school instead of her usual route , but there can be little doubt that her assailant , believing he had ' got away with it ' once , was on the look - out for other teenagers to assault , terrorise and murder in the same way			0
initially , a local man confessed to the second murder and his blood was found to be the same group as blood found at the scene			0
there can be no doubt that had it not been for advances in science , he would have been convicted while @entity2 remained free			2
however , two years later , semen samples found at the crime scenes were used to match the dna of @entity19 , a baker and convicted flasher			1
he became the first criminal in the world to be convicted based on dna fingerprinting , following the first mass screening of 5,000 men in three neighbouring villages .			1

@entity2 raped and murdered two 15 - year - old girls in the 1980s
he was jailed for life two years after second murder thanks to dna testing
@entity19 was the first man to be convicted based on dna evidence
the @entity0 are reviewing his case and he could be freed in months
