by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 06:29 est , 27 august 2012 a father delivered his wife 's baby outside a @entity4 sorting office - just minutes after watching a tv drama on midwives			1
@entity8 , 35 , had to spring into action after his wife @entity10 , 30 , realised baby @entity11 was going to arrive before they reached the @entity14 hospital			1
mr @entity8 , from @entity15 , was driving his wife the eight miles to the maternity ward at @entity18 when mrs @entity19 told him they were going to run out of time - and he turned around to see the baby 's head already visible			1
dramatic story : @entity10 and @entity8 with baby @entity11 at a layby opposite a royal mail sorting house where mr @entity8 delivered their daughter no time to plan : mrs @entity19 's fourth child @entity11 , pictured at two weeks old , was born within 20 minutes he pulled into a layby next to the @entity30 sorting office and had to deliver his wife 's baby on the spot			1
bizarrely , the couple had watched @entity36 programme midwives just minutes before they were caught up in their own delivery drama			2
mr @entity8 , an emergency services worker , said : ' we watched a programme about @entity40 on tv coming up to the labour and i was at the births of our three older children as well so i knew roughly what happened			0
' it was just a stroke of luck that the baby was not breech or stuck , or she was not breathing or something			0
desperate measures : the husband and wife had to stop beside the @entity4 regional sorting office near @entity14 because the baby was already crowning ' with the other babies it took maybe 12 hours of labour but this happened within the space of 20 minutes and i was not expecting that at all			1
i thought i was in for the long haul			0
' i had hoped that as we were only ten minutes away we would make it to the hospital but @entity10 said the baby was coming and i had a look and i could see the head			1
' it was all quite surreal really			0
' @entity11 arrived two days early , on august 9 , weighing a very healthy 6lb and 12oz			1
inspiration : the couple had just watched @entity74 drama midwives mrs @entity19 said : ' it was all rather shocking			1
@entity8 was driving rather fast because he was trying to get me to hospital in time when it suddenly dawned on me that i was going to have the baby where we were			1
' we were nearly at the hospital when i told @entity8 , " it ’s coming , it ’s coming "			0
' we pulled up and by the time @entity8 had run to the other side of the car where i was sitting in the passenger seat , the baby ’s head was coming out			2
' there was no time to find the phone or anything			0
we had just watched midwives on television and luckily nothing serious happened			0
it was just a really strange scenario			0
' @entity11 is the couple ’s fourth child , after @entity102 , five , @entity103 , three , and @entity104 , 19 months			2
the midwife team at the hospital leapt into action thinking @entity108 was about to give birth when the couple arrived			2
but , having realised they had missed the crucial moment , they allowed mr @entity8 to cut the umbilical cord			0
mrs @entity19 added : ' @entity8 had to point out to me where @entity11 was delivered when we were on the way home from the hospital because i had been in so much pain			1
' he is so smitten by @entity11 and i think he does feel more of a special bond because he delivered her			2
his friends are now calling him midwife too			0

couple were driving to hospital when *pregnant* @entity19 realised they would not arrive in time
healthy baby @entity11 was born in layby within 20 minutes
