@entity0 are having their days at the beach ruined - by a huge pileup of reeking seaweed			0
residents of @entity5 , in @entity6 , have recently come face - to - face with record volumes of pungent kelp which was washed up on the shore by ocean currents			1
the odorous plantlife usually stays clinging to reefs offshore , far from surfers ' noses , but warmer waters in the @entity17 this year loosened the plants ' grip			0
stench : the washed - up kelp on @entity5 , @entity22 , is the worst in at least 20 years because warm water carries less nutrients , the plants are more likely to detach from the reefs in hope of ending up somewhere better			1
this , combined with strong currents to wash them inland , has piled kelp high up and down the @entity22 shoreline			1
@entity33 , @entity5 's director of public works , told the @entity34 that in his two decades working along the beach the kelp situation is the worst it 's ever been			2
unpleasant : the pungent weed is now in abundance thanks to strong currents and warm water eco-friendly : one expert pointed out that kelp washing up helps the environment by bringing beach hoppers ( pictured ) along with it however , while many , including local authorities , are not keen on the new vegetation changing the character of the beaches , others have praised it for bolstering local eco-systems			1
@entity52 , a marine biologist , pointed out that the slimy plants bring with them tiny sealife called beach hoppers , which in turn feed offshore birds			0
the process of kelp being washed away from the beach by outgoing tides also releases nutrients into the sand , @entity52 , who organizes a kelp festival , explained			2
however , waste management in the area take a dimmer view of the reeking weeds , with crews often scooping up the detritus and taking it away to dry in the sun. afterwards the waste material is added to other green mulch and recycled into landfill cover .			0
