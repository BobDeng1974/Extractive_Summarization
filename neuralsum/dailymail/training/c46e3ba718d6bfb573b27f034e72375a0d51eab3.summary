the ex-chief prosecutor and children ’s charities yesterday warned of ‘ injustice ’ if serial sex attackers such as @entity5 are able to hide behind a cloak of anonymity			1
@entity8 , the former @entity9 , said @entity5 ’s conviction may never have been possible if the paedophile had kept his name out of public view			1
the predator used draconian legal threats – citing the @entity16 into press standards – to pressurise newspapers into keeping the fact he was being investigated by police secret for five months			1
disclosure : @entity8 , the former @entity9 , ( left ) said @entity5 ’s conviction may never have been possible if the paedophile had kept his name out of public view the letters , sent by @entity26 solicitor @entity25 , claimed there was ‘ no public interest ’ in reporting that he had been quizzed under caution in november 2012 for allegedly sexually assaulting his daughter ’s best friend			1
the problem was compounded by the police – who @entity35 had recommended to normally keep secret the fact a suspect had been arrested – refusing to identify @entity5			1
it was only after journalists finally reported his arrest , in april the following year , that a string of other victims came forward to say they had also been indecently assaulted			0
prosecutor @entity45 told the trial this evidence was crucial in proving the case against @entity5 by demonstrating his ‘ persistent pattern of sexual offending ’			1
yesterday sir @entity8 , who advised on the decision to charge @entity5 in august 2013 , said the publicity of his arrest had been crucial			1
he said : ‘ it ’s very difficult for victims of sexual abuse to come forward in ordinary circumstances			0
it ’s particularly difficult where there is a celebrity involved because very often victims feel they simply are not going to be believed against someone such as @entity5			1
‘ it was exactly the same with @entity66 – very few victims did come forward in that case , they felt they could n’t take @entity66 on , they would n’t be believed			0
that ’s a critical part of this whole case			0
’ he told @entity73 : ‘ one of the critical things that is at the heart of this is anonymity			0
very often victims find it difficult to come forward but will come forward if they know there is another victim out there			0
’ as free speech campaigners warned of the chilling effect of @entity35 , children ’s charity the @entity84 said police had been wrong to not identify @entity5			1
historically , police forces have confirmed or denied a suspect has been arrested or interviewed under caution if asked by journalists			0
but this changed in the wake of @entity35 , which was published only days before @entity5 was first questioned under caution			2
in his report , @entity35 wrote : ‘ i think that it should be made clear that save in exceptional and clearly identified circumstances ( for example , where there may be an immediate risk to the public ) , the names or identifying details of those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the press or the public			2
draconian measures : the shamed star used legal threats to keep the fact he was being investigated by the police for five months secret			1
his legal team claimed it was not in the ' public interest ' to report the probe @entity121 , head of child protection for the @entity84 , said police should review anonymity on arrest on a case - by - case basis			1
he said : ‘ where the police believe there are multiple victims over a large period of time , i think there is a benefit of releasing the name of the accused because it encourages other victims to come forward			0
‘ when @entity66 ’s name was mentioned we were inundated			0
if the police did not say they were investigating him , would we have got any calls at all ? ’ after @entity5 was found guilty on tuesday , there was widespread alarm that @entity35 had been successfully used by the ‘ @entity143 ’ entertainer to buy five months of secrecy			1
author and free speech campaigner @entity145 said : ‘ do n’t say you were n’t warned : @entity5 lawyers cited @entity35 in an attempt to suppress news of arrest ’			2
@entity153 , of the @entity154 , said @entity5 was the second case where publicity in the media had ultimately helped to secure a conviction			2
upon the conviction of tv and radio presenter @entity162 for sex offences against children and women , it emerged ten of his 13 victims came forward only after his arrest was reported			0
@entity169 , founder of child abuse charity @entity170 , said : ‘ not naming suspects in cases like this is a disgrace			0
it means nobody else can come forward			0
it is protecting the perpetrators not the victims			0
’ current director of public prosecutions @entity181 said the conviction of @entity5 gave other sex abuse victims the courage to come forward and report abuse			1
asked if more women might have come forward if @entity5 ’s name had been publicised earlier , she said it was a ‘ difficult balance to draw ’			2
she said : ‘ there are arguments on both sides – some people feel that they have been named and then if no charges are brought their reputation has been tarnished			0
‘ at the same time we have seen both in @entity5 and in other cases that if victims know that people are reporting that someone has been arrested , they feel safer in coming forward			2

@entity8 said @entity5 may have *avoided* convicted if his name was hidden
predator used legal threats to keep five - month police investigation secret
