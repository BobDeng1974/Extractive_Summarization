brainy parrot is also bi-lingual and can speak @entity1 and @entity2 by @entity3 published : 06:40 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 14:31 est , 12 december 2012 a grandmother claims her parrot has saved her life after she developed a life - threatening illness that stops her breathing while asleep			1
@entity10 - @entity9 , 62 , says the bird wakes her up by frantically flapping his wings and gnawing her shoulder			1
even more astonishingly , @entity15 , a seven - year - old @entity16 , is also bi-lingual , and can speak @entity1 and @entity2 , she says			1
it can put a strain on the heart and cause serious health conditions such as stroke			1
the pensioner first noticed something was wrong in 2009 , when she brought @entity15 indoors after he was being bullied by another of her seven pet parrots			2
sleep apnoea is characterised by loud and heavy snoring , which she says alerted @entity15 to the problem			1
african grey parrot @entity15 is also bi-lingual , and can speak @entity1 and @entity2 she told @entity39 : ' i wondered why he kept sitting on my shoulder and pecking at me			1
' at first i was quite annoyed - he kept waking me up and i found it embarrassing as he would also mimic my snoring			2
' but he must have realised something was wrong and was trying to keep me awake			0
' ' he has kept me alive			0
he really is one in a million			0
' and that 's not the end of @entity15 's talents			0
the exotic bird also speaks @entity2 after learning some words from her @entity2 - born husband @entity50 - although this has led to some embarrassing moments			1
' my husband would sometimes say ' oh scheisse ' when he was on the computer , and @entity15 started saying it			0
' if visitors heard him i would pretend he was talking about how nice it was outside			0
' @entity15 , who could live to 60 , has also helped @entity10 tackle her fear of birds			1
' the other parrots are really my husbands , ' the mother - of - three said ' i will feed them if i have to but otherwise i do n't go near them			2
but with @entity15 it is different			0
he liked me straight away because i was a woman			0
' he sits on my shoulder during meal times and really likes peas and sweetcorn			0
he will be getting an extra special @entity72 box this year , he really is a darling			0
' @entity10 was diagnosed with sleep apnoea in 2009 after suffering from nocturnal incontinence			1
' i was getting up three to four times a night having wet myself			0
the @entity77 suggests the following lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of @entity80 : ' i thought that i had something wrong with my bladder and at first doctors were looking at @entity84 , but then one @entity86 doctor said it could be sleep apnoea , which i had never heard of before			1
' a visit to an overnight clinic confirmed that @entity90 did have the condition			0
@entity80 ( @entity80 ) is a potentially life - threatening sleep disorder			1
it causes a person 's airway to collapse during sleep , obstructing breathing for pauses of 10 seconds or more			1
this can occur several times in the night and leaves sufferers exhausted as it jolts them out of deep sleep			2
it also puts a strain on the heart and can lead to serious conditions including stroke			1
it also explains why the former canteen - worker had suffered with extreme tiredness for so long			2
she had found herself drifting off even when she was standing up and pitched headfirst into the coffee table			0
. as a result she had broken her nose five times along with suffering a fractured shoulder and other bumps and bruises			0
mrs @entity9 has now been prescribed a @entity120 ( @entity119 ) machine , which provides a gentle flow of air pressure through her nose using a mask			1
the air pressure prevents airway collapse , allowing her to breathe freely during sleep			2
' for the first time in a long time , i feel like i can see light at the end of the tunnel , and have got some of my mobility back after years of feeling too tired to get off the couch , ' she said			0
mrs @entity9 now uses a @entity136 cpap machine at night , which keeps her airways open she now finds she does n't nod off so often during the day , which means @entity15 can take a step back from guard duty			1
' i ’m grateful to @entity15 for keeping an eye on me , but i certainly wo n’t miss the painful alarm calls or his mocking my snoring , ' she said			0
mr @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 at @entity147 , @entity20 , who diagnosed mrs @entity9 , said : ' all too often , chronic snoring is viewed as a harmless phenomenon , albeit an extremely annoying one for the snorer ’s bed - partner			1
' but for up to one in five who do snore , the cause will be @entity80 , which if left untreated can lead to significant cardiovascular damage and hypoxia of the brain			2
' fortunately , for those of us without the helping hand of a uniquely talented parrot , there are some highly effective treatments , including lifestyle and behaviour changes , @entity119 therapy , mandibular advancement devices and surgery			2
' if you experience heavy snoring and suffer significant fatigue and tiredness , it ’s important that you report it to your doctor immediately			0
' sleep apnoea has traditionally been viewed as a male disease , but a recent study has suggested that among women aged 20 - 44 , up to one quarter now suffer from it , a figure which rises to more than half in women aged between 45 and 54 , and 75 per cent in women aged between 55 and 70			1
' more women should go and get checked , ' mrs @entity9 said			1
' i thought it was my bladder but @entity15 knew otherwise			0
i wish i had his brains			0

if she nods off during the day , her parrot @entity203 flaps and pecks to wake her up
