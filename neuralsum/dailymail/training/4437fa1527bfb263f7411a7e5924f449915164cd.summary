@entity0 is deserted today on what should be one of its busiest weekends for tourism of the year , as businesses count the cost of a four - day city shutdown after @entity9 forced people indoors			1
retailers will make heavy losses because of a shutdown on one of the last weekends before children go back to school - and one of the most popular times for tourists to visit			0

no sales : @entity27 looked deserted in @entity0 while it was on shutdown during @entity9 however @entity29 , of @entity31 's @entity30 , told @entity33 losses will be ‘ catastrophic ’ for businesses , as this weekend would have seen 10 per cent of back - to - school shopping			1
‘ it 's catastrophic because you basically lose all the volume you were going to do , ’ he said			2
‘ many people in the @entity31 are getting ready for the kids to go back to school			0
’ around 85 per cent of revenue shops would have taken this weekend will ‘ evaporate ’ , and it is especially bad because back - to - school is the year ’s second largest shopping event , he said			2
one tenth of shopping ahead of school restarting would have happened this weekend , as many parents would be taking their children on holiday for @entity51 next weekend			2
as well as lost sales , damage is an issue as flooding is a separate policy on most home insurance - so consumers will be left with less disposable income after they have spent money on repairs			1
this weekend was going to see bumper sales for retailers - until @entity9 came along			1
parents would have been shopping for children ahead of the return to school next month			0
and @entity0 was expecting to be full of tourists visiting during the summer holidays			1
but all that lost revenue will cost the city 's economy billions of dollars , experts say			1
' it ’s going to be tough , ' @entity74 , president of @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity0 , told patch			2
' we just do n’t need this after having to weather the economy			2
' the total clean - up cost through 10 @entity83 states is estimated at up to $ 13billion by @entity84 because of the widespread flooding in low - lying areas , reported @entity87			1
@entity89 professor @entity88 said up to $ 45billion of damage has been caused on the @entity83 , factoring in physical damage and the loss of two days of economic activity			1
around four million people have been left without power and more than 10,000 flights have been cancelled , while train services across the @entity83 region remain indefinitely suspended			2

the city would have required state and federal assistance and recession fears would have been heightened from a damage response cost of around one per cent of the total @entity31 output			1
governor @entity118 said he expects damages from @entity9 to run into billions of dollars along @entity122 's @entity121 coast and from inland river flooding			1

he said state damage assessments along the coast would begin on sunday afternoon but that inland damage may not become obvious until river flooding subsides as late as tuesday			0
one possible scenario was that the hurricane came ashore 50 miles east of @entity103 on @entity76 , which would have caused around $ 10billion in damage , reported the @entity134			2
if an even stronger storm with speeds of at least 111mph was to have directly hit @entity103 it could have caused $ 100billion damage , according to estimates			1
a category 3 storm could have rivalled the $ 235billion economic damage that the @entity143 earthquake and tsunami was estimated to have caused earlier this year			1
a category 4 hurricane seems physically impossible but if it was to happen in theory it could cause trillions of dollars of damage , reported the @entity134			0

this means a long - term non-functioning economy could cause a national and even global meltdown , and could make it one of the most expensive natural disasters the world has ever suffered			1
