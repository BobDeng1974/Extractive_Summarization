by @entity0 published : 16:23 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 06:14 est , 3 june 2013 the country 's 232,000 teaching assistants face the axe after ministers started talks to phase out the so - called ' mums army '			2
the @entity7 and @entity8 are considering getting rid of the classroom assistants in attempt to save some of the £ 4billion a year spent on them			1
the number of assistants , who are often used to help children with special needs , has nearly tripled since 2000 , but research has found they can have a negative impact on pupils ' results			1
expensive : scrapping teaching assistance would allow the @entity8 to hire more fully - qualified teachers studies have found that those pupils who receive help from teaching assistants make less progress than classmates of similar ability			1
reducing the number of assistants would enable schools to hire more teachers as well as reduce the @entity8 budget			2
however , any plans to scrap the helpers would likely be subject of opposition from some parents and headteachers who value the individual attention they can give to children			0
under the previous @entity40 government , the assistants were introduced to ease pressure on teachers and allow them more time to prepare for lessons and mark work			1
they earn an average of about £ 17,000 a year and often have few qualifications			1
slow progress : teaching assistant numbers have tripled since 2000 but they have not had an entirely positive effect on pupils the number of assistants has increased around three-fold from 79,000 in 2000 to around 232,000			1
@entity52 found that schools could improve value for money by cutting the number of teaching assistants and increasing class sizes			0
making savings : in the drive for austerity education secretary @entity60 has been overseeing major teaching reforms @entity64 , the think - tank 's research director , said : ' we cited a swathe of evidence that questioned the value for money of teaching assistants and demonstrated that their impact on educational outcomes for pupils was negligible			1
' we found that while they were supposed to help teachers , they were actually being allowed to take classes themselves			0
not being prepared or qualified to do those classes , they were not doing a very good job			0
' the money spent on teaching assistants would be far better spent on improving the quality of teachers			0
' but @entity87 , @entity40 mp for @entity88 and @entity89 , said : ' i fear this is just another excuse for cutting services with no regard for the real impact on the lives and opportunities of some of the neediest children			2
' the mass removal of teaching assistants would likely have to be phased in over several years with staff not being replaced or with assistants retrained as teachers			0
school budgets are ring - fenced from government cuts and head teachers can decide how to spend their budgets so changes could be difficult to implement			0
both the @entity7 and @entity8 declined to comment .			0

assistants were introduced by @entity40 , earning on average £ 17,000 a year
they appear to have a negative effect on pupils ' results
