@entity2 explorer @entity0 claimed to have found the lost city in 1940 the headline in the @entity5 was tantalisingly mysterious : ‘ @entity6 is believed located : @entity7 reports success in @entity10 exploration ’			1
if readers were a little puzzled as to the huge significance of this announcement , they were soon put right by the man who had made it			0
the date was july 12 , 1940 , and @entity2 explorer @entity0 had just emerged from the darkest jungles of @entity19 with an incredible story about what he ’d found there			1
@entity0 , a real - life @entity23 who later became a wartime @entity2 spy , had been recruited by the founder of @entity28 ’s prestigious @entity27 to try to find a mythical lost ‘ @entity6 ’ dripping in gold that had been founded by a mysterious civilisation as great as the @entity31 and the @entity32			1
adventurers had been searching for @entity6 for centuries , ever since @entity37 conquistador and explorer @entity35 conquered @entity19 in the early 16th century and heard rumours of its riches			1
but it remained hidden for hundreds of years until @entity0 insisted he had found it deep in the rain forests of @entity43 , more than 32,000 square miles of hellishly inhospitable wilderness in @entity10 and @entity45			1
he described how , armed only with a revolver and a machete , he and a companion named @entity47 had spent four months hacking their way through ‘ almost inaccessible ’ jungle , swamps , rivers and mountains before coming upon a hidden valley that contained the remains of a white - stoned , walled city			1
there , the local @entity59 told him , a long - vanished people , who were contemporaries of the @entity62 , had once worshipped a strange @entity63 whose giant statue was still buried under centuries of vegetation			2
they made bloody human sacrifices to their simian deity , then ate the victims in an act of ritualised cannibalism			0
@entity0 said that on his own brief visit he had himself seen a disturbing rite in which local natives ritually slaughtered and ate monkeys in a twisted hangover from the cult			1
to back his astonishing claims , @entity0 — who was only 29 but had already sailed around the world five times — brought back several thousand artefacts to @entity19 such as stone utensils and tiny carved monkey masks			1
a team of @entity2 and @entity10 archaeologists have announced that they have discovered the remains of what they believe to be the @entity6 , in a crater - shaped rainforest valley he never revealed the precise location of the ruined city for fear it would be looted before he could go back			1
however , he never returned and died mysteriously in 1954 , taking the secret of its location with him			2
it remained a compelling mystery , seemingly lifted from the pages of @entity101			0
generations of adventurers plunged into the jungle to search for the city , and experts dismissed @entity0 ’s discovery as a self - promoting fantasy			1
explorers who reported glimpsing the tops of white buildings peeking through the forest canopy were told they were just limestone cliffs			0
but now the sceptics may have to eat their words			0
a team of @entity2 and @entity10 archaeologists have just returned from @entity43			1
they have announced that — like @entity0 — they have discovered the remains of what they believe to be the @entity6 , in a crater - shaped rainforest valley encircled by steep mountains			1
according to the @entity126 , which accompanied the expedition , the archaeologists have surveyed and mapped ‘ extensive plazas , earthworks , mounds and an earthen pyramid belonging to a culture that thrived 1,000 years ago , and then vanished ’			2
the team also discovered a breathtaking collection of stone sculptures that had lain untouched since the city was abandoned			1
@entity137 , an archaeologist from @entity138 and team member , believes the sculptures — found at the base of the pyramid — may have been offerings to the @entity63			2
the team first found the ruins nearly three years ago during an aerial survey using a high - tech scanner that was able to pierce the jungle canopy with laser light and reveal archaeological features			2
the city had been a shrine to the monkey @entity63 akin to @entity153 's @entity63 who is pictured hiding @entity154 and @entity155 , two @entity153 deities , in his heart to protect them			2
but the @entity10 monkey @entity63 is more menacing it showed ruins that stretched for more than a mile along a river through the valley			1
the remote , rugged area is a major cocaine smuggling route and the scientists , who were ferried to the site by helicopter , were accompanied by @entity10 special forces and former members of @entity171 ’s @entity170			1
wild animals routinely wandered through their camp , clearly never having encountered humans before			0
even without excavation , the scientists found 52 artefacts sticking out from the ground with many more clearly lying in the earth and vegetation beneath			2
they included stone ceremonial seats , and finely carved vessels decorated with snakes , vultures and animal - like figures			0
the most arresting find was a viciously fanged stone head , part - man and part - beast			0
@entity137 believes it to be not a ‘ were - wolf ’ but a spirit - like ‘ were - jaguar ’ — the giant cat still prowls the jungles — representing a priest in a transformed state			2
the ancient culture that created the city , say the scientists , is so little known that it does n’t even have a proper name — although @entity0 called its people the @entity204			1
he was just one of many men to search for the ruins after the aviator @entity207 reportedly claimed that he saw the expansive white remains of an ‘ amazing ancient metropolis ’ when he flew over the region in 1927			1
in the @entity212 , @entity211 , multi-millionaire founder of @entity28 ’s @entity27 , paid for two expeditions to find it led by a pith - helmeted fellow of the @entity216 named capt r. @entity217			0
he found nothing except dark rumours that the natives were ‘ devil worshippers ’ who spoke of a lost ‘ @entity6 ’			1
the @entity222 and @entity224 team produced this 3d digital topological map which when examined shows a man - made plaza ringed in red and there was another myth — that the @entity63 had produced offspring , a half - man and half - simian race dubbed the ‘ hairy people ’			0
locals believed apes from the jungle had long ago stolen virgins from their villages to produce the mongrel offspring ; they also insisted the ruins were cursed			0
@entity0 was the leader of mr @entity211 ’s third expedition and , as he explained later , after months of starvation , sickness and exhaustion , they were about to give up when he saw something from the top of a small cliff			1
it was the stone ruins of a walled ‘ great city			2
that at its height must have held many thousands of inhabitants ’ , he wrote			0
the jungle - choked city walls originally would have risen , he estimated , to 30ft and on almost everything he found , said @entity0 , was carved the likeness of a monkey			1
while they were there , he said , real spider monkeys peered curiously at the expedition ’s team from the trees above			0
although the vegetation was too thick to see much , local guides showed him a huge mound they said lay at the centre of the city			2
buried deep within was an enormous temple with a vast staircase leading to a ‘ high stone dais on which was the statue of the @entity63 himself ’			2
this , they claimed , had been ‘ the place of sacrifice ’			2
locals believed apes from the jungle had stolen virgins from their villages to produce mongrel offspring as to what had been sacrificed , @entity0 and ethnologists he consulted were convinced the people had practised a barbaric tradition that was later adopted by the warlike @entity31 to the north in @entity290			1
every year , a physically perfect young man , usually a priest , would be selected to be the @entity63 for that year			0
he would be worshipped , pampered and given the most beautiful girls			0
but after 12 months , he would be ritually slaughtered at the top of the pyramid temple , his heart torn out and his body thrown down the steps where it would be cut into pieces			0
priests would distribute it among the worshippers who would each take a small piece home to eat			0
one night @entity0 watched a group of natives perform a morbid ritual dance in which each of them brandished a spear on which were impaled three spider monkeys			1
the monkeys were roasted over a fire in such a way that their limbs contracted and writhed in the flames as if still alive , and the whole tribe settled down later to eat them			0
officiating was the local head medicine man or shaman — the @entity322			0
naked except for a loincloth and his body painted with white chalk , he made a blood - curdling spectacle with a necklace laced with the minute skulls of unborn monkeys , yellow human teeth and the poison sacks of lethal jungle snakes			0
adventurers had been searching for @entity6 for centuries , ever since @entity37 conquistador and explorer @entity35 conquered @entity19 in the early 16th century and heard rumours of it to his fingertips he had fixed the fangs of huge alligators			1
at one point he brandished a long arrow on which was impaled a large spider monkey			0
at another , he stuck a hollow bamboo rod into the eye socket of each roasted monkey , ritually sucking out their brain fluid			0
was this monstrous man the spiritual successor to the chief priest of the @entity63 ? the natives said the ceremony was a dance of revenge for the theft by monkeys of their virgins all those years ago			0
@entity0 spent just two days at the ruins because the monsoon season started suddenly , forcing him to leave the place before conducting any excavations which might have enabled him to prove his theories			2
only now , with this new expedition , does it look like his discovery may finally be verified			0
and if the @entity6 really is cursed , as the natives had warned @entity0 , he may have belatedly paid the price			1
he committed suicide in circumstances that have never been satisfactorily explained .			0

@entity2 explorer @entity0 claimed he had found mythical lost city
adventurers had been searching for @entity6 for centuries
in 1940 @entity0 went exploring the remote jungles of @entity19
when he returned he said he *'d* found it deep in the rain forests of @entity43
now archaeologists have announced they have discovered the remains of what they believe to be the @entity6 in @entity10 rainforest
