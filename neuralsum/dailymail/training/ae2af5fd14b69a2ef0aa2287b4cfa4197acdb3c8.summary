former @entity1 vice president @entity0 said wednesday that he was ' stunned ' to hear president @entity2 during his speech to the @entity4 making an ' outrageous ' comparison between a white - on - black police shooting in @entity7 and a mass genocide by the @entity10 terror army in @entity11 and @entity12			1
' i was stunned , ' @entity0 said during a @entity15 interview			1
' i mean , in one case you 've got a police officer involved in a shooting			0
there may be questions about it			0
they 'll be sorted out through the legal process			0
' ' there 's no comparison to that with what @entity10 is doing to thousands of people throughout the @entity31 , ' he said , ' with bloody beheadings of anybody they come in contact with			0
' @entity0 said it 's ' outrageous ' to compare @entity37 with @entity11 ' as though somehow there 's moral equivalence there ' ' we have our own racial and ethnic tensions ' : @entity2 brought the august shooting in @entity37 , @entity7 into his speech condemning @entity10 terrorists for a genocidal march across parts of @entity11 and @entity12 @entity50 's police - shooting death followed his participation in a convenience - story robbery , but civil rights protesters descended on the town of @entity37 , @entity7 to demand the cop 's prosecution @entity2 had said hours earlier at a @entity58 meeting in @entity59 that the august 9 shooting of @entity50 in @entity37 , @entity7 was evidence that the @entity1 has ' our own racial and ethnic tensions			1
' @entity50 , 18 , committed a strong - arm robbery at a convenience store before a physical altercation with a police officer , which turned deadly minutes later critics quickly jumped on @entity2 's comment , saying the president was drawing lines of similarity between the teen 's death and the ethnic cleansing plaguing the @entity31			1
@entity74 , formerly the spokesman for @entity1 's @entity4 mission , wrote wednesday in an online essay that ' overstating @entity1 's issues does n't make us relatable ; it makes others ' issues easily dismissable			1
' @entity2 had offered what some interpreted as an apology on the world stage for a local law - enforcement crisis that left a single man dead			2
' i realize that @entity1 's critics will be quick to point out that at times we too have failed to live up to our ideals , that @entity1 has plenty of problems within our own borders , ' he told world leaders , referring to the shooting			1
' in a summer marked by instability in the @entity31 and @entity99 , i know the world also took notice of the small @entity1 city of @entity37 , @entity7 â€“ where a young man was killed , and a community was divided			2
so yes , we have our own racial and ethnic tensions			2
' former vice president @entity0 said wednesday night that he was ' stunned ' to hear president @entity2 bring the @entity37 , @entity7 police shooting into a speech about @entity10 terrorism and genocide fair comparison ? the murderous @entity114 terror group @entity10 has mass - slaughtered fellow @entity115 for the crime of belonging to the wrong religious sect the case brought @entity1 race - rioters to @entity7 from as far away as @entity120 and @entity121			1
@entity37 was the scene of looting and nightly riots			0
@entity0 appeared on the ' @entity126 ' program			0
later in his interview , he said @entity2 would eventually have to heed calls for @entity1 ground troops to intervene in @entity12 and @entity11 , where the self - described @entity10 ( @entity10 ) has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions in its quest for a ' caliphate ' state ruled by religious extremists			1
the president , @entity0 said , repeatedly refuses to ' accept good military advice in terms of how he actually uses the force			2
' in part because of that , the former vp said , the next decade will see another bloody terror attack on @entity1 soil			0
' it 's not just @entity10			0
@entity10 front and center right now , ' he said			0
' but i believe there 'll be another mass casualty attack against the @entity1			2

former @entity139 said he was ' stunned ' to hear the president invoke a police shooting as evidence that the @entity1 has ethnic tensions
@entity2 's move was *widely* *slammed* by critics who believe he was equating a single slain teen with *victims* of a mass - genocide
' there 's no comparison , ' @entity0 said on the @entity15
@entity2 had told the @entity4 that ' @entity1 has plenty of problems within our own borders ' and ' our own racial and ethnic tensions '
no charges have been brought against the white police who killed @entity50 , a black 18 - year - old who had just robbed a store but was *unarmed*
