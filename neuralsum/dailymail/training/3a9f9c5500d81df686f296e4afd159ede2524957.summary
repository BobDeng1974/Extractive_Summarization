by @entity0 published : 16:57 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 01:08 est , 31 january 2014 @entity2 are in talks over a £ 35million deal to sign @entity5 centre back @entity7 and his team - mate @entity8			1
they may struggle to pull off the double transfer before friday ’s 11pm deadline but @entity2 are determined to seal the deals no later than this summer			2
they have been encouraged by a significant shift in @entity5 ’s position over the last 48 hours after the cash - strapped @entity17 club indicated they are willing to reduce the asking price if it means having the money in the bank now			0
top targets : @entity8 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) could join @entity2 before the transfer deadline hitting the heights : @entity26 @entity7 has been tracked by @entity2 for some time city have been tracking @entity7 , 22 , for some time knowing the buyout clause in the @entity26 ’s contract is £ 37.8m			1
@entity5 value @entity8 , 26 , at £ 7m even though the defensive midfielder from @entity31 will be a free agent in the summer			2
however , it is understood that a joint figure of £ 35m could be agreed if @entity2 are prepared to do business before friday 's deadline			0
that would be another remarkable statement of intent by @entity41 ’s side , who have taken the @entity43 by storm after spending more than £ 100m on new signings last summer			2
@entity7 has interested a number of top clubs including @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , but @entity41 identified the former @entity52 defender as his top target some time ago			1
the city manager has been in the hunt for a new centre back since last summer , when he failed to sign @entity57 from @entity58 and then compromised by bringing in @entity59 from neighbours @entity60			1
the uncertainty over the @entity7 deal is believed to be the reason why @entity65 ’s future at @entity2 has been left in the balance			1
a deal is in place for @entity65 to join @entity69 , with the @entity71 defender desperate for regular first - team football to safeguard his @entity74 hopes			1
equally , the bid for @entity8 will cast further doubt over the @entity2 futures of @entity78 and @entity79 , neither of whom has impressed since arriving in 2012			2
wanted : @entity7 has shown his talents this season with the @entity17 giants in tow ? @entity8 ( right ) could be on his way to the @entity88 for £ 7million strengthening : @entity41 ( left ) is hoping to bolster his defensive options at @entity2 future partner ? @entity91 may be lining up alongside @entity7 in the @entity2 back line meanwhile , @entity41 is set to be without top scorer @entity92 for monday ’s match with @entity49 at the @entity88 after the @entity95 striker limped out of wednesday ’s 5 - 1 win at @entity97 with a hamstring injury			1
@entity92 could face a race to be fit for the @entity101 showdown with @entity102 next month			1
uncertainty : @entity65 ( right ) could be on his way out if the pair join from @entity5 the competition : @entity59 ( left ) and @entity106 ( right ) have been rotated this season at £ 28million , @entity7 seems rather pricey for an unknown centre half currently playing in @entity17 ? maybe , but believe it or not , @entity2 are getting him on the cheap			1
the 22 - year - old ’s buy - out clause at @entity5 is £ 37.8m , and only the attraction of up - front cash from @entity112 is persuading them to let him go for less			0
he began his career with @entity52 in @entity115 — is @entity91 set to welcome a fellow countryman to the @entity88 ? no , @entity7 is actually @entity26			2
born in the @entity119 suburb of @entity120 , his family moved to @entity115 when he was five to live in the @entity26 - speaking town of @entity122			0
@entity7 qualified for a @entity115 passport , but elected to answer a call - up from @entity126 ’s under 21 squad after making his name at @entity128 , and won his first full cap in a friendly against @entity131 last june , two years after his £ 6.5m move to @entity5			1
he ’s used to moving around then ? yes , off and on the pitch			0
he began life as a striker growing up in @entity115 , but switched to left back when he joined @entity52			0
he then shone as a deep - lying midfielder , but eventually ended up as a stylish central defender			0
does he have any previous experience of @entity140 football ? he certainly does			0
at the age of just 18 , @entity7 scored @entity52 ’s first ever @entity101 goal , in september 2009 , against @entity143			0
he ’s been on the radar of the @entity43 ’s big boys ever since			0

title *chasers* hope to bring in @entity7 and team - mate @entity8
move for @entity7 could see @entity65 join @entity69
@entity41 has wanted a centre back since *missing* out on @entity57
race to tie up duo before window shuts at 11pm on friday
@entity92 faces race to be fit for @entity159 tie
