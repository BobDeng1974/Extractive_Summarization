the now defunct @entity10 admitted hacking the 13 - year - old ’s mobile phone but it remains unknown whether two missing messages were deleted deliberately , as previously suggested , or were removed from her message box automatically			2
tributes : @entity17 ( left ) stands with @entity45 and @entity46 , @entity36 's parents , who said because her voicemail messages disappeared they believed she was alive - in fact her her phone had been hacked the @entity51 into press standards has heard that @entity36 ’s mother @entity53 phoned her daughter repeatedly in march 2002 after she vanished while walking home in @entity56 , @entity20			1
the teenager ’s voicemail message was a generic automated response when her message box was full but when a message had been deleted the greeting reverted to her personal greeting			0

animal : @entity72 abducted and murdered the 13 - year - old after she walked past his home @entity34 themselves reported them to the @entity16 but they are still on active duty for the force			2

' the @entity16 has told @entity108 that they still plan to hand their report over to @entity20 's chief constable , @entity110 , before the end of the year , but the @entity16 claims that it is unlikely that it will be made public until 2014 - 18 months more than expected			1
