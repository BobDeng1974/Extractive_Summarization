two @entity0 put aside their political differences in august and spent a week together on a deserted island with no fresh water last month for a reality tv show that will air on the @entity5 in october			1
the one - episode series called @entity7 will feature @entity10 @entity9 @entity8 and @entity12 democrat @entity11 marooned in the @entity13 for six days and six nights			1
the purpose of the dramatic week - long getaway , the senators said in a statement , was to prove that bipartisanship is n't dead			1
sens. @entity8 , left , and @entity11 , right , attempt to start a fire while surviving on the remote @entity23 island , part of the @entity13 , for the @entity5 's @entity7			1
the two @entity26 senators from opposite sides of the political aisle spent a week marooned together on a remote island for the new reality show @entity9 sen. @entity8 is pictured on the left speaking to reporters in the @entity33 in november			1
sen. @entity11 , a @entity11 from @entity12 , is pictured on the right arriving in the @entity33 for a vote in april ' both of us know just how frustrated people are with @entity38 right now			1
we can both attest that no one is more frustrated than those of us trying to get things done in this environment , ' they said			0
' so we decided to do something completely out of the ordinary and frankly a little extreme to show the world and our colleagues that even if you have serious differences , if you want to survive you have to work together			0
' the two freshman senators secretly filmed the adventure on the island of @entity23 while @entity52 was in recess last month			1
@entity8 , who is an experienced survivalist , told the @entity54 on thursday that he and @entity11 had originally planned to shoot the documentary themselves and have someone else produce it for them			1
' then we approached @entity59 because they have a number of survivor shows and they said , well , we like the idea but how about you let us come film it ? ' @entity8 said			1
a description of the show released by @entity59 says that the ' unusual pairing will leave behind the daily life of congressional staff , senate hearings and committee meetings to navigate the rigors of surviving on an isolated island with no contact with the outside world to call upon for help			2
sen. @entity8 has marooned himself in the @entity13 twice before in 2009 and and 2013			1
the second time he took his teenage sons , @entity82 , left , and @entity83 , right , with him at their urging ' using only these limited resources and their wits ' the unlikely allies must work together ' to spear fish , build shelter and find enough water to survive for one week			2
' ' there is no natural source for fresh water on @entity95 , and what lives in the ocean will be their major food source , ' the statement says			0
while the survivor - style show is an oddity , @entity8 is no amateur at playing house on a deserted island , having stranded himself in the @entity13 on two other occasions in the last five years			1
in august of 2009 , when he was still serving in the @entity104 , @entity8 spent a week alone on the island of @entity106			1
excerpts of a diary the congressman kept during his time on the island revealed that the @entity112 had been dreaming of being a castaway since he was a child			2
' i have the best job in the world , but still the islands beckon , ' he said in a section printed in the @entity54			0
' no food , just mask , fins and a pole - spear to obtain it			0
no water , only a manual desalination pump to create fresh water , ' @entity8 wrote			2
' no matches , only a magnifying glass			0
and a hammock , knife , hatchet , sunscreen , cooking pot and salt and pepper			0
oh , and a satellite phone and @entity138 beacon should i eat the wrong fish and a @entity141 pen to scrawl a desperate message for rescuers			0
' @entity8 again snuck off to the string of islands in the @entity146 last year over @entity147 weekend - that time at the behest of his two teenage sons , @entity82 and @entity83 , who he 'd promised to take on a their own after his @entity0 campaign concluded			1
the trio spent the holiday weekend on the island of @entity154 together			0
' we came back a little thinner			0
we had an awesome time , it was great , ' @entity8 told the @entity54 after that trip			2
' for a dad it was a wonderful thing			0
no video games around , no television , no distractions , no texting , ' @entity8 said			2
' to just sit there and pump water , that was my favorite time , frankly , on the island			0
just to have no distractions			0
' @entity8 and his sons filmed the experience and released a video of their travels afterward			1
for his third trip , @entity8 took a friend from across the aisle and an experienced camera crew to catch it all on camera			2
rival survival will air on the @entity5 on october 29 at 10 pm , six days before the mid-term elections			0
' whoever is going to lead the @entity0 going forward is going to do so with a very slim margin , ' @entity8 told the @entity54			2
' the parties are going to need to work together , so we wanted to get this out before the election , now â€™s a good time to show it			0
