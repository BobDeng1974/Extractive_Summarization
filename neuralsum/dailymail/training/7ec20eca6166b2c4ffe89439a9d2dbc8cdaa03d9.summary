published : 09:56 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 15:24 est , 7 august 2012 a shocking new attack ad from the @entity2 camp blames @entity3 for a woman 's cancer death after her husband 's steel mill in @entity8 , @entity9 , went bankrupt under @entity10			1
the commercial , called ' understands ' , is perhaps the harshest attack on the @entity14 presidential candidate to date			0
in the video , released online on tuesday , steel worker @entity15 says @entity3 does n't know what his private equity firm did to workers , ' and further , i do n't think he 's concerned			1
' in a separate attack , the president also tarred @entity3 as ' @entity23 in reverse ' for his economic plan that the @entity2 campaign says gives $ 5trillion in tax cuts to the wealthy at the expense of poor and middle class families			1
@entity2 can officially disavow the attack by saying it was produced by an independent group , but the pac is run by two former @entity43 aides and close allies			0
mr @entity15 worked for @entity45 , which was purchased by @entity3 's private equity firm @entity10			1
the company later went bankrupt and 750 workers lost their jobs , though @entity10 investors made millions of dollars off the deal			0
@entity3 says the steel mill only went under after he left @entity10			2
@entity2 's campaign says the investment in @entity55 is fair game because the initial deal was struck while @entity3 was still at the helm			2
in the ad , mr @entity15 says his wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer after he was cut from his job and lost health insurance for his family			1
' i do n’t know how long she was sick , and i think maybe she did n’t say anything because she knew that we could n’t afford the insurance , ' he says			0
dispute : @entity3 's experience at @entity10 has been a source of exhaustive attacks by the @entity2 campaign in an effort to discredit the @entity14 challenger ' one day she became ill and i took her up to the @entity79 hospital and admitted her for pneumonia and that 's when they found the cancer			2
by then it was stage four , there was nothing they could do for her and she passed away in 22 days			0
' mr @entity15 ends the ad by saying : ' i do not think @entity3 realizes what he ’s done to anyone , and furthermore i do not think @entity3 is concerned			1
' @entity3 's campaign blasted the new spot as ' discredited , dishonest attacks			2
' a spokesman says @entity2 is trying to distract the @entity98 people from the sluggish economy and high unemployment rates			0
perhaps not surprisingly , the ad stand on very shaky ground , factually			0
the steel company was acquired by @entity10 while @entity3 was at the helm , though it did not close until 2001 -- two years after @entity3 says he left the company			0
mr @entity15 's wife dined in 2006 , five years after the plant shut down			1
controversy : many of the campaign volleys have centered around whether @entity10 created more jobs than it destroyed the @entity112 has raised $ 20.7million as of june 30 and spent more than $ 17million on ads attacking @entity3			0
@entity114 , @entity3 's super pac run two former aides , has raised $ 62million and spent $ 8.2million opposing @entity2 so far			2
it also spent nearly $ 40million bashing @entity3 's @entity14 primary challengers and $ 14million support the former @entity118 governor			0
on monday @entity2 blasted @entity3 for his economic plan , which he says will raise taxes on the middle class and poor to pay for a $ 5trillion deduction for wealthy @entity98			1
' it 's like @entity23 in reverse -- it 's @entity3 - hood , ' he said .			1
