by @entity0 published : 05:04 est , 23 may 2012 updated : 01:43 est , 24 may 2012 thousands of screaming fans mobbed @entity3 star @entity2 as he carried the @entity5 flame through @entity6 this afternoon			1
the footballer waved at supporters as he jogged through the town centre with the torch and many of those who turned out to see him were wearing @entity3 shirts			1
@entity2 emerged from the pedestrianised @entity14 where fans had gathered to catch a glimpse of the star			0
the footballer , who was the 84th torchbearer of the day , ran down @entity17 in @entity6 's bustling shopping district			1
@entity2 was flanked by police and security as he handed over the flame to @entity39 , chairman of @entity40 , a community multi-sport venue owned by @entity41			2
as the two torches touched , spectators ran towards @entity2 to get a photo of the footballer			2
he was then quickly whisked through the crowd into a silver car and driven away			0
while the footballer was whisked away , there was drama shortly after he had passed the torch on when a 16 - year - old youth attempted to grab the flame as it passed			1
the teenager was rugby - tackled by a security guard after getting within 2ft of the torch as it made its way down @entity59 in the town			1
the youth was then bundled into the crowd before he was chased down the street and detained by officers at the scene			2
a spokesman for the force revealed he was not arrested - but taken home to his parents and given a word of advice			0
eyewitness @entity72 , 20 , who was watching the relay with sister @entity74 , six , looked on in horror as the @entity5 flame was almost seized by the rampaging yob			1
the sociology student , from @entity6 , said : ' the guy came from the left of me and ran out into the road - he got about two - feet from the torch			1
drama : this is the moment an unidentified youth attempted to attack the @entity87 as it passed through @entity6			1
the man was bundled into the crowd and detained by officers , before being given ' a word of advice ' ' but a security guard tackled him and threw him back into the crowd - narrowly missing my sister			2
he landed on top of a four - year - old child			0
' he then tried to run off but was eventually caught by police and arrested			0
it was a really shocking thing to witness - the torch was under attack			2
' @entity2 , who plays for the @entity103 striker , scored the equaliser and then the winning penalty in saturday 's dramatic @entity107 final win over @entity108 , announced yesterday he was quitting @entity3 to pursue his career elsewhere			1
he departs @entity110 with his reputation as one of the club 's greatest players firmly intact , but he knows it could have been so much different			2
ever since the 34 - year - old joined the club from @entity120 in 2004 they have been chasing the @entity107 and , after so many near misses , @entity2 's final kick for them earned them the prize they coveted			2
had he not have scored and had @entity108 gone on to win , he admits he may have been tempted to stay but , with all his loose ends tied up , he is moving on to a new chapter			0
explosive : the torchbearer is greeted by fireworks as they run across @entity130 's iconic @entity129 honour : @entity132 carries the @entity5 flame over the @entity129 during the leg between @entity135 and @entity136 long way to go : after arriving it he @entity138 last friday , the @entity87 is now on day five of its 70 - day relay speaking to @entity141 , he said : ' i think winning the game was the key			1
not me scoring the penalty			0
' winning the game was the turning point , that 's why i have decided to say goodbye			2
' we made the story together and i want people to remember that			0
this is the best time to move on			0
' yes , there 's a chance that if the result was different , maybe i would be here			2
' we were talking for many weeks , but the turning point was based on the fact i won everything i could and scored in most of the finals we have played , trying to make a difference			0
' i hope everyone will understand			0
everything i did was for the fans and i hope they understand			0
' earlier today , the @entity5 torch took a wrong turn in @entity130 , delaying the relay by 10 minutes			1
however , once the convoy got back on track it sparked a spectacular fireworks display as the torchbearer passed over the city 's iconic @entity129			1
the torch left the foggy streets of @entity130 for @entity177 at 5.50am before travelling by convoy to visit @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181			1
but as it returned to @entity130 via @entity179 the convoy took a wrong turn in @entity135			1
moment to shine : @entity183 carries the @entity5 flame on the leg between @entity130 and @entity179 proud procession : @entity187 with the torch			1
tens of thousands of people had lined the streets of @entity130 to catch a glimpse of the flame tens of thousands of people had lined the streets of @entity130 to catch a glimpse of the flame			1
@entity129 was left suspiciously empty but all became clear when @entity132 stepped on to the grade i - listed structure and the loud bang of fireworks was heard			1
ms @entity132 won badminton gold at the 1998 @entity203 as part of the women 's @entity205 could be heard from the crowd as people cheered and waved @entity209			0
the display followed the torchbearer as she ran across the bridge to loud applause from spectators			0

they realised straight away and rectified it			0
' they were running 10 minutes late			1

' it was in convoy travelling from @entity179 to @entity135			0
' now watch the videos			0
