emergency workers have played down fears of a toxic air leak following the fertilizer plant explosion in @entity4 , @entity5			1
initially reports suggested the farming community would be under a secondary danger of inhaling ammonia fumes which can cause respiratory problems			1
however , @entity12 police chief @entity11 , who is leading the operation on behalf of the town of @entity4 which is 20 miles away , says he now believes that danger has been mitigated			1
police say now say the leak is under control air pollution : a cloud of fumes can be seen rising from the massive explosion at a fertilizer plant in the @entity30 state of @entity5 which flattened several buildings according to popular science anhydrous ammonia is a widely used form of fertilizer			1
it is compressed into a clear , colorless liquid and stored at extremely low temperatures and stored in tanks - when injected into the soil it ' is a potent way of making the soil more fertile ' - once outside it reverts to its natural gas state so it can be inhaled causing damage to the lungs - the ' anhydrous ' portion of its name means ' without water ' and refers to the fact that it reacts with water			1
it is dangerous to humans when it makes contact with water in the body like in the lungs and eyes - anyone suffering from ammonia irritation will need to flush the area with water to dilute the chemical - untreated in large quantities it can damage lung lining which is incredibly dangerous and can lead to death - the website says the gas would n't have been the cause of the fire but would have exacerbated an initial blaze leading to the explosion			1
according to reports there was 54,000 pounds of it at the plant in @entity4 ' the town is secure			2
there are plenty of law enforcement officials that are stationed around the town , ' @entity11 said			1
' there is no fire out of control			2
there is no chemical escape from the fertilizer plant that is out of control			1
' ' air quality , at this point , is not an issue			0
it is not a concern			0
' last night authorities were concerned about a possible gas cloud creeping across the area from the blaze			2
the @entity100 deployed a ' large investigation team ' to the scene and the @entity103 began monitoring air in the area			0
gov. @entity106 said the air was being constantly monitored and gas distribution has been disconnected			2
' we are â€¦ gathering information as details continue to emerge about this incident , ' he said			0
' we have also mobilized state resources to help local authorities			0
our thoughts and prayers are with the people of @entity4 , and the first responders on the scene			0
' locals reported a strong chemical smell after last night 's explosion which occurred just before 8pm and doctors reported some people had irritated eyes and respiratory issues as a result of the fumes			0
dangers : what @entity130 can do if it makes contact with the body			0

toxic fumes from the blaze are ' under control ' according to police chief @entity11
blast is thought to have been caused by the *ignition* of dangerous anhydrous ammonia at the plant
if gas is inhaled it can cause eye irritation and damage the lungs
