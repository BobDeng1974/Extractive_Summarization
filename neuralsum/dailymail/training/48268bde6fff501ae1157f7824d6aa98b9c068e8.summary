@entity86 , chairman of the @entity87 and a former state school history teacher and headmaster of a successful prep school , said : ‘ schools should be safe and secure places for staff and pupils			0
' where violence reigns , self - preservation , not education , is the order of the day			2
the fact is there are few deterrents for delinquent kids			0
former headteacher @entity86 , said that while violence is coming into schools , self - preservation gets in the way of education ‘ a child who is a danger to others in school should be educated in an isolation unit until we can be fairly sure that he or she no longer poses a threat			0
’ the greatest number of violent incidents at schools during the 2012/13 academic year – by both adults and children – was in @entity30 which had 112 , followed by 14 in the @entity121			1

‘ that is why we have put teachers back in charge of discipline			0
teachers can now issue no - notice detentions , search pupils without consent for weapons , and use force to remove disruptive pupils from the classroom			0

in the last year 594 incidents were reported by 57 @entity61 councils
however only a third of local *authorities* keep track of this data
