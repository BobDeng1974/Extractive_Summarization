courageous : @entity1 of @entity2 , pictured with prince @entity3 and their son @entity4 , had the perfect birth she was hoping for @entity1 of @entity2 delivered her son perfectly – without recourse to any powerful painkillers			1
the @entity10 has learned that @entity11 had a completely natural birth after arriving at the @entity13 of @entity14 , @entity15 , just after 5.30am last monday			1
as four midwives monitored the as - yet unborn baby , the @entity17 ’s former gynaecologist watched closely behind the glass of the £ 5,000 - a - night suite			1
assisted by two other top medics , @entity23 – who delayed his retirement to oversee the birth of the third in line to the @entity27 – made sure the birthing plan went without a hitch			1
@entity11 ’s calm demeanour once @entity4 was in her arms – and the gentle support of her husband @entity3 – truly moved the seven - strong medical team			1
although the @entity37 was in labour for 11 hours , sources in @entity36 have told @entity10 that she opted not to have powerful painkillers			1
the precise sequence of events in the delivery room will always remain a closely guarded secret for those present – and they have refused all requests for interview			2
but the family of neonatologist dr @entity47 , who was on hand to check the health of the newborn prince , have told of their pride that their treasured son helped deliver a future @entity55			2
at their home in a @entity60 suburb , dr @entity47 ’s closest relatives spoke of the honour he had brought to the family			2
when his family phoned dr @entity47 the day after the birth , they congratulated him on his role			1
his eldest brother @entity66 said : ‘ the first thing we told him was that we were so proud of him			2
’ as he spoke , dr @entity47 ’s 82 - year - old mother , @entity71 , who lives in the less fashionable east side of @entity60 ’s @entity74 suburb , glowed with pride			1
dressed in an immaculate white sari with gold , red and pale blue details , @entity71 smiled broadly as she explained : ‘ when we spoke to @entity80 on the phone , he said he just did the delivery with the other doctors and it was normal			2
‘ we have had so many friends and relatives calling because everyone is very happy			2
’ @entity71 said that she spoke to her son , he was modesty personified			2
though her son has just helped to deliver the new prince , she confessed that she knew little about the @entity90			2
even so , the moment the birth was announced , her friends and neighbours started ringing to congratulate her , she said			1
‘ his ambition was always to be a doctor , ’ said his mother			2
‘ he would play games of doctors and patients			0
he was very clever at school and always winning competitions			0
’ newborn : @entity11 was in labour for 11 hours before giving birth to @entity4 , pictured @entity107 , the youngest of three brothers , is married to another doctor and the couple , who live in @entity112 , have a son and a daughter			1
as his family clustered around the phone at their home in @entity60 , almost 5,000 miles from the @entity36 hospital , dr @entity47 told them of his joy at helping the delivery			0
the consultant did not disclose any confidential medical details , but said he had been honoured to take part in such a historic occasion			1
‘ he said it was very exciting and he was so happy , ’ said his brother @entity66 , 54			0
the medical team had been meticulously preparing for the delivery for a month			1
experts : @entity1 had a top team on hand to help her through the birth including gynaecologists @entity23 ( centre ) and @entity138 ( right ) it is understood from sources that there were no problems , no scares , no alarms , and everything went according to plan			1
the medical team who helped @entity11 through the birth was overseen by mr @entity23			1
@entity1 was also monitored by a team of midwives throughout her labour			1
@entity153 , professor of midwifery at the @entity154 , led the team , which also featured @entity156 , a married mother of two from @entity158 , @entity159 , from @entity160 , @entity161 , and @entity162 , from @entity158			1
all three had to cover shifts over a 24 - hour period and had been on stand - by in case the @entity1 went into premature labour			1
top facility : @entity1 was rushed to the @entity169 of @entity14 where she gave birth to @entity4 on monday evening when @entity4 was born it is believed that ms @entity159 was the midwife on duty , although @entity173 was also in the room for the textbook delivery			1
the others there to share the joyous moment were mr @entity23 , his assistant consultant obstetrician , @entity180 , and dr @entity47			0
dr @entity47 is a specialist in complex and high - risk births , and it was his job to check @entity4 ’s health the instant he was delivered			1
dr @entity47 ’s middle brother , @entity187 , 52 , described him as the ‘ intelligent one of the family ’			0
‘ he was always very sincere about what he was doing , ’ said @entity187 , who runs a car rental business			0
dr @entity47 studied paediatrics in @entity192 before becoming a neonatologist			0
‘ he has delivered a lot of babies in his time but he was the happiest person when he did this one , ’ said @entity187			0
@entity66 said their late father worked as a neighbourhood official for the @entity60 municipal corporation			0
it was a well - respected position , he said , but his brother was the one who had really made good			1
‘ @entity80 was a very clever student			0
his wife is a doctor , and their son wants to become one too , ’ @entity187 added			0
dr @entity47 and his family moved to the @entity208 ten years ago but return to @entity192 once a year to visit family , said @entity66			1
‘ @entity80 likes the @entity208 and the people are good			0
he is a big fan of the @entity90 and we are so proud of him for what he has done			0
’ one hospital insider said last night : ‘ @entity215 is quite brilliant but is the last person who would wish to appear on tv			0
that ’s just not his personality			0
his skills in treating sick babies , however , are renowned			0
’ the @entity37 and @entity1 ’s spokesman declined to make any comment about ‘ such a private moment ’			0
i gave birth to my sons @entity228 and @entity229 on the @entity169 and , like @entity11 , was under the care of obstetrician @entity180			1
so i understand how @entity11 stayed so serene in the glare of all those cameras when she leftst @entity233 ’s			0
mr @entity180 is so calm and reassuring , and that transmits to his patients			1
safe hands : @entity237 and her daughter @entity238 in the @entity169 with newborn @entity229 my son @entity228 , whom mr @entity180 delivered in 2002 , was by far my easiest birth – even though he was born on @entity241 ! it was so noisy with fireworks going off outside , but mr @entity245 a dedicated chef was on hand to whip up delicious meals for patients and guests			1
@entity180 kept me calm – even joking that @entity228 would be a noisy child because of the fireworks			2
the @entity169 has eight bedrooms , all with separate bathrooms and a separate delivery room			0
the wing has recently been refurbished , but when i was there , it was quite standard : a metal bed and ordinary cotton sheets			0
there was a special @entity169 - branded washbag filled with toiletries in the bathroom and a dedicated chef was on hand to whip up delicious meals for patients and guests			2
i was shown how to breastfeed properly , how to bathe the baby and how to change a nappy			0
and a physiotherapist taught me pelvic floor and tummy exercises – all part of the wonderful service			0
my husband @entity273 and i had decided to go private for safety reasons			0
@entity273 ’s aunt was starvedof oxygen at birth , born disabled and died at 12			2
so , yes , it cost £ 5,000 even back in 2002 – but what price your children ’s health ?			0
