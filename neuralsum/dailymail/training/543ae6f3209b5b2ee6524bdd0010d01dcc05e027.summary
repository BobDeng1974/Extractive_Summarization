there seems to be no logic in it			0
‘ in fact it sends out a message that people can go out and kill someone and then get away with it by saying they ca n’t remember doing it			2
‘ the judge seemed more bothered about the defendant ’s life and the devastation it will have on him and his family			0

' passing sentence , judge @entity9 told @entity10 : ' you are suffering from post accident amnesia and you have no recollection of the accident itself			1
' but , in my judgement , a major factor must have been the amount of stress you must have been under at that time			0
in particular , the news that you had just been given by your father and , in some way , that must have affected your driving			0
' her ( mrs @entity12 ) family have been absolutely torn apart by what happened and no sentence i give can do anything to remedy that tragedy			2
