the small community of @entity1 in @entity2 was decimated by a monster landslide that engulfed 27 houses in thousands of tonnes of mud and soil in 1952			1
now , more than 60 years later , the remains of eight houses , presumed to be lost forever under layers of silt , have been discovered by engineers working on a crumbling river bank			1
the properties were rediscovered during the excavation of the banks of the @entity17 as part of a million - pound scheme to stabilise the area			0
now , over 60 years later , the remains of eight houses have been found , including a pretty tile floor dating from the 19th century ( pictured ) workers at the site said they were amazed when they uncovered artefacts including an ornate @entity30 - style mosaic floor from a cottage , an intact bread oven and even an old kettle in the ruined houses			1
in particular , the patterned floors and elaborately decorated @entity37 tiles are thought to date back to the @entity39 era and may have been made between 1890 and 1910			1
