@entity0 midfielder @entity1 is looking on the bright side after the champions squandered the chance to close the gap on @entity6			1
@entity0 blew a chance to move within a point of the @entity10 leaders on sunday as they surrendered a 2 - 0 lead to draw 2 - 2 with relegation battlers @entity12 at the @entity14			1
@entity1 was at a loss to explain @entity0 's capitulation but pointed out that no ground was lost on @entity6 - who drew at @entity19 - and immediately looked to the next opportunity			1
@entity1 strikes from range to put @entity0 two goals up at home to @entity12 the @entity24 , who saw his effort go in off the underside of the crossbar , said he was very happy with the strike @entity1 poses with fellow @entity24 midfielder @entity30 on monday at @entity0 training the @entity24 said : ' i do n't know exactly what went wrong			1
in the first half we played so well , and created so many chances to score , but in the second half we did n't do it			2
' it was a result we did n't expect but it happened			0
we need to keep heads up and think about the next game			0
it is not over , there are still a lot of games to play			0
' it is not a bad result - a bad result is losing			2
we have one point and we will try to win the next game to get the three points			1
' @entity6 drew , we drew and the @entity10 is still open			2
the race for the title is still open			0
' it is too early to decide the title now , and we need to keep playing and winning games , and we will see what will happen			0
' @entity0 had a club record 10th successive win in their sights as , again without a recognised striker on the pitch , they controlled the first half			1
@entity12 were not outplayed but there only seemed one result as @entity66 struck his fourth in three appearances and @entity1 doubled the lead with a stunning long - range strike			1
when @entity1 's strike went in @entity72 looked on course for a routine three points against struggling @entity12 @entity75 ' late strike earns a vital point for the visitors , stunning the @entity14 crowd ' i am so happy to score that goal , ' said @entity1 , of his powerful hit that cannoned in off the underside of the bar			1
' but unfortunately it was not enough to help us win the game			2
' @entity0 were rocked two minutes into the second half as the @entity12 hit back , although there was controversy over @entity91 's 47th - minute strike			1
the @entity92 was in offside position as he got the faintest of touches to help a @entity97 cross-cum - shot past @entity98			0
there was debate over whether @entity91 made contact at all but replays indicated that there was and that @entity0 were therefore unlucky			1
but the hosts still let their intensity slip and all the energy after the break came from @entity12			2
they arguably deserved the point that came their way as @entity75 lashed a fierce drive into the roof of the net nine minutes from time after @entity114 had lofted a free - kick into the box			2
@entity117 expresses his frustration to @entity119 , as @entity0 failed to hold on for three points midfielder @entity121 chases @entity1 as @entity12 showed energy and endeavour to fight back the result was not enough to lift them out of the bottom three but the performance offered further proof that they have the wherewithal to survive			1
despite a run of just one win in seven games , @entity12 have shown their battling qualities of late , not least in their narrow loss to @entity134 on @entity135			1
midfielder @entity121 said : ' from the start of the season we have been growing in belief and here that was evident and proof , if we needed it , that we can compete with anybody			0
' it is one of the toughest places , if not the toughest , place to come			0
there are a lot of positives and we 're very happy			0
' outside of our own camp there would n't have been much belief that we could get something , especially when we went 2 - 0 down			1
' but that is what the manager has built at this club - a relentless mentality to keep going and see where it leads us at the end of the 90 minutes			0
that was evident in the second half			0
' we felt we could have got more on @entity135			0
we definitely did n't deserve to lose the game , and we felt we should have won it really			0
' but to bounce back in this fashion is great for us and gives us that belief to go and do what we have got to do			0

@entity117 's team threw away a two - goal lead to draw with @entity12
a win would have taken @entity0 to within a point of @entity6
@entity1 had made it 2 - 0 with a stunning first - half strike
