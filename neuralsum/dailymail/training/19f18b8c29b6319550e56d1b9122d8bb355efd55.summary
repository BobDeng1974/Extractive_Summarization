the number of people in the @entity2 infected with @entity3 has reached an all - time high , new figures show			1
nearly 110,000 are living with the condition , but around a quarter are unaware they have it			1
they are therefore at risk of passing on the virus to others through unprotected sex , experts warn			1
the figures , from @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , have been released ahead of @entity15			1
nearly 110,000 people in the @entity2 are living with @entity3 , but around a quarter are unaware they have it , experts have warned ahead of @entity15 they show that overall , more people are being diagnosed earlier			1
the proportion of people diagnosed with a late stage of hiv infection fell from 57 per cent in 2004 to 42 per cent in 2013			1
meanwhile , around six per cent of gay and bisexual men are now living with @entity3			1
this rises to 13 per cent in @entity27 - meaning that one in eight sexually active gay men now has the condition			1
in 2013 , 3,250 men were newly diagnosed - an all - time annual high			2
it is estimated that over 7,000 gay men have an hiv infection that remains undiagnosed and that an estimated 2,800 men acquired @entity3 in 2013			1
doctors say these figures highlight the need to increase both the numbers and frequency of hiv tests , which is critical to tackling the ongoing high levels of @entity3 transmission			2
in a statement , @entity14 ( @entity44 ) said : ' while the large majority of black @entity48 do not have the @entity3 infection , the report also draws attention to the fact that one - third of the 40,000 black @entity54 heterosexual men and women living with @entity3 in the @entity2 do not know they have @entity3			1
' dr @entity56 , head of @entity14 's national @entity3 surveillance , said : ' we ca n’t overstate the importance of testing for @entity3 to ensure an early diagnosis			0
early diagnosis of @entity3 enables better treatment outcomes and reduces the risk of onward transmission			0
to get a test ... go to an open access @entity67 ( some clinics in large cities are offering ‘ fast - track ’ hiv testing ) or go to a community testing site			0
ask your gp for an hiv test – nowadays there is no need for lengthy discussion about the test , it just involves having blood taken , or even a finger prick			0
ask online for a self - sampling kit			0
' people diagnosed promptly with @entity3 infection can expect to live long and healthy lives			2
' however in 2013 , people diagnosed with @entity3 late were 10 times more likely to die in the first year of diagnosis compared to those diagnosed promptly			2
' people who remain unaware of their infection are also at risk of transmitting @entity3 to others			2
' knowing hiv status is the key to both effective treatment , and to preventing onward transmission '			0
as a result , @entity14 is encouraging people most at risk to take an hiv test			0
this includes gay , bisexual and other men who have sex with men and black @entity48 in particular			2
professor @entity108 , head of the @entity3 & @entity67 department , said : ' used correctly and consistently , condoms remain an inexpensive and effective way to prevent @entity3			0
' we are also now seeing important and exciting data on ways to use antiretroviral medication to prevent @entity3			0
' @entity14 has also issued advice on safer sexual behaviour to reduce the risk of @entity3			0
around six per cent of gay and bisexual men are now living with @entity3 ( the infection is pictured ) get tested regularly for @entity3 if you are one of those most - at - risk : * men who have sex with men are advised to have an @entity3 and @entity67 screen at least annually , and every three months if having unprotected sex with new or casual partners			1
* @entity54 men and women are advised to have an hiv test and a regular @entity3 and @entity67 screen if having unprotected sex with new or casual partners			1
* always use a condom correctly and consistently , and until all partners have had a sexual health screen			0
* reduce the number of sexual partners and avoid overlapping sexual relationships			0
* unprotected sex with partners believed to be of the same hiv status ( serosorting ) is unsafe			1
for the hiv positive , there is a high risk of acquiring other stis and hepatitis			0
for the @entity3 negative , there is a high risk of @entity3 transmission as well as of acquiring @entity148 and hepatitis .			0
