@entity7 , 24 , had drunk at least two glasses of red wine and taken anti-depressants before getting into her @entity11 in @entity12 in south east @entity13			2
@entity14 heard she smashed into a parked @entity16 van at around 4.50am but fled the scene and later told police her car had been taken without her knowledge			1
guilty : @entity1 @entity7 , 24 , lied about crashing her car after drinking wine and fleeing the scene prosecutor mr. @entity22 told the court : ' it was a fairly serious accident in the sense of damage to the vehicles			1
' the impact caused a wheel to collapse and there was also heavy damage to the @entity11 , which lost its front bumper and the airbag was deployed			2
' when @entity7 was tracked down by police , she claimed she had left it on her driveway after arguing with an unnamed male who had been in her house with a friend			1
' the defendant told the police she had left the vehicle locked on her driveway at 4pm and a friend and two unnamed males remained in her house , ' said prosecutor @entity22			1
' she said she had a confrontation with one of them and left the house and car keys on the kitchen table			2
' but her story unravelled after officers recovered her dna on the car 's airbag and text messages she sent to a friend telling her she had been in a crash			1
@entity7 , of @entity60 , @entity59 pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice after the incident on july 22 last year			1
her defence lawyer @entity64 , claimed she fled the house because she was receiving unwanted attention from one of the men			0
' it was a hand on the knee from a frisky male who had been drinking			0
she did not want to lose consciousness while with a man giving her unwanted attention , ' he said			0
' she knew she had some alcohol and damage that was sufficient to deploy an airbag is pretty significant			0
jailed : @entity7 was sentenced to eight weeks in prison at @entity14 today ' it is to her regret that she did not act differently and when the police became involved it was embedded and she could not face up to the situation			2
' sentencing her to eight weeks in prison recorder @entity85 said : ' for five years you were a @entity1 and stood as a person in a position of trust and responsibility ' ' you of all people should not have even thought of the commission of an offence of this kind			0
you accept you had two glasses of wine and your counsel says on top of that you had medication that caused you to panic			0
' ' from the outset you gave a wholly false account			0
this is a very serious criminal offence and except for exceptional circumstances an immediate custodial sentence must follow			0
