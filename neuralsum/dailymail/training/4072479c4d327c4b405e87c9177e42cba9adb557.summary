a popular photo - sharing website owned by @entity1 has told users it now owns the rights to their pictures			1
@entity5 will not give any warning or payment before cashing in on the images posted on its site			2
it means pictures by children as young as 13 could be sold to advertisers			0
people whose photos have been taken by @entity5 users risk finding their image published without their knowledge			2
' did we mention its free ? ' except @entity5 's new terms of service makes clear that users grant the company rights over all their photos and personal information uploaded to the site the new policy will operate from the middle of january under changes to terms and conditions announced yesterday			1
@entity5 ’s 30million global users can not opt out and must close their accounts to maintain control over their images			0
the change does not affect users of @entity1 , which bought @entity5 for £ 616million in april			1
the new terms make clear that users effectively hand over the rights to their pictures and personal information in exchange for ‘ free ’ access to @entity5			2
its website now reads : ‘ you agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username , likeness , photos ... in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions , without any compensation to you			0
’ @entity1 ceo @entity59 : his company bought out @entity5 in a $ 715million deal in september the site also updated its privacy settings to share information about its users with @entity1 as well as with other affiliates and advertisers			1
@entity5 says users must be at least 13 years old to sign up for the service			2
but the new rules assume that when an underage teenager signs up , a parent or guardian is aware that their child ’s image , username and photos might be used in adverts			2
the shake - up was described as a ‘ disgusting ’ and ‘ egregious ’ breach of privacy yesterday			0
@entity84 , of campaign group @entity83 , said : ‘ people thought they were @entity5 ’s customers , but in reality users are @entity5 ’s product			0
it goes to show when respecting people ’s data and privacy come into conflict with profit , there ’s only ever going to be one winner			0
’ @entity5 said the changes will make it easier to integrate with @entity1			1
if @entity5 's new terms of service are tough for your to swallow , there is a quick way to remove yourself from the service - and save all your pictures			1
first you need to download all the pictures you have handed over to the app. @entity105 recommends using @entity106 , which will download your entire library in just a few minutes			0
once your photos have been rescued , you can upload them to another photo - sharing service with less invasive terms like @entity112			1
once your photos have been removed , its time to delete your account - but bear in mind that once it 's gone , it 's gone forever			0
@entity5 will not reactivate delected accounts and you will never again be able to sign up to the service with the same user name			1
‘ this means we can do things like fight spam more effectively , detect system and reliability problems more quickly , and build better features for everyone by understanding how @entity5 is used , ’ it said			0
it came as @entity130 , @entity1 ’s @entity131 policy director , told a @entity133 committee that ministers should n’t introduce tough laws surrounding the use of data			1
‘ our services are free to users but they do n’t cost us nothing			0
we have to pay for it and the way we pay for that is advertising and that involves innovative use of the data people provide to us , ’ he said yesterday			0
@entity5 launched in 2010 and allows users to share on @entity150 and @entity1 images they have taken with digital devices including iphones			1
the app configures photos to produce a square shape similar to the @entity157 images of the 1970s			0
there are 11 filters that can produce a ‘ retro ’ look			0
@entity5 no longer allows @entity150 users to view its photographs in tweets in an effort to drive more people away from the rival social media company to its own website			1
@entity170 , ceo of the photo - sharing service , which was snapped up by @entity1 earlier this year , said @entity5 has turned off support for ' @entity150 cards , ' signalling a deepening rift between two of the web 's biggest brands			1
@entity150 users started to complain earlier this month in public messages that @entity5 photos were not displaying properly on @entity150 's website			1
clarifying the situation , mr @entity170 released a statement saying : ' we believe the best experience is for us to link back to where the content lives			0
' @entity5 started off as a smartphone application - only service but has recently improved its website			2
' a handful of months ago , we supported @entity150 cards because we had a minimal web presence , ' mr @entity170 said , noting that the company has since released new features that allow users to comment about and ' like ' photos directly on @entity5 's website			1
the rivalry between @entity1 and @entity150 intensified in april when the former outbid @entity150 to nab fast - growing @entity5 in a cash - and - stock deal valued at the time at $ 1billion			1
@entity1 is developing its own in - house equivalent to @entity201 , the controversial photo messaging app that has been accused of promoting ' sexting ' among youngsters			2
@entity201 allows users to send pictures with a time limit - meaning that they automatically delete themselves after a predetermined time has elapsed			0
the messaging service has reportedly become popular for sending flirtatious pictures , with recipients unable to hang on to the embarrassing evidence and leak it online			0
however , it has come under fire for promising more privacy than it can guarantee , since it remains possible to take a screengrab of the picture before it self destructs			0
@entity1 , the world 's most popular social network , reportedly plans to launch its own @entity201 - like service in the coming weeks , before the end of the year			1
the new app will be standalone and separate from the main @entity1 app , bringing the social network 's app count up to five .			2

@entity5 's new terms of service and privacy policy bring it into line with those of parent company @entity1
comes after standoff between @entity5 and @entity150 over photo apps
company claims the right to use any uploaded photos or user data to promote its *partners* ' products
it adds that it may not always identify when these recommendations are merely adverts or genuine user actions
