a mother who was so fat that struggled to climb the stairs to her flat , lost ten stone after realising she would have to diet or move house			1
weighing 19st 6lbs and wearing size 24 clothes , @entity9 , 30 , from @entity10 was left breathless and sweating every time she tackled the three flights of stairs to her two - bedroom maisonette			1
with three young children and a pushchair , it felt like climbing a mountain several times a day to morbidly obese @entity19			2
she decided it was crunch time - move house or diet and then lost ten stone in under a year ( right ) @entity19 was faced with either moving or losing the weight			1
but after losing lost ten stone and going from a size 24 to a size eight she can handle the stairs with ease			1
in fact , instead of dreading them , they have now become part of her new healthy workout regime			2
@entity19 who is 5ft 8ins tall said : ‘ at my size , the stairs were the blight of my life			1
sometimes i would n’t even bother going out because i was so heavy that i was already tired out just getting to the bottom , never mind climbing back up			2
‘ i hated them and started looking at other properties to move into just because i was too fat to cope with them			1
' @entity19 at the top of the stairs to her flat - now she has lost ten stone , she incorporates them into her exercise regime she continued : ‘ it was hard enough when i had two children , but when my youngest son was born and i had to try and carry a baby and a buggy as well as all my fat , i knew i could not continue			1
' it was diet or move			1
‘ now i run up and down them in seconds , it ’s great			2
’ @entity19 admits that she used pregnancy as an excuse to eat whatever she wanted without feeling guilty @entity19 admits the stairs were already a battle for her and her two older sons @entity76 , 11 and @entity77 , six , but it was falling pregnant with @entity78 , now one , that was the tipping point			1
she said : ‘ i ’ve always been a bigger girl , even at school i was a size 16 , but with each pregnancy i ’ve gained more and more weight and with @entity78 , i put on more than five stone			1
’ @entity19 admits that she used the pregnancy as an excuse to eat whatever she wanted without feeling guilty			2
she said : ‘ i think a lot of women will identify with that feeling			2
it ’s the one time you do n’t have to feel bad about it			1
' so on top of carb - heavy meals she regularly snacked on extra toast , sandwiches and crisps			1
she said : ‘ @entity100 food has always been my downfall			0
i could take or leave sweets and chocolate but not crisps and sandwiches			0
’ but it still came as a surprise to learn that after @entity108 was born in december 2013 , she weighed 19 stone 6lbs			1
@entity19 said : ‘ i was mortified			0
it was the heaviest i had ever been in my life and i felt awful for allowing myself to get so fat			0
' i used to tell myself that because i was tall i could carry the weight but i was clearly very unhealthy not to be able to climb the stairs without sweating and panting			1
’ she also suffered back pains and anxiety , both caused by her weight			0
but it was trying to navigate the dreaded stairs with her newborn and pushchair that was the final straw			1
she said : ‘ to me it was like climbing @entity124 even before i ’d started the school run			0
‘ i ’d get to the bottom a sweaty out of breath mess , i felt embarrassed and ashamed that it had come to that			0
’ as well as struggling to reach her own home , @entity19 claims her weight also impacted on the way she parented her sons			0
@entity19 with her youngest child @entity136 , who was born in december 2013 , she weighed 19st 6lbs she said : ' my older sons would want me to play dance games with them on their @entity140 but i could n’t even finish one song			1
‘ if they wanted to go to the park , my heart sank because i just was n’t fit enough to keep up with them			0
’ so 12 weeks after giving birth in march 2014 , she signed up to the @entity146			0
she swapped all food for meal replacement products from a range of shakes , cars and soups			0
she said : ‘ the @entity153 just took all food out of the equation for me , which is what i needed			0
‘ i thought i would be starving considering the amount i had been eating , but i actually felt better and less sluggish			0
' @entity19 went from a size 24 to a size 8 in under a year in the first week she lost ten pounds and then continued to lose around three or four pounds a month until she reached her target of 10 stone 10 pounds in just seven months and a dress size 12			1
she used the dreaded stairs as part of her exercise routine and found they became easier to tackle as the weeks passed			2
but miss @entity9 was so thrilled with the results of her diet physically and emotionally that she continued on the plan until she reached a size eight weighing 9 stone 10 pounds in december last year			1
she said : ‘ i can not tell you how much easier my life became after losing the weight			0
not just because i could handle the stairs so well , but also what i could do with my sons			2
‘ when my eldest told me he was proud of me i was over the moon because they are the reason i did it			0
‘ however my middle son is a little annoyed that i am not as comfortable to snuggle up to now all my padding has gone			0
’ @entity19 after her weight loss with her youngest son @entity136 @entity19 's only regret is not losing the weight earlier			0
she said : ‘ i have never been a size eight in my life and it feels amazing			0
i ’m just gutted i missed out for so long and there is no way i will ever let myself go like that again			0
‘ i do n’t just look better , i feel a million times better			0
’ a move is still on the cards , but only because she would prefer her son ’s to live in a home with a garden			2
‘ i ’m looking for a house that suits as better , but now it ’s because that ’s what our family needs , not because i ’m too fat to climb the stairs			1

@entity9 was breathless each time she took the stairs to her flat
20 - year - old from @entity10 weighed 19st 6lbs after having a third child
she decided it was time to move house or diet and lost ten stone in a year
