@entity0 , 77 , has fought breast cancer for 30 years and endured dozens of operations , treatments and drugs a 77 - year - old woman has spoken of her 30 year battle with breast cancer , in which she discovered a tumour almost every six years			1
@entity0 discovered her first tumour in 1984 and has since undergone a double mastectomy and countless rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
she has even had cancer in the scar tissue left by her mastectomy			0
over the past three decades , she has lived through innovations in treatment for the disease and helped pioneer experimental drugs which have since become commonplace			2
she has also raised more than £ 1 million for specialist treatment centres for breast cancer			1
despite various different treatments , including three different drugs , her cancer has repeatedly returned over the decades			2
mrs @entity0 , an accountant who lives in @entity27 , is now in remission from her latest bout of the disease last year - and remains stoic and positive about the future			1
she said treatment of breast cancer has changed dramatically since the 1980s			1
' when i was first diagnosed no one spoke about it			0
we would be kept on a general ward , ' she said			0
' there was no such thing as after care , it was more like ' we have done our job , that 's it			0
' no one was specially trained and although you could tell they wanted to do more for you , they had no training , so they were almost scared they would do something wrong			0
' i remember going for check - ups in an old hospital and it had cubicles set up in a ward with just curtains around each area			0
you could hear everything that was being said			0
' that was really hard , you did n't want to hear other people and you did n't want to make much of a fuss because you did n't want everybody else hearing about you			0
' mrs @entity0 was first diagnosed with cancer after she went to the doctors complaining of a pulled muscle around her breast			1
although medics suspected cancer it took weeks to formally identify the disease as the hospital had limited resources , including an old , inefficient scanner			0
after six weeks she was finally given the diagnosis and was admitted to hospital for a lumpectomy to remove the tumour , followed by radiotherapy			2
in 1991 , mrs @entity0 set up the charity bust , which has raised more than £ 1 million for specialist breast cancer treatment centres			1
at that time , breast cancer was treated on general wards by general surgeons			1
mrs @entity0 is pictured here at a bust fundraising ball mrs @entity0 is pictured with husband @entity85 , 78 , at the @entity86 in march 2009			2
despite finding a tumour almost every six years , she remains positive for the future @entity89 is an anti-oestrogen drug that is widely used to treat breast cancer			1
it ‘ s occasionally used to treat some other cancers			0
it binds to oestrogen receptors , cutting off the hormone so it can no longer feed the growth of cancer cells			0
a large new sutdy published last year found that women with breast cancer that keeps coming back may be able to beat the disease by taking @entity89 for ten years after surgery			1
using tamoxifen for ten rather than five years halves the risk of women dying from the most common kind of breast cancer			1
the study was described as a ' pivotal moment ' in the fight against the disease			0
just four years later doctors discovered another lump and mrs @entity0 was told a single mastectomy was her only choice			1
' having breast cancer as a specific entity was still just part of general surgery , you were n't treated specifically because you had it , ' she added			1
in 1990 , she was once more diagnosed with cancer when it developed in her scar tissue			0
after her doctor ' cut it out and dragged the skin back together ' , she was put on the then revolutionary drug @entity89			0
this is used to treat breast cancer and occasionally other cancers			1
it binds to oestrogen receptors , cutting off the hormone so it can no longer feed the growth of cancer cells			0
despite being prescribed @entity89 , just a year later mrs @entity0 was back in hospital again when doctors found the disease in her scar for the second time and she underwent surgery to reform her breast			1
as she was recovering on the ward she met fellow sufferers @entity146 and @entity147 and they launched bust , a charity to ensure specialist treatment could be given			2
all three had been shocked by the lack of support for breast cancer patients treated on general wards			1
mrs @entity0 remembers that on general wards , there was only a curtain around a woman 's bed so everyone could hear their breast cancer diagnosis			1
she set up bust so that specialist treatment centres with separate diagnosis rooms could be opened			2
here , she is pictured ( far right ) at the opening of a centre in @entity27 mrs @entity0 is pictured with husband @entity85 in @entity166 in 2003			0
in 2000 her cancer returned and she had another mastectomy , chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
through her fundraising ( right ) she has managed to raise £ 1 million			1
here she is pictured receiving a cheque from @entity174 group they set about trying to help specialist surgeon @entity176 , who had taken an interest in breast cancer			1
mrs @entity0 said : ' we saw how much needed to be done and how good a surgeon @entity180 was			0
he seemed much more interested in breast cancer than anybody else			1
' people thought you were just on a conveyor belt and the next patient would be along with a hernia or something else			0
' he was much more committed to breast cancer , and we thought surely we could do something to make his job easier			2
' ' we built one of the first breast cancer care centre with a dedicated area and dedicated support nurses so you had a place to go when you did n't get the best news			2
' we built the new unit with nice consulting rooms , to treat people in a much more caring way			0
' sadly , her cancer returned yet again in 2000 where she had another mastectomy , chemotherapy and radiotherapy			2
after being told she was in remission she developed more lumps six years later , and again in 2012			0
she had surgery once again in september 2012 to remove her lymph nodes completely , and went back on drug @entity89			1
she underwent another bout of radiotherapy after doctors spotted a ' cancer hotspot ' and it is hoped she is now , once more , in remission			2
mrs @entity0 said : ' i do n't want people in their 40s developing cancer , thinking " oh my gosh it 's not going to go away " , my case is unusual			2
' if when i first had it and they had tamoxifen or another drug there is every chance it would never have come back			0
' my cancer is low grade so it would be easy to stop it , if the advances had been around at that time			0
' pictured is a newspaper clipping of a story about @entity240 when it was set up in 1991			0
mrs @entity0 remembers being left on general wards and being treated by those who did n't understand the disease , as well as given unnecessary surgery and inefficient scans			2
