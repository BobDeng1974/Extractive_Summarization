despite claims @entity3 ’s @entity2 phones barely have enough storage for all the pre-installed software and apps , let alone a user ’s files , the company continues to sell it as an entry - level model			1
but , rather than being a short - sighted move , one analyst believes it is a calculated strategy designed to get people to buy larger devices as soon as possible			2
in fact , @entity17 claims @entity3 makes an extra $ 3 billion ( £ 1.9 billion ) each year by not doubling the amount of minimum storage every time a new model is released			1
@entity22 - based analyst @entity17 has studied @entity3 ’s @entity24 storage strategy and believes that by limiting storage on entry - level phones , customers are more likely to upgrade to a larger , more expensive , device the following year			1
this ultimately makes the firm an extra $ 3billion ( £ 1.9 billion ) each year ‘ @entity3 's decision to keep the entry - level storage tier at @entity2 for the @entity24 , despite doubling the other capacities to @entity37 and @entity38 , continues to raise eyebrows , ’ explained analyst @entity17 on his @entity33 site			1
‘ @entity3 's near - term motive behind keeping the @entity2 capacity option is pretty clear : get people to buy the @entity37 option			0
’ but , as mr @entity17 explained , @entity3 ’s strategy is more complex , and forward - thinking than that			2
he believes that by limiting the amount of storage on entry - level phones , in what he calls the ‘ lower tier ’ , customers will eventually upgrade to a larger device , in the middle tier , the following year			1
these customers are then more likely to then stay in the middle tier , or in some cases move to the upper tier , but are unlikely to downgrade to less storage			2
@entity3 offers the @entity59 ( left ) and @entity24 6 ( right ) in @entity2 , @entity37 and @entity38 models by limiting the amount of storage on entry - level phones , in the ‘ lower tier ’ , customers will eventually upgrade to a larger device , in the middle tier , the following year			1
these customers are more likely to then stay in the middle tier , or in some cases move to the upper tier , but are unlikely to downgrade to less storage			2
this trend is even more common if @entity3 keeps the entry - level the same , but boosts the storage by three times or more in the following year			2
however , if @entity3 doubles the amount of storage on the entry - level model each year , people upgrade but stay in the lower tier			1
all of these figures are taken from @entity17 's @entity33 site			0
in year one , @entity3 offers a @entity2 , @entity80 and @entity37 model and the customer buys the @entity2 version			0
the following year , @entity3 offers @entity2 , @entity37 and @entity38 models			0
the current @entity24 6 and 6 @entity84 are available in these sizes , for example			0
this prompts the user to either stay the same , or upgrade to @entity37 in year two			0
this @entity37 costs more than the @entity90 version did the previous year			0
by the third year , @entity3 can offer @entity80 as an entry - level model , but the customer wo n’t downgrade storage and stays with the @entity37 as a minimum			2
in year one , @entity3 offers a @entity2 , @entity80 and @entity37 model and the customer buys the @entity98 following year , @entity3 offers @entity2 , @entity37 and @entity38 models			0

this @entity37 costs more than the @entity90 version did the previous year example 2 alternatively , if @entity3 offers an entry - level @entity102 one year , but then increases this lower tier storage the year after to @entity80 , the customer may upgrade to a phone with larger storage , but they ’re still technically buying the entry - level model			1
and so on into year three , if @entity3 offers @entity37 as a minimum			0
this means they spend less money each year , and @entity3 ca n't move customers from the lower to the middle or higher tiers			0
alternatively , if @entity3 offers an entry - level @entity102 one year , but then increases this lower tier storage the year after to @entity80 , the customer may upgrade to a phone with larger storage , but they ’re still technically buying the entry - level model this trend is even more common if @entity3 keeps the entry - level the same , but boosts the storage by three times or more in the middle tier , the following year			1
however , if @entity3 doubles the amount of storage on the entry - level model each year , people upgrade but will always stay in the lower tier			1
for example , in year one , @entity3 offers a @entity2 , @entity80 and @entity37 model and the customer buys the @entity2 version			0
however , if @entity3 doubles the amount of storage on the entry - level model each year , people upgrade but stay in the lower tier			1
according to mr @entity17 's calculations , @entity3 's middle tier strategy makes @entity3 $ 47 billion ( £ 30 billion ) a year			1
but the lower tier strategy makes $ 44 billion ( £ 28 billion ) in january , which ? magazine tested the eight most popular @entity2 handsets from @entity140 , @entity3 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 , pictured			1
@entity140 's @entity145 was the worst performing handset , with only 54 % ( @entity146 ) of available storage , while @entity3 's @entity148 was the best , with 79 % ( @entity149 ) the following year , @entity3 offers @entity2 , @entity37 and @entity38 models			0
this prompts the user to either stay the same , or upgrade to @entity37 in year two at a higher premium than the @entity80 cost the previous year			0
by the third year , @entity3 can offer @entity80 as an entry - level model , but the customer wo n’t downgrade storage and stays with the @entity37 as a minimum			2
alternatively , if @entity3 offers an entry - level @entity102 one year , but then increases this lower tier storage the year after to @entity80 , the customer may upgrade to a phone with larger storage , but they ’re still technically buying the entry - level model			1
according to mr @entity17 's calculations , the middle tier strategy makes @entity3 $ 47 billion ( £ 30 billion ) a year			1
but the lower tier strategy makes $ 44 billion ( £ 28 billion )			2
this is a difference of $ 3 billion ( £ 1.9 billion )			1
mr @entity17 claims that this difference is based on @entity3 charging an average $ 20 ( £ 13 ) more for the handsets year - on - year			1
if @entity3 charged more , the difference would be greater			0
and so on into year three , if @entity3 offers @entity37 as a minimum			0
mr @entity17 also worked out how much revenue @entity3 makes by keeping the @entity2 model as a minimum , and using the middle tier strategy			1
according to his calculations , the middle tier strategy makes @entity3 $ 47 billion ( £ 30 billion ) a year			1
but the lower tier strategy makes $ 44 billion ( £ 28 billion ) - a difference of $ 3 billion ( £ 1.9 billion ) , simply by charging an average $ 20 ( £ 13 ) for the handsets			1
‘ by doubling the middle tier storage capacity to @entity37 , while maintaining the price , and keeping the @entity2 storage capacity at the bottom tier , i estimate that approximately 30 per cent of previous @entity184 owners will upgrade to @entity37 to take advantage of the better deal , ’ continued mr @entity17			2
‘ while some may say this discussion profitability is anti-consumer , observers need to look at this process as a bit more than just greed			0
‘ a case can be made that @entity3 is looking to get users dependent on higher storage , by carefully guiding customers into a particular @entity24 model each year			2

the @entity102 has a similar amount of storage as the @entity203 , at @entity204 , which has been dubbed ' inadequate ' by users .			0

analyst @entity17 has studied @entity3 ’s @entity24 storage strategy
he believes that by limiting storage on entry - level phones , customers are more likely to upgrade to a larger device the following year
these customers are then more likely to stay in this middle tier
this continues if @entity3 keeps the entry - level the same , but boosts the storage on middle - tier models in *subsequent* years
but , if @entity3 doubles storage on entry - level models each year , people upgrade but stay in the lower tier , and *pay* less
mr @entity17 claims this strategy makes @entity3 $ 3 billion ( £ 1.9 billion ) a year
