' better together ' : @entity3 rivals @entity4 , left , and @entity5 , right , have finally agreed to ' put their differences aside ' as they join forces in the battle against @entity11 independence campaign chiefs are now hopeful of persuading the pair to appear in public together under the ‘ better together ’ banner			1
in his 2011 memoirs , mr @entity5 – who is the chairman of @entity30 – accused mr @entity4 of ‘ hopeless ’ leadership and ‘ appalling behaviour ’ during his time in @entity34			1
mr @entity5 , mp for @entity36 , claimed that his boss was so misguided as prime minister that he believed the crippling economic downturn would be over in six months			1
the once close relationship between the pair finally ended when mr @entity5 gave an interview in 2008 describing the financial outlook as the worst for 60 years			0
mr @entity4 has shied away from public appearances following his defeat in the 2010 general election , and his main intervention in the referendum debate to date was to launch a separate @entity50 campaign , @entity51 with @entity3			2
the organisation was created to appease @entity3 voters and union leaders who oppose sharing a platform with the @entity56 under the cross-party ‘ better together ’ banner			2
but mr @entity5 was singled out for praise by mr @entity4 yesterday during the launch of the party ’s campaign for this month ’s @entity64 by - election , in which the former prime minister warned that independence would lead to a ‘ dog - eats - dog ’ fight across the @entity68			1
@entity11 's future : @entity11 first minister @entity70 presents his @entity71 for @entity11 independence at the @entity73 , @entity74 ' i ’m working very closely with @entity30 , ' mr @entity4 said			1
' i met people from @entity30 only a few days ago , and i think @entity5 is doing a great job			0
i think it ’s very important that in addition to the @entity3 campaign which @entity82 has launched for @entity3 ’s view of the future of @entity11 , we have this all - party group leading up to the referendum			2
all of us will be working closely with @entity30 in the next few months			0
' the @entity12 understands the pair met in @entity88 at the end of last year , and have since held face - to - face talks			0
one source said they agreed to ‘ put their differences aside ’ for the sake of the @entity96 ’ and another insider said the frosty relationship has ‘ thawed ’			0
as he returns from political exile , mr @entity4 will speak at a public event in @entity101 , @entity102 , this saturday to outline the case against independence			2
yesterday , he appeared at the launch of the @entity64 by - election campaign in the @entity107 in @entity101			0
mr @entity4 ’s @entity109 and @entity88 seat covers the @entity111 constituency , where the death of long - standing msp @entity113 has triggered a by - election			2
the event was also attended by candidate @entity117 , @entity102 leader and mr @entity4 ’s election agent , @entity11 @entity3 leader @entity120 and @entity102 provost @entity121 , the former @entity122 football manager			1
in an attack on @entity70 ’s vision of @entity11 independence , mr @entity4 said : ' what the @entity126 are forgetting is that in the last 100 years , we created in @entity11 and across the @entity135 a pooling and sharing of resources , where everyone – irrespective of their nationality – has an equal right to healthcare , an equal right to unemployment benefit , an equal right to pensions , and all the benefits of the welfare state			1
' if we decide that we want to give that up then people will have to be told by the @entity126 what the consequences are for pensioners , for young people , for people who are unemployed , for people who are sick and disabled			0
' he said different minimum wage and corporation tax levels would lead to a ‘ race to the bottom , a dog - eats - dog competition , divide - and - rule			0
and then all the benefits built up over a long period of time will be put at risk			0
' @entity126 msp @entity158 described mr @entity4 's comments as ' hypocritical nonsense '			2
' his remarks entirely ignore the fact that the @entity135 has become a much more unequal society under successive @entity88 governments , @entity56 and @entity3 , ' she said			0
' what @entity4 is saying is that vital social provisions such as welfare and the minimum wage are better decided by @entity56 at @entity88 rather than in @entity11 's own parliament , a position very out of touch with opinion in the @entity64 constituency			1
