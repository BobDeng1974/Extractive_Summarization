with the @entity3 champions coming to town and giving @entity5 a lesson in a 3 - 0 defeat , fans at @entity1 will have found it hard to take any positives home with them			1
here 's five things we 've learnt about @entity5 from their @entity12 struggles : it might be time to give @entity15 a go ... many thought a mouth - watering tie against the @entity12 holders might be the sort of occasion that would get @entity23 performing to his potential			1
instead , the enigmatic @entity25 attempted just 17 passes and had zero shots on target before being hooked at half - time after swapping shirts with @entity31			0
it was always going to be a tough evening for the 24 - year - old as a lone striker , but he wasted any promising moves started by his team - mates and his hold - up play was non-existent			0
maybe it ’s time to give @entity15 a run in the side			2
he would at least look interested if nothing else			0
@entity23 warms up alongside @entity15 - @entity43 is still missing through injury @entity23 underwhelmed in the first half and was hauled off by @entity46 at half time @entity5 's centre back pairing just is n't working the @entity1 club ’s first - choice centre backs @entity51 and @entity52 are undeniably strong in the air , but the pair look too similar to form an effective partnership on the deck			1
both are aggressive and their tendency to dive into tackles leaves huge holes in and behind @entity5 ’s back line			2
in the @entity63 @entity5 play a high defensive line , which often allows opposition attackers a clear run on goal when the centre backs have committed themselves			0
they tried to compensate for this against @entity72 ’s myriad of attacking talent by playing deeper , but neither @entity52 nor @entity51 looked comfortable in a more passive , covering role and @entity75 and @entity76 ran rings around them			1
@entity51 and @entity52 are very similar in style and have n't gelled well at the back for @entity5 three points from three games leave hopes hanging by a thread the atmosphere at @entity1 before kick - off may have been as electric as ever , but at the moment it ’s the only thing that remains from @entity5 ’s @entity3 glory days – besides @entity89 , of course			1
granted , they were playing the @entity12 holders on wednesday night but the @entity93 had never so much as scored against the @entity95 club before , let alone beaten them			0
this time it was emphatic - @entity5 's first ever home @entity3 defeat by three goals			0
then there was the 1 - 0 defeat at @entity101 earlier in the month , as well as the laboured victory over @entity103 in september			0
they ’re halfway through the group stage and @entity5 ’s @entity12 status is already hanging by a thread – probably not the return to the big stage @entity89 had in mind			1
@entity89 has been around for some of @entity5 's greatest @entity3 nights - this was n't one the @entity114 were in fine voice to begin with but were silenced by @entity72 's first - half show of strength the opening 22 minutes looked strong , but they tired @entity5 were long odds to beat @entity72 before the match , and understandably so , but their performance in the first 22 minutes may have had the bookies squirming in their seats			1
the @entity124 made an excellent start and surged into @entity72 ’s penalty box on numerous occasions , but @entity75 ’s opener knocked them for six and they looked too exhausted to claw their way back into the game			2
clearly , sunday ’s hard - fought win over @entity132 took a lot out of them – eight of the starting @entity136 at @entity137 began the match with @entity140 ’s side			0
@entity5 set about re-investing the money from @entity143 ’s transfer in numerous players after it was adjudged that the size of their squad would not allow them to compete effectively in four competitions this season			0
however , the foreign signings are struggling to adapt to the pace and physicality of the @entity154 game , and it ’s now clear how invaluable a player with the work - rate and engine of @entity143 really is			0
@entity159 was a key part of a strong start from @entity5 but they suffered later on @entity162 was among eight players to start here and at @entity132 in a 3 - 2 win on sunday a return to @entity168 's top table might have come too soon has the @entity12 come too soon for @entity5 ? it ’s what the club and the fans were desperate for during their three - year absence from the competition , but their demolition by @entity72 showed just how far off the pace they are			1
in order to bridge the gap between them and the current @entity3 big guns , they will need to re-establish themselves as a @entity12 club and put together a long run in the competition , giving them the opportunity to build the level of squad required			2
however , with a decent run in this year ’s tournament looking unlikely and their @entity63 form shaky , @entity5 ’s return to the @entity12 might be their last appearance in the competition for some time			1
@entity5 have won five @entity196 but perhaps their return to this competition came too soon ? @entity75 was the star of the show and his world - class ability made it tough for @entity5			2

@entity15 could be an option to *replace* *disappointing* @entity23
@entity51 and @entity52 seem too similar at the back as a pair
their @entity12 hopes are hanging by a thread now
@entity5 looked strong early on , but they tired after big game on sunday
they showed a return to the @entity12 may have come too soon
