@entity0 has tried to diffuse a brewing club vs country battle between @entity3 and @entity4 by insisting he was not referring to @entity5 and @entity6 when he questioned certain players ' commitment to @entity4			1
speaking to @entity9 on wednesday , @entity0 said : ' it depends on the player 's make - up but i would have cleared up the matter so there were no repercussions and no room for any doubts			2
‘ often with injuries there can be a world of difference between what we have and what is said in public			0
@entity0 , in action training for @entity4 , has moved to clarify comments he made earlier this week @entity6 played against @entity29 last week , but has withdrawn from the latest @entity4 squad @entity3 striker @entity5 celebrates his goal against @entity29 to keep the @entity32 at the summit of the table ‘ it ’s difficult because this is not a club team but the national team where you do not come every day			1
laying out rules is difficult			0
but above all i would have liked the players to show the same commitment to the national team as they do to their club			1
‘ you must show this commitment and spirit to all the new players			2
there are times i have played despite having some niggles			0
it all depends on the dna of the player			0
‘ i wish players had same the level of commitment with the national team as with their clubs			1
' @entity0 ' comments were interpreted as a direct response to @entity5 pulling out of the @entity4 squad before playing , and scoring , against @entity29 , and @entity6 returning to @entity61 after arriving in @entity62 with a hamstring complaint			1
@entity64 pictured at the @entity65 for @entity67 's defeat against @entity68 on thursday night but @entity0 has done his best to calm the waters saying : ' when i spoke about commitment i did not want to say that those two did not have it			2
the row between @entity3 and @entity4 has been simmering all season with @entity75 ignoring @entity64 's desire for @entity5 not to play two games in a week during the last international break			1
the striker returned with a hamstring injury and missed the next two games with his club			0
adding fuel to the flames is the shared history of @entity64 , @entity0 and @entity4 captain @entity86			2
@entity64 fell out with the goalkeeper when he was his manager at @entity62 because @entity86 felt that @entity64 's cranking up of tension between @entity90 and @entity62 was affecting the national side			0
much to @entity64 's disgust he even called @entity90 's @entity93 to make peace between the two camps .			0

@entity0 moved to clarify comments he made about the @entity3 pair
earlier this week he told @entity100 : ' i want players to show same commitment to national team as they do to their club '
but *defender* now insists he was *n't* speaking about @entity5 or @entity6
the @entity32 *duo* pulled out of @entity4 squad for *upcoming* *friendlies* against @entity112 and @entity113
