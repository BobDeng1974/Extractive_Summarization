but before he died , in 2011 , he and his second wife @entity22 , 59 , fought a bitter battle through the divorce courts for four years over his fortune , before she was awarded just £ 750,000			1
a judge found that mr @entity15 had squandered millions of his winnings through ' wasteful expenditure ' and ' bad decision making			1
' but now his beautician ex-wife has now appeared back in court , seeking to boost her slice to more than £ 1million by claiming his death has freed up more of his cash by allowing him to avoid a huge tax bill			1

his lawyers argued that the farm into which he had sunk his gambling fortune was all held in trust for @entity64 , his daughter from his first marriage , and his two children from his marriage to mrs @entity0			0
however , divorce judge , mrs justice baron , ordered the trust controlling the farm to pay out a £ 756,000 lump sum to mrs @entity0			0
in her ruling , the judge said the divorce had ' a tragically long history ' and had run up ' mammoth ' legal costs			1

mr @entity15 made a fortune by landing a series of six - figure bets on his own horses			1
when he died , aged 73 , he owned a seven - bedroom country estate in @entity21 which had been valued at £ 4.25million ' i found the husband to be a charming rogue			0
i liked him ' , the judge said , but added : ' despite that i consider that he is a shrewd and manipulative individual who told me many untruths			0
' his habitual modus operandi is to ignore authority and do things his way and on his terms '			0
she also dubbed mr @entity15 ' a master of the betting coup ' , saying that , in december 1978 , a gamble at @entity102 was alleged to have netted him the equivalent of £ 1m in today 's money			2
' there were other six - figure betting coups and he became notorious as a successful punter ' , she said			1
the judge said @entity64 , also a racehorse trainer , was ' a devoted daughter who was very supportive of her father ' , who had been generous to her , assisting her with money and advice			0
mrs @entity0 she described as ' bright and amusing ' and ' a resourceful woman '			0

she told the judges that a deal had been done with @entity145 by one of the companies controlling the dead man 's fortune , which had reduced a £ 2m - plus tax demand to just £ 850,000			1
