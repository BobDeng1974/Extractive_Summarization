@entity29 , left , and her husband accompanied her 89 - year - old mother @entity31 , who suffered from spinal stenosis , to @entity33 in 2010 where assisted suicide is legal , to end her life - she was overjoyed at the @entity2 @entity9 's decision to lift the ban on doctor - assisted suicide on friday @entity38 , an @entity39 ( @entity39 ) patient and activist , who joined the right to die lawsuit in 2011 , passed away from her illness in 2012			1
the family of a second woman suffering from a degenerative spinal cord condition , @entity31 , 89 , who was forced to travel to @entity33 to end her life , were also plaintiffs			2
' justice , dignity and compassion were the defining qualities of my mother , ' @entity29 said after friday 's decision came down			1
' we just felt that it was a fundamental right for @entity2 that they should have this choice			2
' she called it ' a huge victory for @entity2 and a legacy for @entity31			0
' assisted suicide is legal in @entity33 , along with a number of other @entity8 countries and a few @entity7 states including @entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity68			0
@entity2 's @entity9 last considered assisted suicide in 1993 with the case of 42 - year - old @entity71 , who also suffered from @entity39			1
however , a lift on the ban was dismissed with a ruling at the time citing prohibitions on assisted suicide as ' the norm among @entity78 democracies			0

commenting on friday 's turnaround , @entity85 , litigation director of @entity86 , which initiated the challenge , said : ' this is one incredible day			1
the @entity9 in @entity10 ( pictured above ) said the practice would be allowed in the case of consenting adults who are suffering intolerably from a severe medical condition ' physician - assisted dying is now recognized for what it is : a medical service that brings an end , for some individuals , tounbearable suffering			1
' @entity101 can overturn the decision before the year is up but that is an unlikely outcome			0
since 1993 pressure for assisted suicide has persisted			0

however , the @entity127 argued this week the ban on doctor - assisted suicide infringes the ' life , liberty and security ' of a person			0
