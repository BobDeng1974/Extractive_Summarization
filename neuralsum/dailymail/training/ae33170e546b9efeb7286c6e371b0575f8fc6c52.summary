by @entity0 published : 11:24 est , 26 november 2013 @entity2 : 11:29 est , 26 november 2013 rain as acidic as lemon juice may have played a part in killing off plants and organisms around the world during the most severe mass extinction in @entity10 's history			1
a team of @entity13 scientists have simulated the @entity14 , which occurred around 252 million years ago , when the vast majority of species became extinct			1
while the massive extinction is a matter of scientific debate , the researchers found that sulphur emissions from massive volcano eruptions , were significant enough to create extremely acidic rain , which could have affected plant growth			1
rain as acidic as lemon juice may have played a part in killing off plants and organisms around the world during the most severe mass extinction in @entity10 's history , 252 million years ago , according to @entity30 researchers			1
a forest devastated by acid rain is pictured the @entity14 is the @entity10 's most severe known extinction event , with up to 96 per cent of all marine species and 70 per cent of terrestrial vertebrate species becoming extinct			1
scientists largely believe it was made up of three phases , including a gradual environmental change and a catastrophic event			0
possible catastrophes include a massive chain of volcanic eruptions , fires from the @entity45 and a sudden release of methane clathrate from the sea floor , which is also known as fire ice			2
pin - pointing the exact cause of the @entity14 is difficult as much as the evidence created some 250 million years ago has now disappeared or is concealed within multiple layers of rock			2
a huge impact event has been suggested as a possible cause of the mass extinction , based on the examination of grains of ' shocked quartz ' and meteorite fragments in @entity61 , but no impact site has been found			2
one of the attractions of the theory is that it could trigger other causes such as the @entity45 eruptions			0
widespread ocean anoxia ( a severe deficiency of oxygen ) has also been blamed for the event in the @entity72 to the @entity73			0
the spread of toxic , oxygen - depleted water would have been devastating for marine life , producing widespread die - offs			0
models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and euxinia ( the presence of hydrogen sulphide ) would have been closely associated with high levels of carbon dioxide , which suggests a combination of gases acted as a killing mechanism			1
scientists believe the sequence of events leading to anoxic oceans may have been triggered by carbon dioxide emissions from the eruption of the @entity45			1
researchers at @entity30 investigated the theory for the @entity14 that volcanic eruptions in the @entity45 triggered a cascade of environmental events			1
they discovered that sulphur emissions were significant enough to create widespread acid rain throughout the @entity101 , with @entity103 levels reaching 2 - as acidic as undiluted lemon juice			1
they believe such acidity may have been sufficient to disfigure plants and stunt their growth , contributing to their ultimate extinction			2
‘ imagine you 're a plant that 's growing happily in the latest @entity72 , ’ said @entity111 , a postdoctoral researcher in @entity30 's @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
‘ it 's been getting hotter and hotter , but perhaps your species has had time to adjust to that			0
but then quite suddenly , over the course of a few months , the rain begins to sizzle with sulphuric acid			0
it would be quite a shock if you were that plant , ’ he said			0
geologists who have examined the rock record in @entity129 have observed evidence of a huge chain of volcanic eruptions that came in short bursts beginning near the end of the @entity72 period and continued for another million years			2
the volume of magma produced , was several million cubic kilometres , which is enough to completely cover the @entity13 this boiling stew of magma probably released carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere , leading to gradual but powerful global warming , according to the study , which was published in the journal @entity147			1
researchers investigated the theory for the @entity14 that volcanic eruptions in the @entity45 triggered a cascade of environmental events			1
they believe sulphur emissions were significant enough to create widespread acid rain throughout the @entity101 , with @entity103 levels reaching 2 the eruptions may also have released large clouds of sulphur , which ultimately returned to @entity10 's surface as acid rain			1
dr @entity111 , who is the lead author of the study , spent several summers in @entity129 collecting samples to measure sulphur and other chemicals preserved in igneous rocks			0
he used these measurements , along with other evidence , to develop simulations of magmatic activity in the end - @entity72 world			0
together with researchers from the @entity173 and the @entity174 , he simulated 27 scenarios , each approximating the release of gases from a plausible volcanic episode , including medium eruptions , large eruptions and magma erupted through explosive pipes in the @entity10 's crust			1
the researchers included a wide range of gases in their simulations , based on estimates from chemical analyses and thermal modelling			0
they then tracked water in the atmosphere and the interactions among various gases and aerosols , to calculate the @entity103 acidity of rain at the time			2
the results showed that both carbon dioxide and volcanic sulphur could have significantly affected the acidity of rain at the end of the @entity72 , which led to the @entity14			1
after the eruptions ended , the researchers found believe @entity103 levels in rain bounced back , becoming less acidic within one year			2
geologists believe the boiling stew of magma from the ancient volcanoes probably released carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere , leading to gradual but powerful global warming			1
a modern depiction of global warming is pictured however , with repeated bursts of volcanic activity , dr @entity111 says the resulting swings in acid rain could have greatly stressed terrestrial species			1
‘ plants and animals would n't have much time to adapt to these changes in the ph of rain , ’ he said			0
‘ i think it certainly contributed to the environmental stress which was making it difficult for plants and animals to survive			0
at a certain point you have to ask , “ how much can a plant take ? ” ’ the researchers also modelled ozone depletion resulting from volcanic activity			0
their results suggested that a mix of gases released into the atmosphere may have destroyed between five and 65 per cent of the ozone layer , substantially increasing species ' exposure to ultraviolet radiation			2
dr @entity111 hopes palaeontologists and geochemists will consider the results as a point of comparison for their own observations of the end - permian mass extinction			2
he said : ‘ it 's not just one thing that was unpleasant			0
it 's this whole host of really nasty atmospheric and environmental effects			0
' these results really made me feel sorry for end - @entity72 organisms			0

researchers from @entity30 simulated the @entity14 , the mass extinction even that made 70 per cent of terrestrial vertebrate species extinct
they believe sulphur emissions from volcanic eruptions created *deadly* acid rain , which stunted the growth of plants and led to their extinction
@entity272 probably released carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere , leading to gradual but powerful global warming , they said
