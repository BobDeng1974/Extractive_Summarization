' no matter what your philosophy is on someone who has an affair , if it was the man or the woman ’s fault , there are two people involved and if i ca n’t work , he should not be able to work , ' miss @entity11 told @entity20			1

' miss @entity11 met 54 - year - old @entity4 in @entity50 , @entity51 , when she was a news reporter for @entity5 affiliate @entity52			1
she claimed he led her to believe his 20 - year marriage to @entity54 was ending and he was therefore able to date			2
' i believed him with my heart , ' @entity55 , who is not married and does not have children , said			2
' you can say i was naive , as it was			0
that was my biggest crime , being naive ... i make one personal mistake and i am [ considered ] a worthless human being			0
' ruined : @entity11 claims she has been turned down by news networks because of the affair denial : when the @entity68 first revealed the affair , @entity4 said the pair were just friends @entity4 , a father who is best known for his show to catch a @entity73 , had previously claimed evidence showing his alleged affair was just a picture of him going out to dinner			1
