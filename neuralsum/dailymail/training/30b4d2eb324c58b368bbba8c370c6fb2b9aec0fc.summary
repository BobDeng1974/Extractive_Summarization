@entity1 @entity0 announced plans friday to take broad aim at president @entity5 's immigration policies and eliminate protections for immigrants brought illegally to this country as kids			1
the legislation to be voted on next week satisfies demands from the most conservative lawmakers and goes further than the approach initially discussed by some @entity1 republicans			2
that approach would have targeted only the executive actions @entity5 announced in november that provided deportation protections for millions of immigrants in the country illegally			1
conservatives in the @entity21 caucus pressed leadership to go further and also shut down a 2012 program that has granted work permits to more than 600,000 immigrants brought here illegally as kids			1
other changes would undo @entity5 directives to immigration agents aimed at limiting deportations of people with no significant criminal record			0
' the @entity50 people were expecting the leadership to step up to the plate and not just make some symbolic gesture in trying to address what the president did back in november , but try to go a step further , ' said @entity58 @entity57 rep. @entity57			1
' that 's what our language does and that 's what at the end of the day i think will garner a lot of support among our colleagues			0
' but the outcome wo n't have the support of a handful of moderates in the caucus , including lawmakers representing heavily @entity76 districts			0
' we 've got to deal with immigration , immigration as a whole			0
reforming our system across the nation , ' said @entity21 rep. @entity82			2
' just picking on the children that came here through no fault of the own i think is the wrong way to start			0
' the vote will come on a $ 39.7 billion spending bill to keep the @entity91 running past february			2
lawmakers said the goal is to keep the agency running on full funding – an especially critical goal in the wake of the @entity99 terror attacks – while at the same time blocking @entity5 's administrative moves on immigration			1
@entity5 's directives in november gave temporary relief from deportation to about 4 million immigrants in the country illegally , mostly those who 'd been in the country more than five years and have kids who are citizens or legal permanent residents			1
the earlier program , called @entity111 , applied to certain immigrants brought here illegally as kids , known as ' dreamers ' by their supporters			0
the immigration fight is coming to a head as @entity39 wraps up its first week of work for the year after convening under full @entity0 control			2
republicans deliberately kept the @entity91 on a short leash when they passed a full - year spending bill for all other government agencies late last year , so that they could deal with @entity5 's immigration moves with more republicans on @entity126			1
yet the dynamic does not have appeared to have shifted much			0
even though @entity0 now command a larger @entity1 majority , the biggest in decades , giving speaker @entity29 more room to maneuver , leadership still catered to the most conservative lawmakers in crafting the immigration bill , as happened several times in the last @entity39			1
indeed , some of the same conservatives who voted against @entity29 for speaker in a failed overthrow attempt this week were cheering loudest friday at the shape the legislation was taking			0
cold : @entity126 is getting chillier , both in its weather and in the mood indoors , as vastly outnumbered @entity142 struggle to figure out how to stop a @entity21 legislative onslaught ' i liked what i heard , ' @entity145 @entity144 rep. @entity144 said after a closed - door meeting to discuss the legislation			1
' i really appreciate the process of allowing all of us to have some input , ' said @entity144 , a frequent critic of @entity1 @entity0 leaders			1
' one of the things that has really been lacking for the last eight years is having more input like we 've finally gotten in this bill , so this is a good thing			0
' and even with the @entity34 under @entity21 control , minority @entity142 still exercise considerable sway , and there 's no guarantee senators will agree to the @entity1 legislation			1
even if they did , @entity5 could very well threaten to veto it			0
that leaves the ultimate outcome of the legislative dispute unclear			0
at the same time , @entity142 say republicans are courting electoral disaster in the 2016 presidential election by passing legislation that could alienate many @entity76 voters			0
' it 's nothing short of breathtaking that their first move coming out of the gate in 2015 is to attack immigrants and their families , ' said @entity182 , executive director of @entity183 , a pro-immigrant advocacy group .			2

conservatives got **budget** language that attacks the @entity1 's latest executive actions along with @entity5 's 2012 ' *deferred* ' deportation order
@entity58 rep. @entity57 's bill has been *shoehorned* into a larger **budget** proposal for the @entity91
@entity91 funding runs out feb. *27* because of a *compromise* the @entity21 struck with @entity142 last month that funded the rest of the government
@entity0 object to the president 's plan to mainstream 5 million or more illegal immigrants with residency cards and work permits
