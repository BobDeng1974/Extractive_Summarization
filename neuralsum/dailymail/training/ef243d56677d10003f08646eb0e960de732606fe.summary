by @entity0 for @entity1 footprints made by dinosaurs 200 million years ago have been vandalised by amateur fossil hunters			1
the tracks were among the best examples anywhere in the world and their precise location has largely remained a secret			2
but blundering fossil hunters have damaged the footprints by filling one with plaster of @entity14 and hammering it in a bid to remove their plaster cast			1
an investigation has been launched to assess the damage and track down the culprits			0
@entity36 - @entity35 , who is the founder of @entity37 said : ‘ i was horrified - these are some of the earliest dinosaur prints ever discovered			0
‘ they have been there for 200 million years but have been seriously damaged			0
‘ one print had been filled with @entity43 and somebody had deliberately tried to smash it out with a breeze block			2
the footprints are believed to have been left by three - toed meat eating theropod dinosaurs , which walked on their hind legs			1
experts have called for areas of special scientific interest to be protected from members of the public , between @entity56 and @entity57 ( pictured ) on the @entity59 coast the footprints were made 200 million years ago			1
it is thought they were left by three - toed meat eating theropod dinosaurs , which walked on their hind legs			1
some wider four - toed footprints are believed to belong to a plant eating dinosaur which would have walked on all fours			1
amateur fossil - hunters damaged the footprints by filling some with plaster of @entity14 and trying to smash it out with a breezeblock			2
they also lit fires on the rock shelf where the tracks have laid undisturbed since @entity31 times			1
‘ fires are also being started at the site , and rubbish left around			2
the public must be stopped going to the site now , before it is too late			2
’ mr @entity35 discovered the damage while taking a party of 10 students to the site at @entity86 , between @entity56 and @entity57 , on the @entity59 coast			0
the footprints are believed to have been left by three - toed meat - eating theropod dinosaurs , that walked on their hind legs			1
some wider four - toed footprints are believed to belong to a plant eating dinosaur which would have walked on all fours			1
the footprints were made by some of the earliest dinosaurs in the world and it is possible that ancestoral crocodile - like replies walked among them			1
at the time , the site lay in the arid north belt of the equator and @entity59 was a hot desert			0
deposits from flash floods , including rounded limestone pebbles within the sandstone beds can still be seen at the site , revealing its turbulent past weather			0
the rock ledge has been made a @entity114 and is of ‘ worldwide importance ’ because of the dinosaur tracks			2
experts from the @entity118 , the @entity119 ’ @entity120 and the @entity121 are investigating			0
there have been problems at the site before			0
in 2005 , experts discovered that a large area of thefootprint site had been dug up and removed illegally			0
slabs of rock with one or two footprints on them began to appear for sale on the internet and at fossil shops and fairs in the @entity134 and the @entity135 many were recovered and one man was cautioned , according to the @entity138			0
the footprints are believed to have been left by three - toed meat - eating theropod dinosaurs , that walked on their hind legs			1
the creatures are thought to have pre-dated velociraptors ( pictured ) , which were a small theropod @entity36 - @entity35 ( pictured ) said : ‘ i was horrified - these are some of the earliest dinosaur prints ever discovered			0
‘ they have been there for 200 million years but have been seriously damaged			0

tracks were among the best examples anywhere in the world
fossil hunters filled one with @entity43 and tried to remove the cast
fires were lit at the site , which has been undisturbed since the @entity31
tracks were made by three - toed meat - eating theropod dinosaurs
an expert has called for the @entity114 to be made off - limits to the public to protect the unique footprints
