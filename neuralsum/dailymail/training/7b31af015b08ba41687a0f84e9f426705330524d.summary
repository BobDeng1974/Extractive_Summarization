in a last ditch effort to stay his execution , lawyers are trying to prove that @entity1 , 53 , is mentally disabled and can not be given the death penalty			1
three doctors who originally testified for the @entity13 against @entity1 now claim that @entity1 is mentally disabled , and thus , should not be put to death			1
@entity1 ’s lawyers have continually argued that their client has had mental issues for the duration of his incarceration , and are doing everything in their power to spare his life			1

@entity26 died of his injuries			0
however , the @entity26 family has publically declared that they do not agree with @entity1 ’s execution			2
@entity1 ’s upcoming lethal injection goes directly against the 2002 case , @entity39 , which ruled that @entity39 was ‘ mentally retarded ’ and was not of sound mind , and therefore could not be sentenced to death			1
dr @entity42 wrote in an affidavit last week : ‘ having reviewed my earlier evaluation results and the far more extensive materials from the record of this case , i believe that my judgement that mr @entity1 did not meet the criteria for mild mental retardation was in error			2
’ the other doctors concede and claimed their evaluations of @entity1 in 2000 were ‘ rush jobs , ’ according to the @entity55			0
clemency : members of the @entity58 prepare to hear a clemency hearing for @entity1 last july the state has said that @entity1 ’s lawyers have failed to prove ‘ beyond a reasonable doubt ’ that the man is mentally disabled			1

@entity1 was originally scheduled to be executed in june , but the @entity69 allowed him a stay of execution while his attorneys pursued a challenge based on the state ’s changing of execution method			1

outrage : @entity102 was the last @entity13 inmate to be executed in the state ; his 2011 death was highly controversial even if the court finds him mentally disabled , @entity1 would still spend the rest of his life in prison , the @entity55 says			1
the case has stirred a national outcry of those believing @entity1 to be mentally unwell			2
if he is executed , it will be the first carried - out execution in the state since the 2011 death of @entity102			2

prosecutors and @entity121 's family said they were certain @entity102 was guilty and that justice was served			0
prison officials also provided an audio recording and transcript of his last words , which he used to again proclaim his innocence and urge his supporters to " continue to fight this fight			0
" @entity102 was notified of the execution date on sept. 7 , and a day later he was asked to make a last meal request			0
