@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 were left humiliated last night after commons speaker @entity3 survived an attempted @entity5 coup			1
the conservatives used the last day of @entity7 to lead a so - called ' @entity8 ' on the controversial figure			0
but the move was defeated by 228 votes to 202 yesterday and an emotional mr @entity3 appeared close to tears as he announced the result			2
the prime minister and his senior colleagues immediately faced criticism over the ' grubby ' plot – in which they wanted to change the rules to make it easier to remove a speaker from @entity7			1
as the speaker glared at the @entity34 front bench following the ambush yesterday , @entity23 ignored commons protocol by leaping to their feet and cheering the result			0
one of mr @entity3 's few friends on the conservative benches , @entity41 , wept as he gave a speech in support of the speaker			1
senior @entity5 said the debacle meant mr @entity2 was certain to be moved as chief whip after the election			1
he is being tipped as a potential party chairman			0
mr @entity1 , the leader of the @entity48 , was accused of damaging his reputation with what @entity50 called a ' grubby ' and ' squalid ' attempt to ambush the speaker on his final day in @entity7			2
the prime minister , who raced back from an election campaign visit to take part in the vote , also faced criticism from opponents			1
mr @entity0 , who has a personal feud with mr @entity3 and referred to him as a ' dwarf ' in a speech in 2010 , was heard declaring as he strode into the @entity48 : ' i would n't miss this for the world ! ' however , some of the speaker 's friends conceded it was clear that @entity7 is bitterly divided over his stewardship			1
they say he may now need to signal his intention to stand down within the next two years			0
former conservative vice chairman @entity73 , a critic of the speaker , said : ' the question now being asked by @entity23 is will @entity3 survive the confidence vote on the first day after general election ? ' unpopular with senior @entity5 and @entity26 ministers because of his intemperate outbursts , critics wanted to replace mr @entity3 with deputy speaker @entity81 or the @entity83 's @entity82 immediately after the election			1
commons leader @entity1 today defended the move which @entity50 branded ' petty and spiteful ' the coalition parties wanted to change the rules so that mps who vote to remove a speaker can do so in a secret ballot			1
that way critics could try to oust him without fear of reprisal if he survived , making his removal far more likely			0
the sway of a speaker over an mp 's career is such that few are ever prepared to make public criticisms			0
the rule change would also have brought the parliamentary practice of secret ballots in line with elections for the chairmen of @entity48 committees and those for a new speaker			0
labour sources revealed last night how mr @entity3 gave them extra time to draft mps back to @entity7 in sufficient numbers to save him			1
with @entity50 having already let many of its mps leave @entity7 early to take part in election campaigning , it initially appeared the government would pass the reform with ease			1
@entity0 was all smiles as he visited a factory with @entity125 this morning , but in the @entity48 his attempt to ambush mr @entity3 dramatically back fired but mr @entity3 's decision to allow three separate urgent questions gave the @entity129 crucial hours to haul mps back to the @entity48			1
some 23 @entity5 also voted against the government – saving mr @entity3 's skin – including @entity134 chairman @entity133 , former leadership contender @entity135 and former frontbenchers @entity137 , @entity138 and sir @entity139			1
the intervention of mr @entity41 , the @entity141 chairman of the commons procedure committee , appeared to help swing the vote			0
he was in tears as he told the @entity48 he had been ' played as a fool ' by mr @entity1 and mr @entity2 , who had failed to tell him that they planned to spring the move			0
' i have been played as a fool and when i go home tonight i will look in the mirror and see an honourable fool looking back at me and i would much rather be an honourable fool in this and any other matter than a clever man , ' the mp said			0
mr @entity1 defended the proposed reform as ' fair , democratic and thus completely justified ' and denied it was linked to any ' grudge ' against the speaker			0
' i think a secret ballot frees members of this @entity161 completely from pressure from their parties or from the chair , ' he said			2
@entity5 anger at mr @entity3 has been brewing for months , if not years			2
he has frequently clashed with mr @entity0 , who has often mocked his height			2
in april last year mr @entity3 tried to humiliate the pm in the @entity48 by cutting him off mid-sentence			2
during raucous exchanges at @entity171 's questions , mr @entity0 was shouted down by @entity23 and interrupted by mr @entity3			1
as the @entity171 tried to protest that he had not finished , the speaker hit back : ' he can take it from me that he is finished mr @entity3 also sought to humiliate home secretary @entity175 over government plans for a vote on @entity179 powers , including the @entity180			2
he frequently interrupts debates to berate mps , including frontbenchers			0
he told @entity2 to stop ' gyrating around ' and teased @entity0 's parliamentary aide @entity184 that his job is to ' fetch and carry notes and to nod and shake his head in the right places '			2
@entity5 mp @entity73 has been branded a ' silly man ' and @entity190 likened to a ' perspiring postman '			0
senior @entity5 mps got so fed up with @entity3 's rudeness last year that they formed what has been called ' the @entity197 ' , members of which complain they have been ' @entity198 * * * * ed by @entity3 '			1
they even created a lapel badge , featuring three bees , which they planned to wear in the @entity48			0
the design of the badge was calculated to poke fun at the speaker 's extreme phobia of wasps and bees , which is said to date back to his childhood .			0

prime minister wanted to ensure secret ballot on @entity3 's return
would have made it easier for mps to vote against him without fear
after clashes with @entity0 , one senior @entity5 said : ' it 's *payback* time '
@entity50 brands the move ' petty and spiteful ' on eve of general election
