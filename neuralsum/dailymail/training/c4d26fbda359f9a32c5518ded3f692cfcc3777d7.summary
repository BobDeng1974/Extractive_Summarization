perhaps it 's the threat of @entity2 's naughty list but a survey has revealed that the day of the year @entity4 are least likely to watch pornography is @entity6			2
@entity7 - which allows free access to millions of x-rated videos - analyzed their @entity4 traffic in 2012 last week to work out when they had the highest and lowest number of viewers			0
perhaps unsurprisingly , the days when porn was least watched are all holidays - with the top three being @entity6 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
turned off : a porn website has revealed that it got the lowest number of hits on @entity4 holidays @entity4 are least likely to indulge in their x-rated habits on december 25 - perhaps due to the distraction of too much family , too much food and too many presents			2
similarly @entity16 on november 22 - the day to be thankful does n't appear to stretch to indulging in porn			2
it looks like some porn fans ' religious obligations also get the better of them in early april as visits to @entity32 take a dip on @entity17 ( april 8 )			0
one - track mind : perhaps unsurprisingly online porn viewers dropped in number on @entity37 ... but there were still more people logging in than on other holidays ( posed by models ) @entity45 hits the list at number four , when it 's likely that last - minute gift - buying and turkey - basting takes precedence			1
christmas day ( december 25 ) 2			0
@entity16 ( november 22 ) 3			0
@entity17 ( april 8 ) 4			0
christmas eve ( december 24 ) 5			0
@entity49 ( july 4 ) 6			1
@entity51 ( october 20 ) 8 & 9 @entity52 weekend ( may 26 & 27 ) 10			0
@entity53 ( june 17 ) 11			1
@entity37 ( february 14 ) at number five is @entity49 , when @entity4 are presumably too busy celebrating their @entity49 freedom to bother with online antics			1
@entity50 makes an appearance next - suggesting a link between those who like to party to excess ( and pay the consequences with a january 1 hangover ) and have a predilection for online porn			1
next on the list this year was october 20 - the day when @entity51 struck the @entity65 and @entity4 had more far important things on their minds ( while several million internet connections were also down )			0
both days of @entity52 weekend saw a dip in those watching porn followed by @entity53			1
unsurprisingly , @entity37 sees porn viewing at an annual low - with the promise of real - life sex still preferable to that in cyberspace - however it does come bottom of the list			1
the most wonderful time of the year : online porn hits were at their lowest on christmas day , @entity16 and @entity17 ( stock image )			2
