@entity2 , who had celebrated his 17th birthday the previous day , suffered major chest injuries and died at the scene in @entity5 , near @entity6 , @entity7 , last year			1
@entity21 , 18 , a friend of @entity2 ’s who was the driver of the @entity22 , was not to blame for the accident as he was unaware the 17 - year - old had lain down in front of him , the inquest heard			1
@entity2 , a rugby player who had been at the party dressed as a @entity13 present , had a blood alcohol level of 159mg per 100ml of blood - double the legal drink drive limit of 80mg/100ml			1
several of @entity2 ’s friends told the @entity33 inquest that they had met up at @entity35 ’s home before walking the short distance to the party , hosted by local villager @entity37			1
@entity21 , who had only passed his driving test two weeks earlier , had been working that night and arrived late at the party - just 15 minutes before it ended at midnight			0
he was giving @entity39 and another teenager a lift back to @entity6			1
@entity2 and @entity35 , with friends @entity42 and @entity44 , both 18 , decided to walk the three - minute journey back to @entity35 ’s house , where they were all staying			1
as they walked along the lane , @entity21 drove up behind them and stopped			0
@entity42 and @entity2 decided to climb on to the bonnet of @entity21 ’s car and take it in turns to ‘ car surf ’ as he drove at walking pace			1
@entity44 told the hearing : ‘ @entity42 and @entity2 were both on the bonnet of @entity21 ’s car and @entity21 drove and @entity42 fell off and @entity2 got off			1
@entity21 drove off and so we carried on walking along the road			2
’ a minute later , @entity2 and his friends caught up with the @entity22 again as @entity39 had left his wallet at @entity35 ’s house and wanted to collect it			1
incident scene : @entity65 in @entity5 , near @entity6 , @entity7 , where @entity2 died the teenagers were talking to the occupants of the car when @entity2 lay down in the front of the car			1
@entity71 , assistant deputy coroner for @entity7 and @entity72 , recorded a verdict of accidental death , saying @entity2 ’s judgment had been impaired by the amount of alcohol he had consumed			1
‘ we heard from the pathologist that the toxicology revealed a level of alcohol that was nearly twice the drink drive limit , ’ mr @entity71 said			1
‘ we heard from a number of witnesses that @entity2 was in high spirits and was as drunk if not more as in previous occasions			1
‘ he was walking unaided and committed various acts , such as falling over deliberately and riding on the bonnet of a car without causing himself any apparent injury			0
‘ i heard evidence from one of the group outside the car , who had a clear view , that without warning or comment @entity2 lay down in front of the car while the driver was talking to other members of the group			1
‘ before the witness had a chance to say or do anything the driver moved off with the front wheels of the @entity22 passing over @entity2			1
due to the shouting of those from outside the car the vehicle quickly came to a halt			0
‘ there is no evidence to suggest that the driver was aware of @entity2 ’s presence or deliberately drove over him			1
‘ i note the conclusion reached in the collision investigation report that this was a tragic incident that occurred as a result of @entity2 placing himself on the ground in front of the car in such a position that the driver could not see him			1
‘ on the balance of probabilities i find that @entity2 ’s actions and assessment of risks that he was placing himself at were affected by the level of alcohol he had consumed impairing his critical judgment capability			2
‘ the appropriate verdict would be of accidental death , which is not in any way to trivialise @entity2 ’s death , but reflects the fact it came about as an unintended consequence of a deliberate act on his part			2
’ @entity35 , 18 , said : ‘ as i walked up towards my house and turned back , i saw him lying in front of the bonnet			2
i saw clearly what happened			0
i saw him lay down but no - one in the car had seen that he had gone to the floor			0
i thought he was joking about			0
‘ @entity21 was talking to @entity42 at the driver ’s window and i do n’t think he had seen @entity2 lying on the floor as otherwise he would n’t have driven off			2
’ the teenager told the hearing he did not have a chance to shout and alert @entity161 to the danger			2
he said : ‘ it happened so quickly			0
he went down and it was probably a second or two seconds before the car moved off			0
i think @entity2 may have been laughing as a joke but i do n’t think he said anything			2
’ @entity42 told the inquest : ‘ i think i said to @entity161 “ i think you ’ve run @entity2 over ” but i knew he had hit him and that ’s when @entity21 got out of the car			1
he was really shocked and did n’t believe it			0
‘ i bent down and touched his leg and tried talking to @entity2 but obviously there was no response			2
’ @entity21 , who had not been drinking , told the inquest that he did not know @entity2 had lain down in front of his car and described the moments before the accident			1
‘ @entity35 walked past the car first and then @entity44 came towards the front of the car and started messing with the front windscreen wipers and then both came to the driver ’s window , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity42 walked behind the car and started doing something to the car but i ca n’t remember what			0
@entity44 walked off behind the car and that ’s when i moved away			0
‘ it seemed as if we went over a bump in the road			0
that ’s when i tried to reverse and @entity39 said not to reverse			0
‘ we heard shouts from outside the car and they came to the driver ’s side of the car and told us what happened and told us to get out of the car			0
’ road accident investigator @entity206 , from @entity207 , read to the inquest extracts from the report he had prepared			0
he said there were no mechanical faults with the @entity22 and speed was not a factor in the accident			0
‘ @entity42 mounted the bonnet of the @entity22 , which @entity21 drove forward a short distance at low speed , at which @entity42 fell off the car but was uninjured , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity2 also mounted the bonnet and travelled a short distance before climbing off the car			2
having turned his vehicle around in the junction , @entity21 stopped in the junction having seen his friends approaching on foot			0
car involved : @entity21 , 18 , a friend of @entity2 's who was the driver of the @entity22 ( file picture ) was not to blame for the accident just as he was unaware the 17 - year - old had lain down in front of him , the inquest heard ‘ the group of young men reached the vehicle and there was a level of interaction around the vehicle , which could be considered as a distraction to the driver			1
‘ @entity2 then lay down in front of the @entity22 in a position he could not be seen by @entity245 of @entity2 ’s actions @entity21 drove forward over @entity2 and immediately stopped , reversing slightly before coming to rest with @entity2 beneath the vehicle			1
' i saw him lay down but no - one in the car had seen that he had gone to the floor			0
i thought he was joking about			0
@entity21 was talking to @entity42 at the driver ’s window and i do n’t think he had seen @entity2 lying on the floor as otherwise he would n’t have driven off ' @entity35 , 18 , friend of @entity2 ‘ @entity2 suffered a significant injury to his chest , aggravated by his position beneath the vehicle			1
