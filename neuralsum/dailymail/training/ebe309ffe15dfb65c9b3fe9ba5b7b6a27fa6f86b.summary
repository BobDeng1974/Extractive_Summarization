poised , composed and entirely regal – this is @entity1 as she steps into the @entity3 ’s shoes for a second time			1
her first outing as her majesty earned the actress an @entity8 , and her next is already shaping up to be a huge success			2
theatre - goers have spent £ 3.5million on tickets to watch her in @entity12 , which opens at the @entity13 in @entity14 on friday			1
likeness : an exclusive picture of @entity1 as her majesty in new play @entity12 , left , and @entity19 herself , right the play examines the @entity3 ’s relationship with her prime ministers during the weekly audiences held every tuesday at @entity24 throughout her reign			1
’ it ’s more like therapy than state business at times , ' said @entity30 , one of the play ’s three producers			2
‘ she ’s like the psychiatrist in chief , ' he added			2
‘ the play ’s about someone who has been around for 60 years and has seen everything and in the end nothing really changes			2
it ’s the same thing over and over again			2
' there ’s the similarities between @entity42 and @entity43			2
she ’s seen it all and what ’s kind of fascinating is that they ( the prime ministers ) come and make a lot of noise and bluster and they ’re gone , then it ’s somebody else			0
and she ’s had twelve of them ’			0
the @entity55 ’s exclusive photograph shows @entity1 , 67 , during the play ’s ‘ @entity56 years ’ when the @entity3 would have been in her mid-sixties			1
@entity1 was 59 when she made the movie @entity3 eight years ago , though she was playing a monarch - at the time of princess @entity63 ’s death -- who was 71			1
@entity65 : @entity1 previously played the monarch in the 2006 film @entity3 in the play the actress will portray the @entity3 from the time she took the throne in 1952 to the present day			1
she will be transformed from eager young queen to the present day ‘ grandmother of the nation ’ , to use a phrase from @entity12 ’s director @entity74			1
the @entity3 ’s look through various ages will be achieved using skilled make - up and hair designer @entity79 , costumes by @entity82 and subtle lighting by @entity84			1
‘ her voice has changed ’ , @entity1 told the @entity55			1
‘ she had a terribly posh voice when she was young and it has changed over the years so i can use that			0
but there ’s unbelievable consistency in everything from dress to hairstyle to professional attitude , ' the actress explained			0
' but there ’s been a lot of changes in her prime ministers			0
she has seen them come and go , ' @entity1 said			1
‘ in the beginning with @entity101 the @entity3 is the young , nervous , unknowledgeable one			1
' but as she progresses through them , they become the nervous ones			0
she ’s the one constant , through a revolving door of prime ministers , ' @entity1 said			1
for the ‘ @entity56 years ’ scenes , @entity56 will be played by @entity108			0
@entity109 , who wrote both @entity3 and @entity12 , explained that just one particular audience is observed with @entity56 half - way through her time in @entity112			1
queen once more : the actress is seen with @entity19 , who she will now play on stage in @entity14 's @entity116 , at a reception in 2011 ‘ it sort of gives an opportunity for them to explore their relationship both as leaders and as mothers , ' said @entity109			1
but also , he added , ‘ as women who are separated by just six months			0
they are women of exactly the same generation '			0
@entity109 refused to be drawn on exactly what occurs during the audience between the queen and the country ’s first woman prime minister			0
there has always been talk of tensions between them when they met but @entity109 suggested we ‘ might be surprised ‘ about what went on between them			0
however , not all the @entity139 will be given star billing at the @entity13			1
for starters , @entity141 does not have an audience with the @entity3 and nor do @entity144 , sir @entity145 , or @entity146			1
@entity148 got in by the skin of his teeth , the actor @entity147 was cast to play him very recently			0
those close to the play believe people are fed up with @entity141 and also that @entity109 wrote films that heavily feature @entity141 , @entity155 and @entity3			1
@entity109 explained that @entity141 has a ‘ presence in the play but not an audience ’			0
in any event @entity109 does not think history will remember @entity141 with ‘ any great affection ’			0
rather he ’ll be remembered , @entity109 noted , ' as a born vote winner in a telegenic age ’			0
@entity164 : the actress won an @entity8 for her performance as @entity19 in the 2006 film written by @entity109 reign : the new play at @entity14 's @entity13 examines the @entity3 's relationship with the country 's prime ministers over her years on the throne @entity109 also suggested that @entity141 has somewhat squandered his post @entity174 years			1
‘ not a great deal of public service more self - service ’ , he opined			2
but @entity109 believes the @entity3 ’s not ' a political creature and i do n’t think she has party preferences ’			2
he added : ' there are conservatives for whom she had great affection such as @entity185 , @entity101 , and @entity145 , and there are @entity188 prime ministers for whom she had great affection ; @entity148 and @entity190			0
‘ she was very fond of @entity185			0
i do n’t think she had much time for @entity146 , even @entity144			2
i do n’t think she particularly looked forward to her audiences with either of those gentlemen			0
