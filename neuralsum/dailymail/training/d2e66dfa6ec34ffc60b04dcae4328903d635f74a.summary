there will be no great explosion of fizz this morning as the @entity4 names the biggest ship in the entire history of her @entity7			1
that ’s simply because @entity10 will be doing the honours not with champagne but a bottle of @entity15 single malt ( after all , this thing has been put together in @entity17 )			1
yet , in naval clubs up and down the land , the corks will be popping - literally and metaphorically			2
for today is about much more than a colossal new addition to the fleet			2
it represents something of a renaissance for our senior service			0
she generates enough energy to power @entity55 , she can produce 500 tons of fresh water a day — and travel 500 miles a day , too			1
above all , she will be able to deliver 36 f - 35 lightning strike fighters and 1,000 troops from the largest piece of @entity62 sovereign territory afloat			1
her sister ship , the @entity64 , is already in production , though it has still not been decided whether she will be operational , mothballed or sold			2
this week , the defence secretary , @entity66 , described the project as a feat of engineering to match the @entity70			0
you could say much the same about the price — more than £ 6 billion for the pair			0
and that does not include the planes			0
these have been the subject of long debates , delays and a costly u-turn in 2012 when the government switched from a catapult launch system to jump jets			2
nor will they be seen at today ’s launch			2
a flypast using @entity88 f - 35s is off after an engine fire in the @entity88 the @entity33 is so large that she will not come down a slipway but ‘ float up ’ as water floods into her dry dock			1
and it will be another two years before she is fully fitted out and ready to leave @entity17			2
after sea trials in 2017 , she is due to get her first planes in 2018 and to be fully operational by 2020 , with a projected lifespan of 50 years			1
the name of @entity33 , pictured right , is covered with a grey sheet ahead of its official naming by the @entity4			1
@entity101 , pictured in the background to the left , will also be in dock during the ceremony since no photograph can yet do her justice , we have produced this souvenir illustration to mark today ’s event			0
thus begins a new era for a service which once ruled the waves but which has had a pretty dismal spell of late			0
old salts might trace the low ebb back to 1997 when the @entity118 was decommissioned and this ancient maritime nation found itself without a flagship			0
others say that the trouble started in 2005 when the @entity7 insisted on a politically correct bicentenary of the @entity124			0
the re-enactment of @entity127 ’s finest hour featured a ‘ red ’ fleet and a ‘ blue ’ fleet so as not to upset the @entity130			0
in 2007 , @entity62 was humiliated when 15 @entity62 sailors and @entity132 were captured , without a fight , by @entity134 in international @entity136 waters			1
released 13 days later , one of them admitted that he had cried himself to sleep when the @entity134 confiscated his @entity139			0
two years later , the crew of a @entity142 ship simply looked on as a @entity62 couple , @entity143 and @entity144 , were seized from their sailing boat by @entity148 pirates			1
and all the while , the surface fleet continued to shrink while the @entity7 was further eclipsed by events in landlocked @entity152			0
hence the understandable delight this week as the @entity154 , sir @entity155 , entertained the other services , politicians , diplomats and defence experts to a dinner in honour of the new carrier at @entity164 ’s @entity163			0
they heard mr @entity66 praise her as ‘ a vital message of confidence and capability as we plan for our future prosperity ; a formidable deterrent to our foes ; a symbol of solidarity with our allies and an advertisement for the @entity178			0
’ there remains one further challenge : squeezing this behemoth underneath the @entity182 and out to sea			0
@entity101 , top , the last of the @entity184 is dwarfed by the vast @entity33 next to her at @entity186 's @entity185 in @entity187 @entity33 , pictured under the blue crane , is the @entity7 's biggest ever aircraft carrier and at 65,000 tonnes is three times the size of the 22,000 tonne @entity101 , pictured to the left an armed serviceman stands guard alongside the vast new aircraft carrier @entity33			1
the @entity4 will officially name the vessel by smashing a bottle of whisky on the hull instead of the more traditional @entity199 the main dry docks at @entity186 's @entity185 are pictured from the air and show the huge beam of @entity203 , under the blue crane , compared to the @entity184 @entity101			1
the new £ 3billion aircraft carrier will be fully fitted out before being brought into full use in 2020 two workmen look up at the giant hull of @entity33 during the construction phase			1
it is due to come into full service in 2020 and will be @entity62 's biggest ever warship			1

the @entity4 will name @entity62 's largest ever warship today when she smashes a bottle of whisky against the hull
@entity33 weights 72,000 tones , is more than 900ft long and generates enough energy to power @entity55
she will be able to deliver 36 f - 35 lightning strike fighters and 1,000 troops once fully operational in 2020
