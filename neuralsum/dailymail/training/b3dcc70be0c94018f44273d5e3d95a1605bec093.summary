they were well - equipped in terms of their experience and ability to deal with any situation			0
' this was not some saturday afternoon jaunt by some inadequate vessel , crewed by inexperienced , clueless , and foolhardy people , who frankly have no business being on the water at all			0
' the potential for even greater and tragic consequences is in my judgement apparent			0
' he said , however , that @entity50 as a whole was safe			2
' attempts to call into question @entity50 in its present form are unjustified and unnecessary , ' he said			2
he added it was ' exceptionally busy ' in the @entity80 at the time and said : ' nobody sets out in @entity50 to have a collision , let alone with a tanker			1

' this case should serve as a reminder to all who use the water that a good lookout , a full appraisal of the situation and early action is essential to avoid incidents like this			0
' the court heard @entity2 joined the @entity3 in 2006 and left in february this year , but remains a reservist			2
the day of the collision was the fifth time he had raced at @entity181 and he had a flat on the @entity32 overlooking the @entity80			0
