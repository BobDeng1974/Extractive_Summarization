like @entity1 24 hours earlier , @entity0 found @entity2 too classy an opponent as the @entity5 side lifted the @entity6 following a comfortable 2 - 0 victory			1
the @entity0 were taken apart in the first half as the @entity9 struck twice inside three minutes and missed a penalty before the break			1
@entity2 were easy 3 - 1 winners against @entity1 on saturday and they again toyed with a @entity14 side here at the @entity15 in @entity16			2
should the injury prove serious , manager @entity25 could well re-enter the transfer market in search of defensive reinforcements			0
but the manager might also be concerned by the manner in which his side were torn apart midway though the first half			0
@entity43 scampered down the right and centred for @entity20 who flashed his header into the side - netting			0
@entity47 : the @entity0 keeper saves @entity50 loanee @entity18 's penalty in the first half of their friendly clash : @entity2 's @entity54 and @entity0 's @entity55 compete for the ball during their friendly in @entity58 but that let - off was a warning of things to come for the @entity0 and @entity2 duly put the game to bed inside three minutes			1
@entity20 made strides into the penalty area and took full advantage of @entity68 's half clearance before tucking beyond @entity47			1
@entity69 then escaped down the right flank and located @entity18 , on loan from @entity50 , at the far post and he did the rest with a smart finish , working room for the shot before curling into the far corner			1
@entity31 was guilty of a blatant block on the tricky @entity18 at the expense of a penalty on 30 minutes but the same player saw his weak effort blocked by @entity47			1
headache : @entity30 loanee @entity31 looks dejected after @entity0 concede their second penalty : the scoreline could have been worse for the @entity0 but their keeper , @entity47 , saved a penalty @entity0 : @entity47 , @entity31 ( @entity89 62 ) , @entity68 ( @entity90 78 ) , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity55 , @entity93 , @entity94 ( @entity95 46 ) , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 @entity2 : @entity99 , @entity54 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity69 ( c ) , @entity43 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity18 , @entity105 goals : @entity101 22 , @entity18 24 after the @entity107 went in search of his second and saw @entity47 palm over his vicious blast on 55 minutes			1
from the resulting corner the @entity113 striker looped a header towards the far corner and @entity47 was forced to backpedal and again shovel over the bar			0
@entity103 whistled an effort from range onto the roof of the net and @entity122 somehow lashed wide of an open goal from six yards as @entity2 continued to tease passes around the final third			0
@entity31 then over-stretched in a 50 - 50 challenge and hobbled down the tunnel to add to @entity25 's @entity128 – with summer signing @entity98 in attack – offered nought at the other end save for a @entity96 run on goal but his heavy touch allowed keeper @entity133 to slide and clear			2
@entity25 will now step up his efforts to bring in a new striker ahead of the @entity14 kick off a week on saturday			0
@entity136 is a possibility and @entity139 's @entity138 could emerge as a target should his contract wrangle persist			0
but with @entity146 out until november and £ 12million signing @entity143 set to miss the start of the season , they remain worryingly short of attacking options			0
tackle : @entity93 challenges @entity54 , @entity2 have now won all but one of their pre-season games acrobatics : @entity104 and @entity98 clash in @entity16 , @entity6 's home stadium			2

@entity155 opened the scoring for @entity2
@entity18 , on loan from @entity50 , scores @entity9 side 's second
@entity0 concede penalty , but keeper @entity47 saved it
@entity31 went off injured
