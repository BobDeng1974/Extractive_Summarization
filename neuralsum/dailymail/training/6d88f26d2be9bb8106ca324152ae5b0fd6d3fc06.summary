a new poll suggests that the majority of the people who voted @entity3 at the @entity5 elections will also vote for the party at the @entity7 less than a year away			1
in the @entity8 survey 86 per cent of the people who put their cross in @entity3 ’s box will do so again in may 2015			1
for the first time in its history the @entity11 did not come first or second in a national election beaten into third place by @entity18 ’s ‘ people ’s army ’ and @entity20 ’s @entity19			1
@entity11 ministers explained that away by saying that voters had merely ‘ loaned ’ their vote to mr @entity18 ’s party and would return to the fold in time for the @entity7			1
@entity8 ’s poll taken a few days after the @entity5 elections appears to show that these suppositions are misguided			0
the survey found that 37 per cent of @entity3 voters said that they were ‘ certain ’ to support the party at the @entity7			1
another 49 per cent said that they were ‘ likely ’ to do so , while a mere 14 per cent said that they would probably cast their vote elsewhere			2
the @entity8 poll was commissioned by @entity46 , @entity3 ’s biggest financial backer			2
mr @entity46 has also pledged to help @entity3 cause another major upset in this week ’s @entity22 by - election			2
mr @entity3 : @entity46 is the party 's biggest donor and commissioned a poll that shows that 86 per cent of @entity3 's @entity54 voters will stick by the party next may the @entity11 are so worried by another potential @entity3 win that on thursday of this week they sent five ministers including @entity59 , the chancellor , @entity61 , the home secretary , and @entity63 , the @entity64 , to glad - hand the electorate in the constituency			1
@entity67 and @entity68 have also visited @entity22 to try to bolster support for their party			0
walkabout : prime minister @entity67 ( left ) , @entity68 ( not pictured ) and @entity11 by - election candidate @entity73 ( centre ) visited @entity22 to persuade the locals to vote @entity11 on thursday the by - election was caused by the resignation of @entity11 @entity78 ( maj. 16,152 ) over a cash for questions scandal and at the moment the @entity11 lead @entity3 by 36 to 28 per cent but @entity11 support is down 18 percentage points since the @entity7 while @entity3 has gained 24 percentage points			1
mr @entity46 said that the @entity8 poll findings should make the @entity11 realise that @entity3 will threaten them at the @entity7			2
‘ conservative mps , with a few honourable exceptions , appear to be in denial about the scale of the popular uprising against our current rulers			0
this is despite their party finishing third in the elections , ’ he said			0
‘ they appear to think that the @entity3 threat will go away ( it wo n’t ) or that the economic recovery will float them off the political rocks			0
' they should recall what happened in 1997			0
then the economy had been growing strongly for four years			0
that did not stop @entity104 going down to the worst @entity11 defeat since 1832			0
