waiting times to be seen in @entity2 have soared to their worst level in more than 10 years , official figures revealed this morning			1
in the first three months of the year , 434,775 people waited longer than four hours in hospital emergency wards - some 4,830 patients every day			1
over the past year , more than 1.4 million people were forced to wait longer than the target time – compared to just 353,000 in 2009/10 – the worst on record since 2004			1
over the past year , more than 1.4 million people were forced to wait longer than the target time – compared to just 353,000 in 2009/10 the figures also show that 113,648 waited longer than four - hours on trolleys in @entity2 , and 983 over 12 hours			1
it is now 89 weeks since hospital a&es met their waiting targets			1
@entity19 @entity18 figures show that 92 per cent of patients spent less than four hours in the week ending march 29			1
this was down on the previous week when 93.2 per cent were seen within the time limit			2
it comes after the @entity24 last week confirmed the @entity19 has failed to meet its target every week of the winter , meaning the average for the whole year has not been met			1
@entity29 's shadow health secretary @entity28 said the government was the blame for the @entity19 's failure			2
@entity34 has overseen a record hump in waiting times to be seen in @entity2 , official figures revealed this morning labour leader @entity39 , arriving at an election campaign event in @entity38 this morning , has promised to bin the government 's @entity19 reforms health secretary @entity42 has promised to give @entity19 chiefs ' whatever they need ' after the election			1
mr @entity42 claimed a @entity47 government would find whatever money the health service said it needed to cope with the growing pressure on hospitals and gp surgeries			0
the @entity19 's chief executive @entity53 has said the health service needs an extra £ 8billion a year by 2020 just to keep standards as they are			1
mr @entity42 today vowed to find the cash – but went further by claiming that the government would find even more cash if they health service needed it			0
he told @entity60 's @entity61 : ' we will back the @entity19 's own plan in full , so we agree with the £ 30 billion gap , and we agree with the @entity19 when they say that if they can make £ 22 billion of efficiency savings the @entity19 would need £ 8 billion			2
' but they also said in that plan very clearly that they might need less than £ 8 billion if they can make more efficiency savings , or they might need more than £ 8 billion if they ca n't make those efficiency savings			0
' he added : ' we will give whatever they need , it might be more than £ 8 billion , it might be less , but the point is you can only have this discussion if you have a strong and growing economy			0
' ' over the course of this parliament , on the back of a strong and growing economy , we have actually increased funding for the @entity19 by £ 5 billion in real terms every year			2
' he said : ' after five years of @entity34 , @entity2 waits are at their worst level for a decade and patients are finding it harder and harder to see a gp			1
' there 's only one person to blame for the @entity2 crisis and that 's @entity34			1
he has made it harder to get a @entity94 appointment , cut council social care budgets and wasted £ 3billion on a reorganisation that nobody wanted and nobody voted for			0
' labour leader @entity39 , campaigning in @entity38 this morning , said one of the reasons behind the problems in @entity2 was that the coalition policy has led to 600 fewer gp surgeries staying open at evenings and weekends			1
he said : ' we 've just seen figures today published for waiting times in @entity18 's @entity2 departments which show that the first three months of this year was the worst period since the four - hour @entity2 target was introduced over a decade ago			1
' one of the reasons for that is it 's got a lot harder to see a gp			2
across @entity18 there are some 600 fewer gp surgeries open in the evenings and at weekends than there were at the last general election			0
one in four people ca n't get a @entity94 appointment within a week			0
' the @entity19 can not go forward if queues to see your gp are stretching backwards and i believe that @entity132 can do a lot better than people waiting day after day for basic healthcare			2
that 's what our plan will do			0
' but a @entity47 spokesperson said @entity141 were struggling because more and more patients were turning up at hospital to be treated			1
he said : ' @entity2 units across the @entity132 faced unprecedented demand this winter , but @entity18 a&es see 3,000 more patients a day within four hours than in 2009 , and perform better than @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 , so it is completely wrong for @entity29 to try to turn this into a political football			1
' thanks to a strong and growing economy we are investing £ 2 billion in the frontline next year to transform care in the community and take the pressure off hospitals			0
' @entity29 has been accused of ‘ hypocrisy ’ and using out - of - date figures after claiming the @entity164 has made it harder to get a @entity94 appointment			0
@entity39 said there were now 600 fewer gp surgeries staying open at evenings and weekends than before the next election			0
he said this was a direct contributor to problems in @entity18 ’s @entity2 departments , which has seen the @entity19 breach the target to see 95 per cent of within four hours of arrival for the 26th week in a row			1
the @entity29 has put the @entity19 at the centre of its campaign for re-election , releasing a poster today dubbed ' the doctor ca n't see you now ' , as @entity29 claim almost 600 fewer gp surgeries are offering extended opening hours to patients but the @entity187 pointed out that the @entity94 figures dated from 2013/14 – and did not include improvements in gp access since @entity34 pumped more money into the @entity19 last year			1
@entity42 , the health secretary , pointed out that @entity194 ’s botched gp contract of 2004 has allowed @entity195 to opt out of responsibility for their patients out of hours			0
and @entity198 leader @entity198 said it was a ‘ bit rich ’ of @entity29 to complain of funding cuts when they wasted so much @entity19 money in power			0
a string of medical leaders came out to say @entity29 ’s claims on gp surgeries were simply wrong			0
@entity29 ’s health spokesman @entity28 wants to re-introduce a target to ensure everyone can see their gp within 48 hours of trying to get an appointment			2
but in an embarrassment for the party , the @entity29 - run @entity213 government said it had no plans to introduce such a target in the principality			0
it came after the party launched a poster declaring the ‘ @entity187 have made it harder to see a gp ’			0
the poster reworks the @entity47 ’ 1979 ‘ @entity29 is n't working ’ image by depicting a huge queue outside a waiting room with the title : ‘ the doctor ca n't see you now			0
’ but mr @entity42 said the claim there are 590 fewer surgeries was ‘ wrong ’ , saying that the figures quoted only go up to 2013/14			0
he said the prime minister 's @entity234 – announced last year – covered 1,100 practices and helped 7.5 million patients see gps in the evenings and at weekends .			2

in the first three months of the year , 434,775 waited longer than four hours
over the past year , more than 1.4m forced to wait longer than target time
@entity2 waiting times have soared to their worst level in more than 10 years
it 's now 89 weeks since @entity141 met their waiting targets , figures show
