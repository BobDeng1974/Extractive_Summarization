@entity38 - 86.4 % @entity22 in 2014 in a report published by @entity21 , an aviation data service that provides flight schedules worldwide , @entity42 's @entity17 , @entity24 , @entity25 , and @entity26 all ranked in the top five of all airlines globally for on - time performance			1
five of the top 20 airlines are in @entity48 and the majority ( 12 ) in the list were @entity42			1
while @entity53 flagship airline @entity36 made it on to the list , along with @entity56 carrier @entity25 , @entity51 national airline @entity27 and @entity32 , neither @entity11 or @entity52 were included at all			0
of all @entity2 - based airlines , only @entity23 ( pictured ) and @entity16 made it into the top 20 do n't let this happen to you ! @entity21 has released their list of the best airlines for on - time performance rankings instead , @entity64 's little - known @entity17 snagged the top spot , followed by @entity23 and @entity24			1
to compile their rankings , @entity21 analysed 200 operators globally in terms of available seat miles in 2014 ( a measure of airline capacity that accounts for distance travelled ) and those that operated more than 30,000 scheduled flights last year			1
the rankings take into consideration ' mainline ' carriers , as well as low - cost carriers and regional airlines			2
however , airlines may wish to counter the claims of @entity21 , which judges a flight as ' on - time ' if it lands within 15 minutes of what is scheduled .			1

@entity21 has ranked over 200 global airlines for their on - time performance
in the @entity0 , only two carriers made the top 20 : @entity13 and @entity14
@entity64 's @entity17 ranked *highest* , with @entity23 close behind
