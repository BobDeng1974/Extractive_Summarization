by @entity0 published : 16:27 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 09:16 est , 29 january 2013 the @entity2 who refused to prosecute @entity4 's parents did so because he was ' too scared ' to put them on trial , it was claimed today			1
@entity6 did not indict @entity7 and @entity8 because he was ' in over his head ' , said @entity10 , who co-authored one of the most authoritative books about what happened			1
speaking exclusively to @entity14 , mr @entity10 said that mr @entity6 was ' embarrassed ' at the prospect of losing one of the most high profile cases in recent memory - so decided not to go forward with it instead			1
cold case : @entity7 and @entity8 , the parents of murdered beauty queen @entity4 , were indicted by a grand jury over her death , but prosecutors refused to press charges , it has been revealed unsolved : six - year - old @entity4 was found bludgeoned and strangled to death in the basement of her home in @entity30 , @entity31 , on christmas day in 1996 mr @entity10 co-wrote ‘ @entity32 ’ with @entity33 , one of the detectives in @entity30 , @entity31 who investigated @entity4 's death			1
he was speaking out after it emerged that back in 1999 a @entity31 grand jury voted to indict the @entity39 on charges of child abuse resulting in death , a felony that can carry up to 48 years in prison			1
@entity4 , six , was found bludgeoned and strangled to death in the basement of her home in @entity30 on @entity47 in 1996			1
sources , including members of the grand jury , told the @entity51 that mr @entity6 refused to sign the indictment vote and never publicly revealed its decision			1
as a result @entity6 and mrs @entity4 remained suspects until finally being exonerated in 2008			1
no - one has ever been convicted			0
mr @entity10 ’s comments threaten to re-open wounds that have barely begun to heal despite the passage of 14 years			2
experts : mr @entity10 co-wrote ‘ @entity32 ’ with @entity33 , one of the detectives in @entity30 , @entity31 who investigated @entity4 's death he has never spoken publically about mr @entity6 but said that ‘ this would be about the way i would expect it to finally come down ’			1
he told @entity14 : ‘ mr @entity6 was scared			2
he was in over his head			0
‘ he did n’t want to take these people into the courtroom			0
he was embarrassed they might be set free			1
' mr @entity10 said that mr @entity6 was ‘ known as mr @entity69 around here ( @entity30 )			2
’ he said : ‘ he was n’t ready for anything beyond that ’			0
mr @entity10 ’s book with former cop @entity33 was arguably the most sensational about the entire case			1
mr @entity33 quit the investigation in 1998 and wrote a scathing letter about mr @entity6 which he made public and explained in depth in the book			2
his resignation letter reads : ‘ it is difficult to imagine a more compelling situation for the appointment of an entirely independent prosecution team to be introduced into this matter , who would oversee an attempt at righting this case ’			0
mr @entity10 said that mr @entity33 is now ‘ living quietly with his wife and a little girl ’			2
he said : ‘ he does n’t want anything to do with this			0
he feels that a huge injustice was done			0
i agree with him ’			0
' last picture ' : @entity4 with her mother , apparently on the morning of her death			1
her parents remained suspects in the murder until finally being exonerated in 2008 horrific : @entity4 was found with her wrists tied above her head and duct tape over her mouth in a sign of how strong feelings are on the other side , a lawyer for mr @entity104 , whose wife died of ovarian cancer in 2006 , said that mr @entity6 and his staff were actually courageous for what they did			1
attorney @entity113 said : ' if what you report actually happened , then there were some very professional and brave people in @entity6 ’s office			0
' @entity6 , who left office in 2001 after 28 years as @entity121 's district attorney , has declined to discuss the grand jury 's actions			1
in 1999 when he announced the end of investigation , he said : ' i and my prosecution task force believe we do not have sufficient evidence to warrant a filing of charges against anyone who has been investigated at this time			2
' it is unclear whether mr @entity6 was required to sign the indictment			0
however , one expert told the @entity51 that in her opinion proper legal procedure would have been to sign the document and file it with the court before going to open court to dismiss the charges			2
defending accusations : @entity8 and @entity104 hold a picture of their daughter during a press conference in 2000 where they released the results of an independent lie detector test , which revealed they had no knowledge of who killed their daughter in a statement mr @entity6 told the @entity51 : ' @entity31 statutes , the ethical canons which govern the practice of law , and the @entity159 's oaths , instructions and orders in the @entity4 grand jury proceedings , are well established and absolutely clear with respect to the various participants ' legal obligations , duties and responsibilities , including the inviolate secrecy of the proceedings and the differing burdens of proof applicable to jurors and prosecutors			1
' as the duly elected district attorney at the time and as an officer of the court then and now , i must respectfully decline further comment			1
' it was on christmas day of 1996 that the @entity39 received a ransom note saying that @entity4 had been kidnapped and that the kidnappers were demanding $ 118,000 - the amount of a bonus mr @entity104 had recently received - or else she would be beheaded			1
it was not long before her body was found in the basement of the house			0
her wrists were tied above her head , and she had duct tape over her mouth			0
an autopsy report revealed that she had been strangled and bludgeoned to death			2
within hours , the @entity39 themselves became the chief suspects of the investigation and police were later criticised for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by concentrating on the family - including @entity4 's brother @entity201 - instead of following up other leads			1
basement case : this 1996 police video shows the basement hours after @entity4 's body was discovered for the next 12 years , the blame for their daughter 's death - who was given the name @entity215 - lay largely on their shoulders as they fought to clear their name and find the real killer			1
eventually , mr @entity6 ’s office completely cleared the @entity39 of any wrongdoing in their daughter ’s slaying and issued an apology in 2008			0
since then , mr @entity104 has kept the memory of his daughter alive , despite losing his reputation , a thriving business and his wife			0
christmas day , 1996 : parents of six - year - old @entity4 receive a ransom note demanding $ 118,000 @entity47 , 1996 : @entity4 found bludgeoned to death in the basement of her home in @entity30 , @entity31 @entity236 quickly placed her parents , @entity7 and @entity8 , under an ' umbrella of suspicion ' but they were never formally named as suspects detectives were later criticised for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by concentrating on the family 2003 : dna taken from the victim 's clothes suggests the family were not involved 2006 : @entity8 dies of ovarian cancer august 2006 : former teacher @entity4 reportedly confesses to the murder while being held on child pornography charges			1
but no murder charge brought after his @entity245 found not to match that on @entity4 's body 2008 : @entity30 district attorney 's office clears parents of any wrongdoing and issues apology february 2009 : @entity260 takes the case back from the district attorney to reopen the investigation he eventually found happiness through his relationship with fashion designer @entity267 , who he married at a private ceremony in @entity269 , @entity270 , in july 2011			1
last year , a former detective officially broke his silence over the investigation , saying that overlooked clues like cobwebs and a child 's toy could prove important in finding the killer in the high - profile cold case			2
in his self - published book , foreign faction : who really kidnapped @entity4 ? , @entity281 revealed thousands of pages worth of investigations and police reports			1
he said he wanted the truth to be out in the public domain , and has a theory that a children ’s toy could be responsible for the marks on @entity4 ’s back			2
mr @entity104 told police in 1996 that an intruder broke through a window in the basement			0
but in macabre police video that shows the basement hours after @entity4 was found dead , @entity296 pointed out that there are wispy cobwebs , moving ever so slightly			2
@entity296 speculates that an intruder would have brushed away the cobwebs upon entering the @entity104 ’s residence and thus @entity4 ’s killer would have already been inside the house			2
under suspicion : the @entity39 arrive at their attorney 's office in august 2000 to answer questions about the death of their daughter among those whose lives have never been the same after the @entity4 case is retired @entity30 chief of police , @entity315			1
he told @entity14 that he would still ‘ like to justice because this case was never solved ’			0
mr @entity315 said whilst there ’s ‘ nothing to prevent this case from going to trial ’ he has faith in the current @entity325 to make the right call			0
he said : ' the bottom line is this case is now as it was then			0
‘ there have been no charges in the case			0
my hope is that ( @entity30 ) district attorney @entity333 , who is a very capable @entity2 , will one day be able to do that ( file charges )			1
‘ the @entity104 case is one of a number of homicides that become unsolved			0
thirty per cent of homicides in @entity341 are not resolved			0
’ calls to mr @entity6 ’s home in @entity30 , @entity31 went unreturned			0
@entity14 reached out to mr @entity104 ’s former lawyer @entity344 but he has not called back			0
the @entity346 ’s office declined to comment .			0

@entity4 , 6 , found bludgeoned to death at home on christmas day , 1996
