by @entity0 published : 23:08 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 03:58 est , 22 july 2013 a @entity2 stuntman has pulled off the hottest card trick ever - blind - dealing four aces while engulfed in flames			1
daredevil @entity6 from @entity7 , east @entity8 , staked his life against his magic skills as he went up in flames			1
the 50 - year - old magician - who had roles in @entity13 and @entity14 - called it the ' world 's most dangerous card trick '			2
that 's enough to melt tin , so i had no room for error			1
' if the flame had come around the front because of a change in wind direction i could quite literally have lost my face or a hand and never have never been able to do card - magic again			2
' mr @entity6 , who served in the @entity39 special forces before becoming a stuntman , pushed his skills to the limit to replicate the pressure of being an underworld gambling cheat			1
these sleight - of - hand skills form part of his one - man performance in @entity48 in @entity8 's @entity49 , which tells the story of gambling cheats through the ages and how it has influenced magic			1
the performer pushed his skills to the limit to replicate the pressure of being an underworld gambling cheat mr @entity6 admits his friends and family think he is ' completely crazy ' doing stunts like this ' if a magician makes a mistake , it 's sometimes forgiven by the audience			2
if a gambling cheat makes a mistake , they will almost certainly lose their lives - and probably in a horrible manner , ' said mr @entity6 , who broke the world record for fastest abseil over 100m			1
' this was my way of trying to replicate the danger that they are under			0
' mr @entity6 , who is one of only 300 people worldwide to be an associate of the inner @entity78 , performed the crazy stunt at @entity80 in @entity81 , west @entity8			0
he wore protective gel and a kevlar suit to protect his body from the flames - but his hands and head were bare			0
he added : ' my friends and family think i am completely crazy doing something like this			0
but , then again , i have been doing this for 18 years so they are kind of used to it by now			0
' brave : although he was wearing a protective body suit , his hands and head were bare safe : firefighters douse the flames after the trick is successfully completed			0

the stuntman *risked* serious *injury* for *incredible* trick
