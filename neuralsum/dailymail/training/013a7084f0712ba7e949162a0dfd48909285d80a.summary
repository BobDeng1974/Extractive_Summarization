@entity0 does n’t deserve the blame for @entity3 ’s poor start to the season , according to former @entity6 star @entity5			1
despite earning three points against @entity13 on saturday , thanks to a late @entity9 goal , @entity3 , who finished second last season , are in the bottom half of the table			1
but @entity5 thinks @entity0 , and his much - criticised signings , who have failed to make the desired impact , deserve more time			1
@entity0 has been under fire after @entity3 's difficult start to the season some of @entity0 ' signings , including @entity22 ( above ) have come in for criticism from fans and pundits ‘ i do n’t blame @entity0 to be honest , ’ said @entity5 , who spent a decade at @entity3 before joining @entity26 in 1999 , and will be watching their next game , against @entity28 on tuesday night , as a @entity30 pundit			1
‘ last year , when the team was excellent , we did n’t really focus on @entity0 , we focused on how well the team were playing			2
‘ the fact that the team are struggling this year , people are saying it ’s all about @entity0 – but i do n’t think so			2
‘ the majority of the players who played last year are playing this year			0
players who were excellent last year probably have n’t reached that level yet			0
‘ he ’s brought new signings in to galvanise the team , a lot of the new signings have n’t worked yet.but a lot of those new signings are younger players that deserve a little bit more time			2
’ @entity5 says @entity0 should not be criticised for this season 's struggles after last year 's success @entity5 believes @entity0 is getting more stick than he deserves , and will turn things around @entity57 ( centre ) has not yet scored a @entity60 goal for @entity3 since joining for £ 16million and @entity5 says that if @entity3 can build on saturday ’s win and pick up some momentum , they can still finish in the @entity60 ’s top four			1
‘ i still think the @entity65 is an opportunity			0
‘ apart from @entity68 and @entity69 , the likes of @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , the teams that occupied those type of places last year alongside @entity3 , they ’re fairly inconsistent as well			2
‘ so i think if anybody makes a really good run of games , and wins games on the bounce out of those teams , they ’ve got an excellent chance of getting into the @entity65 spots			0
’ for that to happen , @entity3 need to rediscover the form that saw them score over 100 goals int he league last season			0
having lost @entity92 to @entity93 and @entity94 to injury , the goals have dried up , but @entity5 believes striker @entity96 should be given an extended run in the @entity3 team			2
@entity0 talks to @entity96 , who has begun to rediscover his goalscoring touch in recent weeks @entity96 celebrates his first ever @entity65 goal , scored against @entity101 last week @entity96 has scored just one @entity60 goal since his summer move from @entity104 , but has impressed in his last few games , scoring against @entity106 and @entity101 before providing for @entity9 to score @entity3 ’s winner against @entity13			1
‘ i think @entity96 needs to play , ’ said @entity5			0
‘ i think he needs to play games , he needs to stay in the team , he needs to know that he ’s going to be playing and he needs to build on a bit of form that he ’s got			0
‘ he ’s done well recently , he ’s been involved in goals and he ’s scored goals , he was involved in the goal on saturday , so i think injuries permitting he should start tomorrow			0
’ @entity96 should get a run in the first team with @entity57 and @entity94 injured says @entity5 however , despite travelling to bottom of the table @entity28 , @entity3 should not expect everything their own way on tuesday night			1
@entity123 ’s side scored five times when they beat @entity73 at the @entity125 , and have also earned impressive draws with @entity71 and @entity74			0
and @entity5 believes @entity3 could be in for a shock if they underestimate their opponents			0
‘ i ’d have thought they ’ll raise their game , like they did against @entity73			0
@entity28 were excellent earlier this season when they scored five times in a victory over @entity73 the @entity60 's bottom side have not won since beating @entity73 , but could raise their game on tuesday ‘ i think the place , no disrespect to if they were playing @entity136 at the @entity137 , but i think when @entity3 or @entity73 or @entity69 come around , the place will be absolutely rocking tomorrow night			1
‘ it ’s going to be a cold tuesday night , @entity3 will have played a lot of games in the last ten games , there ’s a really good chance for them tomorrow to get at @entity3 , and i bet you that ’s what @entity123 will be saying to them			1
' @entity5 is football expert for @entity30 who will show @entity28 v @entity3 exclusively live from 7.00pm on tuesday evening on @entity30 1			1

@entity3 are in the bottom half of the @entity60 table after 13 games
but @entity0 and his new signings should be given time
@entity3 travel to @entity28 on tuesday night looking for *consecutive* wins
if @entity0 ' side can build some momentum , top four is still possible
@entity96 can be the *man* to end goal - scoring *issues*
