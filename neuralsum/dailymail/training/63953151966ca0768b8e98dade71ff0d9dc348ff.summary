@entity0 , the false killer whale who was rescued off the shores of @entity4 , @entity5 in @entity6 , has been moved to a new pool at the @entity8 after a miraculous recovery			1
the large - toothed ' blackfish ' - which is similar in appearance to a killer whale but is a member of the dolphin family - has been in critical care at the popular tourist attraction 's @entity16 for the past five months			1
the calf was initially unable to swim on its own when it was discovered by locals off @entity21 on @entity22			2
@entity0 , the false killer whale who was rescued off the shores of @entity4 , @entity5 , has been moved to a new pool false killer whales have long , slender black or dark grey bodies with a narrow head and bulbous melon			1
adult males can grow up to 20ft in length , while adult females typically measure 15ft			0
calves such as @entity0 are generally six feet in length			1
the first night after his rescue , staff at the aquarium were unsure whether the calf would pull through , as he was unable to swim on his own			2
he reportedly suffered from ' worrying dips in heart rate and respiration , ' according to the @entity44 , and staff in wetsuits spent the night with him in the water , keeping him afloat			0
today , however , head veterinarian , dr @entity48 , is happy to report that @entity0 is doing well			1
the calf , who was found stranded in july , initially could not swim on his own during the first night since then , the oceanic dolphin has been in dr @entity48 's care at the @entity8 ‘ we have official permission from the @entity55 to move @entity0 to our larger research pool that is located at our facility at the @entity8 , ' said dr @entity48 in a video released by the aquarium			1
' it ’s just time to do that			0
@entity0 has regained a lot of strength			1
he ’s becoming quite a great swimmer			0
' he needs a bit more room			0
he also needs a habitat that we can control the temperature a little bit better now that it ’s winter time			2
’ for the transport itself , several staff members got into the water with @entity0 to move him to the crane - assisted device			1
@entity0 has made a strong recovery in the five months that he 's been at the @entity16 for winter , however , staff had to move the large - toothed whale to a different temperature - regulated pool ' sometimes [ transport ] can be a bit tricky , but we have a lot of great experienced staff who had done this with a lot of different animals , ' dr @entity48 said			1
and indeed the move was successful			0
' @entity0 did really well , ' the veterinarian said			2
' it was a really short transport but he did very , very well			0
' ' a little bit concerning just with the amount of time he was spending under water – it looked like he was a little bit nervous about the new surroundings so it took him a little while to come up for that first breath			0
' but he ’s kind of exploring			0
' he ’s not using the whole pool yet and i think this is kind of a new thing for him as well			2
lots of new noises and sights to be seen , so it ’s just going to take a little while for him to acclimate and get used to what ’s happening			0
' false killer whales are similar in appearance to killer whales but are a member of the dolphin family the move , though a bit tricky , went off without a hitch - with @entity0 hesitantly exploring his new home false killer whales , which are cetaceans , historically have a very low chance of survival if they become stranded			1
' it 's always touch and go with young marine mammals who have become separated from their mothers and rescuing a false killer whale is a new experience for us , ' dr @entity48 said			0
' very few veterinarians and other professionals around the world have experience rehabilitating stranded false killer whale calves			2
