by @entity0 archaeologists in the @entity2 claim to have found the world ’s oldest telescope			1
dating back to the 17th century , it could predate any other telescope known to be in existence			1
the find was made during digging works for a railway tunnel in the city of @entity12 in @entity13			1
astronomers in the @entity2 claim to have found the oldest working telsecope in the world			1
it will be on display in the city of @entity12 's @entity21 museum , which is being reopened by @entity22 on 23 may the small , cylindrical tin tube does n’t look like much at first glance			1
1608 - @entity28 spectacle maker @entity26 ’s patent application heralds the invention of the telescope			0
1609 - @entity33 astronomer @entity31 is the first to use a telescope for astronomy			0
1670 - @entity37 astronomer @entity36 creates a large refracting telescope that is 150 feet long and hangs from ropes on a pole			1
1781 - astronomer sir @entity41 from @entity42 discovers @entity43 with a hand - made reflecting telescope			2
1897 - a 40 - inch ( one metre ) telescope is built at @entity46 , @entity47			0
it remains the largest refracting telescope ever built			0
1917 - the 100 - inch ( 2.5 metres ) @entity51 telescope is built in @entity52 , and was later used in 1924 by @entity54 astronomer @entity53 to determine that our @entity55 was just one of many galaxies			0
1990 - @entity59 launches the @entity60 , which has since observed our universe in unprecedented detail			0
in fact , experts initially thought it might simply be a bullet chamber			0
but specialists from @entity68 in @entity69 confirmed it is indeed a telescope , if a little rusty			0
it was not , however , the finest piece of work at the time			0
the lenses inside were found to be of poor quality with a lot of unevenness			2
nonetheless the pocket - sized device , about four inches ( 10cm ) long , could still magnify objects by up to five times			1
‘ especially the frontmost glass is so primitive that it was hardly recognizable as a lens , ' curator @entity82 of @entity83 told @entity86			2
‘ but after cleaning , the telescope really works again			2
’ the discovery is significant as it comes from the @entity90 , a period during the 17th century when @entity2 trade , science , military and art were the most prestigious in the world			1
in the early 17th century the city of @entity12 was apparently a well - known producer of lens viewers			1
however , no telescopes are thought to have survived from that period - only some from the second half of the century have been found			2
but this telescope , discovered in a submerged ditch , could be the oldest yet			0
the reason experts think it is from the first half of the century is that it is a primitive tin scope of unknown origin			1
by 1650 , tin was no longer used for telescopes and much better glass was available			2
this suggests it was merely a gadget owned by an affluent citizen of @entity12			0
‘ the tin looks gilded in places , which points to the fact that it was a serious and valuable instrument , only in a time when the technique was not very advanced , ’ said @entity82			0
the telescope , dating back to the first half of the 17th century is about four inches ( 10 centimetres ) long and is made of tin			1
although it has undergone rusting it is still able to magnify distant objects five times the telescope was believed to have been invented by @entity28 spectacle maker @entity26 in 1608 , but it was not used for astronomy until @entity31 ( artist 's illustration shown ) in 1609			1

a telescope dating back to the early 17th century has been found in @entity12
the find was made during digging works for a tunnel in the @entity2 city
it is four inches long and can magnify objects up to to five times
but its tin *exterior* and poor glass suggest it is of primitive origin
it comes from the @entity90 when @entity2 science was the world 's best
