but @entity0 – who replaced @entity6 in october - offered @entity2 a lifeline and he went on to play a key role in @entity5 ’s journey to the @entity20 final and escape from relegation			1

‘ he helped us to get safe and we helped him to come back into football			0
in football these things happen			0
’ he went on : ‘ the first two ( @entity2 and @entity40 , who joined @entity41 ) that we decided to negotiate with , they did n’t work , because everybody was playing the waiting game			2
@entity2 will line up for @entity3 on tuesday against the club he spent six years at between 2008 and 2014 ‘ that killed us a bit , for whatever reason			1
it was not like we were not agreeing , but it all depended on where we were the following season and maybe then it became too late			2
‘ then players get an offer and sometimes it is difficult to equal as it is too much			0
that is a side of the game			2
it not about being greedy			0
‘ the problem was timing			0
‘ you tell a player we can not offer you a contract until we know we are in the @entity63 or the @entity64 and they will say it all depends			0
‘ in the end that is what happened with @entity2 and it was difficult for him			2
it is tough for us			0
it hurt more than anything because he is not with me , but if he is happy and his family are happy then i ’m alright because with it that is the most important thing			0
i hope we will see him on tuesday			2
