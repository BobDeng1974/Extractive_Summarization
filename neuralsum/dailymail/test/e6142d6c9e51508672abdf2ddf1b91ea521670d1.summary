@entity0 is on track to play a part in @entity5 's @entity4 clash with @entity6 after taking another step towards ending his eight - month injury nightmare			1
the 26 - year - old @entity10 international midfielder played 72 minutes for the club 's under - 21s and set up striker @entity13 for the decisive goal in a 2 - 1 victory at @entity16 on monday evening			1
it was his second appearance for @entity19 's side since recovering from surgery to repair a collapsed lung and while he admits he is still short of match fitness , he is in contention for a seat on the bench at @entity26 on saturday if head coach @entity27 requires him			1
@entity0 , pictured in @entity5 training last week , played 72 minutes for the @entity29 on tuesday @entity30 has only made one league start this season but hopes to be involved in first - team again soon @entity30 told @entity34 : ' the plan always was to be part of that game , to be on the bench			1
i played 72 , 73 minutes and hopefully i can be part of the team next week			0
' we will see what happens			0
i do n't think i could play 90 minutes yet , especially not on a level higher , so we will have to build it up and see how it goes			0
' @entity30 , a £ 6million summer signing from @entity47 , has made only three senior appearances and just a single league start for the club after first suffering a serious thigh injury and then being laid low by a recurrence of a lung problem			1
his battle for fitness has proved both gruelling and frustrating , and he is already looking forward to the start of the new campaign and launching his @entity59 career in earnest			2
he said : ' it 's getting a little bit better			0
i still feel that it just improves every day , but i still need to keep on improving			0
i feel it in the power training , but also on the field and in the game			2
' i just need to get a few more games in , and i think that will hopefully be a couple of games his season , otherwise start again good next season from pre-season on			2
' the @entity76 was a £ 6m summer signing from @entity47 but has struggled with injuries @entity30 was signed to help provide a link between midfield and attack and the kind of invention he provides has been sadly lacking for much of the campaign , particularly in recent weeks as a run of six successive league defeats has left @entity5 too close for comfort to the relegation zone			1
victory - something they have not tasted since february 28 - over the @entity90 on saturday would go a long way towards erasing any fears of being sucked into trouble , although with many fans in open rebellion over owner @entity97 's stewardship , it may do little to ease the tension on @entity99 .			0
