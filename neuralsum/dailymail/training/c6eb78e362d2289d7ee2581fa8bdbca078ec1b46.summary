a @entity1 yachtswoman believes she saw a burning aircraft over the @entity3 on the night that flight mh370 vanished			1
@entity5 , 41 , from @entity6 , described spotting what looked like a jet with ‘ orange lights ’ and trailing a plume of smoke			1
her claims add to mystery surrounding the @entity15 @entity14 , which disappeared on march 8 after leaving @entity16			0
the 41 - year - old , who had been at sea for about 13 months with her husband , had kept the spotting of the plane to herself as she was unaware of its significance at the time			1
ms @entity5 said she thought she was ‘ mad ’ when she spotted the fiery object in the night sky while sailing from @entity42 , @entity43 with husband @entity44 , 50			1
she was alone on deck when she saw the aircraft			1
' i was on a night watch			0
my husband was asleep below deck and our one other crew member was asleep on deck , ' she told the @entity54			1
' i saw something that looked like a plane on fire			1
that 's what i thought it was			0
then , i thought i must be mad … it caught my attention because i had never seen a plane with orange lights before , so i wondered what they were			2
@entity3 fireball : @entity5 and husband @entity44 ' i could see the outline of the plane , it looked longer than planes usually do			1
there was what appeared to be black smoke streaming from behind it			1
' ms @entity5 , from @entity6 , said two other planes were visible in the night sky			1
' there were two other planes passing well above it – moving the other way – at that time			0
they had normal navigation lights			0
i remember thinking that if it was a plane on fire that i was seeing , the other aircraft would report it , ' she said			1
' and then , i wondered again why it had such bright orange lights			0
they reminded me of sodium lights			0
i thought it could be some anomaly or just a meteor			0
' it was approaching to cross behind our stern from the north			0
when i checked again later , it had moved across the stern and was moving away to the south			0
' ms @entity5 explained that she kept her observance to herself as the long voyage had taken a toll on her marriage			1
she had n't spoken to her husband for about a week and it was n't until she arrived in @entity26 on march 10 that she first heard of the @entity33 tragedy			1
ms @entity5 said she told local yachties what she thought she had seen			2
' some suggested i should say something , that [ what i saw ] might have been it			0
@entity114 said that the flight was heading toward @entity116			0
i was n't sure of the date or time [ of the sighting ]			2
i am still not , ' she said			0
' i did think that what i saw would add little , and be dismissed with the thousands of other sightings that i assumed were being reported			0
i thought that the authorities would be able to track [ the plane 's ] gps log , which i assumed was automatically transmitted , or something like that			2
the 41 - year - old had been at sea for 13 months sailing from @entity42 , @entity43 to @entity26 , @entity27 with her husband @entity44 , 50 , and their pet dog a map showing the projected flight path of @entity33 crossing the yacht astern			1
this is just how ms @entity5 had remembered which then convinced her to file a report ' @entity139 , i was n't sure of what i saw			1
i could n't believe it myself , and did n't think anyone would believe me when i was having trouble believing my own eyes			0
' i did n't even consider putting out a @entity145 at the time			0
imagine what an idiot i would have looked like if i was mistaken , and i believed i was			0
so i dismissed it , and got on with the business of fixing myself and my marriage			0
' it was only when she heard some news on a radio report last saturday explaining that a survey ship involved in the search for @entity33 was returning to port due to technical problems			1
this is what prompted ms tee to tell her husband and then began reviewing her yacht 's log			2
husband @entity44 posted complete tracking data of the couple 's journey across the @entity168 on yachting website @entity170 after his wife told him of her sighting more tracking data of @entity44 and @entity5 's voyage across the @entity168			1
the couple reported ms @entity5 's sighting on saturday ' that is when we checked our gps log and realised that perhaps i really did see it , ' she said			1
mr @entity44 posted data maps of the yacht 's course across the sea on yachting website @entity170			1
it was then discovered that the couple 's 40 - foot vessel was near one of the projected flight paths for @entity33			1
the flight path was estimated during the initial search period , after experts realised that @entity195 defense forces had discovered a ' ping ' that could have been the lost aircraft			2
a map was created by @entity198 ' by using @entity199 to show the yacht 's position compared with the projected flightpath for @entity33			2
the map unveiled that the plane would have passed the yacht astern from port to starboard , which is just as ms @entity5 had recalled			1
' this is what convinced me … to file a report with the full track data for our voyage to the relevant authorities , ' she said			2
the couple filed the report with the @entity217 ( @entity217 ) on saturday and the @entity219 organisation tasked with co-ordinating the search for @entity33 in the southern @entity3			1
they also followed up with a second email to the @entity217 on sunday			0
since doing so , ms @entity5 wishes she had acted sooner			2
' will this help the authorities of the families get closure ? i have no idea			2
all i can confirm is that i have since learnt that we were in the right place at the right time , so it seems possible , but i chose to sweep it under the carpet and now i feel really bad , ' she said			0
' maybe i should have had a little more confidence in myself			0
i am sorry i did n't take action sooner			0
' no confirmation has been released by the @entity217 that they 've received the report			2
it is unknown whether or not the search body will investigate these claims .			0
