it was due to be a routine mission to examine the depths of the @entity3			1
however , researchers were stunned when their underwater robosub had an unexpected encounter almost 2,000 feet under the ocean			1
rather than the deep sea squid and corals they expected to see , a giant sperm whale swam to inspect their sub - causing gasps and shouts of ' holy cow ' from the sub 's operators			1
adult males reach 16 - 20 meters ( 50 - 65 feet ) in length , although most are less than 18 meters ( 60 ft )			1
females are much smaller than males , reaching only 11 meters ( 36 feet ) on average			1
the sperm whale 's life is based on sound			1
it finds food and navigates using sound and it communicates and stays in touch with its family using sound			0
sperm whales are listed as an endangered species under the @entity40 @entity39			1
the global population size is estimated as somewhere between 100,000 - 300,000 animals			0
' what the heck is that ? ' says one of the crew , when all of a sudden a massive object begins to appear on the screen			0
' @entity50 , ' says another			0
' at 598 meters ( 1,962 ft ) below the @entity3 off the coast of @entity54 , @entity52 @entity51 encountered a magnificent sperm whale , ' ' the whale circled several times and gave our cameras the chance to capture some incredible footage of this beautiful creature			1
' encounters between sperm whales and @entity52 's are quite rare			1
' footage shows the curious leviathan swimming in and out of the camera lights , at times spinning and looking directly into the camera			0
' you can see its eye , ' one of the crew says			0
' according to biologists we 've consulted , the animal on the video is likely a juvenile , especially if it 's a male , ' they say			1
' general consensus among the experts who have examined the video is that it is a male , though the video of the underside of the whale is grainy so it is difficult to know with 100 % certainty			1
' it was difficult to tell the actual size of the whale , the team say , but the @entity52 is 6 feet wide in the front			1
using this as a guide , and how close he was to the vehicle , it is estimated the whale was between 35 - 40 feet in length			2
the team also investigated the scarring visible on the whale			2
' it could be a number of things , including squid tentacles and suckers , especially the scars around the efface and mouth ; but likely not propeller scars like the comments made in the video			0
this neutrally buoyant yellow remotely operated vehicle ( @entity52 ) is the workhorse of the @entity120 , and it always used in tandem with @entity122 , it 's mothership			2
@entity51 is equipped with six thrusters that allow the pilots to ' fly ' it in any direction			0
it has two manipulator arms designed for collecting samples and recovering artifacts			0
video from @entity51 ' high - definition main camera is streamed up a fiber - optic cable to the control van on @entity120 , then out to the world			0
it is capable of operating down to 4,000 meters			2
' it could also be from other sperm whales			2
' they often jaw each other when playing or socializing			0
' sperm whales are identified with the scars on the trailing edge of their tails			2
' the whale can be seen inspecting the robosub in the video the researchers were piloting the @entity51 sub when the encounter occured			1

dr. @entity171 â€™s @entity170 / @entity169 are on their most ambitious expedition season yet , exploring sites ranging from the @entity3 to @entity174 through late september			1
over six weeks of the six - month expedition will be dedicated to exploration and mapping of the @entity178 and the site of the first hydrothermal vent discovery in 1977			0
the six - month - long 2015 season marks the transition of the vessel and operations of the @entity185 ( @entity185 ) to the west coast of the @entity40 and the @entity187 , concluding over two years of research in the @entity3 and @entity190 regions			1
@entity120 is owned and operated by the @entity185 ( @entity185 ) , a nonprofit founded in 2008 by dr. @entity171 .			0

@entity192 was exploring the @entity3 off the coast of @entity54
at 598 meters the sperm whale appeared in the robosub 's cameras
