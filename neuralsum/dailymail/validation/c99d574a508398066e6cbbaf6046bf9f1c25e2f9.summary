online music videos are to be given age ratings in a bid to protect children from explicit images and lyrics			1
top artists including @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 could see their music videos handed 12 , 15 or 18 certifications under the government - backed pilot scheme			1
the @entity14 , which is running the initiative , has estimated that one in five videos released will be deemed unfit for those under 12			1
video sharing sites @entity18 and @entity20 have signed up to the scheme and pledged to include the warnings on clips uploaded to their sites			1
@entity20 puts the rating in the top corner of the video , while @entity18 includes it in the information beneath however some of the world ’s raunchiest performers , such as @entity32 and @entity33 , are not covered by the scheme and there are no measures in place to enforce the guidelines rapper @entity39 has already seen his video ‘ @entity41 ’ rated 18 under the initiative			1
@entity46 ’s ‘ @entity45 ’ , recorded for the film @entity48 , was handed a 15 warning and @entity44 ’s ‘ @entity43 ’ was rated 12			2
but even with these ratings in place , there is nothing to stop younger music fans stumbling across the inappropriate clips which often include sexual imagery , violence and obscene language			2
only videos released by the @entity60 arms of @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity64 @entity63 are covered by the scheme and the companies are free to choose which videos they want to submit for certification			1
this means videos from artists such as @entity32 , @entity73 and @entity33 , who are not signed to those labels and are known for their raunchy videos , will not be included in the ratings system			1
video sharing sites @entity18 and @entity20 have signed up to the scheme and pledged to include the warnings on clips uploaded to their sites			1
@entity20 puts the rating in the top corner of the video , while @entity18 includes it in the information beneath			1
however , there are no checks to make sure the person watching is of the correct age			2
@entity18 is the world ’s most popular video sharing platform , with one billion worldwide users			2
it hosts videos for the vast majority of musicians			0
some of the world ’s raunchiest performers , such as @entity32 and @entity33 , are not covered by the scheme and there are no measures in place to enforce the guidelines a spokesman for @entity20 said : ‘ there is no signing in as such or filters – although this is a next step that may be added in time			1
at the moment this is about giving parents and users the information they need to make a more informed viewing choice and decision			0
to be effective it requires that parents also take an active interest in what their children are watching			0
’ campaigners said last night that the latest move is a ‘ fantastic step ’ but called for stricter enforcement and for all music videos to carry the ‘ kite mark ’ of an official age rating to help parents protect their children			2
the scheme has been running since october last year and has so far seen 84 videos rated , with 27 given a 12 classification , 39 a 15 and one a 18			1
the @entity14 has estimated that one in five videos released will be deemed unsuitable for children under the age of 12			1
top artists including @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 could see their music videos handed 12 , 15 or 18 certifications under the government - backed pilot scheme			1
@entity39 ’s video was given the highest rating because of ‘ strong bloody violence , gore , very strong language ’			0
the three and a half minute clip contains extreme violence with the rapper ripping the heart out of a stripping woman , brandishing a knife while covered in blood and decapitating a woman whose body then stumbles around the room			0
he also holds a family hostage and serves a cake with severed fingers instead of candles			0
he is shown pulling out a person ’s eyeball , slitting one woman ’s throat and cutting another ’s head in half			0
@entity163 , from campaign group @entity162 - @entity63 , said : ‘ when parents are surveyed , the two areas that came up as being particularly problematic were soap operas and music videos , those are the two areas that come up again and again as the issue			1
one in five , that ’s a huge number of videos			0
' what happens is one video pushes the boundaries and the next artists is under pressure to do the same in order to get people talking about it			0
it becomes a great merry - go - round and i think that is a fantastic illustration of exactly where this is gone , it ’s quite extraordinary			0
‘ it ’s not a magic bullet but it ’s a fantastic step and i think it will really make a difference			0
i do n’t know where we will end up down the line but i would like this to act as a kite mark for music videos			0
this is not a move about censorship , the videos will all still be there , but i think artists and record companies need to take seriously that if they are targeting young fans they have got to do it responsibly			2
’ on the lack of enforcement of the ratings , she said : ‘ you ca n’t go into a shop and buy a 15 rated film without @entity215 and we need to see about extending those protections online			2
’ @entity39 ’s video was given the highest rating because of ‘ strong bloody violence , gore , very strong language ’			0
the three and a half minute clip contains extreme violence			0
