sixty - six million years ago , a 5 - mile , vapourising upon impact			1
scientists have long believed that heavy dust from the impact blocked out the sun , setting off a disastrous chain of events that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs			2
but now researchers in the @entity11 have found more evidence for the theory that major volcanic eruption began just before the impact , possibly also playing a role in the extinction			1
researchers in the @entity11 have found more evidence for the theory that major volcanic eruption began just before the impact , possibly also playing a role in the extinction the team precisely dated rocks from the @entity23 - a region of west - central @entity25 that preserves remnants of one of the largest volcanic eruptions on @entity1			1
they looked for rock that might contain zircon - a uranium - containing mineral that forms in magma after an eruption , and that can be used as a very precise dating tool			2
the researchers collected more than 50 samples of rocks from the region representing the largest pulse of volcanism			2
samples from both the bottom and top of this volcanic layer contained zircon , allowing the team to pinpoint the timing of the beginning and end of the @entity23 eruptions			1
the team precisely dated rocks from the @entity23 - a region of west - central @entity25 that preserves remnants of one of the largest volcanic eruptions on @entity1 based on their analysis , the researchers determined that the eruption began 250,000 years before the asteroid strike and continued for 500,000 years after the giant impact			1
scientists at @entity62 and @entity63 calculated that the volcano spewed out a total of 932,000 square miles ( 2.4 million square km ) of lava			0
for two weeks , the researchers looked for volcanic rocks that might contain zircon - a uranium - containing mineral that forms in magma shortly after an eruption			1
it can be used as a very precise clock for determining the age of rocks ; the mineral typically crystallises in magma containing high amounts of silica and zirconium			0
the researchers collected more than 50 samples of rocks from the region representing the largest pulse of volcanism			2
fortunately , samples from both the bottom and top of this volcanic layer contained zircon , allowing the team to pinpoint the timing of the beginning and end of the @entity23 eruptions			1
the rocks were analysed separately at @entity63 and @entity62 to make sure the dates determined in one lab could be replicated in another lab. in both laboratories , the scientists pulverised rocks and separated out millimeter - length grains of zircon			1
to determine the age of zircon , and the rock from which it came , the teams measured the ratio of uranium to lead isotopes			0
the group ’s analysis indicates that the region of the @entity23 started erupting 250,000 years before the asteroid strike , continuing for another 500,000 years after the impact			1
the immense volcanism may have released dangerous levels of volatile chemicals into the air , poisoning the atmosphere and oceans , they say			1
' if models of volatile release are correct , we 're talking about something similar to what 's happening today : lots of carbon dioxide being emitted into the atmosphere very rapidly , ' said @entity128 , a graduate student at @entity62			0
' ultimately what that can do is lead to ocean acidification , killing a significant portion of plankton — the base of the food chain			0
if you wipe them out , then you 'd have catastrophic effects			0
' it 's long been known that a major eruption occurred in @entity25 around the time of the end - @entity144 extinction , but this event had never been precisely dated			1
based on the new , more precise dates for the @entity23 , the researchers believe the massive eruptions may have played a significant role in extinguishing the dinosaurs			2
' i do n't think the debate will ever go away , ' said @entity153 , a professor of @entity1 and @entity154 at @entity62			0
' the [ asteroid ] impact may have caused the extinction			2
but perhaps its effect was enhanced because things were softened up a bit by the eruption of these volcanoes			0
' before 1980 , the exact cause of dinosaurs ' demise was unknown ; one hypothesis proposed that they were killed off by massive volcanic eruptions			0
but the 1980 discovery in @entity173 of iridium , a rare element primarily found in extra-terrestrial materials , suggested otherwise			0
' the story that is emerging is that perhaps both might have been involved , ' professor @entity153 says			0
' perhaps the end of the dinosaurs was caused by a one - two punch			0
' the @entity23 are a large igneous province located on the @entity181 of west - central @entity25 and one of the largest volcanic features on @entity1			1

@entity11 scientists dated rocks from the @entity23 in west - central @entity25
they found major eruption began 250,000 years before asteroid strike
team believe volcanism continued for 500,000 years after the impact
@entity196 may have released dangerous levels of volatile chemicals
