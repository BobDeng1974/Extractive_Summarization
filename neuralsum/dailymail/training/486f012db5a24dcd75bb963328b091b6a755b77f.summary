images of the @entity2 ice shelf cracking up are an icon of the damage wrought by global warming			2
but a team of researchers from the @entity8 in @entity9 have found evidence that one ice shelf might have broken up before , 1,400 years ago – long before industrialisation had any impact on the planet			1
a study of sedimentary material on the bottom of @entity18 in @entity9 , found evidence of what the team described as a ‘ major fracturing event ’ 1,400 years ago			1
scientists believe the @entity25 ice shelf north of @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity9 , broke up and then re-froze 800 years ago they believe at least one ice shelf , @entity25 north of @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity9 , the largest remaining ice shelf in the @entity2 at 170 square miles , broke up and then re-froze 800 years ago			1
ice shelves are thick platforms of ice which have been pushed out to see by the pressure from glaciers			0
they act as dams in fjords and result in sediment building up at the boundary between fresh water from the ice and salt water from the ocean			0
researchers used carbon dating and other techniques to examine the sediment and were able to create a timeline of events			0
they found the ice shelf appeared 4,000 years ago staying whole for several thousand years before fracturing 1,400 years ago			1
they said it did n't fully re-freeze until 800 years ago			2
melting : a chunk of ice is shown drifting after it separated from the @entity57 off the north coast of @entity26 in @entity9 's far north in 2008 it began to shrink again almost 100 years ago and is getting smaller every year			1
@entity60 said : ' at this point , it does n’t appear that the shelf ice around @entity26 is any smaller now than it was during the previous period of warming , but because it ’s still shrinking , it ’s possible it could become , an ' unprecedented ' event			0
' the team published the results of their survey in the @entity70			0
ice shelves in the @entity2 lost more than 90 per cent of their total surface area during the 20th century and are continuing to disintegrate rapidly .			0

researchers think one @entity9 ice shelf broke up 1,400 years ago and then re-froze
