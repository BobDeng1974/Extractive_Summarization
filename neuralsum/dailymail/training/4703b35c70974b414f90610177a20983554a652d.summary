by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 02:22 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 08:57 est , 6 june 2013 split : @entity3 , pictured in @entity4 last night , faces deep @entity6 divisions over arming @entity8 rebels @entity3 is facing a serious split in his cabinet over plans to arm the @entity8 rebels , the @entity12 can reveal			1
at least six senior ministers on the @entity14 have raised concerns about handing over weapons to the opposition fighters seeking to oust dictator @entity18			1
cabinet sources say it could take 18 months of arming rebels to force @entity18 to the negotiating table – a bleak assessment which means @entity24 faces being sucked into a longterm military commitment in the world ’s most combustible region			1
the @entity12 understands that @entity24 is set to offer military training to the rebels and is also examining whether arms can be handed over too			1
but a meeting of the @entity14 last month revealed deep splits in the @entity6 over whether to intervene			1
deputy prime minister @entity33 , justice secretary @entity34 , development secretary @entity35 , @entity36 and faith minister @entity37 all lined up in the ‘ sceptic ’ camp , voicing concerns that military involvement could be disastrous			1
security sources say mr @entity33 told the meeting ‘ there is no military solution ’ to the war and that @entity24 should not act unless ‘ there is a wider political strategy that ’s supported by other leading powers , particularly the @entity49 ’			1
today mr @entity33 said a decision on whether @entity24 took action on @entity8 should be ' governed ' by the @entity49			1
speaking on his weekly @entity53 phone - in , he said : ' there ’s no perfect answer			1
if there was a perfect simple answer we would have sorted everything			1
what can you do if anything ? ' we have n’t taken any decisions about providing arms to the moderate forces in the opposition			1
' this is not a decision in any event the @entity24 should take on our own , this is something that has to be governed by what other big powers around the world think , notably the @entity49			2
' the ‘ doves ’ were supported by attorney general @entity74 has also warned mr @entity3 that he would be on ‘ safer ground ’ if he secures backing from the @entity77 – something that looks impossible since @entity79 , which has a @entity77 veto , is propping up the regime in @entity82			2
one source characterised the attorney general ’s intervention as ‘ being a bit like someone ’s wife , saying : “ why do n’t you think about this all the time ? ” ’			2
the source said the prime minister ‘ gets very irritated with @entity74 ’ and has already decided that @entity24 must step up its help for the rebels			2
‘ @entity3 got a taste for it in @entity99 and he thinks something must be done , ’ said one source familiar with the discussions			2
mr @entity3 has been joined in the hawk camp by education secretary @entity102 , chancellor @entity103 and @entity104			2
@entity105 : foreign secretary @entity106 ( left ) and defence secretary @entity104 are backing the idea of providing lethal support the defence secretary has called for any arms drops to be ‘ targeted ’ so they do n’t fall into the hands of @entity113 sympathisers			1
and he has warned that there are limits to what the @entity116 can do			2
mr @entity104 was recently present when backbenchers suggested that the @entity120 leadership could do with ‘ a small war ’ to distract attention from party discontent over @entity124 and gay marriage			2
‘ it had better be a very small war , ’ the @entity104 said			2
but insiders say mr @entity104 is ‘ very supportive ’ of the prime minister ’s stance that arms may be necessary			0
foreign secretary @entity106 has also come to the view that peace talks to resolve the crisis are ‘ doomed to fail ’ and is keen that plans be drawn up for military assistance to the rebels			1
‘ we have to prepare for the failure of diplomacy , ’ a senior @entity139 source said			0
‘ we will try to make it work but there is little hope that it will			0
’ momentum towards war was building last night when the @entity148 said they believe the @entity18 regime has used chemical weapons in the civil war , which has already cost 70,000 lives			0
doves : deputy prime minister @entity33 believes ' there is no military solution ' to the war in @entity8 and is backed by @entity157 minister @entity37 who is said to be against providing arms the full @entity6 has not had the chance to discuss the issue of arming the rebels and mps are clamouring for a @entity164 vote if arms are sent to @entity8			1
@entity4 sought to play down the suggestion that the @entity6 was deeply split on the issue			0
mr @entity3 's spokesman told a @entity170 media briefing : ' there is complete agreement on the approach we have been taking , which most recently led to the @entity24 along with @entity175 making the case for the lifting of the @entity179 arms embargo			0
' the spokesman added : ' the point of lifting the arms embargo has been to give us the flexibility to respond differently if we think that is the right thing to do , but no decision to provide lethal assistance has been taken			0
' mr @entity3 indicated yesterday that he would allow a free vote if the decision to send arms is signed off and that he would recall @entity190 if the decision is made over the summer			0
he said : ‘ i 've never been someone who has wanted to stand against the @entity193 having a say on any of these issues			0
' i supported holding the vote on @entity198 , in my premiership when there was the issue of @entity99 i recalled the @entity193 as soon as i possibly could and allowed the @entity193 to have a vote			0
‘ but this issue does not arise at present because we have made no decision to arm the rebels			0
’ but senior backbenchers have warned the prime minister that he would lose if it comes to a vote			0
‘ this is an @entity213 problem , ’ one former minister said			0
‘ they should sort it out			0
there is next to no support on the backbenches for getting involved in this war			0
’ allegations : the @entity77 @entity221 said conclusive findings can be reached only after testing samples taken directly from victims or the site of the alleged attacks			0
this image shows forces loyal to @entity8 's president @entity18 during an operation worrying : the aftermath of an air strike in @entity233 after the announcement about chemical weapons former shadow defence spokesman @entity236 added : ‘ i think the government would struggle to get endorsement in parliament for a policy of giving arms to the opposition in this civil war			0
’ in an echo of the build - up to the conflicts in @entity198 and @entity99 , mr @entity106 and mr @entity3 have begun holding private meetings with mps to convince them that they should support arming the rebels			1
mr @entity106 argues that failure to act will lead to a regional war sucking in @entity252 and @entity253 and fatally destabilise @entity8 ’s neighbours @entity254 and @entity256 , both of which have been inundated with refugees fleeing the war zone .			1

at least 6 ministers on the @entity14 have raised concerns
@entity33 warns there is no military solution to the *bloody* conflict
but @entity106 believes peace talks are ' doomed to fail '
