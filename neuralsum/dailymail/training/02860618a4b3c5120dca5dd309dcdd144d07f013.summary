money sink : punters can lose up to £ 300 per minute on fixed - odds betting machines now @entity23 warns people are losing their jobs and homes and turning to loan sharks and crime because they ’re hooked on the high - stake , high - speed casino - style games			1
last year , an estimated £ 607million was gambled on the 559 fixed - odds terminals in bookmakers across @entity23 – £ 1,302 for every man , woman and child in the city			1
unlike fruit machines , where cash stakes are limited to £ 2 , gamblers can use their debit cards to lose up to £ 100 every 20 seconds - more than four times as fast as the rate of play in casinos			1
the machines , which are highly addictive and have been dubbed the ‘ crack cocaine of the gambling world , lead to crime and poverty , say critics			0
but the gambling industry claims there is no hard evidence that electronic roulette games are dangerous and instead have promised a new code of conduct to allow players to limit their own stakes			2
@entity59 , the @entity60 councillor who tabled the motion , said : ‘ at the moment we ( @entity23 ) have n’t got the power to ban these high speed , high stake machines ourselves , but we want the government to outlaw them , or at the very least give us the power to try to stop their proliferation and bring the rate of play and maximum stake right down			1
‘ at the moment people can lose £ 300 a minute and £ 607million was gambled on these machines in our city alone last year - that ’s a staggering amount			1
‘ i ’ve heard stories of ordinary people , doing ordinary jobs , who are going into the bookies on pay day and losing a whole month ’s salary or wages in one session			0
‘ these machines are causing real problems in @entity23			2
people are losing their jobs , their relationships are breaking down , they are losing their homes , turning to loan sharks or payday loan firms and even committing crimes because of gambling			0
‘ those who say this is n’t a problem should listen to these stories and they will see for themselves that self - regulation is n’t working			0
@entity23 ’s vote is about localism - we need new powers to stop the @entity110			2
’ big draw : @entity112 has said that @entity113 account for around 80 per cent of its turnover according to recent research , bookmakers are becoming increasingly reliant on @entity118 for revenue , with more than 80 per cent of their turnover coming from such machines , compared to 20 per cent from traditional over the counter horse racing and sports betting			0
@entity112 announced that £ 5.9billion was staked on these machines from january to june last year , compared with only £ 1.2billion for over-the - counter bets			1
