by @entity0 inspiration : @entity2 in her nurse 's uniform at her own makeshift hospital during the @entity6 the socialite who was the inspiration for @entity10 ’s @entity9 refused an honour recognising her work caring for the wounded during the @entity6			1
@entity13 , the 5th @entity2 , who trained as a nurse and turned @entity15 into a military hospital , apparently did not think she merited the @entity17 offered in the @entity18			1
her decision is recorded in @entity21 papers obtained by @entity22			1
they reveal she was one of several female aristocrats who declined to be honoured			2
@entity13 , who was known as the ‘ pocket - sized @entity26 ’ , transformed herself from a flamboyant socialite into a tireless campaigner after the outbreak of war in 1914			2
she dug deep into her own fortune and equipped @entity32 – where @entity10 is filmed – with an operating theatre in one of the bedrooms and a recovery room next door			1
officers who were treated there recalled being served beer by footmen and described it as ‘ paradise ’			1
on one occasion the @entity2 , who tended the men personally , had to fire ‘ a pretty auburn - haired nurse ’ after discovering her ‘ in flagrante delicto ’ with a patient – future brigadier - general sir @entity47			1
these experiences – including the sex scandal – shaped the second series of @entity10 , which was screened in 2011			2
it showed the @entity54 family transforming their house into a rest home for injured officers			1
the current @entity2 , who is @entity13 ’s biographer , said last night she was unaware of the recommendation but was not surprised it had been declined			2
legacy : the loving and generous @entity62 ( centre ) in @entity64 's @entity10 was based on @entity65 she said : ‘ @entity13 was not the sort of person who would have wanted a fuss			2
she was one of a generation of women who just got on with it			0
’ the @entity21 papers show that the women were among about 760 people who turned down honours between 1918 and 1920			1
the files do not explain their reluctance but it is possible they considered such awards unpalatable after seeing the horrors of the @entity6			0
@entity82 , @entity83 , was a celebrated beauty who ran an ambulance unit and several field hospitals close to the front line			0
she turned down a cbe in 1919			1
transformation : @entity15 , where @entity13 lived and where @entity10 is filmed , became a military hospital during the @entity6 , which @entity65 funded with her own money and worked at as a nurse @entity94 , who turned her @entity96 home , @entity97 , into a hospital , and one of her @entity101 residences into a home for blinded soldiers , rejected an unspecified honour in 1920			1
her grandson , sir @entity105 , last night recalled family talk of her declining an obe			0
he said : ‘ she already had a title and did n’t want any more			0
the @entity110 family tended to be against decorations as a whole			0
‘ my grandmother was keen to play her part and she would n’t have given any thought to honours			0
that would have been out of the question			0
she was n’t that sort of person			0
’ @entity120 , creator of @entity10 , said : ‘ i am certain many of these women were genuinely modest about their achievements and did not desire to be what we would call celebrities			0
‘ it was enough for them to know that their work had been valued by the officers and men			1
’ he added : ‘ for us as a generation , unfaked modesty and finding satisfaction in the work itself – rather than in public adulation – are very difficult to believe in			0
but for these women , to be recognised in the street would have been torture			0

lady @entity144 turned @entity32 into hospital and worked as nurse
did not think she merited the award offered in 1920 @entity18
officers treated described ' paradise ' of being served cold beer by footmen
