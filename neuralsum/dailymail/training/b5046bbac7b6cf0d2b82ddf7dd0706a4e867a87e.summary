' i never imagined i could achieve anything like this in my career , ' the humble @entity0 wrote on his @entity19 page afterwards			2
' i 'll continue working hard to reach more targets			0

@entity30 ( 1940 - 1955 ) 251 goals in 278 games 2			0
@entity0 ( 2004 - ) 248 in 282 3			2
@entity33 ( 1981 - 1994 ) 234 in 347 4			0
@entity34 ( 1994 - 2010 ) 228 in 550 5			2
@entity35 ( 1953 - 1966 ) 227 in 329 10			0
@entity36 ( 2009 - ) 187 in 170 well , that 's very convenient because the maestro is within striking distance of a whole host of other records			1
in fact , we could see them fall in the next couple of weeks			0
@entity0 needs just four more to surpass @entity30 , prolific @entity47 goal - getter of the @entity48 , and become @entity25 's all - time leading scorer			1
@entity30 scored 251 goals in 278 appearances between 1940 and 1955 , while @entity0 has 248 in 282 - and counting			2
@entity9 's next league match is at @entity53 on saturday afternoon and the omens are pretty good - @entity0 has nine goals in six matches against them			1
if he goes on a scoring spree , he will also move one closer to the league record for hat - tricks			0
@entity0 flicks the ball over @entity62 goalkeeper @entity63 to open the scoring in their @entity26 meeting last march @entity0 rattles the ball past @entity67 during @entity9 's @entity26 match there in 2013 @entity0 with a characteristically composed finish past @entity47 keep @entity71 in a 2012 @entity25 game 1			1
@entity34 ( 1995 - 2011 ) 71 goals 2			2
@entity36 ( 2002 - ) 69 3			0
@entity0 ( 2004 - ) 67 4			0
@entity74 ( 1998 - 2009 ) 60 5			0
@entity75 ( 1994 - 2011 ) 59 1			0
@entity35 22 hat - tricks = @entity30 22 = @entity36 22 4			0
@entity0 18 @entity0 has scored three or more goals on 18 occasions in @entity25 but he still trails @entity30 , @entity35 and @entity36 , all of whom have scored 22 trebles			1
with rival @entity36 showing no let up in his awesome scoring record , @entity0 will really have to up the pace to claim this particular accolade			1
he is close to @entity30 's record for scoring two or more in a @entity25 game as well			1
@entity30 did this on 76 occasions , @entity0 has done it on 72 so far			0
with @entity9 travelling to take on @entity92 on tuesday , @entity0 also has an opportunity to further close the gap on @entity95 legend @entity34 as the @entity26 's all - time top scorer			1
@entity0 's @entity95 rival @entity36 is competing for some of his records @entity99 - 23 @entity100 - 26 @entity0 - 27 @entity101 , @entity36 - 28 @entity35 - 29 @entity0 has 67 in the competition , four shy of @entity34			1
however , in between on 69 goals is @entity36 and the next few years look like being a battle between the two to claim top spot			2
@entity0 is also one goal shy of notching 200 goals at the @entity27 but will have to wait until after the international break to try for this milestone			0
@entity9 take on @entity110 on october 21 and @entity0 will fancy his chances of getting on the scoresheet in that one			2
it seems inevitable that we 'll be celebrating yet more @entity0 milestones before the year is out			0
