a pensioner was stunned when he stepped outside his front door and almost walked into a six - foot wide spider web spread across his drive			1
@entity4 , 74 , was horrified to find the giant web , which stretched from his car ’s wing mirror to his shed , had a huge inch - and - a - half spider sat in the middle			1
mr @entity4 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , said he was ' mystified ' by the creation and how the spider managed to span such a distance			1
' i do n't understand how the spider did it , it was incredible , ' he said			2
' i 'm just mystified			0
' the spider itself was about an inch - and - a - half wide , we think it was a she because of the size , she was very big			1
' i have never seen a web that big before			2
' my wife would have actually passed out if she had walked into the web			2
there would have been a lot of screaming			0
mr @entity4 took the web , which stretched from his car ’s wing mirror to his shed , and moved it 90 degrees ' fortunately it had been a very dewy morning which highlighted the web so i saw it before i walked into it			1
' the web , which appeared overnight last thursday , disappeared after three days			1
@entity62 , of the @entity63 , said : ' it ’s almost certainly a garden spider ( @entity66 ) which are extremely common throughout the @entity67 at this time of year , spinning its large orb web in amongst shrubs and bushes in gardens and the wider countryside			1
' false widows : @entity67 's most venomous spider while garden spiders are completely harmless , there has been a spate of serious spider attacks in recent weeks , predominantly from false widows - @entity67 's most venomous spider			1
much of their reputation is thought to be thanks to the black widow , which although similarly named is far more dangerous and has been known to kill children , ill or elderly people			0
although its bites can be intensely uncomfortable - swelling hugely when infected - the false widow ( above ) is not known to have caused any deaths in @entity67			2
by comparison , around four @entity67 each year are though to die from bee or wasp stings when they have an allergic reaction			0
false widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny , black flesh , bulbous bodies , thick legs and skull - like patterns			0
millions of false widows , @entity67 's most venomous spider , are found across the @entity67 and the population is growing			2
also known by its @entity105 name @entity104 , its first @entity67 sighting was in @entity106 , @entity107 , in 1879 and is thought to have remained largely in southern @entity108			0
but the @entity109 says warmer summers mean the spider is spreading north , a theory backed by wildlife sightings			0
@entity114 , from @entity115 , was bitten three times on the shoulder and soon stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest			0
and @entity120 , 33 , from @entity121 , @entity122 , was bitten in pub garden and rushed to hospital after her leg turned black , yellow and blistered .			0

@entity4 , 74 , found the web when he went to work in his garage
*sitting* in the middle of the web was an inch - and - half garden spider
appeared overnight in @entity10 , @entity11 , and disappeared three days later
