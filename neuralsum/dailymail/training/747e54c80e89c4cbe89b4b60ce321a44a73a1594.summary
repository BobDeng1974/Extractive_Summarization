@entity12 has created a portable heads - up display ( @entity14 ) that sits on a car 's dashboard and projects turn - by - turn directions on a transparent film attached to the windscreen			1
the directions are sent to the @entity14 over @entity22 from a smartphone running the @entity24 or @entity26 satellite navigation apps			1
satnav firm @entity12 has created a portable device , pictured , that sits on a car 's dashboard and can project turn - by - turn directions onto the windscreen			1
the directions are sent to the heads - up display using a smartphone app and projected onto a transparent film attached to the screen the @entity14 automatically adjusts the brightness level of the directions based on the light conditions at the time			1
this makes sure the projections are clearly visible in direct sunlight or at night , pictured the @entity14 can connect to any bluetooth - enabled device including smartphones and tablets			2
the driver then plots their route on the phone or tablet using either the @entity52 or @entity26 satellite navigation apps			1
turn - by - turn directions are sent wirelessly to the @entity14			1
these directions are then beamed from the projector onto a transparent plastic film stuck to the inside of the windscreen			0
alternatively , the directions can be shown on a reflector lens attached directly to the @entity14			0
@entity12 's @entity14 shows turning arrows , the distance to the next turn , the current driving speed as well as the estimated time of arrival			1
it even lets drivers know what lane to be in , warns of potential traffic delays and shows the location of nearby speed cameras			0
@entity12 's @entity14 shows turning arrows , the distance to the next turn , the current driving speed as well as the estimated time of arrival			1
it even lets drivers know what lane to be in , warns of potential traffic delays and shows the location of nearby speed cameras			0
spoken turn - by - turn directions can also be enabled and are played out either through the smartphone 's speakers , or via @entity22 through the car 's stereo			1
if music is being streamed to the car stereo from the smartphone at the same time the @entity14 will automatically fade it out for the turn - by - turn voice prompts			2
the @entity14 will also continue to display directions if the driver takes a call on a hands - free kit			2
if drivers do n't want to beam the directions onto the plastic film they can instead project them through a reflector lens that connects directly to the @entity14			0
the @entity14 automatically adjusts the brightness level when using the film , or the lens , to make sure projections can be seen clearly in direct sunlight or at night			0
' @entity14 redefines the navigation experience by allowing drivers to find their way without taking their eyes off the road , ' said @entity101 , @entity12 vice president of worldwide sales			2
@entity12 's @entity14 displays turn arrows , the distance to the next turn , the current speed and speed limits as well as the estimated time of arrival			2
it even lets drivers know what lane to be in and warns them about potential traffic delays and safety camera locations @entity12 's @entity14 works with the @entity52 app , pictured , as well as the @entity26 satnav app ' head - up displays currently have their place in select high - end cars , but @entity14 makes this technology available as an aftermarket accessory for any vehicle , at an affordable price			1
' @entity12 's latest device gets its directions from the @entity24 and @entity26 apps that are available on @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity127 handsets			1
the @entity14 will go on sale in september and cost £ 139			1
commenting on the device , @entity130 's technical director @entity129 told @entity132 : ' there has been a good deal of interest in this kind of technology and we need to look more closely at how motorists would use it on a day - to - day basis			0
' however , it is certainly true that current satnav screens can be a distraction and if poorly positioned can both obscure vision and cause drivers to take their eyes off the road			0
' we know that head - up displays are commonly used for military aircraft because they enable the pilot to continue to look ahead without having to divert their gaze down to look at numbers and dials			0
' in principle , therefore , a head - up display for satnav is a good idea – provided it is located in a position that allows the driver an unhindered view of the road ahead and operates in a way that does not distract the driver			0
' a recent study from the @entity167 in the @entity168 found that hands - free kits - such as @entity12 's @entity14 - can cause an ' extensive risk ' to drivers and pedestrians			2
the findings even suggests they may be no safer than using a phone			0
the research found that dangerous mental distractions exist even when drivers keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road			0
as mental workload and distractions increase , reaction times get slower and brain function while driving is compromised			0
this results in drivers scanning the road less and potentially not seeing items right in front of them , including pedestrians			0
the @entity14 , pictured , is due to go on sale in september and will cost £ 139			1
the device projects turn - by - turn directions onto a transparent film stuck to the inside of the windshield or via an attached reflector lens			2

the directions are wirelessly sent to the device using a smartphone
it costs £ 139 and works with the @entity52 app
