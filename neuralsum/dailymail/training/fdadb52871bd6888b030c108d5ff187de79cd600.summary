by @entity0 published : 06:11 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 07:36 est , 20 march 2013 former @entity2 commander @entity1 has lifted the lid on how astronauts aboard go to the toilet in space			1
personnel aboard the @entity2 often spend months at a time in space , so effective facilities for using the smallest room in zero gravity are essential			2
captain @entity1 , who holds the record for the longest space flight by a woman at 195 days , revealed details of the ' orbital outhouse ' in a video tour of the station			1
stinky : former @entity2 commander @entity1 demonstrates the orbiter 's smallest room in space in a @entity23 video her tour of the Â£ 12.5million facilities showed that it is apparently all a case of docking and alignment when it comes to going to the toilet in space			1
the toilet , she explains , unsurprisingly ' serves for two functions ' - number one and number two - with different colour - coded receptacles to accept each			2
pointing out the number two loo , she says : ' you see it 's pretty small and you have to have pretty good aim , and be ready to make sure things get let go in the right direction			0
' pinching her nose , she adds : ' and it smells a little bit , so i 'm closing it up			0
' this is for number ones ... captain @entity1 holds up the colour - coded tube where astronauts urinate and this is for number two : both units have suction ' to keep things going in the right direction ' , she revealed ' also there 's a selection of paper , ' she says , including a soft kind for @entity64 astronauts and a coarser , rough variety preferred by @entity67 cosmonauts			1
captain @entity1 , a @entity68 test pilot pilot who has over seven missions spend a total of almost 322 days in space , says the crew are provided with gloves , nappies and disinfectant wipes , ' in case things really get out of control '			1
' the number one stuff can get really all over the place if you do n't aim correctly , ' she warns			0
although , she adds , both toilets have a little bit of suction to keep things ' going in the right direction '			0
for that fresh feeling : captain @entity1 points out the baby wipes made available for astronauts a little privacy please ... captain @entity1 slides shut the folding door that preserves astronauts ' modesty of course , that 's assuming that all the high - tech components aboard the @entity2 keep working as designed			1
in 2009 there was a crisis aboard the station when its main toilet broke down with a record 13 people aboard			2
one of the pumps in the crew 's main bathroom flooded , which is connected to the station 's wastewater - recycling system			0
astronauts were forced to don goggles , gloves and masks for some impromptu plumbing			0
they ripped apart the compartment , working well into the evening but failed to solve the problem until spare parts were sent from @entity114 .			0

captain @entity1 hosts a video tour around the stations facilities
different receptacles are used for ' ones ' and ' twos ' , she reveals
she also reveals how @entity67 prefer coarser , rougher toilet paper
the toilet is *equipped* with range of wipes ' in case things get out of control '
*current* space station commander @entity131 revealed in a @entity132 last year that astronauts on space walks use *special* ' *absorbent* *undergarments* ' if *overcome* by a call of nature during a space walk .
