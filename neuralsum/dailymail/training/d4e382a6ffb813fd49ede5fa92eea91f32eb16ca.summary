new @entity1 manager @entity0 says that he has been promised transfer funds by chairman @entity3 in a bid to stave off relegation from the @entity6			1
@entity1 , third from bottom , have an interest in taking @entity11 ’s @entity10 on loan or perhaps signing @entity13 from @entity14 and @entity0 is clear the squad will need improvements this month if the club are to achieve their principal goal of staying up			1
@entity0 was confirmed as @entity1 manager on saturday and will take charge for their @entity22 third - round clash at @entity23 on sunday after watching the team draw 0 - 0 at @entity25 on @entity26			1
@entity0 has been unveiled as @entity1 's new manager after leaving @entity28 @entity28 confirmed the departure of their former manager on saturday morning speaking publicly for the first time since his shock departure from @entity28 last week , @entity0 said : ‘ without putting pressure on the chairman — because i think it ’s difficult for the manager to keep talking publicly about players and putting unnecessary pressure on the board — we have had discussions and we are going to need a player or two at least and that is what we ’re going to try to do			1
‘ maybe it just needs a little change of direction			0
the players have a great attitude here			0
i ’ve been really , really impressed with them			0
‘ so can i help change that energy into more tangible results ? that might take a transfer or a change of style a little bit and that ’s really what a manager of my experience can hopefully do			2
’ although former @entity1 manager @entity60 became frustrated with the club ’s transfer strategy , @entity0 is likely to enjoy a better relationship with parish than he did with @entity65 at @entity28 , where he had little say over which players came and went			1

he wants his owner to feel part of the management process , believing it helps deal with poor results or other difficult situations at the club			2
@entity0 did the same with @entity65 at @entity28 but the frustration over transfer policy and the antipathy of @entity28 fans seems to have persuaded him to move back to the club he played for between 1987 and 1991			1
he became a fans ’ favourite , scoring the winner in the dramatic 4 - 3 win over @entity99 in the 1990 @entity22 semi-final			0
‘ it was difficult because i ’m leaving a big club in @entity28 , ’ he said			2
‘ it was a choice i decided to make which i felt was good for myself and for my family and my career			0
caretaker boss @entity106 took charge of @entity1 's 0 - 0 draw at @entity25 on @entity26 @entity0 will lead his first game with @entity1 after they agreed a £ 3.5million compensation deal with @entity28 ‘ every time i ’ve come back here it was always a lovely welcome and a nice feeling			1
i knew at some point i was sure i would have worked in this club			2
‘ really and truly my home is in this area and for me it ’s what you would class , as close as you can be as a manager , to my own club			2
’ ‘ fans love you when you do something good for the football club and i think they admired the spirit and the way we approached games in that era and would like to see a little bit more of that and i hope i can bring that back			0
the club has done incredibly well in the last couple of years			0
it ’s a little bit sticky at the moment			0
and we need to find a route out of that			0
