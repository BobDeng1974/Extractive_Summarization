@entity0 analyses what we learned from the third round of the @entity4 as the @entity6 sides entered the famous old tournament			1
@entity9 ’s injury woes have handed @entity10 a chance to prove his worth			1
despite first signing for the @entity15 in 2008 , the @entity4 tie with @entity14 was the first time the @entity18 midfielder had ever started three games in a row			1
the 23 - year - old did well enough in the holding role to suggest he ’ll play some more while @entity23 tries to get other midfielders fit			0
but @entity10 will be glad the january 1 disciplinary deadline for five bookings earning a suspension has come and gone			2
his yellow card in the 2 - 0 win was his fourth in as many appearances			1
@entity10 ( left ) has started @entity9 's last three games in midfield due to their current injury crisis 2			1
@entity35 might be consigned to spending most games on the bench but he remains a top - class deputy for @entity40 ’s rising star @entity39			1
@entity35 made six saves against @entity42 to make sure @entity44 ’s side could keep their quest for four trophies rolling forward			1
the 32 - year - old , now certain to stay at @entity48 for the rest of the season following @entity52 ’s move to @entity53 , has let in just five goals in his nine appearances			2
@entity35 showed his value to @entity40 once more as he kept a clean sheet in their 3 - 0 win over @entity42 3			1
@entity61 ’s @entity60 and @entity63 ’s @entity62 seem to be exempt from the rotation policies that affect every other @entity6 footballer			2
while others were rested , both were on @entity4 duty for their clubs against @entity70 and @entity71 respectively			2
they are now the only two outfield players in the top flight to have appeared in every minute of every game in every competition so far this season			2
@entity61 captain @entity60 has played every minute in all competitions of @entity61 's season so far 4			1
one of the jobs on the in tray for @entity80 is to find a way of keeping @entity83 fit			0
the former @entity85 striker proved he could be the sort of powerhouse front man that @entity89 ’s new manager likes when he muscled his way to score the second of @entity89 ’s seven against @entity92			0
the @entity93 international had a hernia operation at the start of the season and has had a series of niggling problems since recovering			0
@entity80 had a record at @entity61 of helping players who had struggled with long - term injuries to overcome their problems and 26 - year - old @entity83 will be hoping he can work his magic again			2
@entity83 ( left ) scored @entity89 's second in their @entity4 third - round win against @entity92 5			1
@entity107 is the latest @entity108 player to benefit from the club ’s policy of showing patience with young players			0
the 19 - year - old finally got to make his debut in the @entity4 win at @entity115 some 12 months since his £ 200,000 transfer from @entity117			1
boss @entity118 believes the former @entity121 youth international midfielder has benefited from time learning his side ’s passing style of football and could break into the @entity6 team before the season is over			0
teenager @entity107 ( left ) made his debut for @entity108 in their @entity4 tie at @entity115 on saturday 6			1
@entity130 goalkeeper @entity129 can sleep easy after his understudy @entity132 ’s hapless display in the embarrassing 3 - 0 defeat at home to @entity136 @entity135			1
highly rated former @entity137 under 21 star @entity132 had been bought from @entity138 for a fee believed to be around £ 2million because @entity140 wanted to put pressure on his 34 - year - old no 1			0
but @entity132 ’s two games so far have been a disappointment – he also let in three when he made his @entity6 debut at home to @entity147			0
@entity130 goalkeeper @entity132 conceded three as they lost to @entity135 in the @entity4 7			2
@entity149 might have the answer to finding more goals for @entity152 already under his nose in the shape of former part - timer @entity155			1
the 25 - year - old , who was signed by @entity157 from @entity158 for a £ 4.5m fee two summers ago , has n’t had much in the way of game time under @entity164 ’s management			0
but his goal in the 4 - 0 win at @entity167 was his seventh in a total of 698 minutes on the pitch – working out at a goal every 99 minutes			1
@entity155 ( right ) scored in @entity152 's 4 - 0 @entity4 third - round win at @entity173 on sunday 8			1
championship leaders @entity174 have more depth in their squad than they are being given credit for by many experts who still do n’t believe they will stay the promotion course			0
manager @entity181 made eight changes to his regular team for the trip to @entity185 but still had enough quality to roll over another @entity188 side 5 - 1			2
@entity18 striker @entity189 scored two of the goals and made two more			0
@entity189 ( right ) scored twice as @entity174 thrashed @entity185 5 - 1 in the @entity4 on saturday 9			2
@entity192 appeared to have no future at @entity194 after getting farmed out on loan to @entity135 last month with a view to a permanent move			0
but new boss @entity198 might be tempted to change those plans after recalling the much travelled 28 - year - old striker early and then seeing him score one of the goals in a 2 - 0 win at @entity204			1
@entity198 now plans to give the burly 6ft 1in forward a fresh chance to prove he can be a success at the @entity207			0
there were eyebrows raised at @entity210 last summer when promising young defender @entity211 was released on a free and immediately snapped up by @entity147 on a two - year deal			0
the 21 - year - old , who has been progressing steadily behind the scenes at @entity215 , has now moved to @entity216 on loan and scored one of the goals in a 2 - 1 win at @entity220			0
@entity211 is one of three @entity215 hopefuls who have signed temporary forms for the @entity225 club ’s new boss @entity223			0
midfielder @entity226 , 20 , also scored on his debut and defender @entity228 gave a polished performance too			0
@entity147 youngster @entity211 ( right ) has impressed this season out on loan at @entity216			0

@entity10 has started injury - hit @entity9 's last three matches
@entity40 's @entity35 made six saves in their 3 - 0 @entity4 win over @entity42
@entity60 and @entity237 have played every minute of the season
@entity155 averages a goal every 99 minutes for @entity152 this term
