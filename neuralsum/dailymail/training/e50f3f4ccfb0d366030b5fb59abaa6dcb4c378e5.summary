@entity0 has been the outstanding player of the tournament for me so far , and not for the first time i ’ve being thinking ‘ if only ... ’ about the missed opportunity @entity5 had to sign him when he was young			1
i was at the @entity8 team ’s hotel the other day after they ’d beaten @entity10 3 - 2 , to have a coffee with @entity0 , @entity12 and @entity13 and it was so refreshing to see the enthusiasm — pure delight — flowing through that group			1
@entity0 has scored three goals in two games and @entity12 and @entity13 were waxing lyrical about his stats , not least the fact that he ’s hitting more than 30kph with the ball still under control — then smashing it home after running half the pitch			1
in most cases i can tell you : rubbish			2
footballers are just the same as any fan			0
we grow up daydreaming of one day playing , perhaps scoring , at a @entity32			0
i ’m sure you ’ve imagined it			0
and when it happens ? ‘ it ’s still that dream come true , ’ @entity0 told me the other day			0
believe me , he ’s living the dream			0
he should have been a @entity5 player			1
he would have fitted in			0
he had a brilliant breakthrough season with @entity61 in 2002 - 03 , a campaign in which he turned 19 , and sir @entity64 wanted to sign him			2
back to his best : @entity12 has impressed for @entity31 after struggling for @entity5 dynamic duo : @entity67 ( right ) seems to be getting the best out of @entity12 at the @entity32 @entity8 delight : @entity70 poses with @entity31 stars @entity13 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) @entity5 made a bid of something around £ 5million , and sir @entity64 was always determined he would n’t over-pay for any player			1
when that was rejected , @entity76 paid something like £ 12m			0
the whole @entity8 squad seem extraordinarily positive			1
the difference in @entity12 , who often was n’t happy last season , is amazing			1
they believe in their manager , @entity67			1
if he tells them the sun is black and the grass is blue , they believe it ! @entity90 was telling me how much fun they ’re having too — and it ’s down to their manager			2
i ’ve often felt @entity0 was one who got away from @entity5 , and never more than now			2
to celebrate the @entity32 , i 've added a special @entity97 to my fashion range , incorporating all the flags of the participating nations and and with a share of the proceeds going to charity			0
you can find them via www.5mag.co and you can follow me on @entity106 for a chance to win exclusive prizes @ rioferdy5			0

@entity12 and @entity13 were full of *praise* for winger
@entity12 is *thriving* again after an *unhappy* season with @entity5
@entity8 players have total faith in manager @entity67
