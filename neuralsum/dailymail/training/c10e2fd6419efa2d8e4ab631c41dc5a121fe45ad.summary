confirmation : the human remains found under a car park in @entity3 are expected to be confirmed as belonging to @entity4 a skeleton found underneath a car park in @entity3 is expected to be confirmed as that of @entity4 the remarkable discovery of the remains , entailing a curved spine back and wounded skull , was made last september			1
since then scientists have been conducting a range of tests to establish whether the remains do indeed belong to the @entity15			1
researchers from @entity17 will hold a press conference on monday morning where they will present the findings of their investigation			1
@entity22 , who initially funded the excavation of what is now a @entity26 car park , said she was ' 99 per cent certain ' that the remains are those of @entity4 - one of @entity28 's most controversial kings			1
the scientists will present the results of carbon - dating tests and a dna investigation , pairing the skeleton 's genetic material with that of @entity36			1
mr @entity36 , a @entity38 - based furniture - maker , is a direct descendant of the medieval king 's sister , @entity40			1
reports suggest that the scientists will also confirm the body was not buried within a coffin or shroud			2
@entity4 died during the @entity46 in 1485 , becoming the last @entity28 king to die on the battlefield , and is thought to have been crudely buried by his successor @entity49 the body in the car park has an arrow in its back , matching details of his death in the battle			2
the skeleton 's scoliosis – severe curvature of the spine – ties in with the famous description by @entity62 and others of the monarch as a hunchback			0
however , those working on the project previously said these details were not enough to prove that the skeleton was @entity4			2
miss @entity22 , who is working on a documentary charting the excavation for @entity72 , said that she had a hunch the king 's remains were under the car park			1
previous reports suggested that academics withheld evidence during press conferences to generate publicity for the documentary , much to the annoyance of some involved in the project			0
@entity95 , who is a screenwriter and member of the @entity97 , said a play that she began researching three years ago has been turned into a script for television and film			0
she told the @entity104 the scripts are now ' getting serious interest from @entity107 and in the @entity108 '			0
the new evidence will also include tartar analysis from the skeleton 's teeth			0
once it is confirmed that the body is @entity4 , it is believed the remains will be buried inside @entity117 - more than 500 years after he was killed in battle			1
findings : this image shows the dig in progress			0
scientists have conducted carbon - dating on the remains , as well as dna testing the decision , made by the @entity128 , came after a row between mps as to where @entity4 should be laid to rest			1
some said he should be given a state burial in @entity135 because he was a reigning monarch			0
others said the remains should be buried in @entity138 , @entity139 , the centre of the @entity142 monarch ’s kingdom			0
but in a parliamentary answer , the government settled for @entity117 , a stone ’s throw from the car park			0
@entity148 , @entity149 mp for @entity150 , said at the time : ‘ this is really good news			0
@entity4 has been lying in @entity3 for 500 years – it seems only appropriate that he should be buried in @entity3 '			2

@entity17 scientists expected to confirm remains are @entity4 's
conducted a range of tests including carbon - dating and a dna match with a descendent of the @entity15 's sister
@entity22 who initially funded excavation said she was ' 99 *%* sure '
a documentary will also be screened on @entity72 charting the excavation and *subsequent* testing
