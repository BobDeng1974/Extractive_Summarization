@entity0 is preparing to muscle into the battle against @entity4 independence following his historic success in the @entity8 elections			1
the @entity10 leader wants to open a new front in the campaign against the @entity13 , to the horror of the established better together allies			1
mr @entity0 was yesterday basking in the glory of winning his first seat north of the border in a major humiliation for @entity19 , who had pleaded with @entity4 to make a direct choice between the @entity13 and @entity10			1
in a stinging attack , @entity30 's @entity4 leader @entity32 said : ' @entity4 now has three nationalist meps			1
' after winning more than 140,000 votes in the contest , mr @entity0 is now planning repeat visits @entity4 in the run - up to september ’s referendum as he feels he has a legitimate platform to speak out in favour of the @entity42			1
he told the @entity44 : ' with the election of @entity27 as the first @entity46 [ in @entity4 ] , we have not just put a fox into @entity49 ’s henhouse , we have put a pine marten into the @entity51 one			2
' we are the only truly national political party , and the success of @entity10 in @entity4 in these elections proves that there is a voice for those who believe in an independent @entity4 as part of the @entity25			1
' @entity19 now finally has to deal honestly and openly with the key contradictions in his position – independence in @entity8 is no independence at all			0
' they know it , we know it , and now we can see the @entity4 people know it as well			2
' mr @entity0 added : ' we have proven over the last few days that we are genuinely a @entity25 independence party			1
' most of you have thought for years that every @entity10 voter is a retired half colonel living on the edge of @entity71 plain desperate for the re-introduction for the birch and only cheering up after the first pink gin of the day			2
' well , we have got a few of those that vote for us there is no doubt about it			0
but actually we cross all social divides			0
' in terms of geography that ’s even more fascinating			0
we have made a breakthrough in @entity4 - something which @entity19 will not enjoy very much at all			2
and we will inject a completely new dynamic into the referendum on separation that is coming up on september 18 this year			2
' @entity13 leader @entity19 is confident of winning september 's independence referendum despite polls showing a narrowing , but consistent lead for the ' no ' campaign @entity0 was all smiles during a meeting of the leaders of @entity98 political groups in @entity99 today the @entity10 leader was back in @entity99 today after last week 's @entity8 election triumph in which he topped the polls - pushing @entity30 into second narrowly ahead of the @entity104 the final results of the @entity8 election were announced in @entity4 yesterday lunchtime , with the @entity13 holding on for victory , despite a sharp rise in @entity30 ’ s support			1
with just over one - third of @entity4 voting in the contest - a total of 1.35million adults - the @entity111 won 28.9 per cent ( 389,503 votes ) – down 0.2 points since 2009 – and @entity30 won 25.9 per cent ( 348,219 votes ) , up 5.1 points			2
that handed both parties two seats in the @entity98 , with the @entity104 picking up a seat after winning a better - than - expected 17.2 per cent ( 231,330 votes ) – it ’s best total for around a quarter of a century			1
@entity10 secured an historic and unexpected fourth place , picking up @entity4 ’s sixth and final seat with 140,534 votes and a 10.4 per cent share , despite a shambolic campaign north of the border			1
the @entity130 won 8 per cent and pushing the @entity131 into a humiliating sixth place			0
at the declaration of results in @entity135 , mr @entity27 was rebuffed when he cheekily asked shadow scottish secretary @entity136 if he could join the anti-independence better together campaign			0
organisers have officially banned @entity10 from joining the @entity104 / @entity30 / @entity131 group , amid fears of fringe elements within the party			2
but mr @entity27 said : ' the @entity10 revolution has now come to @entity4			1
he added : ' i ’d like to thank @entity19 for his tremendous help in getting us elected			0
' throughout the election campaign , the @entity13 attempted to persuade @entity4 there was a direct contest between the third candidate on their list , @entity153 , and mr @entity27			0
@entity10 ’s success now makes it much harder for mr @entity19 to argue that @entity4 and @entity156 are ‘ different countries ’ as he bids to boost support ahead of the independence referendum in september			1
in desperation , the first minister has resorted to blaming the media			0
with 1.35million votes cast , the @entity13 won the backing of 389,503 @entity4 in thursday ’s contest , with @entity30 but as yesterday ’s results were announced , @entity30 ’s lead candidate @entity166 said : ' i ’d like to suggest to @entity27 that the first thing he does when he sits down and recovers from the champagne is write a letter to @entity19 because there is no doubt in my mind that @entity19 ’s decision to polarise the campaign , the @entity4 debate , between two extremes is why @entity27 is with us today as a member of the @entity98			1
' that was met with mutterings of ‘ poor show ’ by deputy @entity13 leader @entity184			0
she said later : ' @entity10 topped the poll in @entity156 and have scraped the final seat in @entity4			1
the gulf between the performances is absolutely massive			0
' @entity4 's first minister has turned the tables on @entity30 following devolution , becoming the dominant party in @entity51 - despite an electoral system designed to make one - party rule extremely difficult to achieve but @entity30 leader @entity32 said : ' from @entity196 to @entity197 , @entity198 to @entity4 we have seen the rise of nationalism and @entity4 now has three nationalist meps			1
' @entity19 and @entity0 represent the same things , but our country deserves better than the simple analysis that our neighbours are the problem dressed up in saloon bar charm			0
those of us who believe in a just and fair @entity4 need to stand firm in the face of these two			0
' in response , @entity13 mep @entity211 said : ' this is a boomerang attack from @entity32 – the hypocrisy of which helps explains why the @entity13 have just defeated @entity30 in yet another national election in @entity4 , after more than seven years in government			2
' @entity10 did worse in @entity4 than in any other part of @entity25 by far			1
@entity10 topped the poll @entity219 because the @entity49 parties have pandered to their agenda in @entity4			1
the @entity13 took them on – and we won the election			0
' @entity104 mep @entity225 , who takes over from the retired @entity226 , said his party ’s vote is the highest it has been for 25 years			0
' we ’ve bucked the national trend and it is a reminder that we have much to offer the people of @entity4 , ' he said			2
' people are concerned about @entity8 and they want change			0
they want change to make @entity8 work for them , not against them , and i believe we have harnessed that concern and that feeling in a very simple way			0
' green candidate @entity240 said : ' in this election we asked ‘ what kind of @entity4 do you want ? ’ the response has been the biggest - ever vote for the @entity130 , showing growing support for our vision of a @entity4 which prizes economic justice , welcomes new @entity4 from around the world , and stands for peace			0

@entity10 leader claims he now leads the ' only national party ' in @entity25
