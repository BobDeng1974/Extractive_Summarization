what do you give a boy born with a silver spoon in his mouth ? the answer , it seems , includes a possum fur cloak , a speedboat that doubles as a car , and a rather more traditional rocking horse			0
whether @entity11 will have time to enjoy any of these things is another matter , however – because they were just three of nearly 800 official gifts he was showered with last year			1
the impressive haul meant the 18 - month - old received more presents than any other member of the @entity21			1
according to @entity34 , the future king received more than 250 games and toys on his inaugural royal tour to @entity38 and @entity39 last april , and more than 120 items of clothing			1
there were also several dozen pieces of sporting equipment , well over 150 books and enough cds and dvds to keep him amused for a lifetime			0
is that for me ? @entity11 grabs at a cuddly bilby toy given to him during a visit to @entity55 another one ! @entity11 was presented with a wombat toy bigger than him by sir @entity57 in @entity38 well - stocked : in total , @entity11 was given 219 toys by members of the public during the @entity38 toy details of the presents were published yesterday in the official list of gifts given to the @entity67 in 2014			1
the exact value of each item is not listed , so as not to offend the giver , and many are also so unique the price is virtually impossible to calculate			0
the list of almost 2,000 items is not exhaustive , however , because prince @entity76 ’s private office and that of @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 at @entity34 only reveal gifts given on official foreign tours			1
haul : prince @entity80 was given five football shirts and one polo shirt during his visit to @entity86 in june unusual : the 30 - year - old was given a decommissioned automatic rifle during november 's trip to @entity90 @entity76 and @entity91 were the recipients of some of the more expensive presents , including two ceremonial swords from @entity96			1
on the couple ’s official tour to @entity100 in the autumn , the @entity97 was gifted a magnificent pair of gold and emerald earrings by the @entity32 of @entity100 , and a designer snakeskin handbag in @entity106			0
the @entity107 received an eclectic range of goods , from a boot scraper to a seven - inch miniature throne from the popular tv series @entity113 , given to her on a visit to @entity115			2
while his miniature boat and industrial quantities of toys might be the most eye - catching part of @entity11 's haul , they are n't the only ones			1
here are the best of the rest : global giving : the @entity21 has received items from all over the world , some unusual prince @entity78 was given an @entity130 ’s hat on the tour @entity132 and several pairs of cufflinks			2
@entity79 received jewellery including a silver and opal brooch , as well as bags and outfits			2
princess @entity139 and prince @entity140 received some of the more original offerings			2
she received princess @entity143 from an anonymous admirer in @entity146 , while the @entity147 was given an @entity149 cd by schoolchildren			0
a @entity34 palace spokesman said : ‘ the vast majority of the gifts are logged and archived			0
some will be taken into royal residences , some displayed or stored and some , such as flowers or perishable items , are often donated to organisations that could make good use of them			0
’ giving and receiving gifts is considered an important part of the @entity21 ’s work in developing good relations with other countries modest items – including books , clothes and gadgets such as mobile phones and @entity170 – can be used by the @entity67 , displayed in a residence , loaned out to an organisation or stored			1
food or flowers worth less than £ 150 can be used , or given to a local charity , hospital or hospice			0
a high - value item , such as jewellery , is not considered to be personal property			0
royals are , however , permitted to use it during their lifetime			0
a gift fit for a @entity107 ! her majesty is presented with a wooden plaque by @entity188 athletes in @entity189 presents : prince @entity76 was given a considerable number of gifts in @entity193 including a packet of dried beef lavish : president @entity196 of @entity197 gave the @entity107 a 15 - piece set of @entity200 porcelain miniature : during a visit to the @entity113 set in @entity203 , the @entity107 was given a model @entity205 presents from @entity206 : during his most recent trip to the @entity209 state , prince @entity140 was given a model dhow unusual : during a visit to @entity106 in december , @entity212 and @entity213 were given tins of fish			1

his parents got plenty of gifts of their own including a *kangaroo* skin
