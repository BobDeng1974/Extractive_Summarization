but the @entity14 has now warned curious members of the public to neither pick up nor touch the ' very rare ' flower , due to the noxious poison and toxins that it contains			1

the sighting comes after the flower , which goes by the real name agrostemma githago , was thought to have disappeared from the @entity42 due to modern farming methods			1
mr @entity8 said : ' it is highly toxic and should n’t be touched			1
i have never seen one before			0

he said : ' this is indeed a very rare flower and was once extinct in @entity42			2
the seed may have found its way into a wildflower mix and blown from a garden but they do lay dormant for years			2
experts say every part of the plant is filled with a poison that can lead to serious illness and , in extreme cases , death ' it ‘ s more likely the soil has been disturbed and the flower popped up			1
' they are poisonous and harmful - but as long as you wash your hands thoroughly you should be okay			2
but i certainly would n’t recommend eating one			0
' the corn - cockle , a pink or purple flower , originates from other parts of @entity78 and is believed to have been brought into @entity79 by @entity81 farmers			1
at one time , most fields would have been filled with the poisonous flower , but modern agricultural methods and weed - killers all - but wiped it out			1
it was also a very common weed in the 19th century			0
the plant was used for generations in folk medicine and even receives a mention in @entity93 ’s @entity92			2
it can grow up to three feet tall and is covered with fine hairs , which can cause skin irritation if touched			0
