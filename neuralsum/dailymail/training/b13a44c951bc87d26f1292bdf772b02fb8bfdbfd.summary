by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:09 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 03:38 est , 25 july 2013 a vaccine which protects against a potentially deadly form of meningitis should not be offered to children in the @entity7 , immunisation experts have said campaigners have condemned plans to prevent children from having a life - saving new vaccine on the @entity11			1
ministers have been told it would not be ‘ cost - effective ’ to give routine jabs against meningitis @entity16 in @entity7 there are 1,870 cases of meningitis b each year and up to 200 deaths , half among the under fives			1
as many as 400 children are left with serious lifelong complications such as limb amputations , blindness , deafness and brain damage			0
vaccination programmes have been used for pneumococcal meningitis and the @entity32 and @entity33 strains , but there is currently no b vaccine in the @entity7			1
@entity36 targets a large number of the 1,000 strains of the disease and was hailed as a breakthrough when it was licensed this year			1
but an independent panel says it would not be cost - effective – despite having no price for the new vaccine – as the disease is on the decline			1
the decision by the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) means worried parents must buy the vaccine privately			1
campaigners say @entity7 has one of the world ’s highest rates of meningitis b. in trials of 7,500 people , the new vaccine produced antibodies against three - quarters of meningitis b strains , suggesting it would give strong protection			1
@entity61 teams helped test the jab			0
@entity63 , reader in molecular bacteriology and microbiology at @entity66 , said he accepted there were uncertainties about the jab , but if efficacy predictions are correct its use could have saved 60 to 80 lives this year			0
@entity75 chief executive @entity74 said : ‘ in terms of cost – what price can you put on a life ? ‘ [ it ] should be negotiated between the drug company and @entity83 because it needs to be on the @entity11 to save the greatest number of lives			1
’ the @entity47 says @entity36 ’s efficacy ‘ has not been established ’ and it is ‘ highly unlikely ’ to be cost - effective			0
it will take more evidence before finalising its advice in october			1
manufacturer @entity89 said it was not asked about cost by the @entity47			0
@entity92 , of @entity89 , said : ‘ we expected to have tough negotiations – but we did not anticipate a decision saying the vaccine is n’t wanted at all , no matter what price			2
’ in april it was announced every child in @entity100 and @entity101 will have yearly flu jabs , even though the illness is very rarely fatal in children			0
@entity105 ( pictured ) is the most common form of bacterial meningitis in this country and one of the most deadly			2
it poses the toughest challenge for scientists because there are so many strains to target professor @entity115 , director of immunisation at the @entity117 , said : ' this is a very difficult situation where we have a new vaccine against meningitis b but we lack important evidence			1
' we need to know how well it will protect , how long it will protect and if it will stop the bacteria from spreading from person to person			2
' we need to work with the scientific community and the manufacturer to find ways to resolve these uncertainties so that we can come to a clear answer			0
' dr @entity133 , immunisation representative for the @entity135 , said : ' nobody doubts that meningococcal b disease can be catastrophic and that all reasonable means should be taken to prevent it			0
' however , before introducing a new vaccine or drug , it is important to be sure that not only is it safe and effective , but bearing in mind the increasing financial pressures on the @entity11 , it also has to be cost - effective			2
' @entity147 spent on the vaccine is money not spent on something else			2
unfortunately , evidence on these points is either lacking or conflicting			0
' it should be possible to fill some of these gaps in knowledge and then the decision should be reconsidered			0

meningitis b vaccine should not be *rolled* out , say @entity83 advisers
say there is ' *insufficient* ' evidence to support introduction of it
campaigners argue vaccine could protect against *73* *%* of cases of meningitis b strains
