by @entity0 the formidable task of trying to win a third tournament in a row at @entity4 is the sort of problem @entity7 will happily take on			1
it is certainly a great deal preferable to the fool ’s gold scenario he was wrestling with when the @entity12 was last contested at @entity13 in 2006			2
never mind the hottest player in the field at @entity16			2
back then , his game was so stone cold he could not even make the starting line - up			1
instead of the old - world charm of the @entity21 he was living the life of @entity24 with the millionaire set off the coast of the @entity27 in a luxury boat — and rather wishing that he was n’t			1
relaxed : @entity7 says he has nothing to prove ahead of @entity4 at @entity16 @entity31 looking to complete @entity4 hat - trick ‘ that was certainly a strange week , ’ he recalled			1
‘ i was half having a great time , living in the most lavish of environments , but people were asking me who was going to win @entity4			1
there was a major going on , and so i did n’t really want to be in @entity39			1
’ he is exactly where he wants to be this week			2
brimming with confidence before the event that has become his no 1 priority			2
and so after the various failures , from the rugby to the cricket to the tennis to the football to the cycling , the hopes of a @entity47 sporting summer now lie with this quiet 33 - year - old who first came to light at @entity4 in 1998 when he finished joint fourth as a 17 - year - old amateur			1
with that stunning performance at @entity58 in mind @entity56 once said he would not feel his story was complete unless he won the @entity12			1
if truth be told , the millstone of that mental burden he placed upon himself has manifested itself in his poor record since , with not a single top - 10 @entity4 finish as a pro. but he has a more rational take now			1
‘ i did say that , did n’t i ? ’ he chuckled ‘ i do n’t think like that any more			2
a lot of that feeling went away when i won the @entity73 last year			1
i ’ve won my major now , and so it means i ’m not going to @entity4 with any sense of having to prove myself			1
teenage kicks : @entity56 celebrates finishing fourth at @entity58 in 1998 with mother @entity76 and late father @entity77 ‘ i ’m over that part of my life			1
i feel the years of having to live up to what i did at @entity58 , or surpass it or justify it or whatever — that ’s gone			1
it ’s just part of my story			2
’ we met on the eve of the @entity89 last week			0
@entity56 was hosting a clinic for @entity91 , one of his sponsors , and , bogged down with allergies , he was feeling dreadful			1
it just sums up what a player he has become that he could go from that state to turn in such a commanding performance over the following four days to win the event			0
his victory in his previous start in the @entity103 in @entity105 ’s capital had been all about guts and determination			0
at @entity108 he showed all the class of a man now ranked rightly in the world ’s top three golfers			1
‘ i went to @entity113 feeling like it had been a slow start to the year , ’ said @entity56			1
‘ i had played some good golf but nothing had really happened			0
‘ and then , on the first day , i was four over par after nine and obviously not playing well			0
to end up winning was unbelievable			0
it was an out - of - the blue win if ever there was , and what has given me so much confidence are the putts i holed on the 17th and 18th holes			1
‘ i ’d never holed a good putt to win a tournament			0
i ’d always had two putts for it , or a tap - in			2
so now i ’m standing over this 20 - foot putt and @entity131 ( his caddie , @entity132 ) has spelled out that this is one i have to make			2
‘ now i ’m developing the belief that when i need to make some putts i can make them			0
it started at the @entity138 at @entity139 against @entity140 in the singles and now this win			0
now the whole year has been tipped into a more positive light			2
i can relax and freewheel a bit , knowing i ’ve got wins under my belt , i do n’t have to worry about the @entity138 and i ’m grateful for the lift			0
these wins gave me a boost in all sorts of ways			0
’ @entity56 began the @entity89 last week seeing it purely as a tune - up for @entity4			1
‘ as the week went on that all changed , ’ he said			0
‘ i hung around on day one and then played really well in the second round and started to really enjoy myself			0
‘ it ’s a great event in its own right on a great course			0
i ’d never won a tournament in @entity159 , the home of golf , so it was a fabulous week			2
’ great scot : the world no 3 was delighted to win north of the border for the first time he knows what comes next			2
hype and expectation ramped up to the @entity170 degree			0
it ’s an unequivocal blessing to have a home crowd in many sports but in golf , when you have so much time to think between shots , it can be a negative			0
‘ it ’s the best feeling in the world if you ’re playing well but if you ’re off your game a bit you can sense the crowd getting edgy and you have to be careful that does n’t affect you mentally , ’ he said			0
@entity56 took in @entity186 recently and was delighted to bump into @entity187			1
like @entity188 two weeks earlier , he was eager to pick the great man ’s brain			0
‘ i ’m always interested in talking to him about how he prepped for majors , ’ said @entity56			1
‘ how can you not learn from him ? we talked about the patience you need over the first three days and just trying to put yourself in position			0
my favourite stat about @entity187 is not that he won 18 majors but he finished second in 19 more			1
that ’s over nine years of his life that he finished first or second in majors			2
is n’t that incredible ? ’ winning three tournaments in a row is an awful lot to ask when you ’ve never previously won two but again , @entity56 will turn back the clock to 2006 for perspective			1
by @entity211 appointment : @entity56 , sitting next to rugby legend @entity212 , at @entity186 earlier this month ‘ if you ’d panned my life out while i was sitting on that boat in exactly the way it has unfolded i would definitely have taken that , ’ he said			1
‘ dealing with the challenge of trying to win three tournaments in a row is the one all pros want			2
‘ when you ’re not playing majors and you have n’t got your form , that ’s the hard part			0
it feels such a long way back before you ’re playing well again			0
now i can just turn up and be myself			0
i do n’t have to play great all week or play out of my skin			0
i need to do a good job over the first three days , see where i am and give myself a chance			0
if that happens i believe in myself now to go on and win			0
it ’s so much more fun when you reach this stage and a more relaxed way of going into majors			0
’ could he turn out to be the unlikely hero of this @entity47 sporting summer ? would n’t that be a victory for modesty and decorum ? @entity56 offers a lovely , wry response			1
nothing to prove : the @entity244 lifts his first major trophy at last year 's @entity246 ‘ it has been the opposite of last summer so far , has n’t it , when @entity248 ( @entity249 ) did his thing at @entity186 and the @entity251 and all the other successes ? so let ’s hope the law of averages plays its part			1
‘ we ’ve been through all these disappointments , whether it be in rugby , football , cricket or the @entity263			1
‘ let ’s just hope the pendulum has swung in our favour			0
’ @entity7 was speaking at the anniversary of the # 1 @entity268 – the @entity269			1
