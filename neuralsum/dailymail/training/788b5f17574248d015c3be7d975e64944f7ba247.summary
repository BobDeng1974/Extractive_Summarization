' it was all a long time ago ... ' prosecutors , who arrested @entity24 and two other former @entity8 guards in recent weeks , claim he assisted in the execution of prisoners in the camp in occupied @entity29 perhaps the most notorious of all the @entity72 concentration camps , 1.1million @entity70 were killed at @entity8			1
the camp consisted of three main parts : @entity8 ( the base camp ) @entity75 ( the extermination camp ) and @entity78 ( the labour camp )			1

it was enough that he was a cog in the machinery of mass extermination			0
but his son @entity135 , 62 , said : ' my father was n’t deployed in @entity8 but was only involved in the site management			2
i hope that he will be acquitted			0
