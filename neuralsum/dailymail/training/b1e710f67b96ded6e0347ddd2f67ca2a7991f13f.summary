' the app will even send you push notifications reminding you to ' give an affectionate touch ' , ' surprise them ' , ' buy a gift ' or even initiate sex get relationship pointers and give your partner kudos for doing kind things but psychologist @entity79 of @entity80 worries the app might be detrimental , allowing people to sit back , relax and take the effort and thoughtfulness out of acts of love			1
he said : ' much of the benefit of doing considerate things is linked to the fact that those things required thoughtfulness and effort			2
take the thoughtfulness out of the acts and they lose much of their meaning			2
' the @entity97 has been brought into the 21st century with an app that enables couples to study its poses in @entity101			1

it was first translated into @entity154 in 1883 under the guidance of @entity158 explorer @entity156			0
new launch : the @entity124 app , seen here utilising ' sexed ' up holograms notoriety : former @entity164 president @entity163 seen here accepting a copy of the hardback version in 1998 therapy traditionally consists of sitting on a comfortable sofa while pouring your heart out to a counsellor			1
but in this digital age , online therapy is just as beneficial - if not more so - than conventional therapy			0
according to a new study from the @entity177 , therapy sessions carried out online have become increasingly common in recent years			0
death of the therapist 's couch ? a new study found that online therapy is more effective than the traditional face - to - face kind many sites , like @entity185 and @entity186 , have created a network of therapists who use instant messages , emails and even video chats to help their patients			0
to investigate how effective this method was , researchers asked six therapists to treat 62 patients suffering from moderate depression			0
after being randomly divided into two groups , one was treated online - through email or instant messenger - while the other received face - to - face therapy			0
both groups received eight sessions consisting of cognitive therapy techniques			0
speaking about the results , professor @entity206 said : ' in both groups , the depression values fell significantly			0
' online treatment : researchers put its success down , in part , to the paper trail it generates			0
fifty - three per cent of those treated online were no longer diagnosed with depression , compared to 50 per cent of those who had face - to - face therapy			0
during follow - up sessions , it was found that rates of recovery among those treated online were higher than the patients who saw counsellors in person			0
at the end of the study , 57 per cent of patients who underwent online treatment were free of depression , compared to 42 per cent of those who had traditional therapy			0
researchers put the online success down , in part , to the paper trail it generated			0
patients were able to re-read the correspondence with their therapist , keeping it fresh in their mind , whereas those who had real - life therapy quickly forgot advice given			0
@entity206 added : ' in the medium term , online psychotherapy yields even better results			0
' our study is evidence that psychotherapeutic services on the internet are an effective supplement to therapeutic care			0
