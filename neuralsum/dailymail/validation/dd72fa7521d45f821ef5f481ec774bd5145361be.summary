nine wild beavers are to continue to live free on a @entity2 river after they passed health checks			1
the animals - the first wild beavers to breed in @entity7 for 800 years - were captured earlier this week and given crucial blood tests			1
their clear results mean the beavers should be released back into the wild on the @entity13 by the end of the month			1
a family of beavers is to continue living free on a @entity2 river after passing health checks that included blood tests			1
@entity7 , the government agency in charge of wildlife , said the animals wo n't be put in a zoo , but will instead be allowed to stay in the wild and be carefully monitored in the first project of its kind ministers wanted the remarkable animals to be rounded up and put in a zoo after they were spotted last year			1
but @entity7 , the government agency in charge of wildlife , decided they will instead be allowed to stay in the wild in the first project of its kind			1
their approval last month was conditional on the beavers being assessed as free of the disease @entity33 , which can be harmful to humans			1
now that tests have revealed that the four adult beavers are free of the disease , and if they pass a few more tests , they are set to be released onto the river			2
the @entity33 parasite is a small tapeworm			1
its eggs can cause alveolar echinococcosis ( @entity45 ) - a disease in humans brought on if a person swallows the tapeworm 's eggs			0
high risk people include hunters , vets and other people who come into contact with carriers			0
this includes wild foxes , or coyotes , household dogs and cats or other animals that eat wild rodents infected with @entity45			2
beavers may also pick up the eggs from their surroundings			0
humans can be exposed to these eggs by ' hand - to - mouth ' transfer or contamination			0
@entity72 , which will monitor the beavers for the next five years , said they had passed a ‘ vital hurdle ’ in one of the most important schemes in the history of @entity78 conservation			1
beavers , which are native to @entity7 , were common in our countryside until they were wiped out by hunters in the @entity84			1
they vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until , mysteriously , one was spotted near @entity88 in eastern @entity2 last winter			2
it later became clear there were nine of the animals , two pairs of breeding adults and five juveniles , and they had been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years			1
it was unclear where they came from – but they had thrived without any outside interference			0
environmentalists were delighted at the unexpected finding , but were horrified when @entity104 , the government ’s environment department , decided last year that they would round up the beavers			2
officials said the animals posed a risk to other wildlife and might spread parasites and disease , and insisted they must be put in a zoo or even culled			2
that decision was reversed six weeks ago when @entity7 granted @entity72 a licence to monitor the beavers as part of groundbreaking conservation programme			1
there are at least nine beavers thriving along a 12 mile ( 19km ) stretch of the @entity13 near @entity122 ( shown on a map )			1
they have been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years , completely unnoticed until just over a year ago the reason for the beavers ’ presence in @entity2 ( pictured ) remains a mystery			1
there is a slim chance they travelled from @entity134 , where they have been successfully reintroduced on several rivers , or even from @entity138 , where there are a greater number of reintroduction programmes the animals will be allowed to live naturally on the river , while wildlife experts monitor the impact they have on the environment			0
@entity146 , communications officer at the @entity72 , said yesterday : ‘ the beavers are at a private site in @entity2			1
they will be there until we get the rest of the results and then we can released them back on to the river , hopefully within a few weeks			0
’ @entity154 of the @entity72 said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers , reducing numbers of trees on the banks , improving light levels , and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams			0
some people think they may slow down flood waters , as well as boosting wildlife diversity			0
farmers and anglers have that they can damage the landscape and fish migration routes			0
as well as being a rare victory for native @entity78 wildlife , conservationists say beavers directly benefit the environment			0
@entity179 campaigner @entity178 said : ‘ this is fantastic news for all the people who fought to save these beavers			0
we always expected them to be disease free , but it ’s wonderful to have it confirmed			0
‘ we now need to get the beavers released back into the wild as soon as possible - and then get on with working to return the species to other suitable parts of the country too			2
’ environment minister @entity192 said : ‘ i am very pleased that all four of the adult beavers have been tested by experts and found to be free of @entity33 , a disease which has the potential to be harmful to humans should it become established in the @entity197			1
’ the reason for the beavers ’ presence in @entity2 remains a mystery			2
there are several captive breeding programmes in the @entity197 , including thirty miles away in western @entity2 , on the other side of @entity205			1
but none of the animals is unaccounted for			0
there is a slim chance they travelled from @entity134 , where they have been successfully reintroduced on several rivers , or even from @entity138 , where there are a greater number of reintroduction programmes			0
they vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until , mysteriously , one was spotted near @entity88 in eastern @entity2 last winter			2
a few months later a second beaver was seen and then grainy pictures emerged in the spring of a juvenile			0
a screen grab of video footage of the beavers is shown @entity154 of the @entity72 said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers , reducing numbers of trees on the banks , improving light levels , and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams			0
an adult beaver with her young is shown			0

beavers have been living and breeding on @entity13 , @entity2 for five years
they are the first wild beavers to breed in @entity7 for 800 years
the family of nine went completely unnoticed until a year ago
ministers called for the rodents to be rounded up and put in a zoo
@entity7 said they could stay wild but only with careful monitoring
and now the creatures have passed health checks including blood tests that screened them for the @entity33 parasite
