@entity2 minor league baseball draws some fans from far , far away , it seems			2
spectators at the @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity2 , were stunned to spot what appeared to be a @entity8 in the sky above the first game of the best - of - three @entity12 final between the @entity13 and @entity14			1
nor was there any doubt as to which team the intergalactic groupies were cheering for - the @entity13 scored four runs at the time of the sighting , sparking whispers of ' cosmic intervention ' and the @entity25 hashtag # @entity26			1
even players on the @entity13 team were tweeting pictures of the flying disc as it hovered above their @entity43 home			1
one @entity25 user said he saw the supposed flying saucer moving up and down in the sky over the crowd of 1,796 baseball fans			1
the luck of the little green men clearly held out , as the @entity13 went on to win the match with a 5 - 1 score , despite a slow start to their play			1
however , a @entity56 video of the surreal sighting produced some less than enthusiastic responses from @entity8 raters			2
is it a bird ... ? fans of the @entity13 and @entity14 pointed in amazement at the sky above the minor league game boldly go : the metallic disc peeps out from behind a tree outside the stadium walls sport star : spectators said the alleged @entity8 hovered up and down as play continued some apparently took genuine offence at the astronomical claims , with one user , who called themselves ' @entity77 ' , writing : ' you guys are so gullible			1
those @entity81 colors are used on the majority of the @entity84 air crafts available in stores			0
even planes , real planes use those colors on each side of the wing			0
' the message continued : ' @entity91 ... i believe in @entity8 's , i truly do			0
but i 'm not a f * * * * * * stupid , gullible , moronic person like the rest of you believing in everything			0
' others mentioned that the camera was pointed towards the southwest , in the direction of @entity102 , and suggested a large passenger jet or freight aircraft might be the more likely identity of the ship			0
yet another @entity56 user , ' thenewaeon ' , floated the idea of ' a weather balloon filled with swamp gas ' , while ' @entity112 stargazer ' wrote : ' i 'm sure there 's a photoshop class near @entity115			0
' # luckyufo : @entity13 scored four runs and won the match 5 - 1 , sparking claims of ' cosmic intervention ' ' @entity120 ' , however , pointed out that as the true identity of the ship was still unconfirmed , the moniker @entity8 - ' @entity121 ' - could still apply			1
this is by no means the only stellar sighting to take place in the country in recent months			0
one survey in may this year suggested record numbers of @entity8 reports in 2012 - a staggering 1,981			2
the figure was almost double 2008 's previous annual record of 1,004 sightings			0
in november 2011 , a @entity8 was reportedly seen over an @entity133 game in @entity134 , @entity135			2

unidentified flying object appears over @entity5 in @entity6
@entity6 @entity13 score four runs against @entity14 while object in the sky
@entity13 win game 5 - 1 leading to claims of ' cosmic intervention '
