a @entity1 toddler who has been on dialysis since she was an infant is about to receive the gift of a new kidney thanks to a complete stranger 1,500 miles away			0
two - year - old @entity6 of @entity7 was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder when she was born , and has since had to spend 10 hours of every day hooked up to a dialysis machine			1
but that may soon change thanks to the generosity of 37 - year - old @entity13 , @entity15 mother @entity14 , who was touched to donate her own kidney after reading a @entity19 post about @entity6			1
what a gift : @entity6 of @entity7 , @entity21 will soon be getting a new kidney thanks to a stranger organ donor who read about the 2 - year - old on @entity19 helping out : 37 - year - old @entity13 , @entity15 mother @entity14 read about little @entity6 's plight and decided to see if she was eligible to donate her own kidney to the toddler @entity6 seemed a healthy baby when she was born two years ago along with her twin sister , @entity29			1
but just seven weeks later , the infant 's kidneys failed taking her family by surprise			1
' when i had her and they said , " her kidneys do n't work , " i was like , " what do you mean ? she 's a baby			0
" she was completely healthy at birth , ' mother @entity41 , 27 , told @entity43			2
since then , the little girl has spent most of her day on dialysis and the effects of the disorder had left her 10 pounds lighter , and 4 inches shorter , than her sister			2
@entity49 became desperate to find her daughter a donor , and while she was n't optimistic about posting on @entity19 - she figured she 'd try her luck anyway			2
' i had no faith that we 'd find a kidney donor on @entity19 but i sure as heck was going to try , ' she told @entity57			2
but the post surprisingly turned out to be fruitful when @entity14 read it on her wall			0
' one of my friends shared one of @entity6 's pictures and it showed up on my timeline , ' @entity14 said			2
' for some reason , i stopped and started thinking about it , and i just knew i had to make a phone call			0
' @entity14 then contacted @entity6 's hospital in @entity71 to see if she was eligible , and after a few tests she figured out she was a perfect match			1
she says she was inspired to donate because she has a 2 - year - old daughter herself , and would hope someone would perform the same act of kindness for her girl			1
young ones : @entity6 was born with a rare genetic disorder that causes scarring of the kidney , and her kidneys failed at just 7 - weeks - old			1
pictured as a baby on the left with her twin sister @entity29 twin sisters : @entity89 and dialysis has caused @entity6 ( right ) to experience stunted growth			0
she is 10 pounds lighter and 4 inches shorter than her twin sister ( pictured left ) try anything : @entity6 's mother @entity41 ( pictured together on the left ) says she was n't optimistic posting on @entity19 would find her daughter a donor , but it proved successful in the end ' @entity14 emailed me to let me know she was the one donating			1
i was in tears reading her email to me , ' @entity49 said			0
' it was pretty crazy			0
all i can do is cry every time i think about it			0
' now the 2 - year - old and her stranger guardian angel are set to undergo surgery on may 7 in @entity71			1
and that 's not the only gift @entity14 is giving the @entity6			2
she has since set up a @entity113 page to raise money to send @entity6 and her family to @entity116 in @entity15 - a favorite vacation spot for the @entity14 family , who have season tickets			1
' it 's so amazing			0
we have n't even met her yet			0
i can not wait for next monday			0
i do n't know if i 'll be able to let go of her once i hug her , ' @entity49 said			0
@entity14 , pictured with her family above , says she was inspired to donate because she has a 2 - year - old daughter herself			1

@entity6 's kidneys failed when she was just 7 - weeks - old
the 2 - year - old has since spent 10 hours of every day on dialysis
mother @entity41 , desperate to *secure* her daughter a *transplant* , posted a plea on @entity19 asking for a donor
@entity13 , @entity15 mom @entity14 saw the post and was inspired to donate because she has a 2 - year - old daughter herself
both @entity6 and @entity14 will undergo surgery on may 7 in @entity71
