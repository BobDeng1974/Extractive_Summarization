by @entity0 a father who was told he was too radioactive to hold his newborn son has overcome cancer to finally cuddle his boy			1
@entity5 , 29 , was diagnosed with cancer just two weeks before the birth of his son , @entity8 , in june			1
the 29 - year - old children ’s book illustrator had thyroid cancer and immediately underwent surgery to have a tumour removed from his throat			1
@entity5 , 29 , ( pictured ) was diagnosed with cancer two weeks before his wife , @entity16 , gave birth to son @entity8 ( pictured )			1
just a month after @entity8 's birth mr @entity5 underwent radioactive drug treatment the surgery went well and he was healthy enough to be present when his wife , @entity16 , gave birth to their son			1
several weeks later however , mr @entity5 began drug therapy which involved taking a daily cocktail of drugs to prevent the cancer - which had already reached his tonsils , thyroid and the lymph nodes - from spreading any further			1
one of the drugs was radioiodine which make a patient 's body become radioactive			2
because of this the new father was suddenly unable to enjoy bonding with his new son			2
mr @entity5 , from @entity40 in @entity41 , said : ' when you take the pills you become radioactive and for three weeks i was n’t allowed near my newborn son			1
' i could n’t pick him up , i could n’t feed him , play with him or change his nappy			0
' it was awful because i was having to watch my wife @entity16 do all these things and i was unable to help			0
mr @entity5 has stopped drug therapy and is now able to cuddle and bring up his son ' while you ’re on the treatment , they have to check you with a @entity57 counter every day to see how radioactive you are and if you ’re safe to be around people			1
' @entity5 , who owns publishers my @entity60 , underwent radioiodine therapy for three weeks			1
the strength of the pills were enough to cause potentially fatal health problems if he got too close to his son			2
mr @entity5 said : ' [ getting cancer ] was a complete bolt from the blue			1
' it ’s like a hammer blow			0
i ’d never in a million years have expected it			0
you think that ’s the sort of thing that happens to other people , not you			0
' i found out i had cancer two weeks before my son was due so it completely knocked me for six			1
' all i was thinking was " am i going to see my son grow up ? " or " am i going to see him born ? " ' i ’d had a lump on my neck for a couple of months before but i had n’t really thought anything about it			2
' then i finally went to the doctor , he said ‘ we ’d better get it checked out ’ and it turned out it was cancer			2
it ’s hard to take in at first			0
' since stopping treatment last month , mr @entity8 has been told is free of the thyroid cancer which spread to his tonsils			1
he is now just waiting for the final results , to confirm that the cancer has not spread to any major organs in his body			2
radioactive iodine treatment is a type of internal radiotherapy			2
the treatment uses a radioactive form of iodine called iodine 131 ( @entity104 )			0
the radioactive iodine circulates throughout the body in the bloodstream			0
radioactive iodine treatment is a type of internal radiotherapy , administered as a capsule or drink thyroid cancer cells pick up the iodine wherever they are in the body			1
the radiation in the iodine then kills the cancer cells			0
radioactive iodine is a targeted treatment			0
it does n't affect other body cells , because only thyroid cells take up the iodine			0
the treatment is usually administered as a drink or capsule			0
patients having radioactive iodine treatment in hospital are looked after in a single room until their radiation levels have fallen again			1
the treatment causes the patient to be slightly radioactive for a few days , so time spent with staff and visitors is minimal			0
sweat and urine also become radioactive , so bedsheets are changed every day and patients have to flush the loo more than once			0
pregnant women and young children will not be allowed to visit			0
even 12 weeks after treatment , patients who have had radioactive iodine therapy may set offradiation alarms at airports .			2

@entity5 , 29 , from @entity41 , was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and underwent surgery on his throat two weeks before his son was born
was *prescribed* radioiodine tablets which made him become radioactive
his radioactivity levels were so high he was not allowed to cuddle or even be in same room as newborn son @entity8 as babies are *vulnerable* to effects
but mr @entity5 has come off the medication and is now able to cuddle baby @entity8 and help bring him up
