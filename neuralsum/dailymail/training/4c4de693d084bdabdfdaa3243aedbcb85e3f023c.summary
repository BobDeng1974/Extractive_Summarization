@entity0 want @entity1 to replace @entity2			1
fine player though @entity1 is , it is hard to imagine he will come near			0
had @entity7 not found a midfield player to score more than 20 goals a season to match him , @entity0 might have won the @entity10 seven years on the turn			2
that this player was @entity12 , currently regarded as the best footballer in the world , confirms the nature of @entity2 ’s talent			2
big boots to fill : @entity0 will find it difficult to replace @entity2 's goals from midfield next season clinical : @entity2 averaged one goal every games three games during his 13 - year career at @entity26 on the ball : @entity28 international @entity1 ( left ) is a @entity0 target to replace @entity2 in their midfield in 2004 - 05 , @entity2 scored 15 goals from midfield and @entity0 won the title			1
the following season he scored 19 times and @entity0 retained it			0
and that is how it would have continued had @entity12 not begun to outscore him			0
in 2006 - 07 , @entity2 got 21 to @entity12 ’s 23 — so @entity7 won the @entity10			1
the following year , @entity12 was simply unstoppable with 42 to @entity2 ’s 20 — another title for @entity7			1
in @entity12 ’s final season , he scored 26 , @entity2 20 and he left @entity7 as champions			1
with @entity12 at @entity43 , @entity2 ’s 27 goals in 2009 - 10 helped return the title to @entity26			1
@entity1 is a beautiful footballer but as a goalscorer he is not in @entity2 ’s class			2
hit and miss : during his spell at @entity48 , @entity1 only managed a goal every five games in 303 appearances @entity52 's best : @entity2 goalscoring feats can only be matched by @entity12 's at @entity7 he scored three goals in 2004 - 05 , five the next season , four the season after that			1
his goals total for @entity48 was 57 across all competitions in 303 appearances , an average of one every 5.3 games			0
@entity2 bows out with one in three for @entity0 , @entity12 with one every 2.4 for @entity7			1
unlike @entity2 in his twilight years , however , he was always used in a forward role			0
special : @entity0 boss @entity64 ( right ) hailed @entity2 ( left ) as ' the best for 10 years ' @entity64 ’s tribute to @entity2 summed up his worth			2
he scorned matters of opinion and stuck only to the facts			0
‘ go to the number of matches he played , the number of goals he scored , the number of assists , the number of ball recoveries , the areas on the pitch he was playing , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity2 was the best for 10 years			0
’ that is some act to follow .			0

@entity2 will be near - on *impossible* to replace at @entity0
@entity2 averaged one goal every three games during his 13 - year spell at @entity26
@entity92 midfielder @entity1 is a @entity0 target
@entity1 averaged one goal every five games during his time at @entity48
@entity2 changed @entity6 football
only @entity12 's goalscoring feats at @entity7 stopped @entity2 and @entity0 winning more *trophies* *domestically*
