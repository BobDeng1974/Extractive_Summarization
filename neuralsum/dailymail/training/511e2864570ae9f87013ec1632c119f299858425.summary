sure , it 's been a positive few days with @entity1 effectively securing their place at the 2016 @entity3 thanks to that exciting win in @entity6			0
but really the international breaks serve only to highlight how brilliant the @entity8 is and how much we miss it when it is n't there			2
here 's 10 reasons why @entity12 ca n't wait for top flight club football to return this weekend			1
saturday summit meeting there will be no easing back into the @entity8 action on saturday as @entity19 and @entity20 meet in an early clash of the title contenders			1
these are the kind of mouth - watering , high - stakes encounters that a @entity28 qualifying campaign simply ca n't offer			0
@entity29 will likely hand £ 16m signing @entity30 his @entity32 debut , no doubt encouraged by the two goals he scored for @entity1 out in @entity35 on monday			1
@entity20 also have a point to prove after their surprise home defeat to @entity38 last time out and will have all guns blazing at the @entity41			2
you can like our @entity43 here ready , @entity30 ? @entity30 is set to be handed his @entity19 debut following his £ 16million move to the @entity41 a tasty clash : @entity19 boss @entity29 ( left ) and @entity20 manager @entity49 meet 2			1
first glimpse of the @entity52 the international pause came at the wrong moment for @entity56 fans , who are drooling at the prospect of seeing expensive new boys @entity58 and @entity60 on the pitch			1
they 'll get their chance at @entity64 on sunday and @entity65 must be fearing a drubbing despite @entity56 's lacklustre start to the campaign			1
in addition to £ 6m loanee @entity60 , we could see debuts for @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 on sunday as @entity76 tries to inject life into @entity56 's campaign			1
and trying to contain them all in the @entity65 defence will be @entity81 , who is sure to get a nice reception on his @entity64 return			1
you can like our @entity56 facebook page here it 's time : @entity58 ( left ) and @entity60 ( right ) playing together has @entity56 drooling rather you than me , @entity89 ... @entity81 will be asked to try and contain the duo on his @entity64 return 3			1
clash of the in - form sides everyone expected @entity95 to make a bright start to the season but few could have predicted their home match with @entity99 would be a top - of - the - table affair			2
the @entity102 side have started impressively , with the wins over @entity56 , @entity104 and @entity105 constituting their best winning run in the @entity8			2
@entity95 were at their free - scoring best in the 6 - 3 win at @entity109 and @entity110 has adapted to life in @entity1 effortlessly			1
he is an injury doubt for the @entity99 match , however , so we could see a @entity95 debut for deadline day signing @entity116			1
predator : @entity110 may be in the line to start up front for @entity95 but the striker remains an injury doubt be prepared : we could see a @entity95 debut for deadline day signing @entity116 if @entity110 is on the sidelines 4			1
@entity128 's @entity127 bow @entity130 fans have already taken @entity128 to their hearts and he 'll make his home debut against @entity133 on saturday evening			1
the madcap @entity134 has pledged to score a load of goals to carry @entity130 to a long - overdue @entity8 title and the team showed their capabilities in a 3 - 0 win at @entity141 last time			1
@entity142 , who at £ 25m was @entity130 's most expensive summer acquisition , may also make his debut after recovering from a knee injury suffered in pre-season			1
but @entity133 , who have started the season unbeaten , will certainly not be cowed as they aim to push on			2
together : @entity142 ( left ) and @entity128 ( right ) could play against @entity133 on saturday evening one of the gang : @entity130 fans have already taken @entity128 to their hearts and his @entity127 debut beckons 5			1
spurs with a point to prove they started the @entity49 era in superb style , winning @entity157 derbies against @entity158 and @entity65			2
but @entity141 were left questioning their top four credentials after @entity130 smashed them 3 - 0			2
having stewed over that result for a fortnight , they finally have the chance to make amends up at @entity164 on saturday , who are still searching for their first win			0
bounce back : @entity167 ( front ) wins 3 - 0 while @entity141 's @entity169 ( behind ) looks glum thinking time : having stewed over that 3 - 0 loss for a fortnight , @entity141 can make amends at @entity164 saturday @entity19 vs @entity20 ( 12.45pm ) @entity95 vs @entity99 ( 3pm ) @entity174 vs @entity104 ( 3pm ) @entity175 vs @entity176 ( 3pm ) @entity38 vs @entity177 ( 3pm ) @entity164 vs @entity141 ( 3pm ) @entity105 vs @entity109 ( 3pm ) @entity130 vs @entity133 ( 5.30pm ) sunday @entity56 vs @entity65 ( 4pm ) monday @entity178 vs @entity158 ( 8pm ) 6			1
a legend at @entity177 newly - promoted @entity177 certainly raised a few eyebrows with their pursuit of @entity183 legend @entity182 over the summer			0
and the former @entity185 and @entity186 midfielder may make his debut in saturday 's match away to @entity38			1
@entity177 were a match for @entity19 in their last fixture , while @entity38 were shock winners away to @entity20 , so both enter in a good frame of mind			1
surprising : @entity183 legend @entity182 may make his debut in saturday 's match away to @entity38 fighters : @entity177 proved a good match for @entity19 in their last fixture and will hope for more of the same 7			1
basement battle it 's a little too soon to be talking about six - pointers , but saturday 's meeting of the bottom two - @entity174 and @entity104 - has that ' must - win ' feel for both			0
@entity174 twice surrendered the lead against @entity176 before @entity204 earned a point in @entity207 's first game in charge and the new boss will return to the @entity211 touchline on saturday			2
@entity104 , who gained their first point against @entity56 last time out , were busy on deadline day and we could see debuts for £ 3m striker @entity218 as well as young loanees @entity219 and @entity221			0
he 's back ! @entity204 earned a point in @entity207 's first game in charge against @entity176 held : @entity104 picked up their first point against @entity56 last time out as @entity225 stumbled @entity226 wo n't win the title - @entity227 8			0
life goes on for @entity175 many feared for them after the summer exodus of their best players but @entity175 have started encouragingly and will be looking for more gains when they host @entity176 on saturday			0
the @entity175 picked up their first @entity8 win of the @entity237 era when they beat @entity158 3 - 1 , with new boy @entity238 opening his account			0
@entity176 , who are still waiting for their first three points , are hopeful ' ginger @entity243 ' @entity242 will be back from the injury that denied him a senior @entity1 debut			2
they certainly will be aiming to do better than the 4 - 0 drubbing they were dealt in this fixture back in march			0
in : @entity175 picked up their first win under @entity237 against @entity158 3 - 1 @entity238 scoring fit ? @entity176 await their first three points and hope ' ginger @entity243 ' @entity242 will be back from the injury 9			0
toffees hoping to kick - start season watching @entity109 has certainly not been dull so far this season , with 17 goals scored in their three matches so far			0
unfortunately , the majority have gone against them			0
but with @entity260 in brilliant form and @entity262 opening his account against former club @entity95 last time out , there have been some positives for @entity266			0
they will chase a first league win at @entity105 on saturday , who have an identical record so far			0
@entity271 is optimistic that some of his new signings will feature at @entity274 , including striker @entity275			0
revenge : @entity262 's header caused @entity95 problems at @entity279 and it opened his account deal : @entity109 boss @entity266 is chasing his first win and hopes @entity262 will help against @entity105 10			2
@entity284 ' new boys set to roar @entity285 proclaimed @entity178 's deadline day business as ' fantastic ' and now fans will get the chance to see the new boys in action - albeit having waited until monday night			0
the @entity284 took @entity176 's @entity292 on loan and smashed their club record to sign £ 10m @entity295			0
@entity296 , another newcomer , will see plenty of familiar faces when they welcome @entity158 , while @entity300 man @entity299 could also feature			0
@entity158 will likely include @entity302 loanee @entity301 in their line - up , likewise new signing from @entity306 @entity305			0
glad to escape : @entity292 could get his chance to pull on the @entity178 shirt against @entity158 at home return to @entity1 : @entity158 will likely include @entity302 loanee @entity301 in their line - up on monday night			0

@entity30 set for @entity19 debut against @entity20 on saturday
@entity58 and @entity60 could be *unleashed* on @entity65 in @entity8 's only match on sunday on @entity81 's @entity64 return
@entity110 an injury doubt for @entity95 but @entity116 could fill the gap
@entity128 set for @entity127 debut with @entity142 *potentially* returning for @entity130 from a knee injury against @entity133 on saturday
the @entity8 returns after the international break , and @entity12 examine why we *'re* all so glad the packed weekends are finally back ...
