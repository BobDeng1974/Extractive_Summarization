by @entity0 @entity1 claimed his first @entity2 win outside of the major championships with a final - round 64 at the @entity4			1
the @entity5 , who won the @entity6 and 2009 masters , finished 16 under par at @entity9 to hold off the emotional charge of @entity11 , whose 61 included a hole in one at the eighth			1
@entity11 ’s consolation is a qualifying place for the @entity16 - though it remains to be seen if he will make the trip to @entity18 , having already pulled out of next week ’s @entity19 due to a family illness			2
champion : @entity5 @entity1 won the @entity4 in @entity9 success : it was the @entity5 's first career @entity2 win outside of the majors pedigree : @entity1 has won two major championships , the 2009 masters and the @entity6 his ace was one of two on the day , emulated by @entity30 at the 18th			1
@entity1 produced the next best thing by holing his 175 - yard approach for an eagle two at the 14th and - despite a pair of bogeys after that - he held his nerve to complete a two - stroke victory			1
he told @entity39 4 afterwards : ' i needed this , i ’ve been working really hard and i ’m really happy i won			0
' i hit it very solidly , i was under control and the work we ’ve been doing paid off			0
' @entity11 is joined by @entity46 , @entity47 and overnight leader @entity48 in qualifying for the @entity6 , with four places available to the top finishers not already exempt			1
the latter trio actually shared fourth place on nine under par with @entity30 and @entity54 , but got the nod due to their superior world rankings			2
a post on the official @entity60 feed shortly after the end of the round read : " congratulations to @entity11 , @ @entity64 , @ @entity65 , and @entity66 on qualifying for £ @entity67			2
see you at @ @entity69 ! " ace : @entity11 was one of two golfers on the final day to shoot hole in ones a long putt for birdie at the third set the wheels in motion for @entity1 , who picked up further shots with pin - high approaches at the fifth and seventh seeing him out in 31			1
he knocked in a good 20 - foot putt at the 11th , calmly holed out for birdie at the next and punched the air as his perfect iron into the next checked left and rolled into the hole			0
with a three - shot lead , it seemed the tournament was wrapped up - but he misjudged his chips at the next two holes and was unable to save par on either occasion			0
@entity92 at 16 and birdie at the long 17th steadied the ship and victory was completed with a tap - in after an excellent first putt along the side of the huge ridge running across the final green			0
@entity11 produced a spectacular front nine of 28 , with his 219 - yard hole in one following four straight birdies for a run of three - three - three - three - one from the fourth			2
three more birdies followed on the back nine as @entity11 kept himself together amid emotional turmoil , with his older sister @entity108 seriously ill. @entity109 - bound : @entity46 was one of the players who qualified for the @entity16 at @entity111 ' sometimes golf does n't mean a whole lot , " he said in a tearful post-round interview			0
' i played good today , it was a good middle part of the round but like i said , golf does n't mean all that much			0
' his 61 equalled the best round of the week , matching @entity124 's effort on day @entity125 , the 2012 @entity6 champion , finished third on his own at 10 under par after a bogey - free , seven - under - par 63			1
@entity30 's ace meant he picked up four shots in the last four holes for a 64 , but as others came in at nine under he was edged out of the @entity6			1
one - under - par 69s were enough for @entity46 and @entity132 , while @entity48 clung on despite finishing with a disappointing 73			0
the former @entity134 lieutenant had led after 36 and 54 holes .			0

@entity1 *clinched* victory with a final round 64 at @entity9
@entity5 's first @entity2 win outside of major championships
@entity1 won the @entity6 and the 2009 @entity144 masters at @entity145
