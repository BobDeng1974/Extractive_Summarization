questions have been raised over the authenticity of the ice axe used by @entity5 explorer @entity3 which sold for a whopping £ 132,000 at auction earlier this year			1
the axe , which is made from iron and wood and stands nearly 3ft tall , was bought by @entity12 investor and climbing enthusiast @entity13 in april after being auctioned by @entity15 , in @entity16 , with an estimated sale price of just £ 8,000			1
however , the authenticity of the axe has now been doubted by some experts who believe it may not have been used on the mountain by mr @entity3 after all			1
questions have been raised over the authenticity of an ice axe , claimed to have been used in 1922 by @entity5 explorer @entity3 ( pictured ) , after it sold for a whopping £ 132,100 at an auction in @entity16 the axe , which is made from iron and wood and measures nearly 3ft tall , was bought by @entity12 investor and climbing enthusiast @entity13 in april after being auctioned by @entity15 with a guide price of £ 8,000 the axe was described during its sale as ' @entity3 's @entity35 from @entity36 ' , and was advertised as the one he used when rescuing three fellow mountaineers from plummeting to their death			1
listing the item , @entity15 's paperwork said : ' during the expedition , @entity42 with @entity43 and @entity44 , set the first altitude record on @entity5 , when on 21 may 1922 they reached a height of 26,800ft			1
' descending from their high point , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 returned to @entity51 , where they met up with the badly frostbitten major @entity53 and all four set off to @entity55 at the north col. during this stage of the descent all four were tied into a single rope			2
' while traversing a steep snow slope at the head of a couloir , the badly weakened @entity53 slipped and pulled @entity43 and @entity44 out of their steps			0
' with three men heading uncontrollably towards the glacier 3000ft below and a seemingly inevitable death , the fate of the whole party now depended on @entity42			2
he was in the lead and the only one still standing			0
all depended upon him being able to apply an effective emergency ice - axe belay			0
' @entity42 was able to plunge his ice axe head deep into the snow , quickly wrap the rope around it and then hold the weight of three sliding and rapidly accelerating men			1
' the incident came two years before he went missing on the mountain , aged 37 , in his last attempt to reach the summit			0
the axe was described during its sale as ' @entity3 's @entity35 from @entity36 ' , and was advertised as the one he used when rescuing three fellow mountaineers			0
pictured : mr @entity3 climbing in @entity91 in 1909 @entity42 and @entity92 were last seen on the north east ridge of the world 's highest mountain heading for the summit on june 8th 1924 , nearly 30 years before the mountain was conquered by sir @entity98			1
following his disappearance , it is understood mr @entity3 's widow @entity101 donated a number of his items to the @entity104 – including the ice axe			0
it is then believed to have been passed onto club member @entity107 , who later handed it to her neighbour @entity109 in the 1980s			0
sadly , he was killed in a car crash in 1985 , while still a young man , and his family decided to hand the collector 's item to the @entity115 in @entity116 , in the @entity117			0
it had been on display in @entity116 for ten years , before being auctioned by @entity15 earlier this year – selling for a staggering inflation of its estimated £ 8,000 worth			0
however , it has now emerged that experts believe the axe might not have been the one used by @entity42 during his @entity5 missions			1
@entity127 , honorary librarian for the @entity128 and an expert witness for the @entity130 , said he has studied the photographs from @entity42 's time on @entity5 and does n't believe the recently - sold ice axe is the one used by the mountaineer			1
' it 's possible @entity42 had two axes on the mountain , ' he told @entity138 , ' but it seems unlikely			2
my best guess is that the ice axe sold in april was n't there			1
' ' i do n't think there 's any doubt the axe came from the @entity42 home			1
but was it @entity3 's ? three weeks to do a proper study is n't enough			0
' the name on the ice axe , according to @entity15 , is @entity155 / @entity154 , which the auction house described as being ' @entity158 '			2
however , it has emerged that it could also have been named after @entity160 – an @entity162 climber – who used his name to manufacture and market climbing equipment			0
if so , @entity162 archives suggest that the first ice axe made by @entity160 was in 1927 - three years after @entity42 's death			1
in a statement , @entity15 's said it had never advertised with certainty that the item belonged to @entity42 originally			2
@entity42 ( left ) and @entity92 ( right ) were last seen on the north east ridge of the world 's highest mountain heading for the summit on june 8th 1924 , nearly 30 years before the mountain was conquered a spokesman said : ' @entity178 was sold by @entity15 as " an ice - axe " , on 10 april 2014			1
' @entity183 to have been used by @entity3 and previously exhibited as such , @entity15 's catalogue description , estimate and saleroom notice reflected that we could not state with certainty that this lot belonged to or was used by @entity42			2
' the heightened analysis of the item came after the sale had to be referred to the @entity130 for an export licence after being purchased by mr @entity13 - a sale lamented by many			2
@entity193 , who climbed everest 11 times , had previously told how he hoped the axe would remain in the @entity196			0
' this axe is a symbol of our national spirit , grit , determination and a will to succeed against the odds , ' he said			0
however , following a three - week consultation process , the item was last week given the go - ahead to be moved abroad .			0
