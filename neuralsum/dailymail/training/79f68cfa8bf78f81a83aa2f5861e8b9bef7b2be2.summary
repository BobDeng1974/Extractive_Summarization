by @entity0 published : 10:07 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 12:33 est , 1 august 2013 death : @entity2 died at a party where she found drugs in flat belonging to @entity5 and @entity6 , who were 70 miles away a coroner today blamed a lecturer and his partner for the death of a 15 - year - old schoolgirl who took an ecstasy overdose at an unsupervised party at their home			1
@entity2 collapsed in a shaking fit and foamed at the mouth after taking two high - purity ecstasy pills and powder she had found stashed in a bedroom closet			1
the teenager , already in trouble for cannabis use , begged friends not to call 999 , and when paramedics were finally summoned it was too late to save her			0
coroner @entity26 said lecturer @entity5 and his partner @entity6 were guilty of serious failures for leaving @entity29 and her friends alone at their house , in @entity32 , west @entity33 , while they went to another party , 70 miles away in @entity36			1
she issued a damning narrative verdict after hearing @entity5 , 62 , a self - confessed ‘ old hippy ’ , had kept ecstasy , @entity40 , ketamine , and @entity42 unsecured in the house for years			1
despite teenagers getting drunk and smoking cannabis at previous parties at his home , @entity5 claimed he never considered someone may hunt out his drugs stash			1
‘ i find if the party had been supervised by @entity6 and @entity5 , as they had done for all previous parties , even if they had just come home around midnight or just after , @entity55 would not have died ’ , said dr @entity26 , at @entity51			1
‘ she would not have taken ecstasy tablets that ultimately took her life			0
’ the couple knew @entity55 and a group of teenage friends would be partying at their home when they left for the night , on april 22 , 2011			1
they only made a last minute phone call to a neighbour , asking her to be ‘ on call ’ for a small gathering at their house			0
but the coroner found serious failures by @entity5 and @entity71 , but rejected a verdict of negligence or unlawful killing because she judged their failure to supervise the party or secure @entity79 ’s drugs had not been ‘ gross ’			1
blame : lecturer @entity5 and his partner @entity6 were 70 miles away and the coroner said today : ' if the party had been supervised @entity55 would not have died ' @entity55 and others discovered @entity5 ’s drugs after rummaging through his bedroom cupboards between 12.30am and 1am			1
the schoolgirl , who had been drinking vodka and @entity88 cider during the party , is thought to have swallowed two high - purity pills from the tin of narcotic			1
around an hour later , her body temperature rocketed to deadly levels as she began sweating profusely , constantly moving around , and talking incessantly			0
death : the @entity32 home of lecturer @entity5 where he kept drugs but insisted they would be ' virtually impossible ' for the teenagers to find one friend , who had also taken ecstasy that night , said : ‘ she was all over the place , people came and told me she was out of it			1
‘ she was crawling and rolling over the bed			0
at one point , i saw her banging at the window of the bedroom			2
’ pals told the inquest @entity55 , who was already receiving drug counselling at school for cannabis use , pleaded with them not to call an ambulance when she first began acting strangely			2
dr @entity119 , a consultant at @entity120 , said @entity55 could have been saved if paramedics had been called immediately			2
‘ the fact we have a description of a person not right for about an hour , there is a window there ’ , she said			0
‘ had that been taken , this life might have been saved			0
’ but it was not until after 4am that someone dialled 999 , and when paramedics arrived , @entity55 ’s face was already stiff and her body temperature had reached 41 degrees @entity135			2
the @entity137 pupil was rushed to hospital but died later that morning			0
@entity5 , who tried to kill himself by jumping off a road bridge in east @entity33 a week after @entity55 died , wiped away a tear as he offered an apology to the teenager ’s parents			1
turning to @entity144 and @entity145 , sitting in the front row of the court , he said in evidence : ‘ i am so sorry about what happened			0
‘ all i can say was at the time i did n’t feel as though it was irresponsible to have left the party unsupervised			0
’ he added : ‘ in retrospect , i very much regret i had drugs at all and i made that decision			0
’ hearing : an inquest at @entity157 in @entity33 heard that the schoolgirl would ' probably ' have survived if she had received medical attention when she first started to feel unwell untimely death : flowers and candles were left in tribute to the schoolgirl near her home after she died from taking up to three ecstasy tablets but @entity5 , a research fellow at the @entity168 ’s @entity167 , continued to insist it was not reckless to leave the party unsupervised			1
‘ at the time , it did n’t seem likely that anybody would come into our bedroom and start systematically looking through the drawers ’ , he said			0
‘ there was a 0.1 per cent chance of anyone finding those drugs , there is also a 0.1 per cent chance that someone might turn the cooker on and some kind of gas malfunction causes a fire and people die			0
’ ms @entity6 told the inquest she believed it was a ‘ manageable risk ’ when they left the party of more than 20 teenagers alone for the night			1
they had asked a neighbour to be ‘ on call ’ during the party , and she claimed to not know exactly where @entity5 kept his drug stash herself			1
but dr @entity26 ruled it was ‘ highly likely ’ ms @entity6 knew about the drugs in the house			2
‘ i find it difficult to believe did n’t know there were drugs in that house , they had been living together and sharing that bedroom for fifteen years ’ , she said			0
‘ i have consider this was an explanation put together after the event to try to avoid culpability failing on ms @entity6 , but i ca n’t come to a firm conclusion on that			2
’ ms @entity144 , @entity55 ’s mother , told the court she would never allowed @entity55 to go to the party , in @entity32 , had she known it was unsupervised			1
‘ we know young people put themselves in risky situations , particularly if there are no adults around and if they know no adults of coming back ’ , she said			0
‘ i think it is pretty obvious so many things could have gone wrong and i ’m not even thinking about drugs , but young people bringing in alcohol , older kids finding out and breaking into the house , and accidents happening			0
‘ i do think we were naive , but we clearly thought at that age , children would not be left unsupervised			0
’ mourning : friends and family release balloons in memory of the schoolgirl whose temperature soared to 41.7c after taking the drugs dr @entity26 said rejected parts of @entity238 and @entity71 ’ evidence , accusing them of ‘ post event justification ’ for their actions and for being inconsistent			0
‘ they appeared to state they wanted to give the impression they might be coming back , but considered against the evidence , i make a finding of fact that there was a general understanding they would be away for the night ’ , she said			0
‘ the evidence of @entity5 and @entity6 i do not accept , i find it was post event justification			1
’ she recorded a narrative verdict which concluded : ‘ leaving the stash unsecured and the party unsupervised were both serious failures ... and led to the death			2
’ in a statement released after the inquest into @entity55 ’s death , her parents said : ‘ they knowingly left a party of 14 and 15 - year - olds all night , with a substantial quantity of class a drugs in an unlocked cupboard			1
' we thought @entity55 was in a safe place , somewhere she had stayed before and we would not have let her go if we had known it was to be unsupervised			2
‘ what is so painful was for us to learn that , if a responsible adult had been there to call an ambulance early enough , @entity55 ’s life could have been saved			2
