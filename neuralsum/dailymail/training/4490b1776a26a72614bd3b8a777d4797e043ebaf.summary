@entity1 mathematicians believe that ' self replicating ' robotic space probes sent by alien civilisations could already be in our solar system			1
the @entity8 study warns that the probes are probably so hi - tech they appear invisible to us as we do n't have technology advanced enough to detect them			1
while our @entity14 probe has just reached the edge of our solar system , older and more technologically advanced civilisations could have launched similar probes years before us that are already here			0
mathematicians believe robotic space probes , perhaps slightly similar to @entity22 's @entity21 ( pictured ) have been sent by alien civilisations and could be in our solar system @entity24 and @entity25 believe that alien races could have sent probes that ' slingshot ' round stars using their gravity to cover ground quickly , @entity28 reported			1
the researchers analysed how a ' fleet ' of probes could travel through space in a paper published in the @entity39			1
they said probes that ' self replicate ' and build new versions of themselves from dust and gas while traveling through space , could be in our solar system already			2
dr @entity24 thinks that as we have not seen any of these probes could mean that we are alone in our galaxy			2
our @entity14 ( pictured ) has just reached the edge of our solar system , but older , more technologically advanced civilisations could have launched similar probes years before us that are already here he said : ' the fact we have n't seen probes of this type makes it difficult to believe that probe building civilisations have existed in the @entity58 in the last few million years			0
' the mathematicians calculated that alien probes would only need to travel at 10 per cent of the speed of light in order to explore every part of our galaxy within 10 million years			1
they think that the probes can use ' slingshot manoeuvres ' around stars to increase their velocity by using energy from the star 's motion around the galactic centre			0
scientists think that alien probes can use ' slingshot manoeuvres ' around stars ( pictured ) to increase their velocity by using energy from the star 's motion around the galactic centre the study re frames the question posed in the ' @entity83 ' about the search for alien life in 1953 physicist @entity86 asked ' where is everybody ? ' the mathematicians ' prove ' that alien probes could technically be close by in our solar system @entity93 of the @entity94 write that alien artifacts could already exist in our solar system but we haven ; t looked hard enough for them @entity22 expert @entity99 thinks that they have been designed to appear invisible to us - so we ca n't prove they are nearby dr @entity24 thinks the probes will make contact when we have passed their intelligence test - perhaps by sensing their presence our @entity14 probe uses a similar technique on planets in the solar system , but utilising the larger gravity of a star would lead to a much bigger speed boost			1
the mathematicians used computing power to inform their predictions , which might not sound out of place in a sci - fi novel			0
their work shows that it is mathematically possible for alien probes to be close by , but does not explain why they have not been in touch			1
the scientists said : ' we can conclude that a fleet of self - replicating probes can indeed explore the @entity125 in a sufficiently short time ... orders of magnitude less than the age of the @entity129			2
' they muse that the alien probes would have been programmed not to all arrive at the same time , or their presence could look like a hostile attack and cause panic on @entity129			2
in a paper from 2011 , @entity93 of the @entity94 wrote that alien artifacts might already exist in our solar system without us knowing , simply because we have n't looked for them hard enough			0
our @entity14 ( pictured ) ' slingshots ' around planets			0
taking account of such techniques to gain a speed boost , the mathematicians ' theory shows it is technically possible for alien probes to be in our solar system the @entity1 mathematicians draw on @entity22 space expert , @entity99 's idea from 1983 that supposes that alien probes have been designed to appear invisible to us			1
dr @entity24 believes a probe 's camouflage could be set up to test the intelligence of our civilisation only when a test is met , such as a species being able to detect a probe , would it attempt to communicate			0
he notes that evidence of broken probes is unlikely as any aliens attempting large - scale exploration of the universe would be skilled engineers			0
he thinks that such civilisations would send probes that can self - replicate over the incredibly long distances traveled .			0

researchers from @entity8 analysed how a ' fleet ' of probes could travel through space
alien probes would only need to travel at one tenth of the speed of light in order to explore every part of our galaxy
@entity1 mathematicians warn that alien probes are so hi - tech we probably ca n't detect them
their theory shows that it is mathematically possible for alien probes to have already arrived
