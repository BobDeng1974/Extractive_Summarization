liver disease treatment and detection facilities must be ' scaled up ' to deal with the increase in those dying , experts claim excessive drinking among the middle classes is fuelling an increase in deaths from liver disease , experts warned yesterday			1
they claim alcohol dependence has become a ‘ lifestyle choice like @entity14 jeans ’ rather than being recognised as a potentially deadly disease			1
figures show deaths among younger people have gone up 500 per cent in 30 years , while other @entity20 countries are seeing their rates tumble			1
and current tests for liver damage may be ‘ falsely reassuring ’ because they can not show the true extent of scarring caused by alcohol , obesity or viral hepatitis			2
the @entity29 said liver disease treatment and detection facilities must be ‘ scaled up ’ to deal with the problem			1
they are calling for @entity32 to have access to simple scanners which would help detect those at risk from a ‘ silent killer ’			1
professor sir @entity37 , a member of the commission and former president of the @entity40 , said : ‘ four out of five case of liver disease are caused by alcohol , while death rates from cirrhosis are tumbling in countries like @entity47			1

‘ alcohol dependence is being treated like a lifestyle choice like @entity14 jeans rather than as a disease			1
we sell it for pocket money prices , ’ he said			0
‘ people say we have always been big drinkers			0
in fact it mirrors price almost exactly			0
‘ if you go back 20 years most drinking was done in pubs and bars			2
eighty per cent of all drinking now is done at home – especially old people behind closed doors			1
’ apart from @entity74 , the @entity49 is the only country in western @entity20 where the prevalence of liver disease has increased			1
death rates for those under 65 have increased from 2.82 per 100,000 in 1970 to 10.85 in 2010 – claiming 11,000 lives a year in @entity80 and @entity81 alone			0

in tests on rats , the drug reduced the number of brain cells killed by alcohol			0
cells saved included those vital to navigation and orientation			0
the drug , known only as ethane - beta - sultam , also seemed to stop the rats from behaving impulsively			0
@entity107 , of the @entity108 , said the drug would be a treatment , not a pill youngsters could take before a night out			0
at present , problem drinkers are given a liver function blood test but the results can be ‘ falsely reassuring ’ because 80 per cent of people with cirrhosis have normal results , professor @entity37 said			2
instead of relying on outdated testing , @entity32 should buy or share cheap £ 30 portable scanners or £ 70 fixed machines that reveal liver scarring			1
dr @entity122 , who runs the liver unit at @entity124 and is co-founder of the @entity126 , said most drinkers will quit when confronted by hard evidence of liver damage			0
‘ three - quarters of liver disease is not being picked up , ’ he said			1
‘ [ @entity32 ] are using outdated technology and tests that do n’t work – they think they work but they do n’t			2
