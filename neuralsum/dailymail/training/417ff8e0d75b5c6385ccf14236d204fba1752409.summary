@entity0 will welcome winger @entity1 back in to their squad for the @entity4 tie with @entity5 at the @entity6			1
@entity1 has not played since damaging his groin in the @entity9 loss at @entity10 on september 17			1
but the @entity12 international is back in contention after making a quicker than expected recovery			2
@entity1 was pictured back in training with @entity0 's squad following his groin injury ' @entity1 is working and is in the squad list , ' said @entity0 boss @entity18			1
' i do n't know if he will play			2
' @entity20 is the only player unavailable to the @entity21 due to a thigh muscle strain			1
the former @entity24 midfielder is also expected to be ruled out of sunday 's @entity26 derby against bitter rivals @entity27			1
@entity1 's return would provide a welcome boost after saturday 's shock 2 - 1 defeat at @entity32 left the @entity34 champions third in the table and six points behind leaders @entity24			1
' we are disappointed , ' admitted @entity18			1
' @entity32 played well but we did n't deserve to lose			2
we did n’t convert the chances			2
' all the other teams will drop points			2
every point you drop makes it harder but last season we were quite a few points behind as well			0
there are many points left and we just want to fight for them			0
' @entity1 looks on as @entity49 helps @entity50 back to his feet in training on tuesday @entity0 's star midfielders @entity50 and @entity53 bump into each other as they watch events elsewhere saturday saw @entity0 's second league defeat in nine games this season			1
despite also struggling to qualify from their @entity9 group , @entity18 insisted that his side had not been worked out by the opposition			1
' we have to analyse the @entity9 after the group , not now			0
the @entity34 last year was exactly the same			0
people criticised us and said we had to change and that we did n’t know how to play away			2
we won four from the first 18 points away last season			0
things change but we know we have to improve			0
' @entity1 was man of the match as @entity0 beat @entity70 at @entity71 to lift the @entity4 in march , and while @entity18 admits the club have other priorities this season he will not neglect to defend the silverware			1
' it ’s important for the club to win trophies , it does n’t matter which one			0
we want to be involved in all four but winning a competition at @entity71 – the most important stadium in the world – in front of 80,000 people who were singing was special			0
captain @entity85 protects the ball under pressure from striker @entity88 at the @entity6 goalkeeper @entity89 shows there 's more to his games than just glovework with a fancy backheel flick ' i tell the players to try to win every game			0
we do n’t have to say which competition is most important			0
of course we would prefer to win the @entity34 but that does n’t mean we do n’t want to win the @entity4 because we do			1
' @entity18 also received a personal boost when he was named on @entity101 's 10 - man shortlist for the @entity103 award			1
@entity24 's @entity104 and @entity27 's @entity105 are among the other managers up for the gong , but will face stiff competition from the likes of @entity112 - winning @entity111 manager @entity110 and @entity114 's @entity113			0
' i heard today , ' said @entity18			2
' normally it is the coaches that win the big leagues that are nominated and those that win the @entity112			0
of course it 's nice but it 's nicer to win the league here			0
