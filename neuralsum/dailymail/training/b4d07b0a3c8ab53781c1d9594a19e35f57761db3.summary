since 1990 , scientists have used complex models to predict how climate change and manmade greenhouse emissions will affect the world			2
but a team of experts - including an astrophysicist , statistician , and geography professor – has claimed these models ‘ very greatly exaggerate ’ the effects of global warming			1
using a simpler , solar - based model , the researchers arrived at figures that are more than half those previously predicted			1
the researchers tested their ‘ simple ’ mathematical model against complex models used by climate scientists , such as those involved in the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) report			1
they also compared predictions against real - world temperature changes			2

mathematical equations used for large climate model typically require supercomputers that perform calculations quickly - some make more than 80 million calculations an hour			1
sophisticated climate models take into account the amounts of animals and plants , or biosphere , the hydrosphere ’s oceans and other bodies of water , sea ice and ice sheets in the cryosphere , and the geosphere , that measures tectonic variations such as volcanic eruptions and moving continents			1
by comparison , the team ’s simple model looked at temperatures caused by so - called anthropogenic radiative forcings and consequent ‘ temperature feedbacks ’ over a given timeframe			1

by comparison , the team ’s simple model looked at temperatures caused by so - called anthropogenic radiative forcings and consequent ‘ temperature feedbacks ’ over a given timeframe			1
anthropogenic radiative forcings , put simply , are measured by the difference between the amount of sunlight absorbed by @entity93 , and the energy that is radiated back to space			2
a temperature feedback is created by albedo - the amount of shortwave radiation from solar energy reflected by @entity93			1
ice and snow is highly reflective , so has a high albedo , for example			0
this means the majority of sunlight that hits snow is sent back towards space			0
when ice and snow melts , as temperatures rise , the darker soil or grass lowers the albedo			0
this increases the ground ’s temperature , causing more snow to melt , leading to a further rise in temperature			0
both of these measurements can be used to suggest global temperatures , radiation and energy levels in the atmosphere and the @entity93			1

the researchers tested their so - called ‘ simple ’ model and its global warming predictions against the complex models used by climate scientists			1
in particular , those complex models involved in the @entity166 and @entity167 ’s ( @entity167 ) @entity22 ( @entity22 ) report			0
they also compared their predictions against real - world temperature changes			2
the paper claims that the measured , real - world rate of global warming over the past 25 years , equivalent to less than 1.4 ° c per century , is ‘ half the @entity22 's central prediction in 1990			1
’ in 1990 , the @entity166 's climate panel predicted with ‘ substantial confidence ’ that the world would warm at twice the rate that has been observed since			2
according to the study , another error made by the complex climate models , include the assumption that ‘ temperature feedbacks ’ would double or triple direct manmade greenhouse warming			1
the simple model instead found that feedbacks could reduce warming			2
also , modellers are said to have failed to cut their estimate of global warming in line with a new , lower feedback estimate from the @entity22			2
predictions of global temperature were extrapolated from january 1990 to october 2014 ( shaded region )			2
this was compared with observed anomalies ( dark blue ) and temperature trends ( bright blue )			0
‘ [ climate scientists ] still predict 3.3 ° c of warming per co2 doubling			1
they should only be predicting 2.2 ° c , ' said the researchers in 1990 , the @entity166 's climate panel predicted with ‘ substantial confidence ’ that the world would warm at twice the rate that has been observed since			1
last year 's report found that , by the end of the century , the emission of greenhouse gases will bring temperatures that are about 3.7 ° c ( 6.7 ° f ) warmer ‘ they still predict 3.3 ° c of warming per co2 doubling , when on this ground alone they should only be predicting 2.2 ° c - about half from direct warming and half from feedbacks , ’ said the researchers			1
the latest @entity22 ( @entity22 ) report was published in november			0
it said continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long - lasting changes			0
this will increase the likelihood of ' severe , pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems			0
' such impacts include extreme weather and rising sea levels , heat waves , flooding and droughts			0
@entity239 , which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans , will harm marine life			0
without changes in emissions , ' climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century			0
' at the current rate , by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another 2 ° @entity249 ) compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005			0
by the end of the century , that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 3.7 ° c ( 6.7 ° f ) warmer			0
the impact on the @entity93 could already be considered dangerous , the report claimed			0
‘ though the complex models say there is 0.6 ° c manmade warming " in the pipeline " even if we stop emitting greenhouse gases , the simple model - confirmed by almost two decades without any significant global warming - shows there is no committed but unrealised manmade warming still to come			1
’ once these errors are corrected , the researchers predict that the most likely global warming in response to a doubling of @entity270 is not 3.3 ° c , but 1 ° c or less			1
and , even if all available fossil fuels were burned , less than 2.2 ° c warming would result , they claim			2
author dr @entity32 , an solar physicist at the @entity274 , said : ‘ our work suggests that man 's influence on climate may have been much overstated			2
‘ the role of the sun has been undervalued			0
our model helps to present a more balanced view			0
’ ‘ a high - school student with a pocket scientific calculator can now use this model and obtain credible estimates of global warming simply and quickly , as well as acquiring a better understanding of how climate sensitivity is determined , ’ added statistician and co-author dr @entity36			1
‘ as a statistician , i know the value of keeping things simple and the dangers in thinking that more complex models are necessarily better			2
‘ once people can understand how climate sensitivity is determined , they will realise how little evidence for alarm there is			0
’ while @entity29 said : ' our irreducibly simple climate model does not replace more complex models , but it does expose major errors and exaggerations in those models			1
‘ for instance , take away the erroneous assumption that strongly net - positive feedback triples the rate of manmade global warming and the imagined climate crisis vanishes			1
’ @entity316 has contacted the @entity22 for comment .			0

researchers claim global warming predictions are ' greatly exaggerated '
large climate models typically require computers to perform calculations
they consider *factors* such as animal numbers and tectonic variations
by comparison , a team of researchers has created a ‘ simple ’ model
it looks at levels of solar energy absorbed and reflected by @entity93
using this simple model , they claim current predictions are wrong
once errors are corrected , global warming in response to a doubling of @entity270 is around 1 ° c or less - a third of the predicted 3.3 ° c
