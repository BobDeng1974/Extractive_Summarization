the @entity0 arrived at @entity2 station this morning by public train - but not before local police had secured the area			1
she was en route to @entity7 , her @entity8 estate , where the royal family traditionally spend the @entity11 period			1
but there was no sign of the @entity14 , with the queen arriving accompanied only by her close protection team			1
the monarch has made a habit of taking the train to @entity7 , albeit in @entity26 , setting off from @entity27 in @entity21 and arriving at @entity2 an hour and a half later			1
her majesty certainly appeared to be looking forward to her break , beaming broadly as she strode down the platform wearing an eau - de - nil tweed coat and one of her trademark floral headscarves			2
members of the wider royal family will begin arriving next week with prince @entity37 and the @entity38 expected on @entity39 , along with prince @entity37			0
the @entity14 and @entity40 , meanwhile , are set to spend their first @entity11 at their @entity8 home @entity42 but will join the rest of the royal family at @entity7 on the day itself			1
@entity7 has been owned by the royal family since 1862 when it was purchased by @entity46 at the request of her son @entity48 , then @entity37			2
alone : the @entity0 travelled with her close protection officers , with prince @entity14 nowhere to be seen commuter : her majesty travelled to @entity2 on a normal commuter service , albeit in @entity26 big arrival : the @entity0 looks up as she arrives after a journey of approximately one and a half hours main line : a security guard waits for the train , which began its journey at @entity59 , to come to a stop since then , the house has been in continuous use by the royal family and it was there that @entity64 died on the 6th february 1952			1
it is also from @entity7 that the @entity0 's annual @entity11 speech is broadcast , usually uncontroversially , although this year looks set to change all that			1
bookies , among them @entity69 and @entity70 , have suspended betting on the @entity0 revealing abdication plans in this year 's speech			1
although @entity20 sources have previously said the @entity0 will never step down , betting was halted following a flurry of surprise wagers			2
' throughout the year there has been major speculation about the @entity0 's future but the gamble has really caught us by surprise , ' said @entity70 's @entity82			2
' as far as we are concerned there 's no smoke without fire when bets like this come through all in succession , so we have decided to be safe rather than sorry and pull the plug on the market			0
' on her way : the @entity0 will now remain at @entity7 until mid february looking forward to @entity11 : the @entity0 appeared to be looking forward to her break and was all smiles a @entity96 spokesperson refused to comment , but did highlight the pledges made by the @entity0 in her 21st birthday speech in 1947			1
the young @entity99 said : ' i declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong			0
' in her june 1953 @entity109 speech , she also said : ' i have in sincerity pledged myself to your service , as so many of you are pledged to mine			0
although it is rare for @entity118 monarchs to step aside , with @entity119 the only monarch to do so , the practice is considerably more common in @entity120 , where no less than four have stood down in the last two years			0
2013 was the busiest year for abdications , with queen @entity122 , @entity123 of @entity124 and pope @entity125 all stepping down			2
rumours : she has been plagued by abdication rumours after bets were suspended on an announcement speech : bets were placed on an announcement being made during her @entity11 speech playing it safe : @entity2 station was searched by police before the @entity0 's train arrived new ruler : @entity140 of @entity141 is the newest @entity120 monarch after his father stepped down in june the following @entity143 , @entity144 of @entity141 , 76 , announced plans to step down on the grounds that ' i do n't want my son to grow old waiting like @entity37 '			1
he formally abdicated on the 18th june , making him the fourth @entity120 monarch to do so in less than a year			0
despite the flurry of abdications , the @entity0 has always stated that she has no plans to do the same , despite being older than all of the four			0
one monarch who may yet do so is @entity156 's @entity155 , 74 , who has been on the @entity156 throne for 42 years and has an heir , @entity158 , of the same age as 46 - year - old @entity140			0
however , despite claims in an @entity164 magazine that an announcement is imminent , sources close to the @entity156 queen have said she has no intention of stepping down and described the reports as ' all lies '			0
stepping up : @entity169 ascended to the throne on the 30th april 2013 monarch : @entity172 of the @entity124 took his throne two months after @entity169 next up ? the @entity156 queen , @entity155 , is rumoured to be stepping down in favour of @entity158 ( right )			0
