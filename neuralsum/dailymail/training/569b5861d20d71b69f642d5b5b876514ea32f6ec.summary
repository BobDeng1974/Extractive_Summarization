a string of other ministers leaving the @entity34 also qualify for pay - offs , totalling almost £ 180,000 following mr @entity11 ’s wide - ranging reshuffle			1
the final total will be well over £ 200,000 when payments to their advisers are included			1

they should do what the rest of the country is doing and tighten their belts			0
in many cases these payments are rewards for failure			0
‘ the honourable thing to do would be not to take a penny			0
then the whole system should be scrapped to prevent a repeat			0
’ mr @entity11 ’s reshuffle led to the biggest clear out of ministers since the election			0
some 15 former ministers , some of them extremely wealthy , are entitled to tax - free payments to cushion the blow of losing office			1

former foreign office minister @entity118 , former international development minister @entity119 and former solicitor general @entity120 are all expected to receive knighthoods			0
