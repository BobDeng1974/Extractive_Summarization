‘ i ’ve got players who are proud to wear the shirt again			0
’ @entity0 has been ruthless , releasing 11 players and transferring nine			2
he then scoured the lower leagues and non-league , bringing in 11 new faces			0
the overhaul does not stop there			0
chairman @entity52 is working on a deal to sell @entity3 ’ @entity54 to @entity55 ’s to fund a new all - seat arena near to the @entity59 ’s @entity58 campus			1

for saturday ’s game @entity3 sold their allocation of 800 tickets and brought 1,255 in total for the 200 - mile round trip			1
until then @entity22 had averaged gates of just 1,984			2
@entity3 fans filled the corner of the @entity23 — now known as the @entity67 — sharing it only with a horse chestnut tree and a few police officers			1
two relegations in four seasons is tough on any team and losing @entity4 status can be catastrophic			2
but @entity3 fans have stood firm			1
‘ if fans were put into league tables , ours would be in the @entity120 , ’ @entity0 said			2
many of those in blue and white preferred refreshment of a different kind at the local @entity125 pub rovers fans have remained loyal to their side despite the bitter disappointment of last season 's relegation @entity131 of @entity22 ( centre ) and @entity133 of @entity3 contest a header press officer @entity135 , at the club for 14 years , said : ‘ we ’ve been amazed by their loyalty , especially after we only won one point from our first three games			1
’ that so many travelled to @entity22 , where tickets for the press are handed out from a car boot , is testament to their love of the club			2
they went home with a hard - earned point , their trip spoiled by a brilliant 25 - yard free kick by @entity22 ’s @entity153 in the 77th minute			1
the home side took an early lead when @entity156 converted a 16th - minute penalty , but @entity3 looked likelier winners when they turned the game around			1
@entity17 of @entity3 ( left ) and @entity153 of @entity22 compete for the ball early on @entity3 fans pose for the camera on the away terrace on one corner of the @entity23 @entity3 fans find their voice at the back of the covered stand that forms one part of the away section @entity17 and @entity24 celebrate after the former drew the scores level at 1 - 1 @entity24 calmly converts his penalty to put @entity3 2 - 1 up after 68 minutes of the match goalkeeper @entity173 salutes the travelling supporters at the final whistle this young supporter seemed pleased that @entity3 took a share of the spoils three minutes before half - time @entity17 looped in an equaliser and @entity24 stroked a penalty into the bottom right corner on 68 minutes			1
when @entity3 ’ @entity133 headed against the crossbar in the second half , 500 pairs of hands went to 500 heads in the standing section			0
@entity22 were reduced to 10 men in added time when @entity153 was sent off for a second yellow card but there was no time to take advantage			2
