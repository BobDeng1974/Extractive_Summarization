@entity17 was prosecuted by the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) after the investigation found there had been an ‘ alarming lack of communication ’ , with many staff unaware of @entity25 ’s ‘ well documented ’ needs			1
her family described the death as ‘ disgraceful and unnecessary ’			1
@entity29 was told that @entity25 , who suffered from dementia and motor neurone disease , was admitted into @entity32 in november 2010			0
the home was made aware that @entity25 had difficulty swallowing , needed pureed food on a teaspoon and supervision by a carer while eating , the @entity18 said			1
two weeks later , she was given fish and chips in a cone along with other residents while she was at a film and supper evening in the care home on december 1			0
when a member of staff began clearing up the meals during the film , she noticed @entity25 slumped in her chair			0
a nurse attempted to resuscitate her but she was later pronounced dead			0
a post mortem found the primary cause of death was choking			2
the @entity18 investigation into the incident found neither of the staff who organised the film and supper evening had been made aware that @entity25 could not eat solid foods			1
a specialist assessment carried out at the local hospital , recommending she be supervised at meals and prompted to slow down and swallow twice during each mouthful , had been provided to the care home but was not communicated to staff , the @entity18 said			2
it added that a care plan and risk assessment had also not been completed by @entity17 for @entity25 on her arrival at the home , which would have identified the need for a care worker to feed her pureed food during meal times			1
it also emerged that a carer at the home had left @entity25 alone to eat un-pureed @entity80 a few days before the film and supper evening			0
@entity17 ( @entity84 @entity83 , part of the @entity17 group which runs more than 500 care homes and specialist care centres in the @entity89 , pleaded guilty to a single breach of the @entity18 at @entity91 , the @entity18 said			1

speaking after the hearing , @entity18 inspector @entity98 said : ‘ this was a tragic death which could have been avoided if @entity17 had made sure systems were in place to protect residents			1
as it was , a vulnerable and elderly woman paid the price for their failures			0
‘ our investigation found there had been an alarming lack of communication with many staff unaware of @entity25 's medical needs , despite them being well documented			1
‘ she should never have been given un-pureed food , let alone been left by herself to eat it during the film and supper evening			0
but her condition meant she did not have the mental capability to refuse the meal or recognise the danger			0
‘ @entity125 was made aware of the risk of @entity25 choking on un-pureed food when she arrived , but failed to act properly and as you would expect on this information			0
sadly , she lost her life as a result			0
’ @entity29 ( pictured ) was told that @entity25 , who suffered from dementia and motor neurone disease , was admitted into @entity32 in november 2010 miss @entity25 's family also released the following statement after the case : ‘ we are grateful to the @entity18 for the professional and sensitive way in which they have liaised with our family following the disgraceful and unnecessary death of @entity2 , three years ago			1
‘ @entity2 was in the @entity32 for a mere two weeks before this frightening and tragic event occurred			2
‘ our hope is that the seriousness and financial implications of this case for the company will ensure that nothing like this will ever happen again at a @entity17 or any other care home			2
this would mean that @entity2 's tragic death will not have been entirely in vain			2
