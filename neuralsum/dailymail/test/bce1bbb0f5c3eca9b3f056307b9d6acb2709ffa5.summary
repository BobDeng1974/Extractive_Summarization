a crisp fan who gets through 42 bags in a week has discovered a skull - shaped deep - fried potato snack in one of his packets			1
@entity6 , 54 , who lives with his dog in @entity8 , @entity9 , was eating a bag of cheese and onion crisps when he made the bizarre discovery , which appears to be a profile of a human skull			1
the floor - fitter has decided to keep the two inches tall by two - and - a - half inches wide snack as he believes it is far more impressive than other oddly - shaped examples he has seen on the internet			1
i was just eating a bag of cheese and onion crisps from @entity25 and when i pulled it out it did take me back a bit			1
' i thought it was worth keeping as i do n't think i will ever find one like it again			0
it must have been a very weird - shaped potato			2
' it 's about two inches tall and two - and - a - half inches wide and it 's in perfect detail , it even has an eye socket			2
' i sometimes give my dog , @entity44 , crisps in a bowl , so it 's lucky he did n't have this packet or i would n't have found it			0
weird snack : mr @entity6 has decided to keep the unusual find , which appears to show a jaw , nose and eye comparison : the 54 - year - old said he was ' shocked ' to make the discovery , although it is not his first			1
in the 1990s he came across a @entity59 heart - shaped crisp , which he kept until it broke and it 's not the first odd - shaped snack he has come across - in the 1990s he found a crisp shaped like a 3d heart , which he kept for several years until it broke			1
but he says this find was different : ' this one was a big one			0
i just thought " wow " and wanted to share it			0
' i 've been keeping it on top of my computer in the front room , but it should be in a protective box really			0
' i 'm going to keep it forever , it 's just so spooky			0
i looked on the internet for other funny - shaped crisps but this is a one - off			2
