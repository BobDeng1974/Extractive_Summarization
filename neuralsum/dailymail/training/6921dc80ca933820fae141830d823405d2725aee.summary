by @entity0 last updated at 11:50 pm on 2nd march 2012 free : former - handyman @entity1 was found guilty of killing a woman in 1982 but was released on friday @entity1 glanced at the ceiling when a judge asked him if he was sure he wanted to plead guilty to the murder he has spent decades denying			1
he whispered to his lawyer , who had told him ' freedom is justice , ' and then looked toward the heavens again			2
' yes sir , ' he said quietly			0
with those words , he ended a 30 - year stint in prison that saw 30 of his friends on death row die			1
@entity1 was convicted three times of killing of @entity18 , with appeal courts overturning each verdict			1
@entity1 lived nearby and did odd jobs for the 75 - year - old widow , who was found in the closet of her @entity25 home in january 1982			1
she had been savagely beaten and stabbed more than 50 times , dying from a loss of blood and blows that caved in her chest , prosecutor @entity26 said			0
prosecutors agreed his punishment should be the 11,000 days @entity1 spent behind bars , much of it on death row			1
he got off death row in 2010 when his attorneys argued he was mentally disabled and had a low iq			1
the @entity42 @entity41 has ruled states ca n't execute the mentally disabled , and his punishment was reduced to life in prison			1
on friday , prosecutors dropped rape and burglary charges , and an hour after the hearing , @entity1 walked out of the @entity25 courthouse a free man to the cheers of those brothers and sisters			1
' what a great day , ' @entity1 said in the parking lot			2
@entity26 said he still thinks @entity1 killed @entity18			1

@entity1 's lawyers first asked the judge to throw out the charges			2
defense lawyer @entity90 has pointed out before that investigators found evidence at the crime scene that indicated @entity18 fought for her life , but @entity1 was uninjured when he was arrested hours later			1
a single blond hair was found on @entity18 ' body			1
@entity1 has black hair , and none of that was found at the scene			1
in the courtroom was former @entity103 reporter @entity102 , who has followed the case for more than a decade and recently wrote a book about it			0
he said police were anxious to make an arrest to allay a community 's fears that a rapist and murderer was among them and the little evidence that links @entity1 to the crime was planted			2
plea deal : @entity1 , accompanied at the hearing by his lead counsel and previous counsel , whispered ' freedom is justice ' as he agreed to plead guilty to murder even though he maintains his innocence new evidence : @entity1 walked out of the @entity25 general sessions courtroom a free man on friday after a single blonde hair found on the victim was discovered at the scene ' do n't dare call it justice , ' he said after the hearing			1
' a man served 30 years for a crime he did not commit			0
' @entity1 's lawyer wanted to see him exonerated			2
but she told him he could be convicted again in a trial and talking an @entity137 plea , where he maintains his innocence but admits there is a lot of evidence against him , was the best thing he could do			1
' freedom is justice and that 's why he is doing it today , ' @entity90 said			0
@entity90 has done this before			0
in may 2002 , she helped @entity148 get a similar deal after decades on @entity151 's death row			1
' it 's so bittersweet , ' @entity90 said			0
' but at least right now , the sweet outweighs the bitter			0
' @entity18 smile rarely faded after his release			2

' great guys in there , some of them , ' he said			0
overjoyed family : @entity1 's sister helped get his release by asking the judge to end her misery and decades of uncertainty and phone calls author @entity102 , left , was with @entity1 at the hearing on friday			1
@entity1 holds a copy of the book @entity172 , written by @entity102 about his case he also frowned when a reporter asked if he had anything to say to @entity18 ' family			1
@entity90 stepped in and said they would request the family 's wishes to not talk about the case			0
' it was 30 years for them too , ' she said			0
then the topic turned to lunch , and @entity1 's family was taking him to a buffet restaurant where he would have dozens of dishes , many of them greasy and flavorful , to choose from			2
@entity1 said prison was day after day of bland meals like liver or a chicken and gravy mixture			2
' that stuff was roadkill , ' @entity1 said			2
@entity1 's older sister @entity198 smiled			2
she remembered one of her brother 's chief complaints every time she would pile in a van with several of her siblings for the 150 - mile trip to see him on death row			1
' they ai n't got no onions , ' she recalled him saying			0
@entity209 was one of a half - dozen family members headed for the restaurant			0
just before she left , she was asked her plans now that her brother was going to be back in @entity25			0
she flashed a big smile			0
' we 're going to take him home and love him , ' she said			0
' and i do the cooking , so i am going to fatten him up			0
' @entity1 stood in the parking lot and took a deep breath			2
this was n't the way he thought this case should end , but for him , it was justice			0
watch the video here :			0

@entity1 maintains innocence in 1982 death of @entity18
new *dna* evidence , a blonde hair , would grant @entity1 a new trial
@entity1 pleaded guilty to murder on friday in exchange for release
had he been found guilty and sentenced to life in prison in a new trial , he would have immediately been eligible for parole on time served
@entity1 was on death row until 2010 when his lawyer argued he had such a low iq that he is mentally disabled
states ca n't execute mentally disabled so his sentenced was lowered to life
