by @entity0 @entity1 have made enquiries for @entity3 of @entity4 and @entity6 's @entity5			2
@entity7 international winger @entity3 is valued at £ 15m and may be beyond @entity1 's reach but @entity6 are willing to sell @entity9 winger @entity5 for £ 8million			1
the 25 - year - old is valued at £ 8million and @entity1 scouts have watched him closely in the @entity12 and playing for his national side notably against @entity14 in their @entity16 warm - up game and @entity17 on thursday night			0
money matters : @entity7 winger @entity3 is an @entity1 target , although £ 15m asking price may prove too high multi-tasking : @entity9 international @entity21 can play on the wing , as an attacking midfielder or second striker @entity5 only joined @entity6 from @entity25 18 months ago but they are looking at strengthening in other areas and will weigh up the strength of any @entity1 bid			1
@entity5 can play on the wing , as an attacking midfielder or as a second striker			0
he is quick , has good technique and gets goals , often spectacular , and is comfortable on the right or left			0
@entity1 also have an interest in @entity37 's @entity36 , 28 , as @entity38 is deliberating over their contract offer with @entity40 interested in the 33 - year - old free agent too .			2

@entity1 want to sign @entity43 , @entity21 and @entity36
@entity7 winger @entity3 is likely to be priced out of a move at £ *15million*
@entity48 midfielder @entity21 is more *attainable* at £ 8million
@entity37 's @entity50 is a *reserve* should @entity38 *decide* to join @entity40
