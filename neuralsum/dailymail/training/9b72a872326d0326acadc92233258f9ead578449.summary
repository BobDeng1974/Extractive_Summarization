by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:49 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:02 est , 17 december 2013 a judge ruled yesterday that one of the @entity6 fanatics who killed fusilier @entity7 has no defence to the charge of murder			1
mr @entity11 said nothing @entity12 , 29 , had offered in evidence about killing the 25 - year - old soldier ‘ amounts in law to a defence ’			1
the judge told the jury to ignore @entity12 ’s claim that he is ‘ a soldier of @entity21 ’ who is ‘ justified in doing what he did ’			1
@entity53 , 22 , his co-defendant , has refused to take the stand and no other evidence has been offered on his behalf			2
the case continues to be heard because the onus is on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the defendants			0
jurors returned to court yesterday for the closing speeches in the case from prosecution and defence barristers			2
message to jury : @entity11 ( pictured ) told the court : ' i have ruled that nothing he [ @entity12 ] said in evidence , such as he was a soldier of @entity21 , amounts to a law to a defence to this count ' in his closing speech , @entity79 , @entity80 , prosecuting , said the ‘ barbarous ’ actions of the defendants were ‘ indefensible in the law of this country ’ , but added : ‘ @entity6 , one of the world ’s great religions , is not on trial and nor can it be			1
’ @entity12 ’s barrister @entity89 suggested in his closing speech that his client was obeying a command from @entity93 and did not form the intention for murder			2
@entity12 has told the court he loved @entity97 and wanted to change @entity51 foreign policy by killing the 25 year - old @entity99			2
he added : ' i am a soldier			0
' the judge also told the jury they did not have to reach a verdict on the second charge of conspiracy to murder as this was dealt with by the attempted murder charges			1
he added : ' neither side will suffer any disadvantage as a result of its removal so for good reason i am going to discharge you from any further consideration of count two and it will play no part in my directions of law to you in due course			0
' drummer @entity7 's family were again there to hear the evidence			2
beginning his closing speech , prosecutor @entity125 said that after he was run over , according to @entity12 : ' @entity7 was slain by a mujahideen who struck his neck with a sharp instrument and sawed until his head almost became detached			1
gunfire : the armed officers shot @entity53 , right , and @entity12 , left on the floor after they hacked to death their victim in a @entity46 street shocking : this is the @entity137 that was used during the killing of fusilier @entity7 which was shown in court during the trial of @entity12 , 28 , and @entity53 , 22 evidence : this giant knife was found on the passenger seat of the vehicle that ploughed into @entity7 at 40mph on may 22			1
it was not used in the killing ' that is how he viewed the first part of his actions			0
it will be for you to decide the evidence in this case and to consider his acceptance that both he and his co-defendant are responsible for killing @entity7			1
testimony : @entity12 said he loved @entity97 and said its members were his ' brothers ' ' he denies murder and he does not accept the barbarous reality of what they did and the intimidation of the public and all those present			2
' mr @entity7 , a father - of - one from @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , was a member of the @entity170 in the @entity171 , the @entity172			2
he was knocked over by a @entity137 driven by @entity12 and @entity53 as he crossed the road near @entity174 in south @entity47 on 22 may this year			1
@entity12 then attempted to decapitate the soldier while @entity53 stabbed him in the torso before the pair dragged his mutilated body into the @entity179			1
both men were shot by armed police at the scene			2
recounting the events of may 22 and the prosecution 's case , mr @entity79 showed the jury once again images of bloodied knives , and also replayed the video clip in which @entity190 is seen being hit by a @entity137			2
' what was the consequence of driving into @entity7 ? ' asked mr @entity79			0
' the consequence was it broke his back			0
' replaying a video clip showing @entity195 being dragged into the road , mr @entity79 said : ' is this a humane killing ? background : @entity12 , 28 , pictured in a police interview , was brought up as a @entity199 but became a @entity6 when a student at @entity201 ' is this a killing with an attempt to decapitate and then deposit the body in the @entity179 causing traffic to stop and turn around ? ' mr @entity79 recalled witness accounts previously read to the jury as well as extracts from a note handed to @entity210 at the scene			1
' you will have to consider if that 's a suicide note , ' he said			0
' note that it contains the phrase " if i live beyond this day "			0
' what was the purpose of what they have done , killing @entity7 in the way the had done , in putting the body there and staying at the scene ? ' to borrow a phrase from the first defendant - carnage			1
' last seen : @entity7 was seen here getting off a @entity228 train at @entity229 , just before he was hacked to death on may 22 mr @entity79 turned to the charge of attempted murder of a police officer and described the defendants ' actions when police arrived at the scene			1
he told the jury not to be ' seduced by suggestions that the sole objective was to commit suicide '			0
describing @entity12 's movement , the prosecutor said : ' he had a meat cleaver , a weapon that needed to have direct contact			0
he raised the weapon above his head and got very close to the vehicle			0
' describing @entity53 's movement , he said : ' did he run straight at the vehicle to be caught ? he ran along the wall			0
why ? to draw fire			0
' @entity79 said : ' what these two men did , crashing their car and breaking the back of @entity7 and then killing him is indefensible in the law of this country			1
' he went on : ' killing to make a political point , to frighten the public , to put pressure on the government or as an expression of anger is murder and remains murder whether the government in question is a good one , a bad one , or a dreadful one			0
' ' brutal ' : the two men accused of the murder of fusilier @entity7 , @entity12 ( right ) and @entity53 ( second right ) hacked at @entity7 like ' he was a tree ' , witnesses said @entity89 , for @entity12 , quoted from a poem by @entity278 poet @entity277 , called report on experience , and told the jury that religion had been a ' red herring ' in the case			1
he went on : ' all deaths outside of lawful deaths are cruel , needless and unnecessary			0
' do you think really that this is the cruellest , most sadistic , most callous , most cowardly killing that 's ever occurred in our nation 's history ? it is n't			0
' mr @entity89 suggested that rather than murder , the proper charge for @entity12 would have been ' treason , terrorism , or maybe manslaughter ' - but later corrected himself by telling the jury that this has no legal basis as a defence			1
tragedy : drummer @entity7 relaxing on leave from the @entity305 in the year before his death , which was described in detail yesterday the defending barrister also suggested that @entity12 was ' the most law - abiding terrorist in the history of this country ' as his client paid for a parking ticket moments before the alleged murder took place			1
mr @entity89 told the jury that they ' genuinely have a choice ' to acquit his client , and that they will be under pressure ' from outside , from the mob , from the world , to convict '			1
turning to the attempted murder charge , he said it is ' possibly the most ridiculous charge ever put before a judge and jury in the history of this country '			0
mr @entity89 told the jury that there were unarmed police near the scene , but @entity12 chose to wait for armed teams , which would not fit with an intention to kill an officer			1
he had also underlined passages about martyrdom in documents found by police			0
the barrister went on to tell the panel of eight women and four men that the issue of what motivated @entity12 ' raises awkward questions ' for the @entity51 's political leaders			2
he said : ' a person , a human being , can do the most evil act in the world and not actually be evil themselves			0
' the barrister went on : ' all i 'm asking on behalf of my client is that you try this case according to the same standards that you would for anybody else			0
' @entity53 , also known as @entity7 , of @entity357 , and @entity12 , also known as @entity358 , of @entity359 , both deny murder and attempted murder of police officers			1
the trial was adjourned to tomorrow .			0

@entity12 and @entity53 admit killing @entity7 in may
but they deny murder on the basis they were ' soldiers of @entity21 '
justice @entity11 says argument does not ' amount to a defence '
prosecution say ' what these two men did is indefensible in the law '
defence tell the jury they ' genuinely have a choice ' to acquit suspects
men no longer face charges of conspiracy to murder a police officer
