a drug for men with advanced prostate cancer has been licensed for use earlier in the disease – delaying the need for chemotherapy			1
@entity7 extends life by at least five months in men who have run out of treatment options – with some living 18 months or longer			1
it is currently given to men who have stopped responding to hormone treatments or chemotherapy			1
the drug enzalutamide is currently given to men who have stopped responding to hormone treatments - but when given earlier can delay the need for chemotherapy and its distressing side effects ( pictured ) but new data shows that when given earlier in the course of the disease , the drug can delay the need for chemotherapy and its distressing side effects by 17 months			1
it cuts the risk of the disease progressing or death by more than three - quarters compared with ‘ dummy ’ treatment			0
doctors hope enzalutamide – which was discovered in the @entity30 – will help turn prostate cancer from a killer disease into a chronic illness by combining new and older agents together for longer survival			2
around 10,500 @entity30 men have advanced prostate cancer that has become resistant to standard hormone treatments , of whom about 6,000 might be eligible for pre-chemo treatment with enzalutamide			1
the drug , which is a pill taken at home , costs around £ 25,000 for an average course of treatment and it is not routinely available on the @entity46			1
some men in @entity48 have been able to get it via the @entity50 , for which manufacturer @entity51 reduced the price through a patient access scheme			0
the drug costs around £ 25,000 for a course of treatment and is not routinely available on the @entity46 dr @entity57 , consultant clinical oncologist at the @entity59 , said the drug was cost - effective because it improved quality of life , reduced the need for palliative radiotherapy and gp visits , and cut down emergency hospital care			1
she said ‘ for many men with advanced prostate cancer , enzlautamide has already shown that we can improve how long men live with this diagnosis and ensure they have good quality of life achieving all their milestones			2
’ she said men needing the drug were often breadwinners , or taking care of their grandchildren			0
‘ the pre-chemotherapy data is very good and today ’s approval for a new licence is a much needed development in prostate cancer ’ she said			2
@entity85 , chief executive of @entity87 @entity30 charity said ‘ @entity7 is a highly effective drug which we know can give men with advanced prostate cancer the extra quality time they need			1
‘ making it available for use pre chemotherapy is a no brainer			0
we hope today ’s announcement that enzalutamide is now licensed for use in this way means we can finally see it appraised to become routinely available on the @entity46			0
‘ @entity7 was already being made available to some patients pre-chemotherapy before receiving its licence			0
' this has been via the @entity50 in @entity48 and the @entity102 in @entity103			0
‘ this early access means that there is now real - world evidence of the drug ’s effectiveness , leaving @entity109 and the @entity110 with no excuse but to get on with the process of making it more widely available			0
a doctor at the @entity59 ( pictured ) said the drug was cost - effective because it improved quality of life , reduced the need for palliative radiotherapy and gp visits , and cut down emergency hospital care ‘ we also hope that the fact that men have been accessing pre chemotherapy enzalutamide before it received its licence heralds a much needed step change in how a drug ’s effectiveness is established , so that we have a faster , more effective appraisal process in the future			2
’ @entity131 , honorary chairman of tackle the charity , said ‘ it is great to have such a treatment for prostate cancer patients with advanced disease , where treatment choices are so limited			2
’ the drug , also known as @entity7 , was developed by @entity30 scientists at the @entity141 ( @entity141 ) and the @entity142 , @entity143 .			0
