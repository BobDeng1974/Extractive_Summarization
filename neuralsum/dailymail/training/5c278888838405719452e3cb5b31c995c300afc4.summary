support for the @entity2 @entity1 has reached a record 19 per cent , while both @entity4 and @entity5 are losing ground , it has emerged			1
despite a week of controversy , in which @entity1 leader @entity7 visited @entity10 and was locked in a pub by angry protestors , public backing for the party has never been higher			1
the @entity2 @entity1 leader said the left - wing extremists who trapped him were the ‘ ugly face of @entity19 nationalism ’ pursuing an anti-english agenda			1
however , poll results do not reflect the crowds who just this week shouted ' racist scumbag ' and ' scum ' at the leader , who has begun to pose a real threat as a major political party			1
@entity7 outside the @entity29 's @entity28 , @entity10 on thursday			1
the @entity1 leader retreated from protestors but will be in a more buoyant mood following latest poll figures @entity7 has no need to hold recruitment signs ( pic right ) as his party enjoys an unprecedented surge in support			1
he appeared on last sunday 's @entity42 in a discussion about an @entity45 referendum and his party 's supporters @entity7 's popularity was not mirrored in @entity10 , where he said ' @entity19 nationalists are @entity51 scum ' according to research , support for @entity4 was down three points to 35 per cent , the @entity5 were down one to 29 per cent and the @entity55 were unchanged on 8 per cent			1
the party - which has had a gaffe - ridden few weeks - has managed to appeal to the public so much so that there has been a four per cent jump in support in the last month			1
the @entity62 poll for the @entity63 and @entity64 gives @entity1 the highest share recorded by any pollster			2
since their shock win in an eastleigh - by - election in february , @entity1 representatives have produced a series of embarrassing moments for the party			2
@entity1 councillor @entity74 , 59 , resigned after posting racist cartoons and messages on @entity77			2
one included a picture of a nuclear weapon exploding emblazoned with the message : ' some cancers need to be treated with radiation , @entity78 is one of them '			0
he also shared an image of a @entity86 being roasted over a pile of burning @entity88 , as well as several anti-semitic outbursts linking the @entity91 banking dynasty to @entity92			0
in one comment he said in reference to @entity86 women : ' hang um all first then ask questions later			0
' the councillor from @entity98 , @entity99 , apologised to residents and party colleagues for his ' stupid ' actions but he denied being racist			0
@entity103 , a @entity1 candidate for @entity104 in @entity105 , was suspended from the party last month after being caught on camera apparently making a @entity109 salute , bringing further scandal to the party			1
comments saying that @entity114 ‘ lived in mud huts ’ and ‘ kill each other ’ also appeared under his name on the @entity77 page			0
it also emerged that @entity119 , a @entity1 candidate in @entity120 , is alleged to have made the homophobic comments on @entity77			2
he is said to have claimed that regular exercise ' prevents ' children from ' becoming ' gay			0
he also suggested the @entity126 method of physical exercise ' released tension and thus avoided homosexuality ' , but it was unclear whether these are mr @entity119 's views or whether he was just talking about @entity126 attitudes to sport and homosexuality			0
results show that the @entity1 leader 's image is appealing to the public			1
@entity5 council leader @entity139 said mr @entity7 ' uses soundbites that appeal to @entity5 ' labour leader @entity141 ( left ) and pm @entity142 have had seen their support dwindle at the hands of @entity1 the threat that @entity1 now poses was acknowledged by @entity5 council leader @entity139 , who said @entity142 needs to behave more like @entity7 to reverse @entity1 's rise			1
mr @entity139 accounted for the huge rise in popularity for the right - wing party , who are believed to be chipping away at the @entity5 's traditional supporters			0
he said : ‘ i am afraid the @entity1 leader has a style and a manner of speaking that connects with ordinary mortals much better than professional politicians			2
’ ‘ he is unafraid to be filmed with a pint of beer and a cigarette in his hand when all of our media training tells us to eschew either image			0
‘ he also uses soundbites that appeal to conservatives			0
’ his warning came as figures revealed @entity1 enjoyed a 51 per cent surge in members during the past 12 months , with many of them defecting from the @entity5			2
according to the study 46 % of @entity2 would vote to leave the @entity45 in a referendum now , compared with 24 % who would stay in			0
with the issue of an @entity45 referendum as the current hot topic , strategists are blaming @entity4 ’s own lack of clarity on @entity183 on the public 's disillusionment with the leadership			2
privately , @entity4 insiders are warning of a ‘ crisis of legitimacy ’ if the party only secures a 34 per cent share of the vote at the next general election			1
but if some powers were returned to the @entity2 from @entity195 43 % would vote to remain in the @entity45 , with just 24 % determined to see @entity2 leave			0
the poll found just 26 % said @entity142 was a good prime minister , a record low in @entity62 studies , while 31 % believed @entity141 was performing well as @entity4 leader , a new high			1
the survey revealed that 57 % of voters believed mr @entity142 's party was more divided over @entity183 than it was under sir @entity203 , with 14 % disagreeing			1
but there was some comfort for the prime minister , with 49 % of voters saying the offer of a @entity183 referendum would be important to them at the next general election , with 27 % disagreeing			0
and 32 % believed mr @entity142 would make the best prime minister of the party leaders , with 24 % opting for mr @entity141			0
@entity62 interviewed 2,017 @entity2 adults online on may 15/16 .			0
