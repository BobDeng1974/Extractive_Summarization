by @entity0 published : 07:24 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 15:14 est , 26 march 2013 young @entity2 women , provocatively dressed , gyrate sensuously to the sounds of @entity5 pop , trying to catch the eye of young men clad in muscle shirts and leather jackets			1
with the austere , car boot sale - like surroundings and the downmarket nightclub dress code , it 's no wonder the event they are taking part in has been locally dubbed the ' bridal market '			1
love is not exactly for sale in this poverty - stricken corner of @entity21			1
but amid the flirtation in the litter - strewn car park venue , families are weighing their finances against the merits of prospective brides			2
globalisation has added to their precarious economic position			2
the families gathered here are part of a community of about 18,000 @entity2 known as @entity63 , who traditionally make a living as coppersmiths			1
now that historic trade is dying out , in part because traditional copper pots and pans are being replaced by less expensive goods from the ever - smoking factories of @entity72			2
nevertheless , at the bridal fair a festival atmosphere hangs in the air			1
even those girls still too young to be considered for marriage wear gobs of mascara , flashy jewellery and towering heels			1
their mini-dresses are electric pink , blood red or canary yellow			2
the boys wear tight black jeans and muscle shirts , often topped with a black leather jacket			1
despite the bleak surroundings , some 2,000 people have shown up in high spirits , many in cars rigged with speakers on the hoods to pump out @entity5 pop at full blast			2
boys and girls dance side - by - side on the cars , shaking their hips in a frenzy of barely repressed sexuality			1
the exuberance stems largely from the fact that , due to the community 's conservative values , youths are rarely allowed to mingle with the opposite sex			2
austere surroundings : the families gathered here are part of a community of about 18,000 @entity2 known as @entity63 , who traditionally make a living as coppersmiths but who face fierce competition from @entity72 tradition : talk of brides being sold angers the @entity124			1
they say the marriage fair is a tradition that actually works , keeping communities and extended families intact for generations			1
@entity63 , who are almost all devout @entity47 , are known to remove girls from school at 15 or even earlier to keep them safe from temptation			1
@entity134 is one of the young women to travel to the fair with her family , in the hope of snaring a suitable suitor			1
dressed in a skintight mini-dress , with her make - up dilligently applied , she joins her sisters in a provocative dance - hoping to look her best for the many boys also in attendance			1
at 19 , @entity134 is prime marrying age			2
' i hope to meet new people and to see the parents of the boys , so our parents can meet him , ' she says			2
' it 's a good tradition			0
it 's easier for us if our parents approve			0
' it starts , like a high school dance , with groups of boys and girls in separate clumps , occasionally shaking hands and checking each other out - while mothers and fathers stay discreetly in the background			1
apart from these twice - a - year bridal fairs , boys and girls only have contact in @entity173 chats			1
so @entity134 is happy to leave the realm of @entity175 and meet real young men			0
at the fair , there is no shortage of youths held in thrall by the way she dances with her sisters , who also wear their showiest clothes			2
' i want to find someone who is easy to get along with , ' she says , taking a pause from dancing in high - heeled sandals			0
' someone whose parents wo n't interfere after we are together , and someone who 's not too rich and not too poor and has a job			0
' @entity194 : @entity2 brides - to - be dance in a car park ( left ) while others don their brightest and most attention - grabbing dresses purity : although the idea that a young woman must be a virgin when she marries has generally faded in many segments of @entity21 society , it remains strong among the @entity2 @entity207 : @entity63 , who are almost all devout @entity47 , are known to remove girls from school at 15 or even earlier to keep them safe from temptation the event 's reputation as a ' bridal market ' goes back generations			1
it used to take place in a muddy open field next to a horse - trading market in a small village , where brides - to - be stood on stage with suitors competing for their hand			2
police this year moved it into a city to avoid tension with the horse traders			0
still , the flirtations can lead to negotiations and a possible union a few months down the road			2
if the youths warm to each other , the fair can trigger complex financial negotiations about the price a young man 's family must pay to a woman 's parents if they are to be married			2
the cost of a bride - between 5,000 and 10,000 lev ( £ 2,200 to £ 4,300 ) - has dropped in recent years as jobs have dried up			0
and wedding festivities are much more modest with cash so tight			0
but prices still rise for a ' very beautiful ' young woman with many suitors , said @entity250 , who has written extensively about the @entity124			0
some say this is an innocent payment for the cost of a wedding dress and the elaborate wedding feasts of @entity2 tradition			1
others say it 's the price families are willing to pay for their sons to have a woman believed to be a virgin			0
' we are maintaining the morals of the children by marrying them off at a young age , ' said @entity268 , a spectator at the fair			1
' if she 's not a virgin , the bride 's family has to give the money back			0
' he said @entity21 's crushing financial slowdown , and the near total collapse of the coppersmith industry , has made it virtually impossible for his family to raise the money needed to find wives for his three grandsons , aged 18 , 20 and 22			1
' they have no jobs and their parents ca n't pay money to the bride 's family , ' he said			0
' it 's a crisis now			0
' nerves : it starts , like a high school dance , with groups of boys and girls in separate clumps , occasionally shaking hands and checking each other out - while mothers and fathers stay discreetly in the background negotiations : the @entity124 , unlike other @entity2 communities , do not allow girls to marry at an extremely young age - most are 18 or older - giving virginity an even higher premium although the idea that a young woman must be a virgin when she marries has generally faded in many segments of @entity21 society , it remains strong among the @entity2 , particularly those who follow @entity47 teachings			1
the @entity124 , unlike other @entity2 communities , do not allow girls to marry at an extremely young age - most are 18 or older - giving virginity an even higher premium			1
but they have started to modernise			0
it is now widely recognized that the young people need to have feelings for each other			0
' that is the first and most important step now , ' said mr @entity250 , a member of the @entity323			0
' in the past , parents did n't ask the young people whether they liked each other			0
' but the second step is that when they have decided they like each other and the parents agree , they start negotiating what the price will be for the bride			0
' talk of brides being sold angers the @entity124 , who represent a small proportion of @entity21 's 700,000 @entity2			1
they say the marriage fair is a tradition that actually works , keeping communities and extended families intact for generations			1
indeed , it is easy to find men and women in their late 30s and early 40s who met at a bridal fair two decades ago and today are hoping now to make matches for their children			1
many who found a mate here five or six years ago come back to help their younger siblings or cousins get hitched			0
@entity353 married her husband @entity354 in 2008 after a courtship sparked at the bridal fair			1
she came to this year 's event to help her 20 - year - old cousin navigate the sea of suitors			0
' she is nervous and there are several grooms possible , ' @entity353 said			0
' she has not decided , and she ca n't decide by herself			0
we are asking her opinion but she also has to recognize our opinion			0
' that opinion does n't hinge on the groom alone			0
' i am here to meet the families , ' she said			0
' to see if they have the wealth to support the bride			0

the ' bridal market ' is the only *opportunity* for teenage girls and boys from the @entity21 @entity2 to mix
the strict @entity47 often remove their girls from school as early as the age of 15 to keep them from temptation
relationships blossom from the meetings at the fair , but can only lead to marriage if an *acceptable* dowry is agreed
