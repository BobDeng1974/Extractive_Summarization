by @entity0 traditional families with married parents and two children are a thing of the past and ' patchwork ' families should be celebrated , a leading @entity9 theologian has claimed			2
@entity10 , a former pupil of pope @entity11 , said the @entity12 must drop ' moralising statements ' about the ideal family set - up and embrace single working parents			1
his words come as the @entity17 announced tax breaks for working mothers worth up to £ 2,000 a year for every child under 12			1
embrace alternatives : professor @entity10 claims the ' idol ' of married parents with two children is a construct of the industrialised west change : professor @entity10 claims the early @entity12 would not recognise ' traditional ' family units the state - backed childcare package released in last week 's @entity29 came under fire from @entity32 mps claiming ' traditional families ' with a stay - at - home parent are put at a disadvantage			1
but professor @entity10 , master of @entity37 at the @entity38 , welcomed the idea of a broader definition of ' family '			1
he branded nuclear families ' an idol of the modern industrialised west ' , which the early @entity12 would find bizarre			1
' biblical concepts of the family often transcend biological considerations and refer to larger households which can include relatives of different degrees , an intergenerational community , visitors , and workers / helpers / slaves , ' he told @entity55			0
' all too often the increasing numbers of people who live alone are not at all present in the — at times — too many and too much moralising statements on the ' @entity61 ' family			0
' he added : ' our so - called patchwork families ought to be of interest to a church so used to changing concepts of family			0
' it is the attention to @entity71 that unites a @entity61 family , not the adherence to shifting codifications of its boundary			0
' professor @entity10 is master of @entity37 , @entity38 , which has just decided to admit female undergraduates , and is a former pupil of @entity11 , who many say left an overlooked progressive legacy @entity82 , of campaign group mothers at @entity84 , said : ‘ it ’s a disgrace that taxpayers ’ money will be used to contribute to the childcare bill of families earning up to £ 300,000			1
the @entity90 need to take a trip to reality street			0
’ the government insisted it is taking various steps to provide support for stay - at - home parents – including a new universal state pension crediting years spent caring for children and a transferable marriage tax allowance to be introduced from next year			2
but that will be worth just £ 200 a year , to the dismay of @entity32 critics			0
former children ’s minister @entity103 said : ‘ the state is disproportionately geared up to pushing parents into being working parents			2

@entity10 , a @entity11 @entity11 pupil , tells @entity12 to embrace change
@entity110 ' would *n't* recognise nuclear unit made for industrialised @entity112 '
comes as @entity17 *blasted* by @entity114 over working mothers ' tax break
