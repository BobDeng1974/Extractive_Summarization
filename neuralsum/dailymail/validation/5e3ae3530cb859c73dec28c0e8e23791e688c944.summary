girls star @entity0 has been caught up in an anti-semitism row after writing a controversial article comparing her @entity4 boyfriend and her dog			1
the 28 - year - old prompted the storm after writing a quiz in the march 30 edition of @entity11 - asking readers if a number of statements referred to her dog or boyfriend @entity15			1
they included : ' he does n’t tip ' , ' he never brings his wallet anywhere ' and ' he has hair all over his body , like most males who share his background '			2
ms @entity0 , whose own mother is @entity4 , has been criticised by @entity25 users , as well as the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) - an organisation which fights anti-semitism and all forms of bigotry			1
dog or @entity4 boyfriend ? ' girls ' star @entity0 , pictured here with her boyfriend @entity15 , has been criticised for an article some claim is anti-semitic quiz : @entity0 asked : ' do the following statements refer to ( a ) my dog or ( b ) my @entity4 boyfriend ? ' she is pictured with her dog @entity42 row : ms @entity0 , whose own mother is @entity4 , has been criticised by @entity25 users , as well as the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) - an organisation which fights anti-semitism and all forms of bigotry also among the 35 statements were ' my grandma @entity47 loves him and says he ’s a “ good , good boy " ' and ' bald men trigger a primal fear in him '			1
@entity53 , @entity26 national director , said : ' some will certainly find @entity0 ’s stereotypes about cheap @entity56 offensive			1
others will take issue with the very idea of comparing a dog and a @entity4 boyfriend			1
' while we understand that humor is its own special brand of expression and always try to give leeway to comedians , we wish that she had chosen another , less insensitive way to publicly reflect on her boyfriend ’s virtues and vices			2
' we are surprised that the @entity11 chose to print it			2
' @entity25 users were quick to criticise the piece , while others used it as an opportunity to troll the star			2
one user wrote : ' i am so glad @ @entity81 finally has taken on the task of charging people for their @entity4 humor			1
@entity85 tov ! ' earlier today , one wrote : ' whoa ... yikes			0
besides it being offensive , it is n't even close to funny , let alone original			2
i get being edgy ... but lame			0
' choice : also among the 35 statements were ' my grandma @entity47 loves him and says he ’s a “ good , good boy " ' and ' bald men trigger a primal fear in him other @entity25 users jumped to her defence			2
one said : ' is n't @entity4 ? what 's the big deal ? ' the @entity102 editor - in - chief @entity101 also baked the publication 's use of the piece in a statement released on saturday and condemned those who had whipped up the storm on social media			1
it read : ' the @entity4 - comic tradition is rich with the mockery of , and playing with , stereotypes			1
' anyone who has ever heard @entity115 or @entity116 or @entity117 or who has read ‘ @entity120 ’ knows that			0
@entity0 , who is @entity4 and hugely talented , is a comic voice working in that vein			1
' @entity123 and @entity124 do the same about black stereotypes ; @entity126 does it with women and gender			0
i do n’t mind if one reader or another did n’t find the piece funny			0
people can differ on that			0
' but considering all the real hatred and tragedy in the world , the people getting exercised about the so - called anti-semitism of this comic piece , like those who railed at @entity141 a generation or two ago , are , with respect , howling in the wrong direction			0
' ms @entity0 lives with her boyfriend , @entity146 guitarist @entity15 , who she met on a blind date organised by mutual friends			1
it is the latest in a series of controversies involving the star			1
the quiz in @entity11 's march 30 edition included statements like ' he does n’t tip ' , ' he never brings his wallet anywhere ' and ' he has hair all over his body , like most males who share his background ' in january she was forced to apologize after suggesting the storm over @entity166 's rape allegations is as significant as the slaughter of millions of @entity56 while speaking to the @entity168			1
referring to @entity170 's ' obsession ' with the revelations , she said : ' it ’s sort of like saying someone ’s obsessed with the @entity174			1
' this is a huge issue , and it speaks to the way that we abuse power and the way that celebrity allows for injustice			0
' in december she claimed she was raped by an acquaintance in college , detailed in a passage from her new book @entity188			0
some accused her of making it up but she has since stuck by her story			0
during a chapter she says a ' flamboyant @entity194 conservative ' that she met at @entity195 in @entity196 identified as ' @entity197 ' , attacked her at a party			0
in november it emerged that she was suing @entity201 website after they claimed she sexually abused her little sister when they were children			0
the claim is based on an excerpt from the @entity208 star and creator 's new book , @entity211 , and details how she once looked at her sister @entity213 's vagina when her sibling was a year old and she was seven			0
@entity0 defended the action as innocent childhood exploration based on curiosity , but the website @entity201 called the memory ' unsettling ' and ' disturbing '			2
the website adamantly declined , with editor @entity220 wrote explaining why they would not heed to the demands of @entity0 's lawyers			1
we refuse to withdraw our story or apologize for running it , because quoting a woman ’s book does not constitute a “ false ” story , even if she is a prominent actress and left - wing activist			0
' @entity0 may not like our interpretation of her book , but unfortunately for her and her attorneys , she wrote that book – and the @entity236 covers a good deal of material she may not like , the article reads			1

we love her satin dress , which featured a deep v - shaped back and a dramatic dipped hem			0
it 's by @entity259 , a designer who is no stranger to the red carpet			0
the likes of @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264 are all fans , but the best news is that @entity0 's @entity268 collection dress is actually available to buy			1
