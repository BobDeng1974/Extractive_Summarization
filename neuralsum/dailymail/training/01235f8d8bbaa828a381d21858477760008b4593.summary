by @entity0 published : 09:34 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 17:47 est , 14 march 2014 when morbidly obese @entity4 ’ wife @entity3 told him her dying wish was for him to lose weight he vowed he would turn his life round			1
for forty years he ’d never exercised and had lived on an unhealthy diet of curries , chips , pizzas and chocolate			1
now , just over a year since he lost his wife to @entity14 , he is a changed man			1
@entity4 has shed nearly ten stone and admits he is now hooked on running			1
@entity4 ( left as he is now ; right at 24st ) has lost 10st since his wife died of breast cancer a year ago next month , on april 13th , he will run the @entity17 in her memory and he says every time he runs , he feels her alongside him			1
and he knows she will be looking down with pride when he runs the race in the city where she was born , aiming to raise £ 100,000 for @entity24			2
@entity4 , 58 , from @entity25 , said : ' @entity3 ’s dying wish was for me to lose weight			1
she said to me , " you ca n’t carry on as you are			2
you ’ve got to be here for the dogs			2
" ' it broke my heart			2
our two dogs , @entity36 and @entity37 were our world			2
i knew i had to change as they could n’t lose their mum and their dad			1
' @entity3 died of metastatic breast cancer in february last year aged 71 after six years of treatment including a mastectomy , chemotherapy , radiotherapy and tablets			1
when she came off her five - year course of medication last november , both she and @entity4 believed they had beaten the disease and started making plans for the future			1
then last @entity54 , @entity3 complained of feeling unwell and after a few weeks her condition worsened			2
@entity4 and his wife @entity3 , who passed away from breast cancer aged 71 she was rushed to hospital where scan revealed the cancer had returned with a vengeance			1
she died just six days after being admitted			2
@entity4 said : ' i just felt numb			1
i sat there in a side room on the ward and could n't take it in			2
it seemed like one minute she was there and we were making plans and the next minute she was gone			2
' i felt not just alone , i felt vulnerable and alone			2
after her funeral i realised how much in bad shape i was			2
' at the time , @entity4 , who is 6ft 3in , tipped the scales at 24st , giving him @entity77 of 42 which made him morbidly obese			1
he had type 2 diabetes and could barely walk up stairs			2
' i was in a terrible way and i ’d been in denial about my health for many years			1
but losing @entity3 made me realise i had to change			2
' i was n't going to become the sad , lonely , fat old man in the corner house			0
i was determined to reinvent myself and make @entity3 proud			0
before losing weight @entity4 had trouble even walking up the stairs and had a @entity77 of 42 ' not only that , i also wanted to do something to help others going through what me and @entity3 had			1
i wanted her death to make a difference			1
' true to his word , after @entity3 's death @entity4 wasted no time ans sprung into action in order to fulfill his wife 's final wish			1
' two months after i lost her , i joined @entity102 , my local gym , to get fit			1
at first , i could n’t even walk for a minute on the treadmill			0
' but the staff there were lovely and supportive and i was determined i would run			0
i signed up for the @entity107 in september , and i told myself i would complete it			0
' it was very much one step at a time , and a walk became a run and each time i ’d try to go that little bit longer			0
' after a few months i ventured outside , running round my local park , which was just one kilometre			0
' then i built it up and up , so i ’d be ready for the race that day			0
i also asked friends and family to sponsor me and raised £ 1600 for @entity24 which really spurred me on			0
' since losing nearly ten stone , @entity4 's diabetes is now classed as dormant @entity4 says that he has become addicted to running and has started his own blog - running with @entity3 @entity4 , a newspaper editor , also changed his diet dramatically			1
before , he ’d had a fry - up for breakfast , mid-morning snacks of crisps or chocolate , a lunch from the chip shop or curry house then pie and chips when he got home			1
he even admitted to eating the occasional sandwich whilst cooking his dinner			0
now it ’s strictly porridge or scrambled egg whites for breakfast , a protein shake mid-morning , a salad for lunch , a piece of fruit mid-afternoon and a main meal of chicken or oily fish plus vegetables for dinner			0
' @entity3 ’s dying wish was for me to lose weight			1
she said to me , " you ca n’t carry on as you are			0
you ’ve got to be here for the dogs			0
" ' @entity4 now weighs just over 15st , has dropped seven shirt sizes and lost eight inches around his waist and hopes to reach his 14st target for the 26.2 mile race			1
he explained : ' i stopped the biscuits , pastries , ready meals , pizzas , curries and cheese			1
i love them all but they 're just not compatible with what i was trying to achieve			0
' that 's not to say i have n't eaten those things in the last 12 months but just as occasional treats and i feel guilty afterwards			1
' instead i now eat slow release carbs like porridge , yams , granary bread , wholewheat pasta , brown rice and more fruit and veg			0
' @entity4 said that losing the weight has also been beneficial to his diabetes too			1
' not only have i lost the weight , but i also feel more energised and better mentally too			1
my diabetes is now classed as dormant , so i have the same blood sugar levels as most people			0
' @entity4 has already completed several 10km runs and half marathons in @entity186 and @entity187 and aims to do the @entity17 on april 13th in under five hours			1
@entity3 ( right ) wanted her husband to get fit so that he could take care of their beloved dogs ( pictured left ) he said : ' we wanted to go before @entity3 passed away but the cancer returned and we never made it there			1
' but i have been there since			0
i see it as the place where she learned to be the wonderful woman she was , and have met her friends who will be there to support me on the day			0
' i am not a runner , never have been			0
but i have become passionate about it , something that i never dreamed would happen , and the only reason i can think of is that @entity3 has decided i needed to make a difference			0
' to support his fund - raising , he has started the online community blog running with @entity3 at runningwithdiane.blogspot.co.uk and on @entity211 @ runwithdiane			0
@entity4 said of his blog : ' those three words sum up how i feel when i ’m running			1
i did n't want people to say i was running ' in her memory ' or ' for ' her			0
' to me , i was running with her			0
she is my inspiration and driving force			0
i know the marathon will be tough , but when i need to dig deep , i will think of her			0
' every time i run , she runs with me			0
we have done everything together for over 20 years			2
why should now be any different ? ' @entity223 's not beaten her			2
it took her body but it could n't touch what made her special			0
we 'll always have that			0
especially when we 're running together			0
