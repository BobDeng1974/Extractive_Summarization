by @entity0 published : 04:56 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 09:01 est , 9 november 2012 a doctor has been reprimanded after hundreds of children were given the wrong vaccines			1
the incorrect vaccines were given to 221 children by the gp in @entity7 , south @entity8 , as a single jab instead of separate vaccinations			1
re-vaccinations are now being offered to all the children affected who were given jabs between january 2009 and april this year			1
the incorrect vaccines were given as a single jab instead of separate vaccinations ( posed by models ) the jabs were supposed to protect the children against diptheria , whooping cough , polio , tetanus , hib and measles , mumps and rubella			1
national guidelines state these should be given separately to ensure maximum protection			2
instead , they were mixed and given as one			2
mother - of - three @entity30 , 34 , whose five - year - old daughter @entity31 was wrongly vaccinated , said she got a letter on tuesday informing her of the error and offering re-vaccination			1
she said : ' you put your trust in a doctor to do things right			2
it is disgusting what has happened and in my eyes it shows incompetence			2
' @entity31 was given the injection when she started nursery at three years old and she is nearly six			0
so for three years she has been walking round and has not been immunised			0
the jabs were supposed to protect the children against diptheria , whooping cough , polio , tetanus , hib and measles , mumps and rubella ' it is a massive failure , if anything else			1
i ’m going to complain to the @entity61			0
' @entity62 , 26 , also of @entity7 , received a letter for her six - year - old who was vaccinated at the surgery more than two years ago			1
she said : ' it is ridiculous that she has not been protected all this time			0
i remember taking her for the injection and them being mixed together and never thought anything of it because you trust your doctor			0
' the blunder was brought to the attention of @entity76 public health team in april by a healthcare professional			1
since then , the trust has reviewed every child ’s medical records from the practice , looked at every vaccination they received and traced the children involved			2
dr @entity85 , the medical director at @entity7 , has written to all the parents offering reassurance and re-vaccination after receiving advice from the @entity90			1
@entity91 , head of public health for @entity7 said : ' in april we became aware that some children at one gp practice in @entity7 were given some routine childhood vaccinations which were mixed together into a single vaccination when they should have been given separately			1
' @entity98 was taken immediately once this was identified to ensure no further vaccinations were given in this way			0
the gp practice is now giving immunisations in lione with national guidance			0
' we have worked quickly to investigate the issue and to identify those parents that needed to be informed			0
' the doctor involved has been required to undertake extra training and participate in a mentoring programme			0
staff at the surgery declined to comment .			0
