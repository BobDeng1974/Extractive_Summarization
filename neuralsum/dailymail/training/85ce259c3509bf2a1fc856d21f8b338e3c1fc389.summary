@entity0 told host @entity43 : ' it seems to me that it 's the obligation of the @entity47 to call them			0
' @entity2 made a mistake by backing off , and i think , quite frankly the president made a mistake by not being assertive '			2
he said @entity1 ought to have gathered executives from @entity2 , movie theater chains , and his spies , and asked them : ' @entity55 , what 's the nature of the threat and what can we do to stop it			2
is there a safe way to show this movie ? ' ' that 's what a leader does ' , @entity0 said			0
@entity2 pulled in film after weeks of embarrassing revelations about the company , prompted by caches of emails and other information dumped online by hacking cell guardians of @entity74			2
the group - which the @entity76 later said was a front for the @entity31 government - demanded that the studio cancel the film , which ridicules @entity80 , the country 's @entity81			0

asylum : @entity95 , left , was imprisoned for killing @entity16 state trooper @entity96 , right , but escaped jail and fled to @entity20 he said the deal should not have been made while officials continue to grant asylum to a woman who killed a @entity16 state trooper in the 1970s - and was a poor deal for the @entity21 to begin with			1

he said : ' these thugs in @entity20 have given her political asylum for 30 years			0
