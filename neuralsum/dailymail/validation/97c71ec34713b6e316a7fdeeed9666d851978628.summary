the pathetic excuses from friends and colleagues defending @entity3 have been a joke			1
unfortunately for arguably @entity7 ’s greatest - ever player , he proved on sunday that @entity8 has made the correct decision to cut him loose from @entity10 at the end of this season			1
i ’d be surprised if @entity3 makes the @entity7 starting line - up again , and any substitute appearances will surely only be to give the fans a wave goodbye			1
why should @entity8 trust @entity3 again this season ? @entity3 looks dejected after seeing red just 38 seconds after coming on for @entity7 at @entity10 @entity3 stamped on @entity20 's right leg shortly after coming on at the start of the second half @entity20 gestures and points at @entity3 as the @entity7 midfielder reacts following the challenge this is an experienced professional , a captain , a legend and there is nothing anyone can say that should mask the truth that he absolutely let everyone at @entity7 down			1
he also failed to apologise to @entity20 in his brief post-match interview , which showed a lack of class			1
some said @entity3 was frustrated because he was n’t in the starting line - up			2
that might be true , but it does n’t excuse a violent stamp on an opponent ’s ankle			0
others have said he was desperate to get involved and show his passion			0
after all his years in the game , with all his knowledge of this fixture , he must surely know there is only one way to show passion and commitment on such a huge occasion – and that ’s to make good , clean tackles , play well and get the job done			0
this was @entity7 ’s biggest game of the season , against fierce rivals , it ’s a game they ’re losing when he comes on the pitch and it ’s a game they need to win			2
@entity7 captain @entity3 looks baffled after seeing referee @entity71 brandish a red card @entity3 walks off the @entity10 pitch in what was his last appearance against @entity76 in a @entity7 shirt if @entity79 had done it , the reaction would be far worse			1
there would be calls to strip him of the @entity85 captaincy			0
if it had been @entity87 , the reaction would have hit fever pitch			0
had it been a @entity90 player – well , the internet and the @entity92 would have been in meltdown			0
there would have been talk of points deductions probably			0
but because it was @entity3 , the appropriate outrage has been tempered because apparently , according to the apologists , @entity8 made a mistake by failing to put him in the starting line - up			2
@entity3 ( centre ) walks past @entity8 ( left ) as @entity102 ( right ) listens to instructions from his boss @entity105 midfielder @entity87 would have been ridiculed if he had made such a challenge last season ’s slip against @entity90 was accidental , the stamp on sunday was calculated : at best it was @entity3 being a careless hot - head desperate to make a mark			2
at worst , it looked like a reckless player who is now past caring about the fortunes of his club			0
@entity3 was the main man responsible for one of @entity7 ’s most glorious nights back in 2005 in @entity118			1
nobody can ever take that away from him			0
ten years on , there ’s a good chance that @entity3 ’s last significant act for his club could be a red card that proves to be a major factor in handing @entity76 a passage back into the @entity126 – at @entity7 ’s expense			1
@entity3 ’s legacy is shattered			2
it ’s a sad and sorry way to go , but he only has himself to blame			0
the @entity7 captain has been mocked for slipping against @entity90 during the clash back in april 2014 @entity3 will want to be remembered for leading @entity7 to @entity126 glory in may 2005			1
