amid the warm waters of the @entity3 spa in a lava field in south - west @entity5 , @entity0 relaxes and reflects with his girlfriend			1
three years ago , it was he who was erupting , the then @entity9 captain arrested and later accepting a police caution for damaging five vehicles in @entity12 during a night out with team - mates			1
earlier that day , @entity14 had been confirmed as his new manager ; it was hardly @entity0 ’s wisest move and merely served to vandalise his own character			1
@entity9 midfielder @entity0 insists he has calmed down from the unpredictable player he once was @entity19 readily admits @entity0 is among the first names on his @entity9 team sheet current @entity9 boss @entity19 was certainly sceptical upon his arrival one year ago			1
‘ if somebody tells me this guy is a b * * * * * d and i need to be careful , then i will be			0
i was told he was impossible to control , that he will get sent off a hundred times and he will let you down , ’ says @entity19			1
‘ i was told he could not play football like i want to			0
i was told he was training on his own away from everybody else			0
i thought i ’d meet @entity0 and he ’d have a gun and he ’d shoot me in the head			2
’ twelve months on and @entity19 readily admits that @entity0 is the first name on his team sheet			1
the 26 - year - old has just been voted @entity37 and the manager is backing his on - field lieutenant for an @entity41 call - up — ‘ in @entity42 , he would be the hero , the captain , ’ he says			2
@entity0 says he has come a long way in 12 months under @entity19			1
‘ in the last year i have learned a hell of a lot , ’ says the anchorman			0
@entity19 took over as manager of @entity9 in october 2013 and continues to work with @entity0 ‘ @entity19 coming in has been a massive factor in winning the award , which i ’m chuffed about			1
@entity19 is very much my kind of person , very @entity41 minded			2
‘ it is totally different playing under @entity19 than any other manager			1
i think he played street football a lot more			0
he almost taught himself , which is why he was a very natural player			0
‘ and he has told me in no uncertain terms that , in the position i play , if i do n’t do what he wants then i wo n’t play			0
on and off the pitch this is as good as i have ever felt			0
the manager has stuck with me			2
’ as @entity0 suggests , off the pitch was a big issue — there was a three - year ban from pubs in his hometown of @entity70 in 2008			2
‘ i have calmed down off the pitch as well as on it , ’ he says			0
‘ i had a couple of incidents during my career which people have read too much into			0
‘ i have just matured and i even have a girlfriend now			2
when anyone is 26 they look back to when they were 18 and there is a world of difference — and i am no different			0
’ indeed , pubs have made way for geothermal spas and romantic getaways in @entity88 lava land			0
@entity0 — and @entity19 — will be hoping his days of boiling over are a thing of the past			1
@entity0 says he has ' matured ' at @entity9 and puts it in no small way down to @entity19 's management			1

@entity19 took over as @entity9 manager in october 2013
@entity19 was cautious of @entity0 *due* to his *reputation* at first
but @entity0 admits he has ' matured ' under @entity19 's management
