as he lingers in the centre of the road waiting for cars to pass so he can cross safely , @entity6 is clipped by a passing van , sending him sprawling to the floor			1
then , as he lies stricken , a car ploughs into him at high speed			2
sickeningly the wheels pass straight over the man			0
the driver appears not to notice			0
he is pictured moments before the first impact the man is clipped by the van and sent sprawling into the road the man lies stricken in the road after being knocked off his feet , as a speeding car bears down on him horrifying : the car slams into the pedestrian , rolling over his prone body pedestrians saw the injured man and went to help him , but as the good samaritans signal for a car to stop , a second car rear ends it , sending the vehicle lurching forwards and into the prone @entity6			1
amazingly , it was reported that @entity6 survived and is now recovering in hospital after sustaining several fractures in his leg and ribs			2
