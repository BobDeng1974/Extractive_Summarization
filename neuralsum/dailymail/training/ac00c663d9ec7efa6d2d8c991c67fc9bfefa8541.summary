palaces , yachts , white gold watches and a £ 47,000 toilet on his plane are just a few of the presidential perks @entity8 enjoys , according to a damning new report			1
in 2008 the reinstalled @entity11 president famously compared his life in office to a ' galley slave ' during a press conference			0
but now a lavish list of luxuries at his disposal have been revealed by @entity20 , a former deputy prime minister turned @entity8 critic			1
@entity20 estimated that the maintenance of @entity8 's residences , jets and cars alone costs £ 1.6 billion a year			1
life of luxury : palaces , yachts , white gold watches , and a $ 75,000 toilet on his plane are just a few of the presidential perks @entity8 enjoys , according to a new report the 32 page document listed 58 planes and helicopters and 20 homes with opulent fittings worthy of the tsars , not to mention 11 watches which alone are worth several times @entity8 's annual salary			1
published under the ironic title ' the life of a @entity45 ' , it denounced the lavish spending as an affront to millions of @entity11 living in dire poverty			0
among the 32 - page report , eye - catching details included : 20 palace and villas : with opulent fittings worthy of the tsars 15 helicopters 43 aircraft available include : an @entity56 , two @entity58 executive jets and an @entity60 airliner that features an $ 11 million cabin fitted out by jewelers - and that toilet which , the report says , cost close to £ 47,000 53.7 - metre yacht : with a designer interior , a spa pool , waterfall and wine cellar 11 luxury watches five - decked yacht : with a jacuzzi , barbecue , a maple wood colonnade and a huge bathroom faced in marble ' one of the most serious reasons prompting @entity8 to hold on to power is the atmosphere of wealth and luxury to which he has become accustomed , ' wrote the authors			1
' one of the most serious reasons prompting @entity8 to hold on to power is the atmosphere of wealth and luxury to which he has become accustomed , ' wrote the authors			2
' in a country where more than 20 million people barely make ends meet , the luxurious life of the president is a blatant and cynical challenge to society			2
we absolutely can not put up with this			0
' the @entity99 fleet of luxury yachts may draw comparisons to the lifestyles of @entity11 's high - profile business tycoons , the ' oligarchs '			1
one 53.7 - metre yacht with a designer interior , a spa pool , waterfall and wine cellar is relegated to second best , it said			0
' the real diamond of the @entity99 flotilla , ' the authors judged , is a five - decked yacht with a jacuzzi , barbecue , a maple wood colonnade and a huge bathroom faced in marble			0
the authors also identified from photographs a total of 11 luxury timepieces on the wrist of the head of state and calculated their total value at some £ 400,000 , while noting @entity8 had declared an annual income less than £ 700,000			1
the text was accompanied by photographs of luxurious homes , jets , helicopters , cars and watches , complete with footnotes citing @entity11 media as sources for many of the items			2
nine new residences had been added to the list available to the president since @entity8 first became head of state in 2000 , it said			1
homes he could retreat to across the country , ranged from seaside palaces to a ski lodge , and boasted everything from saunas and billiard rooms to a ' presidential church '			2
while not addressing @entity8 's personal wealth directly - the president once dismissed talk of him being a billionaire as ' snot ' from the noses of @entity161 reporters and smeared on paper - it challenged his self - portrayal as ' your humble servant ' to paint him as a callous , @entity166 - like figure ignoring the corruption and poverty that has hobbled the economy and blighted lives			1
lavish lifestyle : @entity8 has a pick of 20 palaces to spend time in - on the island in @entity176 there is a cinema , two restaurants and a bowling alley opulent time - keeping : the 32 page document , left , listed 11 watches which alone are worth several times @entity8 's annual salary it juxtaposed @entity8 's latest declared annual income and his account of owning only three old cars with a description of some of the 700 automobiles at the disposal of the presidential administration			1
the president has long denied rumors that he has built up a vast personal fortune			0
the report did not address that but it illustrated in 32 pages how the former @entity200 spy has expanded the trappings of office since he rose to power in 2000			0
despite a wave of massive protests this winter that followed @entity11 's fraud - tainted parliamentary and presidential votes , @entity8 remains popular among average @entity11 , largely thanks to government - controlled television networks that critics compare to @entity212 propaganda			2
high - flyer : the report listed 58 aircraft that @entity8 had access to , including a $ 75,000 toilet eye - watering : the president 's @entity60 airliner was reported to have cost $ 18m to be fitted out by jewellers and have a toilet that costs $ 75,000 the @entity99 , which has long portrayed the 59 - year - old president as a man of simple tastes with a liking for popular sports and active outdoor pastimes , did not immediately comment			1
intended to foster faint stirrings of opposition to @entity8 's recent re-election for a further six years , the report may struggle for attention			1
in a mark of the reluctance of @entity11 to challenge the @entity99 , @entity20 said he had struggled to find a printer willing to produce the booklet			0
and after publication , it was largely ignored by the country 's major media outlets			2
many ordinary @entity11 seemed indifferent to opponents who reveled in eye - catching details , such as the $ 75,000 toilet on a presidential jet			0
high maintenance : @entity20 estimated that the maintenance of @entity8 's residences , jets and cars alone costs £ 1.6 billion a year tales of extravagance in the leadership , though familiar to @entity11 throughout their history from tsars to commissars , come at a potentially awkward time for @entity8 after the biggest protests of his 12 - year rule , mostly from middle - class urban liberals who are now trying to fire up indignation more widely			1
' i hope that after this report the numbers of people believing that @entity8 and his allies are swindlers and thieves will approach 70 percent , ' @entity20 said , using the labels for the ruling elite which have become a slogan for the opposition			2
' after that , i think we will be able to free the country of them , ' he said at an event to launch the pamphlet			0
though @entity8 may have little leisure time @entity8 to enjoy the assets at his disposal , and he can point to fellow world leaders enjoying special transport and country retreats - such as the @entity288 president 's @entity286 and @entity289 - the report was scathing of the expense lavished on @entity99 facilities			2
speaking out : opposition leader @entity20 ( left ) speaks as he presents the report in @entity293 @entity20 , a deputy prime minister in the 1990s , has become one of @entity8 's fiercest critics and was among the leaders of a series of protests in the past nine months			1
but the president remains popular for bringing order after the chaos that followed the collapse of communism in 1991 , even if a recent opinion survey found a majority would prefer a new leader come 2018			0
but the responses of the likes of @entity293 pensioner @entity309 suggested it might be an uphill battle to turn any dismay over @entity8 's perks into a boost for the protest movement			1
' it 's obviously too much , way beyond what is needed to do the job , ' she said			2
' but of course that is no surprise to me			0
i 've lived here for 70 years			0
it 's always been like that			0
' among the young , too , many did not share @entity20 's anger : ' @entity11 authorities and leaders have always been famous for their rather luxurious ways			0
this is a historical pattern and he is not the first to live a fairly luxurious life , ' said @entity334 , a first - year university student in the capital			0
' personally , i do n't care , ' she said			0
' for me , how well he does his job is most important			0
' @entity8 's press service was not immediately available for comment but his spokesman had earlier words on the report			1
' all of this is government property and @entity8 uses it all legally as an elected president , ' @entity8 's spokesman @entity344 told the @entity348 daily yesterday after parts of the report had appeared online .			1

he has access to 20 palaces and villas , a fleet of 58 aircraft and 4 yachts
