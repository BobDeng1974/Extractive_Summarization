when it comes to those big nights out , less is definitely not more			2
you need to turn up the volume ( not just on your hair ) but on your whole look so you can stand out from the crowd			0
last week i had a big red - carpet event that i was attending with made in @entity10 colleague @entity9 , so we both popped down to @entity12 , the recently launched @entity14 hair salon that specialise in blow - drys and up - dos			1
for big night hair , getting someone else to do your blow - dry really helps to nail your look			1
most salons will happily do this for around £ 15 - £ 20 , but if you are working to a budget call a friend and get ready together			2
my hair was dried gently including the roots by @entity35 creative director @entity34 and he used @entity37 , but i ’ve not seen this product on - sale in shops , so my choice for home would be @entity43			2
massage this into the roots to give lift and volume , and tease in a good styling mousse for the main body of your hair that adds body – one of my favourites is @entity54 and @entity55			0
@entity34 then blow - dried my hair with a large round brush ( remember be careful not to damage your hair with too much heat ) and then put it in large @entity61 curlers in sections for about 15 minutes			1
@entity26 was joined by her pals @entity64 ( centre ) and @entity9 ( right ) @entity26 rocked a £ 500,000 ring and £ 50,000 bracelet to ensure she was looking red carpet chic he then used heated tongs on all sections , and back - combed , starting from the nape of the neck , sides and then into the sides and finally the top sections and then smoothed and styled			1
i normally use @entity77 – @entity79 and @entity80 , it does what is says on the tine and has super firm hold that lasts all night			2
@entity9 had curlers on the top section to give lift but then had the side sections blow - dried tight to the sides and back , and back - combed sections at the bottom by the nape of the neck to give lift at the back			1
it was a really sleek look and it requires quite a bit of @entity96 which created a glossy finish which had a real cutting - edge catwalk feel			2
@entity26 had her hair styled at the @entity12 on the @entity14 for my night out i was also lucky enough to have jeweller to the stars @entity102 – owner of top diamond retailer @entity104 – lend me some beautiful jewellery for the occasion			1
he adorned me with a pair of sophisticated 15 carat drop chandelier diamond earrings worth £ 50,000 , a dainty 25 carat diamond tennis bracelet worth £ 80,000 and a massive 60 carat @entity111 sapphire diamond ring worth a whopping £ 500,000 ! the stunning @entity104 jewellery complemented my outfit perfectly and made me feel like a million dollars ( quite literally ! )			0
@entity26 says it 's important to opt for a high quality lipstick in order to prevent bleeding and fade clearly i ca n’t afford to keep these jewels and on most occasions i wear some statement costume jewellery to add a bit of bling to the finished look			1
now on to the make - up			0
if you go big with the hair you really have to follow suit with the make - up			1
@entity130 : flash photography and the harsh lighting at big events can show up even the tiniest imperfections , so a flawless - looking complexion is essential			1
this fluid foundation melts into the skin to create a perfect complexion that should easily last for the whole evening			1
@entity140 @entity139 @entity141 : the secret to really luscious lashes is fresh mascara			0
as soon as it starts to dry out , it will become less effective , so i always invest in a brand new wand before a special night , and this is my current favourite			1
@entity155 , curling and lengthening your lashes , all in a single sweep of the brush , it gives you deliciously dark and smoky eyes without smudging , flaking or fading during the evening			0
@entity157 : for those of you who thought one lipstick is the same as another – well , think again			0
poor quality lip products can fade , slide or bleed mere minutes after you ’ve applied them			0
this @entity157 lip colour , however , really lasts , without drying out your pout like some long - hold lipsticks can			0
the formula boasts botanical waxes to nourish , pearl polymers to give intense colour and hold , and plant oils for shine and moisture			0
i chose a soft raspberry shade called @entity178 , and it kept my lips looking kissable right through to the final “ mwah ” ! @entity181 : for me , the final piece of the beauty puzzle is always a spritz of delicious perfume			0
this new fragrance from fashion designer @entity187 is strikingly sexy – just the thing to boost your confidence and make you feel irresistible as you arrive at a big event			0
featuring notes of vetiver , @entity191 rose , musk and amber , it is inspired by women ’s powers of seduction ! it certainly made me feel desirable , though with @entity9 at my side how could the boys resist			2
talk about devastating double act ! you ’ll find all the products i ’ve recommended at online beauty boutique @entity206			0
here ’s hoping your big night is as much fun as mine ! until next week , stay gorgeous love @entity26 xxx			1
