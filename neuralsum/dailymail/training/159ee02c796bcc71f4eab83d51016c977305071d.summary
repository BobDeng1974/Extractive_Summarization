head coach @entity12 was asked for a wave and captain @entity14 heard his name sung			0
during their previous @entity17 home match — a defeat by @entity19 — @entity12 was booed and @entity14 jeered			0
since then , however , @entity20 and @entity21 have been defeated and this rout , the club ’s biggest win since february 2012 , boosted the feelgood factor as much as their league position			0
true , @entity27 provided weak opposition but some of @entity1 ’s attacking play , spearheaded by @entity0 , suggested the good times can continue			1
@entity0 ( second right ) nods the ball home for @entity1 's second goal @entity0 slides the ball past @entity37 11 minutes into the second half to seal the victory for @entity1 @entity1 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity40 6.5 ; wisdom 7 , @entity42 7.5 , @entity43 7.5 , @entity44 7.5 ( @entity45 83min ) ; @entity46 6.5 ( @entity47 87 ) , @entity48 7 ; @entity49 7.5 , @entity50 7 ( @entity51 74 , 6 ) , @entity14 7.5 ; @entity0 8			1

this was the first time since november 2012 that @entity1 have recorded three consecutive victories in all competitions and they leapt from 17th place to 10th in one afternoon			1
@entity0 scored twice to become the leading @entity89 marksman in the top flight with four goals and back up his pre-match claim that to win senior international honours is not an unrealistic ambition			1
with @entity97 ’s assistant @entity96 and @entity99 coach @entity98 in the stands it is feasible the 21 - year - old could be given a call - up for next month ’s @entity104 qualifiers — particularly with @entity105 recovering from injury and @entity108 faltering			2
@entity99 manager @entity97 knows @entity0 from his time at @entity1			1
‘ if he keeps on playing like that he ’ll get all those rewards , ’ said @entity12			0
‘ i do n’t think @entity97 will be looking and saying he ’s too young but right now @entity0 has just got to keep working as he does			2
’ @entity0 , with eight goals in 11 games for @entity114 , nodded in from two yards on the stroke of half - time to make it 2 - 0 and then applied a precise finish 11 minutes after the interval			1
@entity42 had opened the scoring in the 31st minute and @entity49 grabbed the goal his performance deserved with a clinical shot in the final minute			1
‘ we wo n’t get carried away , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we will focus and go to @entity125 ( on saturday ) and make sure we get something there			0
’ for @entity27 the worry is they have added defensively fragility to their limited offensive capabilities			2
this was their fifth @entity17 game in a row without scoring , making it 526 minutes since @entity66 hit their only goal of the season against @entity138			2
three points had been accrued via goalless draws to give @entity78 ’s side the joint best defensive record in the division alongside @entity144 going into this match			0
but their resistance crumbled spectacularly here			0
‘ that ’s a massive learning curve , ’ said @entity78 , shorn of his usual midfield through injuries to @entity150 and @entity151			0
‘ we were carrying too many players today			0
’ @entity27 ’s poor scoring record must be a huge concern			0
‘ that needs to be dealt with , ’ he said			0
‘ players get that weird feeling , “ when are we going to score ? ” ‘ one of the big mantras i say to the players is , “ be the man who makes a difference ”			0
’ @entity42 snuffs out the danger of @entity27 's @entity67 and shepherds the ball out of play in the first couple of minutes @entity50 ( left ) passes the ball under pressure from former @entity1 midfielder @entity62 ( centre ) and @entity66 on - loan @entity1 defender @entity173 gets up ahead of @entity68 to win the ball in the air @entity42 ( left ) leaps above @entity27 defender @entity60 to give @entity1 the lead at the @entity11 @entity42 ( centre ) gets up and heads the ball back across goal past all the bodies and in for the game 's opener @entity1 midfielder @entity48 ( centre ) and @entity27 's @entity66 ( left ) battle for the ball as @entity50 takes a keen interest @entity49 slides in to challenge @entity27 full back @entity187 @entity27 's veteran centre half @entity59 gets to grip with @entity50 during the first half @entity12 stuck with the team that won 1 - 0 at @entity20 and it paid off			1
@entity42 got the ball rolling , scoring against the club who tried three times to buy him in the summer			2
the defender should be glad his transfer request was rejected			0
@entity42 rose higher than @entity60 to head in @entity14 ’s corner for his first @entity1 goal			1
@entity1 ’s second came from the same source , although this time @entity48 delivered the corner , @entity49 flicked on and @entity0 applied the final nod			1
then @entity0 got his second with a neat finish across @entity37 and though @entity27 tried to claw their way back into the game , @entity1 keeper @entity40 did well to save from @entity69			1
@entity1 supporters have taken to serenading their head coach with the chant , ‘ @entity211 ’ , and did so again as the football flowed			2
‘ i ’ve probably been called that a few times but not so much in that context , ’ said the @entity212 with a smile			0
he hopes the fans keep having cause to turn the air blue with joy			0
@entity0 ( second right ) looks at the ball as it nestles in the corner for @entity1 's second goal @entity0 ( second left ) is congratulated as @entity1 celebrate going 2 - 0 ahead @entity27 manager @entity78 looks inconsolable as his side go in 2 - 0 down in the first half at the @entity11 @entity0 strikes the ball with his golden boots and makes it 3 - 0 to the home side @entity0 slotted the ball past @entity37 for @entity1 's third goal ... for more go to our brilliant @entity232 @entity69 takes a ride on @entity42 's back but it was a frustrating afternoon for the @entity27 striker @entity49 ( left ) celebrates with @entity0 after scoring @entity1 's fourth goal at the @entity11			1

@entity42 headed @entity1 into the lead from a corner
@entity0 nodded in the second from close range on stroke of half - time
