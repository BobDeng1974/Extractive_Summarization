by @entity0 the first time it happened , i was eight years old and on the beach with my father and my best friend , @entity6			1
@entity7 suggested a running race , drawing the start line with a piece of wood in the sand			2
‘ ready , steady ... ’ and @entity6 was off			2
my fury at her getting an unjust lead was only fuelled by my father cheering her on , blithely ignoring the fact that she had so blatantly cheated			1
she won , of course			2
and i ’ll never forget him saying ‘ it ’s because she ’s taller than you			2
she ’s a better runner			2
’ prince charming : @entity0 ( right ) pictured with her @entity25 and @entity7 , who would flatter @entity0 's friends and bowl them over with his charisma @entity6 threw me a look — one that clearly said : ‘ i ’ve got your dad wrapped round my little finger			1
’ and so she had			2
it was a fact of my life ; something that happened whenever i invited a friend round			1
to say that my father , a great raconteur , put on a show for my female friends would be an understatement			1
from the moment they stepped over the threshold he would turn on the charm , directing all his wit and humour in their direction			1
usually it was me who basked in the glow of his unfailing good nature and i knew how special it made me feel			2
dormant emotions : her father 's actions made @entity0 so mad that she has only recently acknowledged them again but when friends came over , his spotlight beamed on them			1
i ’m not suggesting that his behaviour was inappropriate			2
he was n’t flirting at this stage			1
it was more a desire for some sort of adulation from my peers			2
he would flatter them and bowl them over with his unarguable charisma			0
it drove me absolutely mad			0
so mad , in fact , that it has only taken a recent article in society magazine @entity76 to bring all those dormant emotions flooding back three decades on			0
in a feature entitled ‘ @entity81 ’ , the magazine ’s teen supplement blatantly encourages girls as young as 13 to flirt with their friends ’ fathers , telling them that ‘ the big secret to getting on in life ’ is to make other people ’s parents like you			1
the article advises its young readers to ‘ take half an hour to flirt ( gently ) with the parent of the opposite sex and then write a witty thank - you letter — bingo , you ’re a winner ’			1
it continues : ‘ @entity97 will get out and you ’ll be invited everywhere — dinners , more country weekends , swanky holidays and so on , and so on … ’ my family did n’t own a country pile or jet off on expensive holidays			0
but that did n’t stop my friends simpering at my father whenever he happened to stroll into a room			1
and the older we got , the worse it became			1
he did n’t need any encouragement and neither , it seemed , did they			0
how i wished he would just go away and leave us all alone like other dads did			0
and , to my horror , my friends were always more than keen to stop talking to me about @entity119 or @entity120 and turn their attention to whatever my father wanted to bore them with — usually , tales of his brief film career ( he was a bit - part actor in the @entity125 ) or some other equally tedious anecdote from his past			1
what girl wants her father stealing the limelight ? and why could n’t my friends at least look a little bored ? stealing the limelight : @entity0 felt uncomfortable with the attention her friends gave her father there were other emotions , too , that i could n’t fully understand			1
one of the ways @entity7 would try to impress my friends was by belittling me , making me the butt of his jokes			1
it was always done with a smile and i ’m sure was n’t intended to hurt me			0
the result , however , was that he would make my friends howl with laughter			1
suddenly , it was them against me and they were n’t yet mature enough to put peer loyalty above trying to impress a parent			0
perhaps i was just over-sensitive , but i grew to hate the banter			0
admittedly it made me feel a little jealous but also slightly uncomfortable , as if i were a gooseberry on my own play dates			0
by the time i was 17 , my father had turned to open flirtation with one of my more attractive schoolfriends			1
why , i have no idea			0
at the time , his marriage to my mother seemed happy ; perhaps he thought it was funny			1
at any rate , i found it excruciating and so spent a lot of time at my friend ’s house instead , where her father largely ignored us			1
yet i could n’t keep my friends and my father apart for ever			1
and to my horror , when i was 18 a pal of mine took a shine to my dad			1
my parents had recently separated — a decision prompted largely by my mother , who moved out of our five - bedroom home into a one - bedroom flat in a nearby @entity177 village			1
they were having a rough patch and , looking back , i suspect she was hoping my father would beg her to return			2
what he did , however , was mope around feeling understandably sorry for himself			0
i was home after dropping out of my first year of university and landed myself a junior writer ’s job on the local paper , where i befriended an outgoing redhead called @entity189			1
we had been at the same school , but she was in the year above me , so until then we had n’t had much to do with each other			0
that changed as we bonded over tedious council meetings and my frustrations at the sorry demise of my parents ’ marriage as i watched @entity7 rattling around our home , sorrowfully griddling fish fingers for himself every night			2
forgiveness : although things improved between @entity0 and her @entity7 , she was never able to forgive her friend @entity189 then one night she ended up staying over			1
i can remember , in the morning , standing on the landing , hearing my @entity7 tell her a joke in the kitchen — the first time i ’d heard him laugh in months			2
and then glancing towards my parents ’ bedroom , its door wide open , duvet askew , the bed clearly slept in on both sides			0
the door to the spare bedroom , where @entity189 should have spent the night , was firmly shut			1
who , i remember wondering , shuts a bedroom door when coming out of it in the morning ? i knew that all it would take was for me to turn the handle and look			2
then i would see the smooth eiderdown my mother had bought at a craft fair			0
a bed carefully made up for a friend , but a bed i was convinced had not been slept in			2
in that moment i hated both of them			0
her for betraying our friendship , and him for crossing a line that i never in a million years thought he would dare to cross			0
during the next few days i confronted both of them and they vehemently denied anything had happened			0
it was only when i popped out one lunchtime to buy my father a birthday present — a new radio alarm clock for his bedside table — and @entity189 said : ‘ has his other one broken ? ’ that the truth finally came out			1
the look of horror on her face at this slip would almost have been funny if i had n’t felt so shocked			0
to her credit , she did apologise and tried to explain that it was a moment of madness — a one - night stand she deeply regretted			0
but i felt they had both acted with complete disregard for my feelings , then treated me like an idiot by lying about what had happened			0
part of me felt vindicated — i ’d had suspicions all along			0
but i could n’t get over this overwhelming sense i ’d been let down in the worst possible way			0
it was supposed to be @entity189 and me sharing secrets , not @entity189 and my father			1
i tried to continue living with @entity7 and to see things from his point of view			0
he was having a crisis , fair enough			0
but he never once said sorry			0
eventually , things just became too difficult at home and i decided to move out and rent a room in a house with people my own age			2
i still saw @entity189 at work , but we no longer socialised			1
i just could n’t get over the image of her having sex with my dad			1
daughters of her own : because of her experiences @entity0 is more aware how her own husband acts around her teenage daughters ' friends ( @entity0 's dad pictured with one of @entity0 's daughters , then aged two ) of course , we were all adults by this stage and you might argue that i had no good reason to feel so wronged			1
yet it is still hard to explain how devastated i felt			0
things with my @entity7 did , eventually , improve — you ca n’t choose your family , after all			0
but i chose to avoid @entity189 and have n’t spoken to her for years			1
now i have two teenage daughters of my own and i suppose it ’s natural that i am more aware of how my husband , @entity304 , behaves around their friends			2
thankfully , he pays very little attention			0
i ’m sure they view him as middle - aged and dull			0
which is as it should be			0
i hope teenage girls will take @entity76 ’s terrible advice with a pinch of salt — not just because hair - flicking and batting one ’s eyes at a friend ’s father is deeply uncool , but because even if your friend looks as if she does n’t care , it will matter to her very much indeed			1
trust me , i should know .			0

@entity0 's dad would turn on the charm when her friends came round
