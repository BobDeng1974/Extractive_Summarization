@entity0 , pictured , has been compared to @entity1 by a senior @entity3 manager in advance of a probe into the latest @entity7 incident the @entity3 launched an astonishing attack on @entity0 yesterday , comparing him to sex offender @entity1 and urging him to check into rehab			1
blaming the now notorious ‘ fracas ’ with a @entity7 producer on ‘ personal issues ’ , one of the most senior @entity16 executives said @entity0 was ‘ self - destructing ’ and needed help			1
most controversially , the tv chief , who has been directly involved in the fallout from the incident , likened @entity0 ’s supporters – including the prime minister – to those who turned a blind eye to @entity1 ’s appalling crimes			1
last night , friends of the 54 - year - old presenter expressed disbelief that the @entity3 should make such explosive claims before its internal investigation into the controversy has even begun			0
‘ i am in total shock that someone at the @entity3 would attack their own talent and deliberately smear @entity0 , ’ said @entity31 , who was @entity7 ’s mysterious test driver @entity33			1
the broadside came as further details of the alleged assault on producer @entity40 emerged			2
one report claimed @entity0 split @entity40 ’s lip with a punch , leaving him needing hospital treatment			1
other sources told this newspaper that @entity0 had not been drinking – and that the row was not entirely about the lack of a hot meal at the end of a day ’s filming			1
but the most astonishing development came during a wide - ranging official briefing given to @entity54 by a senior @entity3 figure			2
the executive likened 36 - year - old @entity40 ’s position to that of @entity1 ’s victims , who feared they would not be believed while he was alive			0
‘ the pressure this guy [ @entity40 ] is under is so @entity65 in a way , ’ he said , adding that @entity0 ’s support from high - level politicians recalled the way @entity1 was once defended			1
‘ if you look at what @entity68 says or what [ former culture and media secretary ] @entity71 says and you swap @entity0 for @entity1 , you get this : @entity68 is effectively saying that @entity1 ’s a real talent , @entity71 saying @entity1 will be @entity1			1
’ the comparison will inevitably anger @entity76 ’s victims			1
conservative mp @entity77 , who sits on the @entity78 , said that ‘ it is not just patently absurd , it ’s also deeply offensive to @entity0 and those innocent people who were horribly abused by @entity1 ’			1
the @entity3 executive also said that attempts to suggest the ‘ fracas ’ was part of a wider battle between @entity0 and @entity87 , the @entity3 ’s powerful director of television , were misleading			1
@entity0 is said to have a difficult relationship with @entity87 , who told him that he was on a final warning after a string of controversies			1
‘ people keep saying that this is a case of @entity87 v @entity0			1
it is not , ’ said the executive			0
‘ this is @entity0 v @entity0 … ‘ @entity0 is self - destructing			1
@entity87 is not the person who is driving this , it is @entity0			1
’ referring to the @entity7 host ’s much - publicised split from his wife @entity105 after 21 years , the @entity3 chief added : ‘ it is common knowledge he has personal issues ; we have all read about them			1
‘ if i was advising him i would take one of two options			0
do what he is doing now and continue to try to play it down – or i would go into rehab and show the world i am trying to change			0
‘ the @entity3 has stood by him before when he has been in hot water … but this is more serious			0
’ @entity3 director of television @entity87 , pictured , is said to have a difficult relationship with @entity0 the @entity3 producer involved in the ' fracas ' with @entity0 is privately terrified he is going to lose his job , sources claimed			1
@entity40 has been working on the @entity7 franchise in various roles since 2005 and has also been an assistant producer on @entity128 ’s @entity127			1
but the 36 - year - old has been in hiding all week , when it emerged he had been punched by the presenter			0
one insider close to his legal team at @entity134 and @entity135 described @entity40 as ‘ mortified ’			0
' he is terrified that he might lose the job he loves and has been doing for the past six years			0
all he wants to do is to get back to work , ' they told the @entity139			0
' he is mortified by the whole thing			0
' @entity3 sources have claimed that @entity7 would survive without @entity0 as other shows – including @entity143 – have coped with the loss of a much - loved presenter			1
they added about @entity40 : ' we would hope he will continue to be employed by the @entity3 after this matter is resolved			0
' @entity0 is being represented by law firm @entity148 , which refused to comment			1
as the row intensified , sources in the @entity0 camp gave @entity54 what they say is the most definitive account yet of the events leading to the hotel incident			1
contrary to what has been widely reported , they insisted the presenter had not been drinking beforehand – although co-presenter @entity158 downed a bottle of white wine			0
neither did @entity0 explode with anger at the hotel just because he could n’t have an expensive steak			1
‘ yes , it is true that there was no supper but he was angry because they did n’t have enough producers during the day and it made filming extremely difficult , ’ said one source			0
others close to the star – who has been suspended by the @entity3 – accurately predicted the @entity16 would cast him as a man careering ‘ off the rails ’			0
even so , the depth of the attack , and the personal nature of the comments , will surprise many – especially as , until now , the @entity16 has been careful to limit its comments ahead of the inquiry			0
the executive ’s comments drew a furious reaction from @entity0 supporters			1
@entity31 added : ‘ this will be a nightmare for @entity0 and he will feel deeply concerned that someone at @entity16 has spoken his name in the same sentence as that disgusting creature @entity1			1
‘ it is ill - conceived , as was the decision to suspend him and take @entity7 off the air			2
@entity0 is a brilliant broadcaster and a fantastic guy			2
‘ it ’s atrocious that these idiots at the @entity3 are paid so much money but run it about as well as a three - year - old child			0
’ @entity0 is accused of punching tv producer @entity40 , pictured , after a day 's filming in @entity200 @entity0 , may and @entity201 had been filming in @entity202 all day before the incident			1
they left at just after 6pm for a two - and - half - hour helicopter flight to the luxury @entity208 hotel in the @entity209			0
on board , may drank a bottle of wine , but @entity0 drank nothing as he had to work on a script later that evening			2
a senior @entity3 source has reportedly told people that @entity0 's much publicised split from his wife @entity105 , left , could be behind his melt - down filming had been fraught because of the shortage of producers and @entity0 was tired , annoyed and hungry , having had nothing to eat all day , the sources say			1
and it was against this background , that they arrived at the hotel to be told there was no hot supper			0
what happened next will have to be established by the @entity3 ’s inquiry			0
it is not thought that @entity0 will dispute ranting at @entity233			2
but he is already said to deny calling him a ‘ lazy @entity234 * * * * ’			0
one account will claim the presenter went nose - to - nose with @entity40 and said : ‘ you ’ll be on the dole tomorrow			0
‘ i ’m going to make sure you will not have a job			0
’ the executive who briefed @entity54 said : ‘ [ @entity40 ] could be in hospital because of this			1
‘ he is watching it all play out			0
@entity0 is a bit more used to it			2
i do n’t think @entity0 has got the most to lose			2
‘ he has got the money to see him out through his days if he needs to			0
the other guy [ @entity40 ] is just a jobbing producer			1
’ insiders say the @entity3 – which holds the rights to the lucrative @entity7 format – is prepared to continue making the show even if it means getting a new presenter or presenters			2
they say other shows , such as have i got news for you , survived the departure of a host and there was no reason @entity7 could not do the same			2
sources said the @entity3 remained the best place for a fearless motoring programme , because it was not beholden to advertisers			0
yesterday @entity0 looked downcast as he left his @entity268 apartment			2
he declined to comment but told journalists : ‘ you must be freezing			0
’ the @entity3 claims that @entity7 will survive if @entity0 , pictured , is no longer involved in the show the @entity3 disciplinary panel will be led by @entity273 , the head of @entity274 , who carried out the investigation into @entity277 ’s false exposé of @entity278			1
@entity0 started the disciplinary process himself when he told his bosses at the @entity3 about the row			2
meanwhile , a petition to reinstate @entity0 has gathered more than 920,000 signatures			2
the prime minister appeared to lend his support when he described @entity0 as a ‘ friend ’ and ‘ huge talent ’ , adding that he hoped the situation could be resolved so his children would not be left ‘ heartbroken ’			2
@entity0 is scheduled to appear alongside may and @entity201 at four live shows in @entity291 later this month			2
all three presenters ’ contracts expire three days after the @entity291 gigs			0
the last three episodes of the series have been put on hold			0
tonight ’s show has been replaced with a documentary about the @entity300 .			0

a senior @entity303 executive has launched an attack on @entity0
the executive said : ' @entity0 's self destructing **...** and should go into rehab '

they added : ' the pressure on [ @entity7 producer ] is @entity65 '
