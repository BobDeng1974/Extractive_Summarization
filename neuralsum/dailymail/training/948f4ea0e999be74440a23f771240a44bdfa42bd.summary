children around the world have been recreating the nativity in countless school plays during the build up to @entity5			0
but they may have to get rid of the cardboard donkeys and straw - covered floor next year if a theologian 's claims are true			2
minister and academic reverend @entity11 insists @entity12 was not born in a stable , but in a busy room in a family home			1
the @entity29 word ' kataluma ' , he says , was wrongly translated as ' inn '			2
in fact , he claims , the word means ' private room ' or ' lodging '			2
he says the misunderstanding wrongly suggested @entity41 and @entity42 were turned away from a hostel - like building , instead of , as he claims , being put up in communal area in the family home because there was no room just for them			1
in @entity53 's interpretation of the @entity55 story , @entity42 , returning to @entity51 , would have been received by distant relatives			1
because his relations ' guest room was already full , the family would have stayed in the main family room , where @entity12 was born , @entity53 says			1
the traditional view of @entity12 's birth surrounded by donkeys and cows has been recreated countless times but @entity65 says the idea came from a mistranslation which made it sound like @entity41 and @entity42 were turned away from an inn , so had to settle for a stable the @entity11 wrote on his blog : ' what does it mean for the kataluma to have " no space " ? ' it means that many , like @entity42 and @entity41 , have travelled to @entity51 , and the family guest room is already full , probably with other relatives who arrived earlier			1
' so @entity42 and @entity41 must stay with the family itself , in the main room of the house , and there @entity41 gives birth			1
' research by @entity85 released today found that 65 per cent of the @entity87 public believe @entity12 lived			0
but a majority of people , 55 per cent , think that @entity12 was not born to a virgin mother , compared to 24 per cent who think he was			1
the most widely believed detail of the @entity5 story is that the new born baby @entity12 was laid in a manger , which 47 per cent of people believe to be true compared to just 29 per cent who do not			2
the survey revealed just 37 per cent believe that the three wise men were guided by a star and brought gifts and 28 per cent believe an angel of the @entity103 appeared to the shepherds			0
he says the layout of homes at the time meant that animals were fed in manger - type arrangements at the edge of the family room			1
he added : ' the most natural place to lay the baby is in the straw - filled depressions at the lower end of the house where the animals are fed. ' the idea that they were in a stable , away from others , alone and outcast , is grammatically and culturally implausible			0
in fact , it is hard to be alone at all in such contexts			0
' @entity53 , an honorary assistant professor at the @entity127 , says the mistranslation is important , not just for children 's plays , but because it can change the way the story is interpreted			0
he added : ' in the @entity5 story , @entity12 is not sad and lonely , some distance away in the stable , needing our sympathy			2
' he is in the midst of the family , and all the visiting relations , right in the thick of it and demanding our attention			0
this should fundamentally change our approach to enacting and preaching on the nativity			0
' father - of - four @entity53 initially trained in maths at @entity146 and worked in business for @entity149 chocolate before training for ordination			0
@entity53 says it is inconceivable that @entity152 in the time of @entity12 would have allowed the family to stay in an out - building @entity156 2 : 4 - 8 ( @entity157 ) 4 so @entity42 also went up from the town of @entity159 in @entity160 to @entity161 , to @entity51 the town of @entity163 , because he belonged to the house and line of @entity163			1
5 he went there to register with @entity41 , who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child			0
6 while they were there , the time came for the baby to be born , 7 and she gave birth to her firstborn , a son			0
she wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger , because there was no guest room available for them .			1

@entity12 traditionally seen as having been born in a stable next to animals
but scholar says that is a myth born out of a mistranslation of @entity29
he says @entity42 's distant relations would have put family up for the night
the @entity55 actually claims there was no guest room for them , he says
instead , they would have stayed in a family room , where @entity12 was born
