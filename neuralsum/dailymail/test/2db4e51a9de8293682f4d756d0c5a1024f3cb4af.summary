lovingly tended gardens with their manicured lawns and neat flowerbeds were once the very essence of @entity4			0
but these days we are increasingly using outdoor space for the occasional barbecue or to relax in a hot tub rather than for tending flowers , according to researchers			1
as a result , only a handful of traditional flowers still grow in @entity15 country gardens , with the average one usually containing a mere four species – daffodils , crocuses , roses and tulips			1
these days we are increasingly using outdoor space for the occasional barbecue or to relax in a hot tub rather than for tending flowers , according to researchers ( file image ) almost 40 per cent of people , including 66 per cent of those aged 18 - 29 , spend more time sunbathing and having barbecues in their garden than tending it , according to the survey of 1,000 adults by the garden furniture retailer @entity32			1
sir @entity33 , the landscape designer and former director of the @entity35 , told the @entity36 : ‘ @entity38 people used to take pride in having neat gardens with lots of flowers			2
‘ now they are watching lots of gardening shows on television but doing less gardening themselves			0
’ typical of the trend is @entity47 , a 31 - year - old council officer from @entity48 , @entity49 , who said : ‘ the main purpose of our garden is as a space to unwind with a glass of wine on a warm evening after work			2

a survey of 2,000 homeowners carried out for @entity83 found that 10 per cent of respondents owned a hot tub , with the equipment in the average @entity38 garden now worth £ 1,928			0

only traditional flowers still grow in @entity15 country gardens as a result
most only contains four species - daffodils , crocuses , roses and tulips
