it is the perfect invention for the house proud - a substance that means clothes will never stain , glass will not mist and kitchen surfaces automatically shed their germs			1
scientists in @entity9 have developed a ‘ self - cleaning ’ coating that can be sprayed or painted onto almost any material			0
the substance , made out of coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles , works because it is very , very water resistant			1
scientists in @entity9 have developed a ‘ self - cleaning ’ coating that can be sprayed or painted onto almost any material			0
the substance is made out of coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles and any drop of moisture which touches it turns into a ball and rolls away , cleaning up any dust or germs in its path any drop of moisture which touches it turns into a ball and rolls away , cleaning up any dust or germs in its path			1
the breakthrough , by chemists at @entity30 , comes after years of research into highly water - resistant - or ‘ superhydrophobic ’ - substances			1
the idea was inspired by copying elements from nature			2
@entity38 feathers , for example , repel water , keeping a bird afloat and its plumage clean			1
the petals of a lotus flower , in a similar way , shed moisture , meaning they are not weighed down and damaged by rain			2
within weeks of after @entity48 releasing its waterproof @entity49 last year , @entity47 filed a patent that took its rival ’s technology a step further			0
called ‘ methods for shielding electronic components from moisture ’ , the filing awarded today describes a way of making the inside of a phone waterproof rather than the outside			2
individual components would be covered in a thin film designed to stop liquids damaging the phone , even if it manages to penetrate the outer casing			0
professor @entity67 , head of chemistry at @entity30 , said : ‘ if we can do this as well as nature does it , we will have a series of breakthrough products			1
’ applications for the spray might include self - cleaning paint , which is resistant to coffee spills , damp or mould			0
the substance may also be used in hospital theatres to stop bacteria accumulating			2
or it might be used on the hulls of boats , reducing friction with the water , allowing more speed and requiring less fuel			0
professor @entity67 , whose work is published in the journal @entity93 , added : ‘ if it goes well you might see products on shop shelves in the order of two to four years			0
’ phd student @entity99 , whose lab work at @entity30 contributed to the breakthrough , has shown in a series of tests that the substance can be applied to the threads of textiles which could allow it to be used to create waterproof and stainproof clothes			1
mr @entity99 demonstrated that cotton - wool coated with the substance could be dipped into blue coloured dye and yet emerge pristine white			1
crucially , the student and his colleagues managed to develop a material that is far more robust than previous ‘ self - cleaning ’ substances			0
the experts demonstrated that cotton - wool coated with the substance could be dipped into blue coloured dye and yet emerge pristine white ( pictured )			1
in addition , the coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles are so tough that they survived being rubbed 40 times with sandpaper the idea was inspired by copying elements from nature			1
@entity38 feathers , for example , repel water , keeping a bird afloat and its plumage clean			1
the petals of a lotus flower , in a similar way , shed moisture meaning they are not weighed down and damaged by rain ( pictured ) previous attempts have failed because the coating could be wiped off with a napkin			2
but coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles are so tough that they survived being rubbed 40 times with sandpaper			1
mr @entity99 said : ‘ being waterproof allows materials to self - clean as water forms marble - shaped droplets that roll over the surface , acting like miniature vacuum cleaners picking up dirt , viruses and bacteria along the way			1
‘ for this to happen , the surface must be rough and waxy , so we set out to create these conditions on hard and soft surfaces by designing our own paint and combining it with different adhesives to help the surfaces withstand damage			2
’ professor @entity156 , co-author of the work , said : ‘ the biggest challenge for the widespread application of self - cleaning surfaces is finding a way to make them tough enough to withstand everyday damage			0
‘ the surfaces tend to be mechanically weak and so rub off easily , but by pairing our paint with different adhesives , we ’ve shown it is possible to make a robust self - cleaning surface			0
‘ we used materials that are readily available so our methods can be scaled - up for industrial applications			0
’ @entity173 researchers in @entity174 recently created a technique to make any surface super-waterproof by adding tiny structures to the surface instead			0
this causes droplets to bounce ( pictured ) , rather than roll , off			0
researchers claim it could be used to make solar panels , ships and planes waterproof			0

the substance is made out of coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles
any drop of moisture that touches it turns into a ball and rolls away
as it rolls off the surface it takes dust , dirt and germs with it
the breakthrough was made by chemists at @entity30
it was inspired by the way feathers keep birds afloat and plumage clean
