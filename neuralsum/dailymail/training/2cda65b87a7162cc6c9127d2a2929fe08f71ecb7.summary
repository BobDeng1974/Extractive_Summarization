by @entity0 and @entity1 ' it frightens me ' : @entity4 , who was born with severe spinal muscular atrophy , made a moving intervention against assisted dying yesterday @entity4 , who has battled a degenerative disease for half a century , made a moving intervention against assisted dying yesterday , saying : ' this offers no comfort to me - it frightens me			1
' the @entity4 of @entity12 was addressing a marathon 10 - hour debate in the @entity14 on whether terminally ill patients should be helped to die if they wish			1
breathing through a ventilator , she said @entity18 's @entity17 was aimed at her whether she wanted it or not , saying : ' i did not ask it and i do not want it , but it is about me nevertheless			1
' @entity4 , who was born with severe spinal muscular atrophy , said that in moments of despair , she might be tempted to ask for assisted dying - and if the law changed , doctors would not stop her			1
she told peers : ' it frightens me because in periods of greatest difficulty i know i might be tempted to use it			1
it only adds to the burdens and challenges life holds for me			1
' lord @entity18 , a long - term campaigner for the right to die , has proposed that people with less than six months to live be allowed to kill themselves with a lethal dose of drugs prepared – but not administered – by a doctor			1
he said his proposed law contained enough safeguards to prevent abuses and would be used in ‘ limited ’ circumstances to alleviate terrible suffering			2
it is completely different from the euthanasia laws in @entity48 and @entity49 which he rejects , he said			0
a patient would only be allowed to take their own life if they are judged to have the mental capacity to make the choice – and after an examination by two doctors			2
the law excludes those , like @entity4 , who are not deemed terminally ill , according to the @entity61			1
' do your lordships think that i would be refused ? you can be sure that there would be doctors and lawyers willing to support my right to die			0
' a record 130 peers put their names down to speak at the @entity84 ’s second reading			1
on both sides of the debate , peers told of the appalling suffering of loved ones			1
@entity90 , whose wife was left paralysed by an @entity93 bomb , made a an impassioned warning against assisted dying , saying ‘ the road to hell is paved with good intentions ’			0
‘ many people , caring so much for those they leave behind , are dying earlier and alone because they fear implicating their loved ones in a criminal enterprise			2
they hoard pills or put a plastic bag over their head when they are alone			0
it is time for a change in the law			0
’ lord @entity18 , who proposed the @entity17 ‘ when suffering is so great , when patients know they are at the end of life , make repeated pleas to die , it seems a denial of loving compassion which is the hallmark of @entity117 to refuse to fulfil their own clearly stated request			1
’ @entity136 , former archbishop of canterbury ‘ i get very angry when those who oppose the @entity84 misrepresent what it is actually proposing and fail to mention how limited its aims intentionally are			2
it applies only to those who are already terminally ill yet still in sound mind who want , as we all surely do , some control or say in the manner of their own death			2
it has nothing to do with coercing vulnerable old people into killing themselves			0
’ @entity138 peer lord @entity137 ‘ the @entity17 would provide a route to great savings in public and private expenditure , and to a great pressure on the elderly , the sick and the disabled to do the decent thing and cease to be a burden on others			2
those who care for such people are all too familiar with the moments of black despair that prompt those words , “ i would be better dead , so that you could get on with your life ”			1
’ @entity90 , former cabinet minister whose wife was left paralysed by the @entity163 bomb ‘ this @entity17 has broad categories into which anyone can be shoe - horned and it comes within a whisker of full - blown euthanasia			1
are there safeguards ? no , there are only broad categories into which you will find some doctor who would state that almost anyone fits			0
’ @entity169 of @entity170 , former president of the @entity171 ‘ it frightens me because in periods of greatest difficulty i know i might be tempted to use it			0
it only adds to the burdens and challenges life holds for me			1
’ @entity4 of @entity12 since his wife @entity180 was seriously injured by the @entity163 bomb in 1984 , the @entity179 former cabinet minister said he had come to know the ‘ moments of black despair which prompt those words : “ i would be better dead so that you could get on with your life ”			1
’ but he implored fellow peers not to change the law , as he feared it would be a ‘ breeding ground for vultures ’ seeking to profit from the deaths of frail elderly relatives			0
he described the case of an elderly lady he spoke to who said she wished to leave her assets to charity , as she had no children , but feared her family would find a way to claim them			0
plea : @entity90 and his wife @entity180 who was left paralysed by the @entity163 bombing in 1984 ‘ “ you see ” , she said , “ i have no children but i have several vultures awaiting my death ”			0
this @entity17 will be a breeding ground for vultures , individual and corporate			2
it creates too much financial incentive for the taking of life			0
’ the model @entity18 has followed is that introduced in the @entity214 state of @entity215 , which he said was only used 80 times last year			2
but opponent @entity218 , the @entity219 gold - medallist , said that as @entity215 has only 3million people , if the same trend was replicated in the @entity222 some 1,600 people a year could take their own lives in doctors ’ surgeries or @entity228 - style clinics			2
many raised concerns about whether the agreement of two doctors would really be sought			0
@entity90 highlighted the disclosure last year that doctors were secretly authorising abortions on grounds of sex selection , by pre-signing forms for women they had never met			0
@entity169 of @entity170 , former president of the @entity241 , warned that fellow gps had counter-signed the 176 cremation forms for patients murdered by @entity245			0
@entity18 ’s @entity17 will be scrutinised by a committee later in the year			1
although it puts the highly - charged issue back on the political agenda , it is unlikely to proceed further			0
the @entity250 reported last week how a @entity252 academic who used to support euthanasia warned the @entity222 not to adopt assisted dying			0
@entity256 said : ‘ once the genie is out of the bottle , it is not likely ever to go back in again			0
’ campaigner : lord @entity18 ( pictured ) , a long - term campaigner for the right to die , has proposed that terminally - ill people be allowed to kill themselves with a lethal dose of drugs prepared by a doctor			1

@entity4 of @entity12 said @entity18 's @entity17 ' frightened ' her
@entity267 has battled severe spinal muscular atrophy since for half a century
claimed that in moments of despair , she might be tempted to ask to die
' it only adds to the burdens and challenges life holds for me , ' she said
@entity84 proposes terminally - ill people should be allowed to kill themselves
they would do so with lethal dose of drugs formerly prepared by doctor
during 10 - hour debate , peers on both sides told of suffering of loved ones
