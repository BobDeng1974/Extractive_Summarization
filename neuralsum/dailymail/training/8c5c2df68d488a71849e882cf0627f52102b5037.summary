by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor a senior @entity3 mp today launched a devastating attack on party leader @entity6 ’s faltering leadership			1
former minister @entity7 broke ranks to accuse his leader of failing to set the agenda and raised serious doubts about the party 's hopes of winning the general election			1
he added that he had no idea what @entity3 ’s policy was on vote - winning areas including , education , welfare and the @entity21			2
trouble at the top : labour leader @entity6 is under pressure to make a bigger impact mr @entity7 ’s decision to speak out publicly echoes growing private concerns at senior levels of the party that @entity3 is failing to make an impact on voters			1
in one poll this week @entity3 was just three points ahead of the @entity33 , a lead which mr @entity7 might not ‘ withstand ’ a major battle during the general election campaign			1
questions have also been raised about why the party has failed to capitalise on @entity38 and @entity39 going on holiday at the start of the summer recess			2
in a devastating interview mr @entity7 said he was ‘ deeply worried ’ about the @entity45 's prospects at the general election , admitting that he did not know its policy on welfare or education			1
mr @entity7 , who was one of the first mps to call for @entity52 to quit , said mr @entity6 is ' always cocooned ' by people around him and suffers from a ' bunker mentality '			1
he also suffered from being ' young ' , the battle to defeat his brother @entity56 in the leadership election and the influence of trade unions			0
the former education minister told @entity61 ’s @entity62 : ‘ i have difficulty knowing what we stand for now			0
‘ we are 18 months away from an election thinking that we will put out a document on all these major items and the public will say “ oh great ”			0
‘ at the moment , the government are setting the agenda , making the weather and we 're responding to it			0
’ he warned the last two @entity3 leaders did a better job of dominating the political landscape			0
‘ @entity52 and @entity77 never did that ... we 're not setting any agenda , we 're responding to the @entity33			1
’ mr @entity7 , a close ally of mr @entity77 , said to get back into power labour had to ‘ demonstrate to people that we are relevant to their lives ’			2
if the party was not ‘ offering something different ’ people would ‘ stick with what they have got ’ , he warned			2
‘ there has to be and there is some concern that the lead we have in the polls , first of all is not firm enough , big enough , ’ he added			0
‘ will it withstand a general election discussion ? worried : @entity3 mp @entity7 attacked mr @entity6 's for the party 's confused stance on key issues ‘ but the real thing is , do you know , because i do n't , know our position on welfare , do you know our position on education , do you know our genuine position on how we 'd run the health service ? ‘ if you 're not getting a clear enough message to me , and to some of my colleagues , what are you , what kind of message do you think you 're putting out there ? ‘ i remember before we won , 1992 , the five years to 1997 , this place was bubbling , we were energetic , we were at them , we thought we had all the answers			1
‘ we 're not at them and we 're slightly hesitant and we 're slightly confused and i deeply worry about that			0
’ @entity122 , @entity3 's shadow justice secretary , hit back insiting mr @entity6 had been doing ' heavy lifting ' to prepare for government			1
he told the @entity61 : ' we have n’t got the luxury that @entity7 had between ’ 92 and ’ 97 of being out of power for 18 years			2
' that means learning the lessons , but doing the heavy lifting			0
and what you ’re right to remind me of , is in two and a half years , as a new leader - you ’re not the prime minister - you need to make an impression on the @entity137 public pretty swiftly			0
' and that ’s what we ’re seeking to do by setting the agenda			0
' but @entity142 chairman @entity141 said : ‘ this is all starting to sound very familiar			0
‘ @entity6 offers weak and directionless leadership to an increasingly restless @entity3			2
‘ if he is too weak to control his own party or stand - up to union barons , how can he possibly stand - up for the hardworking people of @entity137 ? as the senior and respected @entity3 mp @entity7 says himself , ‘ why would you vote @entity3 ? ” ’			1

*ex-minister* @entity7 says no - one knows what the party 's policies are
@entity6 is ' cocooned ' by cronies and failing to take the fight to the @entity33
