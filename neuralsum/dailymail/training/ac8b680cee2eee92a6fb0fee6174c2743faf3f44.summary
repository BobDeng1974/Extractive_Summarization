close encounter : prince @entity1 with 17 - year - old @entity2 in 2001 soon the murky affair of prince @entity1 and @entity2 will face scrutiny via a series of sensational cases due to come before the @entity8 courts			1
but as the scandal escalates , here are ten questions the @entity12 must address … 1 you have denied that prince @entity1 had ‘ any kind of sexual relationship or contact with @entity2 ’			1
he certainly did meet her , however : a photograph was taken late one night in early 2001 of the pair together at a @entity21 apartment owned by @entity22 , daughter of the shamed late newspaper boss @entity23			0
the picture shows the @entity1 ’s left hand cradling ms @entity2 ’s bare midriff			1
at the time , she was 17 ; he , on the other hand , was a 40 - year - old father of two			0
so how did this image come to be taken ? 2 ms @entity2 claims to have first met prince @entity1 at ms @entity22 ’s property the previous afternoon			1
during this initial encounter ( over tea and biscuits ) , @entity2 says the @entity1 was asked to guess her age			2
@entity1 correctly estimated that she was 17 , prompting ms @entity22 to reportedly joke that @entity38 ‘ would soon have to trade her in ’			2
did the @entity1 indeed meet her that day ? 3 according to ms @entity2 — in a legal claim filed in @entity40 last month — she and prince @entity1 had sexual contact in the hours after they returned from the @entity43			1
this , you have vehemently denied			0
ms @entity2 claims , however , that this alleged tryst was far from being a one - off : she says that she met the prince on a second occasion at @entity38 ’s apartment in @entity50 at @entity51			2
when she arrived that day , she alleges that the @entity1 was seated in a leather armchair in the library , with a girl called @entity55 on his knee			2
so did prince @entity1 meet ms @entity2 at @entity38 ’s apartment at @entity51 ? and , furthermore , has he ever met miss @entity55 ? 4 the lawsuit , filed last month at @entity40 @entity60 in @entity61 , alleges that a third sexual encounter took place shortly afterwards in 2001 , on @entity38 ’s private island in the @entity65			1
ms @entity2 claims that she and ‘ seven @entity70 girls ’ were ‘ told to assemble in a big cabana ’ on the island , where prince @entity1 and @entity38 were sitting in armchairs			1
you have described her claims as ‘ false and without foundation ’			0
but did the @entity1 ever visit @entity38 ’s private island ? if so , why ? and did he ever meet ms @entity2 there ? 5 @entity38 ’s former handyman @entity76 alleges that prince @entity1 attended naked swimming pool parties at the billionaire ’s @entity40 mansion in the early 2000s and was treated to regular massages by a harem of adolescent girls there			1
in sworn legal papers filed in 2011 , @entity76 described the house as being full of pictures of naked young women , and said that the @entity1 stayed in a blue guest room which contained soap in the shape of male and female genitalia			2
he also claimed to have set up massage tables on which the royal guest was treated on a daily basis			0
visit : @entity38 and @entity22 were among guests on this pheasant shoot , attended by @entity1 ( right ) , at @entity97 , @entity98 , after the @entity1 and the @entity8 businessman apparently became friends you have , of course , robustly denied wrongdoing			1
but did the @entity1 indeed ever stay at @entity38 ’s @entity40 home ? if so , why ? did he share its swimming pool with naked young women ? did he ever receive massages from young women there ? 6 prince @entity1 appears to have regarded @entity38 as a close friend			1
the @entity8 was invited to visit @entity97 , @entity111 and @entity112 as a guest of the @entity114			0
in turn , the @entity1 was invited , and agreed to go , on holiday to @entity117 with him , where he was photographed on @entity38 ’s yacht surrounded by topless women			2
despite the scrutiny it attracted , the @entity120 has never explained the exact nature of prince @entity1 ’s relationship with @entity38			1
were they purely social acquaintances ? or did they ever have wider business or financial links ? did the prince have any idea of @entity38 ’s criminal behaviour ? ms @entity133 admitted that accepting money from @entity38 had been ‘ a gigantic error of judgment ’ 7 in 2005 , police began investigating @entity38 ’s abuse of young girls			0
the following year , they filed an affidavit saying that he should be charged with four counts of unlawful sex with a minor and one of molestation			0
in the meantime , dozens of alleged victims came forward			0
the case was settled in 2008 , when @entity38 struck a deal with prosecutors : he agreed to plead guilty to a single charge of soliciting prostitution from a minor , for which he would be jailed for 18 months			0
in return , all other inquiries were dropped and immunity granted to a number of @entity38 ’s alleged associates , including ms @entity22			0
that deal remains highly controversial , with many feeling that @entity38 got off excessively lightly			0
a lawsuit filed in @entity40 last month now claims that prince @entity1 was among those who made ‘ efforts ’ on behalf of @entity38 ‘ to persuade the [ @entity8 ] government to give him a more favourable plea arrangement and / or non-prosecution agreement ’			1
in response , you have said that ‘ the @entity1 would never interfere in an active legal case and did not do so in this case ’			2
but while he may not have ‘ interfered ’ , did he discuss @entity38 , formally or informally , with any person connected with the @entity8 government , or @entity8 authorities , during the period from 2005 - 2008 when his friend was under investigation ? 8 prince @entity1 visited @entity50 and @entity179 in september 2006 , and @entity40 in february 2008			1
did he discuss @entity38 ’s case with anyone at all during any of those visits ? and did he meet @entity38 , or anyone connected with him , during those trips ? official records show that @entity1 also met with sir @entity186 , the then @entity187 ambassador to @entity179 , in september 2006 , and also with the then @entity189 minister @entity188 in july 2005			0
was @entity38 ’s case discussed at any of those meetings ? and did the prince raise his case , formally or informally , with any person connected to the @entity187 government ? 9 in 2010 , after @entity38 had been imprisoned for soliciting girls for underage prostitution , the @entity1 ’s ex-wife , @entity133 , agreed to accept a gift of £ 15,000 from him , in order to help clear her debts			2
after this was revealed by the @entity203 in 2011 , ms @entity133 admitted that accepting the money had been ‘ a gigantic error of judgment ’			0
was prince @entity1 aware of this gift ? did he help solicit it ? and has the tainted money since been returned to @entity38 ? 10 finally , in 2011 , after @entity38 had been freed from prison , the @entity210 published a photograph of him strolling with prince @entity1 in @entity50 ’s @entity213			1
the image caused widespread outrage , and led to the @entity1 ’s resignation as @entity187 ’s roving trade ambassador			0

prince @entity1 accused of *sleeping* with ' sex slave ' @entity2
the @entity1 has robustly denied all of miss @entity2 ' allegations
soon murky affair will face scrutiny via cases due to come before courts
