by @entity0 we are better off and have access to more medicines than ever before			0
but new research shows we 're a nation embroiled in a health crisis , wilfully neglecting our wellbeing and expecting the already overburdened @entity8 to pick up the pieces			2
the study , which looks at the the average health of men and women in the @entity14 , reveals some alarming statistics about our diet and lifestyle , dubbed by experts a ' ticking timebomb '			1
we 're constantly being told that to be ' healthy '			0
we should eat five portions of fruit and veg a day , have a body mass index ( @entity34 ) of between 18 and 25 , drink 1.5 - 2 litres of water a day and aim for seven hours of sleep a night			1
smoking is obviously out , while men should drink no more than 21 units of alcohol a week and women 14 , according to official @entity43 guidelines			0
and when it comes to exercise , we should all be doing at least 150 minutes of ( at least ) moderate ( if not high ) intensity physical activity each week			0
but in reality , it seems things are very different , the report from @entity50 shows			0
it was compiled after questioning 4,000 people across the @entity14 to paint a portrait of what @entity54 and mrs average look like from a health perspective			1
when it comes to men , mr @entity58 eats 3.3 portions of his ‘ 5 a day ’ , has a @entity34 of 26.2 ; only drinks 953ml ( less than a litre ) of water a day and sleeps for 6.4 hours a night			1
experts say we are aware of what we should be doing to maintain good health , but we deliberately ignore the guidelines set out for us and it seems we are n't deluded - we know we are unhealthy - we just ca n't be bothered to do anything about it - most likely because we know the @entity8 is on hand to fix us , the report suggests he also does just 73 minutes of cardio a week and 1.4 muscle strengthening work outs ; smokes 3.8 cigarettes a day and and drinks 13.6 units of alcohol a week			1
ms average fares slightly better on the food front , managing 3.5 portions of her ‘ 5 a day ’			1
however she too has a higher than average @entity34 of 25.9 and drinks even less water than her male counterpart : 896ml of water			1
she also sleeps for 6.5 hours a night , does 69 minutes of cardio a week and 1.1 muscle strengthening workouts			0
she smokes 3.3 cigarettes a day ; and drinks 8.4 units of alcohol a week			2
experts say we are aware of what we should be doing to maintain good health , but we deliberately ignore the guidelines set out for us			1
for example , despite failing to meet the @entity104 's recommendations , the report reveals that the public knows it should be eating ‘ five a day '			1
respondents aged 16 - 24 eat the fewest portions ( 2.9 ) , while those aged 65 - 74 eat the most ( 4.1 )			2
the study , which looks at the health of the average health of men and women in the @entity14 , reveals some alarming statistics about our diet and lifestyle , dubbed by experts a ' ticking timebomb ' it seems we are n't deluded - we know we are unhealthy - we just ca n't be bothered to do anything about it - most likely because we know the @entity8 is on hand to fix us , the report suggests			1
when asked how healthy they think the nation currently is , 71 per cent of respondents answered either ‘ not very healthy ’ or ‘ not at all healthy ’			1
when asked the same question about the nation ’s health 50 years ago , only 29 per cent of respondents answered negatively			2
the report also explores the mental wellbeing of the nation and reveals women fall victim to stress more than men ( 48 per cent and 35 per cent respectively )			2
they are also more likely to have suffered from depression , anxiety and insomnia and loneliness ( on average around 40 per cent of women for each condition compared with 30 per cent of men )			0
the different sexes also deal with stress differently			0
both parties watch tv to unwind , but women are more likely to read a book or have a bath			0
instead , men are more likely to turn to alcohol			0
the report also reveals the worrying statistic that mr @entity58 has a @entity34 of 26.2 and mrs @entity153 has a @entity34 of 25.9			1
both these figures indicate someone who is overweight and at an increased risk of developing heart disease , stroke and type 2 diabetes			0
@entity34 is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres squared			0
using their @entity34 as a gauge , more than half the population ( 52.5 per cent ) is classified as either overweight or obese , with 6 per cent deemed underweight			0
a total of 42 per cent of the population has a healthy @entity34			1
experts say that staying hydrated is also key to good health - and staving off hunger pangs			1
those aged 35 - 44 drink the most water ( 1 litre a day ) , and the over 85s drink the least – on average , just 487mls a day			1
it is not a lack of knowledge on the subject that leads to the nation drinking too little , as half of us know we should be drinking more			0
and while @entity181 may only have needed four hours sleep a night , it is widely accepted that 7 - 8 hours is the optimal amount of sleep needed			2
however , mrs average only manages 6.5 hours a night , while mr @entity58 has slightly less ( 6.4 )			1
the report also explores the mental wellbeing of the nation and reveals women fall victim to stress more than men ( 48 per cent and 35 per cent respectively ) the different sexes also deal with stress differently			0
both parties watch tv to unwind , but women are more likely to read a book or have a bath			0
instead , men are more likely to turn to alcohol those aged 16 - 24 get the most sleep ( 7 hours a night on average ) , while those over 84 have the least ( 5.5 hours )			2
commenting on the findings , medical director of @entity50 , dr @entity203 , said : ' at a time when modern medicine is making consistent major breakthroughs to give us longer lives and treat illnesses that even 20 years ago were fatal , the @entity14 population appears to be doing everything in its power to make those extra years as unhealthy and miserable as possible			1
' we can not continually rely on the @entity8 to pick up the pieces of our below average approach to looking after ourselves : this laissez - faire approach is massively overburdening our country ’s health service			2
' an ageing population and advances in medical science , alongside the surge in complex chronic illnesses , mean the @entity8 as it was originally conceived is becoming increasingly threatened			0

4,000 @entity14 were surveyed to paint a picture of @entity54 and mrs average
@entity229 reveals we fail to follow 7 out of 8 health guidelines
mr @entity58 eats 3.3 portions of his ‘ 5 a day ’ and has a @entity34 of 26.2
mrs @entity153 eats 3.5 portions a day but has a higher - than average @entity34
experts say @entity14 are aware of the healthy changes we should make
but we deliberately ignore the guidelines set out for us
almost three *quarters* of people think that @entity14 as a nation is unhealthy
