by @entity0 published : 15:38 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 17:08 est , 7 january 2013 abducted : @entity1 went missing in 1957 and is thought to have been murdered by rapist @entity2 she has been missing , presumed murdered , for 56 years , but yesterday the search for schoolgirl @entity1 reached what is certain to be its final destination			1
in a graveyard a short distance from the 11 - year - old 's former home , police erected protective tents around a family lair where eight bodies are known to be buried			2
as officers prepare to begin exhuming the bodies , they may learn whether there is a ninth set of remains buried in the @entity21 family plot in @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24			1
if an extra body is found , forensic tests will establish if it is that of @entity1 , who would have been 67 if she had lived			1
if nothing untoward is uncovered , then her disappearance will continue to haunt her family and hometown forever			0
the youngster is believed to have been abducted and murdered by @entity2 , who was driving the bus that @entity1 took as she set off to a local shop in @entity23 on february 23 , 1957			1
@entity2 , a known sex offender , was jailed for rape shortly after @entity1 's disappearance but he did not figure in the initial police inquiry			1
he died in 2006 shortly after telling his daughter @entity39 that @entity1 had haunted him all his life			1
mrs @entity39 , 63 , has believed for decades that her father was @entity1 's killer and it was she who identified the @entity21 family lair as the most likely burial spot			1
last month , sheriff @entity46 granted a petition brought by @entity1 's sisters @entity48 and @entity50 to allow exhumation after relatives of those buried in the lair raised no objections			2
digging is expected to begin shortly after dawn under a team led by forensic anthropologist professor @entity59 of @entity60			2
the exhumation process may last several days			0
it has been suggested that @entity63 secreted @entity1 's body into the lair in the weeks following her death when the grave was opened for the burial of @entity21 , who died aged 80			1
it has emerged that @entity2 once told a colleague that mr @entity21 had done him ' a big favour '			0
mrs @entity39 , who has extensively researched the case , said : ' i believe in my heart we 'll find her			0
' the evidence we have only points in that direction			0
i pray for a successful conclusion because , whatever happens , this will be the last act			0
there is no other avenue to go down			0
' mrs @entity48 , 69 , who lives in @entity83 , said : ' our mother and father went to their graves never knowing what happened to @entity1			2
' my sister and i are growing old			0
we do n't want to suffer the same fate			0
we 'll be by our phones , praying for news			0
' exhumation : police searching for the body of murdered schoolgirl @entity1 cordon off @entity98 in @entity23 , @entity24			1

forensic *specialists* exhume remains at grave in @entity24 , @entity102
@entity1 went missing 1957 and was never found
