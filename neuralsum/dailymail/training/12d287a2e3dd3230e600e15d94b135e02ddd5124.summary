experts hope it could lead to a diabetes cure a mother has become one of the first in the country to undergo a pioneering operation which it is hoped will one day lead to a cure for diabetes			1
the ground - breaking procedure takes cells from dead patients and transplants them to the living			1
deputy headteacher @entity1 , from @entity20 , who suffers from type one diabetes , has undergone the operation to replace the vital @entity23 , which are responsible for producing insulin , and has started to see her symptoms reverse			1
in type one diabetes the immune system mistakenly destroys the cells so they no longer make the hormone , which leads to dangerously low blood sugar levels			1
but now medics have discovered the a way to transplant the pancreatic cells from deceased patients - which means the recipient â€™s body can once again produce insulin			1
the breakthrough could potentially lead to a cure for hundreds of thousands of diabetics , according to @entity20 medic dr @entity41			1
mrs @entity1 , 43 , from @entity44 , @entity45 , had the transplant as part of a trial at @entity49 three weeks ago - and has already started to feel the positive effects			1
the teacher , who is mother to @entity52 , four , and three - year - old @entity53 , said : ' this operation has turned back the clock for me			2
' the side effects of diabetes become worse as you get older but , since the operation , my symptoms have started to reverse			2
' i am now on a significantly lower dosage of insulin and i have only suffered one hypo ( hypoglycemic attack ) this week , whereas before i was having around five			0
' hypoglycemia occurs when the level of glucose present in the blood falls below a set point			0
if severe , it can lead to a coma			0
mrs @entity1 had the transplant at @entity73 three weeks ago - and has already started to feel the positive effects mrs @entity1 , who is married to chartered surveyor @entity75 , was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 19			1
her consultant dr @entity78 suggested an @entity23 transplant when her condition worsened this year			0
' i looked into it and saw that it was quite cutting edge			0
he put me forward for it and i was lucky that a match was found so quickly , ' she said			0
dr @entity78 , consultant physician in diabetes and endocrinology at @entity90 , is the first to set up an @entity91 in the @entity92			0
he said : ' this procedure could potentially lead to a cure one day			2
' there are still a few challenges ahead , but this transplant could make it feasible one day to find a cure for diabetes and hope for the 250,000 sufferers in the @entity103			1
' the procedure involves obtaining cells from the pancreas of a dead donor and injecting them into the diabetic 's liver			2
once there , the cells get to work producing insulin			0
throughout the pancreas are clusters of cells known as the islets of @entity118			0
these islets are made up of several types of cells , including beta cells which make the insulin			0
people with type 1 diabetes fail to produce enough insulin or can not use it properly , which means they have to rely on injections of the hormone			2
the minimally - invasive transplants , which can take just 45 minutes , mean diabetics can live their lives on fewer or no injections .			0

@entity1 , who suffers from type one diabetes , is one of only a *handful* of people to have *successfully* had the operation
the ground - breaking procedure takes cells from dead patients and transplants them to the living
experts hope it could lead to a cure for hundreds of thousands of diabetes sufferers
