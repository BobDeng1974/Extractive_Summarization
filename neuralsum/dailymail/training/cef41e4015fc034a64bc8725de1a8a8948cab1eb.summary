how birds rapidly evolved to have feathers , fly and sing is revealed in a major study where the genomes of 45 species of modern birds were sequenced , to generate the most reliable avian tree of life to date			1
the international project charts a ' big bang ' burst of bird evolution during the 10 to 15 million years after the mass extinction of dinosaurs 66 million years ago , the period gave rise to nearly all of the 10,000 - plus species of birds on @entity17 today			1
close - ups of the diagram can be seen in the video below the study also suggests that the earliest common ancestor of land birds , which include parrots and songbirds as well as hawks and eagles , was a scaled predator			1
the four - year project , which involved researchers from the @entity38 's @entity37 , decoded and compared the genetic fingerprints of 45 bird species , including the woodpecker , owl , penguin , hummingbird and flamingo as well as those of three reptile species and humans			1
the vast study provides fresh insights into how bird genes differ from those of mammals , and the biological mechanisms that gave rise to the vast diversity among birds			2
decoding the genomes enabled the experts to investigate at which point in each species ' history specialised characteristics developed , such as feathers , flight and song			0
scientists completed the largest whole genome study of a single class of animals to date by mapping the tree of life for birds			1
avian genetic samples from @entity76 's @entity75 , which has one of the largest vertebrate tissue collections in the world ( shown ) , were used for this study the study also suggests that the earliest common ancestor of land birds , which include parrots and songbirds as well as hawks and eagles ( stock image ) , was a scaled predator how birds rapidly evolved to have feathers , fly and sing is revealed in a major study where the genomes of 45 species of modern birds were sequenced , to generate the most reliable avian tree of life to date			1
a simplified version is shown previous attempts to reconstruct the avian family tree using partial dna sequencing or anatomical and behavioural traits have met with contradiction and confusion			0
this is because modern birds split into species early and in such quick succession , which that they did not evolve enough distinct genetic differences at the genomic level			1
to resolve the timing and relationships of modern birds , researchers used something known as whole - genome dna sequences to infer the bird species tree			1
' in the past , people have been using 10 to 20 genes to try to infer the species relationships , ' @entity121 of @entity122			2
' what we 've learned from doing this whole - genome approach is that we can infer a somewhat different phylogeny [ family tree ] than what has been proposed in the past			0
‘ we 've figured out that protein - coding genes tell the wrong story for inferring the species tree			2
’ there are two general types of gene in the human genome : non-coding rna genes and protein - coding genes instead of focusing on protein - coded genes , @entity76 contributed to the reconstruction of the bird tree by analysing something called loci called ultra-conserved elements , or @entity145			1
by aligning these highly conserved parts of the genome and analysing the subtle variations across the different species , the @entity147 data helped piece together this new tree of life for birds			2
researchers found that the @entity147 data provided consistent results to infer evolutionary history whereas traditionally , scientists have used data from the protein coding parts of the genome called exons for this purpose			0
' it opens up the potential in terms of the types of data people will collect and use in the future when reconstructing the tree of life , ' said @entity171 , @entity172			0
once they inferred a tree from the data , collaborators used the fossil record to date the divergence of each species across millions of years			2
they found that birdsong evolved independently at least twice , for example			0
parrots and songbirds gained the ability to learn and mimic vocal activity independently of hummingbirds , despite sharing many of the same genes			1
this is surprising because animals with similar characteristics usually share a close common ancestor			0
the findings are relevant because some of brain processes that are involved in birds singing are also associated with human speech production			0
more than 200 scientists contributed to the @entity198 , and the findings are published in 23 scientific papers , including eight in the journal @entity202			1
as part of the study , researchers from the @entity204 found that chickens and turkeys experienced fewer large genomic changed than other birds , as they evolved from their dinosaur ancestor			1
professor @entity212 explained that the chicken and turkey lineages have undergone the fewest number of changes compared to their ancient avian ancestor thought to be a feathered dinosaur			1
one report by dr @entity220 , of @entity221 , describes the sequencing of three crocodilian genomes - the @entity225 alligator 's , the saltwater crocodile 's , and the @entity228 gharial 's - which represent birds ' closest living relatives			2
dr @entity220 said : ' the molecular evolution of birds is much faster than it is in crocodiles , turtles and other reptilian lineages			0
so this avian lineage seems to be faster than other reptiles , but not faster than mammals			0
' by studying the genes of penguins as part of the huge study , scientists at the @entity241 in @entity242 discovered that penguins have a vast number of genes responsible for creating the raw material needed for feathers - proteins known as beta - keratins			1
they carry more genes for a particular type of beta keratin than any other bird and it is thought this is what allows them develop their thick plumage of short , stiff feathers that keep them warm			0
the scientists also discovered that penguins have a gene called @entity266 , which in humans is known to be involved in a dermatological disease characterised by thick skin on the palms and feet			0
frozen samples of muscle tissue from bird species ( pictured ) collected by the @entity274 were the source of dna extracted in @entity122 labs			0
the dna was then sent to @entity278 in @entity279 for full genome sequencing one report by dr @entity220 , of @entity221 , and colleagues describes the sequencing of three crocodilian genomes - the @entity225 alligator 's , the saltwater crocodile 's ( pictured ) , and the @entity228 gharial 's - which represent birds ' closest living relatives it 's believed these genes may help the penguins develop a uniquely thick skin compared to other birds			1
building on the huge project , scientists at the @entity295 in @entity296 have created 48 open access databases to share and expand on the information associated with the birds ' genomes			2
they hope that researchers from around the world will continue to upload their own data , offering further insights to the genetics of modern birds			2
such information will be useful for helping scientists to understand why infectious diseases , such as bird flu , affect some species but not others			1
professor @entity314 , of the @entity295 , said : ' this is just the beginning			0
' we hope that giving people the tools to explore this wealth of bird gene information in one place will stimulate further research			0
' ultimately , we hope the research will bring important insights to help improve the health and welfare of wild and farmed birds			0
' adélie penguins have eight genes for metabolising fat , which may allow them to adapt quickly to warmer conditions but could leave them struggling in colder weather when food sources are more scarce			0
