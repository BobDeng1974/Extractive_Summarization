by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 17 july 2012 updated : 07:18 est , 17 july 2012 @entity1 could lose touch with its latest @entity4 rover just as it attempts to land on the red planet on 6 august			1
the @entity7 vehicle , which is the size of a car , is aiming for a deep depression known as @entity10			1
the @entity12 space agency will be tracking the descent with satellites , but today admitted its key craft could be in the wrong place			2
engineers have been tackling a fault on the @entity20 satellite and it is no longer in the best observational orbit			1
artist 's impression of @entity1 's @entity7 on the surface of @entity4 the team are now in a frantic race to move it back in the next three weeks , or @entity1 will lose signal to the rover just as it is about to touch down			1
engineers today tried to play down the gaffe , claiming it will not affect the outcome of the landing because @entity7 's descent manoeuvres are all performed automatically			1
' @entity20 right now looks like it may not be in the same spot that we 'd expected it to be , ' said @entity40 , the director of @entity1 's @entity4 exploration programme			1
' there may be some changes in real - time communication			1
we 'll let you know as this develops ; we still have more work to do			0
but keep in mind , there is no risk to [ @entity7 ] landing			2
it does not have an effect on that			0
' the yellow oval shows the elliptical landing target for @entity1 's @entity7 rove in the @entity10 area of the red planetr			1
a recent study suggested that just digging inches beneath the surface could uncover complex organic molecules that could show that life once existed on @entity4			0
the rover , in a protective capsule , will hit the top of the @entity4 atmosphere at 20,000km/h ( 13,000mph ) and attempt to slow to just one metre per second to execute a soft touchdown			0
the landing system includes a supersonic parachute and a rocket - powered crane			1
it was expected that the @entity20 orbiter would track the whole descent , relaying @entity77 signals from the rover right up to the landing and for a few minutes beyond			1
the scoop on @entity7 , which is due to arrive on @entity4 in august , will dig four inches beneath the surface - enough to find the complex building blocks of life , particularly in new craters excavated by recent asteroid impacts			1
some scientists such as @entity86 of @entity87 believe that life may even have originated on @entity4 , then been carried to @entity89 on asteroids			0
stick a shovel in the ground and scoop			0
that ’s about how deep scientists need to go in order to find evidence for ancient life on @entity4 , if there is any to be found , a new study suggests			0
@entity1 's @entity7 the results suggest that , should @entity4 harbor simple organic molecules , @entity1 ’s prospects for discovering them during @entity7 ’s explorations are better than previously thought , said @entity104 of the @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity107 , lead author of the study			1
complex organic molecules could hint more strongly at the possibility of past life on the planet			2
these molecules , made up of 10 or more carbon atoms , could resemble known building blocks of life such as the amino acids that make up proteins			0
however , within 2 to 4 inches beneath the surface , the amount of radiation reduces tenfold			0
although that ’s still extreme , the team reports that simple organic molecules , such as a single formaldehyde molecule , could exist at this depth -- and in some places , specifically young craters , the complex building blocks of life could remain as well			0
‘ right now the challenge is that past @entity4 landers have n’t seen any organic material whatsoever , ’ @entity104 said			0
‘ we know that organic molecules have to be there but we ca n’t find any of them in the soil			0
’ its assignment is to investigate whether conditions have been favorable for microbial life and for preserving clues in the rocks about possible past life			0
the goal of the mission is to assess whether the landing area has ever had or still has environmental conditions favorable to microbial life			2
curiosity will land near the foot of a layered mountain inside @entity10 , layers of this mountain contain minerals that form in water			0
the portion of the crater floor where @entity7 will land has an alluvial fan likely formed by water - carried sediments			2
curiosity will also carry the most advanced load of scientific gear ever used on @entity4 ’ surface , a more than 10 times as massive as those of earlier @entity4 rovers			0
curiosity is about twice as long and five times as heavy as @entity1 ’s twin @entity170 , when evaluating how deep organic molecules might persist beneath the surface , previous studies have mainly focused on the maximum depth , approximately 1.5 meters ( 5 feet ) , that cosmic radiation reaches because beyond that point organic molecules could survive , unharmed , for billions of years , @entity104 said			1
curiosity is set to land in @entity10 on august 6			2
whether this 3.5 - billion - year - old crater has fresher craters within it is uncertain			2
however , @entity104 hopes that his team ’s findings will at least help guide @entity1 on where to drill once the rover has landed and influence where future generations of rover landers will touch down .			1
