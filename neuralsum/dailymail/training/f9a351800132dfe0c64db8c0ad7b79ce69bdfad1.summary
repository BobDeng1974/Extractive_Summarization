' the best part is that i 'm a huge @entity8 fan - it would be awful if i had to impersonate someone i hated			2
if i ever get to meet her i just want to thank her for giving me this life and for looking so much like me			0
' she bought her first house aged just 19 with partner mechanic @entity53 , 28 , for £ 115,000 and three years later they bought their second home for £ 150,000			1

@entity7 bears a striking resemblance to the young pop star in the school girl outfit from @entity8 's debut single ' @entity67 ' over the years she has earned £ 300,000 impersonating the star			1
but life was very different for @entity7 before , who worked in her local cafe in @entity13 in @entity14 for two years until she was 17			1

over time the catcalls of ' hit me one more time ' and ' hey , it 's @entity8 ! ' from passersby in the street became more frequent and @entity7 eventually entered a lookalike competition for @entity107 at the age of 16			1
incredibly she failed to make the cut but the following year she was called back on the show , called @entity111 and their doubles , and won her category			0

@entity7 relaxes , enjoying her luxury lifestyle , in her hot tub in the sexy outfit worn by @entity8 in her ' i 'm a slave for you ' music video @entity7 first noticed her resemblance to @entity8 ( left ) when she was 16 but it was after pursuing modelling for a while that people really convinced her she looked like the popstar @entity7 's success means her day - to - day life now is a far cry from her old life where she worked as a waitress the troubled singer spent spells in rehab , attacked paparazzi , lost control of her finances and custody of her children and famously shaved her head			1
@entity7 's fortunes began to mirror those of her famous counterpart and as @entity8 's stardom began to wane , so did her lookalike 's			1
she said : ' when @entity8 first had her meltdown and shaved her hair i was still getting bookings and even went out to @entity180 for a job			2
the wilder she acted , the more work i was getting			0
' but then my partner and i moved house , taking out a bigger mortgage			0
we figured no matter what @entity8 did there was nothing that would stop my busy work schedule because the press always lapped up her antics			2

we soon fell behind with our mortgage , and i had to sell my sports car to pay off some of our debts			0
' it was a really difficult time and i began to feel desperately low and guilty for getting us into such a mess			0
i struggled to get regular work with the recession , and ended up working for agencies and doing odd jobs to try and keep up with the bills			0
' the only proper job i 'd ever had was being @entity8 and although i had a beauty qualification i had never put it to any use			2
i had nothing to fall back on			0
when @entity8 recovered from her 2007 breakdown , out of the public eye , work dried up for @entity7 , causing financial hardship and worries about the future , but @entity8 's comeback means work is up again ' we went through the winter not being able to have the heating on because we could n't afford to pay the bills and we had to layer up with jumpers and socks and snuggle under blankets just to keep warm			2
' the work soon took off again as @entity8 released her fifth studio album @entity232 , going on tour and making the top ten in charts all around the world			0
@entity7 said : ' work slowly started coming in again with odd appearances here and there , which helped towards the bills			0
' the more she did , the more work i started to get again and we started to get back on track			0
