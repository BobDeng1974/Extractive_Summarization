by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:00 est , 29 december 2012 updated : 09:45 est , 4 january 2013 a new device that sends a high - frequency electrical pulse through the spine could revolutionise the treatment of severe back pain , according to a new study			1
a team at @entity10 ’s and @entity9 , @entity11 , is the first in the world to implant the @entity15 spinal cord stimulator in 100 patients who would otherwise need surgery to stop their back pain			1
the device is less invasive than surgery and cheaper			2
@entity15 therapy uses frequency 200 times higher than current spinal cord stimulation therapy			1
pain in the back : the new device sends high - frequency electrical pulses through the spine to aid severe back pain dr @entity27 , consultant in pain management , who led the @entity15 study , said : ‘ this new high - frequency version goes beyond what previous devices could do to give immediate pain relief without any tingling			1
‘ and we used to have to talk to the patient in the middle of the operation to make sure where they were feeling the tingling sensations			2
with the @entity15 device , they can sleep			1
’ patients have a wire , connected to a battery pack , inserted into their epidural space			0
if the electrical current that is emitted stops their pain , they will have this wire removed and replaced by the full @entity15 implant			1
the £ 15,000 implant is switched on using a remote control			0
at typical settings , patients can use it for at least a day to a few days at a time			0
study in pain : @entity10 's hospital in @entity11 is trialling the machine on 100 patients ‘ patients have no idea whether other kinds of surgery will work , whereas with the @entity15 they know what to expect , ’ says dr @entity27			1
‘ we give them a trial of the device before going ahead with a permanent implant			0
’ the procedure will not work for everyone , however			0
one in three wo n’t be suitable because previous surgeries have complicated their condition , or their pain is too widespread			0
clinical data from a recent @entity78 clinical trial shows that the majority of patients ( 88 % ) have a successful result			0
patients accepted for a trial of the device are also required to undergo a residential course at @entity10 ’s and @entity86 ’ , which involves cognitive behaviour therapy , relaxation and learning to reduce their pain medication			2
‘ the sky is the limit as to how many patients we could treat every year , so long as we have the resources and access to an operating theatre , ’ says dr @entity27 .			0

spinal cord stimulator sends electrical pulses through the spine
@entity15 's pulses are 200 times *faster* than current stimulator therapy
