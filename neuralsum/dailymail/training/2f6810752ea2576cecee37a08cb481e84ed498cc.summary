tv watchdogs are under pressure to launch an inquiry into the rip - off cost of watching live @entity5 football on television , which can be more than £ 600 a year			1
the pay tv and broadband company @entity7 claims the way the @entity5 sells the rights to top flight matches means armchair fans in the @entity13 are hit with unfair fees			1
the net result is that clubs like @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 are sharing in billions of pounds from fans whose passion and loyalty is being abused			0
tv watchdogs are under pressure to launch an inquiry into the rip - off cost of watching live @entity5 football on television , which can be more than £ 600 a year @entity7 claims that viewers in the @entity13 are getting a raw deal both on the cost of watching matches and the fact that many games are not broadcast live			1
it calculates that the minimum monthly cost of watching live @entity5 games on the sports channels of @entity36 and @entity37 comes in at £ 51			1
that works out at £ 612 a year , which is more than four times higher than the @entity41 licence fee of £ 145.50 , which covers all of its many tv and radio channels , including @entity44			0
the £ 51 figure is much higher than the £ 21 month charge football fans in @entity47 must pay to see top flight teams such as the @entity49 and @entity50 in the @entity51			1
it is also more than double the £ 25 charged in @entity53 to watch @entity54 , and compares to £ 18 in @entity55 to follow @entity56 and @entity57 and just £ 10 a month in @entity58			1
access to games in the @entity13 is also far more limited compared to the rest of @entity62			0
here only 41per cent of @entity5 games – 154 out of 380 – are broadcast live in a season			2
by contrast all games are broadcast live on tv in @entity55 , @entity47 , @entity58 and @entity53			1
research commissioned by @entity7 found more than 15per cent of viewers say they could not watch the games they wanted through their tv provider , while 25per cent found that games were not included in their pay tv subscription			2
@entity78 @entity77 controls the ball during a @entity81 @entity5 match against @entity82 ; @entity7 claims the way @entity5 sells the rights to top flight matches means armchair fans in the @entity13 are hit with unfair fees @entity7 argues that the way the @entity5 packages and sells the tv rights to football in this country works to artificially inflate the price			1
as a result , the cost of @entity5 domestic live tv rights increased by 70per cent to a staggering £ 3 billion over three years in the last auction			2
it is predicted to rise by a further 60per cent when they are sold next time			0
the high prices charged by the @entity5 means teams in the top flight are able pay world stars like @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 well over £ 200,000 a week			1
it also means there is absolutely no chance of live @entity5 games ever returning to free - to - air terrestrial tv channels like the @entity41 and @entity111 ever again			2
while the sports channel subscriptions are extortionate enough in themselves , @entity37 has been accused of putting up many other charges for all its customers in order to cover the millions of pounds it has paid to the @entity5			0
@entity7 has asked @entity119 to open a formal investigation under the @entity121 into the arrangements by which the @entity5 sells live @entity13 television rights to its games			2
it claims the current regime causes ‘ significant consumer harm ’ resulting from escalating rights costs			0
the firm ’s chief corporate affairs officer , @entity128 , said : ‘ the rapidly rising cost of @entity5 live broadcast rights means @entity13 fans pay the highest prices in @entity62 to watch football on tv			1
@entity7 has asked @entity119 to investigate how the rights are sold ahead of the next auction			0
’ the @entity5 insisted the auction process it uses is entirely legal			0
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity141 audio - visual rights have always been sold in a transparent and open process			0
‘ regulators have examined our rights packaging and sales process in considerable detail in the past and found both of them to be compliant with @entity13 and @entity62 competition law			0
‘ if @entity119 chooses to investigate this complaint , we will of course be happy to demonstrate to @entity119 that this is the case			0

the minimum monthly cost of watching live @entity5 is £ 51
football fans in @entity47 pay £ 21 a month to watch top teams
in @entity53 fans pay £ 25 and in @entity55 it is just £ 18
