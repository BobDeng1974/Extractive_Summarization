of course you love them , but you ’d probably rather not travel large distances with them			0
children and babies are probably the most stressful additions to any journey			1
they kick and scream and cry and complain and repeat the cycle at varying volumes until you reach your destination			0
while there ’s little you can do solve the problem in its entirety - save leave them behind - there are a few things you can do to prevent some of the worst tantrums and forearm yourself for the open road			1
) book seats by the plane ’s engine who ’d have guessed it ? one of the best things to rock - a - bye - baby is the roar of an engine			1
according to @entity38 , who swear by the tip given to them by from an experienced air stewardess , although the engine is loud ; ‘ the womb was incredibly loud too – and they ’ll think they ’re back in their happy place			2
’ as an engine ’s location varies from plane to plane you ’ll need to find out what type of plane you are flying in then use @entity50 to see where that aircraft ’s engines are located before choosing your seat			1
out for the count : choose a seat that 's close to the plane 's engine if travelling with a baby to make them sleep 2			1
) surprise present tv presenter and consumer champion @entity60 has a useful trick to stem the bawling if you ’re little one has past the point of no return			0
before you get into the car / train / plane secretly wrap up one of their favourite toys without telling them			1
at the right moment hand it over for them to unwrap			0
it ca n't fail to make them smile and will calm them down quickly			0
surprise surprise : secretly wrap up your child 's favourite toy and present them with it to calm them down 3			1
) do your homework there are a few sites such as @entity87 and @entity88 which can keep you abreast of unexpected charges , requirements or rules when flying with a baby or child			1
some airlines such as easyjet and @entity97 give free priority boarding with an infant under two , some let you carry on pushchairs and car seats free of charge			2
@entity88 is especially good for detailed information about amenities such as bassinets , whether you have to reserve a separate seat for your baby and what type of car seats are allowed on board			1
disclaimer : this is a model family , it 's highly unlikely you will ever look as happy as them in an airport unless you take careful precautions sites such as @entity87 and @entity88 help keep you abreast of unexpected charges , requirements or rules 4			1
) sit at the back if you ca n’t sit near the engine , sit at the back of the plane			1
as @entity126 , co-director of @entity127 and mother - of - four writes on the @entity131 woman , you 'll be closer to the bathrooms , less likely to bother other passengers and possibly have more help from flight attendants			0
you 're going to have to wait for the push chair or stroller when you get off the plane anyway			2
back is best : you 'll be closer to the bathrooms , less likely to annoy others and be closer to flight attendents careful planning : follow these tips and you might just make it to your destination without falling to pieces 5			0
) get a travel jacket imagine @entity147 circumnavigating @entity149 's rainforest in @entity150			1
that 's the jacket you need to buy			1
according to @entity38 , you ’ll need all sorts of accouterments - from sweets to pens and paper and tissues - to placate the small ones and a purpose built travel jacket , with its many , many pockets , means you can easily access them at any time			2
plus , it doubles as a blanket if they get cold			2
just ensure it ’s lightweight so you can fold it up and stow it in your luggage when not needed			0
be prepared : buy an unattractive but practical jacket which has room for supplies and doubles up as a blanket 6			1
) book the shortest route while this is n’t rocket science , if you have a multi-leg trip involving train changes or more than one flight it ’s key to plan with military precision			0
sites like @entity187 can sort results into travel time so you can choose the faster route			2
equally , if you do have to have a stopover , leave at least an hour for children to stretch their legs , attack each other and have something to eat			2
if you have a stopover ensure you leave an hour for young ones to stretch , eat and get rid of some energy pack one of everything : @entity201 fights over who wants to use the blue crayon by giving everyone their own set 7			0
) pack one of everything it will save countless arguments			0
give each child their own version of everything that ’s practical too			0
this is especially important with crayons , according to @entity126			0
if they have their own pack they wo n’t fight over the best colours and you ’ll have a better journey			0
take one spare change of clothes for everyone and at least one plastic bag per person , which you will use for everything from rubbish and cleaning up disasters to emergency bags and keeping things dry after spillages .			0
