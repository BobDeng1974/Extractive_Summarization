her choice of thigh - high patent boots , mini skirt and above - the - knee red - and - gold bobble coat was certainly eyecatching			1
if @entity6 ’s intention was to upstage @entity7 , @entity8 ’s rather beautiful first lady , then she succeeded — though unfortunately not for the right reasons			1
rather , the home secretary looked a disturbing mix of one part dominatrix and one part @entity14 housewife , with those gloves that put me in mind of a pair of @entity20			0
@entity21 ! sporting s&m thigh boots , miniskirt and red and gold bobble coat this week , may goes into fashion meltdown on her way to meet the @entity29 and the president of @entity8 at 58 , what may appears to be suffering from is a classic 50s fashion crisis			1
having been there , i know the form this crisis takes			0
one day you survey yourself in the mirror and decide you ’re looking like a middle - aged frump and that if you do n’t watch out you ’ll soon be morphing , before your time , into a little old lady			1
your wardrobe is in a rut			0
you buy the same boring basics for weekends and the same smart suits or skirts and tops for work , year in year out			1
so , in an effort to update yourself , you rush out and start buying things that will make you feel fresher , flirtier , more youthful			0
unless you have teenage children to put you in your fashion place ( and may does n’t have children ) , you may find yourself with a whole new wardrobe that just does n’t chime with your looks , age or , in may ’s case , profession			2
husbands , being husbands , tend not to notice these things			0
girlfriends do n’t want to upset or undermine you , so they generally keep schtum			0
in may ’s case , the trajectory was slightly different because it appears that for one brief year in her early 50s she did hit her fashion stride with a wardrobe of flatteringly cut separates in a stylish palette of navy , white , black and taupe			1
it ’s not known whether she feared they made her invisible , however , but what ’s certain is that since 2010 her style has been characterised by eccentric and flamboyant outfits			2
her look has certainly changed over the years			0
in the early days after her election to @entity81 in 1997 , and the years from 2002 when she served in the @entity82 , her style evolved from ill - fitting suits in drab colours to garish : think of the voluminous orange mac she wore to the @entity88 conference in 2009			1
but once the @entity89 came into power and she was promoted to home secretary , she seemed to embark on a brief transformation after losing weight and finding her fashion feet			2
shortly after , though , the crisis set in and has been growing worse , culminating in this week ’s sartorial disaster			2
while her fetish for @entity100 style boots — she also wore them in 2013 for the @entity104 president ’s state visit — is @entity105 of @entity106 , i can empathise			2
when my marriage broke up in my mid- 50s , i bought a pair of similar boots in suede rather than patent or @entity112 , but after catching my reflection one day in a shop window , i thought : ‘ who am i trying to kid ? ’ admittedly , my 50s fashion panic was partly about attracting men in the wake of my divorce , which is not an issue for the happily married may			1
but it reflects a loss of fashion confidence at this stage of our lives when the shops are full of temptations that look great on hangers and 25 - year - olds , but not necessarily on us			1
the big difference between may and rest of us , of course , is that her fashion faux pas have to be played out in the full glare of the camera			2
if you play it safe , as the @entity143 does , you get criticised for being bland			0
go too trendy and you will be mocked for trying too hard			0
perhaps , when it comes to fashion , may should take a leaf out of @entity149 ’s book			0
the prime minister ’s wife always looks elegant and low - key , while promoting @entity153 fashion to an international audience			1
@entity6 is an attractive woman and has shapely and slender legs that are amazing for a woman of any age , but if when you think of the home secretary the first thing that springs to mind is her footwear and snazzy coats rather than her policies , she ’s getting something wrong			1
february 2000 mp may is a relative new girl , opting for sombre grey suit and pearls			0
but even then , the leopard - print bag and slit in her skirt hint at a wilder side october 2004 not just any old mac for the @entity88 party conference — but a @entity178 pink mac , with extra wide - legged trousers and clashing red shoes december 2005 black suede boots and a techni - colour nightmare coat at a party to celebrate @entity184 becoming @entity88 leader october 2009 an unflattering bright orange raincoat , possibly made out of a hot air balloon , for the @entity188 july 2010 despite the creases , this is a flattering suit with stylish accessories			1
an outfit that says may means business september 2010 on trend in an elegant floral cocoon coat			0
just a shame about the mismatched bag and shoes october 2010 leaving a @entity82 meeting at @entity200 in a winning combo of ice - blue silk jacket and flattering palazzo pants , teamed with a stylish bag may 2012 time to remind her that less is more ? at @entity207 , the multi-coloured jacket overwhelms the skirt , which looks as if it is caught in her knickers november 2013 first outing of the @entity214 kinky boots and another knock - ’ em - dead coat for a state visit			1
it ’s hard to imagine what she has to smile about in this garish outfit october 2014 ditch the girly bow and inexplicable gauntlets and may would look wonderful for a visit by the president of @entity225			0
over-icing the cake is never a good idea but it seems she ca n’t help herself			0

her choice of thigh - high patent boots this week was certainly eyecatching
for one brief year in her early 50s @entity6 may hit her fashion stride
her outfits now reflect a common loss of fashion confidence
