a new website allows travellers to plan where to get the most striking selfies and holiday shots			1
@entity5 is a platform where tourists can find and capture the best views from destinations across the world , which are then rated by other users			1
because the images are not publicity photos , the website 's creators hope it will offer a more realistic way for people to research the most picturesque holiday spots			1
they also hope it will act as a reliable travel guide for tourists looking to plan future trips			2
users can browse the website by locations including cities and countries , or categories such as restaurants , golf courses , parks and architecture to find destinations with the most scenic views			2
alternatively , if users do n't have anywhere specific in mind , they can browse the thumbnails on the world map to simply pick out views that catch the eye , or find the highest user - rated photos in a given area			1

@entity113 and @entity114 are the website 's creators			2
the couple decided to create a site where new and old traditions of travel sites are combined , and they say it is appealing to new adventurers and older , seasoned travellers			0
they said : ' there are so many @entity32 accounts , magazines , websites and articles covering breath - taking views from around the world , but most are professionally edited or taken by professional photographers			2
