by the standards of what has been a year of extremes , the past week has been among the better ones for @entity4			1
first a new contract with @entity6 and now a call - up to tour this winter with the @entity9			1
‘ back in may , as you know , my only focus was playing second - team cricket , ’ he told me on tuesday			1
‘ it just shows how quickly things can change in sport			0
’ @entity4 was buzzing and understandably so			1
but not because he sees a tour of @entity19 as an opportunity to secure a spot for next year ’s ashes			1
‘ one step at a time , ’ he insisted cheerfully			0
@entity4 has been named in the @entity9 squad to tour @entity19 in january and february the players travelling to @entity19 with @entity4 and their schedule for the january - february tour no , what matters more to @entity4 right now is the fact that people still believe in him ; that his country , as well as his county , think he has a future in the game after the difficulties he endured with a stress - related illness that forced him to leave the last @entity22 tour			1
‘ at 33 it would have been easy for the @entity40 to simply discard me , ’ he said			1
‘ but they ’ve been very supportive all along and i appreciate being given this chance			0
' it ’s been the same with @entity6			1
i had a year left on my contract and they ’ve given me another three			2
i have to say i was really pleased they had that confidence with regard to my future			0
’ @entity4 earned his selection with some outstanding performances for @entity6 towards the end of the summer			1
he joined the other @entity9 players two weeks ago for a screening session at @entity56 and then met with @entity9 selector @entity57 and @entity6 boss @entity58 last week			1
@entity4 spoke with @entity61 's @entity60 at his home in @entity63 - the batsman is excited about his return to the @entity9 fold via the @entity9 in @entity19 but insists he is keen to keep his @entity22 ambitions in check by the end of that process the @entity40 were only too happy to welcome @entity4 back into the fold , with @entity57 on tuesday citing his ‘ exceptional form and run - scoring exploits for @entity6 ’			1
‘ i was n’t playing thinking about an @entity9 recall , ’ said @entity4 , who was relaxing at home with his family			1
‘ after taking that second break from the game in april my only focus was just playing for @entity6			1
‘ but it feels just like it did in 07/08 when i was called into the @entity9			1
i did two tours back then and it aided my development hugely			0
i spent six weeks in three - star hotels in @entity84 but that ’s how you earn your stripes			2
’ @entity4 's @entity9 call - up follows his securing of a contract extension with county side @entity6 @entity4 has been named in the provisional 14 - man squad that will play two first - class matches against @entity19 in january , but will not feature in the five one - day matches that follow			1
that has led to speculation that he is being considered more for the @entity97 side and possibly the @entity22			0
@entity4 , however , urges a bit of caution there			1
‘ with regards to the one - dayers , because i ’ve not been around the set - up for a while i guess i would n’t be looked at as someone they could bring in for the @entity107 if there was an injury , ’ he says			2
‘ that ’s my reading of that one			0
and i do n’t see this particularly as me being on the comeback trail			0
everyone who is involved with the @entity9 will want to play for @entity9 and i ’ll be no different			1
‘ of course i ’d like to play in the @entity22			2
but i also know i ’ll have to be in good form to earn that right , and even then the decision still rests with the selectors			0
‘ let ’s just see how i go			0
there is no point in setting those goals at the moment			0
it ’s just a case of taking one step at a time			0
if you think where i was in may , my only focus was on playing second - team cricket again			2
it ’s really important not to get too far ahead and i hope everyone , you guys included , can do the same			0
i ’m just very happy to be where i am right now ; looking forward to three more years with @entity6 and a tour with the @entity9			1
’ six months ago , as he revealed in a moving interview with this newspaper last month , @entity4 was in a much darker place			1
he would go to bed not wanting the night to end , so much did he dread returning to work at @entity137 the following day			0
@entity4 admits he has come a long way in recent months : ' it just shows how quickly things can change in sport ’ on tuesday he was cracking jokes ; full of enthusiasm , excited			1
such is his modesty , however , he was actually a little stunned by all the fuss over his recall			0
‘ is it a slow news day or something ? ’ he said teasingly			0
‘ all it will take is @entity151 to say something or @entity153 ( @entity154 ) to tweet something			0
you see , i ’ll be back off the news agenda soon enough			0
’ it would probably be unwise for him to one day pursue a career as a news editor but in his own mind it would also be a mistake to put too much emphasis on his international recall			0
it is not the stuff of dreams in his view			0
‘ it was a dream when i played my first test for @entity9 , ’ he said			2
‘ but , as i ’ve said , i do n’t really even want to think about the ashes at this stage			0
@entity4 's selection follows a number of impressive performances for @entity6 this season ‘ i ’m really looking forward to going to @entity19			1
i love touring and i ’m looking forward to playing in @entity175			0
i ’ve not played there before			0
and i ’ll go in with my eyes open , just like i did seven years ago			0
there will be some training before @entity180 but i ’ll do some training with @entity6 before then to make sure i ’m ready			2
’ he will also continue to consult with dr @entity182 , the leading sports psychiatrist who has played such an important role in @entity4 ’s return to top - level cricket			1
@entity182 told him he was suffering from ‘ situational anxiety ’ , with @entity4 relieved to have found someone who finally understood the difficulties he was enduring			1
with a far more positive outlook , @entity4 is also now able to maintain his keen interest in other sports			1
last week he took a close friend from the @entity6 backroom staff to watch the @entity194 at @entity195			2
next week he hopes to see @entity196 play against @entity197 at @entity198			2
for a man who only a few months ago was n’t sure if he wanted to play cricket any more , life would appear to be good			2
