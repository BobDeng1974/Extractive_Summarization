with her floppy hat , designer boots and chic coat , @entity0 captured the hearts of parents everywhere on her way to @entity7 recently			1
yet some eagle - eyed mums and dads also spotted a business opportunity : with @entity0 and @entity13 lookalikes forging lucrative careers mimicking the couple , surely the market was ripe for @entity16 as well ? indeed , @entity18 ’s @entity17 has 32 @entity16 on its books , with a rush of approaches from new hopefuls			1
we picked our top ten @entity16 — and here they are , as cute as buttons , looking just like the famous little fashionista			1
spot the difference : the real @entity0 , left , and lookalike @entity27 , from @entity28 , right mum ca n't tell them apart @entity31 , three - and - a - half , lives in @entity28 , @entity32 , with mum @entity33 , 28 , dad @entity34 , 35 , who run a camper van building firm , and brother @entity36 , six			1
@entity33 says : when i show pictures of @entity0 to @entity27 , she says ‘ that ’s me , @entity40 ’s that strange man or woman holding me ? ’ that ’s how uncanny the resemblance is , even she ca n’t tell her and @entity0 apart			1
and if someone were to put pictures of them side by side i think i would struggle to say who was who			0
@entity27 attracts a lot of stares , which she likes because she ’s a confident , friendly girl			2
i ’ve heard the @entity54 children are very polite and i ’m proud to say @entity27 has lovely manners , too			0
@entity27 really is a little cracker			0
i ’m not a pushy mother , so i will only put her up for things she wants to do , as long as i do n’t have to pretend to be @entity0 — i do n’t think anyone would fall for that			1
seeing double : @entity18 ’s @entity17 has 32 @entity16 on its books , including @entity62 , left , and @entity63 , right modelling will pay for university @entity62 , three - and - a - half , lives in @entity66 , @entity67 , with mum @entity68 , 40 , dad @entity34 , 43 , both it consultants , and sister @entity70 , two			1
@entity68 says : my mum was the first to notice how much @entity62 looks like @entity0			1
last year , we were on a flight to @entity74 when the air stewardess touched me on the arm and said ‘ your daughter looks just like @entity0			1
’ so a year ago , @entity79 sent her photograph to a lookalike agency and they signed her up			0
any money @entity62 earns will go into a savings account for university			0
i ’m mystified how @entity62 came by her looks : i ’m more @entity86 and @entity34 looks more like @entity87			0
it ’s bizarre we should have produced almost identical daughters			2
strangers stop us in the street @entity63 , three , lives with mum @entity93 , a nursery nurse , and brother @entity95 , eight , in @entity96			0
@entity93 says : ever since @entity63 was tiny , strangers have approached me in shops and parks to comment on her resemblance to @entity0			1
i ’d always act surprised			0
it was touching seeing @entity0 with her big brother because @entity95 loves his little sister , too			1
it ’s not just the long light - brown hair that makes @entity0 and @entity63 so alike , it ’s their dark eyes , lips and the shape of their faces			1
so on a whim , i decided to send a picture to the agency a few days ago			0
i wish our daughters were n’t the only thing @entity0 and i have in common : i ’ve got a huge crush on @entity13 ! decoy : @entity120 , left , lives near close to @entity0 's grandparents , and @entity122 , right we live next to @entity0 ’s granny @entity120 , three , lives near @entity125 with stay - at - home mum @entity126 , 30 , and dad @entity127 , 31 , a computer maintenance worker			1
she has a brother @entity127 , two , and sister @entity128 , 11			0
@entity126 says : people used to say i looked like @entity0 because i have long straight brown hair and a turned - up nose — so it ’s no surprise @entity133 is a dead ringer for @entity0			1
it ’s a great honour — she ’s gorgeous			2
i joked to my husband that @entity133 was being trained to be a decoy for @entity0 , because her grandparents — @entity0 ’s parents — live nearby			1
i ’ve been to their house as a child , when they sold some furniture			0
they let us see their trophy room full of @entity0 ’s platinum cds and @entity13 ’s football trophies			1
i ’d love to say her brother dotes on her the way the @entity54 boys adore @entity0 , but they mostly squabble			1
she 's made thousands of pounds @entity122 , four , lives in @entity154 , @entity155 , with @entity156 , 33 , a stay - at - home mum , dad @entity158 , 37 , a printer , and sister @entity160 , ten			1
@entity156 says : when @entity122 was two , i was shopping in @entity161 when i was asked by another customer if i was @entity0 ’s nanny			1
she has appeared at several corporate events — usually with a @entity13 and @entity0 lookalike — and in newspapers and magazines			1
we put all her earnings into a savings account which she can access when she is 18			0
there are several thousand pounds in it already			0
of course , @entity172 has no idea who @entity0 is , but she loves the little boots and coats she wears on photoshoots			1
she loves travelling on the train , too , so every time we go to an event it ’s like a little holiday for her			2
we ’re all very excited whenever she is in the paper — and , if i ’m honest , she ’s a bit spoilt			2
like father , like daughter : @entity189 , @entity191 's father looks like @entity54 , and right , @entity188 dresses in sophisticated clothes like @entity0 @entity193 looks like @entity54 , too ! @entity191 , three , lives in @entity194 , @entity195 , with stay - at - home mum @entity196 , 31 , and dad @entity197 , 36 , a printer			1
@entity196 says : my friend rang me last week and said : ‘ i ’ve realised why i always feel like i know @entity0 — she looks just like your @entity70 ! ’ @entity70 has always looked like @entity0			1
when she was pictured in that black dress sitting on her dad ’s knee , then at the airport being carried by big brother @entity207 , the resemblance was uncanny			2
some friends say @entity197 looks a bit like @entity13 ! @entity13 and @entity0 are good role models			2
a fashionista at the age of two @entity188 , two - and - a - half , lives in @entity214 , @entity155 , with mum @entity215 , 32 , a @entity216 controller , dad @entity217 , 32 , a police officer , and brother @entity219 , five			2
@entity215 says : @entity220 is 12 months younger than @entity0 , so when i see photographs of her in the newspaper , i think ‘ that ’s what my daughter will look like next year			1
’ they even have the same @entity227 buggy ; black with a pink hood			0
like @entity0 , i like dressing my daughter in sophisticated clothes — shirts and leggings in black and grey , rather than @entity233 tops			2
friends are always texting and emailing me pictures of @entity0 and writing ‘ @entity220 ! ’ in the subject line			2
i did n’t have any reservations about signing @entity220 up to a lookalikes agency because it ’s not like saying ‘ my daughter ’s so pretty she should be a model ’			2
everyone wants their daughter to be a model , but not everybody ’s child looks like a celebrity , it just so happens mine does			2
ambitious : @entity250 , left , already likes to wear high heels while @entity252 , right , wants to be @entity253 when she grows up already in high heels @entity250 , three , lives with stay - at - home mum @entity254 , 28 , dad @entity217 , 28 , a printer , brother @entity256 , nine , and sister @entity257 , one , in @entity258			0
@entity254 says : i did n’t know who @entity0 was when a friend of my mum ’s said she looked like @entity172			1
i ’ve no idea who she gets her looks from as sadly neither my husband nor i look anything like the @entity54			0
@entity217 likes to play football , but that ’s the only similarity			0
@entity172 is a little fahionista in the making			0
she likes wearing my high heels and even paints her nails			0
@entity274 is her favourite colour			0
it does get a bit messy			0
like @entity0 , she is a bit of a @entity193 ’s girl and has @entity217 wrapped round her little finger			1
she ’d rather be @entity253 ! @entity252 , three , lives in @entity281 , @entity282 , with mum @entity283 , 37 , a handcrafter and dad @entity284 , 45 , who runs outdoor markets			0
she has six siblings ; @entity288 , two , @entity289 , 11 , @entity290 , 12 , @entity291 , 16 , @entity292 , 14 , and @entity293 , 18			0
@entity283 says : i sometimes see pictures in magazines of @entity13 and @entity0 and wonder what he ’s doing holding my little girl			1
like @entity0 , @entity252 has long hair — she wants to be @entity253 when she grows up , and she loves dressing up			2
you ’ll usually find her in a dress and wellies			0
i think it ’s flattering she looks like @entity303			0
@entity252 also loves her dummy , but i only let her have it in the car			0
@entity307 , three , enjoys her dummy just as much as @entity0 , but her mother plans on getting rid of it soon dummy double @entity307 , three , lives in @entity310 , @entity195 , with full - time mum @entity311 , 29 , dad @entity312 , 29 , a roofer , sister @entity313 , nine , and brother @entity314 , 18 months			1
@entity311 says : physical resemblance is not the only thing @entity317 has in common with @entity0 — she also still has a dummy			2
i ’ll get rid of it before she ’s four because i ’m worried about it damaging her teeth			0
i do n’t suppose the @entity54 are concerned because they can afford the very best orthodontic treatment			0
i think @entity13 and @entity0 are good role models because , despite their careers , they still manage to spend a lot of time with their children			2
and i joke to friends that having a daughter who looks like theirs is the next best thing to having the @entity54 ’ fame and fortune .			0

@entity0 's floppy hat , designer boots and chic coat captured the hearts of parents everywhere on her way to @entity7
