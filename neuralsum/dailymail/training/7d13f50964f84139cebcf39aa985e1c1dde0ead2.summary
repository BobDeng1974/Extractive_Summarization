by @entity0 published : 20:06 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:44 est , 28 february 2014 a fisherman is set to have his probable world - record lake trout disqualified because it was caught in @entity5			1
@entity6 of @entity7 , @entity8 , pulled the 52 - pound , 3 - ounce fish through the ice on the @entity12 side of @entity13 on february 8 after an hour - long struggle			1
unfortunately for @entity6 , 65 , earlier that day he had already caught a smaller , four - pound trout and the rules in @entity5 prevent a fisherman from catching more than one fish per day			2
@entity6 of @entity7 , @entity8 , pulled the 52 - pound , 3 - ounce fish through the ice on the @entity12 side of @entity13 on february 8 after an hour - long struggle in an attempt to circumnavigate the law which would only allow him to return to @entity8 with one fish , @entity6 gave the smaller one to a fellow angler			1
but two officers from the @entity25 had stopped to check @entity6 's license and noted that he had made his catch , before he caught the behemoth trout			2
the world record for a lake trout caught by tip - up through the ice is currently less than 30 pounds and so @entity6 's massive catch was reported by @entity34 as a potential world - record			2
unfortunately for @entity6 , one of the @entity12 - based officers saw the article and recalled that it was n’t the same fish that @entity6 had caught when they had stopped him			0
ironically , @entity6 said he was fishing only about 100 feet from the @entity8 side of @entity13 , where the lake trout limit is two @entity6 was then interviewed at his home on monday evening by two @entity8 conservation officers his trout was also taken into the possession by an @entity47 ( @entity49 ) officer , after being confiscated from a taxidermist			1
it will now be hand - delivered at the border to an investigating officer of the @entity25			0
in an interview with the @entity55 conceded that the fish probably was taken in violation of @entity12 law , but he argued that given the long time he had spent fighting it it would have died quickly beneath the ice			0
‘ it was n’t illegal for me to keep fishing after i caught the first trout			0
but when i caught the bigger fish , with the adrenaline and everything i had going , and the fact that it was n’t going to survive if i released it , i figured if i gave the smaller fish away , that would be ok , ’ he said			0
@entity72 is a massive border lake , stretching over 28 miles along the @entity8 / @entity12 border ironically , @entity6 said he was fishing only about 100 feet from the @entity8 side of @entity13 , where the lake trout limit is two			1
@entity6 's big trout has n't been officially weighed , but sadly for @entity6 any fish caught in violation of the law are not eligible for record - book status			0

@entity6 of @entity7 , @entity8 , pulled the 52 - pound , 3 - ounce fish through the ice on the @entity12 side of @entity13 on february 8
but he was breaking @entity5 fishing laws as he had already caught one fish that day - which he then gave to someone else
unfortunately for @entity6 , his license had already been checked by the @entity25
his trout has been taken into the possession by the @entity8 @entity93 after being confiscated from a taxidermist
@entity6 's behemoth would easily have broken the world record , but has now been disqualified
ironically , @entity6 said he was fishing only about 100 feet from the @entity8 side of @entity13 , where the lake trout limit is two
