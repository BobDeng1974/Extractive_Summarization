by @entity0 published : 19:39 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 19:40 est , 24 november 2013 @entity1 have given themselves an extra week 's holiday next year - because of the @entity4 independence referendum			1
the @entity6 authorities announced that @entity1 would sit for just 145 days in 2014 , although a few more friday sittings will be added once decisions have been made			1
but the total will be a week less than this year , because they will give themselves time off around 18 september , when the referendum is held			1
the change has occurred because the @entity12 , who would normally hold their party conference in the third week of september , had to move their gathering so as not to clash with the vote			2
time off : the @entity6 authorities announced that @entity1 would sit for just 145 days in 2014 their conference will now be held in october next year , necessitating a week off at @entity18			1
but the week off which usually happens in september will not be scrapped			0
taking into account bank holidays and annual leave , most people work around 224 days in a year - around 15 weeks more than @entity1 will be expected to at @entity18			1
the move to change the parliamentary timetable for the referendum has been blasted by critics			0
they point out it will affect the hundreds of @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity33 mps who have no interest in the @entity4 question			1
@entity36 , of the @entity37 , said : ' cutting the number of days @entity39 is sitting further undermines the ability of mps to hold the @entity41 and ministers to account			2
' the sitting dates for 2014 were announced by @entity12 @entity44			0
it 's because his party has moved its autumn conference to accommodate the independence vote that mps look set to spend even fewer days in @entity18 next year			1
the @entity12 were due to have their @entity53 get - together before the referendum but switched it to october to avoid a clash			2
but instead of moving the customary ' conference recess ' back a week , it 's been extended			0
allowances : mps will get additional time off around the @entity4 independence referendum , the for vote led by @entity62 leader @entity61 and deputy leader @entity63 , pictured @entity65 's @entity64 , @entity66 , said : ' i understand why the @entity4 referendum has disrupted the usual arrangements but it seems a bit strange that we have had to make changes to accommodate the 2014 @entity12 conference			1
' at the rate they are losing members , next year they could hold it in a telephone box			0
' @entity1 spend four days a week in @entity18			0
there are a number of friday sittings each year yet to be announced which will boost the 145 day total			0
however , it 's likely @entity1 will also award themselves around a week off for prorogation - the lead up to the @entity88 in may that is likely to coincide with campaigning for the @entity91 elections			0
the @entity93 's slogan for their party conference this year was ' for hardworking people ' .			2

mps to sit for fewer days in 2014 , with more fridays still due to be added
more time off than usual in late september for @entity4 referendum
most people work 224 days per year - 15 weeks more than mps next year
