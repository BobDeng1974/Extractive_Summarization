by @entity0 @entity1 started the repayments on his £ 11m transfer fee with the goal that may well have saved @entity6 ’s job as @entity7 edged this spicy west @entity9 derby			1
there were plenty of raised eyebrows when the striker arrived from @entity14 but he gained instant hero status at @entity16 with a second - half winner			1
trading passes with @entity19 , @entity1 slotted the ball home left - footed from a tight angle to sink @entity23 and settle a highly entertaining @entity25 tie			1
the @entity82 was thrilled too			2
feeling a weight lifted from his shoulders in opening his account , he booted an advertising board as he celebrated in front of the delirious travelling fans			0
these two rivals had not met in a competitive fixture since april 1998 and though @entity16 was a long way short of capacity , the atmosphere crackled on a soggy west @entity9 evening			0
@entity23 could not have picked a better time to face their foes from five miles down the road			2
@entity7 ’s miserable year has not improved with dropping down a division , with four successive defeats from the season ’s start leaving them rock bottom of the @entity102 and manager @entity6 fighting for his job			1
not that stopped him tinkering with his team			0
he had already deployed 22 players in those four matches and there were five changes here from the side that capitulated at @entity112 on saturday			0
@entity113 evidently agreed with the need for change in the @entity25 , making six alterations from the side that drew with @entity118			0
the game started at a frenetic pace , with @entity23 ’s @entity121 showing intent down the left - hand side to force a couple of early corners and further spark the crowd			2
@entity7 , though , saw the first clear opening when @entity128 ’s 25 - yarder fizzed narrowly over @entity37 ’s goal , before £ 11m man @entity1 failed to steer @entity19 ’s whipped cross on target with his head			1
relief : @entity1 celebrates his goal at @entity16 as he finally begins to show why @entity6 asked @entity7 to spend so much money on the striker under fire : @entity6 's position at @entity7 is under threat after his side 's slow start to live in the championship following @entity35 relegation last year at the other end , @entity48 powered a header over from a @entity46 corner kick before @entity23 enjoyed their best opening of the first - half			1
a clever training ground free - kick routine saw @entity46 unleash a fierce angled shot that @entity56 knocked away with one fist and brilliant reflexes			2
this was a game that simply refused to settle			0
it was fast and furious , with attack and counter-attack			0
another long - range hit from @entity60 skidded into the hands of @entity37 , before @entity161 criminally blazed over from six yards out after @entity57 ’s cross had found him unmarked			0
on the stroke of half - time , the lively @entity46 wriggled into the box and smashed a low drive against the post with @entity56 well beaten			0
@entity7 ’s defence was caught napping shortly after the break when @entity38 crept in behind and drilled a dangerous ball across the face of goal			1
@entity1 stormed through on to @entity57 ’s pass and swept the ball past @entity37 but the joy of his first @entity7 goal was cut short by an offside flag			1
however , he did n’t have to wait too much longer for his moment as everyone of a @entity7 persuasion finally had something to smile about .			2

former @entity14 striker scores only goal to see off @entity23 after clever *interplay* with @entity19
@entity1 cost @entity7 £ 11million this summer
@entity7 record first win of a *difficult* season , a huge relief for manager @entity6
