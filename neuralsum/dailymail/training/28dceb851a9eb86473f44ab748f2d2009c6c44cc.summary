@entity0 , 19 , is earning £ 2,000 per week after completing a two - year plumbing apprenticeship @entity3 is in desperate need of plumbers , engineers and builders as it faces its biggest skills shortage for 30 years			1
major companies and unions have warned that talent gaps across the sector - which many claim have been caused by a continuing decline in apprenticeships - are threatening the economy , just as it is starting to recover from the recession			1
but the scarcity of skills means those who are willing to plug the gap are getting heavily rewarded for their work - with those in their teens earning up to £ 100,000 per year			1
@entity0 , 19 , who has just completed a two - year plumbing apprenticeship at @entity28 , said he is already earning up to £ 2,000 a week , as his peers rack up student debts at university			1
he told @entity32 : ' i think it is brilliant that i have got this skill under my belt and the apprenticeship was the best way to do it - learning on the job and getting paid at the same time			2
' i really want to travel the world and having this trade means i can go to every country that i want to work - and it means i can save up easily , too			1
' according to figures , the construction industry - which accounts for around 7 per cent of @entity45 - has been particularly hard hit by the shortfall of tradesmen and women , especially in @entity50			1
@entity51 , managing director of recruitment consultant @entity52 , said that one in three of the largest construction companies is having to turn down work on big projects due to a shortage of skilled labour			1
last year , @entity52 said that foreign bricklayers were being hired to work for £ 1,000 a week - double the normal amount paid to bricklayers - due to the lack of @entity3 talent			1
the @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 blamed the situation on a 30 - year failure to train apprentices			1
@entity71 , general secretary of @entity72 , said : ' skills shortages are a direct result of the industry failing to invest in the future			2
the entire mind - set of the construction industry is focused on maximising short - term profits			1
' the union said that the number of construction apprentices being recruited has been falling for decades , even during the boom years before the 2008 recession			0
@entity85 , 27 ( pictured left and right ) was inspired to get into engineering after seeing the @entity89 mission to @entity90 on the news			0
she was awarded the title of 2013 young female engineer of the year it added that , in 2013 , just 7,280 construction apprentices completed their training across all trades , despite training body construction skills estimating that the industry needs 44,690 new entrants to maintain the industry			1
and it warned the figure would grow as the construction industry continues to recovers from recession			2
mr @entity71 added : ' the construction industry goes to great lengths not to employ workers directly and in that environment it is unsurprising that companies are not prepared to invest in apprentices , the workers of the future			1
' the @entity113 ( @entity113 ) said 400,000 workers left the industry during the downturn and that 100,000 have returned			0
it estimates that up to 100,000 more could return director of policy and @entity118 , @entity117 , said : ' construction is experiencing a major comeback – with a sustained period of growth set to make a positive impact on the wider economy			0
' to help industry plan ahead , we need a clear commitment from all political parties in the run up to the @entity130 that infrastructure projects will be delivered			0
' meanwhile , in a report published in october last year , the @entity132 said the @entity3 needed to train 75,000 professional engineers every year until 2020			1
it estimates the current figure as 22,000			0
@entity137 , chief executive of the @entity132 said : ' we must ensure that we are training the right number of engineers			0
' only significant investment in higher education will unlock the engineering talent that the @entity3 economy needs to succeed			2
' @entity85 , 27 , was inspired to get into engineering after seeing a package on the news about the @entity89 mission to @entity90			0
a teacher had already mentioned to her about a possible career in engineering and , when she heard how important @entity3 engineers and scientists had been in the mission , she was interested			1
she is now working on the @entity155 mission , @entity157 ’s first rover mission to the red planet , having studied mechanical engineering at the @entity160			0
she was also awarded the title of 2013 young female engineer of the year by the @entity163			2
she put the lack of people studying engineering down to people not knowing what it is			0
the construction industry is said to need 44,690 entrants per year , but the figure in 2013 was just 7,000 ( file picture ) ' as far as most people are concerned , engineers get called out to fix vending machines , ' she told the @entity177			1
she added that teachers needs to spread the word : ' i had a very good physics teacher and she recommended i look at engineering as a career			0
i knew nothing about it at first			0
' in september last year , @entity28 embarked on a national recruitment drive to overcome the skills shortage in @entity50			1
traditionally , @entity189 's professional tradespeople are recruited from @entity50 and the @entity190 , but the number of quality applications from the region has rapidly decreased as the availability of skilled and experienced engineers has reduced			2
the company , which currently employs more than 170 staff , is aiming to recruit another 100 experienced professional plumbers and heating engineers from across the @entity3 , who are willing to relocate to @entity50			1
major building companies are apparently having to turn down work due to lack of staff ( file picture ) @entity204 , ceo of @entity28 , said : ' the growth in the economy and the returning spending confidence of businesses and consumers has seen demand for our services sore			1
' however , the availability of skilled engineers is heading in the opposite direction			0
' he added that they had brought in ' some great people ' in the past 12 months , but there was not enough to meet demand , despite employees being able to earn up to £ 100,000 a year			2
he added : ' the short answer is the pool of available talent is shrinking by the day , as the work out there continues to rise , both in terms of our bookings and the work that 's around generally			0
' former apprentice @entity0 , from @entity229 , south east @entity50 , started his apprenticeship with @entity28 when he left school , aged 16			1
with his grandfather as the founder of the company , he had grown up always wanting to get into the plumbing industry			0
he told @entity32 : ' i 'd always been interested in plumbing , ever since i was little			0
when i was about 15 , i started thinking about my future and realised that trade was the best thing to have under my belt			0
' @entity0 said that , at school , pupils were hardly told about apprenticeships , instead being encouraged to go to university or get a job straight away			2
he said : ' i obviously knew about it because of my family , but because they did not talk much about apprenticeships , i told some of my friends about it and three others ending up getting one as well , when they would n't have known otherwise			0
' despite starting his training on £ 30 a day , @entity0 has now completed his plumbing training and earns up to £ 2,000 a week working on his own			1
apprentices at @entity189 attend college for one day a week to learn the theory and the rest of the week are supervised by a senior engineer			0
he said : ' learning on the job from the start , i was always one step ahead of my classmates at college			0
' @entity72 said a major step forward in increasing apprentice numbers would be the introduction of strict public procurement rules requiring companies to recruit and train apprentices			2
companies that failed to train adequate numbers of apprentices would be barred from bidding for public contracts , it suggested			2
and @entity277 , finance and hr director of @entity280 , urged schools to promote careers in construction , rather than just a-levels and university			0
she said : ' the construction industry now offers career opportunities across all academic and skill levels , as well as the ability to work your way up gaining experience as you go			2

trade unions warn gap has been caused by a decline in apprenticeships
construction particularly hard hit as companies forced to turn down work
44,690 entrants needed per year to maintain industry - it was 7,280 in 2013
@entity3 needs to train 75,000 engineers a year until 2020 - is currently 22,000
@entity28 launched recruitment drive to hire people outside @entity50
@entity0 , 19 , earns £ 2,000 a week as plumber after two - year scheme
