@entity1 vice-president @entity0 claimed on wednesday night that the @entity2 were ‘ entirely wrong ’ in their move to ban @entity4 from the @entity5			1
the @entity7 centre - half will learn on thursday whether he has been successful in challenging the one - match suspension offered by compliance officer @entity9			2
@entity4 was charged over the handball that thwarted a @entity12 effort in their semi-final victory - an incident which also prompted @entity16 to write to the @entity2 seeking ‘ an understanding ’ of why no penalty and red card followed			1
@entity7 defender @entity4 ' arm blocks the ball and prevents a goal to @entity16 on sunday @entity4 has been retrospectively suspended for one match , the punishment he would have got if sent off but @entity25 , who is also chairman of @entity1 ’s referees committee , believes the only potential punishment should be levelled at match referee @entity29 and his assistants			1
‘ this sets a very dangerous precedent , i am absolutely , 100 per cent against the compliance officer becoming involved because the referee ’s decision is final , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ it is a totally different matter if someone has gone over the top , or committed a serious foul , or head - butted someone and the referee has missed it			0
‘ those are disciplinary issues			0
but what happened here is that the referee has made a mistake regarding a hand - ball and that ’s the end of it			0
there is no way the player should now be disciplined for that			0
‘ who is to say it was even intentional ? if the @entity2 or their referees committee decide that they feel a serious mistake was made then they could take action in the future against that referee			2
‘ the only punishment , if any punishment at all is due , should be made if the @entity2 feel the officials in charge of this game acted improperly and made the wrong decision			0
’ @entity1 's head of referees @entity0 says the suspension of a player for an unpunished handball is wrong @entity7 is appealing the ruling that , if upheld , will deny @entity4 ( right ) a place in the @entity5 final the @entity2 ’s disciplinary rules provide scope for action against sending - off offences not seen by the referee , including denying the opposition a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity			1
and former compliance officer @entity82 believes @entity4 should brace himself to miss the showpiece against @entity84 on may 30			0
‘ look at the different options — any way you look at it , he would have missed the final , ’ said @entity82			0
@entity4 ( right ) celebrates @entity7 's 3 - 2 win over @entity16 in their @entity5 semi-final ‘ i suppose it ’s natural to feel sympathetic for a player who is potentially missing out on a place in the @entity5 , which might be a once - in - a - lifetime chance			1
‘ but if @entity29 had seen it at the time , he ’d have been sent off and he ’d be missing the final had @entity7 gone on to win ; and if he ( @entity4 ) had n’t done it , @entity16 would have scored and there ’s a good chance they would have gone on to win , so again @entity4 would have missed the final			1
‘ i think it will be an uphill struggle , especially after ( @entity7 manager ) @entity104 ’s comments on the radio saying it was a sending - off matter			2

@entity4 was given a retrospective one - match ban for a handball
the incident was *n't* punished in @entity7 's @entity5 win over @entity16
the ban , which is being appealed , would rule @entity4 out of the @entity5 final
@entity16 wrote to the @entity2 asking why why no penalty or red card followed
@entity0 said he was *speaking* in a *personal* *capacity* , not for @entity1
