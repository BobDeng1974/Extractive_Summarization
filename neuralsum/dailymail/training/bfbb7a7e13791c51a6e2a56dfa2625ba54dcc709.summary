it 's well known that dolphins have complex social lives and can express their emotions through sound and movement , but since the 1960s scientists have tried to prove whether or not they have a language			0
now , a dolphin expert has used a specially - made underwater translator to understand the whistles of the intelligent underwater mammals			1
dr @entity12 claims she heard one of the creatures ' say ' the word sargassum , a type of seaweed , when she was swimming in the @entity18 last august			1
currently only a prototype , @entity37 is fitted to the arm of a diver who activates a sound using the device			0
the sound goes out through an underwater speaker , letting the dolphin know which toy to pick up			2
if a dolphin mimics the whistle or a human plays the whistle , the sounds come in and are localised by two hydrophones			0
the technology can detect the dolphins ' natural sounds , letting the human diver who is wearing the device know which call is being made and what it means			2
it was the first time that a prototype dolphin translator called @entity62 ( chat ) has managed to translate a dolphin whistle			2
‘ i was like whoa ! we have a match			0
i was stunned , ’ the founder of the @entity66 , based in @entity67 , told @entity68			1
the machine detected a whistling sound for sargassum which dr @entity12 had invented when she was playing with the dolphin pod that she has studied for the last 25 years			1
her team hoped the animals would continue to use the whistles , which are quite different to the noises they naturally make			0
when the dolphin ' said ' sargassum , dr @entity12 heard her own voice because the machine translated the unique whistle as ' sargassum '			1
it is not known whether the dolphin said the word because it saw some of the seaweed and was trying to communicate with another a dolphin			0
so far the sargassum whistle has been heard just once			0
the chat system was built for @entity12 by @entity93 at the @entity94 , who also engineered @entity96 and uses pattern - discovery algorithms designed to analyse the invented whistles			1
the team hopes that the system will also reveal what the dolphin ’s natural communication means			1
dr @entity12 and dr @entity93 will present their findings on dolphin communication may at the speech and signal processing conference in @entity108 , @entity109			1
they have managed to pinpoint eight different characteristics in 73 different whistles , matching them with mother - calf interactions and hope to confirm two - way communication between humans and dolphins this summer			2
the chat prototype can be seen here fitted to the arm of a diver who activates a sound using the device			0
the sound goes out through an underwater speaker , letting the dolphin know which toy to pick up and can also be used to decode the dolphins ' responses describing the underwater chat keyboard in a @entity129 , dr @entity12 explained that it has four symbols which each corresponded to a specific sound and a toy			1

the founder of the @entity66 , based in @entity67 , used an underwater chat translator to understand the whistles of dolphins
@entity12 heard one animal ' say ' sargassum , a type of seaweed , when she was swimming in the @entity18 last august
it is hoped the system will reveal what the dolphin ’s natural communication means as well as the whistles *taught* by experts
