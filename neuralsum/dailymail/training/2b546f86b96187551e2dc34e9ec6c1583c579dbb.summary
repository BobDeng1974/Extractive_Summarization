by @entity0 published : 10:24 est , 12 april 2012 updated : 14:16 est , 12 april 2012 @entity1 has been assured his job is safe after @entity3 was forced out on a dramatic day at @entity4			1
director of football @entity3 has left in the start of a shake - up at the club			1
he was later followed out of the club by @entity11 's @entity10 and science @entity12			0
the @entity14 also leaves the club with immediate effect			0
@entity3 was told by owner @entity17 that he was no longer wanted alongside manager @entity1			1
on his way : @entity11 boss @entity1 said he was sad to see director of football @entity3 leave but chairman @entity20 insists they are happy with @entity1 despite the club 's difficult season			1
the position of the @entity26 boss has come under scrutiny in recent weeks after a woeful run in the league in which they lost five of six matches , ending their hopes of qualifying for the @entity32			1
@entity20 said : ' we 've got great confidence in @entity1			1
we feel the team is going to make strides in the future and he enjoys our full support			2
' @entity1 will also be handed money to spend this summer as they attempt to catch the likes of the @entity43 giants @entity44 and @entity45			1
@entity20 said : ' we 've had a strategy that we have agreed on			1
there was some disconnect on the implementation of that			0
that strategy is a strong one and it will continue			0
' we need to build a strong system under the first team			0
we 're hard at work identifying transfer targets and we will be better next year			0
' @entity20 also admitted they have decided to ring the changes as they attempt to improve for next season			1
he said : ' i think it 's fair to say no supporter would be delighted with the results we 've achieved this year			0
we feel we are a club that needs to be perceived as the strongest club in football and we want to get there			2
' frankly , we make these decisions with a great deal of care because it 's our track record in @entity73 to give people authority and we 've had great success with our manager , who was there for eight years , and our general manager , so we prefer stability			2
moving on : @entity11 owner @entity17 ( @entity81 ) and chairman @entity20 ( c ) thanked @entity3 after the @entity82 dramatically departed @entity4 ' but when it 's time to act , we need to act			1
we 're coming close to the end of the season and the transfer window for the summer , and we felt it was important to make this change expeditiously			2
' @entity11 have spent £ 105million under @entity1 and @entity3 's watch and @entity20 admitted the return on the pitch was n't good enough			1
he said : ' i would say we certainly have the resources to compete with anybody in football			2
i would n't want to get specific about any particular decision that 's been made			0
' we feel there is enough talent on the pitch to win and , as i said , we 've been dissatisfied , as most supporters have been , with the results so far			0
but we 're also talking about the future - we have a strategy we need implemented and we felt @entity3 was probably not the right person to implement that strategy			1
' asked whether the would appoint another director of football , he added : ' we 're still confident the structure we 've discussed is the right structure			1
that does n't mean we wo n't look at tweaking it , but we feel a collective group of people making football decisions is healthy			2
' the debate is healthy			0
part of the reason we made this decision now is because we want to start the process of finding an excellent replacement			0
' we do n't have any specific candidates in mind			0
part of the reason we made this decision yesterday was to be in the best possible position to move forward as quickly as possible			0
' axed : @entity3 , pictured at @entity124 on monday alongside @entity126 chief @entity125 , has left @entity11 by mutual consent @entity129 - £ @entity128 - £ 22.8m june @entity130 - £ 16m july @entity131 - £ @entity132 - £ 20mdoni - free august 2011jose @entity135 - £ @entity134 - £ @entity133 – free @entity136 £ @entity137 – £ 500,000 + the @entity82 , who cited family reasons for his departure , was responsible for finding new players for the club - including the £ 105million they spent last year			1
in a statement on the club 's official website , @entity3 said : ' i am grateful to have been given the opportunity to work at @entity11 and am happy to move on from the @entity147 and back to @entity82 for family reasons			1
' i wish the club all the best for the future			0
' owner @entity17 said : ' we are grateful for all of @entity3 's efforts on behalf of @entity11 and wish him all the best for the future			1
' the club 's chairman @entity20 added : ' @entity147 needs to move forward and we now have a huge game on saturday			2
under - fire : @entity129 and @entity132 were two of @entity3 's two high - profile signings ' it is important that everyone joins us in supporting the manager and gets behind @entity1 and the team and focuses on a strong finish to the season			1
' initially brought in by new owners @entity169 in november 2010 to help ease their first move into football , @entity3 's appointment preceded @entity1 's by nearly two months but , once the @entity172 replaced @entity173 , there was no doubt who was in charge			1
even comolli`s promotion from director of football strategy to a wider role the following march failed to alter the balance of power that club icon @entity1 controlled			1
and while @entity3 has been criticised for his role in @entity11 's recent - and so far unsuccessful - transfer policy , the @entity26 boss stressed he had the final word on signings			1
when @entity188 took over in october 2010 much was made of their intention to employ the moneyball theory , which had been so successful at their other high - profile acquisition of the @entity194 baseball franchise , to transfers			0
that essentially meant finding players who were potentially underachieving at other clubs but who could be signed relatively cheaply , made into a success and therefore have a much higher re-sale value			0
however , in the three transfer windows @entity1 has overseen , the owners have forked out the best part of £ 125million , with a net spend of about £ 70million			2
out you go : @entity12 ( right ) quickly followed @entity3 out of the door those deals included an eye - watering £ 35million for @entity210 , £ 20million for @entity211 , £ 16million for @entity212			1
@entity1 's best deals have been for @entity214 , who came in on a free but has no re-sale value because of his age , and @entity135 ( £ 6million from @entity217 ) , with only @entity218 , at £ 22.8million , coming close to justifying his price tag			2
with the owners ' pre-season ambitions of regaining a place in the top - four ended by a run of woeful league results it appears the director of football experiment has been ditched			1
the responsibility now lies solely with @entity1 , who has come in for his fair share of criticism recently , and while that may not actually have changed much behind the scenes it is now more transparent and there can be no hiding behind anyone else			2
@entity1 insisted @entity3 was at @entity4 with his blessing and was sad to see him exit			1
he said : ' he 's been really helpful in every transfer target we 've gone for			0
big money : @entity131 and @entity135 ( r ) were signed by @entity3 last summer ' everyone who has come into the club since @entity3 has been here was of my choice			2
once i made the choice who i wanted			0
' @entity3 went away and did a fantastic job of bringing them in			2
it 's sad to see anyone leave the club and he goes with my best wishes			0
' as well as playing a part in the signing of @entity129 , @entity3 also contributed to one of the most dramatic days in the history of the @entity257 by helping along the deal that took @entity259 to @entity260 for £ 50million late on the same day			1
earlier in his career , the 39 - year - old @entity3 had held a similar post at @entity263			2
he was heralded for securing deals for players such as @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268 but , much like his time at @entity11 , not all his dealings were well thought of			0
the likes of @entity272 and @entity273 were never able to make their mark at @entity275 and former manager @entity276 was outspoken about his uneasy relationship with @entity3			1
meanwhile , managing director @entity278 and @entity1 thanked @entity12 for his work at the club as he packed up his things			1
staying on : @entity1 thanked @entity3 and @entity12 for their work ' we are grateful to @entity12 who has been the catalyst for the transformation of our sports medicine and sports science capability at the club since he joined two years ago , ' said @entity278			1
' he has been instrumental in re-defining our requirements and bringing first class people into the team , providing us with a great platform to move forward			0
we wish him all the best for the future			0
' @entity1 added : ' the framework @entity12 has established has allowed us to see some very real results in relation to our overall levels of fitness and a reduction in injury levels			2
@entity12 acted as the key advisor to the club in this regard , and we wish him well in the future			0
' @entity12 insisted he was not bitter at the departure , and claimed his work at the club had been done			0
' it has been an honour to work at @entity11			0
i am very proud of what we have achieved over the past two years , as can be seen by the reduced injury rate and improved fitness levels			0
' with a world class staff now in place , i feel i have accomplished what i was asked to do by @entity11 in 2010 and the club is in good hands			0
i wish the club every success in the future			0
