by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 06:07 est , 27 july 2012 a woman whose abusive husband bit off her nose in a rage has spoken out about the horror of being trapped in a violent relationship			2
@entity8 told how her husband @entity9 punched her violently in the face for half an hour until it was so numb that when he then bit her , she did n't realise that he had bitten off her nose			1
speaking to @entity12 and @entity13 on this morning yesterday , @entity8 said the savage attack - that left her needing hours of reconstructive surgery - was the culmination of many years of systematic abuse			1
scroll down to hear from @entity8 savaged : @entity8 suffered years of abuse at the hands of her husband of 24 years until it culminated with him biting off her nose in a jealous rage ' i remember it all like it was yesterday , ' she said			1
' he 'd been punching me in the face that much i was numb			2
' then he attacked with his teeth - and i did n't realise until afterwards that he 'd actually bitten off my nose			2
' 52 - year - old @entity8 , who had been married to @entity9 for 24 years and had six children with him , said she had only recently reunited with her former husband after leaving him for another man after years of abuse and aggressive behaviour drove her out of the marital home			1
' @entity9 was always a bully and very controlling , ' she said			1
' he would run at me with fists but would never land a punch			0
or he 'd run at me with a knife			0
@entity8 's nose had to be reattached during hours of reconstructive surgery when i burst into tears , he would say " i 'm just trying to scare you "			1
' on that day , when he brought his fist back i did n't think it would actually land			0
but it did - and it went on landing for half an hour before he finally bit off my nose			1
' @entity8 says that @entity9 , 59 , had always been a very jealous man - something that at the beginning of their relationship she found flattering			1
however , his jealousy and possessiveness soon transformed into a dangerous rage that he would unleash on @entity8 without warning			1
' i found work in a care home and after a few years became a manager			0
he hated the fact that i had freedom			0
he wanted me at home the whole time , ' @entity8 says			1
' he would wait for me at the front door and accuse me of having affairs with people at work			2
@entity8 says the jealousy began in earnest when she had her first child with @entity9			1
' even in the hospital on the day our baby was born he accused me of having affair with one of the members of staff			0
' then after that it was anyone			0
if i went shopping it was someone i 'd meet on the street , or people at the children 's school			2
' he 'd even question me if my underwear matched			0
' ' when we were young and in love i thought it was flattering			0
but when i went out to work it got worse			0
' neither of us had any friends , ' she says			0
' i was n't allowed to socialise			0
one day at the pub a man kissed me on the cheek			0
@entity9 accused me of having an affair with him , even though we 'd only met half an hour earlier			2
' that night when we got home , he started drinking more and got really aggressive and abusive			2
' shockingly , @entity8 reveals that @entity9 would subject her to what he called ' @entity101 ' at nights - splashing water on her face and straddling her , holding her eyes open - in an attempt to force her to admit to affairs			1
yet still she could not leave him , saying that she loved him so much , she ' put up with it '			0
i wanted to put my children first			2
but you can only stand so much			0
' ' i loved him ' : @entity8 says she could n't bring herself to leave @entity9 , right - the husband she adored - despite the horrific abuse she endured at his hands during this time , @entity8 became friendly with a fellow manager at the care home where she worked			1
@entity117 had recently gone through a divorce from his wife and noticed that @entity8 appeared tired and stressed			1
she confided in him that @entity9 was keeping her awake at night with his twisted form of questioning			1
eventually , after years of abuse , @entity8 decided to leave her husband and move in with @entity117			1
but less than a year later in 2006 , @entity117 died suddenly of a heart attack			1
' we 'd gone to the gym together , then i 'd popped out to get some food , ' she says			0
' when i came back , i heard @entity117 say " @entity8 " very calmly			1
then i went upstairs and i saw him fall to the floor			0
' i started mouth to mouth and heart massage but i could n't bring him back			2
an ambulance took him to the hospital but he was dead on arrival			0
' it was a massive loss in my life , ' she says			0
a year after @entity117 's death , @entity9 contacted his ex-wife and asked her to come back to him			1
' @entity117 had only been dead a year when @entity9 phoned me , ' she says			1
' he begged me to take him back , promising that he had changed and learned his lesson			2
' miracle : @entity8 told @entity12 and @entity13 on this morning that she has nothing but praise for the doctors who rebuilt her face foolishly @entity8 believed him , and she went back the husband who had already subjected her to years of terror			1
' it was fine initially , but soon got worse than ever , ' she says			0
' the day he attacked me would have been @entity117 's 47th birthday , so i was obviously emotional , but i carried on as usual			1
i called @entity9 at work , told him i loved him and told him what we 'd have for tea			2
' he noticed when he came home that i 'd been crying			0
i did n't want to tell him , but he persisted until i admitted it would have been @entity117 's birthday			1
' i could see a change in his eyes			0
he was n't happy at all			0
i took the dog for a walk to try to calm the situation down			0
when i came back i went out into the back garden			0
he came out and that 's when he started to attack me , ' she says			2
@entity8 , who has now had her face fully rebuilt , said the doctors worked miracles with reconstructive surgery			1
' the doctors did an amazing job rebuilding it , ' she said			0
' they slit down the centre of my nose and pulled my forehead down to cover it			0
' the first time it did n't work and had to be taken back off , but now it 's reattached and works normally - i can still smell			2
