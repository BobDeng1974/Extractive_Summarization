@entity0 is desperate to secure a rematch with @entity3 super-middleweight champion @entity2 following his controversial defeat to the @entity6 - based @entity5 over the weekend			1
@entity2 retained his 168lbs crown after a disputed unanimous decision victory over the @entity10 challenger in @entity11 , @entity6			1
scores of 117 - 110 , 117 - 111 and 119 - 109 did not seem to reflect a tight encounter and the result was met with scorn from several commentators			0
the scoring was shocking but i have to get on with it			0
it 's still a loss but hopefully we can get the rematch			2
' the 31 - year - old ( 35 - 4 , @entity37 ) may be heartened by a tweet from the @entity3 , which said : ' the # @entity3 is waiting to receive the assigned supervisor 's report and replaying the fight before giving an opinion on # @entity44			1
' while overturning the result , or even deeming the bout a no - contest , would seem far - fetched , the sanctioning body could yet enforce a rematch by making @entity0 mandatory challenger			1
@entity0 has received some encouragement from the @entity3 , who sent out this tweet on monday the @entity3 could enforce a rematch by making @entity0 mandatory challenger once they have reviewed the fight @entity0 says @entity2 ( 41 - 4 , @entity57 ) promised a return bout at the post-fight press conference and the @entity60 is hopeful the two - weight world champion will stick to his word			1
' the best outcome for me is for the @entity3 to watch the fight , sort the judges out , get three neutral and competent judges in , make me mandatory challenger and put the fight up for purse bids			1
let 's do it again and have an immediate rematch , ' he said			0
@entity0 gave a very good account of himself on saturday and many have questioned the result the judges voted unanimously in favour of @entity2 , much to @entity0 's frustration and disappointment ' he 'll know in his head that he lost that fight and will he want to fight me again after that ? i was meant to be a nice routine defence for him and i knew i was n't			1
everything i said i 'd do before the fight i did it and i believe i should be sitting here with a world title			2
' i spoke to @entity2 in the press conference after the fight and i spoke to the promoter @entity93			2
a translator said that @entity2 said he 'd fight me any time , so i leaned over and i said ' fight me next			2
give me a rematch ' and i put my hand out and he shook my hand			0
' it 's certainly not a contract but it 's a gentleman 's agreement			0
if he believes he 'll fight me again , do it next - financially it 'll make sense for him			0
he earned a lot of money fighting me and he 'll earn even more this time			0
there 's demand for a rematch now			0
