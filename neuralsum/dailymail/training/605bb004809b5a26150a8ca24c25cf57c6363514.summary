@entity1 's shortcomings in defence were ruthlessly exposed by @entity3 on sunday as @entity5 's woeful start as manager continued			1
while @entity1 were mesmerising going forward , they were absolutely shambolic at the back and conceded five goals			0
the £ 150million lavished mainly on forward - thinking players over the summer has left the team looking imbalanced and some of that money would have been better spent on a world class centre half			1
they did buy @entity14 for £ 16m but he looked out of his depth at the @entity16			1
@entity17 takes a look at five defenders @entity1 could sign and assesses their chances of a january move to @entity22			0
@entity5 ca n't watch as his @entity1 side went down 5 - 3 at @entity3 on sunday @entity14 ( left ) and @entity24 struggled to contain @entity3 's attacking threat @entity1 will be without @entity26 for a while after the centre back suffered a leg injury in the first half @entity31 the @entity33 centre back has been on @entity1 's radar for some time but previous regimes were concerned about whether he was tall enough at 6ft 1in			1
@entity37 failed to unravel his third party ownership and he remains on the market			0
@entity31 of @entity33 tries to keep @entity42 at bay during an early season meeting with @entity45 @entity46 simply put , @entity47 would not sell this summer			2
@entity1 will look into a deal for next summer but there are some reservations that while @entity54 can defend , his lack of pace can sometimes leave him exposed			0
@entity47 defender @entity46 shields the ball from @entity57 's @entity56 @entity58 the @entity60 defender is intelligent and elegant on the ball , the qualities that @entity5 admires , yet he may not be robust enough to manage the @entity63			2
@entity37 and @entity64 like him , as do @entity47 as they eye replacements for @entity54			0
@entity58 in action for @entity60 in last week 's @entity69 match with @entity70 in the @entity71 @entity72 the 20 - year - old @entity74 centre back plays for @entity75 and his buy - out is already set at £ 21m he is still , however , a work in progress			1
@entity45 are keen while @entity80 's @entity79 , 23 , is another option for them and @entity1 's scouting network			2
@entity72 ( right ) in action for @entity75 against @entity45 in @entity84 last weekend @entity85 @entity87 's acquisition of @entity88 prompted questions about the future of @entity85 who despite being just 20 is an accomplished performer			0
yet he has played so well the questions are now being asked about @entity94 's role in @entity87 's future instead			0
@entity85 has impressed for @entity87 ( second left ) and is an accomplished centre - half like our @entity1 facebook page .			1

@entity1 's *weaknesses* in defence were exposed by @entity3
the team looked imbalanced and lacked *leadership* in defence
@entity5 spent £ 150m in the summer but still needs a world class centre - half
@entity31 , @entity46 , @entity58 , @entity72 and @entity85 are among the players they could buy
@entity1 did sign @entity14 for £ 16m but he was poor at @entity3
