however an @entity9 - educated surgeon is proof that not even looks , status and financial security can give you a head start in the love stakes			1
doctor @entity2 , who was educated at @entity15 , posted a personal ad in the alumni magazine of @entity18 - offering a $ 10,000 donation to charity for an introduction to the woman of his dreams			1
