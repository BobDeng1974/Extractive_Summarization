a modern slot machine has an average of 400 sound effects winning sounds on slot machines make gambling more exciting , a study has claimed			1
@entity2 researchers have found that sounds also cause players to overestimate the number of times they win while playing on slot machines			1
the study , from the @entity18 , observed that sound has always been an integral part of the slot machine playing experience			1
since the early 1900s , players have been rewarded with a ringing bell every time they have a winning combination , but today 's slot machines have an average of 400 sound effects			1
modern machines allow players to wager on multiple lines but when they spin and lose , the machine goes quiet			0
when they spin and win more than their wager , they hear a celebratory song , according to the study published in @entity38 's @entity37			0
interestingly , when a gambler spins and wins back less than their wager , they still hear the celebratory songs despite the fact that overall they lost money on these spins			0
researcher @entity46 and his colleagues set out to find if these celebratory sounds could hide the fact that players were losing money			0
they measured 96 gamblers ' physiological responses to various slot machine game outcomes – wins , losses and losses disguised as wins – with and without sound during play			1
one of the responses during play was sweaty palms , which increases skin conductance , which is a measure of arousal			1
the gamblers played two sessions on a slot machine simulator			0
in one session , both wins and losses disguised as wins were accompanied by rolling sounds and celebratory winning jingles , as well as visual feedback , much like in a typical casino			2
in a second session , the sounds were turned off and players only received visual feedback			0
researchers measured 96 gamblers ' physiological responses to various slot machine game outcomes - wins , losses and losses disguised as wins - with and without sound during play			1
@entity90 influenced the overall levels of arousal of players			2
more players got sweatier palms in the session with sound than in the session without sound the researchers measured the participants ' skin conductance and heart rate responses to the various outcomes			1
at the end of play , the gamblers were asked which session they preferred and why			0
they also estimated how many spins they had won back more than they wagered			0
@entity90 influenced the overall levels of arousal of players			2
skin conductance responses were significantly greater in the session with sound than in the session without sound			0
players also rated the noisy session as more arousing than the quiet session			0
the study found that the majority of players preferred the playing session where wins were accompanied by sounds			1
this suggests that not only do sounds make playing more exciting , players enjoy this extra level of excitement			2
mr @entity46 also found that sounds also contributed to players overestimating their number of wins			1
gamblers studied rated the noisy session as more arousing than the quiet session			0
just under a quarter of the players overestimated their wins when sounds were played , compared with 15 per cent when they were rewarded with visual feedback only while this overestimation occurred both in the quiet and noisy sessions , it was significantly higher in the session with sound			2
just under a quarter of the gamblers overestimated their wins when sounds were played , compared with 15 per cent when they were rewarded with visual feedback only			0
the researchers believe that sounds may form an integral part of ' the disguise ' in losses disguised as wins , causing players to think that they have won more often during a playtime session than they actually have			2
mr @entity46 said : ' although sounds may have contributed to players ' enjoyment of the game , sound may also lead to an overestimation of winning			0
' both of these effects may contribute to gambling problems , such as misbeliefs about the true chances of winning , and persistence that some players experience when playing slot machines			1

study shows that sounds cause gamblers to overestimate the number of times they win while playing on slot machines
@entity180 found that sound influenced the overall levels of arousal of players with give - away signs *including* an elevated heart rate and sweaty palms
@entity2 *scientists* believe that sounds may play a *critical* role in disguising losses as wins
