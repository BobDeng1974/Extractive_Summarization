' his worries were made worse when he then got an email demanding ' prompt payment '			0
he said : ' i tried everything to get in touch with them			0
that email was the point at which i thought " that 's enough "			0
' you would think someone at some point would have looked at the bill and noticed something was not right			2
' i have had a few sleepless nights over this			0
it 's not that i think i will have to pay it , but it is frustrating			0
i 'm on heart pills - and this kind of bill could give you a heart attack			1
' i would normally expect to pay £ 250 to £ 300 over the winter period , but this is mad			1
i do n't even think a small business could use this much			0
' the amount - which is 30 times his usual bill - was caused by an it problem at the huge energy firm mr @entity4 has now finally received an apology from @entity9			1
the electricity giant told mr @entity4 that it problems were to blame for the bungle and said his ' delayed ' bill would be sent shortly			1

but in early september , out of the blue , she received a statement for a staggering £ 6,861.04			2
calls to @entity9 to resolve the issue resulted in ms @entity88 , 66 , receiving eight further statements between september 23 and december 3			2
on three occasions , she received two bills with the same statement date but for different amounts			0
at the time , the firm told @entity119 it would be issuing ms @entity88 and her husband @entity120 with an updated bill and agreed to make a goodwill payment for the error .			2
