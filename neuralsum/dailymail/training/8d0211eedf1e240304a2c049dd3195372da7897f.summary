what would happen if the moon was replaced by various planets in the sky ? one @entity5 user has taken a look at this hypothetical scenario - and the results are rather impressive			1
in a video they show how moving the planets closer would fill our sky with stunning views - and it reveals just how large some of the planets are compared to the moon			1
they illustrated how the planets would look in the moon 's position			1
the video reveals how large some would appear in hypothetical scenario			1
if it did happen , it 's unlikely @entity33 would survive the close encounters the video was created by @entity5 user @entity35			1
‘ this is a visualization of what it might be like if the @entity41 was replaced with some of the other planets at the same distance as our moon , ’ they explain			0
moon : 1,080 miles ( 1,738km ) @entity47 : 2,111 miles ( 3,397km ) @entity48 : 3,761 miles ( 6,052km ) @entity49 ( equatorial ) : 15,701 miles ( 25,269km ) @entity51 ( equatorial ) : 15,882 miles ( 25,559km ) @entity24 ( equatorial , not including rings ) : 37,449 miles ( 60,268km ) @entity55 ( equatorial ) : 44,422 miles ( 71,490km ) in order the video shows @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity51 , @entity55 and @entity24 in place of the moon			2
@entity61 is purposefully left off as it is a similar size to the moon ‘ and hence is boring			0
’ with our moon measuring a paltry 1,738km in radius , the other planets dwarf it in size when shown in its position about 240,000 miles ( 384,000km ) from @entity33			2
@entity47 , for instance , is about twice the size , with a radius of 1,080 miles ( 3,397km )			0
@entity51 is about 25 times larger at 15,882 miles ( 25,559km ) in radius , while @entity55 completely outclasses it with a radius of 44,422 miles 71,490km )			0
interestingly , some of the moons of the planets would also be in a collision course with @entity33			2
@entity84 , for example , which orbits @entity24 at a distance of 235,000 miles ( 377,000km ) , would likely impact @entity33 if @entity24 were in place of the moon			0
here @entity24 is seen , pictured by @entity87 in 1980 , with its moons @entity90 ( bottom left ) and @entity84 ( middle )			0
if @entity24 were in the position of the moon , it 's likely that @entity84 would impact @entity33 at some point - although of course the scenario is only hypothetical another interesting effect would be the gravitational influence on @entity33 if the planets were placed that close			1
they could strip away our atmosphere and cause huge tides and volcanoes			0
if @entity55 were the planet in the moon 's position , it ’s likely @entity33 would not even survive intact , being close enough to possibly be ripped apart and form a ring around the gas giant			1
a second video also reveals what the moon would look like if it were in the position of the @entity115 with our moon measuring a paltry 1,738km in radius , the other planets dwarf it in size when shown in its position about 240,000 miles ( 384,000km ) from @entity33 ( illustration shown ) at an orbital height of just 255 miles ( 415km ) , the @entity115 is relatively close to @entity33			1
but place the moon there and it would fill most of the sky as @entity33 rotates , blocking out the sun and sending the planet into darkness for long portions			2
of course , all of these scenarios are merely hypothetical and just a light - hearted look at the solar system			0
but they do help to illustrated the different sizes of objects in @entity33 ’s vicinity .			0

@entity5 user from @entity21 has illustrated planets in the night sky
they illustrated how the planets would look in the moon 's position
the video reveals how large some would appear in hypothetical scenario
if it did happen , it 's unlikely @entity33 would survive the close encounters
another video shows the moon at the ' low ' height of the @entity115
