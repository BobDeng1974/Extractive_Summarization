he and his wife took turns to wake up in the night and feed her every three hours from a baby ’s bottle filled with warm , diluted , evaporated milk			0
@entity64 , senior curator of animals at @entity21 , saluted mr @entity4 and his wife , who died in 2008 , for doing such a good job as foster parents			1

all that is down to how she was reared			0
