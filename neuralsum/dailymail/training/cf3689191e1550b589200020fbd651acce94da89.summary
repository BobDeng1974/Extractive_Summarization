by @entity0 published : 05:08 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 05:08 est , 27 august 2013 @entity1 snuck in and out of privileged @entity3 households for years helping pampered teens with their college applications a top @entity3 tutor has revealed some of the dirtiest tricks played by parents when trying to score their child a place at @entity13 universities			1
@entity1 worked as an independent college - applications counselor for 15 years all over the @entity15 , and has revealed desperate measures taken by parents in over competitive @entity3 were the most shocking of them all			1
speaking to the @entity20 , ms @entity1 let slip how the majority of these privileged parents set their children up to fail from the beginning of their education and then bully them into complete disbelief when it comes to the dreaded college application essay			2
ms @entity1 said : ' here the frenzy is amplified by money and power as it only can be in @entity3			1
here , too , the opportunities for obsessive parents to break a student 's heart seem sharper than anywhere else			2
' the former tutor and author revealed how her students had such low self - belief they would sob in front of blank pages when trying to compose their applications , describing the process as ' hopeless ' after their parents had done little to encourage their personal abilities			1
ms @entity1 revealed how children are placed on the @entity13 fast track from as young as two when their parents employ consultants to deliver nursery school acceptances			2
if the child shows any kind of academic weakness as they grow older , a tutor is immediately instated and if this fails the parents will try to identify a deficit in the child 's capabilities and pass this off as a handicap to get them out of situations where they may fail , according to ms @entity1			1
universities are chosen two years in advance , and are ordered in preference according to which top school the child 's parents attended ( this is referred to as a " legacy school " ) and then by where the family has most influence			1
universities like @entity78 ( pictured ) and @entity79 are at the top of the list for pushy parents who will make up almost anything to secure their child a place after schools are selected according to this code , the teenager is required to compose the dreaded application essay - which is where ms @entity1 comes in			1
because most of the teens have never had to do things for themselves in the past , the majority struggle with this ubiquitous task			2
ms @entity1 says : ' faced with that blank page , the students panic			0
their entire lives have been pointed towards this one test of their worth			0
who would n't suffer writer 's block ? the parents yell			0
' according to @entity1 , the pampered teens of @entity3 become overwhelmed when writing application essays because their parents do n't believe in them			1
posed by model ' from 2000 to 2010 , more than 90 percent of my students were accepted at their top - choice schools			1
my name was shared among wealthy families who would not have dreamed of hiring one of the big college - application consulting shops ; they wanted exclusivity , someone other students could n’t have			2
' ms @entity1 claims she was often requested to fill out false invoices so the wealthy family involved were n't caught out using her services			0
but the dishonesty did n't stop there as she recalls one frustrated mother who , distraught her @entity128 son 's @entity129 was n't good enough for @entity13 education , forced him to state he was black on his application to better his chances			0
' “ my ex-husband , he ’s not seeing the application , so we ’ll say what we want			0
we lived four years in @entity138			0
so , we will check the box and say he is black " why not ? ” she pressed me			0
“ can they ask for proof ? ” ' , ms @entity1 recalls			0
the rouse however did not work , and the mortified boy in question was not admitted like so many others whose parents are left astounded and demanding answers when their money and power falls short			1
ms @entity1 's experience has inspired her first novel , @entity155 , which is out this week .			0
