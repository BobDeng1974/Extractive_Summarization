a golden opportunity to register a rare victory on the @entity2 slipped through the fingers of @entity4 and @entity5 on monday			1
but their failure opened the door for an even more heart - warming outcome : victory for two - time open winner @entity11 at the second play - off hole of the @entity14 at @entity15 in @entity16			1
the crushing decline of @entity11 has been documented well enough in the past six years			1
@entity11 celebrates his @entity14 golf win on monday at @entity15 harrington tips his hat to the crowd as he walks to the green on the second playoff hole @entity5 plays his shot out of a bunker on the 14th hole during the @entity14 with @entity11 in danger of falling outside the world ’s top 300 , it seemed a mystery why he did n’t put his name forward last month as a candidate to be @entity35 ’s captain at the @entity36 in @entity37 next year			1
but the model @entity38 , now 43 , had the last word on monday with his first win in seven years on one of the two main tours			1
reduced to asking for invitations to play in @entity45 these days , he made full use of one at the @entity14			0
he led at halfway , and then in a see - saw final round he got the better of rookie @entity45 @entity50 having needed a birdie at the 18th to force a play - off			0
@entity53 opined that he could see tension in the @entity11 swing during the third round , which was hardly surprising given all the problems he ’s had on the course these last few years			1
@entity5 of @entity60 and his caddie are seen during the continuation of the fourth round of the @entity14 after winning @entity64 in 2007 and 2008 , followed by the @entity65 the same year , he suffered his first winless year for a decade in 2009			2
while the @entity38 managed just one top - five finish in majors over the next five years , his ranking plummeted from world no 2 to 297 at the start of this year			2
after yesterday ’s win , @entity11 moves up to @entity72 and qualifies for this year ’s masters			1
and some of the putting woes that have contributed to his fall re-appeared during the final round , only for @entity11 to hold his nerve with a level - par 70 that set up the win			1
@entity11 said : ‘ hopefully this is n’t an isolated win			2
i think i have found that mental edge i had been missing and hopefully i can be consistently contending			0
believe it or not , when i get in contention i can still hit the shots			0
’ for @entity4 , it was the second week in a row he had experienced such frustration , after losing a sudden death play - off in the @entity90 last week			2
for @entity5 , who went into the water five times in a final round of 75 that left him tied third with @entity4 , it means the long wait to register a stroke - play success on @entity45 soil , stretching back over 150 events and more than 10 years , goes on			1
@entity11 putts on the second playoff hole during the @entity14 at @entity100 the 39 - year - old has won stroke - play events in @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity35 , but his sole victory in the @entity45 came in the @entity107 in @entity108 in 2010			1
‘ it ’s just bitterly disappointing to put myself in the position i have , to play as well as i ’ve played ... and a couple of loose shots has cost me this tournament , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ it ’s a shame to hand tournaments away			0
’ a monday finish at the @entity14 proved a necessity after violent storms had wreaked havoc on friday and saturday			0
the two @entity120 began the last 11 holes of the final round on monday with a one - stroke lead over @entity124			0
@entity4 watches his tee shot on the 15th hole during the @entity14 at @entity100 both englishmen will look to the positives after going so close			0
for @entity5 it brings to an end a miserable 15 months during which he has n’t finished in the top 10 in tournaments , never mind win			1
for @entity4 , it ’s further evidence that his career is now firmly back on track			0
the 37 - year - old turned his back on the @entity141 to concentrate on @entity45 this year and his decision has been vindicated by his golf over the past fortnight			0
barely inside the world ’s top 100 at the beginning of february , he is on the verge of earning an invitation to play in the masters in april			0
the scene now switches 60 miles south to @entity152 and the first event this year in which all the world ’s best players are in the same place at the same time — the @entity157 at @entity158 .			0

@entity4 and @entity5 let a rare @entity2 victory slip away
their failure opened the door for two - time open winner @entity11
it was @entity11 *'s* first win in seven years on one of the two main tours
@entity5 finishes in the @entity172 of a tournament for first time in 15 months
