by @entity0 support : mp @entity2 has been one of the most vociferous critics of payday loans mps and experts have hit out at a promised crackdown on payday loan firms after it failed to cap extortionate interest rates			1
the new government watchdog , the @entity11 , yesterday announced controls to tackle irresponsible lending and bully boy tactics			1
they will include mandatory ‘ affordability checks ’ and limits on how many times the lenders can raid the bank accounts of defaulting customers			1
but critics said the @entity11 should have announced a cap on interest rates , which can top 5,800 per cent , or even an outright ban on the industry			1
one mp who has campaigned vociferously on the issue , @entity2 , warned that concerns over payday loans could turn into a scandal to match the mis - selling of payment protection insurance unless more urgent action is taken			1
there were hopes that the new @entity11 , which takes over regulation for consumer credit from the @entity38 in april next year , would have used its stronger powers to impose tougher controls on loan sharks			1
payday lenders have flourished on the back of a cost of living crisis by offering expensive short - term loans to millions			2
the industry has grown from virtually nothing five years ago to lending more than £ 2billion a year , despite the extortionate interest rates involved			1
new rules : the controls will include mandatory ' affordability checks ' and limit the number of times lenders can raid defaulting customers ' accounts top lender : caps would have applied to the likes of market leader @entity58 which has faced fierce criticism in the past the archbishop of @entity62 , @entity61 , has condemned the damaging impact of companies such as market leader @entity58			1
a study published by the government yesterday revealed that the lenders have failed to abide by promises to treat customers fairly			2
one in five borrowers reported that when they took out an initial loan their lender did not ask about their finances to make sure they could afford repayments			2
nearly one in four came under pressure to extend their loan , which can dramatically increase the cost , while half said lenders did not explain the risks			2
borrowers are required to fill out a @entity84 form , which allows the lender to effectively raid their account to grab repayments			2
nearly one in three customers reported that the @entity84 system was not clearly explained , while 60 per cent were not told how to cancel @entity84			2
the new regime , which does not come into effect until after april next year , will make affordability checks on borrowers mandatory and limit the number of loan roll - overs to two			0
it will also restrict the number of times lenders can use the @entity84 system to tap into a customer ’s account to two			0
miss @entity2 said the new rules should have included a cap on interest rates			0
caps have been imposed in @entity105 , @entity106 , and several @entity108 countries , while most states in the @entity110 have effectively banned payday lenders			0
miss @entity2 said : ‘ the reason people get into problems is because of the cost of this credit and what that does to people who are already struggling			0
‘ the evidence from other countries is that capping works			0
we see lower levels of personal debt and lower levels of illegal lending			1
‘ people are lying awake at night panicking about how they pay the escalating cost of these debts			0
’ she likened the scale of the problem to the mis - selling of @entity133 by the big banks , when billions of pounds worth of useless insurance policies were sold			0
outspoken : archbishop of canterbury @entity61 has condemned the damaging power of payday loan firms ‘ if we do n’t act now to change this , this is going to be the next @entity133 scandal – i am convinced of it , ’ she said			0
@entity145 , professor of organisational behaviour at @entity147 , said : ‘ the regulations do not address the usurious rates of interest charged			0
nor do they ask whether the industry should exist at all			1
’ however , the chief of the new @entity11 , @entity152 , insisted the firms do provide a useful service			1
‘ many people make use of these loans and pay off their debt without a hitch , so we do n’t want to stop that happening , ’ he said			0
but , he warned : ‘ this type of credit must only be offered to those that can afford it			0
’ the @entity167 , which represents the interests of payday loan businesses , said a cap on interest would lead to more illegal lending .			1

the @entity11 announced restrictions on irresponsible lending
but critics say that controls do *n't* go far enough with some calling for ban on the industry
