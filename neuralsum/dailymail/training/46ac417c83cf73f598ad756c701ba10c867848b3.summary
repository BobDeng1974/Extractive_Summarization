by @entity0 published : 04:44 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 12:08 est , 17 october 2013 a controversial @entity2 free school is set to be placed in special measures after a damning official report condemned it as ' dysfunctional ' and says that it is ' in chaos '			1
@entity6 , a free school in @entity8 , has repeatedly been featured in the @entity9 for allegedly forcing women teachers to cover their hair and making boys and girls sit separately in class			1
@entity16 inspectors launched an urgent investigation into the school , and listed a number of serious criticisms in their official report , which was published this morning			1
@entity22 said he would be prepared to shut down the school if it does not improve quickly			1
a minister told @entity25 today that the school would not be allowed to ' languish in failure ' and insisted the @entity28 had taken ' swift action ' to deal with the problem			1
damning : @entity6 free school in @entity8 has been heavily criticised in an official @entity16 inspection report the report found that teachers were inexperienced , with many having never taught before , and were overly generous in assessing pupils ' work			1
it also wrote that boys and girls ate lunch in separate shifts , while older pupils were segregated by sex in the classroom			0
' this school is dysfunctional , ' the report stated			1
' the basic systems and processes a school needs to operate well are not in place			0
the school is in chaos and reliant on the goodwill of an interim principal to prevent it totally collapsing			0
' it continued : ' this is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience			0
' leadership and management , including governance , are inadequate and have been unable to improve the school			2
' rules : a member of staff from the school , where female teachers were told to wear headscarves inspectors added : ' staff have been appointed to key roles for which they do not have qualifications and experience			2
for example , most of the primary school teachers have not taught before and the head of the primary school is experienced in teaching secondary - aged pupils only			0
' sir @entity82 , the chief inspector of schools , called for @entity6 to be placed in special measures in the report , which rates the school as ' inadequate ' in every category			1
@entity6 opened in september 2012 as one of the free schools which are the cornerstone of the @entity28 's education policy , and has 412 pupils aged between four and 16			1
it boasts of having ' a strong @entity2 ethos ' , with long school days and shorter holiday , which ' maximise opportunities for pupil achievement and success '			0
the @entity16 inspection was brought forward following reports that religious hardliners had taken control of the school and imposed @entity106 rules on all staff and pupils , including non-muslims			1
after the first day of the inspection , officials found so many worrying problems that they asked management to close down the school entirely while the investigation continued			2
according to the report , pupils in the secondary school ' are generally given the same work regardless of their ability ' , meaning that the most able students are not sufficiently stretched			2
inspectors wrote that one hour - long maths lesson consisted almost entirely of pupils cutting out and pasting different shapes , while they said that the only subject which taught crucial literacy skills was islamic studies			0
the school 's problem 's mean that ' attendance is low and declining ' , the report said , leading to problems with ' behaviour and safety '			1
acting headteacher @entity137 accepted that the school has ' significant and serious problems ' and that some lessons are not challenging pupils enough			2
' obviously the report does n't make pleasant reading for anybody , ' he told the @entity145			0
' we do n't want to be in this position - we wish we were n't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward			2
' he said today : ' any school that faces special measures , as we clearly now do , has got its fair share of problems			1
i accept we have a whole range of problems			0
' some of those are things we can fix in the short term quite quickly			0
some of them are longer - term in terms of the longer - term progress for students , teaching and learning etc. ' criticism : the report of the @entity16 inspection rated @entity6 as ' inadequate ' on every criterion when asked how parents have reacted to the news , dr @entity137 said : ' in many ways the parents are aware more of the reality of the school than the @entity9 are			1
' they did n't have the concerns about the segregation			0
you 'll notice in the report that @entity16 said that there were no concerns about that			2
' they did n't have any concerns about the hijab			0
what they 're seeing is the school is on a journey			0
i think we 're in a position now where we 're not where we want to be in terms of practicalities for the building			0
' in terms of having the right number of staff in place in key roles , that 's what we need to do now			2
we need key staff in key roles to allow the school to move forward as quickly as possible			2
' asked whether he was concerned the school could face closure , he said : ' there will need to be a school here for 412 children as of the end of last month			0
' there are people on a daily basis who are doing a very difficult job very well			0
it 's not something they signed up to when they came to the school to be a member of staff here			2
' we will do what 's possible in the timescales that we 're given			0
it 's business as usual for our children			0
' ' @entity232 action ' : schools minister @entity233 told the @entity234 that the school 's problems would be quickly tackled by the government the prime minister told the @entity239 : ' i am not afraid to shut the school , of course			1
' we are taking rapid corrective action towards the school			0
we are taking a tougher approach and schools will be shut			0
' he added : ' i am very disappointed all round by the @entity16 report and what is happening at the school , which is why we are acting swiftly			1
' answering an urgent question in the @entity254 today , schools minister @entity233 said : ' after a steady start by the school , we became aware of potential breaches of the conditions in its funding agreement late this summer , and at the end of july we began a wide - ranging investigation in to the financial management and governance of the school			2
' we investigated whether the school was delivering on its requirement to be inclusive and we investigated some allegations about the imposition of a dress requirement on some members of staff			0
' our investigations did indeed find significant and numerous breaches of the conditions in its funding agreement and our concerns were such that we requested @entity16 to bring forward its planned inspection			2
' closed : the school was temporarily shut down during the urgent @entity16 investigation he added : ' the @entity16 report is published this morning			1
it has found the school is dysfunctional and is inadequate across every category of inspection ' we will not let any school , whether a free school , an academy school or a local authority school , languish in failure			1
' the @entity16 report confirms we are taking the right actions			2
we are not prepared to let a school fail its parents , its children and its community			0
we said we would take swift action in these cases and that is exactly what we are doing			1
' @entity303 education secretary @entity302 said @entity305 's free schools agenda was ' out of control ' , adding that the policy had been dealt a ' devastating blow ' by the revelations in @entity8			1
' the education secretary has sacrificed learning for ideology , ' he told @entity25			0
' it is not just @entity314 which is dysfunctional , it is the @entity316 's free schools policy			1
' as the report was published , the @entity317 released a letter sent to chairman of governors @entity322 by schools minister @entity323 , in which he says that @entity16 's report confirms the ' very serious concerns ' he raised in a previous letter to the school			1
' the report is further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement i have required you to address , ' he writes			0
' contrary to your suggestion that i have acted prematurely , i am even more convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of the @entity341 to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious failings at the school			0
' clash : @entity6 is one of the free schools championed by education secretary @entity305 , left ; his @entity350 opposite number @entity302 , right , says that it shows the policy has failed the local mp , @entity352 , has called for the school to be closed down completely following the litany of complaints			1
' frankly , the position of @entity314 is now untenable and i would fully expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative places in the council schools in the city , ' he told the @entity145			1
mr @entity302 told the @entity362 that the school 's problems show that the @entity28 's education reforms have failed			1
' what this report exposes is that @entity22 and @entity305 's free school programme has become a dangerous free - for - all - an out of control ideological experiment that has closed a school , leaving 400 children losing an entire week of learning , ' he said			1
' pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know how @entity22 and @entity305 have allowed this to happen - especially as @entity16 identified that this school was not meeting the basic requirements on child protection before it was opened			1
' far from an isolated incident , the failings at this school reveal the systemic threat to education standards under this government			0
@entity22 and @entity305 can no longer ignore this issue - it is a crisis entirely of their own making			0
' a @entity317 spokesman said : ' we were already investigating this school before allegations became public			0
we discussed the problems with @entity16 and it launched an immediate inspection			1
' we have received a response from the @entity341 as well as a report on the school from @entity16			1
any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence			0
' @entity402 said it acknowledged the findings of the @entity16 report			2
a statement said : ' educational attainment for all children and young people in @entity8 is as always our priority			0
the council is keen to work with other agencies as partners to address the key issues outlined in the @entity16 report			1

@entity314 in @entity8 was closed for @entity16 inspection after reports that bosses segregated students and made staff cover their heads
inspectors ' report denounces @entity106 school as ' dysfunctional '
damning *verdict* calls for @entity6 to be placed in special measures
minister insists @entity28 has taken ' swift action ' to address problems
@entity22 threatens to shut the school down if it does not improve
@entity350 says the *scandal* shows failure of @entity28 's free schools policy
