but a little over a year ago , the scene could not look more different - as the girls were born conjoined at the chest and abdomen and anxiously awaiting a complicated separation surgery			1
now nearly 14 months since the twins - who will turn two in march - were successfully separated , their parents have revealed that they are happy , healthy and active toddlers			1
' seeing the girls and seeing them climb and get in to things - as aggravated as i get i ca n't help but laugh because they 're an absolute miracle , ' their mother @entity14 told @entity20			1
the girls were born joined at lower chest and abdomen but were successfully separated in a 7 - hour surgery the girls were born to @entity14 and her husband @entity28 , from @entity29 , @entity30 , despite a doctor initially recommending the expectant parents abort the girls after a scan showed they were conjoined			1
' as he was telling me , i could literally feel the girls kicking in my belly and i knew that that wasnâ € ™ t something possible , ' @entity14 said			1
the @entity41 , who already had a young son , sought a second opinion at @entity44 of @entity45 , where doctors said that the girls could be separated when they were born			2
after the birth , the family lived full time at the hospital as the twins prepared for surgery			0
today : the girls are now happy , healthy and active toddlers with distinct personalities sharing : @entity3 and @entity2 are thriving even though a doctor suggested their mother terminate the pregnancy proud : their parents , @entity14 and @entity28 , called the girls ' a miracle ' and said they love watching them grow an incredible x-ray showed the daunting task doctors had ahead of them , with the girls joined at a significant portion of their fronts			1
they shared a chest wall , diaphragm , pericardium and liver			2
then on november 7 last year , a team of 40 doctors and nurses successfully carried out the seven - hour surgery to separate @entity3 and @entity2			2
after the separation , @entity14 wrote on her blog : ' @entity28 and i are thrilled that our daughters have been given this remarkable gift by the amazing team from @entity84 of @entity45			2
' we are so grateful for the support and encouragement that the medical team , our families and our friends have given us during this long journey			0
' because they did n't share a lot of internal organs , the prognosis for the twins was very positive			0
huge task : a daunting x-ray showed the area doctors had to separate in the grueling surgery last year former life : @entity14 , who gave birth to the girls in march 2012 , is pictured with the girls before the separation ' seeing them for the first time as two separate girls was really the most amazing feeling , ' @entity104 told @entity20			1
footage of the girls now shows them as two very individual personalities as they push each other in strollers , play with a mini basketball hoop or share snacks together			0
' i 'm thankful for every single day , ' their mother added			0
' i ca n't describe it			0
' the surgery was the 21st separation of conjoined twins performed at the hospital			0
the procedure involved about 40 medical staff members			0
conjoined twins occur once in every 50,000 to 60,000 births , and most are stillborn			0
about three - quarters of such twins are female and are joined at least partially in the chest , sharing organs			2
challenge : around 40 medical staff worked for seven hours to separate the girls - after practicing on dolls success ! the girls had a good prognosis as they did not share any major organs ; they have now recovered family : the @entity41 , including their son @entity139 , are pictured together following the life - changing surgery chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs , the hospital said			0
two years ago , conjoined 20 - month - old twins from the @entity150 were separated at a @entity152 hospital			2
@entity153 and @entity154 were attached at the lower chest , and surgical teams successfully divided their liver , pancreas and other shared organ systems and reconstructed their abdominal walls			1
a few days before that , 2 - year - old twin sisters @entity161 and @entity162 from @entity163 , @entity164 , who were joined at the chest and abdomen , were separated in procedures performed at a @entity164 hospital			1

@entity3 and @entity177 were born joined at the lower chest and abdomen and were separated in a complicated procedure at 8 months
now more than a year on , the girls are *normal* active toddlers
the great news comes 2 years after a doctor told the parents to terminate the pregnancy
mother @entity14 : ' they 're an absolute miracle '
