by @entity0 an iceberg twice the size of @entity3 has torn away from one of @entity6 's largest glaciers			1
for several years , scientists had been watching a long crack near the tip of the northerly @entity10			1
on monday , @entity12 satellites showed it had broken completely , freeing an iceberg measuring 46 square miles			1
break away : a satellite image taken on monday shows the crescent - shaped crack ( shown in the red circle ) on the @entity10 in northwestern @entity6 a massive ice sheet covers about four - fifths of @entity6			1
@entity10 is mostly on land , but a segment sticks out over water like a frozen tongue , and that 's where the break occurred			1
the same glacier spawned an iceberg twice that size two years ago			2
together , the breaks made a large change that 's got the attention of researchers			2
it 's disturbing , ' said @entity37 professor @entity36 , who was one of the first researchers to notice the break			1
scrutiny : a 2010 image , ( left ) and 2012 provided shows the formation of the crack			0
scientists had been watching the 15 - mile long crack in the floating ice shelf of the glacier for several years ' we have data for 150 years and we see changes that we have not seen before			1
' ' it 's one of the manifestations that @entity6 is changing very fast , ' he said			0
researchers suspect global warming is to blame , but ca n't prove it conclusively yet			1
glaciers do calve icebergs naturally , but what 's happened in the last three years to @entity60 is unprecedented , @entity61 and other scientists say			2
' this is not part of natural variations anymore , ' said @entity12 glaciologist @entity66 , who camped on @entity60 10 years ago			0
@entity68 ice scientist @entity67 said there is still a chance it could be normal calving , like losing a fingernail that has grown too long , but any further loss would show it 's not natural : ' we 're still in the phase of scratching our heads and figuring out how big a deal this really is			2
' many of @entity6 's southern glaciers have been melting at an unusually rapid pace			0
the @entity60 break brings large ice loss much farther north than in the past , said @entity83 , lead scientist at the @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity86 if it continues , and more of the @entity60 is lost , the melting would push up sea levels , he said			0
the ice lost so far was already floating , so the breaks do n't add to global sea levels			1
@entity6 and @entity92 have been warming five times faster than the average global temperature , @entity36 said			2
temperatures have increased there by about 4 degrees fahrenheit in the last 30 years , @entity83 said			0
the new iceberg is likely to follow the path of the one in 2010 , @entity36 said			0
that broke apart into smaller icebergs headed north , then west and last year started landing in @entity101 , he said			0
it 's more than glaciers in @entity6 that are melting			0
scientists also reported this week that the @entity105 had the largest sea ice loss on record for june .			0

formed a 46 square mile iceberg when it broke away on monday
scientists had been watching the 15 - mile long crack in the floating ice shelf of the northerly @entity10 for several years
@entity37 professor : ' it 's dramatic . it 's disturbing '
researchers suspect global warming is to blame , but ca n't prove it yet
