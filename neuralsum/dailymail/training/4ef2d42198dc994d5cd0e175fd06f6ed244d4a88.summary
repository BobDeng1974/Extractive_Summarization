@entity0 became world - famous for her curvy figure , but it may be surprising to know that keeping that alluring hourglass involved a lot of work			1
just before she hit it big in ' @entity9 ' , @entity7 photographed her for @entity10 , taking a few candid shots of her daily workout routine			1
one picture of @entity0 in a hugging white dress made it onto the cover of the april 7 , 1952 issue , while the shots of her lifting weights in a terry - cloth bikini were left on the cutting room floor - rarely seen			1
she made the april 7 , 1952 cover glimpse : the candid shots of @entity0 working out did n't make it to the magazine , and have rarely been seen the black - and - white photographs show a very - serious @entity0 performing squats and military presses with a bar , and bench - pressing small weights			1
she then cracks a smile mid-handstand and gives a come - hither look while relaxing on the floor			1
at the time of the photoshoot , @entity0 was not yet a household name but even then she was beginning to use her wiles on men			2
@entity7 later wrote about the shoot and talked about being quite enamored with his subject			1
' she flirted with all three of us , ' @entity7 said			2
' and such was her talent that each of us felt that if only the other two would leave , something incredible would happen			0
her sex - appeal was not a put - on - it was her weapon and her defense			1
' come hither : @entity7 later wrote about the shoot , saying @entity0 was extremely flirtatious with him and the other men in the room gymnast : @entity0 giggles as she tries out a handstand more than just a sex symbol : @entity7 noted seeing several intellectual books scattered across @entity0 's cheap apartment on the outskirts of @entity71 but her cheap apartment on the outskirts of @entity71 also held clues that she was more than just sex appeal			1
' @entity75 of @entity76 ' : the pictures were taken for the april 7 , 1952 cover story of @entity10 ' what impressed me in its shabby living room was the obvious striving for self - improvement , ' @entity7 wrote			1
' i saw a photograph of @entity85 and a multitude of books that i did not expect to find there , like the works of @entity90 , of @entity91 , the history of @entity93 , etc. on the floor were two dumbbells			2
' @entity0 detailed her health regimen later that year in a september 1952 interview with now - defunct @entity98			1
' frankly , i ’ve never considered my own figure so exceptional			0
until quite recently , i seldom gave it any thought at all , ' a humble @entity0 said			0
' my biggest single concern used to be getting enough to eat			0
now i have to worry about eating too much			0
i never used to bother with exercises			0
' she went on to explain that she spent about 10 minutes every morning practicing ' bust - firming ' exercises with small weights - but she maintains she 's not a fitness - freak			2
' i do n’t count rhythmically like the exercise people on the radio ; i could n’t stand exercise if i had to feel regimented about it , ' she said			0
@entity0 also talks about her diet , which others told her were ' absolutely bizarre '			0
for breakfast , @entity0 drank a glass of warm milk with an egg whipped as well as a multivitamin			0
' i doubt if any doctor could recommend a more nourishing breakfast for a working girl in a hurry , ' she said			2
bizarre breakfast : in an interview with @entity98 in september 1952 , @entity0 said she drank milk with an egg whipped in for breakfast each morning routine : @entity0 also revealed that she did 10 minutes of a bust - firming exercise each morning relaxed : but @entity0 also said she did n't like to make her exercises seem to regimented balanced : @entity0 often treated herself to a hot fudge sunday after a long day of work the actress completely skips talking about lunch , but says her dinner is almost always the same - some sort of protein with raw baby carrots			1
' i must be part rabbit , i never get bored with raw carrots , ' she wrote			0
but she made sure to save room for dessert			2
' in recent months i have developed the habit of stopping off at @entity145 ’s ice cream parlor for a hot fudge sundae on my way home from my evening drama classes			0
i ’m sure that i could n’t allow myself this indulgence were it not that my normal diet is composed almost totally of protein foods			0

photos of the *starlet* working out were left on the cutting - room floor after a 1952 shoot for @entity10
