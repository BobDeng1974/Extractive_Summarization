by @entity0 error : the @entity3 's parent company @entity2 accidentally gave more than 6,000 customers loans they could n't afford due to a systems glitch @entity8 's second biggest payday loan giant has agreed to refund more than £ 700,000 to customers after admitting it gave out loans that people could not afford			1
@entity2 , which was trading as @entity13 , will refund interest on the loans , plus any default charges imposed because customers missed repayments			1
however , there will be no further compensation , while the finance giant , which is responsible for one in four payday loans , will not face any fines			0
details were announced by the @entity26 watchdog , the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , which said @entity2 has also promised to order an independent review of the way it lends money			1
the problems occurred because of a computer ‘ systems error ’ and relate to loans to some 6,247 customers which were made between january 2013 and april this year			1
the @entity37 welcomed the @entity27 announcement , but warned rogue payday loan firms have failed to deliver on promises to treat customers fairly			0
the charity ’s head of policy , @entity42 , said : ‘ despite the payday lending industry ’s repeated assurances that it was lending responsibly and that poor practice was a thing of the past , we have continued to see thousands of cases where people have been trapped in unsustainable and unaffordable cycles of high - cost borrowing , as loans are rolled over and borrowers take on multiple debts			2
‘ today ’s announcement is further evidence that payday loan companies have failed to act in the best interests of borrowers			0
’ the news raises new questions about the failure of payday loan giants , which impose sky - high interest rates backed up with punishing penalty fees , to offer fair treatment to customers			2
the biggest operator , @entity70 , was recently ordered to pay more than £ 2.6million to 45,000 customers who were sent bullying letters from fictitious law firms after falling behind on repayments			2
the company invented the legal and debt recovery firms to turn the screw on customers by giving the impression their cases had been passed to third party organisations			0
the @entity27 said the reason that @entity2 is not facing any sanction is because the company broke its own internal rules designed to ensure loans are affordable , rather than any @entity26 regulations			1
a computer software problem meant that staff at @entity13 agreed higher level loans than the firm ’s own guidelines said were acceptable based on the individual ’s income			1
warning : the @entity27 warned rogue loan firms have failed to treat customers fairly director of supervision at the @entity27 , @entity99 , said : ‘ the @entity27 expects all credit providers to carry out proper checks to ensure that borrowers do n’t take on more than they can afford to pay back			0
‘ we are pleased that @entity2 is working with us to put matters right for its customers and to ensure that these practices are a thing of the past			1
’ dollar will contact all the affected customers and expects to provide refunds in cash totalling £ 79,000 , with the remaining customers seeing their outstanding balance reduced			0
the refunds of interest will only relate to that part of the loan that was above what should have been allowed under the firm ’s own lending criteria			1
separately , @entity2 has committed to improving its approach to assessing affordability and agreed to appoint an independent ‘ @entity123 ’ to review its lending decisions			1
the review will consider whether customers are being treated fairly and are now only being lent sums that they can afford to repay			2
the problems at @entity2 relate to its brand @entity13			1
the firm also operates in the @entity130 under the trading names @entity130 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
payday loans offered by @entity13 have a typical @entity136 interest rate of approaching 3,000per cent			1
the firm also has more than 500 high street outlets offering pawnbroking , cheque cashing , foreign currency , gold - buying services , pre-loaded holiday and cash debit cards and money transfers			0
@entity2 , based in @entity147 , is part of @entity149 , which was founded in @entity150 in the @entity151 in 1979 and now operates across the @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			2
struggling : the ombudsman is concerned that many struggle to repay loans but feel powerless to complain @entity3 managing director , @entity158 , said : ‘ @entity13 is a business which prides itself on the trust enjoyed between customer and company			2
mistakes do happen and , when they do , we can be trusted to put them right , as we have in this instance			0
’ the @entity27 is about to announce new controls on the industry that will effectively cap the interest and charges the firms can apply			2
the decision , which could come later this week , is expected to fix the cap at around £ 30 for every £ 100 borrowed			0
payday lenders are desperate to rehabilitate their image			0
@entity70 yesterday announced the appointment of a new chairman , who promised to review and clean up its loans business			0
@entity179 , the former chief executive of insurer @entity180 , said there will be a review of the customer base and products to ensure that the group is lending only to ‘ customers who can reasonably afford to repay their loans ’			1
