studies show the new urine test to be twice as reliable as the existing blood test for detecting the disease – the most common cancer among @entity17 men			1
it also tells doctors how serious the cancer is			1
this means it should not only save lives but also spare men painful , embarrassing and unnecessary tests and treatments			2
the new test – described as potentially the biggest breakthrough in prostate cancer diagnosis in 25 years – does not involve a rectal examination			1
it is likely to cost as little as £ 10 a patient , and the price tag , combined with its accuracy and simplicity , could even lead to all older men being screened for the disease , as women are for breast cancer			1
the test ’s @entity40 creators have struck a deal with two companies and it is hoped it will be in doctors ’ surgeries later this year			1
private patients will be the first to benefit but @entity48 use could follow			0
@entity49 , a professor of medical oncology , said : ‘ this new test could lead to faster detection that could save hundreds of lives and also offers the potential for huge cost savings			0
’ prostate cancer is the most common cancer in @entity17 men , killing nearly 11,000 people a year , and doctors do not have a 100 per cent accurate way of spotting it			1
the blood test routinely used measures levels of a protein called prostate specific antigen , or @entity66 , but it is wrong more often than it is right			1
this means many men are subjected to the pain , worry and embarrassment of unnecessary biopsies			0
in other cases , fledgling cancers are missed until they have spread elsewhere in the body and are harder to treat			0
the new test uses a urine sample , dispensing with the need for needles			2
it searches the urine for a protein called @entity84 , which is not made by healthy people but is pumped out by tumours			0
in trials , it detected about 70 per cent of prostate cancers , making it twice as accurate as the @entity66 test			2
but the test has a second advantage			0
unlike @entity66 , the amount of @entity84 in urine corresponds with the size of the tumour			0
this is important because prostate cancer is not always life - threatening			1
it often grows slowly and does not always need to be treated straight away			0
many men with tumours that will do them little harm are subjected to surgery and radiotherapy , both of which carry a high risk of incontinence and impotence			0
the new test uses a urine sample , dispensing with the need for needles			2
it searches the urine for a protein called @entity84 , which is not made by healthy people but is pumped out by tumours , and is 70 per cent reliable professor @entity49 , who created the test with dr @entity119 , added : ‘ our trials have shown that levels of @entity84 accurately reflect the amount of cancer in the patient ’s prostate gland			1
‘ small prostate cancers do not require treatment and can be safely monitored ; larger volume cancers require prompt treatment			0
‘ the @entity84 test allows for the urologist to determine which option is best for the patient			0
’ @entity135 , of the @entity136 , which part - funded the research , said : ‘ this is potentially the most exciting development in the diagnosis of prostate cancer for 25 years			1
’ @entity141 @entity17 said professor @entity49 ’s results were encouraging but added that large - scale , long - term trials were needed			2
dr @entity144 , of @entity145 , one of the two companies that will turn the research into a kit for use in doctors ’ surgeries , said : ‘ with prostate and bladder cancers being among the top ten common causes of cancer death , accurate diagnosis is incredibly important			2

new urine test is twice as reliable as the existing blood test for the disease
it also tells doctors how serious it is - and no need for rectal examination
prostate cancer kills nearly 11,000 @entity17 men every year
