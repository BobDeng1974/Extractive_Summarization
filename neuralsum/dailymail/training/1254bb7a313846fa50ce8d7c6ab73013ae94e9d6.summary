two former @entity1 soldiers who have travelled to @entity2 to fight against @entity3 insist they are not mercenaries but involved in a war of ‘ good against evil ’			1
@entity7 , 26 , and @entity8 , 24 , are helping @entity10 peshmerga defend the embattled city of @entity12 from the brutal terror group , whose ranks reportedly include 2,000 @entity16 recruits			1
photographs posted on @entity18 show the pair on the @entity2 frontline dressed in combat fatigues and armed with assault rifles , posing in bullet - scarred buildings			1
insisting they were volunteer fighters , not guns for hire , the ex-servicemen said they would ‘ not do nothing while innocent men , women and children are tortured and murdered by @entity3 while the international community stands by and observes from the luxury of their boardrooms or their tanks on the hill ’			2
they add : ‘ this is not a religious war nor is it a racial war , this is a war of good against evil – a magnificent simplicity			0
’ but mr @entity8 ’s mother said yesterday she was not happy that her son had travelled to @entity60 – known as @entity60 – to fight the @entity62 extremists			1
speaking from her family home in @entity64 , @entity65 , 43 , said : ‘ he ’s been in touch to say he ’s okay , but i do n’t like the fact that he ’s gone there			0
it ’s his life , but he ’s my son			0
’ mr @entity7 , from @entity70 , @entity71 , said he had served in the infantry for five years , including three tours of @entity74 , before leaving earlier this year			1
mr @entity8 , who lives in @entity75 , @entity76 , said in an online cv that he had been in the @entity1 for three years , specialising in reconnaissance , before leaving in 2010 to work for private security companies			1
in august , the friends set up the @entity81 , a security company with the intention of providing ‘ specialist intelligence and surveillance services ’ , and building up detailed information about terror groups			0
the firm ’s motto is : ‘ we will go where the rest fear to go ’			0
on @entity18 , mr @entity8 describes how he had been involved in a fierce clash with @entity39 jihadists			1
@entity10 fighters in the battle for @entity12 : more than two months into its assault on @entity12 , the @entity3 group is still pouring fighters and resources into trying to capture the besieged @entity2 @entity10 town @entity101 : the @entity102 have long - established communities in the north of both @entity105 and @entity2 and have resisted any attempts to extend the violence of @entity2 's civil war into the areas they inhabit he wrote that the ‘ s * * * hit the fan ’ , prompting @entity27 , 28 , a @entity28 veteran wounded fighting with the @entity102 who is understood to have recruited the @entity113 , to reply : ‘ it ’s always interesting the first time you have a bullet fly past your head			1
’ @entity119 , a security consultant who is liaising between the ex-soldiers and their families , said : ‘ they are not being paid			0
they are not participating for any commercial gain			0
’ the @entity125 are investigating reports that a 17 - year - old woman from @entity128 , @entity129 , was also making her way to @entity2 to join the struggle against @entity39			1
she was last seen in @entity132 after catching the @entity133 in the @entity113 and would be the first known @entity113 female fighting the jihadis			0
@entity105 forces say they retook two towns north of @entity138 from @entity3 fighters today , driving them from strongholds they had held for months and clearing a main road from the capital to @entity144			2
there was no independent confirmation that the army , @entity149 militia and @entity10 peshmerga forces had completely retaken @entity151 and @entity152 , about 70 miles north - east of @entity138			1
many residents fled the violence long ago			0
at least 23 peshmerga and militia fighters were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting , medical and army sources said			2
' we have liberated @entity161 and @entity152 , ' said @entity162 , a senior official in the @entity164 party , speaking by phone from a nearby town			0
he estimated 50 @entity3 fighters were killed out of a force of 400			2
@entity105 ’s @entity149 - led government , backed by @entity28 - led air strikes , has been trying to push back the @entity3 since it swept through mainly @entity172 provinces of northern @entity105 in june , meeting virtually no resistance			0
last week the army broke a months - long siege of the country ’s largest refinery north of @entity138 , but @entity3 fighters continue to take territory in the western province of @entity180 , which shares borders with @entity2 , @entity182 and @entity183			1
the militants have been fighting in the last two days to take full control of the @entity180 provincial capital @entity187			0
on sunday , @entity105 and foreign jets struck @entity3 fighters near central @entity187 , provincial council member @entity188 told @entity191			0
clashes continued in the city , he said			0
@entity161 and @entity152 are located in @entity194 which is mainly under the control of the @entity138 government forces and @entity10 peshmerga			2
recapturing the towns would help secure the @entity10 - controlled towns of @entity203 and @entity204 to the north as well as nearby dams and oil fields , peshmerga @entity199 @entity198 said			2
it would also allow the road to be reopened between @entity138 and @entity204 , close to the @entity144 border			0
while the hardline @entity213 forces have not advanced into @entity138 , they hold a ring of towns around the mainly @entity149 capital and have claimed responsibility for a series of bombings in @entity149 districts of the city			0
a car bomb in the @entity149 town of @entity226 , 20 miles southeast of @entity138 , killed five people on sunday , police and medics said			0
two other bombs in towns near the capital killed four other people			0
battleground : a fighter can be seen running through the streets of @entity12			0
it has been under attack since mid-september , when the @entity172 extremists seized a series of villages and much of the town counterattack : a combination of concentrated airstrikes and the arrival late last month of a group of 150 @entity105 peshmerga forces with advanced weapons blunted the edge of the @entity3 offensive they call themselves the @entity250 and boast , ' it is better to live one day as a @entity252 that a thousand days as a sheep			0
' they are the foreign fighters who have travelled to @entity2 to fight , not for jihad , but on behalf of the @entity10 communities who are defending their communities from the advance of @entity260			1
just as hundreds of young @entity261 have gone to fight for the radical islamists of @entity3 , so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies , the @entity102			1
westerners in @entity60 : a photo of @entity268 fighters from the @entity18 page @entity27 , a former @entity28 soldier now with @entity270 ( @entity101 ) , operates @entity271 openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight			1
just as many of the @entity3 's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of @entity172 youth worldwide , many of the initial @entity101 volunteers have come from the @entity10 diaspora			2
in august a hairdresser from @entity282 was reported to be the first @entity283 to travel to fight alongside @entity10 forces			1
ethnic @entity10 @entity285 from @entity286 , 26 , travelled to @entity105 to join the @entity10 peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt @entity3 's lightning advance			1
but since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against @entity3 , perhaps also inspired by the radical socialist experiment underway in the @entity10 autonomous region of @entity60			2
inspired by the social ecologist and anarchist @entity295 it has adopted a vision of ' libertarian municipalism ' calling for @entity102 to create free , self - governing communities			1
last month it was reported that a currently serving @entity113 marine had been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with @entity10 militias during his leave			1
the 22 - year - old @entity305 was quizzed after he prepared to fly from @entity307 on a one - way ticket to @entity309			0
he was suspected of being in contact with @entity10 militant groups			2
two women , @entity313 , 31 , and @entity314 , 20 , have also reportedly travelled to fight with the @entity102 , inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against @entity3 terrorists			1
it is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict			0
there are also claims that a number of @entity261 biker gangs have travelled to @entity2 and are helping to assist the resistance			1
leaders of the @entity331 - based @entity330 , which has strong @entity10 links , have posted images of their @entity335 riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons			2
the news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the @entity341 were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to @entity12 to join the fight against @entity344 .			1

@entity74 veteran @entity7 reported to have travelled to @entity2
former infantryman from @entity348 left the @entity1 this year after five years
@entity8 , from @entity75 , @entity76 , has also travelled to fight
he has been pictured in @entity10 militia social media accounts
they join a number of fighters from the @entity357 travelling to join the @entity102
