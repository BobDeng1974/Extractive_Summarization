by @entity0 @entity1 : 02:51 est , 31 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:29 est , 31 december 2013 major talks aimed at resolving some of the most divisive issues hindering peace in @entity6 have broken down			2
@entity7 said it was ‘ disappointing ’ that @entity10 ’s main political parties could not end bitter rows over parades , flags and the legacy of the @entity15			1
but the prime minister insisted it was vital they ‘ keep going ’ to achieve a crucial breakthrough			1
stalemate : @entity7 ( left ) said it was ' disappointing ' @entity10 's main political parties could not resolve issues hindering peace in @entity6			1
right , @entity24 diplomat dr @entity25 , who chaired the talks he said : ‘ there is a shared commitment to making progress on these very difficult issues that continue to be a focus for tension and division			1
’ former @entity24 diplomat dr @entity25 , who chaired the talks , emerged from a marathon 17 hours of negotiations to announce he had not secured consensus before his end - of - year deadline			1
he said : ‘ all the parties support significant parts of the agreement			2
at the same time , all have some concerns			0
’ he said a working group made up of representatives of the five parties in @entity48 's power - sharing executive would now be set up to try and find another way to build on ' significant progress ' that had been achieved			1
divisive : loyalist protesters holding a flag walk past a burning car in the @entity54 in august after trouble flared during a republican anti-internment parade negotiators from @entity58 , the largest nationalist party in the executive , said they were prepared to recommend the proposals to its ruling executive , but unionists would not sign up to the document by tonight			0
' yes it would have been nice to come out here tonight and say we have got all five parties completely signed on to the text , we are not there , ' dr @entity25 said			1
dr @entity25 , who was commissioned by @entity71 , the @entity73 first minister , and @entity74 , the @entity58 deputy first minister , to chair the six - month process , said he believed there was a prospect that all the parties would either endorse all , or significant parts of his document in the future			1
the @entity73 and @entity83 said they would consult within their parties before making a final judgment on the proposals but both indicated they had major difficulties with elements of the text			1
the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) said it would also be conducting a consultation , but party leader @entity93 said he would be recommending a general endorsement of the proposals			0
dr @entity25 urged mr @entity0 and mr @entity74 to make the details of the final document public so people could make up their own minds			1
he denied the process had been a failure			0
message : mr @entity103 took to @entity104 to say @entity58 were ready to accept a deal but the @entity73 and @entity83 would not today ' success should not be measured by what we report to you tonight or what the party leaders report tonight - i would ask you to judge the success in six months , in a year , 18 months , in two years , that would give a much more realistic definition or yardstick of what constitutes success , ' he said			1
' what i believe what we have done is laid down solid enough foundations stones			0
' dr @entity25 and talks vice-chairman dr @entity122 , a @entity24 foreign affairs expert , said their role in any future political process would be limited , but both insisted they were not washing their hands of the process			1
@entity130 , the @entity131 deputy leader , who along with colleagues was mandated to make a final call on behalf of the party , said she was willing to endorse proposals on the past , but not on flags and parades			1
@entity103 , @entity58 's president , signalled his party 's willingness to strike a full deal			1
he said the proposals presented by dr @entity25 represented a ' compromise position ' and provided the basis for agreement			1
' they are n't perfect , we have had to stretch ourselves to embrace them , ' he said			0
mr @entity103 insisted talks could not continue forever and at some point parties had to ' call it '			2
' the paper produced by dr @entity25 does in the view of our negotiating team provide the basis for agreement , ' he said			2
he said if there was no progress from this point he would be seeking an urgent meeting with the @entity161 and @entity162 governments to call for the production of a road map towards resolution			0
@entity73 negotiator @entity166 said progress had been made but said a number of difficulties remained			2
leadership : @entity74 of @entity58 ( left ) , with the party president @entity103 ( right ) , arrive at the talks ' we do not have an agreement this evening but we are committed to continuing this work beyond now in dialogue with others to try and resolve the outstandiing issues that need to be addressed , ' he said			2
' we owe that to the people of @entity6 , especially to the innocent victims of terrorism who have suffered so much over the decades			0
' the @entity25 process was set up in july to deal with what have become three of the primary obstacles to meaningful reconciliation in @entity6			1
tensions over contentious parades regularly erupt into street violence while disputes over the flying of flags - both on public buildings and in loyalist and republican neighbourhoods - continue to be a source of community conflict			1
reaction : @entity58 president @entity103 said this morning the terms ' are n't perfect , we have had to stretch ourselves to embrace them ' but arguably the most complex issue has been how @entity6 deals with the legacy of a 30 - year - conflict where opposing sides retain competing narratives of what happened and victims still demand both truth and justice regarding thousands of unsolved murders			2
dr @entity25 had initially hoped to strike a comprehensive settlement dealing with all three elements in full , but it became clear from the outset of the intensive negotiation phase earlier this month that was going to be highly unlikely			1
the last day of negotiations began around 10am yesterday and effectively carried straight through to around 5am this morning			0
there was little or no progress made on flags with a proposal to set up a commission to examine the issues over a longer term			0
it is understood the document also proposes the replacement of the government - appointed @entity231 with another set of structures to adjudicate on contentious marches			0
hopeful : @entity25 and o - chair @entity122 ( left ) had hoped that the deal would have been done by today the text also envisaged a new mechanism to oversee dealing with the legacy of the past - with a truth recovery body that would potentially offer limited immunity from prosecution to those who co-operate			1
unionists have indicated concerns with some of the language used and claimed too much focus has been placed on killings perpetrated by state forces			0
@entity251 , the @entity83 leader , said he had an opinion on the document but would not make it public until his party had the chance to examine the proposals			2
' we will have an honest debate and hopefully form a final opinion at the end of that debate , ' he said			0
mr @entity93 said ' bigger and better solutions ' were needed on some aspects , but said he would be recommending that his party give a general endorsement to what had been proposed			0
while mrs @entity130 criticised proposals on parades and flags , she said great work had been done in the past			2
' we have seen a huge sea change in the level of political agreement which has exceeded public expectation , particularly in delivering for the victims and the reconciliation process , ' said the @entity280 mp			0
through the night : figures like @entity282 ( left ) and @entity283 ( right ) from the @entity58 negotiation team inside the @entity286 hotel in @entity280 during the @entity25 talks into the early hours having been given an end - of - year deadline to report , dr @entity25 had aimed to strike a deal before @entity290 but had to return to the @entity24 on christmas eve empty - handed after a marathon session of all - night negotiations last week			1
cutting short his seasonal break , he returned to the region on saturday in a last - ditch bid to secure agreement			0
dr @entity25 is the president of @entity24 think tank the @entity298 , based in @entity299 , and was @entity24 president @entity301 's special envoy to @entity6 from 2001 to 2003			1
@entity302 , @entity303 , said she was disappointed , but the failure to reach a comprehensive agreement should not be seen as the end of the road in seeking to find a way forward on difficult and divisive issues			0
she said : ' i welcome the suggestion by @entity312 that the parties should now lose no time in getting together to see how they can most constructively take things forward			0
i would encourage them to maintain the momentum that their efforts , working with the @entity25 team , has created			2
for our part , the @entity320 will look at how we can best facilitate this			0
' @entity324 , the @entity325 's deputy prime minister , said he too was disappointed			0
but he insisted : ' this is not a step back but rather a step not yet taken			0
that step forward will have to be taken because it is right and necessary and because people across society are demanding it			0

talks between @entity10 's main parties ended without success at 5am

@entity24 chairman @entity25 hoped that deal would be signed today
@entity7 said it was ' disappointing ' that conflict was not resolved
but he urged political parties to ' keep going ' to achieve breakthrough
