by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 19:48 est , 26 december 2013 @entity3 : 12:15 est , 27 december 2013 she played the ice - cold spy chief m in the @entity8 films for the past 17 years			1
but now @entity9 has had a chance to compare her on - screen persona with a real - life head of a secretive intelligence agency			1
the actress came face - to - face with former head of @entity18 @entity17			1
double take : real - life spy chief dame @entity17 meets @entity9 , right , who played @entity20 in the @entity8 films for 17 years @entity22 used the opportunity of guest - editing @entity25 's today programme to interview her fictional counterpart and criticise the @entity28 newspaper for publishing highly sensitive material from @entity31 whistleblower @entity30			1
the 65 - year - old former spook also revealed she was nearly thrown out of a pub after being mistaken for a prostitute while training to be a spy			1
@entity22 had been tasked to find out key personal details from a stranger in a pub during an exercise			2
but her attempts to elicit the information did not elude the eye of the barman who thought she was more lady of the night than spook			0
action : @entity47 as @entity8 , left , and @entity9 as @entity49 head @entity48 together in a scene from the film @entity51 ' i said , but @entity53 has driven me for years			1
" no , no he wo n't know the way "			0
i said : " to the @entity56 building on the @entity57 ? he ca n't miss it " she said : ' the task was to pick someone up in a pub and learn enough about them that you had their date of birth and what they did and what their full name was			1
' i was sent off to a particular pub and it was quite clear that the barman thought i was a hooker and he tried to throw me out and i was getting desperate because i knew i was going to fail this particular test			0
former spy chief dame @entity17 attacked the @entity28 newspaper for publishing leaked information from @entity31 intelligence whistleblower @entity30 , pictured above			1
she said the paper had done untold damage to counter-terrorism efforts with its revelations			0
the ex-director general of @entity18 added that only those in the intelligence services could truly understand the danger of publishing details about the activities of @entity31 and @entity90 spy agencies			1
@entity22 said : ' i do understand there are people who think he has done the public a service and who applaud him			2
' but i ca n't be one of them because what neither the @entity28 , nor really anybody , including me , can judge is what damage he has done to counter-terrorism			1
' we ca n't , i ca n't , they ca n't see what the loss of information is ; what plots were being investigated that have now gone dark ; what will now not be detected and not now be thwarted			1
she added : ' my concern is the damage which i do n't think anybody outside the intelligence community can really detect or judge			0
' i do n't think those who have published can possibly work out what those consequences are because they do n't have access to the information			0
' she told the programme : ' the debate should not be what the capability of the state is , because the terrorist has that capability			2
but what should be authorised and who does the authorisation and what are the limits on it			0
' @entity22 also speculated that @entity31 authorities might seek to do a deal with @entity30 , who has been granted temporary asylum in @entity139 after leaking thousands of sensitive government documents earlier this year , to prevent more information being disclosed			2
she said : ' i think what will happen actually is there will come a deal that he does n't release any more , but i really do n't know			0
' eventually , another drinker turned his attentions on her and she managed to extract enough information			0
' so i sat down in the corner feeling rather miserable and had a drink , and i was picked up by an @entity31 who was selling lasers , i think , to the @entity139			0
i thought he was a plant — i could n’t believe he was real			0
' she added : ' he was lonely , he told me his entire life history			2
i kept having to rush out to the ladies and write it down			0
' i got sort of an essay on him and i got a distinction in that part of the test and i had done nothing but sit there			0
' the former spy chief , who resigned as director general of @entity18 in 2007 , took the opportunity of a day in the editor 's chair at @entity25 's flagship current affairs programme to interview @entity9			1
the actress told how she was once late for lunch with the boss of @entity49 – because the driver sent by the @entity179 could not find where to pick her up			1
dame @entity9 , who famously played spy boss m in the @entity8 movies for a 17 - year span , had been invited along to the @entity184 to meet her real - life counterpart sir @entity185			1
but in an interview for the @entity188 4 today programme she explained that she was issued with a special driver whose bungling led to her being 45 minutes late			1
@entity9 tells her : ‘ i did get to go to @entity49 once – i was invited to lunch by sir @entity185			1
' i said but @entity53 has driven me for years			0
" no , no he wo n’t know the way "			0
i said , " to the @entity56 building on the @entity57 ? he ca n’t miss it "			0
' but they did send their driver - he could n’t find me			2
so subsequently i was three - quarters of an hour late			2
i was so late for lunch - embarrassingly late			2
' other guest presenters for the today programme include @entity200 on monday , @entity202 boss @entity201 on tuesday and musician @entity203 on thursday and sir @entity204			1
sir @entity204 today revealed how the @entity188 prevented him from commissioning an atheist to give the @entity208 item			2
the man credited with inventing the internet guest - edited the @entity211 broadcast of @entity25 's today programme			1
but when he explained to programme bosses about his plans for the @entity208 slot , he was told only a religious leader would do			2
asked about how he coped with editing the programmed , he said : ' @entity208 was an interesting point			0
there i was saying if we have a thought , why ca n’t it be a thought from an atheist ? ' i ’m very sensitive about it - the background and a certain amount of discrimination about it around the world against atheists - and wondered whether it was my duty to poke a bit at the @entity188 and its tradition			0
' but an atheist was invited to deliver an ' alternative thought for the day ' because the usual slot was part of the @entity188 's religious programming and therefore could not be given by an atheist .			0
