the world is finally in the grip of a long - awaited @entity3 event that could alter global weather patterns - but the phenomenon is far weaker than expected			1
scientists have announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central @entity9 and have started to alter wind patterns			1
the @entity11 now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance @entity3 will continue through the summer			1
the @entity11 and @entity14 has detected warmer than average water surface temperatures around the equator of the @entity9 ( shown above ) which indicates the arrival of @entity3 however , they say that the @entity3 conditions are currently ' extremely weak ' and come at a time of the year when the influence of @entity3 on weather patterns usually declines			1
this means that while @entity3 conditions normally brings wetter weather to the northern hemisphere in the summer , it is unlikely to be bring substantially more rainfall than this spring			1
@entity3 is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the @entity9 around the equator			1
usually the wind blows strongly from east to west , due to the rotation of the @entity34 , causing water to pile up in the western part of the @entity9			2
this pulls up colder water from the deep ocean in the eastern @entity9			2
however , in an @entity3 , the winds pushing the water get weaker and cause the warmer water to shift back towards the east			1
this causes the eastern @entity9 to get warmer			0
but as the ocean temperature is linked to the wind currents , this causes the winds to grow weaker still and so the ocean grows warmer , meaning the @entity3 grows			1
this change in air and ocean currents around the equator can have a major impact on the weather patterns around the globe by creating pressure anomalies in the atmosphere			0
the @entity11 said that it was unlikely the phenomenon would bring enough rain this spring to break the three - year record - breaking drought that is currently affecting @entity63			2
some meteorologists , however , have warned that this @entity3 could combine with another slow movement of water temperature in the @entity9 called the @entity67 ( @entity67 )			1
the @entity67 reached record levels in december last year and january this year , and should it stay strong , it may combine with @entity3 to increase global temperatures			1
@entity70 , deputy director of @entity11 's @entity71 , said : ' based on the persistent observations of above - average sea surface temperatures across the western and central equatorial @entity9 and consistent pattern of sea level pressure , we can now say that @entity3 is here			1
' many climate prediction models show this weak @entity3 continuing into summer			0
' the arrival of this @entity3 is considered to be late after scientists last year predicted they were expecting one last year , but the conditions failed to materialise			1
according to the @entity83 conditions generally bring warmer temperatures to @entity85 during the @entity86 and colder winter temperatures			0
the above diagram shows the sea surface temperature ( @entity90 ) in the @entity9 on 25 feburary 2015 and it can be seen that around the equator the temperature was above average ( marked by red ) on that date it can also make sourthern @entity85 wetter during the late summer and autumn			2
perhaps the greatest impact is felt in the monsoon regions of south east @entity99 where the climate is usually drier than normal in @entity3 years			0
@entity3 is one of the most powerful climate altering phenonoma on the planet			0
it is the result of the @entity3 , which is the cycle of warm and cold water across the @entity9			1
this cycle occurs at intervals of between two to seven years and can last for nine months to two years			0
when the ocean is warmer than average for seven to nine months , the @entity11 officially classes it as @entity3 conditions			1
@entity63 is in the midst of the worst drought in 1,200 years and has caused severe drying of the @entity115 ( shown above )			0
it is unlikely the @entity3 will bring enough spring rain to ease the drought the last @entity3 , in 2009 - 2010 , was a moderate to strong event			0
this brought freezing weather to northern @entity85 in the winter of 2009/2010 and the @entity123 was exceptionally cold			0
the @entity124 also suffered a far warmer than average winter during the same event			0
other recent @entity3 ’s in 2002 - 2003 , 2004 - 2005 and 2006 - 2007 have been weak to moderate in strength			0
the last very strong @entity3 was 1997 - 1998 and was known for providing heavy rainfall in the west of the @entity130 , especially @entity63			0
the @entity11 said that last week the sea temperature across much of the equatorial @entity9 has been above average			1
they also found that unusually weak easterly winds have persisted across the eastern @entity9			0
in @entity136 and february there were a couple of westerly wind bursts of over the central tropical @entity9 and forecasts for march suggest these will continue			0
the @entity11 said that this mean the @entity141 , which is uses to monitor the @entity3 , has been a negative value for the second month in a row			2
the above diagram shows the impacts of a typical @entity3 on seasonal temperatures around the world the above diagram shows how a typical @entity3 is expected to change seasonal rainfall around the world in a blog post on the onset of @entity3 , the @entity11 said : ' at this time , these are extremely weak @entity3 conditions , during a time of year when the influence of @entity3 on weather patterns in @entity157 or other locations outside of the @entity159 is weakening			1
' from an impacts perspective , this is not particularly momentous , as @entity3 impacts are weak in the spring and summer			0
' still , after months of hovering under the threshold , we can now say that @entity3 conditions have arrived			1
' @entity11 scientists are to continue monitoring the situation and will issue an update in april			0
however , @entity168 , a meteorologist writing for @entity169 , warned that the arrival of @entity3 could result in this year being especially warm			2
he said : ' @entity3 transfers huge amounts of heat from the oceans to the atmosphere , and there are hints that this @entity3 , combined with the already very warm global oceans , could bring about a new phase in global warming			2
' an associated slow - moving indicator of @entity9 temperatures , called the @entity182 ( @entity67 ) , reached record levels in december and january			2
' a persistently strong pdo is associated with cold winters in the eastern @entity130 and drought in @entity63 – we 've had both in abundance this year			0
' should the @entity67 stay strong , it will essentially join forces with @entity3 and increase the odds that 2015 will rank as the warmest year on record globally			2

@entity11 declares warmer than average water in @entity9 signal the arrival of @entity3 conditions
they predict there is a 50 **%** *-60* **%** chance @entity3 will continue this summer
however this year 's @entity3 is currently far weaker than in previous events
some meteorologists warn @entity3 could combine with another 10 year ocean warming cycle to produce record global temperatures this year
experts had expected @entity3 to start last year but it did not materialise
