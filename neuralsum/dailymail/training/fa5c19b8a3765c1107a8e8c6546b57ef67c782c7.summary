@entity208 surface - to - air missiles have also been showcased at @entity209 , in south east @entity210 , as part of the massive 2012 security test on land , sea and in the air			1
ready to protect : a @entity202 helicopter flies lands on @entity199 the flagship @entity199 off @entity192 and @entity193 is being prepared for the @entity186 the @entity202 's show of force was part of the massive 2012 security test on land , sea and in the air colonel @entity222 , commander of the @entity223 , said : ' we have done as much as we can to allay people 's fears			2
' the @entity208 system has a world - class radar on it and is particularly good at picking up low and slow - moving objects in the sky			1
' it means we 're able to get the very best picture of what is happening in the skies of @entity210			2
' @entity237 @entity236 added : ' we want the focus to be on @entity239 this summer and not us			2
we 're very proud to be part of this plan to deliver a safe and secure @entity186			0
' the @entity242 in @entity243 and the @entity244 in @entity245 , both in east @entity210 , have been identified as potential sites for the @entity247			0
@entity208 missiles would be positioned on @entity249 and in @entity250 , both in south east @entity210 , and at @entity251 in @entity252 and @entity253 at @entity254 in @entity255 , both in north @entity210 , should the @entity256 be approved by the government			0
col @entity222 said the sites had been chosen to avoid having weapons inside the @entity74			0
he said : ' we 're trying to de-militarise this and let the sport do the talking			0
the @entity242 is the best available location away from the @entity74			0
' ' when you launch a @entity208 missile and shoot down an aircraft , it 's not like the whole thing vanishes			0
it 's 100 tons of metal , scraps , and other stuff that is coming down , ' said @entity274 , a retired @entity275 captain who is director of the @entity277 - based @entity276			1
' if a @entity208 is used , the damage could be just about the same as the intentions of the terrorist - only on another spot			1
the goal of the terrorists will be met in a certain sense , ' @entity274 said			0
@entity286 commandos in rigid inflatables wait to rejoin the @entity202 flagship @entity199 a soldier runs past the defence battery deployed at @entity249 the military demonstrate some of the air defence weapons that may be utilised to protect @entity210 during the @entity186 it 's rare for the @entity47 military to publicise the location of its weapons , but the military says it hopes that any potential attacks will be deterred by showing the missile strength and other defense assets such as @entity301 fighter jets			0
ground - to - air missiles have been a fixture of olympic games and large vip events in the post- 9/11 world , but @entity210 's missiles have sparked outrage among residents of an apartment block who learned that the @entity208 might be stationed on their roof			2
they say the missiles are creating a climate of fear - which security experts say is exactly the point			2
that 's because the systems are more valuable as deterrents than as deployed weapons , mr @entity274 said			0
' the @entity47 army and air force do n't do all this to really shoot down a terrorist aircraft , they do it to display their determination to do so , which will hopefully prevent the terrorists from attacking , ' mr @entity274 said			0
' if you know that there are 500 policeman outside the jewellery store , you will not go there and try to rob the store			0
' the @entity337 it has not decided where it will ultimately station the missile batteries			0

the movie tells the story of the pair who were born when two drops of molten steel feel as building work finishes on the @entity32			0
once cooled they are picked up by a man named @entity355			0
back home he decides to make a gift for his grandchildren out of the steel drops			0
the two children take the mascots up to the attic and place them on the windowsill when a rainbow forms going through the house			0
the rainbow brings @entity345 and @entity345 to colour and to life where they learn about sport from the children , posters and the tv			0
the story which features @entity136 athletes ends with the words : ' then suddenly the rainbow disbanded ; wenlock and @entity345 know it ’s time to go , their journey is just beginning			0
so many adventures to have , so many people to tell , but they will meet again ; in @entity210 , in 2012			0
they ’ll be there , you ’ll be there , the whole world will be there			0
