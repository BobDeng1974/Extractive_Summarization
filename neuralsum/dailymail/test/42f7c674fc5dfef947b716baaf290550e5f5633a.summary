gruesome death rituals performed 1,200 years ago have been uncovered in dozens of tombs in @entity3 's @entity2			1
each tomb was filled with bones of up to 60 mummies , with infants kept in small containers , and others repeatedly ripped to pieces while decomposing			1
archaeologists have so far opened up seven of the tombs , recovering 171 broken mummies from the ancient ceremonial site known as @entity15			1
gruesome death rituals performed 1,200 years ago have been uncovered in dozens of tombs in @entity3 's @entity2			1
pictured is the burial of a young woman found in the middle of one of the tombs			1
analysis of her skeletal remains reveal that she suffered dental problems , including the loss of teeth ' when we think of the dead , we bury the relative and that 's it , ' @entity29 , a curator at @entity31 's @entity30 told @entity35			2
' but back then , in the @entity37 , you continued to interact with those folks			2
people were moving bodies around all the time			1
' the mummies in the tombs ranged in age from several days old to the elderly			1
but over the years rats had eaten away many of the remains , leaving only fragments			2
in one tomb , researchers discovered 400 isolated human body parts , including teeth , hands and feet			1
the few mummies that remained intact were bound by rope and placed in a foetal position			2

the mummies were buried with a variety of items including some beautifally decorated ceramic , pictured pictured is the partial skull of an individual found in one of the seven opened tombs			1
the dead , numbering in the low thousands , towered over the living from in their tombs high on the hills around the valley ' on occasion , there were mummies that were placed as offerings around the outside of the tombs , ' said @entity29			1
the @entity88 period ( a.d. 600 – 1000 ) was a time of sweeping cultural change in the @entity37			0
archaeologists have long associated this period with the expansion of the @entity93 in the south - central @entity37 and coastal area of modern - day @entity3			0
along with their expansion , came widespread violence			0
skull fragments in some areas of their territory reveal that 50 per cent had dents in their heads caused by violent blows			0
pottery in these areas were etched with drawings of fanged teeth and human trophy skulls			1
but @entity109 was believed to have been a relatively peaceful area in @entity3 at that time			0
in @entity112 , only one per cent of skulls had dents			0
the pottery at the site is also decorated with what looks like depictions of people smiling			1
@entity15 may have served as a ' neutral ground ' where people could bury their dead and feast			1
' they were broken apart but then placed back together in an anatomically correct position			0
' scientists are still trying to understand why some of the mummies and artefacts were broken up in this way			0
one theory is that the movement of the mummies may have helped create a sense of equality among the community			1
there is also evidence that the rituals went on for days at a time , with parties being held in the valley below the tombs			1
@entity29 said that the dead , likely numbering in the low thousands , towered over the living from in their tombs high on the hills around the valley			1
' it seems to be a place where people were bringing down their dead to that location , ' said @entity29			0
' they were having parties			0
there is evidence that they were making and drinking corn beer , and placing offerings underneath them			0
' but he adds that the picture remains blurry , as the rituals were performed over many years , and likely changed during that time			0
a study of pottery at the site suggests it was used between about a.d. 800 and a.d. 1000 , with the @entity165 settling there 500 years later			1
@entity109 was believed to have been a relatively peaceful area in @entity3 during those years			0
pictured is a dismembered mummy			0
a tupu , which was an artifact that could have been used to fasten clothing , fell through this mummy ’s rib cage when it was moved @entity15 appears to have been created as a place where people from nearby villages could feast			1
parties , that lasted for several days at a time , were often held in the valley below the tombs			1
this image shows a storage area where food for feasting could have been kept pictured are some of the decorated cups found in the tombs			2
human hands , lines , dots and happy faces can be seen			2
pottery found in other parts of @entity3 had more gruesome images , largely due to a culture of violence the wider area , however , was undergoing dramatic change , with populations growing , agriculture expanding and class differences emerging			2
at this time , the @entity200 was being established in the south - central @entity37 and coastal area of modern - day @entity3			0
and with it came widespread violence			0
skull fragments on the islands close by revealed that 50 per cent had dents in their heads caused by violent blows			0
pottery in these areas were etched with drawings of fanged teeth and human trophy skulls			2
in @entity112 , only one per cent of skulls had dents			0
the pottery at the site is also decorated with what looks like depictions of people smiling			2
jennings believe @entity109 may have served as a ' neutral ground ' where people could bury their dead and feast			0
' we have finished the excavations , and we 're now trying to look at a different sites nearby during the same period to understand the relationship , ' @entity29 added			0
@entity229 near the city of @entity231 in @entity3 is the deepest canyon in the world , and a site of archaeological significance			2
the canyon is an impressive chasm that the river has eroded between two enormous mountain massifs : the @entity238 and the @entity239 scientists are still trying to understand reasons why some of the mummies and artefacts were broken up in this way			0
one theory is that the movement of the mummies may have helped create a sense of equality among the community			1

tombs discovered at a ceremonial site , @entity15 in @entity2
infants were kept in small containers , and others had limbs removed
in one tomb , researchers discovered 400 isolated human body parts
the movement of bodies may have helped create a sense of equality
