by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 10:52 am on 18th october 2011 case drags on : race hate cleric @entity3 is fighting an extradition bid to the @entity5 @entity7 human rights judges are costing the @entity9 taxpayer millions of pounds by stalling the extradition of six of the world ’s most wanted @entity13 terror suspects			1
the independent panel that has been reviewing extradition laws will today accuse the @entity17 of being inefficient and slow			1
the six terror suspects – who include hook - handed cleric @entity3 – have been languishing in @entity9 jails for a combined total of almost 50 years			0
the cost to the taxpayer of their incarceration alone is an estimated £ 2.5million			0
they are accused of running terror training camps , plotting atrocities and running extremist websites			1
but the controversial @entity7 court has halted their extradition to the @entity5 in case their human rights are breached by lengthy jail sentences			1
the court has allowed their cases to drag on for years			2
campaigners point to the stark difference between the way the court has dealt with terror suspects and its treatment of @entity44 ’s sufferer @entity45			1
@entity45 , who searched @entity47 computers from his @entity49 home looking for evidence of ‘ little green men ’ , is facing extradition to the @entity5 on computer hacking charges			1
still fighting : @entity45 , left , is facing extradition to the @entity5 on computer hacking charges			1
his mother @entity57 , right , is leading the attack against the @entity59 @entity60 has broken a lot of promises , but it is the @entity63 leader ’s failure to honour his pledge to fight for @entity45 that many people find most appalling			1
in opposition he claimed to be one of @entity45 's biggest supporters but fast forward to 2010 when he was lording it over the country as deputy prime minister and he said the case has nothing to do with him			1
shamefully , he even refused to meet with @entity45 ’s mum , @entity57 , to discuss the case , writes @entity76			1
read more here but the @entity7 judges dismissed his appeal against extradition in little more than a day			1
@entity45 ’s extradition , under the @entity59 , is the subject of the @entity85 ’s ‘ an @entity83 to @entity9 justice ’ campaign			1
it was temporarily halted by home secretary @entity88 last year			0
she wants to examine advice on whether the 45 - year - old is fit to be sent abroad			0
today the review panel , established by the @entity92 and led by lord justice @entity93 , will urge ministers to put pressure on the @entity97 court to reform the way it works			2
in particular , it wants cases to be dealt with much more quickly			0
the government , which has been embroiled in a long row with the court over votes for prisoners , will jump at the chance to issue a rebuke to the judges over terror			2
the @entity85 has learnt that the six cases involve terror suspects that the @entity5 is desperate to put on trial			0
they include hate - preacher @entity3 and his trusted lieutenant @entity114 – who are wanted by the @entity5 authorities for allegedly plotting to set up a jihad training camp in @entity117			2
@entity3 ’s case alone has already cost the public purse £ 1.1million in legal aid			2
he was jailed for seven years in february 2006 for preaching hate and inciting murder at @entity123 in @entity49			0
he would be eligible for release but remains in jail while his extradition case continues			0
if @entity97 rules definitively that he can not be extradited , officials would have little option but to release him on to @entity9 ’s streets			0
two other men , @entity132 and @entity133 , are accused of conspiracy to commit terrorist atrocities overseas and supporting terrorist groups			2
they have been held in @entity9 jails – at a cost of £ 50,000 each per year – for between five and seven years while they fight extradition on human rights grounds			0
another man , @entity141 , who is considered one of the @entity5 ’s most wanted terror suspects , has been in jail here since 1999			0
allegedly an associate of @entity146 , he was arrested over bomb attacks on two @entity5 embassies in @entity149 which killed more than 200 in 1998			0
the sixth man , @entity150 , is also wanted in connection with the embassy bombings and has been held in prison for 13 years			0
all have exhausted their rights of appeal in @entity9 courts and are being held in high - security detention			0
the @entity7 court has stalled extradition on the grounds that the lengthy jail terms they face if convicted may breach their human rights			1
last night @entity45 ’s mother , @entity57 , told the @entity85 : ‘ we appealed to the @entity7 court one night and the next day they refused to consider it			1
it was literally rejected overnight			0
‘ this treaty [ the @entity59 ] was meant for terrorists but it is not being applied to terrorists and it ’s not terrorists being extradited			2
all this treaty is doing is uprooting vulnerable people , like @entity45			2

independent panel will accuse @entity7 court of being inefficient and slow
terrorists accused of plotting atrocities and running extremist websites and camps
same judges dismissed @entity44 ’s sufferer @entity45 's appeal case in a day
