@entity0 yesterday unveiled a raft of controversial powers to drive @entity4 extremists from @entity6 public life – including the closure of mosques which harbour fanatics			1
the home secretary said @entity6 had tolerated extremist views for too long and hardliners needed to understand the ' game is up ' for anybody who rejects @entity6 values			1
her wish - list included sending hit squads modelled on the government 's @entity19 into ' isolated ' communities to teach @entity22 and encourage children to mix with youngsters from other backgrounds			2
home secretary @entity0 ( above ) will promise to drive out the ' significant ' number of fanatics who have been able to infiltrate @entity6 establishments as the @entity30 revealed yesterday , there will also be new civil orders to silence preachers of hate , a review of sharia courts and new rules making it easier to ban extremist groups			1
closure orders for mosques or other premises hosting extremist meetings blacklist of people and bodies public sector should not engage with all foreign religious workers in pastoral roles required to speak @entity22 orders making it unlawful to preach hate in public or on the internet banning orders for extremist groups that fall short of existing terrorist proscription thresholds migrants arriving on visas must declare they will respect @entity6 values independent review of operation of sharia courts @entity62 on asylum for terror suspects translation services cut public spending on translation services will be cut to encourage all muslims to speak @entity22			1
it will be a requirement for religious workers with pastoral responsibilities to learn the language			2
meanwhile , a new @entity73 is being established inside the @entity74 to draw up a blacklist of individuals and organisations which the public sector should not engage with			2
mrs may said the aim was to ensure ' nobody unwittingly lends legitimacy or credibility to extremists ' and ensure ministers do n't just speak to ' self - appointed and often unrepresentative community leaders '			2
closure orders would be served on any premises owned or occupied by extremists or used to host extremist speakers – including mosques			1
she called for a new partnership to defeat the fanatics , saying : ' to those who do not want to join this new partnership , to those who choose consciously to reject our values and the basic principles of our society , the message is equally clear : the game is up			1
we will no longer tolerate your behaviour			2
' mrs may told @entity107 hardliners : ' the game is up			1
we will no longer tolerate your behaviour			2
we will expose your hateful beliefs for what they are ' mrs may is expected to set out priorities for a @entity114 government - including a review of @entity117 courts and powers to stop preachers of hate like @entity121 ( pictured ) from public speaking or using social media lord @entity124 policy failures are partly to blame for @entity127 extremism in @entity6 , @entity124 claimed yesterday			1
the @entity129 grandee , who has been recruited into the party 's election campaign by @entity132 , said events in the @entity134 could have radicalised him too			0
' any young @entity4 would be affected by the indiscriminate killing either by @entity136 or @entity138 military technology , ' he said			0
' this kind of crusade started with the invasion of @entity142 and the overthrow of an elected @entity4 government in @entity145 , and continues with @entity146			0
' he said young @entity4 would inevitably ' identify and seek to support what they perceive as their cause and their people '			0
in his @entity152 column he added : ' perhaps we might find their radicalisation is more to do with their sense of justice and what they 've seen on the television and in the papers			0
' but @entity162 of @entity163 said @entity124 was guilty of a cynical rant			0
' these words are incredible coming from someone who was deputy prime minister , ' added the politics professor			0
' he shows a complete misunderstanding of historical facts and of the present danger which the country faces			0
lord @entity124 is deliberately fanning the flames			0
his facts are mixed up			0
' lord @entity124 served under @entity174 through the 2003 invasion of @entity142 and the @entity6 military intervention in @entity177 , before leaving office in 2007			1
@entity114 mps welcomed her uncompromising stance in which she criticised those who sought to excuse @entity107 extremism as mere ' social conservatism '			1
but , published less than two months before the election , her plan is a list of ambitions rather than a blueprint for @entity189			0
the measures will be included in the @entity114 manifesto but , in the event of a new coalition , would be fiercely resisted by the @entity194			1
the speech was seen at @entity196 as a reminder of mrs may 's leadership credentials if @entity200 stands down after the election			0
mps said it had echoes of @entity205 , who once declared : ' where there is discord , may we bring harmony			0
' comparisons were also made with @entity174 's 12 - point plan for tackling terror , unveiled in the aftermath of the 7/7 attacks			0
the @entity129 prime minister famously declared that the ' rules of the game are changing ' but later abandoned his own proposal for mosque closure orders after a backlash from @entity4 groups			1
mrs may 's plans follow a series of bitter rows inside the @entity193 over counter-terrorism strategy			2
the @entity194 have made it clear they will oppose any attempt to limit free speech			0
at least four @entity114 cabinet ministers , including education secretary @entity230 and communities secretary @entity231 , are also understood to have argued the strategy needs more work			1
the proposals drew an angry response from some @entity4 groups			0
@entity238 chairman @entity237 said : ' nobody will be fooled by the home secretary 's claims that these measures are designed to tackle extremism			1
' they are a shameless expression of a hate and bigotry that is increasingly becoming normalised in @entity6			1
' @entity248 , chairman of the @entity249 think tank , said the proposals would infringe people 's freedom of speech			0
shadow home secretary @entity254 said : ' everyone other than the extremists agrees we should robustly defend and actively promote the pluralistic values our society rightly holds in esteem			1
but it is n't enough for the home secretary to say it , she needs to act			1
' the @entity74 defines extremism as ' vocal or active opposition to fundamental @entity6 values including democracy , the rule of law , individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs '			2
it also includes ' calls for the death of members of armed forces whether in this country or overseas ' .			0
