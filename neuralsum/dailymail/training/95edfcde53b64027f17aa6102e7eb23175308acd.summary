less than twenty miles from @entity3 , in the glamorous seaside city of @entity1 , @entity2 , is the one and a half mile patch of shore dubbed ' @entity7			0
' the deepest and driest and most picturesque of the exclusive area 's beaches , @entity11 , as it is properly known , has attracted some of the most affluent and influential residents around			1
the sandy strip boasts beach getaways owned by record mogul @entity16 , former @entity18 chief executive @entity17 , and @entity20 chief executive @entity19			1
golden sands.jpg it also has been home to many movie stars , including @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
top architects including @entity27 and @entity28 built many of the residences			0
the beach 's nickname , it seems , is an apt one and everyday beach goers have , for years , been unwelcome in the luxury playground			2
however , access to the exclusive strip of sand will soon become easier as a @entity1 homeowner settles a decade - long legal battle that will result in a paved path to @entity11			1
obstacles : @entity44 had put up several impediments that blocked beach - goers from accessing the strip of sand , including large boulders , a fence , a wall and a tennis court high - class beach : luxurious beach houses crowd the shoreline hiding @entity11 , commonly known as ' billionaire ' beach ' case closed : @entity44 has settled a longstanding dispute allow residents to access the exclusive @entity11 through her @entity1 property one of the beach 's residents , @entity44 , has settled a longstanding dispute with the @entity66 over beach access , the commission said friday			1
@entity44 , the widow of @entity69 developer @entity68 and the daughter of @entity71 , founder of financial - services company @entity72 , has agreed to pay $ 1.1million and construct a paved pathway to be built by the end of 2014 from the @entity75 across her property to the beach			1
the @entity66 had been fighting since the early 2000s to get @entity44 to comply with easements , or public rights of way , on her property			2
@entity44 sued the commission in 2009 in an attempt to overturn a cease - and - desist order it had filed to force her to clear the easements			2
broken promises : @entity44 had agreed to provide a public pathway to the beach as a condition of a development permit the family received in the 1980s that allowed them to build a mansion , three - car garage , tennis courts and pool the disagreement underscores the difficulty of making good on a principal enshrined in @entity2 's constitution : that the state 's beaches are public			1
unfair : music mogul @entity16 had spent years fighting to prevent use of a walkway on his property along the same stretch of @entity1 before settling in 2005 but private landowners are not always required to allow access to the coastline across their property , and many disputes have arisen over the years - often involving wealthy beachfront homeowners			1
in a similar case in northern @entity2 , beach lovers on thursday staged a protest at @entity120 's @entity119			0
the access road has been closed since soon after the property was bought by venture capitalist @entity123 in 2008			0
earlier this week , @entity124 , a coastal protection group , filed a lawsuit to open access to @entity128 's beach , arguing that closing the approach amounted to a violation of the state 's @entity131 , which governs issues including shoreline access			2
in @entity44 's case , she had been fighting two easements dating from the 1980s that provided for beach access on her property			1
she had put up several impediments that blocked the easements , including large boulders , a fence , a wall and a tennis court			0
a 2011 order from a @entity150 judge required her to clear the right of way , but @entity44 appealed the decision			0
late last year , the state @entity154 declined to hear the case			0
‘ although the @entity66 and i disagreed for several years about the meaning of the terms of the permits governing my property , i am pleased that the matter has been resolved , ’ @entity44 said in a press release			0
she also said she was pleased the access would be compliant with the @entity164 , ‘ something of great importance to me and my late husband			0
’ famous neighbors : the exclusive @entity11 has been home to actors @entity23 , left , and @entity24 and @entity25 , right a lawyer for @entity44 , @entity172 , referred a caller back to her statement in the press release			1
‘ it 's unfortunate that so much time , and so many resources had to be wasted over the last decade trying to get the public their rightful access to the beach , ’ said @entity176 , chairwoman of the @entity66			1
‘ but this is an outcome we can all feel proud of , and we are grateful to mrs @entity44 for stepping forward and doing the right thing for the people of @entity2			0
’ the dispute echoes record mogul @entity188 's long battle to prevent use of a walkway on his property along the same stretch of @entity1			2
in 1983 , @entity188 agreed to allow a pathway to @entity11 when he sought permits for a pool and other additions , but he later filed suit to fight the access			0
in 2005 , @entity16 settled the suit and allowed the public to use the walkway .			0

@entity11 is a *1.5* mile stretch of sandy , exclusive luxury and has been home to heavy hitters like @entity16 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity209 , @entity210 , and @entity211
a drawn - out court battle over public access to the beach has resulted in a *victory* for the common man that forces homeowner @entity44 to remove impediments she 's built that block public access to the beach
