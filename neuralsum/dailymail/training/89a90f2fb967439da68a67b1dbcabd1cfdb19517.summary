' now i glue hand made paper with long fibres together using methyl - cellulose , a kind of wallpaper paste			0
' the long fibres prevent tearing , and allow me to fold the paper slightly damp			0
' the later technique makes it easier to fold creases that are not so sharp , and use the paper more like clay to sculpt forms			0
