by @entity0 president @entity1 of @entity2 is committing systematic mass murder using his regime 's ' @entity4 ' resulting in atrocities not seen since the @entity7 claims the @entity9 's chief war crimes official			1
nearly 30,000 photographs have been compiled as evidence of the @entity2 government 's torture , murder and starvation of 10,000 civilians in custody described as akin to genocide and the worst since the @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity21 , the @entity9 's ambassador - at - large for @entity22 has seen the huge collection of photographic evidence smuggled out of @entity2 by an intelligence operative known only as ' @entity26 ' and told @entity27 he was shocked and appalled			1
crimes against humanity : @entity31 chemical weapons experts , wearing gas masks , holding a plastic bag containing samples from one of the sites of an alleged chemical weapons attack in the @entity39 neighbourhood of @entity40 in this august 29 , 2013 file photo ' this is solid evidence of the kind of machinery of cruel death that we have n’t seen frankly since the @entity19 , ' he said			0
' if it is as it appears thus far , we ’re talking about more than 10,000 individuals being killed in custody over the period from 2011 to 2013 , including largely men but also some very , very young men and boys and women … it ’s shocking to me , as a prosecutor — i ’m used to evidence not being so strong			1
' accused : a new report being examined and verified by the @entity9 accuses president @entity64 of committing crimes against humanity @entity21 said that @entity1 regime is committing crimes against humanity and has called upon the @entity71 administration to take action against @entity2 government forces			1
another war crimes prosecutor told @entity27 that he believes the vast collection of photographs reveals indirect ' @entity78 government responsibility			1
' the shocking images were smuggled out of the country last year and emerged in january after a team of international war crimes prosecutors released their report			0
compiled by noted international war crimes prosecutors @entity86 , @entity87 , and @entity88 it said there was ' clear evidence , capable of being believed by a tribunal of fact in a court of law , of systematic torture and killing of detained persons by the agents of the @entity2 government ' that equalled war crimes and crimes against humanity			1
however , @entity78 foreign minister @entity103 has said that the report is not conclusive and has asked for independent verification because it was funded in part by the @entity108 government			1
meanwhile @entity21 said that the @entity110 government had nearly completed its own analysis of the 28,000 photographs and preliminary findings show that not only are they genuine but that they prove crimes against humanity			2
@entity118 , @entity2 --- people , affected by what activists say was a gas attack , receive treatment inside a makeshift hospital in @entity125 village in the central province of @entity118 may 22 , 2014 ' thus far the indication is that it would be impossible to have fabricated this kind of material , and having personally seen hundreds of the images of twisted bodies with real wounds and real human beings of every shape and size , this is not phony evidence , ' he said according to @entity27			1
' these bodies were brought to one location from 24 other facilities , in which they had been tortured to death in a variety of ways : ligature strangulation , burning , bruising , starvation , evisceration , the most horrendous things you can imagine			0
' @entity21 admitted that since @entity1 was not attempting to kill one particular set of people that this is not technically genocide			0
however , @entity21 told @entity27 that his crimes against humanity are so heinous that they fit past definitions of genocide			0
@entity21 added that @entity1 is legally linked to the crimes because as head of the @entity2 government and military he is in command and therefore is responsible			1
it is not clear when the @entity9 and president @entity71 will be willing to comment on their final review of the images			1
international war crimes scholar @entity166 — who led the @entity31 investigations into war crimes in @entity170 , @entity171 , and @entity172 , and helped create the @entity173 told @entity27 he sees the hand of @entity78 in some of the methods of torture			2
allies : a handout picture made available by @entity179 @entity179 shows @entity2 president @entity1 ( r ) meets with @entity181 ( @entity182 ) , deputy @entity78 foreign minister in @entity40 , @entity2 , 28 june 2014 ' we see a pattern of systematicity and discipline in the taking of the pictures , the numbering of the persons , etc. , which has never occurred before in the history of @entity2			1
it has occurred in @entity78 , ' he said			2
' if i compare the cultural practices of the @entity2 military in the past , their practice has always been to torture , kill , get rid of the bodies , get rid of the evidence			2
' when you look at the practices of the @entity204 and the eastern @entity206 countries , everything is documented			0
' there is however no proof of direct @entity78 involvement			2
if the international community chooses to accept the recommendations of the report then there are three options for future prosecutions of @entity1			0
the @entity216 could again attempt to refer @entity1 to the @entity173 , or a special inquiry set up			0
thirdly , if the revels win then @entity1 could be prosecuted within @entity2 itself			2
in @entity166 ’s view , the @entity110 will have to act if the evidence is deemed overwhelming			0
' it places a moral and legal burden on the @entity110			0
the moral burden is self - evident			0
' there is a point , ' @entity166 added , ' when you just ca n’t look the other way			0

@entity9 is reviewing almost 30,000 photographs obtained *secretly* from @entity2 *prisons*

investigators believe there is indirect @entity78 responsibility
