’ and @entity20 , @entity2 ’s sister , said it would be wrong for @entity15 or her ex-boyfriend @entity33 to remain at liberty			1

the best we can hope for is of course finally bringing this whole case to a conclusion			2

murdered : @entity2 's body was discovered in her bedroom in the picturesque @entity54 university town of @entity49 in november 2007 then this week , a court in @entity27 sensationally quashed that acquittal , reinstating the guilty verdict			1
mr @entity26 added : ‘ it would set a difficult precedent if the @entity6 did n’t uphold their own laws			0
' @entity6 obviously want a lot of people extradited			0
if @entity6 did n’t assist @entity12 they ’re going to have problems going the other way			0
’ @entity15 has made repeated overtures to the @entity26 family , writing in her multi-million pound memoir , waiting to be heard , that she hoped one day to meet them to assure them of her innocence			0
as the verdict approached , she wrote a letter to her lawyer which is addressed to miss @entity20 ’s family			0
she told @entity78 yesterday : ‘ it ’s in the mail			0
mainly i just want them to know that i really understand that this is incredibly difficult , that they ’ve also been on this never - ending thing and , when the case has been messed up so much , like , a verdict is no longer consolation for them			2
’ but the victim ’s sister , @entity20 , said her family did not want to read the letter			2
and she ruled out a meeting , even if @entity15 were one day acquitted			0
she said : ‘ it ’s not something that we would want to do at the moment and i ca n’t say that we ever will			0
‘ regardless now of a guilty or not guilty verdict , a lot has happened so it would be difficult to try and meet someone having had all that happen			0
’ the @entity104 have been forced to accept that they may never know what happened to @entity2 , she said			1
she added : ‘ i think we ’re still on a journey to the truth			0
it may be we do n’t ever really know what happened that night and that ’s something we ’ll have to come to terms with			0
‘ you ca n’t ever really get to a point where you just start to remember @entity2 solely , because it is following the case , coming over to @entity12 and everything associated with it			1
‘ but the verdict has been upheld this time so we hope that ... obviously , come the end of the trial , we are nearer the truth and an end so that we can just start to remember @entity2 for who she was and draw a line under it			1
’ @entity2 ’s parents @entity126 and @entity127 had desperately wanted to be at the trial , she said , but both have health problems and were not able to travel			2

@entity15 and then boyfriend @entity33 immediately came under suspicion because of their strange behaviour			0
after they were seen kissing and cuddling just yards from the murder scene investigators struck upon the theory of a sex game gone wrong			0
they were sentenced to 26 and 25 years jail respectively , after @entity33 ’s dna was found on a bra clasp belonging to @entity2 , and both girls ’ dna was found on the alleged murder weapon but four years later the couple were freed on appeal , after court - appointed experts dismissed much of the dna evidence linking the couple to the murder scene			1
