@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 has claimed @entity2 apologised for the ' dive ' that won @entity4 a penalty during their @entity7 fifth - round tie			1
@entity2 went down under a challenge by @entity0 in the 88th minute , and the @entity10 captain scored the resulting penalty to seal the 3 - 1 win over their @entity14 opposition on monday night			1
@entity17 presenter @entity15 and @entity18 were among those criticising @entity2 after replays showed there was no contact			1
@entity2 touched the ball past @entity1 goalkeeper @entity24 during the @entity7 tie @entity2 went down a moment after and several of the @entity1 players were unhappy with his actions @entity2 lies down on the ground before the penalty is given by referee @entity31 late on at @entity32 @entity2 scored from the spot - kick to put @entity4 3 - 1 up on monday night as they won the match ' after the game @entity2 told me : " sorry , it was my chance to get a penalty			1
i had to use that " , ' @entity0 told @entity40 @entity10 manager @entity42 was forced to defend his captain and @entity0 remains adamant it was an unfair call by referee @entity31			2
' i say it clear : that was no penalty , ' the keeper added			2
' i also believe that if the situation had happened the other way around , one of our strikers against the @entity4 keeper , the ref would n't have given the penalty			1
i have no doubt about that			0
' the goal was @entity2 's first in 952 minutes since scoring twice in the 3 - 1 win over @entity60 on @entity61 , and @entity4 will now face @entity62 in the @entity7 quarter - finals			1
@entity15 wrote this on @entity65 and discussed it further with @entity10 manager @entity42 on @entity67 @entity15 : @entity42 , he 's your captain			1
was he diving there ? @entity42 : no , not for me , he 's just taking evasive action			0
if you 're refereeing the game without the replays that we 've seen now a number of times , i do n't think any of us would have said that 's not a penalty			2
the goalkeeper 's come out that way very rashly and gone with both feet , and @entity2 's touched the ball past him			1
@entity85 : but he has n't touched him @entity42 ? @entity42 : well ... there you go @entity90 : well there ’s no contact			0
it ’s a rash challenge yes , but there ’s no contact			2
he tries to leave his leg in there as well , just looking for it			0
@entity100 : i think when the keeper ’s flying in like that he has to get out of the way			0
and yeah you might say it ’s a dive , but i think he had to get out of the way because if he had left his leg in there it ’d have been a leg - breaker			0
@entity110 : it ’s still a dive though			0
@entity100 : he had to dive to get out of the way , though			0
@entity110 : but it ’s a dive , @entity115 @entity100 : he had to get out of the way otherwise he ’d have snapped his leg			0
@entity110 : he can hurdle the challenge though ca n’t he , and then continue his run			0
@entity100 : it ’s a penalty for me – it ’s a reckless challenge			2
