by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 21:08 est , 16 december 2012 updated : 05:21 est , 18 december 2012 mps last night voiced grave concerns over the arrest of a policeman accused of leaking details of @entity9 ’s foul - mouthed ‘ pleb ’ rant			1
@entity11 said a constable in the @entity13 was held on suspicion of misconduct in public office relating to the leaking of details of the former chief whip ’s confrontation with officers at the gates of @entity22 in september			1
but the decision prompted anger among both rank - and - file officers and @entity3 – with critics warning the episode raised ‘ chilling ’ questions about the ability of whistle - blowers to go public with their concerns			1
last night it also emerged that another mp has been dragged into the inquiry after the @entity47 said the officer under investigation may have spoken to their local member of parliament about what happened outside the no 10 gates			1
a report into press standards by @entity55 , published last month , recommended banning so called ‘ off the record ’ conversations between police officers and journalists			2
at the time , critics said this could deter potential whistle - blowers who may be too scared to reveal potentially important information for fear of being arrested			2
last night @entity38 mp @entity66 said : ‘ officials should not be arrested for leaking information they believe to be in the public interest			1
' i can understand why the police might want to discipline someone who leaked information but it would be a very sad day if that were ever held to be a crime			0
scandal : mr @entity9 was forced to resign after pressure from mps aand members of the @entity81 ‘ i believe in free speech and a free press and i see no reason why stories of this kind should not be printed			1
‘ we could either end up in a situation where this kind of thing is explicitly not allowed , or there would be a chilling effect in which the media and public officials become too scared of the consequences			0
’ a police log of the confrontation , details of which were leaked to two newspapers , is widely seen as costing mr @entity9 his job in october			1
he maintained yesterday the police account of the affair , reproduced right , was ‘ false ’ and insists he never used the word ‘ pleb ’			0
@entity107 mp @entity106 said : ‘ this raises big concerns about the freedom of whistle - blowers who are meant to be protected			0
' it was without question in the public interest this information came out			0
it begs questions about what ’s going on			0
it has all the characteristics of a witch - hunt			0
’ the @entity81 said the arrest was ‘ disproportionate ’ and of ‘ great regret ’			2
the @entity47 is supervising the investigation by @entity11			0
the police watchdog said the arrested officer allegedly witnessed mr @entity9 insulting a policeman outside @entity22 while he was off duty			1
he is then thought to have told an mp about what he had seen			0
mr @entity9 resigned in october after weeks of controversy over what he was reported to have said to police after being told he could not ride his bike through the main gates			1
@entity11 said the arrest resulted from fresh information following a previous investigation in september			2
‘ these inquiries found no evidence to suggest any of the officers involved in the incident were involved in the unauthorised release of information			2
the officer arrested was not on duty at the time of the incident in @entity22			1
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
