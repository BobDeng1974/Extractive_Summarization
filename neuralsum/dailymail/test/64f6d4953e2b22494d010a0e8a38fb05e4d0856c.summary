the @entity7 leader said a second independence poll ' ai n't going to happen ' even if he becomes prime minister with the support of @entity8 mps next month			1

he said the @entity8 were ' determined to prise apart the @entity24 '			2
former foreign secretary @entity25 added that @entity8 could be ' calling the tune ' if @entity0 became pm on the back of @entity8 support			2
he said this would mean : ' the people who want to break up the @entity24 will be running the @entity24			0
' but mr @entity0 this morning accused the @entity32 of ' threatening the integrity of the @entity24 ' by talking up the prospects of @entity2 nationalists in the may 7 general election			0
the @entity7 leader insisted there would be no coalition with the @entity8 and flatly ruled out holding another referendum			1

' the @entity7 leader said a second independence poll ' ai n't going to happen ' even if he becomes prime minister with the support of @entity8 mps next month @entity49 leader mr @entity0 addresses an audience during a campaign stop in @entity52 this morning mr @entity0 said mr @entity53 had been ' talking up ' the @entity8 in the hope that it would take votes and seats from @entity7 north of the border and allow him to ' crawl back ' into 10 @entity58			1
' i think @entity53 is playing fast and loose with the @entity24 , ' said the @entity7 leader			1
' this is somebody who has given up hope of winning a majority			0
he is trying to boost the @entity8			0
' i think @entity53 is now threatening the integrity of the @entity24 with the games he is playing			0
and i think conservatives are now ashamed of what he is doing			0
' mr @entity0 cited @entity70 former cabinet minister @entity69 who has warned that the party 's tactic of targeting a @entity7 - @entity8 link - up was ' short - term and dangerous ' and could ultimately damage the @entity75			1
in a @entity19 interview last night , the @entity7 leader insisted he would not be dictated to by the nationalists , even if he had to govern without an overall majority in the new parliament			1
but sir @entity15 said that , in practice , mr @entity0 would be forced to accede to the @entity8 's demands or face the collapse of his government			1
' if @entity7 were to accept an offer of support from the @entity8 , it could put the country on course to a government held to ransom on a vote - by - vote basis , ' he said			1
mr @entity0 's intervention came as the former prime minister @entity15 warned that the @entity8 was ' merely waiting for a good excuse to put separation back on the agenda ' sir @entity15 added : ' @entity7 would be in hock to a party that - slowly but surely - will push them ever further to the left			1
and who would pay the price for this ? we all would			0
we would all pay for the @entity8 's ransom in our daily lives - through higher taxes , fewer jobs , and more and more debt			2
' this is a recipe for mayhem			0
at the very moment our country needs a strong and stable government , we risk a weak and unstable one - pushed to the left by its allies , and open to a daily dose of political blackmail			0
' the former premier pointed to the way that @entity7 leader @entity121 has already suggested that funds raised from the party 's planned ' mansion tax ' in @entity125 could go to @entity2			1
' if a @entity7 leader asks for that , how much more will the @entity8 demand ? ' sir @entity15 is expected to say			1
' and if this is the way @entity7 intends to behave towards @entity125 , how can they say no to the @entity8 ? and if @entity7 did say no , the @entity8 could withdraw support and bring down the government at any time			2
' @entity8 leader @entity132 addressed the @entity133 during a campaign visit to in @entity135 this morning @entity136 poses for a selfie with supporters during a campaign visit to in @entity135 today , after launching the party 's manifesto yesterday with the opinion polls pointing to a hung parliament with the @entity8 holding the balance of power as the third largest party , the threat of a nationalist link - up with @entity7 has emerged as the main @entity70 line of attack in the election campaign			1
the tactic has caused misgivings among some @entity32			0
lord @entity69 - who served as @entity2 secretary in sir @entity15 's government - warned that building up the @entity8 to undermine support for @entity7 in @entity125 could ultimately damage the @entity75			1
' we 've had the dilemma for conservatives , which is they want to be the largest party at @entity160 and therefore some see the fact that the nationalists are going to take seats in @entity2 will be helpful , ' he told the @entity165			0
' but that is a short - term and dangerous view which threatens the integrity of our country			0
' he said mr @entity53 's call for ' @entity173 votes for @entity173 laws ' in the aftermath of last year 's @entity2 independence referendum vote had ' shattered the unionist alliance against the break - up of the @entity24 '			2

' i think we can win this election			0
but clearly , after the general election , you would forge common alliance with parties that you can actually do business with and the @entity8 must be part of that story , ' he told @entity198			2
' i still think @entity7 can form the next government and that 's what i am fighting for			0
but , yes , there is common ground with other parties and the @entity8 would be included in that and we may need to enter into discussion after the @entity192			0
