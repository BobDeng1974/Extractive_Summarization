the so - called ' poster boy ' of @entity8 2014 , the man tasked with giving @entity10 's games the start it deserves , had to settle for silver again in the 200 metres breaststroke			0
that he was beaten so convincingly by his compatriot , 20 - year - old @entity14 , in both the heats and final on thursday , will only add to the pain			1
this was a responsibility @entity6 had taken on his broad shoulder and vowed to carry out himself , waking up at 5.45 each morning to see the world record time of 2mins 7.01secs etched on his alarm clock			2
he had embraced the peculiar pressures of a home games but , ultimately , it proved too much			0

' but i do n't prepare to come second and it is just not good enough			0

@entity62 @entity61 flew off the blocks from lane eight , but @entity14 and @entity6 clawed him back			1
it was the @entity41 in lane four , however , not @entity6 in five , who began to edge clear of the field as the race entered its final two lengths and , despite a late surge , it was @entity14 , wide - eyed with shock , who touched in first			1
