by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 , pictured , said voters were increasingly uneasy about the number of extremists in @entity6 @entity2 has claimed voters are increasingly ‘ uneasy ’ at ‘ extreme elements ’ of @entity6 as a row raged about the wisdom of a new campaign attacking the upstart party as racist			1
the @entity14 , the standard bearer of the @entity16 in the @entity17 , suggested a slew of stories about extreme views of @entity6 members and candidates would undermine the party ’s credibility			1
mr @entity2 ’s intervention came days after health secretary @entity26 also suggested @entity6 has extremist elements			1
a cross-party campaign branding the party racist will launch later this week - despite warnings from some senior @entity31 that it could prove counterproductive			2
@entity32 , @entity33 ’s former immigration minister , who is behind the campaign , said : ‘ @entity6 ’s campaign needs to be exposed for what it is , a racist campaign			1
the party is practising what is in effect a form of ‘ @entity43 ’			0
' they are deploying the same language and tactics used by openly racist parties like the @entity48 , but instead of targeting migrants from @entity50 and @entity51 they are targeting migrants from within the @entity54			1
’ @entity55 , a number 10 policy adviser , co-sponsors the @entity57 , chaired by @entity59 , which is to coordinate the poster and social media campaign			0
but @entity63 , the former labour home secretary , who warned there were no votes to be won by suggesting @entity6 voters are ‘ closet racists ’			2
pointing to @entity69 ’s attack on the @entity71 pensioner @entity70 as ‘ bigoted ’ during the 2010 election campaign , she said : ‘ did we not learn from ‘ bigotgate ’ in 2010 that there are many potential and actual @entity33 voters who feel all the frustrations and insecurities expressed by the @entity6 poster campaign ? telling them they are wrong - and worse , closet racists - is unlikely to win their support			2
’ @entity82 , the senior @entity33 mp credited with killing off the @entity48 in her east @entity85 constituency , said she agreed with @entity86			2
‘ if you are going to rebuild trust in the traditional political parties , you have to really listen and understand the concerns of the public			0
if people feel they ca n’t get a house or ca n’t get their kid into a school , you have to understand that			0
‘ scapegoating immigrants is not the answer but you have got to listen to people ’s frustrations to be able to engage with them			0
labelling them as racists is wrong and counterproductive , ’ she said			0
@entity103 , pictured , who was standing for @entity6 in @entity104 , @entity85 , quit his party membership after he called on comedian @entity106 to emigrate to ' a black country ' mr @entity108 claimed there was an establishment plot by the main parties against @entity6 , urging voters to ‘ give the creeps a lesson ’ at the ballot box			1
his claims that the three main parties were ‘ ganging up ’ on @entity6 , saying : ‘ i think the @entity119 public will take this extremely badly			2
i believe they want and appreciate the new choices being offered to them by @entity6 on issues like immigration control , and will certainly not appreciate being branded racist for doing so ‘ i am really sorry that millions of people who have decided to vote @entity6 next month now find themselves accused by the political establishment of supporting racism			1
’ ‘ the electorate is not in the mood to be intimidated by the political establishment and @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 have just made another disastrous mistake			0
i call on all fair - minded @entity119 people to swing behind @entity6 and teach these creeps a lesson they wo n’t forget in a hurry			2
’ the major parties are rattled by @entity6 's strong performance in opinion polls mr @entity2 said the revelations about @entity6 and its members ‘ would take some time to seep through ’ but said polling showed voters - particularly those who have previously voted @entity146 - were alarmed by @entity6 ’s association with the views of the far - right @entity48			1
addressing young @entity146 activists in remarks leaked to the website @entity155 , mr @entity2 said there was a ‘ whiff of extremism coming through ’ , adding : ‘ i know from polling that voters who have voted conservative feel very uneasy with the association of @entity6 close to what i call some quite extreme elements			1
‘ this kind of stuff worries them but it takes some time to seep through			0
we know genuinely the last thing conservatives want to be associated with is anything that touches on the @entity48			0
‘ they genuinely do n’t like the @entity48 and the suggestions that @entity6 may be in any way close to that is a problem , so just telling them about the government that is rational , reasonable and getting the job done is quite important			1
’ but mr @entity2 warned that in terms of the @entity180 elections next month , which people would use as a ‘ protest vote ’ , @entity6 ’s leader @entity108 could only profit from controversy			1
‘ no matter what publicity he gets , the better it is for him			0
the more he ’s in the public eye the more he gains because he ’s not us			0
he ’s not conservative , he ’s not @entity33 , he ’s not @entity190 , ’ he said .			0

@entity2 claims conservative voters ' *uncomfortable* ' with extreme @entity6 views
conservative party divided over whether @entity6 should be branded ' racist '
