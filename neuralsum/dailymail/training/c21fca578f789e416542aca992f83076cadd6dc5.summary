@entity7 donned a suit and tie and used to cut class from @entity12 's @entity11 in 1955 to go and look for his idol outside her home at the @entity15			2
armed with just an eight millimeter movie camera , luckily for him , in @entity4 's charismatic laid - back way , she invited him to film her one afternoon as she made her way around @entity20			1
caught on film : @entity4 was filmed by @entity7 in 1955 as she walked down @entity20			1
he thought he had lost the footage for almost fifty years ' the whole day she played with me , ' he said in an interview with the today show in 2006			2
' people that have filmed her said no one captured her like the [ 15 - year - old ] kid , because she was n’t threatened , she was n’t afraid			0
it was n’t going to be in the paper so i got the real girl			0
' she noticed and cared - she was absolutely magical ' however , the footage was n't found until some 47 years later after @entity7 was convinced he had thrown it away			1
the filmmaker died last month just weeks before his work would be exhibited			0
it was found in 2002 by @entity7 's brother , @entity42 , who was clearing out their family home			2
the ' real girl ' : 15 - year - old @entity7 waited outside @entity4 's hotel before she invited him to film her for the afternoon			1
his intimate photographs are being exhibited in @entity5 @entity49 : @entity4 entertained her young fan @entity7 as he filmed her for the afternoon on @entity5 's @entity20 ' i was always aware of his fascination with @entity4 and the film , ' his partner of 33 years @entity54 told @entity55			1
' every time we visited @entity5 and walked past the hotel he ’d say ' if i only had n’t thrown that film away			0
’ ' three years later and slightly embarrassed by his movie star crush , @entity7 had intended to bin the film alongside his old movie magazines			2
but somehow the five and a half minutes of footage survived			0
he went on to have a celebrity lifestyle of his own as a roller derby star and well - known hairdresser and was delighted on receiving the call that told him his film was intact			0
special bond : @entity7 , left , then 15 , was invited to film @entity4 for the afternoon			1
the 8mm footage was taken of @entity4 and the designer who later was fitted for the dress she sang happy birthday to @entity72 at @entity73 in , right @entity5 : the owner of the @entity75 exhibiting the photographs said @entity4 felt at home in @entity78 , where the shots were taken ' to me it was gone			1
never to be seen again so it was like wow ! , ' he told the show			0
' within this ordinary context @entity4 has never looked more extraordinary , natural , or beautiful			1
it takes an unusual generosity of spirit to enable an encounter like this and that warmth glows throughout the film , ' a statement from the @entity88 gallery says			0
she and @entity7 were joined on the walk by the fashion designer @entity96 , who would later sew her into a sequined dress she sang @entity71 to @entity72 in , and her friend and business partner @entity99			2
the star was recently divorced from @entity101 and had just moved to the city			0
unnoticed : the star was not troubled on the streets of @entity5 as she walked around in 1955			0
natural beauty : @entity4 was n't made - up for her afternoon captured by 15 - year - old photographer @entity7			1
@entity88 , the @entity106 said : ' @entity4 loved @entity78 , when she died , she was actually a @entity5 resident and she seems very comfortable in @entity78			2
and i think that the way that she is dressed in these pictures , in a very chic kind of black suit with a fur collar makes her look much more like a @entity5 than we normally think of @entity4 as being			2
' the gallery 's promotional material adds : ' so much of our fascination with @entity4 is tied up with her face it comes as something of a surprise to see her hourglass figure and how chic and @entity5 - y she looks in her fur trimmed black cashmere suit			1
' but it is the way that she drifts in and out of interaction with her 15 year old film - maker fan that is most intriguing			0
she blows him a kiss with a smile that could light up the @entity131			0
she looks up at the skyscrapers with a look that is both naïve and perturbed			0
' ' the exhibition will continue as planned – a fitting tribute to @entity136 '			1
divorced : @entity4 had just separated from @entity137 and moved into the @entity15 in @entity78			1
it was here @entity7 began filming her			0
