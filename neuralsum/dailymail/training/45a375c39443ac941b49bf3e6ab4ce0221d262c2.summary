by @entity0 published : 22:37 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 02:39 est , 6 may 2013 an experimental unmanned aircraft developed for the @entity2 went hypersonic during a recent test off the @entity5 coast , flying at more than five times the speed of sound			0
the @entity2 said friday the @entity7 flew for more than three minutes under power from its exotic scramjet engine and hit a speed of @entity11			1
the test on wednesday marked the fourth and final flight of an @entity7 by the @entity2 , which has spent $ 300 million studying scramjet technology that it hopes can be used to deliver strikes around the globe within minutes			1
flight preparation : in this photo released by the @entity2 , the @entity7 , carried under the wing of a @entity22 bomber , prepares to launch for its fourth and final flight over the @entity25 successful launch : the @entity7 successfully launched from a @entity22 , like the one shown here , on may 26 , 2010 @entity7 the previous three flights ended in failure or did n't reach the intended speed			1
though the aircraft was designed to reach @entity33 , or six times the speed of sound , program officials were satisfied with its performance in the latest test			0
‘ it was a full mission success , ’ program manager @entity39 of the @entity40 at @entity41 said in a statement			0
the sleek , missile - shaped @entity7 was released from a b - 52 bomber 50,000 feet above the @entity25 and was initially accelerated by a rocket before the scramjet kicked in			1
faster than sound : the @entity2 said friday the @entity7 flew for more than three minutes under power from its exotic scramjet engine and hit a speed of @entity11 fit testing : the @entity7 hypersonic flight test vehicle was uploaded to an @entity53 at @entity54 , @entity5 , july 17 for fit testing it reached @entity11 4.8 in less than half a minute powered by a solid rocket booster			1
after separating from the booster , the scramjet engine was ignited , accelerating the aircraft to @entity60 at 60,000 feet			1
the flight ended with a planned plunge into the ocean			0
the @entity7 traveled more than 230 miles in six minutes , making it the longest hypersonic flight of its kind			2
engineers gathered data before it splashed down			0
@entity68 , president of @entity69 , which built the @entity7 , called the test ' a historic achievement that has been years in the making			2
' ‘ this test proves the technology has matured to the point that it opens the door to practical applications , ’ @entity68 said in a statement			0
while the @entity2 did not have immediate plans for a successor to the @entity7 , it said it will continue hypersonic flight research			0
rocket accelerated : the sleek , missile - shaped @entity7 was released from a @entity84 feet above the @entity25 and was initially accelerated by a rocket before the scramjet kicked in			2

@entity88 could fly from @entity89 to @entity90 in an hour
@entity7 flew for more than three minutes under power from its exotic scramjet engine and hit a speed of @entity11
