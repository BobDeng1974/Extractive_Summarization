this artist reconstruction shows it had scissor - like claws a lobster - like beast that lived 500 million years ago has been named after @entity12 actor @entity11 because of its ' scissor hand ' claws			1
the extinct creature called @entity2 ( pronounced @entity17 - ten - ee - che - la depp - eye ) was named after @entity11 by scientists from @entity19 who made the discovery			1
@entity2 is helping researchers piece together more information about life on @entity24 during the cambrian period , which happened more than 1.9million years ago and was when nearly all modern animal types emerged			2
lead researcher @entity27 said : ' when i first saw the pair of isolated claws in the fossil records of this species i could not help but think of @entity33			2
' even the genus name , @entity2 , includes the reference to this film as ' chela ' is @entity38 for claws or scissors			1
' i am also a @entity11 fan and what better way to honour the man than to immortalise him as an ancient creature that once roamed the sea ? ' in the 1990 film @entity33 , @entity11 ( right ) starred opposite @entity46 ( left ) and played an artificial man who had scissors for hands			1
his inventor , played in the film by @entity52 , died before giving @entity53 human hands			0
these blades were the inspiration for @entity27 when he was naming the recently discovered fossils of a lobster - like creature that lived 500 million years ago the sea scavenger , @entity2 is a distant relative of lobsters and scorpions			1
it lived in shallow seas off the cost of @entity66 in @entity67			0
it was approximately four centimetres long with a trunk for a body and millipede - like legs			0
it had large eyes which it used to search for food along the sea floor			0
the researchers discovered that @entity2 belongs to a group known as the ' great - appendage ' arthropods , which includes spiders , scorpions , centipedes , millipedes , insects and crabs			1
@entity11 starred as @entity33 in the cult film of the same name in 1990			1
it was directed by @entity89 and was about a man called @entity53 , built by an inventor who died before giving him hands			0
this meant he had blades for fingers			0

fossil specimens of the @entity2 - a lobster - like creature that lived 500 million years ago			1
it was discovered by @entity27 from @entity19			0
@entity27 named the fossils after @entity12 actor @entity11 partly because of its scissor - like claws , and partly because @entity27 is a @entity11 fan the @entity2 is an ancestor of modern - day lobsters , pictured the researchers discovered that @entity2 belongs to a group known as the ' great - appendage ' arthropods , which includes spiders , scorpions , centipedes , millipedes , insects and crabs			1
mr @entity27 said : ' just imagine it - the prawns covered in mayonnaise in your sandwich , the spider climbing up your wall and even the fly that has been banging into your window and annoyingly flying into your face are all descendants of @entity2			2
' ' current estimates indicate that there are more than one million known insects and potentially 10 million more yet to be categorised , which potentially means that @entity2 has a huge family tree			2
' @entity27 now wants to study the fossils from the @entity148 period , when species diversity increased			0
the research was published in the @entity112 2 may 2013 .			0

fossils of lobster creature show it had scissor - like claws similar to @entity11 *'s* character in 1990 film @entity33
