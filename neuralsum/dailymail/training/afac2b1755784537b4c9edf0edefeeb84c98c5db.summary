by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity3 reporter published : 08:59 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 10:48 est , 30 august 2013 president @entity4 is planning for the possibility of launching a unilateral @entity7 military action against @entity8 within days after @entity9 opted out in a stunning vote by @entity11			1
facing skepticism at home , administration officials spoke with a group of lawmakers for more than 90 minutes thursday evening to explain why they believe @entity18 's government was the culprit in a suspected chemical attack last week			1
afterward , the @entity21 , rep. @entity22 of @entity23 , pointedly sided with @entity24 speaker @entity24 of @entity25 in urging the administration to do more to engage with @entity27 on the matter			1
she said the administration needs to consult more with ' all members of @entity27 ' – a reference to the limited circle briefed thursday night – and provide ' additional transparency into the decision - making process			1
' the president of the @entity7 is elected with the duty to protect the national security interests in the @entity7 , ' @entity47 spokesman @entity46 said			1
half of @entity7 say they oppose taking military action against @entity8 and nearly 80 percent believe @entity4 should seek congressional approval before using any force , according to a new @entity56 poll			1
after the vote in @entity11 thursday , @entity9 ’s ‘ special relationship ’ with the @entity7 is under threat , @entity38 has been warned			1
urgent calls were made to the @entity47 last night soon after the government defeat amid claims by one @entity64 official that @entity9 had ‘ handed back its deputy sheriff badge			1
' chancellor @entity66 warned @entity9 must undertake ‘ national soul - searching ’ about its place in the world as defence secretary @entity67 warned the special relationship was now under ‘ strain ’			1
diplomatic experts also voiced deep concerns that the repercussions for @entity9 ’s standing on the world stage would be long - lasting			2
the @entity77 said last night 's commons vote has damaged @entity9 's reputation as a major global power and also sent a worrying message to dictators , while the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) said it was an embarrassment			1
former @entity85 leader @entity85 said the defeat in the @entity87 had left the @entity9 a ‘ hugely diminished country ’			0
the influential @entity90 grassroots website @entity91 said mr @entity38 had suffered ' the worst foreign policy defeat in modern times '			0
mr @entity38 had promised mr @entity4 he would stand should to shoulder with the @entity7 in taking military action against the @entity18 regime after the devastating chemical weapons attack in @entity97 last week			1
to add further embarrassment , @entity99 president @entity98 said his country was prepared to stand alongside @entity7 and ' punish ' @entity8 leader @entity18			1
he said : ‘ the chemical massacre at @entity97 can not and must not remain unpunished			0
otherwise , we take the risk of an escalation that would normalise the use of these weapons , and threaten other countries			0
' each country is free to choose whether to take part in such an operation or not			0
that holds true for @entity9 and @entity99			2
' prime minister @entity38 recalled @entity11 to stage an emergency vote to endorse @entity9 involvement in missile strikes			0
but @entity116 voted by 272 votes to 285 to reject mr @entity38 ’s motion backing @entity9 intervention in principle			0
it is the first time that @entity11 has voted against the government on a matter of war and peace since 1782 , and raises the prospect of the @entity7 having to go it alone			2
mr @entity67 said : ‘ it ’s certainly going to place some strain on the special relationship			0
’ he said the @entity7 ‘ have been surprised by the scale of opposition in @entity11 , and perhaps they will struggle a bit to understand the very special reasons that there are for that view in @entity11 ’			0
debate : a chastened mr @entity38 was forced by @entity139 leader @entity138 to pledge not to deploy any @entity9 military forces without first staging another @entity87 vote @entity143 sources stressed that there had been ‘ understanding ’ from the @entity47 about the outcome of the vote			1
but there was acknowledgement that it permanently altered the assumption that @entity9 and the @entity7 would act together in military operations around the world			1
chancellor mr @entity66 insisted the relationship with the @entity7 is a ‘ very old one , very deep and operates on many layers ’ and there had been ' a bit of hyperbole ' about the impact of the vote			0
but he suggested the @entity9 was now at a crucial crossroads in deciding the role it plays in global politics			0
‘ i think there will be a national soul - searching about our role in the world and whether @entity9 wants to play a big part in upholding the international system , be that big open and trading nation that i 'd like us to be or whether we turn our back on that , ’ he told @entity169 ’s today programme			2
‘ i understand the deep scepticism that my colleagues in @entity11 many members of the public have about @entity9 involvement in @entity8			2
‘ i hope this does n’t become the moment where we turn our back on the world ’s problems			0
’ @entity189 : @entity7 defense secretary @entity190 told reporters during a visit to the @entity193 that @entity7 would still consult @entity9 alarm : defence secretary @entity67 ( left ) said the @entity87 vote put the special relationship under ' strain ' while chancellor @entity66 warned @entity9 against turning its back on the world @entity47 officials cautiously suggested mr @entity4 was prepared to launch strikes against @entity8 without @entity9 support			1
but asked if the @entity7 would go it alone , @entity47 spokesman @entity46 said : ‘ the opinion of others in this situation matters			2
’ @entity7 defence secretary @entity190 said @entity7 still wanted to secure international backing for any military intervention			1
speaking during a trip to the @entity193 , he said : ' it is the goal of president @entity4 and our government ... whatever decision is taken , that it be an international collaboration and effort			2
' our approach is to continue to find an international coalition that will act together			0
and i think you 're seeing a number of countries state , publicly state , their position on the use of chemical weapons			0
' but @entity226 , a @entity227 analyst for the @entity229 - based @entity228 , told @entity230 that the vote ‘ complicates life and this has bigger implications about the nature of the relationship between the @entity7 and its closest ally ’			2
dr @entity238 , executive director of the trans - @entity239 think tank the @entity77 , said : ‘ if not reversed , this vote means the @entity9 will join the rank of third - rate nations , condemned to be the prisoner of events and with no power to shape them			2
‘ this is a shameful result which will not be readily forgotten by our allies			0
we can be certain that more atrocities will follow in @entity8			0
’ @entity83 director general professor @entity252 said the decision not to go ahead with military intervention would prove an embarrassment for @entity9 on the international stage			1
@entity85 , who appeared in front of @entity258 with leader @entity259 yesterday in an attempt to persuade rebels to back the government , wrote on @entity263 : ‘ in 50 years trying to serve my country i have never felt so depressed / ashamed			0
@entity9 's answer to the @entity8 horrors ? none of our business ! ’ labour leader @entity138 insisted that the @entity9 - @entity7 relationship ' remains strong ' despite last night 's vote			1
he said : ' i do think there 's a lesson for @entity9 , though , which is that we must lead in the right way for @entity9 from our national interest and indeed our global interest			0
' now sometimes that will mean agreeing with what @entity7 is doing and the way it 's going about things , and sometimes it will mean doing things in a different way			0

half of @entity7 say they oppose taking military action against @entity8 and nearly 80 percent believe @entity4 should seek congressional approval before using any force , according to a new @entity56 poll
