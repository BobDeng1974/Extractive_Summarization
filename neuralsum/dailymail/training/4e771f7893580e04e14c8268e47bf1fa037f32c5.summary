’ and holding up the ultimate male style role model as an example , the guide adds : ‘ button - downs can also be worn with a blazer – like @entity36 did as @entity37			1
’ it is also permitted to wear the style with a sports coat ‘ and with brogues if wearing chinos or even desert boots with a soft - shouldered suit and silk knitted tie ’			2
