by @entity0 published : 20:05 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 04:59 est , 31 october 2013 the battle over national health care is costing president @entity3 in the polls as he now has his lowest approval rating of his presidency			1
a new poll put out by @entity8 and the @entity9 reveals that only 42 per cent of the country approves of the president 's job performance			2
that approval rating is five points lower than it was earlier this month in the heat of the government shutdown following the budget battle			1
showing that the federal problems are overflowing into uncharted territory , the new poll reveals that the president 's personal approval ratings have flipped from their normal stance - where more americans like him as a person than those who dislike him			1
now 41 per cent of respondents view him favorably and 45 per cent see him in a negative light			0
feeling the heat : president @entity3 's approval rating dropped to its lowest - ever point of 22 per cent while 51 per cent of @entity24 disapprove of his job performance ( which is tied for his highest score ever ) still got some fans : president @entity3 signs @entity37 's cast at an event in @entity39 on wednesday signing off : the president signed the cast as he gave his latest speech in support of the @entity43 ' personally and politically , the public â€™s assessment is two thumbs down , ' pollster @entity44 told @entity8			1
president @entity3 : 22 per cent approves of his job performance , 51 per cent disapproves - 41 per cent view him favorably and 45 per cent sees him in a negative light @entity49 : 74 per cent think @entity49 is causing more problems than they are solving republicans : 22 per cent approve of their job performance and 53 per cent disapprove the shutdown : 38 per cent blame @entity54 , 23 per cent blame @entity57 , and 36 per cent feel that both parties are equally responsible the negative responses were not limited to the president , however , as the @entity54 in general was met with an all - time - low of 22 per cent approval and 53 per cent disapproval			1
nearly three - quarters of the respondents said that @entity49 was causing more problems than solving them			0
just slightly more than one - fifth ( 22 per cent ) of the country thinks we 're headed in the right direction and half of all respondents think that another government shutdown is inevitable			2
and finally , 63 per cent of respondents want to vote their congressional representative out of office			0
that particular question has been regularly asked in polls over the past decade an the latest response is the highest ever			0
president @entity3 's disapproval rating - which measures the portion of the country who actively believes that the president is doing a poor job - came in at 51 per cent			2
both in the hot seat : president @entity3 and the @entity57 are not the only ones in trouble as the @entity54 , headed by @entity85 , also reached their lowest approval rating ' unpopular ' : the poll reveals that @entity93 speaker @entity85 ( left ) , senate majority leader @entity90 ( center ) and senate minority leader @entity92 ( right ) are all viewed in a negative light this is the second time that his unfavorables have reached that high since he took office in 2009			1
talk of fallout from the 16 - day government shutdown earlier this month was a constant concern during the negotiations , and it seems that the fact that @entity57 came out just slightly less - hated than @entity54 has begun to fade			0
more @entity24 - 38 per cent - blame @entity54 for the shutdown as opposed to @entity57 - who are seen as the cause by 23 per cent of respondents - but there is still a sizable group - 36 per cent - who think both were to blame			0
pollsters explained that there was no one single problem cited by respondents , but rather it is a result of numerous issues			0
in addition to the ongoing health insurance roll out and postponed budget battles , longer - lasting controversies like the @entity124 spying and the handling of the chemical weapons attack in @entity127			1
looming : half of respondents said that they felt there would be another government shutdown			0

president @entity3 now has the lowest professional and personal approval ratings of his presidency
@entity54 are also at their lowest point with only 22 per cent approval rating and 53 per cent of @entity24 disapproving of their job performance
comes after health care roll out , government shutdown , the budget battle , @entity124 spying controversy and @entity127 chemical weapons attack
