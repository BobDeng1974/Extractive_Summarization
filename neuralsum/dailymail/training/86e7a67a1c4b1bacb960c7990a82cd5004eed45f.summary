we have all experienced that disappointing moment a supermarket fails to stock our favourite food			0
but few will have expressed their frustration in such a novel way as two students from @entity8			2
when classics student @entity10 and @entity11 , a maths and physics student , found no @entity9 salted caramel popcorn in the town 's @entity16 branch they decided to write a sonnet to the supermarket giant			1
the @entity21 students first wrote to @entity16 and the supermarket giant replied with a poem of their own they elected to put pen to paper after their film night was ruined by the lack of popcorn			1
mr @entity11 said : ' it was n't quite the same watching the movie without the popcorn , so instead of watching the movie we sent this poem to sir @entity35			1
' the hardest , and most time - consuming part was to get the printer to print on the ivory parchment paper we were using			0
' the sonnet included lines such as : ' when i went to the shelf popcorn sits on			2
' and just found the lump in my throat you get / when something you love is there , then it 's gone			0
' ' i live in @entity21 , thus the issue : " no plans to restock , " you said with a sigh			0
' so answer this , or hand me a tissue : have i butterkist my true love goodbye ? ' the letter was written to sir @entity57 , who resigned as chairman of @entity16 last month following reports of accounting errors and falling sales due to competition from budget stores @entity64 and @entity65			2
despite sir @entity35 's departure , the students still received a reply from the @entity69 of the supermarket - also written as a poem			1
the students wrote a sonnet after finding no @entity9 salted caramel popcorn in the town 's @entity16 ( pictured ) the quick - witted reply from @entity16 - which incorrectly referred to mr @entity11 as a ' lady ' - urges the pair to ' please dry your tears ' as ' we 'll still sell your popcorn for many more years '			1
it continues : ' your favourite popcorn is waiting for you / across the @entity85 , no really it 's true ! ' our product is stocked in both @entity88 and @entity89 / and i 've found a way you can have it for free			0
' the reply ends by assuring the two students they will be sent a £ 10 giftcard for their troubles			1
the pair uploaded the poems to the ' overheard at @entity21 ' facebook page and it has attracted almost 3,000 ' likes ' in three days .			0
