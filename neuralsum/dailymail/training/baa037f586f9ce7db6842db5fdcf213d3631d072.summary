by @entity0 published : 14:16 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 05:36 est , 29 march 2013 pregnancy is taken more seriously if expectant mothers in @entity3 are carrying boys rather than girls , according to a study			1
a survey of more than 30,000 @entity3 by @entity8 and @entity9 has revealed that preferential treatment for men starts before they are even born			2
women expecting boys were more likely to get prenatal medical appointments , take iron supplements , and receive vital tetanus shots			1
discrimination : expectant mothers carrying girls are less likely to give birth in hospital , take iron supplements and receive tetanus immunisation they were also more likely to deliver a son in a health - care facility , as opposed to at home			1
it is even still common practice to have an abortion based on the baby 's sex in @entity3 , though it is illegal			1
when baby girls are carried to full term , they still face medical discrimination with serious long - term health consequences			0
assistant professor @entity37 from @entity8 who carried out the research said : ' this type of discrimination , while not as severe as sex - selective abortion , is very important for children 's well - being ' ' it paints a pretty dire picture of what 's happening			2
' missing out on the @entity46 is a particular worry as it is the main cause of newborn deaths in @entity3			0
babies whose mothers had not received a tetanus vaccination were more likely to be born underweight or die shortly after birth			0
head start : boys get preferential treatment before they are even born in many male - dominated societies the researchers compared the survey to other patriarchal nations such as @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 and saw similar evidence of medical discrimination			1
this could mean that girls are already at a serious disadvantage when they are born			0
' we know that children born at higher birth weights go to school for longer periods and have higher wages as adults , so the future implications here are serious , ' @entity37 said			0
