@entity0 is the most decisive referee in the select group when it comes to straight red cards but sometimes he sees ones which just are not there			1
when @entity7 went into a strong challenge with @entity9 it was hard to see who had made the foul			1
both players were fully committed and the @entity15 player 's momentum meant he caught the @entity17 man with his right leg as he followed through			2
@entity0 would not have been influenced by the @entity17 players who surrounded him , he had already decided and gone for his top pocket where he keeps his red card			1
i hope the card is rescinded on appeal			0
@entity15 striker @entity7 was sent off for this tackle on @entity17 's @entity9 there was an interesting incident at @entity28 from which @entity29 got their first goal			1
the home side were rightly awarded a free - kick for handball which @entity34 took immediately			2
his pass went towards @entity37 , who was clearly in an offside position , but he ignored the ball			0
@entity40 ran on to it and crossed for @entity34 to score			0
the assistant did very well to hold his flag and was absolutely correct to do so			0
however , replays highlighted that the ball was moving when @entity34 took the free - kick			1
@entity47 should have seen from this from his position and ordered the free - kick to be retaken			0
@entity34 nods in @entity29 's opener against @entity51 but there was controversy in the build - up another excellent offside decision came from @entity56 at @entity57 when @entity58 looked well offside before his overhead kick went just wide			1
replays showed how good a decision this was but his form was certainly not matched by @entity64 at the other end			0
trailing 2 - 0 , @entity66 should have got back into the game when @entity68 headed home a @entity71 cross			2
however , @entity64 flagged for offside when @entity73 , who was right in front of him , had clearly played @entity68 onside			1
@entity66 midfielder @entity68 ( right ) had this header against @entity57 wrongly ruled out there was some lovely justice seen at @entity79 's when @entity80 missed @entity81 clearly kick @entity82 when he was in the air			2
@entity80 must have thought that @entity81 had kicked the ball so wrongly awarded a corner from which @entity86 got their opening goal			0
@entity86 did n't get a penalty for this kick on @entity82 by @entity81 but scored from the corner @entity91 was right to award @entity92 a penalty when @entity94 pulled back @entity95 at a corner , but the home side should have had another when @entity98 was sent sprawling in the area when caught by @entity94 's trailing leg .			0

@entity15 's @entity7 was shown a red card by @entity0
but the striker 's challenge on @entity9 was not *dangerous*
@entity29 's @entity34 played a moving ball in the build - up to his goal
*linesman* @entity64 was wrong to flag @entity68 offside
