published : 16:17 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 04:49 est , 29 september 2012 broken arm : @entity0 's mother @entity2 has been hit twice by cyclists on august 16 , my mother was hit by a @entity7 lout			1
she was crossing the road when a youth on a bicycle shot a red light , knocked her to the ground and left her with a broken arm			1
yesterday , a friend telephoned to ask about her health			1
' she would be feeling better , ' i replied , ' if she had n't been hit by another bicycle the other evening			1
' i could hear a convulsion in his voice			1
it sounded like stifled laughter			2
he could not repress a gurgling sound before he managed to compose himself to express sympathy and shock			2
' again ? how awful ! ' but it is n't amusing			2
she was shopping in @entity28 's @entity27 when she was hit by the first cyclist , who failed to stop			2
he did n't even look back			2
kindly passers - by dragged her seemingly inert body on to the pavement and called an ambulance			2
the hospital said she was lucky to have survived			2
as it is , the bones in her right arm are so badly broken they will never heal properly			2
then three days ago , just as she was regaining some strength , she crossed a street near her home in @entity28 to buy bread			2
once again , a hit - and - run cyclist struck			2
this time my mother nearly lost the sight in her left eye			1
and her broken arm sustained such serious damage that she may have to undergo a lengthy operation			2
look out : ' male cyclophiles are becoming a blot on our highways ' if my mother had been hit twice by a car in a similar space of time , the general reaction would have been one of horror and outrage			1
the anti-car lobby has portrayed motorists as evil , greedy killers of the innocent and destroyers of the planet			0
cyclists , on the other hand , are heroes , particularly in the wake of our @entity71 triumphs			1
consider dashing @entity72 and glowing @entity73			0
and to many of us , there is something charming about bicycles			0
they conjure up images of @entity81 in tweed knickerbockers , and our own irrepressible and endearing mayor of @entity28 , @entity84			0
but this halcyon haze enveloping cyclists hides a disturbing truth			1
concerned daughter : @entity0 wants a change in the law the majority are safe – but not all			1
there are rogues : @entity7 louts whose intentions are as low as the meanest hit - men			0
in 2008 , i had my handbag stolen by a gang of youths on bikes			0
this is not to deny the guilt of many motorists who drive irresponsibly , and the fact that every year innocent cyclists lose their lives as a result			1
but the police have established , in conjunction with the @entity111 , that half of all collisions between bicycles and cars are the fault of the cyclist			0
i have seen cyclists on the pavement and on the wrong side of the road			1
others fail to signal , overtake on the inside and ignore traffic lights			0
they either do n't have lights or fail to use them			0
they ride in the gutters and weave in and out between cars			0
some ride when fatigued or drunk , and many have failed to learn how to control their bicycles			0
there are training courses for cyclists but only one in 100 enrols			1
this is in sharp contrast to the position of the motorist , who , since 1935 , has had to be over 17 and capable of passing a stringent test in 1934 , 7,343 people were killed on the roads despite there being only 2.4 million vehicles in circulation			1
today there are more than 30 million vehicles in the @entity146 , yet the number of fatalities in 2011 was 1,901			0
aside from the dangers , male cyclophiles are becoming a blot on our highways			0
they are weirdly obsessive about their mode of transport and fuss endlessly about their appearance			0
@entity161 over handlebars in their garish @entity7 armour and insect - shaped - helmets , cyclists see themselves as @entity162 – but look more like @entity163 with a chamber pot on his head			1
people undergo a strange transformation when they take up cycling			0
four years ago i bought a @entity171 bike			0
to paraphrase @entity172 , ' let a cycle in your life , and you invite eternal strife			0
' as i wobbled along @entity28 's roads , nearly hitting every pedestrian and car in sight , i was petrified and hysterical , screaming every shrewish curse i knew reckless : ' a law that will force cyclists to take a proper test is long overdue ' after three days , disgusted with myself and unwilling to commit manslaughter , i rode on to the kerb – deliberately – and fell down			1
i then hailed a taxi and put my bike inside			0
i have never cycled since			0
urban @entity191 is not suited to bicycles			0
there are no wide boulevards to separate cars and cyclists as in @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200			1
a law that will force cyclists to take a proper test and abide by the @entity203 is long overdue			1
my mother might have died last week			1
many others unlucky enough to become involved with reckless cyclists do			1
i am sure that @entity72 and @entity207 would concur : it 's time we put a spoke in their wheels .			0

' a law that will force cyclists to take a proper test and abide by the @entity203 is long overdue '
