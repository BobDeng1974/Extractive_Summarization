by @entity0 published : 17:50 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 02:11 est , 19 july 2012 he is portrayed as a brutish ape - man , prowling around for prey to spear for dinner			0
but scientists now believe neanderthal man was actually more of the stay - at - home type			0
researchers at @entity9 have found evidence our early ancestors may have spent most of their time carrying out tedious domestic chores			1
their remains show they had very big right arms - some 50 per cent stronger than their left arms - which has previously been put down to hunting big game with spears			1
@entity22 hunter or domestic @entity23 ? researchers at @entity9 have found evidence our early ancestors may have spent most of their time carrying out tedious domestic chores hunters - or home - makers ? ¿ for much of the time @entity28 might have been performing other tasks , such as preparing skins , which changes our picture of their daily activities			1
¿ however a new analysis suggests hunting would not have had this effect , and their bone structure is more likely to be the result of hours spent scraping animals hides to make clothes			1
it was the @entity41 when the @entity28 roamed @entity42 and they would have need to wear furs to survive			1
dr @entity45 , an archaeologist , said : ‘ the skeletal remains suggest that @entity28 were doing something intense or repetitive , or both , that had a significant role in their lives			1
the question is what was it ? ‘ the main theory until now is that it was hunting of mammoths and deer , which has coloured our view of the @entity28 as a hunter			1
but we have shown it would not have had the effect we have seen on the bones			0
‘ for much of the time @entity28 might have been performing other tasks , such as preparing skins , which changes our picture of their daily activities			1
’ the researchers say the shape of the humerus bones which have survived – the long bone which runs from the shoulder to elbow – show the @entity28 right upper arms were unusually strong			1
most right - handed people have arms which are 10 per cent stronger than the left			0
the disparity in @entity28 arms is only seen in people such as tennis players			1
an international team of researchers led by the @entity82 and the @entity83 , has found the first molecular evidence that @entity28 not only ate a range of cooked plant foods , but also understood its nutritional and medicinal qualities			2
until recently @entity28 , who disappeared between 30,000 and 24,000 years ago , were thought to be predominantly meat - eaters			2
however , researchers from @entity91 , the @entity92 and @entity93 combined pyrolysis gas - chromatography - mass spectrometry with an analysis of plant microfossils to identify material trapped in calcified dental plaque from five @entity28 from the north @entity91 site of @entity100			2
dr @entity45 ’s team used right - handed volunteers to carry out spear throwing and scraping tasks , while the muscle activity in their chest and shoulder – which influences the movement of this upper arm bone - was measured using electrodes			0
he said : ‘ we found that not only was it unlikely that the @entity28 were throwing spears as regularly as a tennis player hits the ball , but it was not having this effect on their right arm			2
‘ although it was thought the right arm would have been holding the back of the spear and doing the thrusting			0
it was making their left arm , which was closer to the target , slightly stronger			0
‘ however during the scraping task we saw activity consistent with their arm shape , so that is a plausible explanation			0
’ one of the tools most often found with @entity28 remains in @entity42 is a ‘ side scraper ’ used to scrape soft tissue from the underside of animal hides , which needed to be removed so it did not rot			2
the researchers said @entity28 would have needed around six skins to make one outfit and needed to make one for each member of their family every year			2
it was a laborious task , as studies of @entity146 and @entity148 hunters shows even experienced people would take about eight hours to scrape a single hide			0
dr @entity45 , from the @entity152 research groups and @entity153 , said : ‘ preparing several hides for each member of the community would have require exactly the sort of repetitious activity attested to by the overdeveloped arms of @entity28 skeletons			1
’ it paints a new picture of our caveman ancestors who , if they spent a lot more time at home , could have got involved in cooking , child care , butchering and tool making			1
neanderthals , who roamed @entity42 and the @entity172 for around 100,000 years , are generally thought of as uncivilised creatures who were out - witted and out - hunted by modern humans around 35,000 years ago			0
but recent studies have increasingly suggested that they were actually far more sophisticated than previously thought , living in communities , eating cooked food , making complex tools and even interbreeding with humans			0
the study is published in science journal @entity183			0

@entity28 big right arms were actually from doing chores
our ancestors spent much of their time skinning prey
' domestic ' *hominids* spent time at home preparing animals
