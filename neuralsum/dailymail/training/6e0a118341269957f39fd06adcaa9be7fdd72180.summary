a 71 - year - old terminally ill @entity1 man has died in what has been described as a ' clear cut case of suicide ' after appealing for euthanasia drugs over social media			1
@entity7 had been suffering from rectal cancer , which soon spread through the rest of his body , for three years before he took to @entity11 to describe his agony			1
while @entity14 police are investigating the death , according to the @entity18 , @entity17 founder dr @entity16 who helped mr @entity7 upload his plea for help on @entity11 , told @entity21 that it was clear his internet call - out was anonymously answered			1
71 - year - old rectal cancer sufferer @entity7 was found dead in his @entity1 home on thursday left with a permanent colostomy bag , constant muscle tension and nausea , mr @entity7 described his pain as ' severe ' and feeling like he ' had been kicked in the same spot for six weeks '			1
' not being able to exert myself in any way has led to boredom and a feeling of uselessness , ' he said in a video uploaded to @entity11 on august 21			2
@entity17 founder dr @entity16 described his death as a ' clear cut case of suicide ' ' waking up in the morning , even now , means the start of another day of pain , despair , nausea , loneliness , uselessness and sitting on the veranda wishing i was dead			1
sadness is a constant companion , self - esteem is non-existent			0
' in a second video , uploaded on august 30 , the former federal candidate for euthanasia read out his phone number and address while pleading with viewers to send him a euthanasia drug			1
' i have approached @entity59 [ an assisted dying organisation ] in @entity61 and while i was medically accepted , the required paperwork was unavailable			0
and frankly i 'd rather die here in @entity1 in my own home than in a lingering death in palliative care			0
' ' if there is anybody out there who could provide , supply or sell me enough of the euthanasia drug … , so i could have this choice , i would be very grateful			0
' mr @entity7 was found dead in his home on thursday by a friend who also found a note , according to dr @entity16			1
' it was a short note that thanked the @entity17 organisation and @entity11 and mentioned that he had the support he wanted at the end , ' dr @entity16 said			1
' he also made a point in the note about the suffering he was going through and that he could n't continue any longer – how taking his own life was a sensible option			0
' dr @entity16 also mentioned that the cancer sufferer had been in happy spirits a week before his death ' because he had been successful with his appeal on the internet			2
' ' what that did to him is he felt that he had some option , and he was pleased to know he had this choice			0
before that he felt he would only grow worse and worse and more vulnerable before being forced out of his own environment and into a hospice , ' dr @entity16 said			0
in a video uploaded to @entity11 on august 30 mr @entity7 , a former federal candidate for euthanasia , read out his phone number and address while pleading with viewers to send him a euthanasia drug although mr @entity7 did not share his plan of suicide with him in his final days , dr @entity16 described his death as a ' clear cut case of suicide ' and compared it to the death of @entity109 man @entity107			1
at 84 years of age and suffering from an inoperable melanoma , mr @entity111 's @entity11 plea for euthanasia drugs was successfully answered by someone from @entity116 who mailed the drugs to his home			0
he died ' peacefully ' in april this year , according to dr @entity16			2
the @entity17 founder said there have been at least four other such cases that he knows of across @entity122 , involving people who were far too sick to seek other methods of finding the drugs			0
however while suicide is not a crime anywhere in @entity122 , dr @entity16 warns that anyone who helps a person with the act , ' even if they are doing it out of compassion and love ' will find themselves in a ' legal nightmare '			2
dr @entity16 said there has been at least four other cases of terminally ill @entity138 , who were hopeful of choosing when they end their life , successfully seeking euthanasia drugs over social media at 84 , after suffering from an inoperable melanoma , @entity145 's plea for euthanasia drugs was successfully answered by someone from @entity116 who mailed the drugs to his home before his death in april despite a short period of time in 1995 when euthanasia was legal in the @entity14 , assisting someone with the act will now land someone a sentence of life imprisonment			2
the same goes for anyone helping someone commit suicide in @entity159 and @entity122 while @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 have a maximum penalty of 12 years in jail			0
@entity166 's maximum sentence for the crime is only five years			0
dr @entity16 said that both he and mr @entity7 were campaigning to change these laws and the @entity17 organisation has been increasingly , both in @entity122 and overseas , ' making sure that people have access to drugs themselves ' so that their loved ones can avoid trouble with the law .			1
