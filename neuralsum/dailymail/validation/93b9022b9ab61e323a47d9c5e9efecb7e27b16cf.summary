a jury awarded @entity2 's children $ 7.4million on tuesday after determining singers @entity3 and @entity5 copied their father 's music to create @entity8 , the biggest hit song of 2013			1
@entity2 's daughter @entity10 wept as the verdict was being read and was hugged by her attorney , @entity12			1
the verdict could tarnish the legacy of @entity5 , a reliable hit - maker who has won @entity15 and appears on @entity17 's music competition show @entity18			2
it was previously revealed that the song had made a staggering $ 16million for @entity5 , @entity3 , rapper @entity21 and the record company , though @entity21 and various record and music companies had previously been cleared of copyright infringement charges			1
the jury decided that the family should receive $ 4million in damages and $ 3.4 million in profits from the song , with @entity3 forced to pay $ 1.7million from his own pocket and @entity5 $ 1.6million			1
all three later released a statement , saying ; ' while we respect the judicial process , we are extremely disappointed in the ruling made today , which sets a horrible precedent for music and creativity going forward			2
' @entity8 ’ was created from the heart and minds of @entity5 , @entity3 and @entity21 and not taken from anyone or anywhere else			1
we are reviewing the decision , considering our options and you will hear more from us soon about this matter			0
' ' right now , i feel free , ' an emotional @entity10 said after the verdict			1
' free from ... @entity5 and @entity3 's chains and what they tried to keep on us and the lies that were told			1
' this was no doubt in response to the fact that @entity5 and @entity3 had filed a lawsuit against @entity10 's estate back in august 2013 in an attempt to stop his family from suing them for copyright infringement			1
' plaintiffs , who have the utmost respect for and admiration of @entity2 , @entity86 and their musical legacies , reluctantly file this action in the face of multiple adverse claims from alleged successors in interest to those artists			0
defendants continue to insist that plaintiffs ' massively successful composition , ' @entity8 , ' copies ' their ' compositions , ' read the suit			2
this suit however was thrown out in october of that year , when a judge ruled that the family had made a sufficient showing that the two songs were similar			0
' we did not start this fight … @entity5 and @entity3 started this lawsuit , ” @entity12 said outside of the courthouse			2
' we fought this fight with one arm tied behind our back			0
' @entity10 , best known for such classics as @entity113 , @entity111 ( to be loved by you ) , was tragically murdered by his father when he was just 44 - years - old @entity10 ( second from left ) , daughter of late singer @entity2 , and her lawyer @entity12 ( front right ) speak to the media following the verdict the @entity123 ' lawyer branded @entity5 and @entity3 liars who went beyond trying to emulate the sound of @entity10 's late - 1970s music and copied the @entity129 legend 's hit got to give it up outright			1
he also brought up the fact after the verdict that the defense 's legal team did everything they could to stop the jury from hearing @entity10 's song during the proceedings , allowing them to just listen to certain snippets of the music			1
for this reason the infringement charge only applied to the sheet music for the two songs , making the case against @entity3 and @entity5 that much more difficult for the @entity10 family			1
@entity12 however pointed out during his argument that @entity3 said in interviews while promoting the single that he and @entity5 were trying to write something like @entity10 's @entity152			1
@entity3 told jurors he did n't write @entity8 , which @entity5 testified he crafted in about an hour in mid- 2012 , as he was too high on painkillers and alcohol			1
' the biggest hit of my career was written by somebody else , and i was jealous and wanted credit , ' said @entity3			0
he also took time on the stand to play a variety of songs that sound similar in music and tone in an attempt to strengthen his case @entity5 told jurors that @entity10 's music was part of the soundtrack of his youth , but the seven - time @entity15 winner said he did n't use any of it to create @entity8 and that the songs were alike in genre only			1
the pair 's lawyer maintained their innocence even after the verdict , saying ; ' they 're unwavering in their absolute conviction that they wrote this song independently			2
' @entity12 , far left , walks with the late singer , @entity2 's family members , from left , daughter , @entity10 , ex-wife , @entity189 , and son , @entity190 according to the @entity192 , he song brought in $ 5.6 million for @entity3 , $ 5.2 million for @entity5 and another $ 5 million to $ 6 million for the record company , as well as an additional $ 8 million in publishing revenue @entity10 's children - @entity10 , @entity190 and @entity196 - sued the singers in 2013 and were present when the verdict was read			1
the family had initially asked for $ 40million in damages , but later lowered that number to $ 25million			0
this was based on the amount of money they believed @entity10 would have been paid had he signed off on the rights to his song			2
@entity10 's ex-wife @entity209 testified that as soon as she heard the song she recognized the similarities and was thrilled thinking that this would introduce the music of her late husband to a new generation of music lovers			1
that quickly turned to anger however when she learned the rights to @entity10 's song had not been licensed			1
sales of the 2013 song , which has already sold 7.3million copies in the @entity223 alone , are still going strong too , and have seen a drastic increase over the course of the trial this past few weeks			0
@entity10 , best known for such classics as @entity113 , @entity111 ( to be loved by you ) , was tragically murdered by his father as he tried to break up a fight between his parents and protect his mother in 1984			2
the singer , just 44 - years - old at the time , had been nominated for 14 @entity15 at that point over the course of his brilliant but all too brief career , and left the rights to all his music to his three children			0
an appeal of the ruling is already being considered by @entity5 and @entity3 's lawyer			2
@entity244 vs. @entity244 : @entity244 's monster hit @entity246 , a song which earned him three @entity15 at this year 's ceremony while also contributing to his @entity251 victory , sounded a little to similar to the @entity252 , something the latter 's lawyers picked up on and took to court			0
the two settled the entire thing like gentlemen however , coming to an agreement out of court that gives @entity244 and composer @entity261 a writing credit on the track and 12.5 % of the royalties			0
the @entity265 : the @entity266 became one of the biggest bands of 1999 thanks to their hit @entity270 , a song which sampled strings from the @entity274 's @entity273			0
the band however was told they could only use a five - note sample , and once they song was released were accused of breaking their promise and using more			0
as a result , @entity281 and @entity282 were given writing credits for the track alongside @entity266 's @entity286 , and the group had to relinquish all royalties they received for the song			0
@entity290 and @entity291 : while @entity291 remains a one - hit wonder , that hit , @entity293 , still receives massive play over 20 years after it was released by the rapper			0
the song clearly borrowed however from the @entity291 and @entity290 tune @entity299 , something the rapper initially denied			0
the case was eventually settled out of court , and the details of the settlement were never revealed , though it is known that @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 and @entity291 all now have songwriting credits			0
@entity310 : in the biggest copyright infringement case prior to tuesday 's ruling , @entity311 was accused of using the @entity315 song he 's @entity316 in creating his solo song @entity318			0
the case dragged on for five years , ultimately making its way to a @entity223 federal court , where @entity311 lost and was forced to pay $ 1,599,987 , a staggering amount at the time			0
@entity325 vs. @entity324 : @entity326 used elements of the @entity325 song @entity328 in his song of the same name , and as a result ended up having to pay $ 5.4million , when the case went to court , which before tuesday was the largest amount ever awarded in a copyright infringement case .			2

a jury awarded the family of @entity2 $ 7.4million in their lawsuit against @entity5 and @entity3
@entity10 's children @entity10 , @entity190 and @entity196 sued the singers in 2013 saying they stole the music to @entity8 from their father
@entity3 told jurors he did n't write @entity8 , which @entity5 testified he crafted in about an hour in mid- 2012
@entity10 's daughter @entity10 wept as the verdict was being read
' i feel free , free from ... @entity5 ’ & @entity3 ’s chains , ' said @entity10 in an emotional statement outside the courtroom following the verdict
the song made a staggering $ 16million for @entity5 , @entity3 and rapper @entity21
