@entity0 thought @entity1 were not getting enough out of their players			1
he thought the younger ones should get more of a chance			0
@entity5 , 19 , was removed at half - time against @entity7 and replaced by a 36 - year - old with flu , having been given a terrible time by @entity11			1
@entity7 were leading 3 - 0 by then			2
@entity12 played a full 90 minutes and looked heavy and poor			1
so there was no secret stash of talent , ignored by the previous manager			1
@entity5 ( right ) finds it tough going against @entity18 and was substituted at half - time @entity20 tries to point @entity12 in the right direction but @entity1 look to be heading down fighting relegation all season , @entity1 would have been one of the easiest teams to make			1
a talented youngster or an outcast like @entity12 would have been instantly recalled had there been the slightest spark or inclination			0
there are some clubs — and @entity33 has proved that @entity34 are one — where an underachieving group can be energised			0
that is n’t the case at @entity1			0
the best players were playing and were n’t good enough			0
it really was no more complicated than that			0
@entity43 ( left ) looks dejected with team - mates @entity44 and flu - victim @entity46 , who replaced @entity5 @entity0 will be in no doubt now that the players at @entity49 are not good enough to stay up			2

with @entity1 *rooted* in the relegation *zone* , @entity0 thought the club should give their youth players a chance in the first team
@entity5 started the 3 - 1 loss at @entity7 but was substituted at half - time for a 36 - year - old with flu
@entity12 played 90 minutes and looked heavy and poor
so there was no secret stash of talent , ignored by the previous manager
