with its dainty wooden ticket booths , tiled walls and rickety old trains , @entity2 's @entity1 line must be among the world 's most beautiful undergrounds			1
but that does n't make it one of the friendliest			0
we have committed the cardinal subway sin : not ' validating ' our tickets ( by inserting them into a stamping machine on the platform )			0
the punishment ? an 8,000 forints ( £ 20 ) fine			0
@entity2 can only get better			1
a @entity19 delight : @entity2 sits prettily on the banks of western @entity22 's longest river the @entity24 capital - which divides into the hilly @entity25 on the @entity19 's western bank and the flatter , more commercial pest on the eastern bank - has plenty of architectural splendours and cultural treasures , plus indulgent food and a lively nightlife			1
the city 's cheap prices - around £ 2 for a pint - attract stag do parties , but fortunately the local bars do n't seem to specifically target these groups			1
we decide to see the main sights by bike and join a cycling tour run by @entity44 called wheels and meals			0
moments after meeting - and with barely a glance each way - our energetic guide , @entity46 , leads us full pelt into @entity2 's busiest square - @entity51			1
we race around central @entity52 , stopping every five minutes for @entity46 to divulge titbits			1
for example , the @entity54 is reminiscent of the @entity56 ( though smaller , so as not to outshine the seat of the @entity58 ) and the magnificent neo-gothic @entity59 was inspired by @entity61			0
now confident whizzing two - wheeled through the city , we speed along the riverfront			1
scenes of @entity24 life : local men focus on the serious pursuit of chess ( and try desperately not to drop any pieces ) at @entity2 's @entity70 ( left ) ; @entity72 's @entity71 , on the pest side of the river ( right ) the sun is glistening on the @entity19 , cruise boats are pootling past ... when i suddenly fly off my bike and crash to the ground			1
my boyfriend had somehow managed to wedge his handlebars under mine , thus careering me into the kerb			0
more embarrassed than injured , we cross the river to the medieval town of @entity25 , a @entity88			1
behind the fairytale - like @entity89 - used as a cattle shed by the invading @entity92 - is @entity93 , whose turrets provide the best views of @entity52 ( and one of the settings for @entity99 )			1
after a big bowl of goulash soup at the charmingly low - key @entity102 , we are back in our saddles			2
the final hours of our tour take in the wide boulevards of @entity107 district , @entity108 and the bizarre @entity109 - with its mix of @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and romanesque styles			2
a scene from a different era : the city 's famous @entity118 looks like a refugee from another century afterwards , we collapse into leather armchairs for coffee and cakes at the city 's legendary @entity125 café			2
@entity24 have a reputation for being stand - offish , but with a little persistence , seemingly frosty locals quickly warm up and keenly offer recommendations about their city			1
understandably , however , they do n't readily discuss life under communist rule			0
and you will need plenty of energy to tackle the @entity137 - a museum which commemorates victims of that communist dictatorship , and those of the preceding @entity142 years			2
with all of the explanatory text on the walls in @entity24 , an @entity146 audio guide is crucial			0
twenty - five minutes ' drive away lies another reminder of @entity24 's soviet history : @entity150 , the unusual home for a collection of redundant communist statues , which were torn down after the regime collapsed in 1989			2
looking from the past to the future : the historic @entity25 district of the city gazes across at more modern @entity52 here , avoid a guide and do your own background reading instead			1
the only guide on offer was softly spoken with a thick @entity24 accent and had an infuriating habit of talking as she walked away from the group towards the next statue			0
combined with the noisy gravel crunching under 20 tourists ' feet and endless overhead planes , the tour was virtually inaudible			0
more subtle reminders of the nation 's difficult history are the abandoned @entity176 and @entity177 buildings , plus other crumbling structures now reincarnated as sprawling bars known as ' ruin pubs '			0
at the end of a frantic weekend , we forgo these watering holes , instead treating ourselves to a soak in the 21 different pools at the @entity70 @entity92 baths			0
@entity188 ( www.easyjet.com ) flies from @entity189 to @entity2 from £ 52 return			2

@entity2 has an image as a stag *destination* , but has a lot more to offer
it is is city of two *halves* - the @entity19 dividing the @entity25 and @entity52 districts
visitors can find historic public baths and echoes of the @entity208 era
