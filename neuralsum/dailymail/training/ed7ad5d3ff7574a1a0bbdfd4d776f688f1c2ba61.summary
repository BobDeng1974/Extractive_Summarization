' scroll down for audio the campaign of @entity2 , a former state senator running for @entity17 in the district that includes @entity34 , @entity3 , authorized a robocall gun - rights campaign on the day after a shooting and stabbing spree that left six dead battle lines : @entity40 graduate student @entity39 holds up a sign that reads ' @entity42 ' in a one - man protest following the weekend rampage of 22 - year old @entity45 a community grieves : @entity47 pays his respects at a makeshift memorial in front of the @entity51 , where part of friday night 's mass shooting took place @entity2 spokesman @entity55 told @entity56 that the ' calls were scheduled before friday 's shooting , ' and that they ' went to a small universe of @entity20 supporters and were completed instantly			1
' he gave the @entity62 a more anodyne statement , saying ' our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and victims of this tragedy			0
' ' protect our gun rights ! vote for @entity2 for @entity17 ! ' @entity2 has a history of protecting our @entity20 rights and will do the same in @entity17			1
' @entity2 was a founding member of the @entity74 and former @entity75 and @entity77 legislator of the year			0
' @entity2 has been a longtime supporter of the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms and will continue to oppose , and actively fight , any legislation that would take away our @entity20 right to bear arms			2

' on friday night @entity40 ' virgin killer ' @entity45 stabbed his two roommates and another student to death , and then shot and killed two sorority girls and a male student			1
a @entity3 political media buyer told @entity56 that most robocall vendors can cancel campaigns at any time , at the potential cost of the full value of the campaign			1
@entity2 ' may have decided that he had more to lose by canceling than he did by going ahead with it , ' the ad - woman said , requesting anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the subject matter – and because she works for other @entity16 candidates statewide			2
' but just one phone call – ironic , huh ? – could have prevented this			1
' @entity108 , founder of the @entity109 , said @entity2 's robocall should be considered in light of the anti-gun rhetoric that leapt to the forefront immediately after the shooting			1

what about @entity136 ’s right to live ? ' a visibly anguished @entity135 cried ' when will this insanity stop ? when will enough people say , " stop this madness ! we do n’t have to live like this ! " ? ' too many have died			0
we should say to ourselves : " not one more "			0
' when police found his body , @entity45 was surrounded by three semi-automatic handguns and nearly 400 rounds of ammunition , which had all been purchased legally			0
' the timing could hardly be more tasteless , ' wrote blogger @entity157 , who first surfaced a recording of the robocall at @entity160			0
@entity2 has n't spoken publicly about the shooting , and his robocall may ensure that he does n't killer : @entity164 - born student @entity45 , 22 , son of @entity166 film director @entity165 , murdered six people friday night in the @entity34 district of @entity169 , @entity3 the @entity170 showed reporters photos of the @entity173 and @entity175 handguns that @entity45 had with him on friday night ' @entity2 actually represented @entity169 and @entity34 in the @entity176 until late 2012 , ' he wrote , ' and many of these victims were likely [ his ] former constituents			1
