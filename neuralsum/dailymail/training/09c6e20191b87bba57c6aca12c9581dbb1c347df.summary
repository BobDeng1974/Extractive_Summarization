@entity0 and @entity1 have been in the game long enough to witness shock results			1
they have seen games and moments of brilliance that endure			0
@entity10 can be pleased with a scrappy yet solid victory and their first clean sheet of the season , taking them to seventh in the table			2
@entity16 sank to the bottom , with the worst defensive record in the top flight			2
they have conceded 15 goals in seven games and demonstrated precious little talent in attack			0
for @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , who all had long spells at @entity30 , it was an unhappy return to their old stamping ground			1
but no former @entity33 was more dissatisfied by @entity16 ’s fifth consecutive away defeat than their manager			2
@entity10 's @entity36 ( left ) and @entity37 ( centre ) celebrate @entity36 scoring the second goal in their win over @entity16 on sunday @entity36 ( left ) gives the thumbs up to the bench after he found the net for the fifth time in five starts for the @entity10 @entity10 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity46 7 ; @entity47 6 , @entity48 7.5 , @entity49 6 , @entity50 6 ; song 6 , @entity52 6.5 ; @entity53 6 , @entity37 7.5 , @entity36 6.5 ; @entity54 6 subs : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 @entity0 : 7 @entity16 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity26 5.5 ; @entity63 5 , @entity27 5 , @entity64 5 , @entity65 6 ; @entity66 5 , @entity67 5.5 ; @entity68 5 ( @entity28 45 ) , @entity69 5 , @entity70 5.5 ; @entity71 6 subs : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity28 , @entity78 @entity1 : 5 @entity1 has made a few tough calls in his time and he might be tempted to ring the changes at @entity16			1
he passed on this message from first - team coach @entity83 , who was watching from the stands , to his assistant @entity85			0
@entity16 did not have @entity10 ’s number on sunday ... @entity1 , who spent seven years at @entity10 from 1994 , lamented the lack of fitness among his team , singling out £ 10million new boy @entity66 , whom he hauled off after an unremarkable 67 minutes			1
‘ i put a lot of faith in him when i brought him in , ’ @entity1 said of the @entity91 midfielder secured from @entity92			2
‘ he ’s had an injury and we need to get him fit			0
the doctor told me at half - time that he could only play another five minutes			2
a few of the players are still not up to speed and peak fitness			0
people like @entity75 , who i brought in , have not managed to put two games together			0
it ’s a problem for us			0
’ asked about @entity113 ’s @entity112 assessment of @entity16 ’s performance as ‘ diabolical , ’ @entity1 replied : ‘ we were n’t great , that ’s for sure			1
it ’s his opinion is n’t it ? i have seen some diabolical performances of late as well but we wo n’t go into that one			0
’ @entity0 ’s new signings , meanwhile , have bedded in seemingly without problem			2
@entity117 , who arrived for £ 4.5m from @entity119 side @entity118 , got his fifth goal in as many starts			2
@entity36 , who revealed he is driven by the need to provide for his poverty - stricken family in @entity124 , showed plenty of desire , patiently waiting to head home a @entity48 cross			1
‘ i expected him to spend maybe 10 or 15 games for us finding out about the @entity131 , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ but he is so desperate to do well and his runs are so good			1
he seems to have the knack of turning up in the right place at the right time			0
that ’s fantastic for him and absolutely outstanding for us			0
that goes for all the signings			0
‘ we did n’t really make any defensive errors today			0
i thought the focus and the concentration was very good			0
he said : ‘ i have always wanted to play in @entity173 and when @entity10 came in for me in the summer , i thought that was it			2
but then the deal began to fall through as i think the coach was having doubts and i was resigned to returning to @entity119			0
‘ fortunately for me , mr @entity171 stepped in and said he would be signing me and on a permanent deal			0
it was the chance i needed			0
i had heard @entity16 did n’t want me so i wanted to prove i could do it			2
@entity10 gave me the chance and now mr @entity0 believes in me too			1
’ @entity10 took the lead after five minutes			1
the resurgent @entity37 , @entity0 ’s man of the match , whipped the ball over the heads of several white shirts and the flailing arms of @entity148 towards the far post			1
@entity16 ’s @entity63 , making his first start of the season , angled the ball into the net with his thigh			1
@entity26 looked dumbstruck , first gesturing for handball then reprimanding his struggling defenders			0
@entity10 missed a plum opportunity to double their lead moments later when @entity36 accelerated past @entity27 and pulled the ball back across the box only for @entity54 to poke the ball wide of the post			1
@entity16 , who have n’t won at @entity30 for 21 years , had only one significant chance in the first half when @entity206 made a zipping run into the box , slotting the ball through @entity48 ’ legs			1
@entity206 ignored the shouts of @entity70 to pull the ball back , instead blasting it at @entity46 , who saved comfortably enough			0
@entity16 were briefly enlivened by the introduction of @entity28 at half - time			1
within minutes , the 33 - year - old , who grew up just a few stops on the tube from @entity30 , set up @entity71 with a decent chance and won a free kick			1
but @entity10 extended their lead after 59 minutes			1
@entity167 ’s volley was blocked and @entity48 collected on the bounce and lobbed over several defenders for @entity36 to head home			1
there was more drama moments later when @entity26 took a free - kick in the box which was intercepted by @entity54 , hovering seven yards away			2
the @entity229 international buried the ball in the net but the goal was disallowed by referee @entity234			0
@entity16 defender @entity27 , who appeared 174 times for the @entity10 , makes his point known to his team - mates during their defeat @entity16 keeper @entity26 ( right ) is left high and dry when a @entity48 shot loops to the far post and is headed home by @entity36 @entity148 ( left ) is more animated than goal - scorer @entity36 after @entity10 scored their second of the match dangerous throughout , @entity37 takes the ball forward for @entity10 at the @entity30 @entity54 ( left ) puts his shot into the back of the net but was too close to keeper @entity26 ( right ) when the free - kick was taken @entity36 ( left ) and @entity54 ( centre ) argue with referee @entity234 after @entity10 had a goal rightly disallowed @entity16 keeper @entity26 passed the ball straight to @entity54 , who put it in the back of the net , but @entity234 deemed the striker to have not been back 10 yards @entity54 ( front ) backs into a robust challenge from @entity16 's @entity66 @entity16 's @entity27 ( left ) walks off the pitch dejected after the final whistle in the loss which takes the west @entity262 club to the bottom of the @entity131			1

@entity0 's @entity10 *accounted* for @entity1 's @entity16 2 - 0 at @entity30 on sunday *afternoon*
@entity10 took the lead after four minutes with a *controversially* - *awarded* own goal from @entity63
@entity16 players claimed @entity148 handled the ball as @entity37 's *quality* cross was whipped in
@entity36 scored his fifth goal in five starts at the far post to make it 2 - 0 after @entity48 ' shot was deflected
@entity148 thought he *'d* made it 3 - 0 when @entity26 gifted him a pass but the striker had *n't* retired 10 yards
@entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 all endured an unhappy return to their former club
@entity16 *slumped* to the bottom of the @entity131 table on goal *difference* after conceding 15 in seven matches
