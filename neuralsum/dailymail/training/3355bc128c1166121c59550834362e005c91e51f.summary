but it appears that @entity8 ’s notorious parking attendants saw her as nothing more than an errant motorist , and gave her a ticket for leaving her vehicle in a disabled bay			1
miss @entity2 , 43 , abandoned her car in the city ’s @entity16 as she rushed to the aid of a young woman sprawled face down on the pavement			1
annoyed : @entity2 was given a parking ticket for leaving her vehicle in a disabled bay in @entity8 after she leapt out of her car to help a collapsed woman however after helping the casualty recover in a nearby bank , miss @entity2 returned to her car to find she had been booked for illegal parking			1
the credit control manager had been driving to work at a book wholesaler in @entity30 , @entity8 , when she spotted the woman ‘ out cold ’ and pulled over to help			1
she said : ‘ i thought the girl was dead at first , but after a while she regained consciousness and i think she ’d had a seizure or blacked out			0
‘ obviously , i panicked when i saw that and parked up quickly to get to her			0
at the same time two people arrived to help and when she came round she was a bit groggy and dazed			0
‘ she was complaining of stomach pains , so we took her into the @entity43 to keep her warm and called an ambulance			0
‘ it was while we were in there i noticed i was getting a parking ticket – it had been a matter of moments			2
‘ my only concern was for the lady on the street , i was n’t looking where i was parking			1
’ @entity53 : despite her kind actions , it appears that @entity8 's notorious parking attendants saw miss @entity2 as nothing more than an errant motorist bosses at @entity60 , which manages the city ’s parking attendants , said they were ‘ entirely satisfied ’ that their attendant acted in a ‘ sympathetic and professional way ’			1
but miss @entity2 , from @entity65 , @entity66 , branded her treatment as ‘ yet another example of an over-zealous parking attendant ’ who was ‘ chasing commission ’			1
she said : ‘ the parking attendant must have looked over and seen the commotion going on			2

’ it is understood the ill woman was taken to hospital by paramedics			2
her condition is not known			0
onlookers said that they were astonished as they watched the parking attendant move in on the car			2
a shopworker who had a clear view of the incident said : ‘ we saw the woman being helped by some people and then being taken into the bank			0
‘ next thing there was a parking attendant looking at the cars and he started writing a ticket			0
it ’s unbelievable he could do that			0
