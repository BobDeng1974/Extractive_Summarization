by @entity0 a @entity2 family is speaking out about being forced to spend all their savings to fix a new home that partiers broke into and trashed just hours after they closed on the place			1
the @entity9 family was horrified when they got to their new home to find it covered in urine , vomit , and cigarette burns			1
and their discoveries only got worse			0
the @entity17 would soon find damages to the house they 'd bought move - in ready that amounted to $ 30,000			0
trashed : a @entity2 couple 's new home was completely trashed by partiers who broke in just hours after they closed on the place filthy : the four bedroom home was ready for @entity9 and his family to move in when they bought it but the next time the showed up , there were cigarette burns in every floor , holes in the wall and filth everywhere ruined : floors were ruined throughout the home and the @entity17 , who 'd only just bought the place , started draining their savings and putting materials on credit cards to fix the place back up that 's without labor costs			1
@entity9 , a home contractor , told @entity46 that he 's done all the work himself			2
' they urinated in cabinets , ' revealed @entity9			2
' there ’s cigarette burns all over all the floors , the carpets , the laminates , i mean there was alcohol spilled everywhere , there was vomit all over the place , and they broke the handrails up the stairs			2
' the @entity17 hauled three @entity64 worth of cast off booze bottles and other filth from the home			2
because the @entity69 home was outfitted with custom windows and kitchen cabinets , the @entity17 had to replace every cabinet and window -- even the non-damaged ones			1
but the costly damage did n't end there			0
the partiers did damage to the actual structure of the home , as well			0
pricey : @entity80 happens to be a contractor and the family spent around $ 30,000 on materials alone as he did all the construction work himself custom job : because the windows were custom made for the home , @entity9 had to replace all of them , not just the damaged ones ' i guess a whole bunch of people got out there , and it caved in , and so we had to replace the flat part of the roof , too , ' ' it ’s been close to $ 30,000 , probably , and that ’s just materials and buying stuff , and that ’s just with me doing all the work , ' he told @entity46			1
adding insult to injury , one girl from the party even returned to the home to get something she 'd left			0
' some girl showed up in our driveway wanting to get her beer pong table back from the party , ' recalled a very annoyed @entity9			1
the @entity114 police say they 're actively investigating the incident and that they have several persons of interest			0
insult to injury : one partygoer even returned to the home and asked @entity9 for her beer pong table back the @entity17 hauled three dumpsters full of trash out of the home that was left by partygoers while authorities have released no names of suspects , the @entity17 -- who say they 've seen photos of and conversations about the party on @entity129 -- believe a former occupant of the home has something to do with it			1
the timing of the break - in , right after the @entity17 closed , appears to support that hunch			0
if found , police could charge suspects with trespassing and burglary , though that wo n't help the @entity17 get back their savings or pay down credit cards			1
to receive any financial restitution , the family will have to file a civil lawsuit .			0
