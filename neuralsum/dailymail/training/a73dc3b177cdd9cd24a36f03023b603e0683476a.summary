@entity0 has a list of 20 - goal - a - season strikers from which he picks one at random and watches videos of them before every game			1
it includes @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			2
viewing highlights of these stars on @entity15 is clearly rubbing off on the 21 - year - old @entity16 forward who is setting the @entity18 alight this season , sitting top of the scoring charts with eight goals in eight games			1
‘ before every game i watch videos of different strikers and try to pick up different things from all of them , ’ says @entity0 , who was born in @entity24 but moved to @entity25 aged eight months			1
@entity0 has proven he is more than capable of scoring goals in the championship forest striker @entity33 , pictured scoring against @entity36 at the @entity37 , has been in fine form @entity33 has revealed he takes inspiration from the likes of @entity8 and @entity11 ‘ i go on @entity15 and pick a name at random and watch it			1
i ’ve got quite a few on the list , strikers that score over 20 goals a season			1
@entity11 is probably one of my favourites with @entity9			2
@entity12 when he was at @entity50			2
’ it is testament to @entity53 ’s defence that they kept the burly , bustling forward at bay for the whole of saturday ’s goalless draw			2
that was the first time @entity16 had failed to score in 10 games this season , although the point kept @entity64 ’s side unbeaten and top of the league			1
@entity68 striker @entity67 continued his scoring run but failed to net three consecutive hat - tricks for the first time since @entity50 ’s @entity72 in 1946			1
@entity67 could only manage one against @entity73			0
@entity74 continued their unbeaten run under caretaker manager @entity76 with a 3 - 0 victory against @entity78			1
@entity76 , however , missed out on the top job			0
@entity81 won 5 - 4 against @entity82 in @entity84 ’s first game in his second spell in charge at the club			2
they now have three victories in four games			2
@entity33 , whose father @entity91 was an international for @entity24 ( now @entity24 ) , gave centre back @entity93 a fierce shove in the fourth minute to let the @entity53 captain know he was there			0
the pair were pulling and jostling each other all game and @entity100 , 32 , played the young hopeful well			0
forest manager @entity64 pointed out afterwards that @entity33 still has much to learn			1
‘ with young players expectation goes through the roof very quickly and we have to make it clear he is a young man who ’s learning the game , ’ said @entity64			1
‘ i sat with him after the match and said , “ look , tactically you might have had to go and play on the other centre half			0
” @entity100 , i think , played him very well			0
i use the example of @entity115 , who was very clever when he played up front for @entity117 and @entity118			0
he looked at the two central defenders and said , “ well , i might not play against you , @entity120 , because you can run as quick as me , but i ’m coming over there to play against you because you ’re a bit of a donkey			0
” @entity123 's @entity53 managed to keep the @entity18 's top scorer at bay on saturday ‘ @entity0 has got to learn those nuances of football , but he has such an attitude to want to learn , and want to work for the team , it ’s fantastic			1
’ @entity132 18 - year - old midfielder @entity131 celebrated signing a new three - year deal by netting a hat - trick in his side ’s 6 - 1 mauling of @entity137			1
@entity138 , who was subject of a £ 3.5million bid from @entity50 in the summer , is fast developing a reputation as one of brightest young @entity143 talents and has six goals in 10 games this season			1
a true test of that ability will come when he faces @entity150 in the @entity152 third round on wednesday			0
there is a hunger to @entity33 ’s style			0
he is constantly on the shoulder of the last man , or making forays out wide when space opens up			0
he charges down defenders on the ball , hassles and hustles for the full 90 minutes			0
as soon as there is a stoppage he is alert , on his toes , seeking space , moving a few yards clear of the nearest defender			0
it will not be a poor work ethic which stops @entity33 reaching his target of the @entity172			0
training - ground sources tell @entity174 that he is always the first out and one of the last to leave			2
@entity33 sealed a £ 5million move from @entity177 to @entity16 in the summer they explain that he is enjoying the attention , following his club - record £ 5million move from @entity177 in the summer , but he is still very grounded			1
that is partly down to his modest rise , only joining @entity187 ’s academy at 17 and spending loan spells at non-league and lower - @entity172 sides			2
even after drawing a blank against @entity53 , it is @entity33 ’s name called out by a group of young fans as the @entity16 squad warm down			1
he jogs over to sign autographs and pose for photographs			0
no wonder , @entity33 is fast developing an impressive highlights reel of his own .			0
