@entity1 captain @entity0 believes there is a bright future for the @entity5 team despite their failure to reach the final of the 2014 @entity8			1
@entity5 's 16 - 14 defeat by @entity10 , followed by @entity12 's 44 - 18 triumph over @entity13 , in the last round of matches eliminated @entity17 's team from the tournament			1
the near - misses down under followed @entity5 's agonising @entity22 semi-final defeat by the @entity23 12 months ago but @entity0 , who has been part of @entity17 's coaching staff for the last two years , insists the good times are not far away			1
@entity0 believes @entity5 will become a force in @entity28 , despite the disappointing @entity8 exit @entity30 is blocked off by the @entity10 defence in @entity5 's 16 - 14 @entity8 defeat on saturday @entity33 holds off the @entity5 players , as @entity10 and @entity12 winning sent @entity5 out ' it 's an exciting future , given the average age of the squad , ' @entity0 said			1
' there are some good , young players like @entity40 , who showed what he is capable of in this tournament , and @entity43 who unfortunately did n't get a run but i 'm sure will develop into a great player for his country as well			1
' the signs are there			0
although it was a disappointing end to the tour this time around , i certainly think there is a better future ahead			0
' as a team , we 've really put a stamp on world rugby			0
we 've showed we are more than competitive and , moving forward , it promises to be a really exciting three - match series against @entity10 next year			2
the last two games against the @entity23 have been extremely close and i expect it to be very similar next year			0
' @entity0 , who won the last of his 31 international caps for @entity63 and @entity5 in the 2008 @entity22 , says he has been blown away by the professionalism of the current set - up			1
' i was five years out of the @entity5 set - up and the change in that time has been remarkable , ' he added			2
' it was quite clear to me that there 's been a lot of hard work done behind scenes to put a stamp on this @entity5 team , to bring these people together			2
@entity0 believes @entity17 ( above ) can shape @entity5 into a dangerous team on the world stage ' quite often people talk about the two - team mentality where players come from their respective clubs and really buy into what we are trying to achieve with @entity5 and this has shown with how they get on together in the @entity5 camp			1
' the attitudes are fantastic , it 's clear to see they enjoy their time with each other and they 're making some huge strides			0
' the 34 - year - old @entity0 , who went straight from @entity1 ' grand - final triumph into the @entity8 , will report back for pre-season training with his club later this month ahead of what is expected to be his final season as a player			0
he is tipped to join @entity98 's coaching staff at @entity99 and is also set to remain part of the @entity5 set - up if , as seems likely , @entity17 remains in charge for the visit of the @entity23 next autumn			2
@entity0 has tipped @entity43 ( centre ) to grow into an important @entity5 player in future years ' it 's been an unbelievable experience for me personally , ' he said			1
' i suppose i 'm quite unique in that obviously i 'm still playing but i 've made no secret of the fact that i would like to get into coaching when i hang up my boots and this experience has been beyond my wildest dreams			0
' not many coaches get the opportunity so early in their career to become involved with some of the best players in the world and i consider myself very fortunate			0
' i 'm sure it will stand me in good stead for the future			0

@entity5 were eliminated in the last round of matches after @entity10 loss
but @entity0 said that the side will improve with the added experience
he tipped @entity40 and @entity43 to become key @entity5 players
