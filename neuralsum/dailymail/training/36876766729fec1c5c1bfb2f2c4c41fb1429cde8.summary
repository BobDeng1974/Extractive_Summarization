a stunned shopper has ridiculed troubled supermarket @entity1 after being told she needed @entity3 to buy fruit because it could ferment and turn into alcohol			1
@entity6 , 37 , from @entity7 , was trying to buy a packet of melon and grapes at the self - service checkout of a @entity1 when a warning appeared saying the product was age restricted			1
she left the store when no staff member came to help , and when she contacted @entity1 to complain she was told the fruit was age restricted because it can be turned into alcohol			1
@entity6 , 37 , from @entity7 , was asked for @entity3 while buying a pack of melon and grapes from a self - service till in a @entity1 store , and was later told this was because it could ferment and turn into alcohol in an email she was also told that all @entity1 fruit could soon become age restricted in case natural fermentation occurred			1
ms @entity6 said she could n't believe the response , adding that it was ' crazy ' and went against health advice to get children to eat more fruit			2
ms @entity6 , who works in @entity36 library , said : ' it just seemed like a bizarre reason			0
when i got the response from @entity1 i told my friend at work and we fell about laughing			2
' it ’s just ridiculous , you could n’t make it up			0
they would be doing the exact opposite to what is recommended , they promote healthy eating in kids			0
' government health advice suggests eating five portions of fruit and vegetables every day , but some experts want this upped to seven after a study by @entity59			0
their research showed that eating more fruit and vegetables cuts the risk of premature death by 42 per cent , cutting risk of cancer by a quarter and heart - related deaths by a third			0
the study also showed that canned or frozen fruit and veg is not as healthy as frozen , and raised questions about the benefits of juice , which currently counts towards the five - a - day total			0
ms @entity6 said she ' fell about laughing ' after reading the letter , which added that all fruit could soon be age restricted			1
@entity1 have since clarified that this is not company policy ( file image ) in order to ferment fruit into alcohol it usually has to be chopped or mashed into a pulp , then mixed with water and yeast and allowed to stand for just over a week			1
this will produce a weak alcoholic mixture , and will either need to be fermented further to produce wine , or distilled in order to produce a hard spirit			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ' our customer service colleague ’s comment about natural fermentation was meant as a joke – we ’re sorry if it was taken literally			1
' of course we have no plans to age restrict fruit sales			0
our team have apologised for any confusion and are sending mrs @entity6 a fruit basket as a gesture of goodwill			2
' the spokesman added that it was not immediately clear why an alarm on the till had gone off , but said the store does not think it was related to @entity3 .			2

@entity6 , 37 , was buying fruit from self - service till in @entity1
till *message* said she needed @entity3 , and when staff ignored her she left
@entity1 told her that fruit was restricted because it could be fermented
but store has since clarified saying comments were meant as a joke
