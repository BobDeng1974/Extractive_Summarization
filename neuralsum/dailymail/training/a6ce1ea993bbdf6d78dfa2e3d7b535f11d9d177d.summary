by political correspondent tens of thousands of primary pupils are sitting tougher exams brought back by @entity4 in 2012 tens of thousands of 11 - year - olds are being stretched by more difficult tests that have been revived by education secretary @entity4			1
only the brightest pupils are expected to pass the tougher versions of level 6 exams			1
@entity11 axed the exams , which test 11 - year - olds with material more suitable for 14 - year - olds , in 2002 before the @entity16 brought them back in 2012 for maths and reading			1
last year , the tests were also brought in for grammar , punctuation and spelling			0
from 2016 , the current standard tests for 11 - year - olds will be replaced by a compulsory exam which will include many of the harder questions asked in the @entity28 6 papers			1
it means all youngsters will be expected to be taught at a higher level to meet the tougher exam requirements			2
currently , the @entity33 is optional and teachers tend to test only the most academic pupils with it			2
but figures released today show that primary schools are increasingly using them to challenge students and raise aspiration			0
last year , just 3 per cent – 2,200 out of 70,000 pupils – who sat the reading exam reached a @entity28 6 pass			1
just 8,500 out of 59,000 passed the spelling , punctuation and grammar test ( 14 per cent ) while under half – 35,000 out of 78,000 – passed the maths test			0
a @entity52 spokesman said : ‘ we brought back these tests because we wanted to give teachers the chance to set high aspirations for pupils in literacy and numeracy			0
‘ we want to see every school stretching all their pupils			0
these figures show that primary schools have embraced the opportunity to stretch their brightest 11 - year - olds by teaching them more demanding new material , in line with the new curriculum , and by entering them for the @entity28 test			1
’ from 2016 , the current standard tests for 11 - year - olds will be replaced by a compulsory exam which will include many of the harder questions asked in the @entity28 6 papers mr @entity4 has said : ‘ it is plain wrong to set a ceiling on the talents of the very brightest pupils and let them drift in class			1
' letting teachers offer @entity28 6 tests means that the most talented children will be fully stretched and start secondary school razor - sharp			2
’ to achieve a @entity87 6 in reading , children have to trace an idea , explore different levels of meaning in a text and explain how a writer tries to influence a reader			0
those sitting a @entity87 6 in maths have to convert between fractions , decimals and percentages , explain number patterns through graphs and algebra and understand formulae for calculating volume and area			0
to gain a @entity87 6 in grammar , punctuation and spelling , pupils must use complex nouns , a range of verb forms and understand subordinate clauses as well as use semi-colons properly .			0
