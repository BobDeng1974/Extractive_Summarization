by @entity0 published : 15:41 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 01:53 est , 31 july 2013 two officers in uniform smile proudly for the camera as @entity5 rages just a few miles away in these newly - unearthed photographs			1
but all is not as it seems in this fascinating yet seemingly innocuous image , believed to have been taken in october 1916			0
the young officer saluting and wearing a @entity12 uniform and distinctive ' lemon - squeezer ' hat is , in fact , a woman			1
this image is not of a young , fresh - faced officer in @entity5 , but a mystery @entity17 woman lovers or friends ? little evidence about the pair 's relationship exists			1
the pictures seem playful , even intimate , and suggest two people at ease with one another the discovery of the image has sparked excitement and no little speculation among @entity5 scholars , who believe they have identified the male officer in the pictures			1
but mystery still surrounds the identity of the woman , believed to be @entity17 and in her late twenties to early thirties			1
the intimacy of the photos suggest a deep friendship - and possibly even more - between the @entity12 officer and the vivacious , evidently modern lady			1
he is believed to be captain @entity45 , born in @entity46 , @entity47 , in march 1880 , and therefore 36 to 38 at the time of the photographs			2
he was identified from his collar and cap badges as a member of the 7th @entity53			0
his companion has put on his first lieutenant 's tunic , his @entity58 hat , his baggy officer 's trousers , belts , puttees and even his spurs			2
intriguingly , she has an engagement or wedding ring on her left hand			0
speculation also arises from the picture where she is sat on the dashing officer 's knee , her hand placed tenderly on his shoulder			2
@entity12 historian @entity76 believes he has correctly identified the officer			1
he said : ' in the records of the @entity12 @entity80 there are only two officers who meet these criteria			1
one of these did not reach the rank of captain , leaving @entity45 as the prime candidate '			0
' his service record fits the man in these images like a glove			0
he was transferred from the @entity90 to serve with the @entity12 division headquarter staff behind the lines of the @entity93 in april , may and june 1916			1
he was transferred back to the same @entity80 battalion when the @entity58 entered the battle [ from 15 september ]			0
transformation : in this photograph it becomes clear that the young officer is actually a woman			1
but the true nature of the couple 's relationship is lost in the mists and murk of the @entity5 ' he was promoted to first lieutenant in october 1916			1
he won the @entity107 in june 1918			0
' the building seen in the background of the garden shots has been identified by a local historian and blogger , @entity113 , as the ' @entity114 ' on the @entity115 in @entity116 , near @entity117			0
the pictures were found among a batch of 21 glass photographic plates , found in @entity116 , 30 miles east of the battlefields of 1916 , unearthed as part of @entity124 's series of ' lost images ' of the @entity5			1
@entity126 , proprietor of the ' @entity128 ' café in @entity129 in the heart of the @entity93 battlefield , was the first to realise the young officer and the woman were one and the same			2
captain @entity45 must have visited the woman at least twice because the images show him as both a first lieutenant and later as a captain			2
little more than that is known			0
is the ring on her finger an engagement ring from @entity45 or her wedding ring ? had her husband died in the fighting ? was he still at war ? one thing we know for sure - @entity45 returned unmarried to @entity12			2
somewhere along the way their relationship , whatever it was , ended			0
there is one final theory , almost impossibly tragic yet not beyond the realms of possibility			0
a flu pandemic swept @entity161 1918 , killing 400,000			0
among that grim toll was a sixth of @entity116 's population			0
did he return to @entity12 heartbroken and in mourning ? records show captain @entity45 never married			1
was he never able to recover from losing this playful , smiling woman , forever nursing bittersweet memories of an impossibly bright afternoon in a foreign garden ? we may never know .			0

mysterious ' officer ' from @entity5 is actually a @entity17 woman
she wore the uniform of a @entity12 captain called @entity178
little known about their relationship , but there are tantalising theories
