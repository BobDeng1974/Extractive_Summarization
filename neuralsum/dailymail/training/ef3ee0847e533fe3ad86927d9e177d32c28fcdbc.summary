a little girl who had more than 1,000 seizures a day has been cured by eating lots of cream and cheese			1
@entity5 , five , from @entity6 , @entity7 , sticks to a ' ketogenic ' diet rich in high - fat foods such as cheese , cream , butter and oil to control her epilepsy			1
since starting the plan in may she has improved dramatically and now has fewer than ten seizures each day			1
@entity5 , five , ( pictured ) was suffering from more than 1,000 seizures a day before she started on a diet rich in high - fat foods such as cheese , cream , butter and oil to control her epilepsy her mother @entity24 , 39 , said : ' before @entity5 started she was like a zombie , but after just two days she was running around and playing â€“ like a totally different child			1
' she hopes that @entity5 will be seizure - free in six months and able to come off the diet within a few years			2
she said : ' cream and cheese have been real life savers for us			2
' it 's strange giving your child so much fatty foods as you assume it 's going to be bad for them , and i certainly get some strange glances at my shopping trolley , but it 's been a miracle			0
@entity5 's mother @entity24 ( pictured ) said before she started the high - fat diet @entity5 was ' like a zombie ' - but after just two days she was running around and playing ' we hope that within six months @entity5 will be seizure free			1
' ' anything she eats we will add extra fat to , so smoothies with extra cream , or humus with extra oil , and her toast will have piles and piles of butter			1
' we 're always told that fat is bad for you , but it 's fat that is changing @entity5 's life			2
' the special diet forces the body to burn fats for fuel , rather than the glucose found in carbohydrates			0
this state , called ketosis , leads to a reduction in seizures , although why is still unclear			0
anything @entity5 eats has extra fat added - so she has smoothies with extra cream and toast with piles of butter her mother said : ' before @entity5 began her diet she was a mess , she would always be so tired , and never have the energy to do anything			1
' but after two days she was running around the park until the evening - it was unheard of and just so amazing to see			0
' her seizures massively decreased instantly and now they 've reduced by over 90 per cent			0
' she 's really chatty and can communicate well , and now even the special school that she goes to are questioning whether she should swap to a mainstream school			0
' her quality of life has just improved so much			0
' @entity5 now enjoys running around and playing in the park - something she could not do before the diet @entity5 's mother first noticed her condition when @entity5 began falling behind other children her age - but now there is a chance she will attend a mainstream school in the future @entity5 's ketogenic diet has been carefully calculated to ensure she is well nourished , whilst curbing her seizures			1
@entity24 said : ' @entity5 eats tons of cream , cheese , butter and oil , but there are lots of ways to make her foods really tasty			1
' her favourite snack is toast with lots of butter on it and sugar free maple syrup			0
' she eats tons of keto muffins and she really likes fat bombs too - they are basically small snacks made of dark chocolate and coconut oil			2
' anything she eats we will add extra fat to , so smoothies with extra cream , or humus with extra oil , and her toast will have piles and piles of butter on			1
' at the butcher 's i will ask him to give me the cut of meat that has the most fat on			0
' it 's funny because we 're always told that fat is bad for you , but it 's fat that is changing @entity5 's life			2
' her parents hope that soon @entity5 will be seizure free , drug free , and eventually she will be able to come off the diet in the next few years @entity24 first noticed @entity5 's condition when they noticed she was falling behind other children her age			2
she said : ' @entity5 had been doing perfectly as a baby but then stopped hitting her milestones			2
' she was very late at crawling and she did n't walk until she was almost two			0
' then i started getting very paranoid when i noticed her eyes sort of fluttering			0
' eventually she became diagnosed with global developmental delay in january 2012 , so we got her extra help - she had a speech and language therapist and support at school			0
' but then six months later i remember seeing her eye flutter again and it suddenly hit me that she was having a seizure - i knew she had epilepsy			0
' when she had a brain scan it showed that she 'd had over 20 seizures during the scan alone			0
' she was put on medication straight away , but after a honeymoon period she just got worse			0
' at one point last year she was having over 1,000 seizures a day			1
@entity5 's favourite snack on her high - fat diet is toast with lots of butter on it and sugar free maple syrup ' during the seizures she would be completely absent and out of it , it was quite scary			1
' luckily , a consultant suggested putting @entity5 on the ketogenic diet , and after funding issues at their local hospital , @entity24 turned to charity @entity176 for help			1
@entity180 's friends promote and support parents using the ketogenic diet for their children			2
@entity5 's mother said : ' @entity176 were amazing and really helped us out			0
' they were a great support network , especially during the early stages of the diet			0
' now , @entity24 hopes that @entity5 will soon be free from drugs and seizures			2
' the plan is that soon @entity5 will be seizure free , drug free , and eventually she 'll be able to come off the diet within the next few years			2
' the diet has truly changed her life , and i would urge any parent considering putting their child on it to do so			0
' there are some parents out there who do n't even know it exists and that 's a real travesty			0
' it 's been a miracle worker for @entity5 - the high fat diet has given us our daughter back			1
' breakfast : cereal with lots of emulsified full fat milk , smoothie with added full fat cream mid morning snack : @entity219 cake , cheese , small piece of apple lunch : half a piece of bread with lots of butter and some ham , with a yoghurt with extra cream snack : @entity231 mixed with extra oil and some carrot sticks dinner : @entity236 roast dinner with celeriac instead of potatoes and lots of oily gravy and keto muffin for desert supper : @entity219 pancake with whipped cream @entity246 , founder of @entity180 's @entity247 for @entity248 said : ' we are extremely proud of @entity5 and her family			1
' the ketogenic diet can mean a whole new way of thinking about food as we have all been brainwashed that ' fat is bad ' and that in itself can be extremely difficult for families to come to terms with			1
' when you embark on a medical ketogenic diet such as the one used for @entity5 , then we have to completely change our thinking to ' fat is good ' and the more of it the better			1
' to say to someone that ' butter made me better ' is an incredible claim but in this case it is completely true and has been for tens of thousands of people around the globe over the years , but please always make sure that you are medically supervised and never undertake a medical ketogenic diet without consulting with an experienced ketogenic dietitian			1
