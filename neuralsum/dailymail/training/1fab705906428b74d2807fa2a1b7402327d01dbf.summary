by @entity0 @entity1 feared he would have to have his foot amputated after he was bitten by a false widow spider a grandfather has told how he fought for his life - and his leg - after being bitten by one of @entity9 's most venomous spiders , leaving him with horrific injuries			1
@entity1 feared he would have to have his foot amputated after he was bitten by a false widow spider , which are currently believed to be plaguing @entity9			1
the infection caused by the creature 's bite was so bad his vital organs started ' shutting down ' as it spread throughout his body			1
mr @entity1 , 66 , was bitten on the toe by the spider while making a bonfire at his home in @entity23 , @entity24 , last year			1
he said he had brushed aside the small bite at first but soon became desperately unwell			0
he told the @entity27 that he began to shiver and feel strange and so drove to the doctors			0
but by the time he arrived he was so weak he could barely drive			0
his temperature had reached 104degrees and concerned medics quickly called for an ambulance			0
at first doctors believed the father of two was suffering from food poisoning , but his condition soon deteriorated and he was finally diagnosed with cellulitis , a severe skin infection			2
he said : ' over the two weeks i stayed in hospital , i was all swollen up and my leg turned dark red with huge blisters			2
' at one point my organs started shutting down and i had real problems with my kidneys			2
' one night my heart was racing like a marathon runner and i needed injections from doctors			0
' he said he ' wanted to die ' and was later told he was close to losing his leg after developing a streptococcal infection in the bite , which spread around his body , and to his other leg			1
he has spent the past year recovering from the ordeal but still struggles to walk			1
mr @entity1 's ordeal has emerged as the number of reported sightings and bites from false widows has exploded in recent weeks			1
decorator @entity65 , 39 , almost lost his leg when he suffered a horrific bite from @entity9 's most poisonous spider after disturbing a nest of false widows while working at a school			1
surgeons were forced to slice open his leg and flush out the venom after his thigh swelled to twice its normal size			1
mr @entity1 , 66 , ( pictured here holding an image of his injury and a jar containing a spider ) was bitten on the toe by the spider while making a bonfire at his home in @entity23 , @entity24 , last year and @entity82 , a 22 - year - old footballer from @entity83 also needed emergency surgery after a nasty bite from the spider			1
he said : ' when i woke up i had a pain in my side - a stinging feeling			2
i did n't take that much notice until it started swelling and the pain got worse			0
' i was in agony			0
i have never had pain like that before in my life			0
it 's still very painful now			2
i still ca n't sleep properly and find it virtually impossible to get in and out of a car			0
' there are fears that with temperatures outside plummeting as the winter months approach , millions of the spiders could make their way into homes across the country to escape the cold			2
traditionally they were only found in the south of @entity110 , but there are nests being found in @entity113 and @entity114			0
experts believe that the spiders my be thriving in the @entity9 because of a wet start to the summer followed by a heatwave			1
long - term climate change may also be to blame , leading spiders to set up home in new areas			1
however , some experts say many sightings of false widows could in fact be the common house spider			0
he was close to losing his leg after developing a streptococcal infection in the bite , which spread around his body and today an entire school announced it will close for a day to deal with an outbreak of @entity135			1
the @entity138 , in the @entity136 , @entity137 , will be shut while its buildings are fumigated after the creatures were found in its computer block as well as other areas			1
a statement said the school ' had identified an issue with false widow spiders ' in several buildings including @entity149 rooms			1
parents were sent a letter from vice principal @entity152 saying the school would be shut on the advice of pest controllers			1
initially a decision was taken to close only the @entity149 block , but further discoveries of the spiders elsewhere led to a full school closure			1
mr @entity152 wrote : ' we have identified an issue with false widow spiders in the academy in our @entity149 block and therefore took immediate advice from pest control			2
' we therefore made the decision to close the @entity149 block for the whole of today so that pest control could fumigate the area			0
' unfortunately , during this afternoon there have been further false widow spiders identified in other areas of the academy			2
' we have taken advice from the @entity177 at @entity178 and @entity179 , @entity180 and have taken the decision to close the academy all day on wednesday 23rd october 2013			0
' this will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone 's health and safety			2
' the spiders are distinctive for their shiny , black flesh , bulbous bodies , thick legs and skull - like patterns			1
millions of false widows , pictured right , @entity9 's most poisonous spider , are found across the @entity9 and the population is growing			1
also known as steatoda nobilis , it is frequently confused for the black widow , which has deadly venom			0
the false widow was first spotted in the @entity9 in @entity203 , @entity83 , in 1879			1
it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from @entity208 or the @entity209 in a shipment of bananas			0
the species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull			0
they have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size			0
the @entity219 says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the @entity9 , having been found mainly in southern @entity110			1
this theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to @entity226 to avoid bites and what to do if you get one the key message is that you should n't disturb spiders if you can help it because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened			2
to avoid it while asleep , remove everything from under the bed so that the only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the four legs			0
do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight			0
if you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and can not see inside			0
also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing things			0
if you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction , pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention .			0
