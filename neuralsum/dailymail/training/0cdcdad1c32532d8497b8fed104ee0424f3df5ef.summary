@entity1 captain @entity0 has lined up former @entity3 manager sir @entity2 to speak at the team dinner at @entity5 on tuesday evening			1
@entity2 is a friend of assistant captain @entity6 , and turned up to watch the @entity1 team practice on tuesday morning			1
his presence continues a recent tradition of star performers from other sports saying a few words in the team room			2
sir @entity2 will speak to the @entity1 @entity15 team at a dinner at @entity5 on tuesday @entity2 attended the @entity18 and @entity17 for national coaches in @entity20 last week four years ago it was @entity23 rugby legend @entity22 while @entity25 coach @entity24 spoke at @entity26 last time			1
' he 's a guy that i played with in the @entity30 pro-am about 15 years ago and that i 've seen now and again over that time , and when i became captain i asked him , " @entity0 said of the former @entity3 manager			1
' of course he was more than willing to help			2
but the one thing he asked me to do was keep it really quiet			2
walking around ( the course ) is not keeping it quiet , is it ? we wanted a bit of a surprise for the players but i guess it 's not a surprise			2
' @entity42 fan @entity0 joked that @entity2 would not be giving any of his team the famous " hairdryer " treatment , with the @entity42 coincidentally making the trip to @entity47 on saturday			1
' although i 'm a @entity42 fan , i 've always loved the way his teams played and there 's a number of things that he 's dealing with that he was particularly good at that i think he 'll be a particularly strong fit , ' @entity0 added			1
@entity25 manager @entity24 and his family pictured at @entity26 for the @entity15 in 2012 ' he 's asked me a lot of questions and i know he 's very keen and looking forward to tonight			1
he 's a big fan of golf , as we know			0
he knows @entity59 ( @entity60 ) very well and @entity59 is a big @entity3 fan			0
not everybody in the room is a @entity3 fan , so that should be a bit fun			0
' this is not about him being a headmaster and coming in and preaching to them			0
he 's very aware of that			0
there will be questions coming back at him			0
' they all love football and a chance to spend a bit of time with one of the greats in soccer does n't come around very often , particularly with somebody they all admire			0
in my dealings with him , he 's been absolutely fantastic and i know he 'll be great with the players			0
' @entity2 has turned up at a number of @entity89 events on the @entity90 over the years and is believed to play to a handicap of 18 .			1
