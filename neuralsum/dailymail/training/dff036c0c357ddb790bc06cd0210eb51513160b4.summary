by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 23:54 est , 6 november 2012 women in high - flying jobs earn almost half a million pounds less in their lives than men with identical careers , a damning report reveals today			1
they are also less likely to get a bonus and more likely to be made redundant			0
if they do receive a bonus , it is typically half the amount paid to a man doing exactly the same job			0
separate studies have shown that businesses in the @entity16 are ' spectacularly unsuccessful ' at promoting high - flying women experts yesterday insisted the gulf in earnings was impossible to justify and described the gender pay gap as ‘ disturbing ’			1
the research from the @entity23 is based on the experiences of nearly 39,000 @entity16 executives			1
it said that although the number of women working in senior positions at @entity31 companies is rising , it remains low , at 17.3 per cent			2
separate studies have shown that businesses in the @entity16 are ‘ spectacularly unsuccessful ’ at promoting high - flying women			1
the latest research takes the example of a man and a woman who start at the bottom of the executive career ladder at the age of 25 , win equal promotions and retire at 60			2
professor @entity41 says many women are blighted by a lack of confidence during their 35 - year careers , the woman will earn £ 1.09million but the man will earn £ 1.52million			1
the report stresses that the gender pay gap does not fully develop until women are in their thirties			1
in their twenties , male and female executives tend to earn roughly the same salary , with both being paid an average of around £ 23,000			0
but the gap gets wider as they get older , with many women penalised for taking short career breaks to have children			1
the @entity23 said a typical male management executive earns a basic salary of £ 40,325 , but a woman in the same job earns £ 30,265			0
while a typical man can scoop an average bonus of around £ 7,500 , his female colleague typically will receive only £ 3,730 , and the picture gets worse as women get older			2
after rising from a junior executive to a director half of all men receive a bonus , compared with little more than a third of women			2
over the last year , the report found that 4.3 per cent of female executives were made redundant , compared with only 3.2 per cent of male executives			0
@entity78 , a partner at accountants @entity79 , said : ‘ the size of the lifetime earnings gap between men and women is disturbing			0
‘ it suggests that women are going backwards versus their male counterparts			0
if the career path is identical , then it is hard to see why the differential would exist , let alone how it could be justified			0
‘ employers must really ask themselves whether they are being absolutely unbiased in the pay decisions they make			0
’ many working women are penalised after taking maternity leave			1
the penalties range from missing out on pay rises while at home with their babies to being taken less seriously on their return to work because they work flexibly			0
many women are penalised for taking short career breaks to have children many mothers who leave at 5pm every day , or take extra leave during the school holidays , say they feel less confident asking for pay rises or bonuses , or get overlooked for promotions			1
others also find it more difficult to move jobs after having children which means they do not get the pay rises that typically come with switching employers			2
professor @entity41 , from the @entity118 , said many women are also blighted by a lack of confidence			1
he said : ‘ men will ask for a promotion or a pay rise , which women are less likely to do			1
men will let everybody know about their success whereas women will not let anybody know , but will hope the boss will recognise when they make a contribution			0
’ as many women may leave earlier in the evening to get back for their children , many feel ‘ guilty ’ , which makes them reluctant to ask for a pay rise , he said			1
@entity139 , chief executive of the @entity23 , said @entity16 needs ‘ immediate ’ action to ‘ set things straight			2
’ she added : ‘ the government should demand more transparency from companies on pay , naming and shaming organisations that are perpetuating inequality			0
’ @entity148 mp , @entity149 ’s equalities spokesman , said : ‘ the gender pay gap at the management level is higher now than it was in 2010 , and at this rate , 42 years after the @entity152 was passed , it will take at least another 21 years for management level pay amongst men and women to be equalised			2
‘ this is simply not good enough			0
