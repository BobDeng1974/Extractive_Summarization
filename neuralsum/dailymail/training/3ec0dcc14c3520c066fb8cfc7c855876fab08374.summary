the trilby - a hat synonymous with celebrities @entity2 and @entity4 - is risky enough as a fashion statement			1
but now the headpiece has foiled an armed robbery , after a trilby - wearing gunman gave up on his heist when staff refused to take him seriously			1
the botched robbery began when the man entered a @entity14 , @entity15 , pharmacy shortly before closing time			1
he then pulls out a gun and points it at pharmacist @entity43 , 27			2
mr @entity43 said : ' he demanded money and i just told him simply he was n't going to get anything			0
' he looked completely dumbfounded and repeated the demand pointing the gun at me again			0
so i pushed it away and told him no. ' as the botched robbery was being played out only a few feet away customers and other pharmacists carried on their business completely oblivious to the scene unfolding beside them			0
customer @entity55 , 34 , said : ' i was vaguely aware of the man at the counter but was n't the slightest bit interested in what he wanted			2
' after he is unable to frighten mr @entity43 into handing over money , the frustrated crook walks over to the other pharmacist who also tells him to go away			2
after he is unable to get money from the first staff member , he next tries to threaten a second pharmacist , who simply tells him to go away the robber then gives up and wanders out of the store completely empty handed pharmacist @entity43 ( pictured ) said the man ' wanted to rob us and got more or less ignored ' unsure what to do , he stands in an aisle looking at the customers and pharmacists , before he finally gives up and walks out			1
mr @entity43 said : ' it was pretty bizarre really , both for us and i guess especially for him			0
he wanted to rob us and more or less got ignored			1
' although they clerks ' refusal to hand over money ended without incident , a police spokesman said the staff were lucky			0
he said : ' i think they were quite lucky and we urge anyone who sees someone with a gun to alert the police at the earliest opportunity , and not to [ deal with the situation ] themselves			0
