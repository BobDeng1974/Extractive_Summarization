the @entity0 will have to wait at least three seasons before video technology can be possibly be introduced			1
it is the @entity4 fa ( @entity3 ) who are leading the way in trials of a system to aid referees			1
however , their bid to introduce the technology in cup matches from next season was rejected by the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) last month			1
referees chief @entity16 has called for the arrival of video technology into the @entity0 given the increasing number of controversies in the @entity0 , referees ’ chief @entity16 has called for its arrival in the @entity25 top - flight			2
but the @entity15 have delayed any decision for 12 months at least , meaning the earliest we could see video assistance for referees will be the 2017/18 season			2
the @entity4 are certainly confident their process could work			0
it involves a fifth official located in a video room with access to instant replays			0
during @entity39 games they have been trialling how long it would take that official to make a correct judgment on key incidents only , such as red cards , penalties and fouls before goals			0
they have found that an average of two to three crucial decisions per game can each be resolved within five to 20 seconds , with the official having a direct audio link to the referee			0
should the @entity15 give the go - ahead for trials of this system – or another one – in competitive matches during the 2016/17 campaign , they would then want to see it used in a @entity61 age - grade tournament before giving permission for video technology to be implemented in the @entity0 and elsewhere around the world			1
with goal - line technology in use , and calls for videos to help with penalties and red cards too have risen too meanwhile , the notion of a ‘ challenge system ’ for managers has been rejected for fear of it being used for tactical gain			0
@entity3 chairman @entity76 will offer his full backing to any attempts to expand the use of video technology and will even volunteer @entity25 football to operate trials			1
‘ in 20 years we ’ll look back and say : “ was n’t it quaint that we did n’t use video technology ? ” ’ said @entity76			2
‘ when we discussed it at @entity15 , even the ones who were most against it accept it ’s going to happen			0
‘ if we ’re going to do it sometime , why do n’t we do it now ? we are 100 per cent behind it			0
i suspect we would like to do an experiment , but you ’d have to get that throu @entity3 chairman @entity76 has backed any attempts to expand the use of video technology in football			1
