@entity0 hailed @entity1 as the ' godfather of cricket ' following the former @entity5 captain and broadcaster 's death at the age of 84			1
@entity1 was as well known for his commentary as his cricket after moving into a career in the media in 1956 which saw him become the voice of the game in both @entity17 and his homeland			1
but he was also a trailblazing all - rounder who took 228 wickets and scored 2,201 runs in 68 tests while never losing a series in charge of his country			1
tributes are seen at the statue of @entity1 at the @entity29 after his passing aged 84 a tribute of a microphone with @entity1 's test cap number of 190 is left at the statue the flags atop the @entity36 can be seen flying at half - mast as a tribute to @entity1 the @entity40 flag at the @entity29 is lowered at half mast for the @entity40 cricketer and commentator one of @entity1 's most famous commentaries was on the ' ball of the century ' - @entity0 's first delivery in @entity48 cricket which dismissed @entity49 - and the 45 - year - old fellow leg - spinner paid an emotional tribute to his mentor on @entity53			1

i will cherish our entertaining dinners & all the fun times we shared over a long period of time			2

' @entity0 paid tribute to @entity1 , calling him the ' godfather of cricket ' current @entity95 captain @entity94 believes it was @entity1 's spirit as well as his prowess with bat , ball and microphone that made him one of the most popular figures in the game			1
' i think that everybody involved in the game of cricket : supporters , players , the media , everyone , @entity54 is known for a lot more than bowling a few leg - spinners and hitting a few cover drives , ' he told today on @entity113 in @entity5			1
' i think that 's probably why he 's such an idol to so many current cricketers because he 's been such a gentleman on the field , an amazing player and a lot of current players probably do n't realise what a good player he was			2
' but , what he 's done off the field , he 's an amazing example to a lots of sportsmen			2

' he loved winning and i think he helped the @entity40 team have that attitude that they wanted to win but he played the game the right way			2
' @entity1 took a break from commentary in 2013 after being involved in a car accident and just over a year later his comeback was put on ice as he began to receive treatment for skin cancer			1
@entity1 was one of cricket 's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge @entity1 was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in tests a floral tribute lies at a plaque at the @entity29 he never did return to the microphone full time but his legacy was long since secured and @entity5 coach @entity159 hailed him as ' one of the game 's greats '			1

when he was on air , we always had the tv volume turned up because his comments were so insightful			0
