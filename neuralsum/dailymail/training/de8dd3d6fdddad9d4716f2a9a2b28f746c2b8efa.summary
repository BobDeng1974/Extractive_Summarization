more than a quarter of a million @entity2 and @entity3 nationals now live in @entity4 – a figure that has risen by almost 50,000 over the past 12 months			1
the number based here has increased more than fivefold in eight years – making up the equivalent of a city the size of @entity11			1
the figures , which are published today by @entity14 ’s respected @entity13 , are based on analysis of the official @entity16			0
pictured : @entity2 catch a bus to @entity4 the data also shows that around one in five working - age migrants from @entity2 and @entity3 are not in work – a total of 46,000			1
arrivals from both countries have increased following the lifting of transitional border controls in january			2
@entity32 mp @entity31 , whose @entity34 constituency is in @entity35 , said the figures disproved the claims of those who said numbers would not increase sharply when the controls were abandoned			0
‘ it ’s quite clear that people were wrong , ’ he said			0
‘ the number one issue in my constituency is controlling immigration from the @entity47			2
‘ we have to get to grips with it			0
we have to act now and if that causes a row with the @entity47 then so be it			0
’ he called for an emergency brake on @entity47 numbers adding : ‘ it ’s putting pressure on the doctors ’ surgeries , the schools , the council services and housing			0
’ the @entity13 ’s analysis said migrant numbers from both countries had ‘ grown steadily ’ since the countries joined the @entity47 in 2007			2
arrivals from both @entity2 and @entity3 have increased following the lifting of transitional border controls in january the numbers align almost exactly with predictions from the @entity72 think - tank which suggested net migration from both countries would average around 50,000 a year			1
the figures show that in 2006 , in the year before @entity2 and @entity3 joined the @entity47 , the population of nationals from both countries living here stood at just 43,000			1
it barely changed the following year before steadily increasing , to 98,000 in 2009 , 132,000 in 2010 and 160,000 in 2012			0
the @entity81 had dismissed the idea that relaxing rules on migrants from @entity2 and @entity3 would lead to a surge in numbers in @entity4			1
most notably , @entity89 @entity88 , the business secretary , said the idea of thousands ‘ pouring off the planes ... was just a scare story ’			0
the @entity92 also downplayed the situation			0
in may , when it reported there were fewer workers from the two countries in the @entity4 in march than in january , political editor @entity94 scoffed : ‘ so much for those predictions of a flood of immigrants			2
’ in september of 2013 , the year before transitional controls were dropped , it stood at 205,000 but by the same point in 2014 it hit 252,000			0
this means the population from the two countries increased by 47,000 in the 12 months to september and is five times higher than it was eight years ago			1
the @entity13 said the not - in - work total of 46,000 will include a large number of students , spouses , dependants and those wealthy enough not to work			2
@entity115 , the observatory ’s director , said : ‘ immigration from @entity2 and @entity3 has been much more gradual than flows from the @entity47 member states that joined in 2004			1
‘ in 2004 , the @entity4 was one of only three @entity47 member states that did not introduce transitional labour market controls on migrants from new accession states , and saw a sharp increase in migration from these countries			1
‘ it seems likely that the controls imposed in 2007 , together with the weak economy at the end of the decade , may have slowed the pace of @entity2 and @entity3 migrants settling in the @entity4			1

more than a quarter of a million @entity2 and @entity3 now in @entity4
that number has risen by almost 50,000 over the past 12 months
@entity2 and @entity3 in @entity4 could fill a city size of @entity11
46,000 working - age migrants from the two countries do not have jobs
