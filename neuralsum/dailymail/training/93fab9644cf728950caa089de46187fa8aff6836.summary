computerised lorry convoys which are controlled by just one driver are set to be tested on @entity3 roads next year			1
the lorries would be electronically linked together , meaning the driver of the front vehicle could control the acceleration , braking and steering of the others			1
it would allow whole ‘ road trains ’ of lorries to travel long distances on motorways with only a few yards between each vehicle			2
it is a major step in an escalating race to develop self - driving vehicles , like those set to be introduced to @entity3 during the trial , trucker @entity26 was relaxing with his hands behind his head while at the wheel of his 40 - tonne heavy goods vehicle			1
similar technology is expected to be tested in @entity3 next year while the other lorries in the line would still have dedicated drivers , the automated system would allow them to ‘ switch off ’ for most of the journey			1
in an emergency , or at busy junctions , the drivers of the follow - on lorries would be able to retake control of their vehicles			1
backers of the proposal say the system would allow drivers to use their laptop , read a book or ‘ sit back and enjoy a relaxed lunch ’			0
they also say platoons would cut down on road congestion and cut fuel consumption by about 10 per cent			1
the fuel efficiency – and therefore lower running cost – of the lorry convoy is due to the reduced aerodynamic drag caused by its streamlined formation			1
but motoring organisations criticised the idea , warning the convoys may intimidate other drivers and block cars from entering and exiting motorways			1
tests are due to be held on tracks in @entity3 , and if successful could be extended to quieter motorways at night time			0
the ' road trains ' of lorries have been announced after it emerged last month that driverless cars , like the ones pictured , could be driving on @entity3 roads as of next year further trials would then be carried out on motorways which are heavily congested to test how well the automated system works in practice			1
the vehicles would communicate via wi - fi , so that if the lead vehicle changes speed , the others follow suit			2
in addition , the movements of the entire convoy would be monitored by laser sensors and infrared cameras			0
news of the @entity3 tests comes after @entity89 announced last month that it had run an autonomously driven truck on a closed section of the @entity93 autobahn			2
@entity95 lorry maker @entity94 has also been testing platoons on @entity95 roads since 2012			0
this latest plan , devised by the @entity99 , follows a trip by officials to @entity95 to study the system			0
their report concluded that similar trials in @entity3 would be feasible and ministers are expected to give the green light for them to start next year			0
earlier this month it was revealed that @entity109 has begun lobbying the state of @entity111 to allow it to test driverless motorbikes , like the one pictured , and trucks on its roads a government source told the @entity117 : ‘ there are potential benefits , notably reduced costs for haulage firms and reduced congestion for motorists , so there is sense in looking into it			2
‘ equally we have to be cautious and ensure that safety is n’t compromised in any way			0
’ @entity130 , head of roads and transport policy at the @entity134 , said : ‘ it ’s a complicated one and road users will naturally have concerns about it			1
‘ if the lorries are following each other closely , it might be hard to spot the road signs on the near side of the motorway			2
‘ putting it into practice would mean a complete re-design of the signage system			0
‘ it would also make exit and entry very difficult on motorways , so the convoys would have to separate at every junction			0
‘ these ideas always need to be looked at , but at this stage i can see some pitfalls			0
‘ motorways are the safest roads we have , and we would n’t want to do anything to jeopardise that			0

technology allows convoy *'s* 10 other lorry drivers to relax while on road
*supporters* of the plan say it cuts fuel consumption and eases congestion
motoring organisations warn they could intimidate other road users
plans follow *demonstration* of self - driving lorries in @entity93 last month
