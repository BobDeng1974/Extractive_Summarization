mr @entity8 said he underwent a voluntary drugs test to prove he was not high at the time			1

' there was no mistaking the crocodile and i am still convinced that is what i saw			2
' i know there are some people who do n’t believe that there was a crocodile in the @entity54 but i know what i saw			0
' you could see the sections of its back sticking out of the water			0
' the river was very high that day which meant that it was deep enough for the crocodile to swim in the middle of the river			1
@entity66 and @entity68 chief constable @entity67 wrote on @entity69 that officers ' ca n't find it ' after mr @entity8 reported the ' sighting ' the six - foot reptile was reportedly seen lurking in the river which is around 500ft away from a nursery and 1,000ft away from a secondary school ' i had plenty of time so i got a really good look at it and it looked like a crocodile to me			1
' mr @entity8 first spotted the creature under @entity30 , in @entity6 , at around 9.05am at the beginning of february			1

' he said there were around four or five passengers on the bus at the time but they were all listening to devices and he could not get out of his seat to attract their attention			0
he added : ' i had to wait until i could stop the bus and then i managed to get the attention of a female police officer			0

' i knew people would take the mickey out of me but i would do the same thing again if i had to			0
' i am not sure how the crocodile got there but the reason i told the police is that i thought it could be a danger to the public			2
' the suspected crocodile floating on the @entity54 , from footage captured by a councillor on a walk the councillor that filmed the footage believes that the object must be the infamous reptile because it has was moving against the river 's current officers quickly established that @entity129 , which is two miles away from where the ‘ croc ’ was spotted , was not missing any animals			1
just a day later , officers - in full riot gear - launched a second hunt after another sighting was reported in @entity136 across the city - but this turned out to be a hoax			2
a second sighting of the alleged crocodile came a week later from mother - of - three @entity144 , 41 , of @entity145 , who said she saw the beast as she drove past the entrance to @entity148			2
@entity149 , 39 , captured the object floating against the current below some birds , before it apparently bobbed and turning around			0
he says that the object is not a log , believing that it is the same crocodile that has been spotted twice last week			0
