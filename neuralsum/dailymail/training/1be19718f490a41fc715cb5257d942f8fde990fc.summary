remains : pictured is a cast of dr @entity9 's damaged bone after he had been attacked by a lion the famous meeting of @entity223 in @entity17 , 1871 it has gone down in history as one of the most memorable greetings of all time			1
' @entity9 , i presume ' , said @entity16 after months of searching the @entity17 bush for the long - lost explorer			1
@entity16 made great capital out of his remark on 19th - century lecture tours , and it helped to make him a major celebrity			0
but he probably never said it at all , according to biographer @entity236			0
in his 2007 book , @entity16 : the impossible life of @entity17 's @entity239 , @entity236 says @entity16 invented the phrase to help define his image as the archetypal reserved , stiff - upper - lipped @entity244 explorer			2
' @entity16 told lies , that is the problem , ' said @entity236			0
' and a liar can never subsequently tell the truth			0
' the son of a @entity158 prostitute , @entity16 re-invented himself several times , becoming first a newspaper correspondent in @entity159 , then an adventurer and explorer of the @entity17 continent before finally becoming a politician			0
it was while working for the @entity43 that he was asked to find the @entity4 missionary explorer @entity9 , who had been missing for five years			1
@entity16 succeeded in locating him in 1871 , in what is today @entity175 , to land one of the greatest scoops of the century			0
but his diary does not mention the greeting			0
it refers only to ' a pale - looking white man in a faded blue cap '			0
more tellingly , the next two pages have been ripped from the book			0
@entity236 asked : ' why else did he tear up those pages ? ' the author insisted he was not out to rubbish the reputation of @entity16 and maintained he was a great man			0
' he was our greatest land explorer and i can say that as i am @entity9 's biographer too , ' he added			1
@entity236 revealed that @entity16 had always been impressed by the tight - lipped englishness of army officers , and he particularly loved an anecdote about two @entity244 gentlemen who had passed each other in the wilds of @entity282 and merely lifted their caps to each other			0
as a result he invented the famous phrase about his meeting with @entity9 , having asked himself the question : ' what would a gent have said ? ' the phrase first appeared in the @entity43 in 1872 , and @entity16 subsequently repeated it many times			2
a handwritten manuscript of a lecture was sold at @entity293 in 1999 and gave a standard version of events : ' doubtful of the temper he would receive me , ' wrote @entity16 , ' i simply bowed and said , " @entity9 , i presume ? " ' he held out his hand in token of kindly welcome and in a few minutes we became warm friends			2
