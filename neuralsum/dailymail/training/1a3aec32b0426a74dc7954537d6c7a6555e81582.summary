by @entity0 published : 09:13 est , 8 march 2014 updated : 03:07 est , 11 march 2014 a neuroscientist has claimed the expression ' men are from @entity5 and women are from @entity7 ' has no scientific grounding , and that instead our brains are changed by the roles society forces us to play			1
according to @entity12 , a professor at @entity13 in @entity14 , stereotypes - such as women 's supposed inability to read maps , or the idea men are bad at multitasking - have no links to science			1
instead of being wired in different ways , professor @entity12 said that men and women are only dissimilar because the world we live in encourages gender role - playing			1
neuroscientist @entity12 , a professor at @entity29 , said this week that she believes gender differences are caused by society stereotypes			1
she said that gender differences have no scientific grounding speaking earlier this week , she said the differences between men and women are caused by the ' drip , drip , drip ' of gender stereotypes			1
she said : ' you ca n't pick up a brain and say " that 's a girl 's brain , or that 's a boy 's brain " in the same way you can with the skeleton			0
' there is pretty compelling evidence that any differences are tiny and are the result of environment not biology			0
' the @entity53 reported that @entity54 said that she disagreed with gender stereotypes instilled in children from a young age			2
the fact that boys and girls are given different toys based on their sex is what creates gender differences within the brain , she said			2
by playing with a @entity68 rather than a train , for example , a girl 's brain is programmed to become more feminine			0
professor @entity12 also said that more emphasis should be placed on the fact that the brain is in fact a muscle - and can therefore be exercised according to what it is required to do			1
so for example spending a long time mutitasking , would cause the relevant section of a woman 's brain would to develop			0
a woman 's brain would therefore become wired to multitask because of the role that she is expected to play , she said			0
giving children different toys according to their sex , such a @entity87 for a boy and a @entity68 for a girl , creates gender differences within the brain , the professor from @entity29 argued professor @entity12 's comments clash with @entity93 studies completed in december last year which highlighted differences in the way the brains of men and women are wired			1
researchers from the @entity100 scanned the brains of 1,000 men , women , boys and girls			0
through the analysis , experts found that the male brain is wired from front to back whereas the female brain is crisscrossed from left to right			2
in a piece in the journal @entity112 the researchers said that the differences in wiring could explain why men tend to be better at performing one task such as cycling whereas woman are more equipped for mutlitasking			0
on @entity120 today , prof @entity12 will be speaking at the @entity122 festival , held at the @entity123 in @entity124			0
prof @entity12 's comments clash with @entity93 studies completed in december last year which highlighted differences in the way the brains ' of men and women are wired			1
researchers from the @entity100 scanned the brains of 1,000 men , women , girls and boys			0

neuroscience expert @entity12 said there is no scientific evidence to prove male and female brains are wired differently
giving children gender - *specific* toys ' changes the way our brains are wired '
she thinks women are better at multitasking as society requires them to be
