by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 16:58 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 03:04 est , 13 january 2014 the polygamous family that stars in the @entity7 reality tv show ' @entity8 ' said they felt humbled and were brought to tears when they learned a federal judge in @entity13 has struck down key parts of the state 's polygamy laws			1
the judge ruled in mid-december in favor of a lawsuit brought against @entity13 in july 2011 by @entity8 and his four wives after they fled the state for @entity22 under the threat of prosecution			1
' the first thing i thought about was all those families that for 100 years had lived and loved in obscurity , just in secrecy , ' said @entity8 in a phone interview with the @entity0 from @entity22			1
' not being able to claim their family or openly love one another			0
' humbled : the stars of the @entity7 reality tv show ' @entity8 , ' pictured , said they were humbled when a federal judge in @entity13 struck down key parts of the state 's polygamy laws last month @entity8 and his wives — @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 — said they hope the landmark ruling stands and enables other polygamous families in @entity13 to live open and free without fearing prosecution			1
' it 's been incredible not having to live in fear anymore and being able to fully claim who we are , ' said @entity53 , @entity8 's third wife			1
' we wish that for every plural family out there			0
' the @entity13 attorney general 's office has not yet decided if they will appeal the ruling , said spokesman @entity59			1
the state 's new attorney general , @entity61 , has been in office for less than two @entity64 , the @entity65 ' @entity66 - based attorney , said he 's been told @entity13 will appeal			1
he said he 's eager to defend the ruling before the 10th @entity68 @entity67			2
@entity68 district judge @entity69 said in the decision handed down on december 13 that a provision in @entity13 's bigamy law forbidding cohabitation with another person violated the @entity75 , which guarantees the freedom of religion			1
the ruling decriminalizes polygamy , but bigamy — holding marriage licenses with multiple partners — is still illegal			0
@entity13 's law was considered stricter than the laws in 49 other states because of the cohabitation clause			1
if the ruling stands , @entity13 's law would be identical to most other states that prohibit people from having multiple marriage licenses			1
legal battle : @entity8 and his wives - @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 - brought the lawsuit against @entity13 in july 2011 after they fled the state for @entity22 under the threat of prosecution in most polygamous families in @entity13 , the man is legally married to one woman but only ' spiritually married ' to the others			1
there are an estimated 38,000 fundamentalist @entity99 who practice or believe in polygamy , most living in @entity13 and other @entity104 states			2
polygamy is a legacy of the early teachings of the @entity99 church but has no place in modern @entity111 , church officials said in a statement			0
the @entity114 - based @entity113 abandoned polygamy in 1890 and it strictly prohibits the practice today for its 15 million members worldwide			0
though some have correlated the @entity65 fight to decriminalize polygamy with efforts to legalize gay marriage , the @entity65 do n't see the two as being the same			0
bad reputation : one of the most infamous polygamists , @entity122 , pictured , is serving a life sentence in @entity125 for sexually assaulting two underage girls he considered his brides ' though we support the choices of other people organizing their families however they choose , our argument has always been very different , ' @entity8 said			2
' what we 've been looking for is simply to live free and to be able to live our religion without the threat of prosecution			2
' the family says they never intended to challenge @entity13 's polygamy law in court when they decided to do the show			1
@entity143 , @entity8 's second wife , said they wanted to dispel the negative stereotype of polygamous families			1
' we were tired of @entity122 being the only image people had of polygamy , ' she said			0
one of the most infamous polygamists , @entity122 , is serving a life sentence in @entity125 for sexually assaulting two underage girls he considered his brides			0
@entity122 still rules a sect of fundamentalist @entity99 on the @entity13 - @entity153 border from jail			2
the @entity65 are now living in four new houses in a @entity22 cul - de - sac			2
that 's where @entity7 films episodes of the hit show , which debuted in 2010 with footage of the family at their house in northern @entity13			1
but despite an arrangement that looks comfortable to many , @entity8 said they miss living in the large house they called home in @entity13			1
in fact , they miss @entity13 dearly			0
they said leaving the state they still consider home has left many scars for them and their children			0
they fled in january 2011 after local prosecutors opened a criminal bigamy investigation after the first episodes aired			0
they left jobs , a home designed especially for their large family and a culture they knew well			0
the hardest part about living in @entity22 , they said , is not being able to worship with their fellow fundamentalist mormons who practice or believe in polygamy			2
they hold worship services at home			0
' we are doing the best we can in our exile , ' @entity8 said			0
they hope to someday return home to @entity13 , but said they are n't considering that move yet			2
that could be the topic of a future family meeting where decisions are n't easy to reach with five heads of the households and 17 children , several who are young adults and want in on the discussion			0
how do they manage to keep everyone happy with the decisions ? ' we do a lot of praying , ' said @entity8 , ' and a lot of negotiation			0

@entity8 and his four wives who star in the @entity7 reality tv show said they felt humbled and cried when they heard the mid-december ruling
the judge found in their favor in a lawsuit they brought against @entity13 in july 2011 after they fled the state for @entity22 under the threat of prosecution
the state 's authorities caught wind of their polygamy after they appeared on the show ' @entity8 ' in 2010
@entity8 and his wives - @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 - said they hope the landmark ruling stands and enables other polygamous families to live freely in @entity13
