for more than a month , @entity2 's @entity1 volcano has been steadily spewing lava into the air , covering the region in a blanket of ash			1
and while most people are being advised to stay away , a film director and photographer have not only travelled as close to the heart of the eruption as they could , they 've managed to capture its volcanic activity in stunning high - definition			2
using a drone , fitted with a @entity21 action camera , the pair were able to record footage in the centre of the area ’s @entity25 lava field , and provide an incredible view of its violent and blistering core			1
it was captured by @entity36 , director of aerial imaging for drone - maker dji , alongside photographer @entity39 on 20 september weight : 2.2lbs ( 1.03kg ) @entity41 : 35 ° flight time : 25mins communication distance : 3,280ft ( 1,000 metres ) @entity44 : $ 1,190 ( £ 750 ) @entity1 is a large central volcano lying underneath @entity2 's @entity47 glacier , in the centre of the country			1
it contains a 2,296ft - deep ( 700 metre ) caldera , hidden beneath ice , covered in extensive flank fissures , from where the majority eruptions take place			0
the most recent eruption began in august , and experts believe it could last for up to a year			2
the @entity60 fissure extends for over 62 miles ( 100km ) to the south west , almost reaching @entity63 volcano			0
while the @entity65 fissure extends 31 ( 50km ) to the north east , towards the @entity68 volcano			0
it was in this latter region that the footage was filmed			0
@entity36 , director of aerial imaging for drone - maker dji , alongside photographer @entity39 travelled to the region on 20 september , reports @entity75			1
they drove as close as they could , before having to complete the rest of the journey on foot , armed with gas masks and hiking boots			2
@entity36 , director of aerial imaging for drone - maker dji , alongside photographer @entity39 travelled to the region ( pictured ) on 20 september			1
the pair drove as close as they could , before having to complete the rest of the journey on foot , armed with gas masks and hiking boots once the pair established a safe place to stand , they flew the @entity94 ( pictured left ) fitted with a @entity96 camera ( pictured right ) over the fissure			1
mr @entity36 piloted the drone using a wireless video transmission system to plot the route and capture the footage once the pair established a spot that was close enough to reach using the drone , but safe enough to stand , they flew the @entity94 quadcopter fitted with a @entity96 camera over the fissure			1
mr @entity36 piloted the drone using a wireless video transmission system to plot the route and capture the footage			1
the morning after the footage was taken , the area was flooded with lava			0
it took the researcher three attempts to fly the drone ( pictured ) close enough to the eruption			2
the first two attempts failed because the film crew was stood too far away , and the drone kept returning because they were trying to fly it out of range the $ 1,199 ( £ 750 ) drone is fitted with sensors that are designed to return it to its launch position if it flies out of range of the pilot			0
it has a @entity132 communication distance of up to 3,280ft ( 1,000 metres ) , and flies for 25 minutes on a single charge the $ 1,199 ( £ 750 ) drone is fitted with sensors that are designed to return it to its launch position if the drone flies out of range of its pilot			0

when the drone returned to mr @entity36 , the front of the @entity21 had melted but the memory card inside had been protected			1

when the drone returned to mr @entity36 , the front of the @entity21 had melted but the memory card inside had been protected , meaning the footage ( pictured ) was intact @entity1 is a large central volcano lying underneath @entity2 's @entity47 glacier , in the centre of the country ( pictured )			1

the footage was shot using a dji *phantom* 2 quadcopter drone fitted with a @entity96 action camera
it was captured by @entity36 , director of aerial imaging for @entity173 , and photographer @entity39
the eruption began in august and the footage was recorded in the @entity1 region of @entity2 on 20 september
mr @entity36 and mr @entity39 got as close to the eruption as they could by *walking* in boots and gas masks
the @entity21 camera did *n’t* survive the trip *–* but its memory card did and the footage was recorded wirelessly
