by @entity0 published : 19:42 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 06:10 est , 19 august 2013 @entity2 veteran @entity1 has revealed he nearly lost his leg after breaking it in a fall and contracting a severe infection in the injury			1
the 70 - year - old spent nearly seven months in hospital being treated with antibiotics and undergoing nine operations - none of which managed to shift the bacteria			1
after treatment failed , doctors threatened to amputate his leg but he begged them to find an alternative			1
@entity1 ( far left ) revealed that he nearly lost his leg when it became infected following a fall			1
he has been a regular host on the @entity2 for 36 years			2
they decided to carry out plastic surgery to cut infected flesh and bone from his right ankle and fill the space with a ‘ steak ’ taken from his left thigh			2
now finally back on his feet , mr @entity1 will make his first appearance on the @entity2 in over a year this sunday – and has revealed he made history as the first person to appear on the programme barefoot			1
‘ i ’m much happier without shoes and socks on , ’ he said			0
‘ the infection is gone now but i ’m still getting quite a bit of pain , sometimes a lot of pain			0
i try to keep ( my leg ) up as much as possible			2
’ mr @entity1 , who has been a regular feature on the show for 36 years , shattered the bones in his lower leg when he slipped on wet grass in april last year			1
surgeons drilled into his leg to fit a metal ‘ scaffold ’ to hold the broken bones in place			0
but within days bacteria had got in through one of the drill holes and caused an infection			0
mr @entity1 said he had considered leaving the popular @entity53 programme but that he is excited to return for another series			1
mr @entity1 was told by a nurse to go to @entity56 at the @entity57 in @entity58 , where a registrar he described as ‘ completely idiotic ’ told him the weeping from his wound meant it was ‘ getting better ’ and sent him home			1
he returned twice in the following week only to be sent home each time - and was only admitted on his fourth visit			0
he said : ‘ i ’m not a medical expert , but if they had seen it earlier perhaps i would have been ok			0
’ describing the months of treatment he had in hospital , he said : ‘ they were pumping me full of antibiotics			0
‘ in the end they tried to inject it every two hours day and night for a month			0
i was dog tired all the time			0
’ at the end of november he was taken to the @entity77 in @entity78 where surgeons performed the operation which saved his leg , although he still has to take ‘ handfuls of pills ’ to keep the infection at bay			0
amazing , mr @entity1 can now drive and walk again , although he feels tired most of the time because he sleeps badly due to the pain in both legs			1
he said he was ‘ amazed ’ he had ended up which so many complications from a slip ‘ where most people would just fall down and go “ @entity92 ”			2
’ ‘ it was so silly , ’ he added , ‘ i had just got out of the car to stretch my legs and slipped on a patch of wet grass			0
’ he said he had considered quitting the @entity2 but is thrilled to be back – although he is limiting his involvement to filming locations near his @entity102 home			2
‘ i was worried all the morphine had aged me and affected my memory , but it does n’t seem to be a problem , ’ he said			0
mr @entity1 has written to the @entity57 with ‘ suggestions ’ for how it could improve , but said he had not heard anything save for one phone call from ‘ a woman in the complaints department who clearly did n’t want to talk to me			1
’ the first episode of the new series of the @entity2 is on @entity115 at 8pm on sunday .			1

70 year - old told of how doctors wanted to amputate leg after it became severely infected
