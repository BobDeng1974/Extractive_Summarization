scientists have finally solved a visual illusion first discovered by @entity2 over 400 years ago			1
he was perplexed to find @entity4 looked bigger than @entity5 with the naked eye - but not through a telescope			1
now , researchers say the effect is an optical illusion that occurs because of the way our eyes see lightness and darkness in the world			0
@entity2 was perplexed to find @entity4 ( left ) looked bigger than @entity5 with the naked eye - but not through a telescope			1
now researchers claim to have discovered why the edges of a light object appear blurred and this is effectively magnified by the brain so that the entire object appears bigger than it should			0
@entity4 , being nearer to @entity24 , is brighter than @entity5 and so it appears bigger against the dark background of the night sky			0
their results advance our understanding of how our brains are wired for seeing white versus black objects			2
the work was done by @entity35 and collaborators in the laboratories of @entity38 and @entity39 at the @entity40 , and will be published on february 10 of 2014 in the @entity41 ' @entity2 was the first to say that our eye was distorting reality , ' dr @entity38 said			1
' he could see that @entity4 appeared to be much larger than @entity5 when seen with the naked eye and that the opposite was true when he looked through his telescope , ' @entity2 said that the effect was some kind of size illusion created by the eyes			1
' either because their light is refracted in the moisture that cover the pupil , or because it is reflected from the edges of the eyelids and these reflected rays are diffused over the pupil , or for some other reasons , ' @entity2 wrote			2
the 19 century @entity61 physicist @entity60 came nearer to the truth when he said that the ' irradiation illusion ' , as he called it , was caused by our sensation of the object and not by the optics of the eye			0
' the latest research demonstrates that the sensation @entity60 used to explain the irradiation illusion is a ‘ non-linear ’ response of the visual system when objects are presented on dark backgrounds , ' dr @entity38 explained			0
the phenomenon is related to the way we see black and white - and also explains why we find black text on a white page easier to read @entity2 was puzzled by the fact that he appearance of the planets hanged depending on whether one looked with the naked eye versus with a telescope			1
viewed directly , planets seemed ' expanded ' and had ' a radiant crown ' , which made @entity4 looked eight to ten times larger than @entity5 even if @entity5 was four times larger			2
though @entity2 realized this size illusion was not created by the object — but by his eyes — he did not understand why or how			2
he wrote , ' either because their light is refracted in the moisture that covers the pupil , or because it is reflected from the edges of the eyelids and these reflected rays are diffused over the pupil , or for some other reason			0
" generations of scientists following @entity2 continued to assume the illusion was caused by blur or similar optical effects			2
however , though blur can distort size , it does not explain why @entity4 looks larger than @entity5 with the naked eye			1
@entity60 — the venerable 19th century @entity61 physician - physicist — was the first to realize that something else " was needed to explain the illusion , as he described in his treatise on @entity114			0
in this photo , the planet @entity5 is visible as a bright dot on the upper left , with @entity4 the brightest planet in the center of the frame and the cresent moon is behind the cloud			0
scientists have now discovered why @entity4 looks bigger than @entity5 the researchers say the results also show why we prefer black text on a white background only now , with @entity35 and colleagues ' new study , has science finally zoomed in and illuminated the scope of the problem			1
it 's a feature of how we see everything , no less			0
in the new study , @entity38 and his colleagues used electrodes to record the electrical signals from neurons in the visual areas of anesthetized cats , monkeys and human brains while the researchers showed the animal and human participants dark shapes on a light background , light shapes on a dark background , or light or dark shapes on a gray background			0
so white spots on a black background look bigger than same - sized black spots on white background , and @entity2 's glowing moons are not really as big as they might appear to the unaided eye			1
this effect is responsible for how we see everything from textures and faces — based on their dark parts in bright daylight — to why it is easier to read this very page with black - on - white lettering , rather than white - on - black ( a well known , and until now , unexplained phenomenon )			1
by tracing these effects as a function of the way neurons are laid out and interconnected in the retina and brain , the authors found that the illusion is potentially derived from the very origin of vision — in the photoreceptors of the eye themselves .			0

*experts* say key is the way our eye processes black and white
also explains why we prefer reading black on white text
