but @entity14 architect @entity13 has positioned himself at the other end of the spectrum - by creating a home that is so narrow there is not even room for a staircase			1

slimmed down : front and back views of the house in @entity22 which has no windows			1
@entity41 comes through two holes in the bedroom wall so you can tell when it is day time technical challenge : the framework for the house was constructed off - site and slotted into place by a team of builders because there is only a total floor space of 46 square feet in the two - floor iron structure , residents have to use a ladder to go up a level			1

inviting friends for dinner is not really on the cards			0
there are only two fixed seats at the dinner table			0
that sticks out of the wall			1

it is functional though , featuring a tiny bed and desk			2
books can be stored in an alcove behind the bed			2
' research shows we are approaching a social disaster because too little living space is built , ' the architect said			0
' you do n't need that much space to live in , so it is worth considering building smaller scaled , cheaper housing			2
' when @entity60 moves out of the property he will give it to a colleague			1
one of the buildings next to the house dates from before the war while the other was built after it			0
before the @entity133 most of @entity22 's architecture was brick based			0
but with the city almost completely destroyed by @entity136 , the communist rulers of @entity14 rebuilt the city in concrete			0
