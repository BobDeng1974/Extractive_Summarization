by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:40 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 04:53 est , 18 october 2013 pregnant : equalities minister @entity3 is due to give birth on @entity5 it is seen as one of the cradles of democracy			1
but as one mother - to - be found out , the @entity10 is no hotbed of chivalry yet while the incident led to a stream of protests on @entity17 and was condemned by some @entity19 mps who had been sitting at the other end of the chamber , miss @entity3 could not see what the fuss was about			0
@entity24 made clear that giving up a seat for a pregnant woman was the ' decent thing ' to do			1
but miss @entity3 believes it was ‘ quite sexist ’ to suggest she was not capable of standing			1
the incident reignited the debate about whether people should offer their seat to pregnant women , and whether expectant mothers should assume they would			0
miss @entity3 champions women ’s rights in government and has called for a change in attitudes to new parents			1
but onlookers were alarmed to see the 33 - year - old standing during throughout @entity43 yesterday , while @entity45 , @entity19 and @entity46 backbenchers sat nearby			1
as @entity24 took questions in the commons at midday every seat was taken , leaving a large group of mps standing by the main doors			1
miss @entity3 , who is due to give birth on christmas day , was among them			0
but none of the mps sitting just feet away offered her a seat – to the surprise of @entity60 observers			0
@entity61 , political editor of @entity62 , wrote on @entity17 : ‘ quite remarkable that no mp has offered @entity3 , who is seven months pregnant , a seat			2
' really shocking lack of manners and decency			0
’ however aides to @entity69 claimed the idea that she was not capable of standing was ' sexist '			1
a source close to the minister said : ‘ the suggestion somehow that people should be outraged on her behalf is ridiculous			1
the idea that just because she is seven months pregnant she has lost all ability to stand on her two feet or fend for herself is quite sexist			0
' she did not think it was an issue			0
if she had wanted to sit down she would have asked to sit			0
she is quite capable of fulfilling her functions as a minister – including standing and walking – while she is pregnant			1
she is not somehow severely incapacitated			0
’ however mr @entity24 's official spokesman insisted the prime minister thought anyone should give up their seat for a pregnant woman			1
' take the example of public transport - i think if you see someone who is in greater need of a seat than yourself i think offering that seat is a good thing to do ... a decent thing to do , ' the spokesman said			2
asked if mr @entity24 would offer his seat to a pregnant woman if he was on a bus , the spokesman said : ' i 'm sure he would			1
' pressed on whether that would be a sexist thing to do , the spokesman said : ' offering one 's seat to someone who is in greater need than oneself on public transport ? i think that 's a very understandable thing to do			2
' standing room only : none of the mps who had secured a seat for prime minister 's questions gave up their place for @entity69 ( circled ) the issue of whether to offer up a seat to a pregnant woman has become increasingly vexed			1
in one camp are those that argue expectant mothers are more likely to be tired - they are carrying around another person after all - and will appreciate the option of sitting down			0
but critics say the idea that a pregnant woman can not stand up on a train or a bus is sexist and patronising			0
last year mother - to - be @entity136 hit out at ' barbaric ' passengers on a packed @entity139 tram who refused to give up their tram seat - even though she is eight months ' pregnant and needs crutches to walk			1
when @entity142 , five months pregnant , was presented with a ' @entity143 ' in march last year she joked she would ' wear it at home '			0
the source close to @entity69 said the minister did not want to ‘ give a running commentary ’ on whether she had been offered or accepted seats in other circumstances , such as on public transport			1
‘ sometimes she ’s in the middle of a carriage surrounded by people who are also standing so other passengers may not see her , ’ the source added			1
‘ she does not necessarily feel aggrieved about that			0
’ miss @entity3 is a junior business minister working with @entity158 , and has pushed for greater equality for women at work			2
she has admitted the pressure of carrying a baby was taking its toll on being a minister in the government and @entity46 mp for @entity168			1
however the source resented the idea that @entity69 has been made to like ' some sort of victim '			0
' she arrived ten minutes late for @entity43 , and that ’s why she was standing right at the back , ’ the source said			1
‘ she was n’t visible to the majority of mps who had their backs to her			0
she also knew she had to leave early because she had another event to go to			0
‘ she was standing talking to a colleague , and she was perfectly happy standing			2
she was perfectly happy being where she was and did not feel the need to have a seat			0
if she needed to have a seat , or had felt she wanted to have one , she would have been perfectly capable of asking			2
once tipped as a future @entity186 secretary , she admitted she will not be able to lead the charge in next year ’s independent referendum			0
‘ clearly , there will be a period when i wo n’t be able to be quite as active on the doorsteps , ’ she told the @entity189 on sunday last month			2
‘ but , yes , i want to be strongly involved in that campaign because i believe it ’s so important for the future of @entity186 and , indeed , for the future of the @entity197			0
’ she is also adamant that she will not take ministerial red boxes while on maternity leave			1
‘ i am still very committed and enjoy my job and want to come back to continue doing that , but i think having a bit of time to do that early bonding is also really important			0
’ government : miss @entity3 is a close ally of deputy prime minister @entity207 and has been tipped for the @entity208 the coalition has agreed new rules allowing new parents work alternate months for up to a year under moves to tear up ‘ old - fashioned and rigid ’ workplace rules			1
mums and dads will be able to ‘ mix and match ’ how they look after a newborn baby for their first year			2
they will be able to take up a total of 52 weeks in joint leave , either taking it in turns or at the same time			2
ministers hope the changes will encourage fathers to play a bigger role in raising their child while mothers are able to return to work at a time of their choosing			0
miss @entity3 said she had discussed with her husband @entity231 , who is also a @entity46 mp , about how to ‘ share the parenting as much as possible ’			1
