a former @entity1 detective was today ordered to pay nearly £ 360,000 to @entity2 and @entity3 after a long - running libel trial			0
@entity5 had been on trial over claims he made in a book and a documentary that the couple were involved in their daughter @entity11 's disappearance			1
in a written verdict , a @entity14 court agreed that @entity5 should pay @entity16 and mrs @entity3 € 250,000 ( £ 179,000 ) each in damages and banned further sales of his book @entity21			1
the couple 's lawyer @entity22 also revealed that @entity5 had been told to pay interest which she said stood at present at € 106,000 ( £ 76,000 )			1
mr @entity5 , who led the initial investigation into @entity11 's disappearance , released his book three days after the case was closed in 2008			1
he later took part in a documentary for @entity1 television in which he claimed that @entity11 was dead , that there had been no abduction and the @entity50 had hidden her body			2
the couple , who accuse @entity5 of hampering the search for their daughter , had been expected to receive around £ 1million in damages			1
@entity5 's lawyers have leave to appeal the ruling			2
the @entity50 told the court last summer they were left ' devastated and crushed ' by his book , which sold around 120,000 copies before it was withdrawn when the couple won an injunction against the ex-police chief			1
mrs @entity62 , 47 , said @entity11 's twin siblings @entity63 and @entity64 , now ten , knew mr @entity5 had written a book but did n't know the detail			1
@entity5 claimed @entity11 ( above ) had not been abducted , but had died in an accident in @entity38 she told the court last july after applying to make a statement : ' i believe that 's what 's in mr @entity5 's book and the documentary is very distressing to adults			1
' to a child , it could be very damaging			0
' asked by the judge how she felt after reading the book , she said : ' i was devastated			2
' it made me feel quite desperate because of the injustice i felt towards my daughter and our family as a whole			2
' it was very painful to read and i felt sad for @entity11			0
i also felt anxious and fearful because of the damage i felt it was doing in @entity1			0
' she went on to accuse @entity5 , thrown off the investigation in 2007 for criticising @entity92 police , of ' consistently smearing ' them			1
she also claimed they feared the book may have stopped people coming forward with information about their daughter 's whereabouts			1
a team of 31 @entity92 detectives are working exclusively to find the girl			0
mystery : @entity92 police shift through soil on an area of wasteland during a search for @entity35 in @entity38 , @entity1 , in june last year during their investigation into her disappearance the @entity110 was tasked with investigating the disappearance after her family made a personal plea to @entity115 in 2011			2
since @entity11 vanished , every possible theory has been explored , including that she was kidnapped by a paedophile or killed during a botched burglary			0
others include being snatched by traffickers and sold to a childless couple and that she wandered out of the apartment and died in a tragic accident			0
however , not one shred of proof of what happened to @entity11 has been uncovered			0
detective chief inspector @entity127 , who took over @entity128 in december , and her team travelled to @entity1 to interview seven suspects and four witnesses , but have not released any information about what they discovered			0
@entity1 prosecutors also reopened their probe into @entity11 's disappearance last year and are conducting a separate investigation to one led by @entity139 .			0

@entity144 told court they were left ' devastated and crushed ' by *allegations*
