by @entity0 published : 18:49 est , 17 february 2013 updated : 06:04 est , 18 february 2013 hounded out : @entity1 said he told sir @entity2 that @entity3 was being put under ' huge pressure ' to meet non-urgent targets a whistleblower wrote to the head of the @entity8 to warn his trust was ‘ slipping into @entity11 territory ’			1
@entity1 told sir @entity2 that @entity3 was being put under ‘ huge pressure ’ to meet non-urgent targets			1
he said patient safety was being compromised as it had been in @entity14 where 1,200 lives are thought to have been lost needlessly			1
but the 63 - year - old was hounded out of his job as chairman just like @entity19 , the trust ’s former chief executive , who risked a £ 500,000 pay - off to break a gagging order last week			1
mr @entity19 exposed the way in which meeting targets was prioritised over patient care and called for sir @entity1 ’s resignation for failing to intervene			1
the most powerful man in the @entity8 is already under pressure to quit over his role in the @entity11 scandal			0
on friday , health secretary @entity31 attacked ‘ institutional self - preservation ’ in the @entity36 while grieving families marched on @entity33 to call for sir @entity1 ’s resignation			2
last night , mr @entity1 demanded sir @entity1 be held to account for his role in ‘ ignoring ’ an imminent scandal at his trust , which is now under investigation over the deaths of 670 patients			2
in his letter of july 2009 to sir @entity1 , mr @entity1 claims he was put under huge pressure to guarantee that the trust would meet its waiting - list targets ‘ regardless of demand or any other factors ’			1
he claimed staff at the strategic health authority ‘ resorted to harassment and bullying ’ and ‘ demanded without caveat ... an unequivocal assurance or guarantee the non-emergency 18 - week targets will be met in a manner which could be construed as an attempt to bully me and my trust into becoming a @entity11 and so put patient safety at risk ’			1
sir @entity1 responded to letters from mr @entity1 , mr @entity19 and the trust ’s board with a ‘ sham review ’ which failed to look into patient safety , the whistleblower claimed			1
he added : ‘ i am qualified to say that having carried out my own analysis into the culture in other trusts			0
it did n’t touch on the safety issues			0
it did n’t touch on the issue of the breaches of the code around over-full hospitals			0
’ the father of two also claims he was ordered to sack mr @entity19 , but refused and was forced out of his job			2
he was not made to sign a gagging order			0
however , he did receive a legal warning from the trust ’s lawyers that stated he should not disclose the terms of the agreement sealing his departure			0
mr @entity1 added : ‘ @entity2 was warned by @entity19 and by me that the trust would start slipping into @entity11 territory if the demands to meet non-urgent targets continued			1
‘ @entity19 was taken out and shot			2
after he was ousted , there were letters from clinicians saying that the balance between safety and targets had changed and safety was being compromised			2
ousted : whistleblower @entity19 , left , was ' taken out and shot ' after warning sir @entity2 , right , that @entity3 trust was ' slipping into @entity11 territory ' , according to @entity1 ' if it ’s the case that patients came to harm after those letters were written because of the mindless pursuit of non-urgent targets , then those who failed to act should be held to account			1
' he said his concerns about patient safety began in 2008 when staff started complaining about the conduct and behaviour of senior employees of the @entity111			1
‘ they complained of harassment and bullying and remorseless desire to meet targets at all costs , ’ he added			0
' i was told that i needed to meet targets regardless of the hospital being over-full			2
' there was an unwillingness to understand that over-full hospitals are dangerous and a complete denial of guidelines that state that when hospitals are over-full , targets should be temporarily suspended			0
' pressure : @entity1 said he was told to meet targets regardless of the fact that the hospital was over-full he said he was horrified when mr @entity19 told him he had been pressured to come off @entity132 , a declaration made when a hospital is too full to treat every patient			1
this culminated in mr @entity1 and the trust ’s board writing a letter to sir @entity1 warning of the dangers of breaching the guidelines			2
he added : ‘ i was put under such pressure that i got the whole board , including @entity19 , to refuse to put targets before patient safety			1
i remember @entity19 saying at the time : “ i ’m dead meat			0
they will come after me for this			0
” and sure enough , they did			0
’ he said when he raised concerns , it was made clear to him by @entity154 , who had been head of the @entity155 and is now head of commissioning for the @entity8 , that targets took precedence			0
she is under investigation for allegedly putting targets before patient care			0
a @entity163 spokesman said last night : ‘ in 2009 , sir @entity1 swiftly commissioned an independent review to look at claims made by @entity1 and @entity19 with regards to bullying and harassment by @entity155			1
‘ allegations of this nature are taken extremely seriously			0
the review concluded there was no evidence whatsoever to back the claims and a summary of the review ’s findings and sir @entity1 ’s response were published at the time			2
‘ following concerns about the trust in 2009 , @entity179 , the @entity155 ’s director of nursing carried out a full review into the quality of services			0
‘ the review concluded there were no immediate concerns in respect of patient safety , quality of care or quality of experience			1
‘ however , the review did confirm that there appeared to be a lack of strategic direction at the trust and that clinical governance arrangements were weak and action was taken to tackle this			0
’ an @entity155 spokesman said : ‘ we completely refute any allegations that patient safety is not a priority at the @entity155 or that staff here were responsible for bullying and harassment			1

@entity1 told sir @entity208 was under ' huge pressure ' to meet non-urgent targets
said patient safety was being compromised in same way as @entity14
