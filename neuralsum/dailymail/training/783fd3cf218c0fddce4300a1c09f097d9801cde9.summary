by @entity0 published : 12:05 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 20:30 est , 27 january 2014 international development secretary @entity2 announced @entity3 is to almost treble to £ 1.8 billion a year the amount of foreign aid devoted to boosting emerging economies someof the biggest names on the @entity8 are to be handed @entity3 aid money to improve conditions for their foreign suppliers			1
retail giants such as @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 will be eligible for grants to help improve the lives of the @entity19 farmers and manufacturers who supply their stores			2
but critics questioned why some of @entity3 ’s most successful and highly profitable firms are being given taxpayers ’ cash for projects they could easily fund themselves			1
schemes include cash for budget clothing chain @entity30 to improve conditions in @entity34 ’s notorious sweatshops			2
@entity30 – along with @entity35 and @entity14 – will be funded to run an initiative to ‘ improve the management of garment factories ’			2
and @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 will receive cash for a scheme to help @entity34 factories ‘ rapidly meet labour and safety standards ’			2
the initiatives follow the collapse of the @entity50 factory complex in @entity34 last year , which claimed more than 1,100 lives			2
more than 40 @entity53 retailers , including @entity30 , are thought to have sourced clothing from the giant plant			1
the controversial projects come amid mounting criticism that @entity3 ’s overseas aid programme – which is set to hit more than £ 12billion this year – is already unjustifiable at a time of domestic spending cuts			1
the amount the @entity3 government hands out is due to rise from £ 8billion in order to hit a target of 0.7 per cent of @entity65 , but critics believe it is too high while spending on schools and hospitals is being squeezed at home			1
in a speech at the @entity71 yesterday , international development secretary @entity2 said the move was part of a wider push to focus more of the aid budget on economic development			1
this would boost long - term trade , from which @entity3 could benefit , she said			2
but @entity80 mp @entity79 said : ‘ it is quite extraordinary , and quite wrong , to be subsidising big companies in this way			1
@entity30 will work with @entity35 and @entity14 to improve the management of clothing factories in @entity34 ‘ i think ordinary taxpayers will be very surprised indeed to find they are subsidising the likes of @entity13 and @entity14 to improve conditions for their suppliers			0
‘ these companies should be improving their supply chains because it ’s the right thing to do , not because they are going to get a government grant to do it			0
‘ it ’s another example of the problems you get when you set an arbitrary target for spending money on aid – you end up spending it for the sake of it			0
’ @entity105 , campaign director of the @entity106 , described the scheme as a ‘ totally inappropriate ’ use of public money			0
@entity15 will ' develop the leadership and management skills of farm workers ' in @entity113 and @entity114 while @entity115 ’s will help workers gain qualifications he said the initiative was a form of ‘ corporate welfare ’ , with taxpayers ’ cash being used to help salve the consciences of corporations that are sometimes accused of exploiting suppliers in the developing world			0
mr @entity105 said : ‘ the aid budget is meant to help the world ’s poorest , not provide corporate welfare across the globe			0
’ miss @entity2 said a number of leading firms had already signed up to the £ 4million trade in @entity134			1
@entity14 , a subsidiary of the @entity137 retail giant @entity135 , the world ’s second biggest public corporation , has already put forward two proposals			0
@entity15 will receive money for a project to develop the ‘ leadership and management skills ’ of farm workers in @entity113 and @entity114			0
another initiative will see @entity115 ’s establish an ‘ innovative radio show ’ for farmers in @entity146 and @entity14 will be given grants to help pay for the training of ‘ young fruit farm workers from disadvantaged backgrounds in @entity114 ’			0
a rescue worker stands in front of the rubble of the collapsed @entity50 clothing factory building in @entity34 in april 2013 the firms are eligible for grants of up to £ 750,000 each to help pay for projects			1
in return they have to provide a similar amount of their own money			0
a source at the @entity165 ( @entity165 ) last night said the scheme would help 700,000 workers in the developing world and insisted the department was not subsidising wealthy corporations			0
‘ none of this money is invested in the companies themselves , ’ the source said			0
‘ instead , it is invested in development projects that would not otherwise get off the ground			1
’ critics claim @entity165 has a patchy record on boosting economic development			1
last month miss @entity2 was forced to close the £ 100million trademark @entity182 initiative following a damning report that found senior staff were receiving ‘ lavish ’ six - figure salaries , with at least one paid more than @entity186 .			1
