the bug specifically targets what ’s known as the network time protocol ( @entity80 ) , used to synchronise clocks on computers			1
the protocol is a global way of synchronising time over a network , and because of its link to networks it has previously been exploited by hackers			2
@entity0 ’s @entity4 software uses @entity80 , but it is also used by servers and other companies that run @entity93 software , for example			1
however , no firms have reported any cases of hackers exploiting this vulnerability			0
@entity0 's update is available for @entity100 v10.8.5 , @entity101 v10.9.5 and @entity102 v10.10.1			2

by selecting this option , the @entity4 installs @entity9 and app updates overnight as they become available			0
the computer then , typically , automatically restarts as part of the update process			0
people who do n't enable the @entity134 feature are shown a notification in the @entity0 menu telling them updates are available			0
automatic updates can be disabled on @entity4 by going to the @entity0 menu , @entity139 and unchecking ‘ install system data files and security updates ’ .			2
