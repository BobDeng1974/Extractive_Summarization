sleepless nights could be an early sign of alzheimer ’s disease			0
scans showed that brains of people who were sleepy during the day contained higher levels of a toxic protein called beta - amyloid			1
a hallmark of @entity11 ’s , it interferes with brain function , disrupting memory , mood and behaviour			1
sleepless nights could be an early sign of alzheimer ’s disease			0
scans showed that brains of people who were sleepy during the day contained higher levels of a toxic protein called beta - amyloid ; pictured is a stock image of a woman suffering from @entity11 's disease researchers from the @entity28 asked 98 people aged between 50 and 73 to fill in a questionnaire about their quality of @entity33 volunteers also underwent brain scans			1
those who tossed and turned at night or were sleepy during the day had more beta - amyloid in parts of the brain ravaged by @entity11			1
more research is needed to work out if people sleep badly because they are in the early stages of @entity11 ’s			1
or if , in fact a lack of rest actually feeds the disease			0
if this is the case and loss of sleep is damaging the brain , finding ways of improving people ’s quality of sleep could help keep the brain healthy into old age			2
@entity11 ’s and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 @entity57 and , worldwide , the number of sufferers is predicted to treble to 44million by 2050 as the population ages			1
with no cure for dementia and existing drugs of limited use , the prime minister @entity61 has described dementia as ‘ the key health challenge of this generation ’			0
dr @entity68 , of @entity69 , said it was n’t known if the amounts of beta - amyloid found in the scans would be enough to trigger memory loss the study , presented at the @entity76 of @entity78 ’s annual conference , is one of several recent pieces of research to link lack of sleep with beta - amyloid levels			2
dr @entity68 , of @entity69 , said it was n’t known if the amounts of beta - amyloid found in the scans would be enough to trigger memory loss			2
she said : ‘ some elderly people have amyloid plaques in their brains but never go on to develop alzheimer ’s disease , so it is far too early to say whether the amount of sleep you regularly get is important in the development of dementia and those who have a bad night ’s sleep should not worry			0
‘ take regular exercise , eat a healthy diet and avoid smoking to help keep your brain healthy			0

people who were sleepy during the day had higher levels of beta - amylouid
the toxic protein *clogs* up the brain and stops brain cells from relating
