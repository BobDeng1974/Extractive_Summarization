by @entity0 published : 08:48 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 08:49 est , 30 october 2013 trenches 23,000 feet deep , psychedelic spirals of lava and the highest known mountain in the solar system - these are just some of the highlights see by the @entity10 spacecraft over the past decade			1
@entity10 , launched in 2003 , has now orbited the planet nearly 12,500 times , providing scientists with unprecedented images and data collected by its range of scientific instruments			1
the data have been used to create an almost global digital topographic model of @entity21 ' surface , providing a unique flyby video			1
‘ for the first time , we can see @entity21 spatially – in three dimensions , ’ said @entity32 , project manager for the mission at the @entity29 ( @entity34 )			2
@entity10 reached its destination on 25 december 2003 – and caused an initial shock			2
the @entity27 took its first close look down towards @entity21 and sent back an almost plain white image			2
this was the first of many images of a crater taken from the spacecraft 's camera at an altitude of 277 km as well as images from the @entity52 , @entity50 's @entity49 has been capturing images from the ground			0
the above southward uphill view was taken when the rover began to ascend the northwestern slope of ' @entity58 ' on the western rim of @entity21 ' @entity60			2
the view combines five frames taken by @entity49 's navigation camera on the 3,463rd @entity21 day , or sol , of the rover 's work on @entity21			2
opportunity had begun climbing the hill on @entity69 and completed three additional uphill drives before reaching this point			0
the rover team is using the rover to investigate outcrops on the slope			0
the northward - facing slope will tilt the rover 's solar panels toward the sun in the southern - hemisphere winter sky , providing an important energy advantage for continuing mobile operations through the upcoming winter			0
‘ everyone just swallowed , ’ recalled mr @entity32			0
scientists were worried that the camera had failed			0
but one of the nine different channels of the camera – the infrared channel – was still showing weak contours of the surface of @entity21			1
the solution to the problem was quickly found ; the sensitivity of the camera close to @entity21 was much greater than that expected by the researchers , meaning that the first image was overexposed			0
two @entity21 orbits later , on 10 january 2004 , and with the correct exposure time , the first of many successful images was acquired from an altitude of 277 kilometres			2
since then an almost complete 3d global view of the @entity21 has been created from the numerous images			2
the scientists put the camera images together piece by piece like a jigsaw puzzle , creating a global map of @entity21			1
of the 145 million square kilometres of the surface of @entity21 , 97 million have already been covered at very high resolution , where one pixel corresponds to less than 20 metres on the surface			1
almost the entire surface of @entity21 has now been imaged at a resolution of better than 100 metres			1
the @entity118 view of the valleys , canyons and lava flows is possible because of the unusual imaging principle used by the camera			0
@entity124 pictured here is a system of canyons that runs along the @entity21 surface east of the @entity128			1
at more than 4,000 km long and 200 km wide , the @entity124 rift system is one of the larger canyons of the solar system nine light - sensitive detectors sweep the surface in sequence from nine different observation angles			1
this data is then processed into three - dimensional images by the @entity34 planetary researchers			1
‘ we can see the entire topography almost as well as if we were standing on @entity21 ourselves , ’ said mrs @entity140			0
although the conditions on @entity21 are no longer suitable for the existence of liquid water , at some time in its past water must have flowed over its surface , scouring out deep valleys in the highlands and creating huge outflow valleys three to four billion years ago			1
using the camera 's super resolution channel , images can be acquired that are so rich in detail that geological processes in which water was involved can be seen			0
it is likely that there were periods of flowing and standing water during the history of this planet , which is so dry and dusty today			0
of the 145 million square kilometres of the surface of @entity21 , 97 million have already been covered at very high resolution , where one pixel corresponds to less than 20 metres on the surface this means that different climatic conditions must have been predominant in the planet ’s early history			1
this is also clearly visible in the three - dimensional camera images showing structures near the equator that have been caused by glaciation			0
‘ the @entity10 mission was due to end after one @entity21 year – or about two @entity178 years , ’ said mr @entity32			1
but during the past 10 years the @entity179 ( @entity179 ) has kept extending the mission			0
the spacecraft is now due to continue orbiting @entity21 until the end of 2014			0
mr @entity32 added : ‘ that is actually the bottom line on the past 10 years ; everything is still functioning perfectly and we are still acquiring new data that is important for @entity21 research			1

@entity190 was put together using images taken over ten years by @entity10
nine detectors sweeped the surface in sequence from nine different angles
this data was then processed into three dimensional images by scientists
most of @entity21 ' surface has been imaged at resolution better than 100 metres
