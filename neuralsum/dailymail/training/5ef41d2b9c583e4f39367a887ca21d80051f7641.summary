@entity1 manager @entity0 challenged misfiring loan striker @entity2 to ' prove himself ' in the build - up to saturday 's west @entity5 clash			1
the 28 - year - old promptly wasted four prime chances to score , including twice failing to fire into an empty net			1
despite another off - kilter display , @entity1 boss @entity8 said : ' i think he did well			2
' @entity2 stands in the middle of the @entity13 pitch with his hands on his hips the @entity1 star ( left ) posted a victory picture with team - mate @entity18 on his @entity19 @entity1 's @entity21 manager added : ' it 's not so important what i think , because he wants to score goals			1
' and for me i have to judge how he has played			0
' scoring goals is an important aspect of a striker i know , but for me it 's also very important if he is an attacking point , that he can play further and that with another striker we are coming into third and fourth phases of our attack			2
' and i think he did well			0
' @entity8 sent @entity1 into action in an unorthodox 3 - 3 - 2 - 2 formation that struggling @entity39 were still able to pick apart regularly in the first half			1
@entity41 started up front alongside @entity2 , but @entity1 were unable to gain tactical control			1
@entity2 smashes a shot towards the @entity39 goal for @entity1 @entity46 ( left ) and @entity47 ( right ) of @entity39 challenge @entity2 during the first - half at @entity13 the travelling @entity1 fans chanted ' attack , attack , attack ' and even ' four - four - two , four - four - two ' in demanding a system change - and eventually the @entity56 ' boss relented			1
a switch to a 4 - 4 - 2 diamond bore the two - goal fruit vital for victory , but @entity8 felt it would have been risky to start with that set - up			1
' i know in advance that when we play with four midfielders in a diamond that we create more chances , but then the balance of the team is also weak , ' said @entity8			0
' and you 've seen it because we had created chances but so had @entity39			2
' we have to decide every week how we have to play			0
and that 's the question			0
' @entity39 's goalkeeper @entity74 ( left ) rushes out to deny @entity2 when the @entity75 takes a shot at him @entity74 dives to his right with his hands out to prevent @entity2 from scoring on saturday at @entity13 ' but also with the other system we played against @entity82 , maybe you remember the first half we created maybe six or seven more chances than today , and we did n't score			1
' so it 's always the question , are you effective enough ? ' against @entity87 away we scored two out of three chances and we won the game			0
' but it was not because we were the better team at that time			0
' last week we were the better team , but in football it is not always the better team who wins			0
' in the first half we played like @entity39 wanted			2
' we did the same thing as @entity39 , playing through the air , long balls , and @entity39 were better			2
' in the second half we changed the shape and that helped also			0

@entity0 had challenged @entity2 to ' prove himself '
the misfiring striker failed to find the net in 2 - 0 victory on saturday
@entity39 goalkeeper @entity74 denied @entity2 three times at @entity13
