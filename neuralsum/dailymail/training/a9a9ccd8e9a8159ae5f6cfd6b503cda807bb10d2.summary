it may look like something a @entity3 villain would conjure up as a base for their evil regime , but this research vessel set to be stationed in the middle of the ocean is actually a marine research facility			1
called @entity11 , the floating aquatic lab has been designed by @entity14 architect @entity13 and construction is due to start in 2014			1
almost two - thirds of the 170 - ft tall ship will sit underwater making it possible to directly study ecosystems and fish levels at great depths			1
it has a platform lift for divers on the left - hand side , while stern thrusters power the ship			0
bunks for the crew as well as the vip cabin and @entity37 's room are on the right - hand side			0
the retractable keel weighs 180 tonnes @entity14 architect @entity13 designed the incredible structure			2
a countdown on the @entity11 site claims construction will start in 201 days , which would make the start 31 may 2014			2
the project will cost $ 52.7 million and has support from @entity46 and the @entity47 because the conditions on the @entity11 are similar to those found in space			0
the 1,000 tonne vessel is 170ft tall but almost two thirds of this will be underwater , between 18 and 22 marine biologists will live on the hybrid boat laboratory			1
it will be the only vessel allowing 24 - hour exploration			0
between 18 and 22 marine biologists will be able to live on board the vessel at any one time because it has living quarters and kitchens			1
the laboratory part of the 1,000 - tonne ship will sit below the surface to make the @entity11 buoyant , but to also give a direct line of sight and access into the ocean to depths of up to 6,000 metres			1
according to @entity13 , the @entity11 will additionally feature a ‘ fish - collection system for studies of the pelagic ecosystem , plankton biodiversity , and fish stocks			2
’ architect @entity13 developed the concept of the ocean lab around 12 years ago			0
he built his first underwater house on 4 august 1977			0
in 1981 he launched the @entity81 , a scientific base suspended in mid-water that slept two people			0
the @entity85 was capable of diving to depths of around 12 metres and could stay underwater for between seven and 15 days at a time			0
called @entity11 , the 1,000 - tonne floating aquatic lab , pictured , was designed by @entity14 architect @entity13			1
construction on the ship is due to start in may 2014			2

@entity13 said : ‘ @entity11 is the only vessel in the world allowing a 24 - hour exploration on long - term missions of the open sea and the abyss			2
’ this computer generated image shows what the @entity11 will look like underwater			0
the @entity14 - designed ship will be able to explore depths of around 6,000 metres			1
between 18 and 22 marine biologists will live on board at any one time because it has living quarters and kitchens this is how the @entity11 is expected to look from the ocean floor			1
the laboratory part of the ship , pictured , will sit below the surface to make the @entity11 buoyant , but to also give a direct line of sight and access into the ocean it is also environmentally friendly and sustainable because it is powered using solar , wind and wave energy			1
although the @entity11 has been designed to drift with ocean currents , the @entity147 and @entity148 systems ( @entity149 ) is also said to be developing a biofuel that could be used as a secondary power source			0
previously @entity13 told @entity152 that the @entity11 : ‘ would become an essential tool in exploring the world ’s oceans and an useful base to study the link between global warming and the oceans , which absorb about a quarter of all carbon emissions			0
’ the @entity11 vessel , pictured , will be powered by wind , wave and solar energy			1

construction on the marine research facility called @entity11 is due to start by may 2014
two - thirds of the 170 - ft tall vessel will sit underwater to give it buoyancy and offer a direct line of sight to the ocean
between 18 and 22 marine biologists will be able to study ecosystems and fish levels on board at any one time
the @entity14 - designed craft weighs 1,000 tonnes and will be powered by wind , wave and solar energy
