the couple sent their children to a £ 32,000 - a - year school while also funding £ 2,000 - a - month in rent on their home			2
but the pair are alleged to have falsely claimed a total of £ 42,500 , consisting of £ 19,000 of pension benefit , £ 19,000 of housing benefit and £ 4,500 of council tax benefit to fund their lifestyle			1
on trial : @entity7 and @entity28 are accused of claiming £ 42,000 of benefits while getting an income from several businesses and £ 50,000 in the bank , a court has heard mr and mrs @entity7 say they were penniless as a number of businesses went bust and needed state support			1
this was received while mrs @entity7 got money from her mum , there was income from the pair 's businesses and business account were being used for personal expenditure , it was said			1
prosecutors also say they had around £ 50,000 in the bank , but today a second forensic accountant told the court she felt that the @entity53 had no income entering their bank accounts			1
mr @entity28 , 67 , had been receiving pension credit since november 2007 , despite running his wife 's companies , @entity58 , @entity60 and @entity61 , prosecutors claim			1
funds were used to sent their children to @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 , and to pay for expensive child care and high rent			0
@entity68 , told the opening of the trial : ' we say @entity33 and mrs @entity7 knew they were under an obligation to inform the @entity74 and the council of money coming into their accounts which affected their entitlement to benefits			1
' the prosecution say they had income coming in from three sources			0
between september 2010 and oct 2011 mrs @entity7 received £ 40,000 from her parents			1
' there was also income from her position as a director of three limited companies that were trading during the material time and which mr @entity28 was running			1
' and they were using their business accounts for personal expenditure			0
' investigations into their affairs began when questions were raised about how they were able to pay £ 1,950 a month rent with just £ 775 a month housing allowance			2
mrs @entity7 was questioned by benefit officials in may 2010 and said that her parents had paid the rent shortfalls and school fees			1
top private school : the @entity53 ' children attended £ 32,000 - a - year @entity63 in @entity64 while the couple was claiming benefits , the court heard the couple , from @entity64 , claim that the firms they were involved in at the time were in liquidation			1
on wednesday a forensic accountant told the court that after analysing the pair 's bank accounts it was clear they had more than £ 48,000 available to them			2
he explained that between them the pair had four bank accounts and his job was to analyse the accounts to decide what was ' personal ' income and what related to the business			0
he told the jury that he assessed each payment made and even went through nine ring binders full of receipts to try and ascertain where cash had been spent			0
in his report he also asked : ' what is income ? luxury items such as school fees , extravagant holidays , expensive purchases , nice clothes , could all mean an income			2
' if you 're spending on these things there must be a source to do it			0
' but they could also be the result of credit cards debts , or gifts			0
school fees for example , which were on their bank statements , imply an income , or it could just be the result of a gift			2
' the accountant , @entity154 , concluded that the pair had a total of £ 48,206.59 , which was assessable for pension credit			2
he told that £ 40,000 of that had come from mrs @entity7 's mother			1
on trial : speaking at @entity6 ( above ) , prosecutor @entity68 told the court the couple had claimed a total of about £ 42,500 to which they were not entitled the defence argued that it therefore counted as a gift , but when prosecutor , @entity68 , asked the witness : ' would a gift of £ 40,000 be eligible for pension credit ? ' he responded : ' i believe so '			1
mr and mrs @entity7 both deny falsely claiming pension credits and housing and council tax benefit without declaring they had other income			1
but defence witness @entity177 - a forensic accountant - said the couple were clearly struggling with money as a number of their businesses went under			2
she explained how @entity183 , a coffee shop opened in @entity185 and @entity186 , was hoped to become a chain but it collapsed shortly after opening			0
instead the pair opened a restaurant called @entity191 in @entity64			0
the couple also opened @entity193 , a company aimed at running fast food outlets which ran for just two months			0
the couple 's building companies , @entity58 and @entity60 also went into liquidation			0
mrs @entity177 also argued that the £ 40,000 given to @entity7 by her mother was clearly a loan and did not count as income			1
she said : ' they were struggling			0
they were doing their best to make things work			0
they had a number of businesses and they had become accustomed to a certain lifestyle			0
' their businesses went under but they were trying to maintain that level of living			0
' it took them about a year to try and get back on their feet financially			0
' i do n't believe they were receiving any income			0
i understood the money to be a short term loan from mrs @entity7 's mother to get her back on her feet			2
