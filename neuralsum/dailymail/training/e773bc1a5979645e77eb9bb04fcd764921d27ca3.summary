by @entity0 for more than 50 - years rumors have persisted of a top - secret base operated by the @entity3 - from where the spy agency planned the 1961 @entity5 and still keeps stockpiles of chemical weapons			1
its existence has never been officially confirmed , but a new investigation claims the location for the covert base is in fact just 20 miles north of @entity14 , @entity15 , at the @entity17 facility @entity18			1
referred to mysteriously over the years by the anodyne @entity20 , the bland code word belies the supposed role it has played over the years as the @entity3 fought clandestine wars in @entity23 , to iran - contra to the arming of @entity27 rebels			1
totally nondescript : this is the bland entrance to @entity18 outside @entity14 - which reportedly is the site for the @entity3 's most secret base - @entity20 documents that reveal brief mentions have been poured over by the @entity32 , while former @entity3 analyst @entity33 has indicated that @entity18 is indeed the storied third @entity3 facility in the @entity35 , in addition to the agency 's headquarters in @entity39 , @entity40 , and @entity41 , a military base near @entity42 , @entity40 , known by its code name , ' @entity41			1
' @entity33 asserts that the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) was established in 1949 and ' has always been the cover for @entity20 , then the covert facility dates to the earliest days of the @entity3 and , speculatively , may have been created to provide an arms channel to resistance groups in @entity50 - occupied @entity49 and elsewhere			2
' indeed , @entity18 has most likely played a hitherto unheralded role in some of the most contentious historical events since the 1960s			0
it is allegedly where @entity56 exiles prepared for the disastrous and farcical @entity5 attempt to topple @entity58			2
the facility has also been tied to arming rebels in @entity61 and providing @entity63 rifles to @entity27 's @entity64 after 9/11 , so that they could battle the @entity65			1
' to be a little dramatic about it , how many of those @entity63 and rpg - 7s we see @entity69 waving around today passed through the @entity20 on their way to freedom fighters in past decades ? ' @entity33 told @entity32			2
run of the mill : this is an aerial shot of the base known as @entity20 - which is where the @entity3 reportedly keeps its supply of weapons for far - off wars a huge grey area of 4,000 acres on the map , @entity18 is south of @entity82 ranch near @entity83 10 , 20 miles of downtown @entity14			1
it maintains a low - key gatehouse and some visible warehouses around the perimeter			0
satellite images reveals dozens of nondescript bunkers lining the interior of the base			0
according to the @entity32 , @entity18 is so secret that a congressional investigator during the @entity92 in the 1980s made the observation that the facility where the @entity3 kept missiles bound for @entity96 classified , even as other ' incredible things were unveiled during the hearings			0
' three years ago it was acknowledged that the base was a munitions storage facility , but no more			0
failed invasion : @entity58 's troops at @entity104 after successfully repelling the @entity35 - backed invasion of the @entity106 - which was allegedly planned at @entity18 in the 1960s repelled : @entity58 conducts a mass interview of the prisoners captured in the unsuccessful @entity106 invasion ' the mission of @entity18 is the receipt , storage and issuance of ordnance material as well as quality assurance testing and maintenance of military weapons and ammunition , ' @entity111 , a spokesman for the @entity112 and @entity113 , said monday			0
' because of its ordnance missions , @entity18 is a controlled - access facility			0
' however , research published in december by retired @entity3 analyst @entity33 , who worked for the @entity3 from 1972 - 1985 , includes a ' 1967 @entity3 memo linking @entity18 to paramilitary training of @entity56 exiles before the 1961 @entity5 and a 1987 memo showing that equipment bound for the @entity132 passed through ' the facility , according to the @entity32			1
in their research @entity32 also discovered a 1963 @entity3 memo that discusses 300 tons of @entity137 plastic explosives available in the ' @entity20 stocks ' with no restrictions ' because the items have world - wide distribution and are consequently deniable			1
' @entity39 : @entity143 is one of only two acknowledged facilities used by the spy agency - the other one being @entity41 , a military base near @entity42 , @entity40 , known by its code name , @entity41 a 2009 interview with an anonymous @entity3 logistics officer claimed that @entity63 rifles sent to the @entity64 after 9/11 came from the @entity20			1
also , arms sent to anti-marxist fighters in the @entity23 civil war in the 1970s claimed the same			0
@entity33 , who claims to have never known the location of @entity20 during his time at the @entity3 told the @entity32 he had found an explicit reference in a 1986 memo by the notorious colonel @entity159 - the key figure in the iran - contra affair			1
the memo stated that the @entity3 would transport missiles bound for @entity96 to ' @entity20 , @entity15 ' in anticipation of flying them out of @entity166			2
mentioned in memos : lieutenant - colonel @entity159 , former aide to former national security adviser @entity168 , is sworn in on 9 december 1986 before the @entity170 hearing in @entity171 on arms sales to @entity96 supplied : an @entity64 fighter mans the front line against the @entity65 october 2 , 2001 near @entity175 , 30 miles north of @entity176 , @entity27 in july , according to @entity33 , the army bought two million rounds of ammunition of the same caliber to fit @entity63 , which @entity35 soldiers do not use			1
the delivery address was @entity18			0
however , the key revelation in identifying @entity18 as @entity20 was the 2011 lawsuit filed by former @entity3 employee @entity185			0
he claimed his family , who lived at a government owned house at @entity18 , fell ill because of toxins at the base			0
the lawsuit and subsequent memoir written by @entity185 was prevented , but his son @entity194 , who is not bound by confidentiality has written a memoir of his own			0
in it he refers to @entity18 as ' a secret base which had been used for illegal arms running and chemical weapons storage			2

@entity202 is *reputed* to be the top secret @entity3 base known only as @entity20
rumored to have been the training center used by @entity56 exiles prior to the 1961 @entity106 *fiasco*
only 20 miles south of @entity14 , the base was also reportedly a staging ground for the transportation of missiles during iran - contra
the 4,000 acre also hold @entity63 rifles supplied to @entity27 , @entity216 and @entity23 rebels
reported to store the spy agencies supplies of chemical weapons , and explosives
