a new study has found that a third of female university students in the @entity3 have been sexually assaulted a third of female university students have been sexually assaulted with almost half of them admitting they did n't even report the attack to their family , according to a new survey			1
the study found that 31 per cent of female students polled said they had experienced ' inappropriate touching or groping ' while at institutions in the @entity3			1
it also found that 43 per cent of those who had experienced unwanted advances did not report it to the university or even their family and friends			1
the study carried out by research group @entity25 for the @entity26 comes amid calls by charities for new guidelines warning higher education institutions could be breaching the law by not investigating reported sexual abuse			0
it also found that one in eight men who responded said they had been groped or had unwanted advances			1
meanwhile more than half of the women and a third of men polled said they knew of someone else who had experienced behaviour ranging from touching to rape			2
professor @entity43 , director of health and wellbeing at @entity46 , told the paper : ' it is unacceptable that a third of women and 12 per cent of men said they had faced unwelcome sexual advances			1
' it is crucial that those on the ground , the students , feel confident and safe enough to take active steps when they witness a problem , or experience domestic harassment themselves			0
' the new study comes just months after universities were accused of failing to combat a widespread ‘ lads ’ culture ’ which has seen unwanted sexual advances and jokes about rape become commonplace			0
student leaders warned that harassment was ‘ rife ’ on campus after another survey also found that more than a third of female students have been groped or touched inappropriately and almost two thirds said they had heard jokes about rape or sexual assault			1
the same survey also revealed a lack of awareness of procedures in place at universities designed to tackle inappropriate behaviour , with 60 per cent saying they were unaware of any codes of conduct written by their university or their students ’ union			2
speaking at the time , @entity88 , from the @entity90 campaign , said : ‘ students are experiencing sexism , sexual harassment and assault within the university environment			0
‘ it is worth mentioning that one category of such experiences “ inappropriate touching and groping ” actually constitutes sexual assault under @entity3 law			2
' however @entity102 , chief executive of @entity103 , added : ‘ if alleged criminal behaviour is involved , all universities would support any students reporting such incidents to the police			0
' it is important to remember that this is an issue for society generally , not just one confined to university students			0
