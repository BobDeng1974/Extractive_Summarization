the billionaire founder of @entity1 has launched a @entity3 tirade against ‘ ruthless ’ mobile phone networks , accusing them of forcing the company into administration			2
@entity8 , who sold the business in 2006 , blasted both @entity10 and @entity11 after they ended contracts to supply handsets through the chain ’s 550 stores			1
but @entity10 claimed it was unable to negotiate competitive rates with phones 4u after its private equity firm owners loaded the company with £ 505million of debt – and used £ 200million to pay shareholders a dividend			1
the firm is being threatened with closure , despite the fact that it has generated sales of more than £ 1billion a year and a profit of £ 105million			1
all phones 4u stores will now remain closed while administrators investigate whether the chain has a future , and check to see whether there are sufficient funds to pay staff the wages they are owed			1
the company ’s demise has created confusion among customers , but the firm said existing contracts will be honoured and has promised that people who paid money up front for new handsets will be refunded			1
concern : founder @entity8 , who sold his stake for £ 1.5bn in 2006 , said he was ' desperately worried ' phones 4u was founded by entrepreneur @entity8 in 1987 , who sold the firm for £ 1.46billion in 2006 to @entity62 before it was bought by private equity firm @entity63 in 2011			1
flamboyant mr @entity8 , who lives with partner @entity64 – a former model – vented his fury at the company ’s demise on @entity3			1
in a series of damning messages he wrote : ‘ i am sickened and saddened for nearly 6000 wonderful employees who made phones 4u into a great business			1
’ shut : two men stand outside the closed phones 4u mobile phone store in @entity77 today @entity78 customer notice : staff at 550 @entity27 stores will learn today whether the business will reopen for trading he went on to say : ‘ such a sad day for phones 4u and all its employees ! brought to its knees by ruthless so - called “ partners ” moving in for the kill ! ! ! ’ however mr @entity8 was also critical of private equity firm @entity63 , which bought the firm using mainly borrowed money for £ 600million			1
he wrote : ‘ unfortunately , combination of short - term private equity strategy combined with ruthless network “ partners ” and government killed phones 4u			2
’ a @entity10 spokesman denied any inappropriate behaviour , saying : ‘ we were told by @entity99 that they had little commercial flexibility due to their debt repayment obligations			2
’ @entity11 said its decision not to renew its contract beyond september 2015 was driven by uncertainty over the firm ’s long - term viability			1
but @entity108 , from @entity63 , claimed the phone companies ’ decision was ‘ designed to inflict the maximum damage ’ , and had left the board with no alternative but to go into administration			0
yesterday employee @entity115 wrote online : ‘ hard - working people like myself who go to work to provide the best customer experience possible are about to lose their job by no fault of their own			0
’ and phones 4u chief executive @entity122 said : ‘ today is a very sad day for our customers and our staff			1
’ he added : ‘ a good company making profits of over £ 100million and employing thousands of decent people has been forced into administration			1
the result will be less competition , less choice and higher prices for @entity135 customers			1
’ i ordered an @entity137 , what happens now ? if you have ordered an @entity137 6 – or any phone – and it has not yet been dispatched , then your request will be cancelled and your money refunded			0
if the phone has been dispatched it should arrive as expected			0
how do i return faulty goods ? stores will remain closed until the administrators decide how the company will be dealt with			1
the website is also offline , but you can still call 0844 8712253 for customer services , and if you bought your mobile using a credit card and paid more than £ 100 you can ask your card company for a refund			1
if you paid by debit card you have similar protection under chargeback rules			0
will my mobile still work if they go bust ? yes			0
most people who bought a phone with @entity1 are actually customers of networks such as @entity11 , @entity165 , @entity10 and three			1
you will be able to use your phone as normal			0
will my bill increase ? phones 4u says any contract agreed with the shop should remain the same			2
but until administrators have calculated the assets of the company , there is no guarantee of this			0
is my mobile phone insurance still valid ? anyone who purchased mobile phone insurance from @entity1 should still be protected as the policy is operated by a separate firm			2
where do i go now to compare prices ? phones 4u was one of the few stores which offered contracts from a number of networks under one roof			2
the only major alternatives now are @entity193 , @entity194 and internet comparison sites			0
bled to death by the private equity leeches consumer choice and jobs on the @entity201 have once again been placed in jeopardy by the rapacious behaviour of one of @entity135 ’s private equity firms – which load the companies they buy with debt , then cut costs to the bone in an attempt to make instant profits , @entity198 writes			0
this time the group concerned is @entity63 , owners of no - frills phones 4u , which has fallen into administration			0
the collapse of @entity1 will give the shrinking band of mobile phone operators – @entity10 , @entity219 - controlled @entity165 and @entity11 ( forged from the merger of @entity221 and @entity222 in 2010 ) – an even tighter grip over the hugely valuable cell phone market			1
most consumers , bamboozled by the vast array of tariffs and phones , have traditionally turned to companies like @entity1 and @entity193 for neutral advice			0
the companies offered a path through a maze that only the most tech - savvy consumer could master on their own			0
but cost - cutting and a failure to invest coincided with the rise of smartphones being sold as design icons			2
so while phones 4u stores began to look increasingly utilitarian and downmarket , the mobile phone operators turned their own stores into high - tech emporiums selling high - priced items of beauty			2
this coincided with regulators clamping down on mobile call charges			0
phones 4u ’s pricing model had always been to discount the phones themselves , and make up the shortfall on high charges for calls			0
but the regulators ’ clampdown means , increasingly , that phone users today tend to pay more for the device – and they go to the phone operators ’ more upmarket stores to do so			1
@entity27 is threatened with closure many believe that the phone network operators deliberately picked a fight with @entity1 so that they could expand their own business operations by picking up some of its stores and staff on the cheap			1
the company has heaped opprobrium on the operators @entity165 – which pulled out of phones 4u stores in january – @entity11 and @entity10			1
the big three cancelled their contracts with phones 4u mainly after disputes about the share of profits they received for allowing the company to sell contracts on their networks			0
this was certainly a key factor behind the decision to call in the administrators			0
however , it is impossible to ignore the dead hand of private equity			0
in the eight years since @entity8 sold phones 4u to its first private equity outfit @entity292 , the retailer has been passed around among the private equity princelings like a second - hand vase at a car boot sale			1
after @entity292 , it was sold to private equity firm @entity62			1
then in 2011 it was sold on to its current private equity concern @entity63 , a derivation of the collapsed @entity299 merchant bank			1
all of these deals were financed using debt , and the priority of the owners has been to run the shops for immediate profit			0
the lack of investment in staff and store development has proved disastrous			2
while @entity193 recruited graduates , phones 4u did not			0
its staff were younger , less qualified and engaged in high - pressure tactics including ‘ streetfighting ’ – a practice of accosting would - be customers on the street			1
sales targets were raised while commissions paid to staff were allegedly cut			2
just to add salt to the wounds , @entity63 took on £ 200million of extra debts last year so they could pay their backers a special one - off dividend ... of £ 200million			2
in effect , they milked the company for all they could while running it into the ground			0
in the end , even though the company was still trading profitably , it was left with little option but to close			0
the immediate beneficiary of @entity1 ’s demise appears to be @entity193			0
shares in its parent @entity338 rose on the news of phone 4u ’s collapse , and it has promised to save 800 jobs at phone 4u franchises in stores controlled by @entity338			2
however the concern must be that the phone network operators which left phones 4u high and dry – to increase their stranglehold over the market – will eventually treat @entity193 with the same contempt			0
on the other hand , @entity193 believes it is in a stronger position as it is one of the country ’s biggest distributors of @entity357 , @entity358 and @entity360 products			0
phones 4u never took that course – with a private equity firm leeching away its lifeblood , it was not able to .			2

@entity8 , who sold firm for £ *1.5billion* in 2006 , said he was ' saddened '
firm *'s* 550 stores did not open today while staff wait to learn their future
