@entity1 senator @entity0 walked into enemy territory wednesday night – the often - dubbed ' @entity3 ' of @entity4 , @entity5 – and castigated @entity7 's spying apparatus before an unlikely constituency of well - wishers : college students from one of the most liberal universities in the @entity7 about 400 crowded into a @entity14 auditorium to hear the @entity16 civil libertarian rail against a @entity17 that shows ' sheer arrogance , ' and whose leaders are ' only sorry they got caught ' when leaker @entity21 spilled his guts			1
' no one on the [ @entity25 ] @entity24 was even contrite , ' @entity0 recalled , jabbing also at his colleagues			1
' their only regret was that the program was no longer secret			2
' ' your rights , especially your right to privacy , are under assault , ' he told the audience , in between stretches of sustained applause			2
' and appealing to college students ' unalienable right to mobile phone calls and text messages , he laid a major applause line on the table during the 40 - minute event			0
' i am here to tell you that if you own a cell phone , you ’re under surveillance , ' he declared			2
' i believe what you do on your cellphone is none of their damned business			0
' @entity0 slammed both the @entity51 and the @entity17 , saying they had concluded ' equal protection means @entity7 should be spied upon equally			1
' asked by the event 's moderator whether his outreach was part of a play for the presidency in 2016 , the strategically coy senator uttered only one word			1
' ' part of it might be that , ' he admitted			0
' part of it might be that			0
part of it might be that the @entity1 – i ’ve said they either have to evolve , adapt or die			0
' @entity0 is believed to be laying he groundwork for a @entity96 run , attracting new constituencies with a shrewd personal - privacy message that crosses party lines @entity100 ( r ) , the senator 's father and a former @entity103 congressman , attracted legions of ' @entity106 ' fans on the 2012 presidential campaign trail ; @entity0 may be able to mobilize a similar sleeping - giant groundswell of support @entity0 compared his own @entity1 to the @entity111 's chain , which admitted in its 2010 ' pizza turnaround ' ad push that it had been selling mediocre crust			1
' i think the @entity1 finally admitted it : " ok , bad crust , we need a different kind of party			0
since the beginning of 2013 @entity0 has tried to extend his appeal from the @entity1 's libertarian wing to what he calls ' liberty - minded ' @entity7 of all political stripes			1
that includes students at the university once known for hosting anti-establishment protests , not @entity1			0
last month he won the straw poll at the annual @entity129 , and this month he topped the tally at the more moderate @entity131			0
in april 2013 he strode into a lecture hall at @entity133 , the historically black college in @entity134 , and outlined a case for why young african - americans should n't reflexively vote for liberals – despite being disproportionate beneficiaries of government entitlement programs endorsed by the @entity54			2
he made a similar pitch in february at @entity141 in his home state			0
days later the interim president of the @entity144 said during a @entity146 interview that she would like @entity0 to speak with her group about his plan for rescuing the financially devastated city of @entity150			1
' @entity151 ' : the campus where sen. @entity0 spoke on wednesday is known for its flavor of outspoken liberalism , but he drew consistent applause and a standing ovation from hundreds there kumbayah , 164 edition : @entity161 sang to hundreds of @entity4 students 50 years ago during a rally inspired by the radical group @entity165 he has outlined a program of ' economic freedom zones ' where bankrupted and economically depressed cities could operate under dramatically lowered tax rates and broadly loosened government regulation , in order to revitalize commerce and stop mass - stampedes to the suburbs			1
but @entity0 's chief message was that ' no one – no one should be allowed to invade your privacy			1
' he announced that he would push for a new and independent congressional committee including members from both parties , with ' full power to investigate and reform those who spy on us in the name of protecting us			0
' ' it should watch the watchers			0
' he took one slap at president @entity191 , calling it ' ironic that the first @entity193 - @entity7 president has , without compunction , allowed this vast exercise of raw power by the @entity17			1
' ' certainly [ former fbi director ] @entity199 's illegal spying on @entity200 and others in the civil rights movement should give us all pause			2
