@entity1 scientists have developed a pair of anti-shark wetsuits that make divers appear invisible by camouflaging their bodies in the sea and trick sharks into thinking surfers are poisonous			1
a team of researchers from the @entity11 joined forces with designers from @entity14 ( @entity14 ) to create the suits			0
the blue pattern of the elude suit ca n't be seen by the shark because the fish are colour blind			1
while the stripes on the diverter suit mimic the colours of poisonous fish to warn the sharks off			1
scientists and shark experts took two years to develop the wetsuit which acts like an invisibility cloak underwater in a bid to keep swimmers safe a surfer ( left ) and a diver ( right ) wear the two styles of wetsuits with the surfer holding a surfboard			1
the technology was designed by @entity14 in collaboration with the @entity49 at the @entity11 the creators claim the suits could save lives			0
the elude wetsuit is designed to be used by swimmers and divers and are covered in a jagged blue pattern , which works to conceal divers from sharks			1
the predators were recently found to be colour blind			2
while sharks are known to have a keen sense of smell , scientists believe that they rely heavily on their vision in the final - often deadly - phase of a shark attack			1
the pattern uses disruptive coloration and shaping , which is difficult for a shark to see and also blends in with background colours			2
the combination of contrasting colours and differing sizes of the shapes on the elude wetsuits ( pictured ) ensures optimal effect at various depths and distances , ' according to @entity14			1
the company believes that while a shark might smell or sense a person in the water , it is much less likely to attack if it can not see the target the new wetsuit designs , aimed at making a surfer look less like a seal - a favorite food for sharks - have been launched and tested in @entity90 this combination of contrasting colours and differing types and sizes of the shapes ' ensures optimal effect at various depths and distances , ' according to @entity14			1
the company believes that while a shark might smell or sense a person in the water , it is much less likely to attack if it can not see the target			2
scientists at @entity14 and the university also developed a wetsuit called diverter that works in the opposite way			1
it is designed to scare off sharks			2
the @entity108 wetsuit has navy and white stripes that are seen on some poisonous animals and fish to make the shark think they diver is dangerous			1
the designers have also created matching surfboard stickers			0
according to @entity14 , years of anecdotal evidence suggests that a stripe pattern acts as a deterrent or repellent to sharks			0
but the scientists found that very specific contrasting colours , shapes and dimensions work together for maximum effect			0
the reflective spectrum or light reflective properties of various colours that change at different water depths were of huge interest to the scientists			0
' by disrupting the sharks visual perception , an attack can either be diverted altogether , or at least delayed , allowing time for evasive action , ' @entity137 said			0
the diverter wetsuit ( pictured ) is designed for surfers and has bold navy and white stripes that mirror nature 's warning signs to present the wearer as something poisonous or unpalatable			1
according to @entity14 , years of anecdotal evidence suggests that a stripe pattern acts as a deterrent or repellent to sharks the team undertook extensive research to examine how sharks see and hunt underwater to create the wetsuits ( pictured )			1
scientists used molecular biology techniques to study the genes responsible for coding the retinal visual pigments found in sharks ' eyes to help them develop the patterns the team undertook extensive research to examine how sharks see and hunt underwater			1
professor @entity164 and professor @entity165 from the university used molecular biology techniques to study the genes responsible for coding the retinal visual pigments found in the eyes of selected species of large sharks			0
they wanted to isolate the effect that certain colours and shapes have on sharks ' sensory systems as well as if certain combinations were particularly conspicuous or unrecognisable to the underwater predators			0
they modelled various underwater light fields to determine the spatial resolving power , spectral sensitivity and light gathering ability of the shark visual system by using specialist research software			0
their findings led to the development of a patterned surface that seems either unrecognisable or dangerous to sharks - which is a lot more useful that the reflectance of a traditional wetsuit			0
@entity194 such as the great white ( pictured ) are some of nature 's most feared predators			0
the £ 300 wetsuits were developed by scientists in a bid to protect people from deadly shark attacks			1
there have been five fatal attacks off the coast of @entity206 in the last 12 months using their findings , they tested the patterns on computer models where divers swam at different depths , to determine the optimum contrasting stripe width and spacing			1
talking about the diverter design for surfers , professor @entity164 told @entity217 : ' many animals in biology are repelled by noxious animals – prey that provide a signal that somehow says ‘ do n't eat me ’ – and that has been manifest in a striped pattern			2
' we are using a lot of nature 's technology , based on high - contrast - based banding patterns			0
' the wearer will be obvious , and the idea is the shark will see that as an unpalatable food item and swim right by			0
' it is hoped that the wetsuit can reduce the number of people who are fatally attacked by sharks			0
@entity206 has suffered five fatal attacks in the last year , which gave the state its unfortunate reputation of shark attack capital of the world			2
the wetsuits took around two years to develop and cost around £ 300 ( $ 495 ) from @entity246			0
@entity14 has also developed stickers for surfboards ( pictured ) that are designed to be shark repellant in an effort to keep surfers safer			2

@entity1 scientists have developed wetsuits that prevent shark attacks
the elude suit conceals divers by exploiting the shark 's colour blindness
the striped diverter suit tricks sharks into thinking the surfer is poisonous
