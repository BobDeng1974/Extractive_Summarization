by @entity0 published : 20:47 est , 13 july 2013 updated : 03:17 est , 15 july 2013 @entity1 chided @entity2 for not knowing what @entity3 meant a senior judge has delivered the most damning verdict yet on the government ’s plans to deliver ‘ justice on the cheap ’ by letting giant companies bid for legal aid contracts			1
@entity1 mockingly suggested that following controversial reforms to how law firms work , members of the judiciary should compete to produce the most judgments in the shortest time – and receive sponsorship from @entity19 , @entity20 or @entity21 to help save the @entity23 money			0
in an after - dinner speech to the @entity27 last week , the @entity25 judge , 67 , described proposals by lord chancellor @entity29 as a ‘ joke ’ and chided @entity2 for not knowing what @entity3 meant			1
he warned that plans to take legal aid cases away from hundreds of high street firms and hand them to companies such as haulier @entity36 would create ‘ a desert ’ where choice would be meaningless			1
‘ what use is choice when you have nothing to choose save @entity44 ? what is the point of asking a man to choose still or sparkling water when you have left him to crawl in the desert ? ’ he said			0
‘ if lawyers are not to provide services of a quality above a level specified by the state , why should judges ? ’ @entity1 joked it was ‘ financially wasteful ’ to have lots of independent judges so they should ‘ amalgamate ’ and gain sponsors to cut costs			0
the comments are the most withering attack so far on legal aid reforms by a serving member of the judiciary			0
solicitors and barristers have led the charge against mr @entity29 ’s @entity70 plans , which would put dozens of small firms out of business by carving up legal aid contracts for criminal cases among a handful of corporations .			2
