by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 07:59 est , 5 december 2012 street-wise city birds are keeping their nests warm and pest - free by lining them with cigarette butts , research has shown			1
the nicotine and other chemicals in discarded filters act as a natural pesticide that repels parasitic mites			1
at the same time , the cellulose butts provide useful nest insulation			1
researchers discovered that birds , including house sparrows , are lining their nests with discarded cigarette butts wild birds are known to protect their nests from mite invasion by importing certain chemical - emitting plants			2
the new evidence suggests some birds species in the urban jungle have adapted the same behaviour to harness the repellent properties of tobacco			0
scientists in @entity27 studied nests of house sparrows and house finches that each contained , on average , about 10 used cigarette butts			1
the number of stubbed - out cigarettes incorporated into the nests ranged from none to as many as 48			0
in both species , nests with larger numbers of butts were significantly less infested by mites			2
to test the parasite - repelling effect , the researchers attached cellulose fibres from smoked and non-smoked filters to thermal traps placed in nests			2
the battery - operated traps attract mites by generating heat			0
fewer parasites were drawn to traps laced with nicotine - laden smoked butts			1
dr @entity56 , from the @entity57 , and his team wrote in the @entity60 journal @entity61 : ' we provide evidence that urban birds incorporate cellulose from smoked cigarette butts into the nest and that this behaviour entails a reduction in the number of nest - dwelling ectoparasites			1
the team say the birds use the butts to provide warmth to chicks because of its insulating properties , and because nicotine works as an insecticide ' it appears that this effect may be due to the fact that mites are repelled by nicotine , perhaps in conjunction with other substances , because thermal traps laced with cellulose from smoked butts attracted fewer ectoparasites than traps laced with non-smoked cellulose			1
' this novel behaviour observed in urban birds fulfils one of the three conditions necessary to be regarded as self - medication : it is detrimental to parasites			0
' nicotine is a natural defence chemical used by the tobacco plant to ward off plant - eating insects , the researchers pointed out			2
it had been used to protect crops from pests and also to control parasites in poultry			0
the scientists said it was possible the anti-mite nest protection was a happy coincidence			0
birds might only be lining their nests with discarded butts because they provide good insulation			1
further studies could reveal if this is the case by offering the birds a choice of smoked and non-smoked butts			0
either would do for insulation , but only filters from smoked cigarettes can effectively repel mites			0
' birds could distinguish smoked and non-smoked butts from their scent , just as some birds that use the chemical compounds of plants as defence against parasites appear to rely on olfaction to collect those with effective chemicals , ' the scientists wrote .			0

nicotine acts as an insecticide , while fibres provide insulation
study in @entity27 found average nest contained 10 butts
