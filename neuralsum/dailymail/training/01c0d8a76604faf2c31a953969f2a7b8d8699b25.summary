scathing : a report says @entity1 had his privacy violated during the police raid on his home sir @entity1 had his privacy violated after a secret deal between police and the @entity8 to film a raid on his house , a report says			1
the horrified pop star was left ‘ unnecessarily distressed ’ after learning police had swooped on his £ 3.5million home in @entity14 over a sex assault allegation dating from 1985 only when he saw it on tv while in @entity17			1
images were beamed live around the world last august from a camera filming from a helicopter			0
now a previously unpublished report says the deal between the @entity8 and the police should never have been done – suggesting sir @entity1 should not have been publicly humiliated in this way			1
it brands senior officials at @entity28 incompetent and calls the @entity8 dishonest for its explanation of how it came to know about the raid			1
after a @entity8 reporter approached the force , police chiefs allowed a reporting team including a camera crew to show officers searching the star ’s home			1
the coverage caused a major row , and the findings by independent investigator and former chief constable @entity44 will reignite the controversy			0
sir @entity1 has not been arrested or charged			1
but many viewers said the @entity8 coverage made the 74 - year - old singer look guilty			0
the damning report – released to the @entity50 under the @entity51 – concludes : mr @entity44 says : ‘ people have seen a search of sir @entity1 ’s apartment unfold on television with details of a serious allegation put into the public domain prior to him being interviewed by the police			1
his colleague @entity64 ( not pictured ) was invited in for a meeting with senior figures at @entity28 consequence : the deal struck between the force and the @entity8 led to detailed coverage of the raid on the complex where sir @entity1 had a flat in @entity74 , @entity14 ( pictured ) , including a news helicopter the search and the nature of the allegation ... certainly interfered with his privacy and may well have caused unnecessary distress			1
’ he concludes that had the force refused to co-operate , the @entity8 would probably never have run the story			2
although the @entity8 reporter , @entity64 , was not interviewed , mr @entity44 decided the corporation had not been fully open about how it came to hear about the allegation against sir @entity1			1
the @entity8 claim – that mr @entity64 had persuaded @entity28 to agree the deal when all he knew was the name of the celebrity suspect – was ‘ not one i believe to be credible ’ , mr @entity44 said			1
evidence supported the police account that mr @entity64 had detailed knowledge and ‘ knew as much ’ as police did when he made contact			0
the @entity8 has never revealed the source of the original information			0
up close : the footage of the raid showed several investigators entering and had images inside the house news event : but sir @entity1 , who maintains his innocence , has not been arrested or charged over the claim sir @entity1 has called the allegation that he sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in 1985 ‘ completely false ’			1
he was interviewed by police under caution and , more than six months on , inquiries are on - going			0
mr @entity44 was asked to investigate police handling of the raid by police and crime commissioner @entity117			0
analysis reveals the @entity8 journalist contacted the force ’s communications director @entity120 on july 14 after an alleged leak from @entity123 , the inquiry into abuse claims involving @entity125			2
a meeting was held the next day with mr @entity64 and detective superintendent @entity127 , who agreed to tell him the date and location of the raid in exchange for him holding the story until that day to protect the investigation			2
the chief constable was also informed of the agreement			0
mr @entity44 said miss @entity120 should not have arranged the meeting with mr @entity127 , not have confirmed any information about the inquiry to the @entity8 reporter and not have agreed to notify him of the search			2
mr @entity127 should have refused to meet or disclose any details to the @entity8			0
and chief constable @entity143 ‘ could have rescinded the agreement ’			0
a @entity28 spokesman said : ‘ while we believe our actions in relation to dealing with the media were within policy and were well intended , they were ultimately flawed and we regret the additional anxiety which was caused to sir @entity1			1
’ the @entity8 was not directly involved in mr @entity44 ’s review			2
a spokesman said : ‘ the home affairs committee has already endorsed the way the @entity8 handled this story			0
we have nothing further to add			0
’ a spokesman for sir @entity1 said he would not comment .			2

sir @entity1 first saw raid on his £ 3.5m @entity14 home on tv last august
row *prompted* police commissioner to order an independent review
it said @entity28 should never have struck deal with @entity8
@entity172 breached sir @entity1 's privacy and caused ' unnecessary distress '
sir @entity1 has not been arrested over claim he assaulted boy in 1985
police were *wrong* to confirm details of a ‘ *highly* *sensitive* and confidential ’ investigation to the @entity8 .
they should not have held a secret meeting between a senior detective and a reporter to agree an *exclusive* deal .
the force breached sir @entity1 ’s privacy by *effectively* confirming his identity as the suspect in the inquiry to other media .
