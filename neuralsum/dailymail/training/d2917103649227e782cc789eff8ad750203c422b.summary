@entity1 press secretary @entity0 found himself in a predicament on monday when reporters questioned him about vice president @entity5 's claim last friday that @entity7 and the @entity8 inadvertently armed terrorist groups in @entity9			1
asked if there was any truth @entity5 's statement , which he has since apologized for to both country 's governments , @entity0 hemmed and hawed and , at one point , stammered and gulped			1
' the reason for the vice president 's phone call was that he wanted to clarify that his recent remarks regarding the early stages of the conflict in @entity9 were not meant to imply that the @entity8 had facilitated or supported @entity22 , @entity23 or other extremist groups in @entity9 , ' @entity0 said			1
' that is what the -- th -- well -- ah -- let me just be clear , that what the president , or what the vice president did was clarify his remarks to indicate that , um , that he was attempting to imply that the @entity8 had facilitated or supported @entity22 , @entity23 or other extremist groups in @entity9 , ' he said , awkwardly pausing and changing direction at several points in the beginning of his answer			1
' the fact of the matter is , and again , the vice president noted this in his phone call with the crown prince , that the @entity8 continues to be a strong partner with the @entity61 in this effort , ' he continued , adding that the @entity1 is ' proud ' to be working with the @entity8 to defeat the @entity63			2
vice president @entity5 told what some foreign policy experts are referring to now as the cold , hard truth on friday when he called @entity7 , @entity32 , the @entity8 and other @entity67 countries out for their role in the growth of the @entity63 in @entity9 while answering a question during an event at the @entity72			1
after a student asked him if he thinks the @entity61 erred in it 's decision not to arm moderate @entity9 rebels years ago , when @entity78 administration officials including secretary of state @entity79 and secretary of defense @entity80 wanted to , @entity5 said he did not			1
in explaining his reasoning , @entity5 said : ' my constant cry was that our biggest problem is our allies — our allies in the region were our largest problem in @entity9			2
' @entity5 went on to say that ' the @entity7 were great friends , ' as were the the other countries			0
but ' they were so determined to take down @entity39 and essentially have a proxy @entity92 war ' that ' they poured hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against @entity39			0
' ' except that the people who were being supplied were @entity97 and @entity23 and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world , ' @entity5 added			0
the vice president also claimed that @entity7 president @entity103 , an old friend of his , claimed in a private conversation that his country had in fact let ' too many ' foreign fighters through			2
vice president @entity5 told students at @entity109 's @entity72 in @entity110 , @entity111 , that @entity7 and the @entity8 had a role in allowing weapons and money into @entity9 to bolster extremist groups fighting @entity9 president @entity39 @entity103 refuted @entity5 's claim over the weekend , saying that never happened , and the vice president was forced to apologize for mischaracterizing the foreign leader 's statements			1
in phone calls to @entity7 and the @entity8 leaders @entity5 also ' clarified ' that he never meant to insinuate that their countries had purposefully armed terrorists			2
but @entity5 never , in any way , suggested that the @entity126 countries had funded @entity128 extremists by design , leading reporters to wonder on monday why the @entity1 had @entity5 apologize for that comment			0
were they not true ? as @entity134 pointed out on monday morning , president @entity78 and secretary of state @entity133 had said as much themselves in recent statements			1
' the truth is that we ’ve had state actors who at times have thought that the way to advance their interests is , well , financing some of these groups as proxies is not such a bad strategy , ' @entity78 said during a press conference on august 28			2
' and part of our message to the entire region is this should be a wake - up call to @entity92 , to @entity92 — to everybody — that a group like @entity22 is beyond the pale , ' he continued			0
more recently , @entity133 told @entity153 's @entity152 , ' in the very beginning ... when the efforts to oust @entity39 took place , there were people who made calculations that the important thing is to remove @entity39			0
' and that , unfortunately , resulted in funding to different groups , and it was frankly a sloppy process			0
it did not provide the coordinated , concerted effort that was needed , ' the @entity165 official said during a sept. 24 interview			0
the difference between @entity5 's statement and that of @entity78 and @entity133 was that he named names , making it clear to important allies in the fight against @entity22 that the administration believes they are responsible for the state of affairs in @entity9			1
@entity165 spokesperson @entity178 fared slightly better than @entity0 this afternoon when asked for her agency 's reaction to @entity5 's comments			2
' we do n't have any evidence of any country supporting @entity22 , ' she said after ducking questions about the issue for a the first couple minutes of her daily briefing			0
after acknowledging that her own boss , @entity133 , had made a comment similar to @entity5 's in the not - so - distant past , @entity178 said @entity192 is ' obviously focused on moving forward , and what we can do from here			1
' ' there have been a number of steps that have been taken , even over the past couple of weeks , by a number of these countries to do more to crack down on foreign fighters and crack down on counter financing			0
' that 's where our focus is , ' she said .			0

asked if there was any truth @entity5 's statement , @entity1 press secretary @entity0 hemmed and hawed , stammered and gulped
' that is what the -- th -- well -- ah -- let me just be clear , that what the president , or what the vice president did was , ' @entity0 said at one point
@entity5 claimed last friday that @entity7 and the @entity8 inadvertently armed terrorist groups in @entity9
he has since apologized for the statement , even though president @entity78 and secretary of state @entity133 have made similar claims in the past
