by @entity0 scientists have turned to modern technology in a bid to solve a 100,000 murder mystery			2
using 3d reconstruction , they discovered that a @entity7 child , who was buried in a cave in @entity9 , suffered a blow to the head , which would likely have led to personality changes and difficulty communicating			1
the experts say that they have found the oldest traumatic brain injury in south - western @entity16 , even if they have not proved whether the head trauma proved fatal			2
using 3d reconstruction scientists discovered that a @entity7 child , who was buried in a cave in @entity9 100,000 years ago , suffered a blow to the head , which would likely have led to personality changes and difficulty communicating			1
the damaged area is marked with an arrow the 12 or 13 - year - old child received a blow to the head around 100,000 years ago			1
their skull is evidence of the oldest traumatic brain injury in south - western @entity16			2
they had a broken piece of bone depressed in their skull that was surrounded by linear fractures , as the result of a potentially violent attack			1
experts initially thought the child had a skull lesion that healed			0
but using 3d reconstruction they believe the child had brain damage			1
he or she may have experienced a change in personality as well as difficulty communicating and moving			0
using digital imaging and 3d reconstruction , scientists from @entity50 , @entity51 and the @entity52 in @entity53 , showed that the 12 or 13 - year - old had a broken piece of bone depressed in their skull that was surrounded by linear fractures , as the result of a potentially violent attack			1
experts who first examined the remains of the child , who died and was buried at @entity65 in @entity9 100,000 years ago , initially thought that the child had a skull lesion that healed			1
but by using 3d reconstruction techniques , they were able to take a fresh look at inner bone lesions to determine the serious impact that the trauma would have had on the brain			1
‘ three - dimensional imaging methods allowed us to better explore this lesion , which appeared as being a frontal bone depressed fracture , associated with brain damage , ’ they wrote in the study			1
they also estimated the brain ’s size to reconstruct what may have caused the damage			0
experts who first examined the remains of the child who died and was buried at @entity65 , @entity9 ( shown on the map ) some 100,000 years ago , initially thought that the child had a skull lesion that healed			1
but now they think that he or she suffered brain damage from the blow @entity96 is a rock shelter in the @entity98 of @entity9 near @entity99			2
the site has evidence @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 occupations , making it important in the study of early humans			0
the oldest levels are around 100,000 years old and hearths , stone tools and other artefacts have been found			2
animals bones indicate that people ate red deer and aurochs as well as snails			0
human remains from the cave include seven adults , all of which appear to have been buried purposefully			0
‘ the endocranial volume , smaller than expected for dental age , supports the hypothesis of a growth delay due to the traumatic brain injury , ’ they added			0
in doing this , the experts revealed that the type of fracture seen on the skull , usually occurs from a blow to the head , which could have been caused intentionally , but also by accident			2
whatever the cause , it is likely that the child experienced a change in personality as well as difficulty communicating and moving , according to the study , which was published in the journal @entity144			0
@entity145 , of the university , told @entity147 : ‘ digital imaging and 3d reconstruction evidenced the oldest traumatic brain injury in a palaeolithic child			1
‘ post-traumatic neuropsychological disorders could have impaired social life of this individual who was buried , when a teenager , with a special ritual raising the question of compassion in @entity159			0
’ the child ’s remains were found with two deer antlers lying on the upper chest , indicating they were buried carefully			0
‘ this young individual benefited of a unique funerary practice among the south - western @entity16 burials dated to @entity105 , ’ the scientists wrote in the study			0
they hope that closer examination of the skull , as well as others found in the cave , can provide insights into the adaptation patterns and social behaviour of early nomadic hunter - gatherers			0
it likely that the child suffered brain damage , as a result of a broken piece of bone depressed in their skull , which was surrounded by linear fractures ( pictured )			1
he or she may have experienced a change in personality as well as difficulty communicating and moving , the scientists explained			0

the skull was buried at @entity65 in @entity9 100,000 years ago
scientists in @entity196 have used digital imaging and 3d reconstruction techniques to explore the cause and impact of head trauma
they showed that the 13 - year - old had a broken piece of bone depressed in their skull that was surrounded by linear fractures
it could have been caused by a violent attack and blow to the head
impact probably caused brain damage and an altered personality
child was buried with two antlers , suggesting rituals were observed
