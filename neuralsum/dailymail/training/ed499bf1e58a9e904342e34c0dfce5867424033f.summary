@entity0 , the @entity1 player at the centre of the penalty storm that overshadowed the opening game here in @entity6 , has declared that ‘ they might as well give @entity8 the @entity9 ’ now			1
stunned by @entity12 ’s decision to award a penalty against him for what the @entity15 referee thought was a foul on @entity18 , @entity10 defender @entity0 echoed his coach , @entity19 , in tearing into the official			1
asked if he felt the referee had favoured the hosts , @entity0 - who is a reported target for @entity24 this summer - said : ‘ maybe yes , maybe no. fuming : @entity0 ( left ) has blasted @entity8 should be given the @entity9 following their opening win controversial : @entity0 ( centre ) gave away a penalty for a foul on @entity18 ( bottom ) during their @entity32 match poor display : @entity0 ( left ) has criticised referee @entity12 ( top ) for his refereeing display ‘ but if it is like this , then we can give the @entity9 directly to @entity8			1
‘ it is not just difficult for me to take , but for everyone who watched this game			2
i think it was two billion people			0
i think it is a shame			0
a big shame for this mistake			0
i can not agree with this			0
’ he continued : ‘ of course i am angry			0
i want to cry now but what can you do ? if you saw the game you saw everything so i do n't need to explain			2
‘ i was asking the referee how can you do this to us ? and then it was a shame			2
he did n't know what to say			0
the problem is that the referee does n't speak @entity57			1
‘ it is a shame that he can not explain to me or to anyone else in @entity57			1
how can any referee be in the @entity9 for that ? ’ @entity0 was supported by his central defensive partner , @entity63			1
‘ i think it is embarrassing , ’ he said			2

we should just give them the @entity9 and everyone can go home			1
’ unhappy : @entity63 ( right ) felt @entity12 gave every 50/50 decision in @entity8 's favour on thursday he too was asked if he thought the referee favoured the hosts			1
‘ everyone saw that , not just @entity1 players , ’ said @entity63			1
‘ every 50/50 decision went to @entity78 players and i think @entity79 elbowed @entity80 ( @entity81 )			1
after that he gives the penalty			2
we scored a goal , he disallowed a goal			0
because it was the opening of the @entity9 and you expect something more			1
‘ he was keen to give the penalty , it happens , it is over now			0
after that he wanted to give something to us , it was quite funny			0
i do n't think he should be allowed to referee another game			2
‘ the players are disappointed			0
but the coach said we need to think about the second game			0
i congratulate @entity8 but they did n't deserve to win today			2
language : @entity0 ( centre ) and @entity63 have both questioned @entity12 's inability to speak @entity57 ‘ i do n't blame them but i have never seen a referee in a @entity9 that does n't speak @entity57			1
it is quite , i do n't know how to say it , amazing			0
he was trying to speak to the players in @entity15			0
‘ he was speaking @entity15 but no one could understand him because we do n't have @entity15 players			0
