by @entity0 published : 19:53 est , 5 january 2014 updated : 06:27 est , 6 january 2014 veteran actor @entity4 has become ‘ deeply depressed ’ over a dispute with a neighbour at his idyllic rural retreat , his wife claimed yesterday			1
the 88 - year - old , who starred as loveable rogue @entity9 in @entity9 , is said to be sick with worry at a saw mill being built next to his home of 70 years			1
he is already fighting illness and his wife @entity15 , 75 , fears the row has made him worse			1
battle : @entity4 and his wife @entity15 have started legal action against local businessman @entity19 the couple and other villagers in @entity22 , @entity23 , have launched legal action to try to stop local businessman @entity19 , 44			1
he has started to build a metal barn 20ft high and 90ft long for his saw mill business which the district council has ruled does not need planning permission			1
mrs @entity28 blamed the dispute for an agonising skin condition and heart palpitations which she is suffering			1
she added that her doctor has prescribed valium to combat the stress			2
proposal : mr @entity19 has started to build a metal barn 20ft high for his saw mill business			1
above , his and mr @entity4 's homes in @entity22 , @entity23 ‘ this is the last thing we need			1
it has made us both unwell , ’ she said			2
‘ @entity4 has fallen and knocked himself and he is on hefty medication for other health problems			1
this is shaking what he values			2
‘ he has always been very quiet and needs peace and quiet			2
otherwise he would n’t have lived here for 70 years			2
‘ this is our safe place and suddenly it is n’t any more			2
we ca n’t get away from it			2
our master bedroom and sitting area face towards it			0
‘ at our age , we do not socialise except with our children and grandchildren			0
we never go away – we are always here			0
’ protesters said beautiful trees will be hacked down , the mill will be an eyesore and noisy machinery will ruin the rural peace			1
mr @entity19 runs a saw mill business two miles away in @entity64 and lives yards from the @entity66			1
he said he needs the machinery in the barn at his home to chop up trees			0
but mrs @entity28 said : ‘ the building looks like an escapee from an industrial estate			0
the problem is the planning department did n’t realise it would be quite so obtrusive and out of place			0
‘ it does n’t nestle in the side of the hill and he has built on the plateau it stands on , so it is visible from every angle from the open lane			0
’ the couple have taken on law firm @entity85 to challenge @entity23 council ’s decision that the building does not need planning permission			0
the firm said the ruling was ‘ deeply flawed and unlawful ’			2
concern : mr @entity4 , who starred as loveable rogue @entity9 in @entity9 ( above ) , is said to be sick with worry not well : the veteran actor , pictured with @entity15 , 75 , is already fighting illness and taking a range of medication a spokesman added : ‘ the council made a gross error in failing to protect our clients ’ residential amenity in allowing the saw mill to begin with			1
‘ in so doing , it failed to have any regard to the noise implications of the proposal			0
’ the @entity66 and other neighbours are backed by planning consultant @entity111 , who has lodged an objection with the authority			0
but a council spokesman said : ‘ a forestry building has been allowed on the site on the basis that it falls within permitted development rights			0
‘ the council was satisfied that the proposed siting , design and external appearance of the building was acceptable			0
’ mrs @entity28 added : ‘ we are having a bit of a struggle but we are putting our faith in the council and they said they would investigate			0
’ her husband of 49 years has appeared in countless films and tv series in a career spanning more than six decades			0
