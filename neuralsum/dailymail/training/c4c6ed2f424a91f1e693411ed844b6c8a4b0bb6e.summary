by @entity0 for @entity1 the @entity2 were left red - faced after it was revealed sensitive information relating to criminal investigations had been publicly available for a number of years on parliamentary websites			1
specific information relating to the targets of investigations , the reason why they were being monitored , their communications , addresses and names of @entity2 officers not known to the public were some of the details published , according to @entity19			1
it comes as the @entity2 and @entity21 look to drum up support for a data retention policy that would require telecommunications companies to keep a record of what customers did on phones and the internet for two years			1
this data would be used by @entity32 law enforcement , anti-corruption and national security agencies to investigate crimes without a warrant			0
the information was released as part of an answer to a parliamentary question on notice			2
the spokesman told @entity1 they took these types of breaches ' very seriously ' and had put into place steps to fix the problem after they had reported it themselves to the @entity32 privacy commissioner			0
he said the @entity2 had also apologised to those who had been affected by the breach			2
targets of investigations , why they were being monitored , their communications , addresses and names of @entity2 officers not known to the public were some of the details published according to the spokesman , the details were ' hidden behind electronic redactions within the document ' but ' one phone number and an address could , under certain circumstances , be accessed '			1
this is the latest in a series of blunders that have raised questions over the government 's proposed data retention policy			1
most notably were prime minister @entity81 and attorney - general @entity82 unable to clarify what data would be covered under the policy			2
in a @entity87 interview earlier this month , mr @entity82 was repeatedly asked to clarify what information would actually be captured			0
' what you 're viewing on the internet is not what we 're interested in ... what the security agencies want to know , to be retained , is the electronic address of the website that the web user is visiting , ' he said			0
but then mr @entity82 went onto to admit the data collected under the proposal would include the website			0
after clarification , he explained that the sites visited by a browser would be retained , but not the content that was viewed on the site .			0

it comes as the government looks at *introducing* a data retention policy
the information was on parliamentary sites for a number of years
@entity116 included phone numbers , addresses and names of @entity2 officers not known to the public
the @entity2 were alerted to the breach on august 27 and they have since apologised to the affected parties
