by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:48 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 04:51 est , 19 december 2013 they are arguably some of the most famous faces in the country			0
but clearly someone thought these two policemen needed a who 's who of the royal family - and provided them with a gallery of pictures so they could double check the people attending the @entity15 's pre-christmas lunch were invited			1
despite the high - profile guests , it looked - like a decision had been taken to keep the checks low - key and a paper sheet was being used for monitoring who was entering the @entity22			1
the method of checking off members of the royal family on a paper copy is reminiscent of bouncers turning away partygoers at a nightclub			1
if your name 's not down , you 're not coming in : two officers check to see who has made it for the @entity36 lunch a policeman checks is crib sheet for the @entity39 as they arrive at the @entity15 's @entity36 lunch at @entity22 for her extended family the esteemed members of her majesty 's family descended en masse to @entity22 for a festive feast this afternoon			1
. it 's a rare occasion which sees the entire royal family gathered around the table			1
only twice a year does the @entity15 summon the entire extended @entity39 to the @entity22 for her pre-christmas dinner			1
and while some would expect the distinguished guests to arrive in expensive cars driven by chauffeurs , @entity50 and his daughter took a far more humble approach to their mode of transport			2
the beaming pair arrived in a tiny blue @entity60 500 , with a pair of dice dangling from the rear view mirror			1
prince @entity64 drove his wife @entity65 in for the dinner , but there was no sign of their only son @entity69 @entity65 looked fresh - faced and rosy - cheeked as she arrived for the annual @entity36 dinner for the @entity15 's extended family cheer up @entity64 , you 're about to have @entity36 dinner ! the @entity64 and @entity75 drove to the feast , but the baby seat in the back of the car appeared empty prince @entity64 was all ears when @entity75 spoke to him as they drove to the central @entity83 palace they were joined by other members of the royal family including prince @entity64 and @entity65 , @entity75 , prince @entity87 and @entity88			1
@entity75 wore a festive red coat while her husband , the second in line to the throne , looked smart in a blue suit and glasses as he drove them into @entity22			2
however , there was no sign of the couple 's son , @entity69 , who is third in line to the throne			0
but a baby - seat could be seen strapped into the back seat 's chair behind prince @entity64			2
@entity15 , who appeared to be wearing a peach jacket and a string of pearls , could be seen peering out of the window as she was driven into the palace			2
the @entity15 was driven in by a chauffeur before she greeted her extended family for the meal @entity88 looked all smiles as she was joined by her husband @entity87 for the @entity36 lunch at @entity22 she will be dining with @entity117 , princess @entity118 and @entity119 , the @entity120 , along with other members of her large extended family			1
crowds braved the rain to line the path of the @entity126 in @entity83 to greet the royal family , which included both immediate and extended relatives f the @entity15			1
while everyone else drove in and waved to the crowds from their seats , prince @entity0 chose a far more subtle approach to arriving - strolling in on foot in his wax jacket from the direction of @entity138			1
the prince , who arrived an hour early , barely caught the attention of the crowds			2
another pedestrian was vice admiral sir @entity143 , the second husband of @entity144			0
while @entity64 and @entity75 drove themselves to the lunch , it was a far cry from their latest ' official engagements ' car			0
prince @entity64 has recently added a Â £ 250,000 @entity151 to his garages is likely to make him the envy of many fathers - to - be up and down the country			0
the @entity156 , which the @entity157 and @entity75 will use for high - profile official engagements , is one of the worldâ € ™ s fastest saloon cars with a top speed of 200mph			0
@entity50 and daughter @entity163 were all smiles as they made a grand entrance in a tiny @entity167 a far more environmentally friendly way to travel : prince @entity117 arrived on foot , as did vice admiral sir @entity170 safety features include bullet - proof windows and super-hardened steel armour , contributing to its hefty three - ton weight			1
one member of the family who was absent from today 's festivities is prince @entity179			2
the 29 - year - old @entity180 showed off his bushy facial hair during a tour of a @entity184 research centre shortly before departing for the @entity185			0
prince @entity179 returns to @entity185 after finishing walking with the wounded 's @entity186 , which saw him join a team of injured service personnel from the @entity185 and two others from the @entity192 and the @entity193 , for a charity trek across @entity195			0
princess @entity118 was driven in like most of the other guests , but @entity117 braved the rain to arrive on foot for the special meal the @entity64 and princess @entity200 were among the guests who got into the @entity36 spirit today @entity144 , the princess royal , looked all wrapped up in her car and wasbe joined by her relative the @entity120 at the occasion lady @entity206 ( right ) glowed while @entity207 ( left ) looked serious - perhaps because she had seen the tiny car her husband had used to drive in @entity210 , the wife of @entity211 , who is the son of @entity144 , princess royal , also chose to sport a red outfit to the occasion while @entity214 , the only daughter of the 1st @entity215 and @entity216 , chose a dark blue ensemble @entity218 , ( left ) the daughter of the @entity64 and princess @entity200 , looked fresh - faced , while @entity211 looked stern upon arriving while prince @entity87 was probably expecting his photograph to be taken when he arrived at the @entity22 , he was n't expecting it when a youngster asked him for a snap yesterday			1
the schoolboy took a selfie of himself with prince @entity87 after he asked the @entity180 for a picture during a visit to a church centre			0
the young boy took the picture before security staff could intervene after he asked the @entity64 if he could take a photo			0
the boy , a member of the @entity235 , in @entity236 , @entity237 , took the opportunity to ask for a picture while prince @entity87 was chatting to the congregation yesterday			0
he said : ' i went up to him and said if i could take a photograph of him - and then well i did n't wait for the body guards to push me out of the way , i just took a picture			0
' prince @entity87 , who was wearing a navy blue suit and checked tie , is seen standing behind the boy , looking into the camera			0
say cheese ! the young boy took the picture before security staff could intervene after he asked the @entity64 if he could take a photo			0
