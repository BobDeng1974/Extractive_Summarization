@entity0 may be the @entity2 's presidential front - runner , but the former secretary of state 's poll numbers do n't make her look the part			1
her ' favorable ' rating – a measure of how many @entity8 see her in a positive light – is now ' under water , ' meaning that she has fewer fans than detractors			0
a @entity15 poll released thursday found that just 26 per cent see her favorably , compared with 37 per cent who do n't			1
the rest , about one - third of those polled , have n't made up their minds			0
barely half of @entity2 , though – just 55 per cent – say they hold favorable views of her			0
that number is down 8 points since november 2013			2
across the entire voting spectrum , @entity27 has lost 12 points of support in the intervening 16 months			1
her high - water mark in the @entity15 poll came just two months after she took over the @entity52 in early 2009 , when 58 per cent of @entity8 said they liked her			1
but the wheels fell off shortly after she left the @entity56 administration : when her memoir ' @entity38 ' his bookshelves , her favorability number bottomed out at 24 per cent			0
the most recent survey , conducted march 21 - 24 , shows she 's barely rebounded since then			0
@entity62 : a deep field of republicans including @entity71 gov. @entity70 ( left ) , former @entity64 gov. @entity63 ( center ) and @entity67 sen. @entity66 ( right ) is chomping at the bit and waiting for a chance to attack @entity27 there 's bad news also for @entity27 - backers who hope her ' email-gate ' scandal has only temporarily poisoned the public perceptions			1
two - thirds of those surveyed said the brewing scandal had no impact on their opinion , giving her precious little ground to make up even if the controversy fades			1
in addition to @entity27 's use of a private , unaudited email server for all her messages while she was the @entity56 administration 's top diplomat , she continues to be dogged by accusations that her family foundation accepted millions of dollars from foreign governments during the same timeframe			0
@entity15 pollsters did not ask whether that embarrassing news had an impact on how @entity8 see her			2
but her responses to the email kerfuffle have produced mixed results			0
@entity8 appear evenly divided over whether @entity27 's explanations satisfied their concerns			2
forty - two per cent said yes , while 40 per cent said no. @entity107 : some part of voters ' negative impressions of mrs. @entity0 may harken back to her time as first lady thirty - eight per cent said they believe @entity27 kept the @entity52 out of the loop on her emails principally to shield work - related communications from the public			1
forty - nine percent believed her claim that she did it out of ' convenience			0
' on balance , @entity27 's biggest hurdle may be her own words , stretching back into the 1990s when she was @entity8 's first lady			2
forty - seven per cent of the people @entity15 polled said they do n't believe she is ' honest and trustworthy ' – 5 per cent more than the number who came down on mrs. @entity0 's side			1
@entity0 email poll topline 3/26/15 by @entity130			0

@entity15 poll found the @entity2 presidential front - runner has lost 12 percentage points of support since november 2013
thirty - seven per cent of @entity8 say they see @entity27 unfavorably ; just 26 per cent have a positive view
forty - seven per cent say she 's not ' honest and trustworthy ' – 5 per cent more than the number who *disagree*
numbers look bad despite two - thirds saying ' email-gate ' scandal has had no impact on their opinion of the former secretary of state
