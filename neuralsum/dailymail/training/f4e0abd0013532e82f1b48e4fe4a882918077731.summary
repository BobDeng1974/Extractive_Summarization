@entity0 once likened @entity1 to the @entity2			0
some of the articles about @entity4 , the @entity5 test driver of all things , have been only moderately less gushing			1
she has been described by the @entity8 as the fastest woman in the world			1
the writer of that phrase may have taken her lead from a documentary of the same name about @entity4			1
that documentary was made by @entity17 , who just happens to be @entity4 's brother			1
i do not know @entity4 at all			1
a friend of mine is a friend of hers and i am assured she is a nice woman			2
but it would be idle to deny that the hype has overtaken the reality in the projection of her as a future @entity29 race driver			2
the evidence simply does not support the notion			0
to suggest otherwise is not only an insult to people 's intelligence but to several drivers of greater promise			0
dressed for success : @entity4 , the @entity5 development driver , poses for a fashion shoot behind the wheel : @entity4 during testing for @entity5 at @entity41 , the home of the @entity42 @entity29 a few facts			1
she is not the fastest woman in the world			1
@entity46 is way ahead of her			1
@entity48 's victory in the @entity49 is the only win by a woman in @entity53 history and her third place at the @entity55 is he best finish by a woman			2
@entity4 has never won a race in a car , as opposed to a kart			1
in @entity62 she has finished the season in 17th , 20th , 18th , 16th and 13th places and twice been not classified			0
she competed in @entity64 and @entity65 for five years without any particular distinction			0
by contrast , @entity67 , another @entity42 , finished second in the @entity69 , second in @entity70 and third in @entity72 , yet he is racing in sports cars after failing to cut the mustard in @entity29 testing			1
why then is @entity5 ' test driver ? could it be anything to do with the fact her husband , @entity80 , became a director there in 2009 ? surely not			1
( in passing , how can mr @entity80 be a shareholder at @entity5 and executive director at @entity87 ? ) despite her lack of experience in an @entity29 car – one straight - line test and day in the young driver test at @entity41 last year – @entity4 , 31 , continues to make her case for a race seat and will , ludicrously , drive in practice sessions during grands prix weekends at @entity41 and @entity98 this season			1
' i focus on performance because once i put my helmet on it does n't matter what i look like , ' she said recently			0
' if i do n't perform i 'm out			0
' i 'm not on a crusade to prove women deserve to be here			0
i 'm on a crusade for @entity4			1
i just want to be the best racing driver i can be			2
if i can break down barriers as well as help people , i will			0
' i wish her luck			0
i merely register my belief that the @entity4 story is primarily a publicity stunt			1
missing out : @entity116 @entity67 has been overlooked by @entity29 teams one or the other ? @entity4 poses with fashion accessories on her @entity119 chequered flag : but it is debatable whether @entity4 deserves her place those of us who believe in the rule of law – as opposed to anarchy – respect the @entity128 's role as the policemen of @entity29			2
so logic says we should hail the judges ' decision to reject @entity134 's appeal against @entity136 's expulsion from the @entity137 @entity29 and instead support the @entity128 's right to determine what the rules are			2
but i am not sure it is as simple as that			0
@entity134 claim , quite convincingly i think , that the @entity128 's fuel sensor was unreliable and that they , in fact , were not breaking the fuel - flow limits			1
the @entity128 's authority surely depends on their enforcing the law fairly and correctly			0
otherwise what legitimacy do they have ? unlucky : @entity134 had a case with @entity136 's appeal seeing @entity154 's de facto team principal @entity153 piling suitcases full of car parts nose high on several airport trollies this weekend reminded me of a nickname given to his predecessor , @entity160			1
@entity162 , then the @entity128 president , disparaged @entity160 as ' the bag carrier ' , for supposedly lugging around @entity166 's briefcase			2
speaking of @entity160 , i understand he is still in the process of agreeing his severance package			1
it is likely to be around £ 6million , a quarter of a million for each of the 24 years he was at @entity154			2
factoring in that his final salary at @entity154 was £ 2.5m , that 's quite some compensation for @entity162 's cutting remark			2
pay - day : former @entity154 chief @entity160 is likely to receive a pay - off of around £ 6million seeing as the smog in @entity178 is in your face – not to mention possibly creeping into one 's lungs – it would seem a somewhat futile exercise to blank out coverage of the problem			1
yet type ' @entity178 ' and ' smog ' into @entity189 over here and it is hit and miss whether the related stories are accessible			0
on thursday , next to none would open up			0
is this some form of half - baked censorship ? that suspicion would be abated if the ' official ' figures measuring the micrograms per cubic metre were not markedly lower than those issued by the @entity201 @entity200			2
whatever the criteria , there is a gas mask in my hotel room			0
difficult to breathe : the smog in @entity178 has hardly been mentioned by officials mercedes are wary of having their image tarnished by association if @entity213 's criminal trial , which starts in @entity214 next week , should find him guilty of bribery			1
they cite ' compliance ' , referring to a @entity219 law about probity in company affairs			0
why then potentially damage their own reputation by covering up the fact they tried to get @entity134 banned for three races over @entity136 's fuel - flow irregularity ? twice they denied arguing for that draconian punishment , only for me to see in black and white that they had repeatedly done so in a 95 - page submission to the court			1
this , we note , is a team that banned me from their motorhome when i wrote what was perceived as an unflattering article about @entity241 , in which i revealed that his aide - de - camp , @entity242 , was once convicted of fraud			2
i am still partially banned : i can go into the motorhome and to general press conferences but not to @entity241 's @entity247 briefings			0
i take this in good spirit			0
i remember the jest of @entity251 , the world 's greatest gossip columnist			0
' writs , dear boy , are the @entity255 of our business , ' he said			0
@entity258 , i tell myself , are not far behind .			0

@entity4 is the @entity5 test driver who will drive in practice sessions at the @entity42 and @entity214 @entity262
@entity4 is not the fastest woman in the world - @entity46 is ahead of her
@entity160 will agree a severance package of around £ *6milllion*
mercedes have tried to cover up their *pursuit* to get @entity134 banned
