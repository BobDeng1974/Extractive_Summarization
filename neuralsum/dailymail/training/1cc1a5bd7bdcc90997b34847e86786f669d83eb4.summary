he became a tetraplegic after breaking his neck in a riding accident in 1995 and went on to raise thousands of pounds for spinal research			2
however , it was the father of two ’s unwitting role in @entity88 ’s disappearance in 1974 that created all the headlines			2
on the night that nanny @entity129 was bludgeoned to death in the @entity132 ’s family home in @entity134 ’s @entity133 , the peer tried to contact @entity102			2

but @entity94 showed unswerving loyalty and moved back in after his fall and set about restoring her husband to health			0
@entity169 proved an equally determined nurse and the two women — reputed to have met for the first time when they stood either side of the trolley that took @entity102 to intensive care — agreed to separate visiting hours			0

‘ she was looking for a small gift because she ’d already bought him a massive thing , ’ owner @entity220 tells me			0
‘ she just needed something to give him to play with			0
’ happily , @entity143 was more impressed with @entity213 ’s gift than the cuddly toy bilby he was given in @entity229 in april , which he threw away within seconds			0
why @entity232 is no. 2 at home , too given that their sons are named @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 , there was never much doubt as to who wore the trousers in @entity232 ’s household			0
