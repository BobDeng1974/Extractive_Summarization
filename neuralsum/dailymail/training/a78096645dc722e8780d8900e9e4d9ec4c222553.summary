by @entity0 it 's one of those first world problems that can annoy people on a daily basis			0
having to wait for a drink to cool down , or sipping it after it has already gone cold , can ruin a perfectly good cup of tea			0
after suffering one too many scalding beverages , one inventor has launched a mug that keeps drinks at a perfect temperature			2
the container then uses this heat to keep the temperature at a comfortable level for up to three hours			1
it is maintained at a temperature of 55 ° c , which enables someone to sip their drink without scalding themselves			1
the technology inside the insulation of the device , called the @entity45 , is made of a waxy substance which melts to preserve the right heat level			1
the gadget has been created with a special layer of insulating material inside that draws away any excess heat from boiling hot drinks			1
the container then uses this heat to keep the temperature at a comfortable level for up to three hours			2
the technology inside the insulation of the device , called the @entity45 , is made of a waxy substance which melts to preserve the right heat level			2
it is maintained at a temperature of 55 ° c , which enables someone to sip their drink without scalding themselves			1
it was designed by @entity66 , who created a prototype and launched the idea on crowdfunding website @entity69 , where he has raised almost than £ 112,000 towards the manufacturing process			2
the flasks are expected to go on sale for around £ 20 in july next year			2
mr @entity66 , 53 , an industrial designer from @entity74 , said : ' this project was born of my frustration with my coffee being too hot to drink after i made it			1
' then , it would get cold too quickly			0
i wanted it to be just right for a long time			0
' i knew about the physics of phase change and realised it could be used to moderate my coffee 's temperature simply and automatically			0
the mug was designed by @entity66 ( pictured ) , who became frustrated when every drink he made was too hot to drink for a while and then became cold quickly ' it 's like a normal insulated mug , but it has an extra layer of insulation which extracts the excess heat from your coffee , stores it , and then uses it later to keep a drink just right			1
' the @entity45 insulation is a phase change material which melts at the temperature you want your coffee to be at			0
' it 's a pure , wax - like substance which is perfectly safe and sealed in a stainless steel envelope			0
' it needs no external power from batteries or cords , it just uses the heat of the coffee			0
' the @entity45 is best used with any drink that is too hot right after preparation , coffee , tea , soup , and cocoa for example			0
' this mug has a hold temperature of about 55 ° c , and the coffee stays at a comfortable drinking temperature for about three hours			1

a wax inside the mug draws away any excess heat from the hot drink
this heat is then used to maintain its temperature at 55 ° c for three hours
the device , created by @entity66 , will go on sale in july next year
