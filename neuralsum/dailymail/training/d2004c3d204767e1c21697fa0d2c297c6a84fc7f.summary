by @entity1 reporter published : 07:42 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 20:47 est , 22 august 2012 at 7.30pm , @entity2 put her three - year - old daughter to bed with a slight temperature			2
just before midnight , @entity7 woke up and asked for a drink			1
if she had n’t , she would not be alive today			2
mrs @entity2 noticed the little girl ’s temperature had soared and there were purple blotches all over her body			2
@entity14 and @entity2 with their daughter @entity7 who is recovering from meningitis @entity7 at 5am on january 29th , five hours after they got to hospital ( left ) the purple marks quickly spread ( right ) she and her husband @entity14 immediately performed one of the key tests for meningitis – pressing a clear glass against the skin to see if the rash fades under pressure			1
it did not , so the couple from @entity31 bundled @entity7 into the family car and drove her straight to hospital			1
doctors diagnosed meningococcal septicaemia and said she might have only three hours to live			1
both of her legs went black and she was placed in intensive care with bandaged limbs and drips keeping her alive			2
amazingly she pulled through , and is now firmly on the road to recovery after months of hospital treatment			2
mrs @entity2 kept a remarkable photo diary of her daughter ’s brush with death and has made it public to raise awareness of how quickly meningitis can take hold			1
fortunately doctors were able to save her legs recovery : @entity7 on february 24th ( left )			1
she is now re-learning how to walk ( right ) it was in january that @entity7 complained of feeling poorly and her mother put it down to a stomach bug			1
by the time @entity7 went to bed she was feeling better and looked fine			1
yet when she woke up four hours later she complained that she could not move			1
‘ i took the quilt off her and saw the purple marks , ’ said her mother , who has seven other children			2
‘ me and my husband did the glass test and then rushed to hospital			1
not ringing and waiting for an ambulance was the best thing we could have done			2
‘ you have to get to the hospital quickly and getting there in ten minutes made a difference			0
‘ it happened so quickly , we did n’t have time to think			0
i was terrified as there was nothing i could do			0
every time someone touched her she screamed			0
@entity7 , 3 , was just three hours from death after she contracted meningitis ' there were so many doctors and medical staff in the room at the hospital			1
i was in shock but surrounded by my family			0
‘ @entity7 was screaming and i felt helpless			1
i just had to sit there and watch and as a parent that is the worst thing that can happen			0
’ later that night @entity7 was transferred from @entity93 to the intensive care unit at @entity97 ’s @entity96 legs went black as the septicaemia ate away at her flesh , exposing the bone			1
‘ we expected her to just go on to a drip but we did n’t expect her to go into intensive care , ’ said mrs @entity2			0
‘ it was the septicaemia which made it so much worse			0
‘ @entity7 was screaming all the time			1
i was a mess when the surgeon said she might have to have both legs amputated			0
‘ that was a last resort but it was definitely a possibility			0
both her legs and her right hand were completely black			0
’ @entity7 was transferred to a specialist burns unit as the effect on her limbs was similar to severe burns , and she underwent skin grafts			1
amputation was prevented by ‘ vacuum therapy ’ , which encouraged the tissue to cover the bone			0
mrs @entity2 added : ‘ the @entity122 have been fantastic			0
they told us everything that was happening			0
‘ @entity7 is so bubbly and intelligent			1
she kept saying , “ one day i will walk again , @entity125 ” and we stayed really positive throughout the whole situation			0
‘ she understands that she has been poorly but she has her appetite back now			0
she is a bit unsteady on her feet and will need splints to walk properly			0
’ @entity7 spent two weeks in hospital and has since returned three times for skin graft operations			1
but less than eight months after being struck down by the illness , she is due to start nursery next month			0
‘ if it was n’t for the glass test then we would n’t have known what was wrong , ’ said her mother			2
‘ i do n’t know what would have happened if she had n’t called out for a drink that evening			2

@entity7 would have died if she had *n't* called out for a glass of water in the night she fell ill
doctors tell her parents she had been just three hours from death
