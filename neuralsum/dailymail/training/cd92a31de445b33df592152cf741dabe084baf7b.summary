@entity0 advanced to the quarter - finals of the @entity2 with a hard - fought victory over big - hitting @entity4			1
the 2011 champion was almost faultless for most of the first set but the wheels came off in the tie - break as @entity4 took the initiative			2
@entity0 produced the only break of the match to take the second , but the third went to another tie - break and the eighth seed made his class count as he closed out the match 6 - 7 ( 3/7 ) 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 7/2 )			1
close call : @entity0 saved two match points to beat @entity4 6 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 in @entity2 on the mend : @entity0 is still searching for his first title of the year following back surgery the duo largely cancelled each other out in the first set , with @entity4 's big forehand return causing plenty of problems for @entity0 , but the @entity28 was easily out - classing his opponent at the net			1
@entity4 was making the early errors , finding the net every time @entity0 brought him short , but he produced a stunning backhand volley to win the fourth game			1
the rest of the set went with serve and @entity0 secured a mini-break on just the second point before moving 3 - 1 ahead			1
but @entity4 came roaring back , his big returns proving unplayable off @entity0 's second serve , and took the tie - break 7 - 3			1
the world number nine could have been forgiven for being shellshocked , but he delivered the perfect response by breaking @entity4 in the first game of the second set			2
@entity0 had two break points but @entity4 fought back before eventually succumbing to the first break of the match			1
the rest of the set went with serve , with @entity0 keeping his opponent at bay with little trouble as he closed it out			2
that pattern continued until the @entity54 double - faulted in the 11th game of the third to hand @entity4 match point , but once again his volleying let him down as he found the net			2
small margins : last year 's runner - up @entity4 only lost his serve once during the close defeat @entity0 saw off another match point at 40 - 40 , but then produced a sublime winner and an ace to take the game to a deciding tie - break			1
and the former @entity69 and @entity70 champion proved too strong as two good returns forced @entity4 to find the net			1
the @entity74 11th seed finished things off with a double fault			0

' it 's all about winning right now , i do n't really care how i play , i just try and keep getting wins			0
' next up ? @entity0 could face former world no 1 @entity91 in the quarter - finals @entity0 was also full of praise for his opponent , whose big serve had caused the 27 - year - old problems all match			1
' he has the best serve , ' he added			0
' he serves huge first serves and the difference between him and the other guys is the second serve			0
' her serves quite a lot of second - serve aces , he gets good work on the second serve			0
