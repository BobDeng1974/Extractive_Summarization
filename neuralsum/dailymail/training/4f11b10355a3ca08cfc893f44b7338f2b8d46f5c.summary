by @entity0 , political editor published : 09:59 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 20:44 est , 5 march 2014 the cabinet secretary has been asked to investigate a string of unanswered questions over @entity6 ’s handling of the child porn arrest and resignation of one of @entity11 ’s closest aides			2
@entity13 ’s shadow cabinet minister , @entity12 , asked sir @entity14 whether aide @entity15 was given advance notice that police were being called in			1
he also demanded to know if it was right for a previous complaint against mr @entity15 to be handled by the prime minister ’s chief of staff @entity21 – a friend of both mr @entity11 and mr @entity15			1
cabinet secretary sir @entity14 ( left ) has been asked by @entity13 to investigate why the child porn arrest of @entity15 ( right ) was not made public @entity6 has been accused of a cover - up after mr @entity15 , deputy director of the no 10 policy unit , was arrested over suspected child pornography offences on february 13			1
no 10 failed to disclose that he had resigned until confronted by the @entity29 earlier this week			1
mr @entity11 ’s aides insist it would be been wrong to have made the affair public before the police , though the @entity34 , which was called in to @entity6 , is still refusing to comment			0
@entity35 suggest no 10 has failed to satisfy ‘ a number of important questions ’ , including the sequence of events that saw mr @entity15 resign before being arrested early the next day			1
in a letter to cabinet secretary sir @entity14 , mr @entity12 asked when @entity6 was first made aware of the allegations , at what point mr @entity15 was spoken to , when police were alerted and precisely when mr @entity15 resigned			1
it also emerged that mr @entity15 , 62 , who has been close to mr @entity11 for decades since they worked together as young advisers at the @entity48 , had previously been accused of sexual harassment by a woman civil servant			1
prime minister @entity11 has said he is ' profoundly shocked ' by the arrest of his old friend the complaint was made to @entity21 , mr @entity11 ’s chief of staff , and it is understood that the prime minister was also informed			0
@entity6 sources say the complaint was in no way related to the allegations involving child abuse images and had been ‘ appropriately settled ’			0
the move of the complainant to another government department was also unconnected to the incident , they insist			0
mr @entity12 asked sir @entity14 exactly how much mr @entity11 had known of the previous complaint , and whether it was right for it to be handled by mr @entity21 , given his friendship with mr @entity15			2
the two men both worked for @entity68 , now head of the @entity69 , when he was a @entity70 commissioner			0
mr @entity12 said : ‘ i understand that @entity6 has a duty of care to mr @entity15			2
however , there seems to be a number of very basic and serious questions which need answering because he was a very senior figure in @entity11 ’s office			0
’ questions : there are several aspects of the case which have been left unanswered by @entity82 @entity6 said sir @entity14 would respond in due course but that it was satisfied the previous grievance and the arrest and resignation had been properly handled			0
however it added that it could not answer some of the questions because of the potential for prejudicing an ongoing investigation			0
mr @entity15 was brought in to @entity6 as deputy head of policy in 2011 , and was involved in drawing up @entity93 policy on tackling online child abuse images			2
mr @entity11 said he was ‘ profoundly shocked ’ by the allegations			0
mr @entity15 , who is unmarried and lives in west @entity96 , has not been charged with any offence and has not commented on his arrest			1

@entity15 resigned and was arrested nearly three weeks *ago*
but @entity104 only *confirmed* it after being questioned by the @entity29 on *monday*
it also emerged that he was accused of sexual harassment by a *colleague*
officials face quiz as to why @entity15 was allowed to resign before his arrest
