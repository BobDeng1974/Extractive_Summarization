by @entity0 the world ’s first sensory restaurant for babies , which aims to encourage healthy eating from a young age , has opened its doors today			1
with the aim of helping mothers and fathers introduce their little ones to healthy eating habits early on , the @entity7 aims to help families make mealtimes fun through sensory play and expert advice			1
the restaurant in @entity18 features a dedicated sensory area where mini diners are encouraged to play and explore before taking their seats to tuck in			1
' letting them see , touch and smell the food will make them feel involved and in return they will be more likely to try new tastes			0
' babies are then encouraged to try new flavours , in order to encourage them to discover and accept new foods and tastes , in the ' taste zone '			2
little ones will be seated in highchairs at interactive tables , from which they will be able to choose from their very own digital menu , allowing them to select their own mains and desserts			1
creators say that the colourful interactive menu features state - of - the - art technology , designed to be ideal for little fingers to tap and touch			1
opening up : the @entity7 restaurant , as it 's called , is located in @entity18 and aims to help little diners explore their tastebuds in an interactive way playtime : little diners will explore a variety of dedicated sensory areas , before finishing their sensory restaurant journey in the ' taste zone ' , where they can order using an interactive menu ' the interactive menu is another great way of generating that important sensory engagement , by using visuals of fruit and vegetables to introduce babies to the ingredients they are about to munch on			1
' they are able to look at colours and shapes and engage their senses visually , which will make them more excited about new shapes , textures and foods they try , ' said @entity94			0
depending on the number of times they tap a particular food icon over a 30 - second period , the digital menu responds accordingly and the waiters bring the children their selected choice of food , which has been developed with advice from child nutritionists			2
speaking about the new restaurant , @entity94 , who worked on the menu , added : ' we understand that mums and dads sometimes find mealtimes tricky , and that it can take quite a few tries to familiarise any hungry little ones with a new taste or texture			0
' we also know that by introducing little ones ’ taste buds to a wide variety of different and exciting tastes , it can help encourage them to grow up to be good little eaters			2
' that ’s why it ’s super important to try to introduce little ones to new foods , especially savoury vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower , every day during the first weeks of weaning			0
how does it work ? ' if you can involve your little ones in the food preparation process , such as giving them veggies and fruits to play with , it will make them more engaged from the start , ' explained @entity39 ' we hope our sensory restaurant encourages lots of little ones to try tastes and textures they may not have experienced before , and gives parents plenty of ideas and suggestions for fun ways to excite little ones ’ senses and make mealtimes fun at home			2
' @entity157 , @entity158 and founder of @entity24 , who are behind the restaurant , said : ' since i set up @entity24 , our mission has been to help create healthy relationships with food for little ones			0
' the very first tastes babies try when starting out on the weaning journey are so important , so it ’s our aim to make this experience as easy and enjoyable as possible for both parents and little ones			0
' that ’s why we ’re delighted to open this innovative weeny weaning restaurant , which helps babies get used to trying lots of delicious new flavours in a really fun , sensorial way			0
