last night parents and teachers reacted angrily to the suspensions			0
‘ this child went completely berserk and was likely to cause injury , ’ said one member of staff			1
' if he had injured anyone then the brickbats would have been out and questions would have been asked over why they had not put him in a secure room			2
it ’s not good enough			0
' teachers are afforded no protection from violence and when they are assertive and use common sense this happens			0
’ the incident happened shortly before half - term at the 442 - pupil @entity49 in @entity51			1
the school has a special education unit which deals with children with behavioural problems from across the borough			2

i have received a telephone call from the education authority threatening me that if i speak to anyone i will be disciplined , which is a bit ironic			0
so i am not willing to speak to anyone			0
