by @entity0 last updated at 1:40 am on 28th february 2012 a vulnerable patient was bitten by a rat more than a dozen times as he lay sedated in an @entity5 residential hospital			1
nurses only realised what had happened when @entity8 stumbled down the corridor with the rodent hanging from his neck by its teeth			1
they dislodged the creature and killed it , but mr @entity8 was left with about 12 deep puncture wounds where he had been badly bitten on his shoulder and neck			1
vulnerable : @entity8 , 42 , was left with painful injuries after being bitten by the rodent more than a dozen times on his back and neck as he lay sedated in his hospital bed horrifying : hospital staff only discovered what was happening when mr @entity8 , who has a mental age of two , was spotted stumbling around a corridor with the rat hanging from his neck by its teeth when his parents called to check on him , they were told that the 42 - year - old , who has learning difficulties , bipolar disorder and a mental age of two , had been bitten by a rat , although the hospital now insists it was a field mouse			1
but his mother @entity39 , 63 , said : ‘ as soon as i saw the bites i knew it had to have been a rat			1
‘ they were deep teeth puncture marks all over his shoulder			2
i could n’t believe that there were rats running free in an @entity5 hospital			2
‘ he was heavily sedated when it happened , so @entity52 knows how long the rat was gnawing him			1
it must have been in his bed			2
’ mr @entity8 was attacked after going to bed for the night at a specialist care unit at @entity58 ’s hospital in @entity59 , @entity60 , on november 20 last year			1
he was taken to @entity61 the following day to have diphtheria , tetanus and polio vaccinations to protect him from disease			0
mrs @entity39 , who worked at a solicitor ’s office before retiring , said : ‘ i could n’t believe how bad it was when i saw him – there were cuts and scabs all over his shoulder			2
‘ he was completely defenceless and someone should have been keeping an eye on him because he has problems communicating and he suffers in silence			0
‘ if i kept my son in the conditions they keep him in , i ’d have social services round and they ’d put me in prison			0
’ the mother - of - two , who lives in @entity85 , @entity86 , with mr @entity8 ’s stepfather @entity87 , 66 , said she had made a formal complaint and was now considering suing the hospital			1
one of the units on the @entity92 site , in @entity59 , @entity60 claims : hospital bosses have claimed the rat was in fact a field mouse , but mrs @entity39 was disgusted at hospital staff 's ' outrageous ' suggestion her son was attacked by a field mouse because of the size of the bite marks mrs @entity39 added that she and her husband are trying to find a new @entity5 - run site to move her son to			1
she also said that the @entity5 trust had not yet responded to her complaint and was stalling for time			0
at one stage , it even wrote to her to say it would have to consult mr @entity8 before accessing his medical records			1
mrs @entity39 said that when she called the care unit , a member of staff answered the phone and told her : ‘ something terrible has happened			0
‘ a rat bit @entity8 and he ’s got marks on his shoulders			1
’ it was only when she phoned again later that the trust insisted it was a field mouse			0
field mice are herbivores and live on a diet of seeds			0
it is rare to see one and they are , on average , only a few centimetres long			0
mrs @entity39 added : ‘ i ’m so worried about leaving him there now			0
‘ they ’re supposed to look after him but they clearly ca n’t be bothered			2
‘ i have n’t slept well since it happened and the worst thing is i do n’t know how it ’s affected @entity8 because he ca n’t tell me			1
the staff at the hospital said it was long and had a long tail			0
‘ now if that ’s not a rat , i do n’t know what is			1
‘ @entity8 would n’t have known what was happening as he was so drugged up			1
‘ truth be told , it ’s been a nightmare having him at this hospital			0
‘ they ca n’t work out what ’s wrong with him and the drugs they give him make him worse , not better			2
they wo n’t even let me pay to bring in a private doctor to assess him and get a second opinion			2
i ’m at my wits ’ end			0
’ @entity154 , the director of nursing at the trust , said the incident was ‘ genuinely shocking ’ and that she was taking the family ’s concerns ‘ extremely seriously ’			0
she added : ‘ our records indicate that a mouse was seen in the house in november and that pest control was alerted immediately but we are unable to provide a complete response to all the concerns raised until we know the outcome of our investigation			0
