mrs @entity1 , from @entity20 , said : ' venison and swede are the only foods that give me the mildest reaction			1
i have to experiment with what i can eat , and i just about seem to be able to cope with those			2
' other than that , i 'm limited to rhubarb and dried cherries			0
' ' i used to love my life , running the house , and looking after my teenagers , but now , i barely have the energy to do anything			0
' my husband and children are worried sick about me and i have to admit , i think my days are numbered			0
' her intolerance to food began back in the spring of 2011 when she started to develop abdominal pain			1
she said : ' i started getting awful pains in my stomach , side and abdomen so i went to the doctor			1
he organised to run a few tests but every time they came back normal			0

' the 45 - year - old said : ' i decided to try a gluten free diet to see if that would help			1
it made me feel a little better but still not completely well			0
' eventually even gluten free foods seemed to cause a bad reaction			0
i ate some brown rice at the beginning of the year and was in the worst pain i 've ever experienced			2
' as the weeks went by , my intolerance became worse and worse , i was starting to wonder if there was anything i actually could eat			0
' but whenever i spoke to the doctors they just told me it was impossible - i was literally laughed out of the surgery			2
' mrs @entity1 reached breaking point when she collapsed at home after suffering terrible pains and headaches			1
she said : ' i was rushed to hospital and stayed their for four weeks			0
i was given millions of tests but nothing seemed to work			0
i was even reacting to being fed through a tube			0
despite dozens of hospital tests and her trying a gluten - free diet , doctors can find no cause for mrs @entity1 's excruciating abdominal pains when she eats most foods ' i 've had an assessment to show that i 'm not making it all up , and mentally , the assessment showed that i 'm fine			1

people look at me and say i have a figure to die for , but i do n't want to be like this			1
' the only comfort the 45 - year - old has managed to find is thanks to fellow sufferers of @entity132			1
she said : ' the only people who seem to understand are people like me			2
it 's like a mixture of having the worst hangover in the world , and being poisoned			0
you ca n't understand it unless you 've been through it			2
' ' the more people that hear about @entity132 the better			1
i need to get the message out there			0
even some of my family and friends do n't believe me - i barely believe myself ! ' doctors need to hear that there are many people who are suffering terribly as a result of this			1
i will never accept that , in the 21st century , there are so many people suffering horrendously every day , yet being denied help by their doctors			2
