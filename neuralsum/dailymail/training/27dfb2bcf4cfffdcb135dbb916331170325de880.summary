loyal : @entity1 with @entity2 in 1990 a former @entity4 minister last night made incendiary claims that one of @entity2 ’s closest aides was implicated in one of the most harrowing child abuse scandals of recent times			1
@entity11 , a former @entity4 mp and ex-leader of the @entity13 , made the shocking allegation that he had seen evidence linking sir @entity1 to the @entity18 children ’s homes case , in which up to 650 children in 40 homes were sexually , physically and emotionally abused over 20 years			1
mr @entity11 also linked a second leading @entity4 grandee – now dead – to the scandals at homes including @entity24 and @entity25 , both near @entity26			1
he said official documents had identified the pair as frequent , unexplained visitors to the care homes			0
mr @entity11 – who helped establish the inquiry that unearthed the scale of the abuse – said bluntly : ‘ what i do know is that @entity1 was a paedophile			1
and the reason i know that is because of the @entity24			0
’ he added that @entity38 , who was @entity39 at the time of the inquiry , ‘ should have seen the evidence about @entity1 ’			1
@entity1 was @entity2 ’s parliamentary private secretary and deputy chairman of the @entity4			1
the claims prompted @entity45 mps to call for the files to be reopened to ensure that there had not been an ‘ establishment cover - up ’			0
mr @entity38 called the inquiry into the scandal in 1996 after care homes boss @entity51 was convicted of child abuse			1
it concluded that a paedophile ring around @entity55 and @entity26 had caused ‘ appalling suffering ’ to children in care in the @entity58 and @entity59			0
scandal : abuse was uncovered at the @entity24 home , near @entity26 , @entity18 mr @entity11 said he received detailed briefings about the case while junior welsh office minister for health and social services			1
he said : ‘ it fell to me to decide initially whether to hold a public inquiry			0
so i saw all the documentation and the files			0
his name stood out on the notes to me because he had been an mp			0
he and [ the other man ] were named as visitors to the homes			0
’ mr @entity11 could not offer anything to substantiate his claims against @entity1 , who died in 1995 at the age of 51			1
but he said that as the mp for @entity79 , he would have no obvious reason to visit care homes in other @entity44 ’ constituencies			2
the claims have emerged amid growing public revulsion over the institutional failures revealed by the @entity87 scandal			0
@entity87 was a regular guest of @entity2 ’s at @entity88			2
mr @entity11 added that he was frustrated that the £ 13 million , three - year inquiry headed by sir @entity90 had not uncovered any evidence to link @entity1 to the abuse			1
he said : ‘ it would seem that there are some parallels with @entity87 in that @entity1 got in under the radar , and his activities did not appear in the final report ’			2
however , he said that as @entity39 , mr @entity38 ‘ should have seen the evidence about @entity1 ’ in the preliminary files			1
network : further abuse was uncovered in @entity103 , which was also run by @entity51 last night , sources close to mr @entity38 said that he had never come across any information implicating @entity1			2
his spokesman said : ‘ mr @entity38 established the @entity107 precisely because of the serious and widespread reports of abuse			0
it was set up to be as thorough as possible and its terms of reference were widely supported in @entity111			0
’ @entity4 peer @entity112 – a @entity4 contemporary of @entity1 ’s in the @entity115 – told @entity116 : ‘ without hard evidence i can not find these allegations credible			1
’ mr @entity120 ’s intervention follows claims last week by former @entity4 minister @entity122 that @entity1 had sex with 16 - year - old boys when the age of consent was 21 and that he had been protected by a ‘ culture of sniggering ’			1
in her diaries , she called him ‘ a noted pederast ’ , with a liking for young boys			0
last week , @entity45 mp @entity131 stunned the @entity115 when he asked @entity132 to examine historic allegations about a high - level paedophile ring linked to a former @entity136 aide – who he later clarified was not @entity138			2
last night @entity45 mp @entity139 said of the allegations about @entity1 : ‘ these are extremely serious claims			2
the evidence files should be reopened to ensure that there has not been an establishment cover - up at the heart of @entity146 ’			0
@entity18 police did not respond to calls for comment .			0
