a @entity1 aircraft carrier travelled through the @entity2 and into the @entity3 yesterday , ignoring threats from @entity5 to shut down the strategic shipping lane			2
the @entity7 went through the strait without incident in what @entity1 government officials claimed was a routine changeover			1
however , it was accompanied by @entity15 and @entity16 ships , a highly unusual joint exercise in the militarily sensitive region			1
and a spokesman from the @entity15 's @entity20 said the flotilla was intended to ' underline the unwavering international commitment to maintaining rights of passage under international law '			1
provocative ? the @entity7 passed through the controversial @entity2 on sunday this appears to be a direct challenge to @entity5 , which has been increasingly belligerent over the strait in response to the threat of new economic sanctions targeting the @entity33 's nuclear programme			1
when the carrier @entity36 departed the @entity3 in late december , @entity5 officials warned the @entity1 not to return			2
a top @entity5 naval official boasted that closing the @entity2 , the world 's most important oil shipping gateway , would be ' easier than drinking a glass of water '			1
the threat led to a round of escalating rhetoric between the two sides that spooked oil markets and raised the possibility of a military showdown - the only way @entity5 would be able to control the strait			2
flotilla : the @entity7 was accompanied by @entity36 , right , and ships from @entity15 and @entity16 but on saturday a senior figure in the powerful @entity54 struck a more conciliatory tone , claiming that @entity5 did not mind the @entity56 resuming operation in the @entity3			1
' @entity1 warships and military forces have been in the @entity3 and the @entity62 region for many years and their decision in relation to the dispatch of a new warship is not a new issue and it should be interpreted as part of their permanent presence , ' he said			0
a spokesman for the @entity72 , which is based in @entity73 , said the @entity75 's passage through the strait was ' regular and routine ' and that it had been ' previously scheduled '			0
on his own : @entity5 's increasingly isolated president @entity78 went to @entity79 to search for allies in his anti-american fight tensions between @entity5 and the @entity1 have been escalating in recent weeks as @entity83 prepares to implement new sanctions over the country 's nuclear enrichment programme , which @entity87 says is for energy production but which the @entity56 believes is aimed at producing atomic weapons			0
notable developments have included the trial of an @entity5 - @entity1 man sentenced to death for spying for the @entity1 , and the assassination of another @entity5 nuclear scientist , which the @entity1 has condemned			0
@entity5 's president @entity78 went on a tour of @entity79 looking for allies in left - wing leaders such as @entity100 's @entity99			0
last week saw both sides tone down their rhetoric , as mr @entity83 was reported to have sent a letter to mr @entity78 offering more back - channel talks .			0

@entity7 was accompanied by ships from @entity15 and @entity16 in unusual move
@entity15 official says flotilla was meant to send a *message*
