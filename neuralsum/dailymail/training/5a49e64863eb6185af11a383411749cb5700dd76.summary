by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 19:03 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 19:03 est , 29 september 2013 outrage : @entity3 police chief constable @entity2 , pictured here in 2012 , has sparked debate after suggesting addicts should be ' given drugs ' a senior police officer sparked fury last night after he called for the legalisation of banned hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine			1
@entity14 , the chief constable of @entity15 , said the war on drugs had ‘ comprehensively failed ’ and compared it to @entity20 ’s disastrous efforts to ban alcohol during the prohibition era			1
addicts , he said , should be given or sold hard drugs through the @entity25 and ‘ treated and cared for ’ instead of criminalised			1
but anti-drugs campaigners condemned his comments			1
@entity28 , from @entity29 , said police were already failing to enforce drugs laws properly			1
‘ @entity32 has never been fought – in fact there has never been a war on drugs , ’ she added			1
‘ the police go around handing out cautions and a slap on the wrist even for people caught with hard drugs			1
‘ they hardly ever get prosecuted and sent to prison			0
people know that users take cocaine all the time in nightclubs , and the police should go in and catch these people			0
' the idea of giving out hard drugs for free at taxpayers ’ expense is abhorrent			2
’ mr @entity2 ’s intervention into the drugs debate came in an article for the @entity56 newspaper yesterday			2
he argued that a controlled supply would undermine the criminal gangs who make millions selling drugs			2
he wrote : ‘ not all crime gangs raise income through selling drugs , but most of them do in my experience			2
so offering an alternative route of supply to users cuts off the gangs ’ income stream			0
‘ if an addict were able to access drugs via the @entity25 or some similar organisation then they would not have to go out and buy illegal drugs			1
they should not , of course , be freely available			0
‘ i think addiction to anything – drugs , alcohol , gambling , etc – is not a good thing , but outright prohibition hands revenue streams to villains			2
’ treatment ? anti-drugs campaigners decried suggestions that @entity25 hand outs of drugs could cure addicts comparing @entity96 ’s drug policies with the situation that gave rise to gangsters such as @entity100 in 1920s @entity20 , he said : ‘ have we not learned the lessons of prohibition in history ? ' @entity105 ’s sinister rise to prominence in the @entity20 was pretty much funded through its supply of a prohibited drug : alcohol			1
that ’s arguably what we are doing in the @entity96			0
’ the police chief also said he was ‘ deeply disappointed ’ the @entity114 had abandoned plans for a minimum price for alcohol			2
mr @entity2 , the head of criminal intelligence at the @entity120 , has spent 34 years as a police officer			0
but his suggestions have been given short shrift by ministers			0
a @entity126 spokesman said : ‘ drugs are illegal because they are dangerous			0
they destroy lives and blight communities			0
‘ the @entity96 ’s approach on drugs remains clear			0
warning : the constable said prohibiting drugs will lead to the rise of gangs like @entity100 's during the @entity136 in @entity20 in the 1920s , who thrived bootlegging alcohol mr @entity2 's claims that we have lost the ' war on drugs ' has been blasted as hyperbolic in comparison with places like @entity146 and @entity147 where drug trafficking is far more severe ' we must help individuals who are dependent by treatment , while ensuring law enforcement protects society by stopping the supply and tackling the organised crime that is associated with the drugs trade			1
’ a recent report by the @entity157 appeared to endorse decriminalising drugs as a way of helping @entity161 countries combat organised crime			0
chief constable @entity163 , @entity120 ’s drugs spokesman , said : ‘ clearly , a senior colleague like @entity14 is entitled to his views and he has added his contribution to the national debate , but it would be @entity120 ’s position that these are matters for @entity171 to decide			1
‘ we need in particular to be very thoughtful about setting clear boundaries , especially for young people , in relation to drugs , their misuse and criminal activity surrounding them			0

@entity14 , chief constable of @entity15 , said @entity25 should hand out drugs to addicts and treat them
anti-drugs campaigner @entity28 , of @entity29 , said the war on drugs ' has never been fought '
it follows *justice* *secretary* @entity188 's *vow* to ban ' simple ' cautions for serious offences such as drug abuse and drug handling
