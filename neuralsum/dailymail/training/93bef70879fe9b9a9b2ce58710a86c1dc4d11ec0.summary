by @entity0 a slim - fitting @entity2 cotton t - shirt in tomato red , chic under a nautical blazer or relaxed over jeans			2
versatile , soft and beautifully made , you might guess it was from @entity8 , that @entity10 - to - the - core favourite of the preppy middle classes			1
in fact , it is made by @entity14 , a @entity15 brand that has been making basics since 1860 , and is now headed by hot young @entity15 designer @entity17 ( best known for catwalk creations loved by @entity19 and @entity20 )			1
at £ 55 to @entity8 ’s £ 29.50 ( for a vintage - finish cotton t - shirt ) , it ’s not quite designer prices , but it ’s hardly @entity26 either — but then this is n’t @entity28 tat produced by the billion , it ’s from the @entity30 company that brought you @entity32 ’s classic polo shirts			2
@entity15 beauties : as shops stocked ever cheaper fast fashion , shopping for deals became a national pastime			1
however , high - quality @entity15 brands are making a come back			1
pictured : @entity41 dress , £ 190			0
now @entity43 is having an extraordinary revival : worn by @entity45 on tour and explorers in the @entity48 , opening stores in hip parts of @entity41 and popping up in @entity51 , it is leading the charge to bring @entity15 craftsmanship back to our @entity26			1
a generation ago , the @entity15 @entity26 was just that : town centres filled with @entity15 - made fashion , providing skilled work and trustworthy quality			1
but in the @entity63 , the lure of cheap factories in @entity28 and beyond proved irresistible			2
home - grown staff were laid off , machinery was sold to the @entity66 and factories closed			2
@entity67 , founder of @entity68 , which collates information on products made in the @entity15 , saw it all happen			1
‘ i worked as a buyer for 20 years , and saw my career change from sourcing everything from the @entity15 to spending all my time in the @entity66 , ’ she says			1
‘ i remember when we first bought from @entity28 , we thought they ’d missed a zero off the price it was so cheap			0
’ as shops stocked ever cheaper fast fashion , shopping for deals became a national pastime			0
we boasted about what a steal we ’d bagged , and shopped at @entity84 because we were clever , not because we could n’t afford better			0
‘ people used to spend a month ’s earnings on their coat , and it would last years , ’ says @entity67			0
‘ now we ’ve got coats at @entity84 for £ 40			0
that would be unheard of a couple of decades ago			0
’ buy @entity15 : a generation ago , the @entity15 @entity26 was filled with @entity15 - made fashion			1
pictured : colenimo vintage lace jaket , £ 119 but the tide is slowly turning and for an increasing number of shoppers , long - lasting quality , guilt - free ethics and a lower benefits bill ( thanks to more @entity15 jobs ) feel like a better return on their investment than pretty rags that fall apart after four or five washes			1
and a number of brands are happy to offer them the option			0
from big retailers such as @entity113 and @entity114 , who are starting to dip their toes back in @entity15 waters , to smaller companies , such as @entity14 , that have doggedly pushed on for years			2
while such quality does n’t come cheap — simply because the labour costs here are higher than in the @entity66 — if you do want to invest in the best of @entity15 , here ’s where to look			1
thanks to @entity15 ’s tailoring heritage , suiting is generally a good buy — and not just at the high end			2
for basic but flattering shapes , quality fabrics and contemporary edge , look no further than @entity135 ( hot squash.com ) , based on innovative textiles that help regulate your body temperature			0
its sexy ruched , knee - length dress ( pictured , below left ) is £ 95			0
for sophisticated tailoring in a pared - back palette , @entity144 ( libbylondon.com ) hits the spot with its practical - but - pretty power - dressing : the @entity150 dress ( main picture ) , £ 190 , comes in two dusty pinks and creates va - va - voom curves , and the pure silk shirts for £ 90 look graceful			0
sleek , simple and stylish : @entity157 dress , £ 95 when it comes to evening wear , @entity158 ( paper london.com ) has vivid , beautifully made silk pieces such as an emerald cocktail dress on sale at £ 225 , or a @entity166 - alike sweater dress for £ 175.while several @entity26 brands offer @entity15 - made selections , from @entity169 to @entity170 , more surprising is @entity114 ’s upmarket @entity172 collection			1
highlights include silk jungle - print separates and a knee - length bamboo - print dress , £ 195 , and a pale teal satin skirt at £ 95.in a not - dissimilar vein , tiny brand @entity178 ( colenimo.com ) uses exquisite fabrics , often @entity15 , to make classic - with - an - edge pieces such as a silk crepe - de - chine black dress with white collar at £ 149 , or a vintage lace jacket ( above , left ) at £ 119			1
@entity186 @entity15 : @entity188 jacket , £ 530 it ’s not just special buys — everyday items are made here , too			1
welsh brand @entity192 ( hiutdenim.co.uk ) has boyfriend jeans for £ 125 , while for a smarter look , @entity194 ( wizardjeans.com ) has a bum - lifting midnight - blue bootcut for £ 95 or skinny jeans , £ 30			0
@entity199 ’s founder @entity198 , who brought her production back to the @entity15 from @entity28 , describes the process as ‘ a real uphill struggle			2
we take far less profit than normal , but we believe it ’s the right thing to do ’			0
and if you ’re taken by the @entity208 aesthetic of @entity209 , why not get the real deal — a hand - tailored hacking jacket ( above ) by @entity188 ( katherinehooker.com ) at £ 530 or a high - necked tweed style at @entity213 ( maquiendesign.co.uk ) , £ 120 .			0
