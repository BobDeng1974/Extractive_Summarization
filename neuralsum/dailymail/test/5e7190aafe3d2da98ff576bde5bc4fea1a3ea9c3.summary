sipping a glass of glorious red wine which has been carefully aged in a hand - crafted oak barrel is my idea of heaven			1
but until now the only way to enjoy a tipple with that gorgeous authentic taste that can only develop through spending years in a special wooden cask has been to pay through the nose			1
the second i see the word ‘ spicy ’ on a bottle label ( which suggests an oaky flavouring ) , i instantly know the price will be much higher			0
a £ 5 bottle has suddenly become £ 12 because the wine has lingered in an oak barrel before bottling			1
so when i read this week about a new gadget that claims to be able to ‘ oak age ’ wine in hours rather than years , my curiosity was seriously roused			1
the @entity25 promises to impart an authentic aged flavour — a process that can take up to two years — in just a day or two			1
growing up on his parents ’ vineyard in @entity42 , @entity38 became fascinated by the process of ageing wine			2
watching his dad painstakingly filling small barrels of wine for oaking , he wondered why the wine could n’t be stored in the same huge vats that had been used to ferment it			2
when mr @entity52 explained that the smaller the oak barrel , the faster the oak infusion , @entity38 got his @entity56 moment			2
how about a bottle made out of oak which will ‘ oak age ’ a single bottle in a fraction of the time ? now , after three years of experimenting , @entity38 has developed what he claims is the ‘ smallest possible oak infusion vessel ever made			1
’ the idea is you decant a bottle of wine into the oak bottle , leave for up to 48 hours ( depending on the strength of the oak flavour you fancy ) and — hey presto ! — your supermarket bottle of plonk fresh from last year ’s grape harvest should suddenly taste like a posh wine from a world - class vineyard that has had years to mature and develop oaky flavours			1
ageing a wine overnight is the holy grail of wine lovers			2
it ’s like finding the elixir of eternal youth — in reverse			0
but can a simple gizmo really mimic such a time - honoured process ? can i turn a cheap plonk into a lovingly aged wine ? i ’m eager to try			1
when it arrives , the @entity25 looks like a wooden version of the thermos flask i take on picnics			1
it ’s plain and reassuringly sturdy			0
for my test i choose a @entity95 merlot ( simply @entity96 , @entity97 £ 4.20 )			2
it ’s an unpretentious , fruity wine , great for glugging , but it ’s hardly stellar quality			2
however , as with the @entity104 wines such as @entity105 and @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and , of course , the @entity111 @entity110 , once you add oak to a merlot you are entering a whole new world — and price bracket			2
merlots benefit hugely from being oak aged			1
i ’m itching to start my test			0
but first i have to fill the @entity25 with water			1
@entity116 shrinks when dried out , so the instructions warn me the @entity25 is inclined to leak until it is sealed using lukewarm water to swell and close up any open wood grain			1
sure enough , water drips out over the next two hours — enough to saturate the kitchen towel i put underneath			2
eventually , the wood ready and the drips stop			0
i pour out the water , decant my @entity96 , pop the stopper on and wait			0
@entity38 suggests the whole process can take anything from 24 to 48 hours			2
that ’s a drop in the ocean compared to the 12 - to - 18 month ageing process in a proper barrel			0
the @entity132 were n’t wine drinkers but apparently were the first to use oak barrels to store and transport their beer and mead			1
the wine - loving @entity137 leapt at the invention — they were sick of their ceramic jugs crashing and breaking on long sea voyages			2
the @entity25 promises to impart an authentic aged flavour they quickly discovered the wooden barrels not only added flavours to the wine but , because wood is porous , also allowed air ( specifically , what we know as oxygen ) to permeate the contents slowly , removing harsh flavours			1
in fact , that ’s the other reason we pay such a premium for barrel - aged wines — the oxygen changes the molecules in the wine , sweetens the acids , softens the bitter bits and lets the tannins ( or sediment ) drop to the bottom , giving it a gorgeous rich mellowness			1
great @entity170 winemakers have been using the same technique ever since			0
it ’s still all done by hand			0
barrels , which hold up to 300 bottles of wine , can cost well over £ 1,000 , with the price determined by the quality of the oak that ’s been used and the skill of the cooper making them			1
while the overwhelming aroma you get from oak is vanilla , if the wood is toasted a bit over a fire , you also get nutty flavours of hazelnuts and almonds			1
toast even longer and you add chocolatey flavours and , later , coffee and burnt toast			2
the skill of the winemaker is deciding just how much flavour he wants in his barrel			0
all these flavours infuse the wine			1
can the @entity204 — which apparently has a ‘ medium toast ’ flavour — do the same in just one day ? and , just as important — can it turn a young fruity wine into a vintage quaff ? if it can , i ’ll be the first to splash out £ 50			1
the length of time you leave your wine in the @entity204 depends how oaky you like it — but it ’s advisable to sample the contents regularly			2
therefore , 14 hours into the experiment , i decide to see how the magic is working			2
pulling out the stopper , sadly , has none of the heady satisfaction of uncorking a bottle			0
but i ’m prepared to overlook the disappointment if the taste is right			0
as i take my first sniff , i immediately get a delicious aroma of vanilla			0
my spirits rise , but after the first sip they crash			0
it ’s wine — with a hint of furniture polish			0
even though the wine has been in the @entity204 for less than 24 hours , the taste of wood is overpowering			1
all the natural freshness of the fruity young @entity96 has disappeared			0
i feel like i ’m licking a plank of wood			0
@entity31 said the @entity25 is a fun product that would certainly make an interesting gift for a wine buff in a traditionally oak - aged wine , the woody flavours would integrate over many months to give a rich , mellow taste			1
but this has been forced			0
this might be remedied by leaving the wine in the bottle for less time			0
in fact , the @entity25 ’s developers say you can taste the wine every hour until you reach a level of oakiness appropriate for that particular bottle			1
i also think the @entity25 might actually improve the more times you use it			1
with each use , i imagine the strong oak flavour will fade			0
this is because alcohol , which is solvent , dissolves the flavours from inside the bottle			0
the @entity25 is the result of three years of experiments for example , in winemaking a producer might empty his oak barrel after 18 months			1
at this point some 80 per cent of the flavours created by the barrel will have disappeared			0
reuse the barrel , and there should be only 20 per cent of the oak - lined flavour left			0
by the third time you use the barrel , you might only have 5 per cent of the original flavour			0
i suspect it will be the same with the @entity25 , so those overpowering notes of beeswax furniture polish would mellow			1
the @entity25 is a fun product , and would certainly make an interesting gift for a wine buff			1
but there is another trick you can use to improve wine			0
simply open your bottle of wine , pour half a glass , screw the top back on ( or put in a stopper ) and give the bottle a good shake			0
this forces oxygen into the wine , loosening the flavours and making it more drinkable			1
leave for five minutes before you enjoy			0
perfect — and it wo n’t cost you a penny .			0

the @entity25 claims to ' oak age ' wine in hours rather than years
the product retails at £ 50 and promises to impart authentic aged flavours
@entity31 says its a fun product and would make an interesting gift
