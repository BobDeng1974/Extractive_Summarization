an anxious wait lies in store for @entity2			1
after his calamitous mistake gifted @entity5 a passage to the @entity8 fifth round , @entity3 could be forgiven for calling on @entity9 to step in when @entity10 arrive at @entity11 on wednesday			1
the @entity14 semi-final second leg at @entity15 is his most important game yet as manager			2
spurs have n't won any silverware for seven years and @entity3 knows a night in @entity20 is set to be tricky enough without the potential for any self - inflicted pain			1
he will have watched @entity2 allow a tepid stoppage - time @entity25 volley bobble over him and wonder whether it 's worth risking not starting with @entity9			1
@entity2 is concerned that he may not play again soon after his mistake against @entity5 @entity2 ( left ) conceded a goal from @entity25 as @entity10 lost 2 - 1 and went out of the @entity8 the @entity29 is rivalled only by @entity30 as the @entity32 's best between the sticks			1
with that in mind , @entity3 's decision seems clearcut			2
@entity2 was actually lucky to still be on the pitch at the time of his howler after referee @entity39 ludicrously felt @entity40 had dived when clearly fouled in the box			1
regardless , @entity2 wants an opportunity to make amends			1
' i do n't play that much so these kind of games are very important , ' he admitted			2
' i said sorry to the boys but they were ' do n't be silly , you did very well '			2
but you feel a responsibility			0
' to be honest they did not say to me that you will be playing in the @entity8 and @entity14 , i just hear it the day before a game			0
but i hope they still give me the chance to play on wednesday			0
' it is hard and @entity57 will play the game of their lives probably			0
if we don ' t understand the importance of the game for the club and fans then we do n't deserve it			0
i am 100 per cent sure we will			0
' the ramifications of the gaffe , however , are likely to linger for @entity2 — even if he is given the nod			1
@entity2 is second choice for @entity10 behind @entity9 - widely considered as one of the best in the league @entity10 manager @entity3 must decide whether to continue with @entity2 against @entity11 ' it will ( play on my mind ) but you have to go on , ' he added			1
' i am 31 and i have dealt with worse			0
that is part of the life			0
@entity81 makes mistakes , so why could n't i ? ' one man who did n't fluff his lines was @entity85 , who brilliantly equalised for the @entity86 and is now gearing himself up for a first trip to @entity88 on saturday			0
@entity90 hold no fears for @entity93 's side , the striker argues			2
doing the double against @entity96 's @entity95 is not beyond the realms of possibility — particularly after this sure - footed performance at @entity100			1
' we need to play with the same intensity			0
we must play strong because we know they take the ball always but we must defend well and use the counter attack , ' @entity85 said			0
' they are not as good as in the past seasons but we must press more there			0
' now against @entity90 we believe we have a chance because we always create chances and we created many chances against @entity10			1
@entity5 saw opportunities come and go before they finally dumped @entity3 's @entity10 out of the @entity8			1
@entity85 ( centre ) celebrates equalising for @entity5 in the game against @entity10 on saturday @entity93 ( left ) feels the result will add to the belief that @entity5 can stay in the @entity32 for a delighted @entity93 , it is that attacking ingenuity which will prove key if they are to back up the shock 5 - 3 win earlier in the season			1
' they are the games we 've been aspiring to play for a decade , ' he said			0
' there ' s no point in being anything other than positive and look forward to them			0
' it 's not exactly a straightforward one , but i think we 've shown here and places like @entity136 that we can be a threat			2

@entity2 is second choice in goal for @entity10 behind @entity9
he was given a rare start against @entity5 but made an error
the mistake meant he conceded @entity5 's winner and @entity10 lost 2 - 1
