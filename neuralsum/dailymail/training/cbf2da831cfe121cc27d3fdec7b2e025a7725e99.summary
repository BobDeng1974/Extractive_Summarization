desolate , shattered , warped and stained , this abandoned series of @entity2 - coloured pod homes paints a bleak picture			2
the flats , known as @entity6 , were built in @entity7 , @entity8 and designed to be part of a holiday resort			1
they were built in 1978 as a vacation destination for @entity14 military officers deployed to the @entity15 and wealthy @entity8			1
history surrounding the sad structures is even stranger			0
the buildings were abandoned in 1980 after investment losses by developers @entity21 and a number of bizarre deaths , including several suicides and car accidents during construction			1
according to locals a burial ground for @entity24 soldiers lies underneath the buildings and the site is haunted @entity7 in @entity8 where the site was built but later demolished to make way for a new water park these shots were taken in 2008 by photographer @entity44 , 33 , a couple of years before the pods were demolished by the @entity7 government			1
the site is said to be haunted but is in the process of being converted into a commercial seaside holiday resort and water park			2
a number of bizarre deaths , including several suicides and car accidents occured during construction a graffetti - ed and abandoned slide ( left ) and a small figure sits by a pod ( right ) in these 2008 photographs gem , a real estate administrator from the @entity62 , said : ' as an avid documenter of man - made landscape , i found these pod houses very cool			1
' the colours , the retro futuristic style , whoever designed and built these had a lot of balls			0
' as to their demise , people give me different stories			0
a real estate administrator from the @entity62 says the prices were too high and they failed to sell apparently , these retro futuristic building styles were popular at that time , but the price was so high that they failed to sell most of the units			0
i guess the developer went broke and that 's why they lay in absolute ruin for years			0
' maybe the era was all wrong , the target market was all wrong , and the grand experiment failed , but they were still intriguing to look at			0
