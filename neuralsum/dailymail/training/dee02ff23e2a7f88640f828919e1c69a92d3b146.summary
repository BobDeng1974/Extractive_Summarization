@entity1 chairman @entity0 shocked fellow directors by seeking a pay - rise – just as the club were lurching towards a new cash crisis			1
@entity6 has learned that @entity0 requested an increase to his salary shortly after agreeing to become executive chairman on a temporary basis on october 30			1
his request came despite the @entity1 board being forced to accept a £ 2million loan offer from @entity15 owner @entity14 to keep the club alive			1
@entity14 subsequently loaned a further £ 1m – secured against assets – to keep the lights on			0
@entity1 chairman @entity0 ( second from the left ) shocked fellow directors by seeking a pay - rise appointed temporary , then permanent , non-executive chairman in november 2013 , @entity0 was detailed to work for @entity1 two days a month , but assumed a full - time role following the departure of former chief executive @entity24 and finance director @entity25			1
asked to oversee the search for replacements , eventual appointments @entity26 and @entity28 were already working at the club as consultants and were always expected to fill the posts			1
on the morning his new role was confirmed , @entity0 spoke to @entity35 outside @entity36 , joking of ‘ more work , no more money ’			1
but in a communication with former colleague @entity25 uncovered under the @entity41 last september , the @entity36 chairman had referred to his ‘ poor level of remuneration ’			0
it ’s unclear if the @entity1 board agreed to the @entity0 request for a salary increase after it was tendered to the club ’s @entity47 but the proposal outraged former investors @entity50			1
@entity53 owner and financier @entity52 has increased his @entity1 takeover bid to £ 20million rangers remain in a perilous financial state as they desperately seek emergency funding			1
on thursday , @entity59 financier @entity52 upped his offer for the club after a previous £ 18m bid for control was rejected			0
@entity52 should discover on friday if his improved £ 20m bid has cut any ice with the embattled @entity36 board			0
the owner of @entity69 side the @entity53 also announced that he is ready to offer the crisis - hit club a £ 6.5m emergency loan to help keep it afloat			1
however , his ambition to hold a controlling interest in the club can only move forward if 75 per cent of shareholders back such a proposal			0
in a move that will chime with many in an increasingly disgruntled fan base , the @entity59 hinted he would be willing to continue working with two factions who last week snapped up significant stakes in the club			1
former @entity36 director @entity85 , who purchased 15 per cent of the club , and @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 – dubbed the @entity90 - who have a combined interest of around 20 per cent are acting independently with the shared aim of achieving regime change			0
@entity52 failed in his bid to buy a controlling stake of the @entity36 club after offering £ 18m rangers have yet to repay the £ 3m loan sports direct tycoon @entity14 gave the club last year while he has also tightened his grip on the club ’s retail division			0
however , @entity52 insists he will provide a steady stream of cash to the club if his bid is successful			1
in a statement given to the @entity110 , the 53 - year - old said : ‘ this new proposal hopefully helps the board deal with the short - term cash flow crunch and also addresses my desire to see the club back on a solid long - term financial footing			2
‘ it will also enable @entity1 to immediately repay the loans from @entity14 and @entity119 , and free it of debt			1
‘ if the board agrees to my proposal , i would provide a total of £ 16.4m - £ 20m to be invested in the club as the board determines - £ 6.5m immediately and the remainder following a share issue , taking the major step necessary to restore financial stability to the club			2
‘ i know , of course , that there are various groups of prominent fans who have been working hard for a long time to bring change to the club and they can rest assured that i am committed to building a strong partnership with fans and key stakeholders to do what is best for the club			1
@entity52 also offers a £ 6.5m emergency loan to the cash - strapped club to pay off debts in the short term ‘ i fully realise that a strong sports club needs local investment , local directors and local support to be successful			1
‘ after everything they have been through in recent years , i understand some ( fans ) are rightly cautious about a guy they ’ve never heard of wanting to get involved in their club			0
i ’d feel exactly the same way			0
‘ but hopefully i can combine my financial resources and knowledge of professional sport with strong local leaders and top - notch management to bring @entity1 back to elite level			2
‘ i look forward to receiving the response of the @entity1 board			2
’ curiously , @entity52 felt the need to respond to speculation on social media that he was working with other parties			0
his spokesman said : ‘ there appears to be some speculation in online fans ’ forums , prompting questions from the media asking if mr @entity52 is working in conjunction with other figures associated with @entity36			0
@entity85 bought a 14.5 per cent share in the club this month and is keen to protect the club for the fans ‘ let me assure you he is not			2
to be very clear , mr @entity52 has never met or spoken to @entity14 , @entity119 or @entity186			0
‘ and for the complete avoidance of doubt , he has never met or spoken to @entity189 or @entity190			0
he is not working with , acting for , or alongside any of these individuals			0
‘ mr @entity52 is acting on his own behalf , although he has repeatedly said that if he succeeds in acquiring a majority stake in @entity1 he would like to work with others who clearly have the best long - term interests of @entity1 at heart			2
’ @entity1 meantime confirmed they have repaid the £ 500,000 loan issued by @entity198 on monday after @entity199 paid the first installment on their £ 850,000 purchase of the midfielder @entity202 .			2

@entity0 *originally* *joined* @entity1 working two days a month
but as his *workload* increased he asked for a pay rise
the club was so cash poor at the time it was taking emergency loans
