the @entity0 has attacked @entity1 over its pioneering food ' traffic light ' system @entity1 efforts to combat the swelling obesity epidemic have been torpedoed by meddling @entity7			1
the @entity0 has attacked @entity1 over its pioneering food ' traffic light ' system , in a case that could end up in the @entity13 courts			1
the system is designed to help parents and consumers make healthy choices , by labelling food items red , green or orange according to their fat , salt and sugar contents			1
health professionals are losing the battle in the war against obesity			0
six in ten @entity1 adults and one in three children are now obese			0
the @entity29 opened infraction proceedings against @entity1 in february after @entity32 countries complained that the system would damage the sales of their high fat exports such as @entity36 , olive oils , salamis and cheeses			1
@entity40 said the scheme could be ' discriminatory ' because it ' discourages certain purchases , penalises industry and distorts the functioning of the internal market			0
' spokesman @entity46 said the @entity29 has sent a letter of formal notice to @entity1 that requires a reply within two months			2
@entity46 said : ' the commission will seek information from the @entity1 authorities on how this system will negatively affect the marketing of several products			0
' ' the concern that we have is that the system is likely to make the marketing of some products more difficult and therefore hinder or impede trade between @entity0 countries			0
' the ' simplistic ' character of the traffic light system might in certain instances create misconceptions among consumers , he said			1
the @entity29 opened infraction proceedings against @entity1 after @entity32 countries complained that the system would damage the sales of their high fat exports such as cheese @entity74 says it stood to lose 6 - 700million euros a year in sales in the traffic light system			1
national farmers association @entity77 claims the scheme fails to distinguish between junk food and traditional products with high fat that are part of a balanced healthy @entity32 diet			2
it said : ' the aim of the traffic - light system is to reduce the consumption of fat , salt and sugar , but it 's based only on the presence of certain substances , rather than on the actual quantities that are consumed , ' said in statement			2
' paradoxically , this ends up excluding things like extra-virgin olive oil from diets , while promoting sugar - free fizzy drinks , misleading consumers about the real nutritional value ( of the items ) '			0
