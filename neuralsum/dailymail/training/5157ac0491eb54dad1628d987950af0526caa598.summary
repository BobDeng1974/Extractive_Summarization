with its fuselage torn to shreds and emergency workers seemingly looking on in vain , there was surely only one fate for the passengers of this @entity8			1
just as well , then , that those on board were only crash - test dummies used for a groundbreaking experiment into the effects of jet disasters			1
the impact was pulled off deliberately for a documentary by the @entity16 and @entity17 exploring the results of a ' serious , but survivable ' crash - landing			1
the result is a terrifying collision which rips off the front of the jet in a cloud of sand , debris and twisted metal			0
the collision was filmed for a documentary and subjected to scientific tests in an effort to further understand ' serious , but survivable ' crashes and improve safety wrecked : the experiment was designed to study the crash - worthiness of the aircraft 's airframe and cabin as well as the impact of such disasters on the human body they flew the @entity8 over a remote part of the @entity32 desert before allowing it to smash into the ground			1
on this occasion the jet , which can carry up to 170 passengers , contained only crash - test dummies and dozens of interior cameras to film the sequence			1
a pilot had earlier flown the jet out to a @entity32 desert and ejected a matter of minutes before the aircraft was remotely crashed into the ground			2
the experiment was designed for scientists to study the crash - worthiness of the aircraft 's airframe and cabin as well as the impact of crashes on the human body			1
it is the first time in almost 30 years a passenger plane has been crashed on purpose for a scientific experiment			1
the last time was in 1984 when @entity75 teamed up with the @entity76 to crash a @entity8 720 into the @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79			1
going down : the @entity8 , which can normally carry 170 passengers , plunges into the ground in a remote - controlled descent moments after the pilot ejects amateur footage of the crash shows the plane heading into the desert floor while a helicopter flies alongside with a film crew			1
the latest experiment is expected to give a better insight into a crash landing thanks to the benefit of improved filming and remote control technology			0
the show is the result of four years ' work by @entity100 - based tv company @entity99			2
@entity101 , executive producer of the documentary , said : ' we felt the time was right to do it again			0
' it has never been safer to fly , but we want to use this as an opportunity to provide scientific data that might help to improve passenger safety in those extremely rare cases when a catastrophic aircraft accident does occur			0
' this has been an extraordinary feat of organisation , involving up to 300 people on location , including the production team , pilots , experts , risk management , plus local crew , military , fire teams and police			0
' the plane was crashed in a remote and unpopulated part of the @entity127 of @entity78 , @entity32			0
the location was chosen after an extensive international search to find a suitable location offering the perfect conditions for this ground - breaking scientific project			2
first for 30 years : the aircraft , which was loaded with crash - test dummies and cameras , sends sand and debris shooting into the air as it careers into the desert floor for safety reasons , an exclusion zone at the crash site was manned by security teams , as well as the @entity32 military and police			1
ahead of the crash , a full safety review of the project was undertaken by the highly - qualified pilots and commanders as well as the @entity32 authorities which concluded that it was safe for all concerned			0
following the crash , the aircraft will be salvaged and an extensive environmental clean - up operation is being carried out by a reputable agency with the full co-operation of the @entity32 authorities			2
@entity158 , @entity17 senior commissioning editor , added : ' this is a ground - breaking project , allowing a team of leading international scientists and crash investigators the first chance for a generation to study the crash of an entire passenger jet			2
' the scientists are also looking at passenger safety , plus new ' black box ' flight data recording technology			0
' they have been hugely enthusiastic supporters of the project and could n't wait to get to the crash site			0
despite long careers , none of them have seen a plane crash before their eyes like this before			0
' we hope that this documentary will provide valuable new scientific results as well as giving passengers vital information about how they can improve their own chances of surviving the extremely unlikely , but frightening , prospect of being in a serious plane crash			2
' @entity17 says it will not be releasing official footage of the crash until shortly before the documentary is due to be aired later this year .			0

@entity8 crashed deliberately for documentary exploring the effects of serious impacts on planes and people
@entity196 , which can carry 170 passengers , ripped in two as it smashes into ground moments after pilot ejects
loaded with crash - test dummies and cameras in first deliberate aircraft crash since @entity75 's 30 years *ago*
