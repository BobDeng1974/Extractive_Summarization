if ever an incident provided compelling evidence that footballers need to change their ways then it was the incident at the @entity5 on saturday			1
@entity6 is in the spotlight for making a lunge with his hand towards @entity11 ’s genitals			1
in @entity6 ’s own words , he ' touched @entity11 up '			1
@entity6 was rightly sent off			0
how did he think lunging at @entity11 ’s groin would help his team - mate , or his team ? @entity11 ’s revelation after the game that this sort of incident happens dozens of times every week in training is surprising , to say the least			1
@entity6 was sent off for @entity22 after he , in his own words , ' touched up ' @entity25 midfielder @entity11 referee @entity26 had no choice but to send @entity6 off after his behaviour crossed a line @entity11 revealed this sort of incident often goes on in training as players pass it off as banter this grabbing or touching each other ’s genitals , what is that all about ? do footballers do it because it ’s something else that passes as banter ? do other players laugh when one of their team - mates grabs someone else ’s private parts in training ? is that a source of amusement that passes most people by ? do footballers really grab each other ’s pants for the bants ? or is there something else going on ? are the players who take part in this behaviour actually showing signs of some repressed sexuality they do n’t feel comfortable fully expressing in a football environment			1
if you check back through all the instances of footballers and other sportsmen taking part in group sex , two things become clear			1
firstly there are a lot of cases			0
secondly , they almost always involve a lot of men and one female and often they are filmed by one of the guys			0
@entity6 walks off the pitch at the @entity5 after his red card for grabbing @entity11 's genitals what may have been acceptable on the training ground was certainly not in front of 24,000 watching fans the idea of watching one of my male colleagues or friends strip , get aroused , and then carry out some sort of sexual act with a female fills me with horror to be honest			1
yet in the sometimes bizarre , worryingly immoral world of sport , this is accepted as normal behaviour			0
i urge you to read @entity103 ’s amazing book @entity104 : @entity105 , @entity106 and a @entity107			0
it ’s one of the most important books written in recent years on this subject and highlights how lawless some sportsmen ( she focuses on @entity114 sport ) seem to be			0
as an extreme example closer to home , remember the @entity120 coach who defecated from a great height into a pint glass as a way of keeping his bored players entertained ? ' he did it for the lads , ' one of those players explained to me			0
i do n’t think i could find that entertaining in any way			0
do players laugh when one of their team - mates grabs someone else ’s private parts as @entity6 did ? @entity6 ( second left ) gave an apology that was the correct thing to do , but trying to mitigate it was disgraceful having said all of that , i am very much the kind of person who accepts that what might not be right for me , might work for others , and if that is the kind of stuff that floats your boat then go for it			1
as long as it ’s a private thing , and nobody gets hurt or violated , who can have a problem ? where it becomes an issue is when the line is crossed			0
and that ’s what happened with @entity6 on saturday			2
he did n’t understand that even though footballers might enjoy that kind of thing in training , doing it in front of over 24,000 paying spectators , including many children , is absolutely not acceptable behaviour			2
his apology was the correct thing to do , but trying to mitigate it by saying it was in defence of his young team - mate was disgraceful			1
if a player carried out this genital grab on a female referee , it would absolutely be treated as a sexual assault , and rightly so			0
@entity6 is lucky he did it to another man who accepts that genital touching is apparently all part and parcel of being a professional footballer			2
if a player carried out a genital grab on a female referee then it would rightly be treated as sexual assault @entity6 is lucky he did it to another man who accepts that genital touching was ok for footballers			2

@entity6 was sent off in @entity22 's 2 - 1 defeat against @entity25 on saturday
there are plenty of instances of footballers taking part in group sex
@entity11 said that @entity6 's behaviour was not *unusual* in training
@entity6 crossed a line - grabbing @entity11 in public was *unacceptable*
trying to mitigate his actions by saying it was in defence was disgraceful
