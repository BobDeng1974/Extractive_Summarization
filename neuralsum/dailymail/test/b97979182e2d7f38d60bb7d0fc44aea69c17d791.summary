an estimated 957,000 shoppers in the @entity1 alone ordered @entity2 on friday and this popularity surpassed expectations - even @entity2 's			1
in a leaked memo from the firm 's @entity7 , the retail chief said that customers wo n't be able to buy an @entity10 in store ' through the month of may ' due to ' high global interest combined with our initial supply			1
' it was expected to launch on 24 april			2
ms @entity7 added it had not been an easy decision and would provide more updates as the firm gets ' closer to in - store availability			1
' it was expected to launch on 24 april the memo was seen by @entity31 at @entity32			1
pre-orders of the watch began on friday at @entity35 ( 8.01am bst ) and within an hour many models in various regions had sold out including the most expensive 38mm gold edition version in the @entity1 and @entity39			0
models were showing a shipping time of four to six weeks or , in some cases , june despite the watch going on general sale on 24 april			0
an estimated 957,000 @entity1 shoppers ordered @entity2 on friday			1
that estimate comes from @entity46 , which measures digital commerce by tracking consumer e-receipts			0
its data from online shoppers showed an average of 1.3 watches bought per customer , with $ 503.83 ( £ 337 ) spent per item - although @entity2 has not officially confirmed any sales figures			1
in a recent @entity60 survey , more than 10 per cent of @entity58 owners say they will buy an @entity10 , a new survey has found			0
@entity62 surveyed 1,000 people , and found 11 % of people who own an @entity58 are ' very likely ' to buy the $ 349 smart timepiece this year			0
it said the demand for the watch was ' encouraging ' , and says sales are likely to hit hit traditional watch firms			0
it was initially believed that those who were willing to queue on 24 april would be able to buy the watch before people who had pre-ordered			0
but ms @entity7 memo has confirmed otherwise			1
' it 's important to remember that @entity10 is not just a new product but an entirely new category for us , ' the memo continued			1
' there 's never been anything quite like it			1
that 's why , for the first time , we are previewing a new product in our stores before it has started shipping			2
' given the high interest and initial supply at launch , we will be able to get customers the model they want earlier and faster by taking orders online			1
' she added that this is n't the way @entity2 intends to launch all new products form now on and it loves ' those blockbuster @entity2 product launch days ' , but told store employees to be prepared for the changes			1
on friday many buyers reported @entity2 's site was still down after the launch time , forcing them to order the device through the @entity107 on their phones or tablets			1
as part of the first wave of pre-orders , the watch can be bought online by people in the @entity1 , @entity39 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			2
@entity110 also went on display in @entity2 stores across these regions , as well as in @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity129 in @entity130 , and select @entity2 resellers in @entity121 and @entity120			1
online pre-orders began on friday at 12.01am @entity35 ( 8am bst ) and although @entity2 said the devices will ship on 24 april within just an hour this had been pushed back to june			1
buyers also reported the site was still down after the launch time , forcing them to order the device through the @entity107 app ms @entity7 added it had not been an easy decision and would provide more updates as the firm gets ' closer to in - store availability			1
' it was initially thought those who were willing to queue on 24 april would get the watch in stores before people who had pre-ordered			0
but ms @entity7 ' memo has confirmed otherwise ' will the @entity10 change your life ? well , possibly more than many realise until they start using it			1
' after a day or two with the watch , a strange thing happened - i completely stopped checking my phone			2
' while @entity2 may be the firm that really creates phone addiction , meaning we are constantly checking our handsets , with the @entity10 it may have cured it			1
' @entity2 undoubtedly has another hit on its hands with the watch			1
' as more and more apps appear , and developers actually get to spend time with it , i fully expect it be used in ways we ca n't even imagine now			0
' much like the @entity58 , apps could propel this to become a new computing platform - and even with the features it already has , the @entity2 watch is the most elegant way to communicate digitally			1
' @entity176 in @entity177 as with all @entity2 launches , the @entity179 tech giant took its store offline hours before the pre-order time to update its product pages			1
however , shortly after the pre-orders opened customers took to @entity186 to complain the site was still down and they could n't access the checkout			0
one said : ' irritated that i stayed up until 3am to pre-order an @entity190 and the site was down until after the may inventory already sold out			0
' and even after orders had been placed , some customers had trouble receiving confirmation details and delivery dates			2
one @entity186 user wrote : ' # @entity199 ordered but no email confirmation and the ' orders ' section on their site and app is down so i ca n't confirm it went through			2
' another wrote : ' no way in hell am i preordering an @entity190 today when it wo n't ship until june			0
' and another added : ' there 's an @entity190 for everyone			1
' unless you want it before june			0
' but for people who want to try on the watch they can book an appointment online			2
a @entity217 investigation earlier this week revealed that the @entity115 is the most expensive place in the world to buy the majority of @entity222 models			0
@entity2 's site and app still say the watch is available from 24 april , but when a model is selected and added to the customer 's online basket ( pictured ) , this changes			1
a sport model currently has a dispatch time of four to six weeks , while the edition model has a june delivery date and for people who want to try on the watch they can book an appointment online ( pictured )			2
the memo added this is n't the way @entity2 intends to launch all new products form now on and it loves ' those blockbuster @entity2 product launch days ' but told store employees to prepare for the change the most expensive edition model costs up to £ 2,500 more in the @entity115 compared to elsewhere in the world , while at the lower end of the scale @entity115 buyers pay up to £ 63 more for the @entity249 model			1
the cheapest model is the 38mm sport version and costs £ 299 in the @entity115			0
in the @entity1 , the same model costs $ 349 , but this does n't include sales tax			0
sales tax in the @entity1 depends on the region where the product is sold , but as an example @entity179 has one of the highest rates - at 9 % - while @entity262 has zero			2
all prices shown in the table above are for the most expensive option in each model and region			0
prices also include all relevant sales taxes			0
beneath each foreign price is the conversion rate in @entity272			0
in the @entity1 , @entity179 was chosen because it has one of the highest sales taxes at 9 % , while @entity262 was chosen for the opposite end of the scale because it does n't have a sales tax			0
@entity278 in @entity39 has one of the highest sales taxes at 15 % , while @entity280 has one of the lowest at 5 %			0
prices and conversions were correct at the time of writing			0
with both of these sales taxes added to the price of the sports model in the @entity1 , the total cost works out at $ 380.41 ( £ 257 ) and $ 349 ( £ 236 ) in the respective states			2
this is a difference of £ 42 when bought in @entity179 , compared to the @entity115 , and £ 63 when compared to @entity262			0
the effect is magnified for the top - of - the - range edition version , which costs from £ 8,000 for the 38mm model in @entity115 , compared to a starting price of $ 10,000 in the @entity1			2
at the time of writing , $ 10,000 converts to £ 6,769 - which equates to a difference of £ 1,231 before charges are taken into account			2
the most expensive version of the 38mm edition in the @entity115 is £ 13,500 in the @entity115 , and $ 17,000 in the @entity1			0
when sales taxes are added to the @entity1 model , the price rises to $ 18,530 in @entity179 , which converts to £ 12,543 - a difference of £ 957 .			1

the leaked memo was written by @entity2 's retail chief @entity7
she said she expects online orders ' to continue through the month of may '
and added it had not been an easy decision and would provide more updates as the firm gets ' closer to in - store availability '
