@entity0 's week started with two old stars being made ambassadors for the loyal service they had given the club			1
appropriately , then , it ended with a current player showing why he will deserve similar recognition in years to come			2
if @entity0 chairman @entity8 has a special place in his affections for @entity11 and @entity12 — those who were given ambassadorial roles — the same must be true of @entity15 , who recorded his 400th appearance on saturday			1
unused : @entity41 ( gk ) , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 goals : @entity40 ( 18 ) , @entity15 ( 74 ) @entity19 ( 5 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity46 6 : @entity47 7 , @entity48 5 , @entity49 6 , @entity50 6 , @entity51 6 : @entity52 7 ( @entity53 81mins ) , @entity54 , @entity55 5 ( @entity56 51mins 5 ) , @entity57 5 ( @entity58 51mins 7 ) : @entity59 7 unused : @entity60 ( gk ) , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 goals : @entity65 ( 55 ) referee : @entity67 8 attendance : 39,182 @entity69 : @entity15 @entity15 , 33 , is not someone who courts the limelight but he took centre stage when his late goal settled a tempestuous clash with @entity19 and allowed the momentum to continue to build in @entity0 ’s campaign			1
manager @entity77 described it as @entity0 ’s ‘ most satisfying win ’ so far			1
@entity80 , however , was anything but and it had nothing to do with being held up from speaking to the press by the loquacious @entity85			0
@entity80 was simmering over what he regarded as an offside goal from @entity40 and poor defending in the build - up to @entity15 ’s winner meant @entity19 had nothing to show for their efforts			1
@entity65 ’s 55th - minute strike was no consolation			1
‘ it is hugely disappointing , ’ @entity80 grumbled			0
‘ we tried to get the second goal and one punt up the middle is a hugely disappointing way to concede			2
@entity0 had four shots on target but they did n’t create a lot else			1
we have lost because of that and referee ’s decision			0
’ with @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 all injured , @entity19 were stripped of four key men who have contributed to the side ’s impressive start			0
starting for the first time this season , though , was @entity59 — a significantly leaner @entity59 — and he made an immediate impact , playing a magnificent sweeping ball to set @entity52 free to create the game ’s first chance			2
that scare jolted @entity0 into life and they began to impose themselves , with @entity121 and @entity122 to everything they did			2
@entity19 played with a back five but they were never entirely comfortable			0
@entity15 was involved in @entity0 ’s opener as was @entity38 , who would later succumb to hamstring damage , and after they combined , @entity36 ’s shot cannoned off @entity50 into the path of @entity40 , who swept his shot beyond @entity46			1
was he offside ? ‘ i have been to see the referee , ’ said @entity80			0
‘ i will keep what i said to myself			0
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity29 ( centre ) helpless as @entity19 's @entity65 ( right ) scores the equaliser @entity19 forward @entity65 lets fly just minutes after coming on as a second - half substitute @entity65 's shot took a wicked deflection that completely wrong - footed @entity0 goalkeeper @entity29 @entity19 manager @entity80 makes a change and brings on @entity58 for @entity57 in the second half @entity19 were sharper out of the blocks in the second half and restored parity when @entity65 exchanged passes with @entity52 to unleash a shot that struck @entity31 ’s heel and looped over @entity29			1
the game continued to be spiky and @entity48 was booked by @entity67 for a preposterous reaction to a shove from @entity35 , who was also booked			0
it was one of many excellent decisions , the best of which came in the 74th minute			0
a stricter referee would have halted play when @entity49 upended @entity40 but @entity67 allowed the move to continue and substitute @entity26 sped away to provide a cross for @entity15 , who gleefully finished			1
‘ @entity15 was outstanding , ’ said @entity77			2
‘ his role was marshalling the back four , so he was the last player you expected to see at the end of the counter-attack was him			0
but that sums him up			0
he gets the winning goal in a fitting performance			2
‘ he ’s an incredible ambassador for this club			0

@entity26 crossed for @entity15 to turn the ball home at the far post for winner
