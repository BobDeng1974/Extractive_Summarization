court : @entity1 was convicted of dangerous driving after being caught speeding at 144mph in his @entity3 a man was caught by police driving at 144mph after deciding to test his @entity3 to see how fast it would go			1
@entity1 , a self employed electrician , was recorded by police travelling at more than double the speed limit in his @entity3			1
magistrates heard how the 37 - year - old father had taken the vehicle out for a sunday afternoon spin which turned into a high - speed police chase			2
he decided to put his foot down on the @entity15 , which links @entity16 to @entity17 , and was spotted by a police officer on a slip road			2
@entity1 was yesterday banned from the road for 15 months after being convicted of dangerous driving and speeding			1
he was criticised by magistrates and prosecutors while @entity25 ( @entity26 ) claimed lives could have been lost			0
prosecutor @entity28 told @entity29 and @entity17 court in @entity31 how @entity1 had been spotted by a @entity33 police officer who had been on mobile patrol on a sliproad			1
the officer first noticed @entity1 ’s blue @entity3 travelling on the @entity37 ' at speed			1
' a short time later , the policeman heard the same vehicle approaching rapidly again and recorded @entity1 ’s car ' flash by ' at 144mph			1
the officer set off in pursuit of the speeding vehicle and only managed to catch @entity1 after he was slowed by other traffic			1
mr @entity28 told the court : ' the dangerous driving is in essence the speeding			1
' that speed and standard of driving fell far below that what would be expected of a competent and careful driver in the circumstances			0
' the danger which arises here from that grossly excessive speed , i think is a fair description of it , ( is that ) there are other users on that main road at that time of day			0
' excessively speedy ' : @entity1 took his @entity3 out for a sunday ' spin ' but decided to see how fast it could go			1
he was chased by a police officer who was only able to catch him after his version of the @entity3 pictured was slowed by traffic ' the road may not have been as busy as some other times but there was other traffic on the road and the danger of driving at that grossly excessive speed should be plain to see			1
' @entity1 lives in the village of @entity79 in @entity17 and has a three - and - a - half - year - old daughter			2
he had already pleaded guilty to speeding but yesterday also admitted dangerous driving , having initially denied the charge and been due to stand trial			2
solicitor @entity84 told the court his client had decided to take his car out for a ' spin ' and had decided to see how fast it could travel			0
he claimed @entity1 had got up to 144mph - as fast as the car could go , then decelerated to within the speed limit immediately			2
mr @entity84 insisted the defendant had only travelled at the top speed for a ' couple ' of seconds and that he had only broken the limit for less than half a minute			0
' there is no question of racing or putting someone else in danger , ' he said			0
' it was just a single burst over a short period of time although it was excessive speed			0
' magistrates imposed a 15 month driving disqualification , following which the defendant must sit an extended driving test			1
he was fined £ 816 , ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £ 81 and costs of £ 200			0
chairman of the bench @entity114 had told @entity1 : ' the risk of injury was immense on this occasion			0
' after the case , @entity118 , head of road safety at @entity26 , added : ' speeding is dangerous and puts the lives of the driver , their passengers and other people at risk of serious injury or worse			0
' around 400 people a year are killed in crashes in which someone exceeds the speed limit or drives too fast for the conditions			0
' driving at higher speeds also mean that drivers have less time to identify and react to what is happening around them , prolonging the time it takes for the vehicle to stop , and raising the risk of a crash occurring			0
