' the developer plans to build 80 homes as well as a park - and - ride on the land close to the @entity51 , and have been given permission as long as they move the seven - foot high stone monument to a nearby field			1
mr @entity40 , condemned the decision to shift the ancient obelisk as ' cultural violence ' and one of the ' worst attacks on heritage in the world '			0
he said : ' how dare anybody presume to shift it without good reason ? building a mundane houses in its vicinity is not good reason			0
ancient relic : the @entity11 is 1,500 years old ' it ’s an infringement of the cultural integrity of @entity30 ; it is cultural violence			1
' @entity33 confirmed permission for the homes had been granted subject to agreement on a number of issues , including the relocation of the @entity11			1

according to one of several versions of the legend , he eventually died ( different versions have different culprits ) and is said to have been buried in a field near @entity36 , @entity30 , close to the stone monument			0
the love story later inspired poems by @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 and the opera @entity112 by @entity113			0
touching history : the story of @entity116 is one of the greatest romances in history forbidden lovers : @entity120 and @entity121 in the 2006 film @entity11 and @entity14 new site for the stone : this is where @entity33 want the developer to relocate the stone to the story of @entity11 , a @entity30 knight and @entity14 , or @entity130 , an @entity15 princess , is an ancient @entity133 legend that became popular in the12th century through @entity135 medieval poetry			1

after evading several attempts by courtiers to entrap them , the lovers are eventually shown up to the @entity99 who sentences them to death			0
in one version , @entity92 poisons @entity11 while he is playing the harp to @entity14 and she is so upset that her lover is dying , she begs him to crush her to death so they can die together , which he does			1
in another version , @entity11 escapes on his way to the gallows and rescues @entity14 , but the pair are later caught			1
@entity92 agrees to pardon @entity11 if he hands @entity14 back to him and goes abroad , and @entity11 goes to @entity135 where he marries another girl simply because she is called @entity14			1
years later he is poisoned by a dart and can only be saved by the first @entity14			2

@entity92 was a king of @entity30 ( @entity30 ) in the 6th century , the son of @entity176 of @entity30 who died after a raid on his castle at @entity179 by the @entity99			0
