late last month , it was announced the foundation searching for a site to establish @entity4 's presidential library had ' major concerns ' about going with the @entity6			1
then just this week , @entity8 mayor @entity7 proposed an ordinance that would allow the university to build the library on the city park land if the school was selected			1
the timing of the proposal , which comes right before a selection deadline for the @entity17 , has opponents of the plan upset that the @entity8 machine is once again interfering in city affairs			2
timing : @entity8 mayor @entity7 proposed an ordinance this week that would allow the university to build @entity4 's presidential library on park land , with timing that has some opponents suspicious ' the big guys — the mayor , the university and the president — they 're all together , ' said resident @entity32 at a public hearing concerning the possible transfer			1
the city has not been keen to give up the spaces like the ones proposed for the library , 20 acres each in @entity39 and @entity40 on @entity8 's @entity41 , in the past			0
@entity43 , creator of @entity44 , proposed a $ 300million museum on the lakefront , but ran into the non-profit @entity47 , which is currently suing in federal court over the plans			0
@entity50 , president of @entity47 , is less optimistic of her chances against @entity7 , who was the president 's chief of staff until leaving in 2010 to run for mayor			0
with talk that @entity7 and the foundation may have used a crisis to limit public opposition to the plans , @entity54 said it was likely both were in talks about the space ' for a long time			1
' @entity7 has made the city 's bid for the presidential library a central focus as he heads into the february 24 election trying to avoid a close race with upstart candidate @entity70			2
designs : the @entity6 submitted a proposal for the library that included two parcels the school does not own that are part of city parks in the @entity41 machine politics : the ties between @entity7 and president @entity4 have opponents of the plan worried that the city will steamroll any opposition to putting in the library on parks land support in @entity8 's @entity41 , where the parks are located , has been weak for @entity7 amidst worries over education and crime , but could rebound with a presidential library in the neighborhood			1
' it is essential that the president 's library is here in the city of @entity8 and not in @entity98 , and i will do what is necessary ... to move heaven and earth to make this happen , ' @entity7 said this week			2
