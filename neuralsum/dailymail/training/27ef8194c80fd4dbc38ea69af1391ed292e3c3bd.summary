by @entity0 published : 18:49 est , 20 may 2012 updated : 18:50 est , 20 may 2012 the think tank set up by @entity2 has dealt a stinging rebuke to the government ’s efforts to tackle family breakdown and strengthen marriage			1
the @entity8 said ministers are not delivering on their promises because of a @entity11 ‘ tug - of - war ’ between the conservatives and the @entity14			1
its annual report card on the government ’s progress in dealing with the drivers of social breakdown highlights a string of policy failures and omissions in its approach to families			2
mr @entity2 with his wife @entity26			2
a think tank set up by the @entity28 has criticised efforts to strengthen families it cites the lack of progress being made in introducing transferable tax allowances and eliminating the ‘ couple penalty ’ in the welfare system			1
the @entity8 also castigates the government for its policies towards charities , in particular its decision to impose a cap on tax relief for charitable giving			2
ministers get four out of ten for their measures to reverse family breakdown but score even worse – two out of ten – for their approach to the voluntary and community sector			1
in a foreword , the think tank ’s managing director @entity48 said : ‘ there has been commendable political progress in areas such as addiction treatment strategy , education reforms and radical welfare reform			2
‘ yet there is much left for the @entity11 to do if it is to leave a social legacy in 2015			1
‘ the government ’s focus on supporting families and charities remains inadequate			2
‘ a political tug - of - war has once again stifled attempts to tackle the family breakdown that is devastating the poorest parts of our society			1
‘ and the government must rethink its dangerous plan to cap tax on charitable donations			0
‘ it is wrong to brand philanthropists as tax dodgers , as the mishandled arguments of ministers have done recently			1
‘ it is a proposal which makes less sense as time passes and it should be dropped with haste			0
' the @entity8 says high - profile events such as the @entity84 have not done enough to promote marriage the @entity8 report said ministers had so far failed to implement promises to boost marriage			1
‘ as leader of the opposition , @entity91 was firm in his resolve to bolster marriage and he is closely associated with the flagship policy of a transferable tax allowance , ’ it said			0
‘ however , the government has still not capitalised on opportunities to implement this measure			0
this can not simply be down to cost			0
’ and it criticised the fact that mr @entity2 had not laid out plans to tackle the ‘ couple penalty ’ in the benefits system			1
‘ a benefits system that disincentivises parents from living together makes it more likely that children will be raised by single parents , ’ it said			1
the think tank has called for @entity91 to back up his promises to bolster marriage the @entity8 was set up by mr @entity2 , now @entity28 , when the @entity116 were in opposition			0
the report card accuses ministers of repeating the mistakes of the previous @entity122 government by making childcare and parental leave their chief preoccupations			1
it suggests that differences between the @entity129 and @entity14 parts of the @entity11 are responsible for a ‘ frustrating lack of coherence in tackling the tragic breakdown of family life ’			0
and it warns that last summer ’s riots underline the urgency of dealing with the social challenges facing the country			0
the report card says the cap on charitable giving tax relief has damaged morale and demonstrated that some ministers do not appreciate the powerful and unique contribution that non-state agencies can make to tackling the most deep - rooted causes of poverty			2
however on other aspects of the broken society the @entity8 awards the government higher marks			0
it gets eight out of ten for its welfare reform efforts , seven out of ten for @entity157 ’s academies and free schools , seven out of ten for its emphasis on full recovery from drug addiction , and six out of ten for measures to help people avoid serious levels of debt			0
mr @entity48 said : ‘ the coalition still has time to lead the radical social reforms necessary to complement economic recovery			0
‘ it needs to reclaim the governing initiative which characterised its early months in office , and lead the country into a new era in which even the most dysfunctional communities have their chance to play a positive part in society			0
