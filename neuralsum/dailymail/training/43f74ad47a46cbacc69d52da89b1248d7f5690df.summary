@entity2 's most reviled female criminals are living in the same seaside town , it has been claimed			1
the mother of @entity5 , @entity5 , @entity6 – the former girlfriend of double child killer @entity8 – and kidnapper @entity9 are said to have homes close to each other in the resort			1
although their location can not be named for legal reasons , sightings of the notorious trio have already provoked comment on social networking sites			0
one wrote online : ‘ what did we do to deserve them ? ’ another resident said : ‘ it ’s incredible , even bizarre that they are all living here			2
everyone is talking about it			0
’ the town dubbed the ‘ monsters - by - the - sea resort ’ has a ready supply of low - cost housing			1
it also has a high turnover of visitors and casual workers which should make it harder to identify ex-convicts			0
but this has not prevented residents from recognising their infamous faces			0
@entity48 , 38 , who provided a false alibi to @entity8 after he killed ten - year - old schoolgirls @entity6 and @entity6 in 2002 , has already been moved from one address because of the reaction of people living in the area			1
her ex-boyfriend is still serving a minimum jail term of 40 years			0
@entity48 , who served 21 months in jail , was granted a lifetime anonymity order by the @entity60 ten years ago which bars the identification of her whereabouts or her new identity			0
she is one of only four offenders ever to get a new identity at the expense of the taxpayer			0
following her release from prison in may 2004 , she had dental work in an attempt to change her appearance			0
@entity9 , 39 , who faked the kidnap of her own daughter to claim £ 50,000 reward money has also been seen in the seaside resort earlier this year she married her long - term boyfriend who is said to be ‘ besotted ’ , despite knowing about her past			1
in october 2011 she gave birth to a son , who is unlikely to ever know his mother ’s real identity due to the strict terms of the order			2
she is apparently working for ten hours a week in one of the resort ’s shops			2
one person who claimed he was served by her told the @entity93 : ‘ it suddenly clicked who she was			0
’ also living in the town is @entity96 , 33 , who let her 17 - month - old son @entity97 be tortured to death			1
she was released from prison a year ago after being jailed in 2009 and now lives in a two - bedroom flat			2
when she was granted parole , @entity96 begged for an anonymity order , a flat near @entity104 ’s seaside attractions and round - the - clock police protection , but ministers refused			1
@entity48 , 38 , served 21 months in jail for providing @entity8 with a false alibi after he murdered two schoolgirls @entity8 was given a double life sentence after he was convicted of the murder of @entity6 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) @entity6 was sentenced to 21 months in prison in 2003 for perverting the course of justice			1
she provided @entity8 , who she was dating at the time , with a false alibi after he killed @entity6 and @entity6 in 2002			1
@entity48 , was the girls ' teaching assistant at @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120			0
her failure to expose @entity8 's lies in the early stages of the investigation meant that police initially eliminated him as a suspect			0
it took the police nearly two weeks to arrest and charge him			0
the court accepted that @entity48 had only lied to the police to protect @entity8 because she believed his claims of innocence and so found her not guilty of assisting an offender			2
instead she was given a grant of £ 750 to decorate and furnish a flat elsewhere , £ 400 a month housing benefit and jobseekers ’ allowance			2
last week the 24 - stone junk food addict , who is still under the supervision of probation officers , was said to be unhappy after being recognised at a @entity146 surgery in the resort			1

the 39 - year - old mother of seven served four years in jail , and will remain on licence for the rest of her eight - year sentence			1
when she was released , she was given a makeover to prevent her being recognised			0
she lives under an assumed name and has signed on at the local @entity163			0
a resident on one of the resort ’s estates where she apparently lives said : ‘ she has put on so much weight that you ca n’t fail to notice her			2
i would n’t be surprised if she was 30 stone			0
’ yesterday criminal justice expert @entity171 said : ‘ normally offenders are dispersed			0
certain seaside towns have disproportionate numbers living far from home to maintain their anonymity			1
but i have never heard of three high - profile offenders in the same area , it ’s too risky			2
’ a @entity183 spokesman said yesterday : ‘ we have some of the toughest measures in the world to manage serious offenders in the community and public protection is always our top priority			0

the girl was found in a house which belonged to @entity211 , uncle of @entity9 - the boyfriend of the kidnapped girl 's mother			1
her disappearance sparked a major missing person operation and it was compared to the police search for @entity218 when she gave evidence she denied having anything to do with her daughter 's disappearance , claiming that @entity9 told her to ' take the blame '			1
she said she did so because she was scared of him			0
@entity5 was jailed for five years in 2009 after admitting causing or allowing her son @entity97 's death			1
