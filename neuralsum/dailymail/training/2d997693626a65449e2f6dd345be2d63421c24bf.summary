at times during the summer , @entity0 looked like a club recently visited by @entity2			1
the fact they now sit inside the top four has shocked even their own players , with @entity6 admitting he never imagined they would recover so quickly from such drastic surgery			2
it was telling , also , that the @entity9 claimed : ' i ’m happy here , i ’m fully focused on @entity0 and there is no problem '			2
it 's some statement from a player who pouted about being kept in the summer when other leading lights were getting big moves elsewhere			0
@entity18 strikes for @entity0 after they had struggled for 41 minutes against ten men @entity6 tackles @entity21 's @entity20 as @entity0 continued their strong start but @entity0 's run of three @entity25 wins has lifted much of the gloom , even if the latest in that streak was arguably their weakest performance of the season			1
@entity0 laboured for 41 minutes against 10 men before @entity18 scored the 80th - minute winner and gave @entity33 cause to remind supporters ' it is very early in the season '			1
@entity6 has been here before , having started last season strongly , but believes it is key that the new squad make a better fist of the winter fixtures			1
he said : ' it ’s a surprise to have got off to the best ever start in the league after going through so many changes in the summer			0
@entity6 wanted to leave @entity0 over the summer but now says he is happy to be at the club @entity0 have failed to score in only one of their past 16 league away games			1
' the coaching staff changed , a lot of players left so of course it ’s great for us to be in such a good position after five games , but it ’s only five games of a long season and we need to keep going			0
' we had a very good start last year as well but it was difficult after going through a hard time in december and after that it was difficult to get back up the league			1
we ’re going to try to be stronger in that period			0
' he added : ' the group is closer after the summer , a lot of people were saying that @entity0 would struggle this season because we lost so many players			2
@entity69 is sent off for a second bookable offence handing the momentum to the @entity0 ' but we got together as a group after the transfer window shut and we said , “ right lads , it ’s us now , we ’re going to spend this year together and we need to show everyone that is doubting us that we can do something great ”			0
we are doing it so far			0
' @entity21 manager @entity79 was left bemused by referee @entity80 , even if he did not object to @entity82 's red card			1
he said : ' his ( @entity80 ) performance , in terms of consistency on his decisions was very , very poor , extremely poor			0
in terms of consistency , it blew my mind at times			0
' @entity79 did not disagree with the decision but described the referee 's overall performance as ' very poor '			2

@entity0 beat 10 - man @entity21 1 - 0 to go second in the @entity25
but @entity6 wary after *similarly* good start last season
