how was @entity0 for you last year ? did you both snuggle up at the end of the evening , luxuriating in each other 's arms , whispering sweet nothings ? or did it end in a huge , stonking row with both of you on your sides , staring stonily at opposite walls ? @entity0 is one of the two days in the year that couples argue the most , this is because we are often left disappointed , here @entity14 explains why he 's not living up to your expectations if it 's the latter , you 're not alone			1
@entity0 and @entity20 are the two nights of the year couples are most likely to argue			1
why ? expectations are high - and men and women 's idea of romance are streets apart			2
make this @entity29 's run smoother by seeing things from a different perspective ... 1			2
he did n't send flowers to work why is it infinitely better for a huge , expensive bunch of flowers to arrive at the office rather than be delivered in person by him ? the show off factor , of course			1
everyone wants to look like the most adored person in the office and what if everyone except you got sent flowers ? good reasons why he did n't : from being low on funds to feeling intimidated by the way you look there are plenty of reasons why he is n't conforming to your idea of the perfect @entity57 's date 2			1
he did n't book the right restaurant there are three @entity62 ' choices that go down well			0
dinner in your ' special ' restaurant - where you met or he proposed or something else significantly romantic happened			2
dinner in the hottest place in town ( so you can boast the next day ) or dinner somewhere expensive			0
his ' let 's give @entity75 the finger and head to the local pizza joint ! ' suggestion does not go down well			0
good reasons why he did n't : @entity14 says that it 's important to bear in mind that his definition of romance is n't necessarily yours 3			1
he did n't tell you how @entity88 your hair 's blow - dry glossy , you spent two week 's salary on your dress , your shoes are so high , your little toe 's already throbbing - and all he says after a quick once - over is ' hi ! @entity96			2
' would it kill him to say ' you look better than @entity99 - on a good day ' ? good reasons why he did n't : 4			1
the present did n't cost enough ' it 's the thought that counts ' might apply when it 's your five - year - old niece lovingly pressing an old sweet wrapper into your hand for @entity109			1
but a hell of a lot of women think the more money he spends , the more he loves them			2
good reasons why he did n't spend up big : 5			0
he was n't affectionate enough you 're smack bang in the middle of a packed restaurant , surrounded by tons of couples who are all over each other			1
he 's not even holding your hand across the table or playing footsie			0
why he is n't : 6			0
he did n't say romantic things on every other day of the year , he 's always coming out with the cutest , nicest comments about how much he adores you			1
on the day when he 's supposed to , nada			1
one strained ' i love you ' and that was that			0
why he did n't : 7			0
he did n't propose you 're checking your @entity137 glass , digging around in the chocolate fondant with your spoon , eyeing off his jacket pocket to see if it 's bulging			0
where is he hiding that damn ring ? why he did n't : it really does n't mean he does n't love you , if he does n't make a fuss on @entity0			2
some guys are just conscientious objectors to the concept and , let 's be honest here , it takes little effort to call and order a bunch of red roses			1
there are infinitely better ways to express love and his definition of romance is n't necessarily yours			0
one of my all time favourite research statistics is the study where men in long - term relationships were asked to do something romantic for their wives			0
forty percent washed her car ! i rest my case			0
for inspired @entity0 ideas on what to buy , see @entity14 's gift guide suggestions for him and her .			1

@entity0 is one of the two nights a year couples argue the most
this is because we have *massive* expectations and are left disappointed
@entity14 explains exactly why he might make *mistakes* this *saturday*
because you work with women who date *bankers* and if he ca n't *compete* , he figures you **'d** prefer his more modest bunch handed over **private*ly* .
because he *baulked* at paying a delivery fee that 's *tripled* for one day of year .
because it seemed more *practical* to give them to you himself , since he was seeing you that night .
because it 's *excruciating* to have to sit there and look loving and say all the right things in a restaurant he feels *comfortable* in , let alone one where he 's *terrified* he ****'ll**** pick up the wrong fork .
he ca n't afford it .
he figured cooking a meal for you himself was more special .
you seriously do give @entity99 a run for her money and he 's *suddenly* *paranoid* he 's not good - looking enough for you .
he clocked you **'ve** gone to a lot of effort to look good and *worried* the present is n't right / expensive enough / you 're upset because he did n't send flowers to work .
he actually prefers you in your old *skinny* jeans and a t - shirt . you do n't seem like you ' all done up ' .
he ca n't afford it and ca n't justify *hiking* up the *credit* card even higher when he 's likely to need it for important things . like rent .
he *secretly* *suspects* you 're a gold digger and wants to test whether you 're with him for his money by not being *extravagant* .
he did n't have a clue what to buy so *procrastinated* - and ended up in @entity243 half an hour before you were *due* to meet .
he 's *inwardly* *cringing* at how forced everyone else looks .
he feels that if he follows suit , he ****'ll**** look forced . or *clich√©d* . or just plain stupid . besides he can feel you turning into ms @entity250 and he 's scared he ****'ll**** be *rebuffed* and look even more *idiotic* .
he feels so self - conscious in this environment , he 's scared he ****'ll**** laugh .
see above . surrounded by all the cheesy hearts and pink *balloons* and red roses , he 's already *suffocating* in sentiment .
he thinks anything he says will seem *disingenuous* - that he 's only saying it because he 's supposed to .
he resents being told to do something romantic on a certain day of the year just because society dictates it .
he did n't think you **'d** want to share your *anniversary* with *millions* of other couples .
he 's *planning* on doing it somewhere *private* and more meaningful than in front of a room full of *strangers* .
you **'ve** only been dating two months .
