referees ' chief @entity0 has called for video technology to be trialled after the latest case of mistaken identity saw the wrong @entity6 player sent off at @entity7			1
@entity8 was dismissed after just 89 seconds of the @entity6 ' defeat for a foul on @entity11 that was actually committed by team - mate @entity12			1
referee @entity13 later apologised for the error while a furious @entity6 manager @entity15 demanded the introduction of two manager challenges per game			1
@entity13 sent off @entity6 's @entity8 for a challenge actually committed by @entity12 referees ' chief @entity0 has called for video technology to be trialled in the wake of that blunder @entity6 defender @entity12 ( right ) makes the original challenge on @entity25 just outside the area the @entity28 striker heads to the ground under @entity12 's clumsy challenge but managed to get back up @entity11 continues but @entity8 comes in with a challenge of his own from the opposite angle inside the area @entity11 goes to ground again under @entity8 's challenge , leading to the dismissal of the @entity6 player @entity39 showed the incident from referee @entity13 's perspective , with no 25 @entity12 the closest to him @entity13 's blunder is the third case of mistaken identity in a calendar year following @entity47 's dismissal of @entity49 's @entity48 for bringing down @entity51 striker @entity50 last month and a red card for @entity54 's @entity53 , who was sent off by @entity55 when it was @entity56 who had handled a shot from @entity59 's @entity58 last march			1
@entity0 , general manager of the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) , acknowledged that now was the time to test replays			1
' i think football as a whole has to look at how we can enhance refereeing performances through the use of technology , ' he said			0
' we 've been open - minded to things like the goal - decision system which has made a great difference and a great benefit to referees in the @entity76			1
' we need to see what other technology can be used to get refereeing decisions more accurate			0
' @entity0 , speaking to @entity80 , added that he had spoken to @entity13 since his gaffe but would not confirm whether he would be selected for the next round of @entity76 matches			1
city went on to win the match 3 - 0 as they try to keep their @entity76 title hopes alive until the final day following @entity8 's dismissal @entity7 ensured a miserable week , which included defeats to @entity89 and a @entity91 exit in @entity92 , ended on a high at a sunny @entity93			1
in a one - sided encounter that often resembled a training ground match of attack versus defence @entity11 's first goal for the home side , a neat finish from close range , set them on their way on 27 minutes			0
a horrendous defensive mix - up allowed @entity105 to tap in @entity7 's 1,000th @entity76 goal before the break and @entity108 deflected substitute @entity110 's low drive home to complete a dark afternoon for the @entity113 visitors			1
the win , which featured 43 shots , eased some of the pressure on @entity7 boss @entity118 amid reports he will be sacked in the summer if his side end the season trophyless			2
ex-chelsea midfielder @entity122 , who started the match in place of the injured @entity125 , defended the @entity126			0
' he has been a pleasure to work with and he 's a very good man , ' he said			0
' he 's a very experienced manager , a very good manager , and i do n't think there is any finger - pointing at any individual for the recent form			2
' @entity122 has proved himself to be a readily capable deputy in midfield for the injured @entity125 @entity122 , who will join sister club @entity134 at the end of the season , admitted tough questions may well be asked in the summer			0
' judgements will be made at the end of the season and that is fair enough , ' he added			2
@entity118 himself dismissed claims that @entity59 would not surrender their six point lead at the summit			0
after joking : ' please , no questions about the sack , ' he said ' i do n't think they are a winning machine all the time			0
' i am sure form now until the end of the season every team will drop points			0
' you never know what will happen when you have to play for another 24 points			0
' @entity7 boss @entity118 is under pressure to deliver some silverware at the @entity93			2
