@entity0 has said that the cost of testing for breast cancer genes ' remains an obstacle for many women '			1
the actress , who underwent a double mastectomy in 2013 , was referring to a genetic test that currently costs more than $ 3,000 ( £ 2,000 )			0
now a @entity10 - based start - up is offering an at - home @entity12 saliva test that detects the same gene mutations but is priced at only $ 249 ( £ 167 )			1
a @entity10 - based start - up is offering an at - home @entity12 saliva test to detect the same gene mutations priced at just $ 249 ( £ 167 )			1
it tests for mutations in @entity21 and @entity22 it tests for mutations in @entity21 and @entity22 , along with 17 other markers , all of which are linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer			1
women with a mutation in @entity21 have a lifetime risk of up to 80 percent for developing breast cancer and up to a 50 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer			1
the company behind the test , @entity38 , was founded by @entity39 , a former cancer researcher at @entity41 and @entity42 , a former engineer at @entity43 and @entity44			2
' we founded color because we want to give every person the opportunity to understand their genetic risk of cancer , ' said dr @entity52			2
@entity0 recently said that the cost of testing for breast cancer genes ' remains an obstacle for many women '			1
the actress , who is pictured here with her husband @entity60 , was referring to a genetic test that currently costs more than $ 3,000 ( £ 2,000 ) ' this important information gives people the opportunity to work with their physician to manage their risk and make key life choice			0
' to get hold of the test , a physician will need to order it online , with the patient receiving a kit at home			0
the kit has instructions on how to take a sample of saliva and send it back to a central lab for processing			1
' we want to make sure that there is always a physician involved , ' the founders told @entity85			0
@entity38 is currently available in 45 states and is hoping to comply with regulations required in @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			2
however , the test has received mixed responses with some saying it might not be useful , and could even be harmful			0
' i worry it will give women information that we really do n't know what it means - and that women will make very difficult choices that turn out to be incorrect , ' @entity96 of the @entity97 told @entity105			0
' if we have more women who believe they are at increased risk , ' @entity96 says , ' we will have more women removing healthy body parts			0
' we really do not have enough information to base this kind of expansion of this kind of testing			0
' color genomics did not immediately respond to @entity116 for comment			1
researchers found coffee can stop the growth of tumours in women who have already been treated with the drug tamoxifen just two cups of coffee a day could halve the risk of breast cancer returning in women recovering from the disease , a study has found			1
researchers found coffee can stop the growth of tumours in women who have already been treated with the drug tamoxifen			0
@entity134 is the main hormonal therapy drug given to women who have not been through the menopause , and is usually taken for five years or longer after treatment for breast cancer			2
most breast cancer tumours rely on the hormone oestrogen to grow , and tamoxifen blocks oestrogen from reaching the cancer cells			2
this means the cancer either grows more slowly or stops growing altogether			0
as part of the study , @entity147 and @entity148 researchers looked at data from 1,090 breast cancer patients , in a follow up of a similar study carried out two years ago			1
they found that more than 500 women who had been treated with tamoxifen , and those that had drunk at least two cups of coffee a day , had only half the risk of their cancer returning than those who drank less coffee , or none at all .			0

@entity165 is being offered by @entity10 - based start up color genomics
it tests for *19* gene mutations linked to ovarian and breast cancer
works by asking patients to send back a sample of saliva to a central lab
@entity165 is available in 45 @entity179 states and needs to be ordered by a physician
