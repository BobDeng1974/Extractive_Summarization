by @entity0 published : 17:48 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 11:04 est , 22 july 2013 @entity1 leaving her home in @entity3			0
originally from @entity4 , she is one of a new breed of landlords who move paying tenants into unclaimed properties after pensioner @entity11 died last year , leaving no surviving relatives , his neighbours wondered what would become of his house			1
they kept an eye on the £ 275,000 home and tended the front and rear gardens to make sure the property looked occupied			1
then , after the terrace house had been empty for 13 months , an ‘ @entity23 ’ arrived on the scene and claimed it			1
but @entity1 was not even a distant relative of the late owner			0
instead she was an opportunist who changed the locks and announced she would be putting tenants into the property			1
the brazen miss @entity1 even stuck a notice in the front window proclaiming : ‘ private property – keep out ’			1
astonishingly , police deemed that she had not committed any crime , but the @entity37 ’s department , which is responsible for the empty property , changed the locks again to keep miss @entity1 out			1
the house , according to her own boasts , is not the first property she has appropriated			1
she represents a new trend in property developers , who scour government websites to locate the houses of those who have died without leaving a will			1
college lecturer mr @entity11 , an only child , lived with his parents in the house in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity3			1
his father @entity50 died at the age of 76 in 1988 and his mother @entity52 , 84 , followed in 1999			1
mr @entity11 , who was unmarried , stayed in the house until his death in april 2012 , when he was 72			1
the homes of those who die intestate , like mr @entity11 , pass into the hands of the @entity37			0
known as ‘ bona vacantia ’ – @entity59 for ‘ ownerless property ’ – they are advertised on the department ’s website , which is updated weekly , making it easy for squatters to find them and move in			1
if no one claims them they revert to state ownership and are sold			0
last year the government earned £ 12million from unclaimed estates			0
two months ago , miss @entity1 descended on @entity48 , where she asked a 14 - year - old girl if the house was unoccupied			1
the empty £ 275,000 house which miss @entity1 attempted to claim the following evening she returned with a locksmith who changed the front door locks			2
@entity77 asked under whose authority she was acting after she apparently told the locksmith that she was a ‘ solicitor ’			0
she gave them a sheet of paper which quoted snippets from the @entity37 ’s website about ‘ bona vacantia ’ properties			0
she wrote on the paper : ‘ i would rather see an empty house brought back into productive use than left to rot without even any insurance			2
’ she said she would soon be moving paying tenants into the house , with rents being paid to her			1
miss @entity1 told neighbours that she had ‘ lots of other bona vacantia ’ properties and one said : ‘ she was so brazen			2
we asked her if she was a relative and all she would say was , “ no , but i am legal			2
i am doing you a huge favour by putting tenants into the house ”			1
’ after she left the shocked neighbours contacted their mp , @entity104 , and the @entity37			2
@entity1 , pictured in her car			0
she changed the locks and announced she would be putting tenants into mr @entity11 ' property mr @entity104 , @entity109 member for @entity110 , got in touch with police , and the @entity37 employed another locksmith to change the new locks			1
miss @entity1 , who runs three companies – @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 – lives in @entity119 , near @entity120 , @entity3			0
when approached by the @entity121 she said : ‘ i am not prepared to discuss anything with you			0
what i do is my business			0
’ solicitor @entity126 , former chairman of the @entity129 ’s @entity128 section , said : ‘ whatever this lady says it appears that she tried to steal a house rather like someone might try and steal a car			2
‘ while trespass is a civil matter i would have thought by breaking and entering into this property she has broken the criminal law			2
impersonating a solicitor is also a criminal matter			0
’ a @entity143 spokesman said : ‘ officers assessed the information available and no criminal offence was apparent			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity37 said : ‘ the property was very quickly secured and it was made clear to the person who attempted to take possession of it what the consequences of their actions could be			2
‘ therefore , no formal civil or criminal action needed to be taken , but this will not always be the case			0
’ the popular @entity160 tv show @entity161 follows probate researchers trying to track down people who may be entitled to inherit estates			0
around 30million people in the @entity166 – half the population – have not made a will .			0
