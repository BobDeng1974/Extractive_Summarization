by @entity0 @entity2 president @entity1 stunned a @entity4 court on monday by admitting he had evaded taxes of € 18.5million using a secret @entity8 bank account - more than five times the amount on a prosecutors ' charge sheet			1
once one of @entity13 's most admired managers , @entity1 apologised and appealed for leniency at the start of a trial in a case that shocked the country and prompted other tax dodgers to turn themselves in			2
state prosecutor @entity20 read the charge sheet in which he was accused of evading € 3.5m ( £ 2.9m ) in taxes - on undeclared income of € 33.5m between 2003 and 2009			1
support : @entity2 fans hold up placards of @entity1 outside his trial for tax evasion @entity1 , who turned @entity2 into a success on and off the pitch before his fall from grace , could be sentenced to between five and 10 years in jail if convicted of evading more than € 1m in taxes			1
' i 'm glad that this is all out in the open now , ' 62 - year - old @entity1 , who was wearing a dark suit and smiling nervously , told the court			2
' i deeply regret my wrongdoing			0
i 'm doing everything i can to put this unhappy chapter behind me			0
' @entity1 , who as a player won the @entity42 with @entity13 in 1974 and as manager led @entity2 to two champions @entity44 and many domestic league titles , is hoping the voluntary disclosure will help him avoid jail			1
he paid € 10m to the tax office in january 2013 , and says he voluntarily alerted tax authorities then about his @entity8 bank account and undeclared income			1
what is unclear is whether he informed the tax office about his offence early enough or comprehensively enough to avoid jail			2
downcast : @entity2 president @entity1 arrives at court in his trial for tax evasion worried ? @entity1 has a chat with his lawyer @entity62 before the start of the trial @entity4 legal experts say it appears unlikely he fulfilled those requirements			1
about 100 journalists and spectators packed into the courtroom to witness the start of the four - day trial			0
outside the courtroom @entity2 fans held up posters expressing their support for @entity1 and pleading for leniency			1
@entity1 told the court he used his secret account for more than 50,000 speculative trades in financial markets such as foreign exchange and derivatives from 2001 to 2010			1
he said he lost € 1m between 2003 and 2009			0
' it was always clear to me that the account was mainly for gambling , ' he said			0
' it was a real kick , pure adrenaline			0
i lost track of it all			0
everything was a real mess in the end			0
' early words : judge @entity95 speaks during the start of the trial of the former @entity2 manager @entity1 said he was disappointed that the state prosecutors raided his house and arrested him before charging him with tax evasion after his voluntary disclosure in 2013			1
he said he had received death threats when the public learned of his case			0
' the consequences of all this for me and my family have been a disaster , ' said @entity1 , and he had donated more than five million to charity in past years and paid more than € 50m euros in taxes in @entity13 , he said			1
' i 'm not a social parasite , ' he said in response to the criticism that by evading taxes he cheated other taxpayers			2
the case against @entity1 , and other celebrities caught or confessing to tax evasion , led thousands to preemptively pay back taxes in the hope of avoiding prosecution , and helped change the public 's perception of tax evasion as a misdemeanour to it being seen as a serious crime			2
picturesque : a view of the regional court in @entity130 where the trial is taking place legend : @entity1 played over 200 games for @entity2 scoring 86 goals in his career therer plenty of information : all the files for the trial of @entity1 in the @entity4 court @entity142 , a leading feminist , chancellor @entity145 's party treasurer @entity144 , @entity147 's culture minister @entity146 and former top journalist @entity148 have been in the public spotlight for tax evasion issues			1
