' he was a humanitarian worker who went with an aid convoy organised by @entity49 groups to provide support to refugees in @entity52			2
' he was doing good and i think it speaks volumes about @entity3 that this is the way they are treating somebody who went out there to help their people and support their communities in their time of need			0
' the audio recording came after the @entity18 and @entity67 allies began bombing parts of @entity52 where @entity3 have gained a foothold , reportedly including the city of @entity71 where it is thought the former @entity73 taxi driver is being held			1
mr @entity36 , who appeared at the end of a video of the murder of @entity12 aid worker @entity77 , was kidnapped last december in @entity52 by @entity3 militants and mrs @entity79 has again pleaded for them to release him			1
in a statement issued by the @entity81 , mrs @entity79 said : ' we are at a loss [ to understand ] why those leading @entity84 can not open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding @entity36 's imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life ...

' the foreign secretary condemned the @entity9 terror group for holding @entity12 aid worker , @entity36 , 47 the militant extremist group has previously released footage showing the killings of @entity18 journalists @entity100 and @entity102 as well as mr @entity77			2

lord @entity137 said : ' at the public level , not to have commented in that way would have kept uncertainty in the minds of terrorists			0
they would have remained concerned ... ' not to have revealed our hand as openly might have been a different course of action to take			0
