by @entity1 reporter published : 17:45 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 02:56 est , 19 february 2013 the @entity3 administration has radical plans for a multi-billion dollar , decade - long study into the workings of human brain , it was revealed today			1
according to the @entity11 , the @entity10 would be a collaboration between federal agencies , private foundations and leading scientists			1
advocates for the project hope that exhaustive research into the brain 's neurons would produce insights that could be used to understand mental illness , help treat diseases like @entity23 's and even enable advances in artificial intelligence			1
others have criticized putting large amounts of money into just one project and claimed that the study lacks clear goals			1
advocates for the project hope that exhaustive research into the brain would produce insights that could be used to understand mental illness , help treat diseases like @entity37 's , and even enable advances in artificial intelligence details are not yet final but the huge study is expected to be mentioned in the president 's budget proposal next month			1
it still is n't known how much federal money will be needed or proposed for the project in straitened financial times			0
a comprehensive map of brain activity has similar scope to the @entity50 , which recorded all the genes in human @entity52 and was completed in 2003 at a cost of $ 3.8 billion			1
the brain map could certainly also end up costing billions of dollars			0
the @entity11 quoted scientists involved in its planning who hoped that federal financing would be more than $ 300 million a year - amounting to more than $ 3 billion over ten years			1
in his @entity59 last week , president @entity3 described brain research as an example of how the government should ' invest in the best ideas			0
' ' today our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to @entity37 ’s , ' said mr @entity3			1
' they ’re developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs , devising new materials to make batteries 10 times more powerful			0
now is not the time to gut these job - creating investments in science and innovation ' the president said			0
in his @entity59 last week , president @entity3 described brain research as an example of how the government should ' invest in the best ideas			0
' @entity3 also described how the @entity50 returned $ 140 to the economy for every $ 1 of investment in research			2
the @entity11 reported on a federal study on the impact of the project that suggested that it had returned $ 800 billion by 2010			1
but there has also been criticism of the @entity10			1
the @entity90 referenced several @entity92 users who ' expressed concern about the feasibility of the @entity96 's goals and wondered whether this is the best use of federal resources			2
' @entity99 , a neurobiologist at @entity100 , tweeted : ' baffled by the @entity101			0
we do n't understand the fly brain yet			2
how will this come to anything ? ' @entity105 , a biologist at @entity106 , added : ' someone has to go to congress and explain why basic research is so important , not pander to them with big science c * * p. ' as reported by the @entity90 , @entity105 worked on the dna research project @entity113 and he has since argued against ' @entity115 ' research			0
' the lesson i learned from @entity113 is that projects like @entity113 are not a good idea , ' he wrote on his personal blog			0
' i think it is now clear that big biology is not a boon for individual discovery - driven science			2
ironically , and tragically , it is emerging as the greatest threat to its continued existence			0
' the project would be on a similar scale to the @entity50 where scientists like dr @entity132 , director of the @entity133 near @entity134 ( pictured ) mapped every gene of human dna			2

the @entity10 could cost over $ 300 million a year for a decade
advocates say it could help scientists understand mental illness
critics say the study lacks clear goals
