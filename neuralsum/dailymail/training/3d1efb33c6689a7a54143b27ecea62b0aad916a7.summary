by @entity0 the @entity2 billionaire playboy who offered nearly £ 40million to any man who could turn his homosexual daughter straight , has now doubled the ' dowry '			2
@entity6 raised the reward to hk $ 1billion ( £ 80million ) after thousands of eligible bachelors failed to convince his daughter @entity9 to marry any of them			1
the 77 - year - old property magnate insists that 34 - year - old @entity9 is ' still single ' despite the fact that she married her long - term partner @entity13 two years ago			1
he said that he did not want to interfere with his daughter ’s private life , but that he wanted her to have ' a good marriage and children '			2
in response , ms @entity6 said that although her wife had been left ' distraught ' by her father 's interview , she found it easier to ignore - even offering to comply with the terms , as long as the man in question donated a large part of the money to charity , and did not mind that she is already married			1
' i do n’t think my dad ’s offering of any amount of money would be able to attract a man i would find attractive , ' she told @entity50			0
definitely not single : @entity6 , right , and her partner @entity13 , have been together for nine years and married in @entity52 in 2012 in denial : @entity2 billionaire mr @entity6 , who claims to have slept with 10,000 women , still wants his daughter to marry a man - although he wo n't force her loving daughter : ms @entity6 says she does not think her father is offering the bounty out of evil or spite , but rather that he does not understand that homosexuality can not be changed as he is ' from another time ' ' alternatively , i would be happy to befriend any man willing to donate huge amounts of money to my charity @entity68 in @entity69 , provided they do n’t mind that i already have a wife			1
' third and lastly , thank you @entity73 , i love you too			0
' ‘ i 'm not saying that she 's not okay to be gay , ’ @entity6 told @entity74 20/20 in october 2012			1
‘ i mean it 's her own choice and her own tendency , but she should make sure she knows what she wants			2
maybe what she wants today is different [ than ] what she wants in the future			0
’ ms @entity6 married her long - term partner @entity84 in a church ceremony in @entity52 in early 2012 , but it was not until news of their union was printed in the @entity2 tabloids that her father promised the million @entity92 fortune to any potential male suitor able to walk @entity9 down the aisle			1
ms @entity6 had already told her father about her wedding , and said he was ‘ surprised and unpleasantly shocked , ’ but urged her not to make it public			2
deal : ms @entity6 offered to comply with the terms , as long as the man in question donated a large part of the ' reward ' to her charity , and did not mind that she already has a wife video : @entity9 reads some of her marriage proposals ... yes , she 's still close with her father ... when the plea for a man for @entity9 spread over the world , the offers came pouring in			1
‘ war veterans from the @entity115 , someone from @entity117 , from @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , really just from all over the world , ’ ms @entity6 said			2
' one @entity115 suitor wrote : " i ’m interested in the offer			0
i am a male person , who also happens to be gay "			0
' ms @entity6 , an executive director at her father ’s property development company , part - time pilot , and founder of anti-poverty charity @entity68 , has maintained throughout her father 's persistent quest that she knows he is only doing it out of love and concern			1
' i understand that he loves me , it ’s just he ’s from another time and it ’s difficult for him to understand the plight of the @entity141			0
' at the office it ’s business as usual			0
at family gatherings we hug and dance			0
and we just agree to disagree on what marriage is and family is			0
