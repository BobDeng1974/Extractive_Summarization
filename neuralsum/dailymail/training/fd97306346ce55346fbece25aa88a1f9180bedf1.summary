in an interview on @entity12 , @entity10 said that he would be responding to letters from @entity14 and @entity16 mp @entity15 ' very quickly '			1
tv regulator @entity17 has received 415 complaints about last week 's incident and has launched an investigation into it			1
he said : ' i think the way @entity37 interviewed the prime minister last thursday or that portion of the interview was wrong , was misguided			2
' i 'm not happy that this happened			0
we have editorial processes and checks in place and , to be honest with you , they were n't followed so i 'm not happy about that but i think the way we have tackled this and responded to this has been quick and decisive			2
' mr @entity10 said the channel would ' co-operate fully ' with the @entity17 investigation			1
he said he was unable to discuss the disciplinary action taken against those involved in the production but the matter had been taken ' extremely seriously '			0
he added : ' i 've spoken to @entity4 myself			0
he apologised for it extremely fully and extremely quickly and i discussed that with him and i think he 's under no illusions that this was a lapse in @entity2 journalism ; this is something we should n't have done			1
' the prime minister takes the card and responds with firm words warning of a ' witch hunt ' that meant prominent people were being wrongly accused of child abuse simply because they were gay the prime minister was visibly taken aback by the stunt and some viewers said names were clearly visible on the piece of paper handed to the prime minister warning : @entity78 , @entity14 's solicitor , has said they know the identity of everyone who has defamed him online former @entity83 controller mr @entity10 , who resigned from the corporation in 2007 after misleading footage appearing to show the @entity86 storming out of a photoshoot was used in a trailer , added that @entity4 ' stays on air '			1
his interview follows a demand by mr @entity15 , who is chairman of the @entity93 , that @entity2 reveals who was involved in the decision to show mr @entity5 the list during the programme			2
appearance : @entity4 was on the show today but looked subdued throughout in a letter to mr @entity10 , he said : ' as you are aware , during the interview mr @entity4 presented the prime minister with a list of names of individuals alleged to have been involved in paedophilia which it had taken him ' about three minutes ' to obtain from the internet			1
' i understand that mr @entity4 has apologised for the fact that some of the names might have been visible and that @entity17 is also considering a complaint about this matter			1
' however , there has been widespread concern expressed about the decision itself to confront the prime minister with such a list			0
' i would therefore be grateful if you could say whether or not it is the view of @entity2 that this represented responsible journalism in the public interest			0
' i would also like to know at what level the decision was taken , what legal advice was sought , and what subsequent consideration has been given to the appropriateness of this broadcast			0
' @entity4 has apologised personally after the list of names - understood to be @entity16 figures - was briefly exposed on screen			0
an @entity2 spokesman said : ' last thursday we began an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the mistake on that day 's @entity37 programme , for which both @entity4 and @entity2 apologised			2
' this investigation has now concluded and the appropriate disciplinary action has been taken			0
' we sincerely apologise because the way in which the issue was raised was clearly wrong and should have been handled differently			0
we have taken steps to make sure our editorial processes are always properly followed , which was not the case in this instance , and to ensure such an error will not be made again			0
' what 's your reaction to @entity17 saying they 'll investigate @entity2 ? it 's very embarrassing is n't it ? pf : ' well let me say straight away that i think the way @entity37 interviewed prime minister last thursday or that portion of the interview was wrong , was misguided			1
on that day @entity4 issued a statement apologising			0
we launched an investigation straight away			0
that concluded today , less than a week from the interview			2
we 've issued a fuller statement and we 've taken disciplinary action			0
' but you say disciplinary action but @entity4 was still on air today			0
what sort of disciplinary action ? pf : ' i ca n't discuss in detail what disciplinary action we 've taken against those involved in the production			1
i 've spoken to @entity4 myself			0
he apologised for it extremely fully and extremely quickly and i discussed that with him and i think he 's under no illusions that this was a lapse in @entity2 journalism ; this is something we should n't have done			1
' this is terribly embarrassing for @entity2			0
how could this have happened ? @entity183 want to know â€¦ @entity187 : ' in live television all sorts of things could happen , that does n't mean they should happen and when something goes wrong along these lines we take it very seriously			1
i 'm confident this sort of thing wo n't happen again			1
in the meantime that 's what we 've been looking into in more detail			2
' no tougher punishments , no suspensions things like that ? pf : ' i ca n't discuss the details of the disciplinary action but i can assure you that we think it 's appropriate and we have taken this extremely seriously			1
' and you 've had a legal letter from @entity14 ? pf : ' we have had a letter from @entity14 today and we will respond to that very quickly and i 've also had a letter from @entity15 and i will respond to that quickly as well			1
as you say , @entity17 have launched an investigation and of course we will co-operate fully in that investigation			1
' and you 're happy that all the steps that should have been taken for that programme were taken ? where was the editor ? where were the production staff ? why was @entity4 thrusting this list at the prime minister ? @entity187 : ' i 'm not happy that this happened			0
we have editorial processes and checks in place and to be honest with you they were n't followed so i 'm not happy about that but i think the way we have tackled this and responded to this has been quick and decisive			2
i 'm happy we wo n't see something like this happen again on this morning or any other @entity2 programme ' @entity4 stays on air ? @entity187 : ' @entity4 stays on air			1
