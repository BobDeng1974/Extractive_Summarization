disgraced @entity1 sergeant @entity0 , 55 , of @entity10 , @entity9 admitted a series of rapes and child sex attacks relating to one victim at @entity15 last month			1
but it emerged today @entity0 was arrested eight years ago for taking ' up - skirt ' pictures of children with a spy pen in a branch of @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
at the time he was given a conditional discharge after pleading guilty to a minor public order offence at @entity26 and @entity27 in 2005 - but all of his most serious abuse happened after this offence			1
because he was not charged with a sexual offence , his name was not placed on the sex offenders ' register			1
he was allowed to keep his job and it was not until he admitted abusing a girl in court last month that he was dismissed from his role at the force 's headquarters			1
the victim , who can not be named for legal reasons , reported the years of abuse - which culminated in being raped as an adult - earlier this year			1
a court heard @entity0 's abuse of the girl escalated and all of the most serious attacks happened after his arrest for the photos			1
sentencing him to 14 and a half years in prison , judge @entity48 said he had used his victim as a ' sexual toy '			2
he placed @entity51 on the sex offenders ' register for life			1
he said : ' you have one previous conviction which has two worrying aspects : firstly , the nature of the offence and secondly , the fact you were convicted under public order legislation when quite clearly these were serious sexual offences			2
' you had armed yourself with a covert camera and were found taking pictures of children			2
why on earth you were not charged under the sexual offences act , i do not know			2
' whoever took that decision , it allowed you to carry on as a police officer			0
' the judge added that because he was convicted of a public order offence , nobody had looked more closely at @entity0 's relationship with children and a chance to detect his abuse was missed			1
@entity0 was jailed after admitting a series of rapes and child sex attacks at @entity15 ( pictured ) despite undergoing therapy to address his sexual deviancy , @entity0 carried on abusing his victim , who suffered significant psychological harm			1
judge @entity48 said that @entity0 's apparent cooperation with therapy showed how he was able to ' manipulate experts ' into believing he had an ordinary sex life			1
prosecutor @entity92 said the pictures taken in 2005 were of ' young children ' and there was some doubt over whether the worst of the images were found			0
@entity99 , mitigating , said @entity0 had agreed to undergo counselling in order to keep his job			2
his role with the police had not involved regular contact with children			0
@entity0 pleaded guilty to 13 offences - including three counts of rape , three counts of indecency with a child , various sexual assaults and taking an indecent photograph of a child - in november this year			1
he denied six other counts , which were left to lie on file			0
mr @entity92 told the court @entity0 started grooming the girl when she was nine			2
the court heard he would expose himself to her , show her pornography and take indecent photographs			2
' this was serious sexual assault , ' mr @entity92 said			0
' the abuse was more or less continuous and culminated in rape when she was a young adult			0
' his victim was unable to make a statement to the court , saying she was so distressed that even the thought of it made her physically sick			0
one witness who knew the victim described how her life had been ' ruined '			0
' she has never been able to integrate or make friends , ' he said			0
' he has shown himself to be lying and manipulative			0
' dressed in a black suit , @entity0 broke down in tears in the dock as details of his abuse were read out			2
referring to the latest offences , miss @entity99 said her client had been ' infatuated '			0
she said that , with expert help , there was no reason he should pose any further danger to the public			0
' he is very well aware of the shame he has brought on the police force and his 30 years of service are over , ' miss @entity99 said			1
@entity9 @entity1 have not yet responded to the judge 's comments			0
speaking after @entity0 was dismissed last month , deputy chief constable @entity157 said : ' this was an appalling crime where the victim was put through a horrendous ordeal over a prolonged period			1
' we want the public and our own employees to feel confident about raising concerns about the conduct of our officers and staff			0
' we will always investigate these cases thoroughly and ensure any offenders are brought to justice			0
' @entity173 , who heads the @entity175 's programmes for tackling sexual abuse , said : ' it seems quite incredible that this officer was n't charged first time around with a sexual offence			1
' if he had been it 's possible these later , more serious crimes could have been stopped sooner or even prevented in the first place			0
' the tragedy is that a young girl has suffered terribly at this man 's hands when he should not have been allowed the freedom to act in this appalling way			0
' this underlines the importance of taking all sex offences extremely seriously and making sure the right course of action is followed through			0
' it would only be right for the police authority to take a look at how he came to be charged with a minor offence all those years ago and to ensure it does n't happen again			1
