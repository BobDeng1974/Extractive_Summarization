when this hungry elephant realised that the only way was up , he refused to let his lack of physical height stop him from getting his lunch			1
the bull elephant was caught on camera standing on its hind legs , half - climbing up against a tree to reach the leaves up top			1
he looked more like a giraffe than an elephant as he stretched his trunk towards the succulent leaves in the tree			2
mr @entity23 , who is currently living in @entity29 , started taking pictures as a hobby four years ago but he was amazed to catch this hungry elephant on camera , acting just like a giraffe			1
mr @entity23 said : ' it was dawn , the forest was silent , the air full of dust and my three friends and i were alone			0
' all of a sudden we saw the bull elephant and we followed him for a while			2
dinner time : the elephant was spotted foraging for food in @entity26 , in the north of @entity28 @entity47 food : the elephant has his eye on the leaves at the top of the tree and starts to climb towards it success : the elephant grabs hold of one branch , left , and holds on tight to take it back down , right ' suddenly , he was up on his hind legs and it was quite a show to see a creature as massive as this standing on the back legs and pulling away an entire brance with his trunk like it was nothing			1
' it is very rare for elephants to stand on their back legs because of their weight			0
' i think it is really amusing and quite impressive to see have seen the elephant standing on its back legs and reaching up like a giraffe			0
' the elephant was straining for food because it is the dry season and low vegetation is scarce			0
