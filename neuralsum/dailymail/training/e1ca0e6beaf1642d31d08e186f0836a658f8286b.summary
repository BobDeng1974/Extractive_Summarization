by @entity0 scientists have developed a solid material so light it can be balanced atop the petals of a flower			1
researchers from @entity7 university in @entity8 , @entity9 , showed off their newly developed graphene aerogel by balancing a block of the stuff on a delicate cherry blossom			1
the sponge - like matter is made of freeze - dried carbon and graphene oxide and is the lightest solid material in the world			1
the lightest solid ever developed : a piece of graphene aerogel developed in a lab at @entity23 is placed on a cherry flower in @entity8 in east @entity9 's @entity7 province delicate : a comparison with this researcher 's hand reveals just how puny the flower is - yet it can comfortably hold the weight of the graphene substance balanced on top of it with a weight of just 0.16 miligrams per cubic centimeter , it is just twice the density of hydrogen - the simplest of all elements - and less dense than helium			1
first developed by two @entity43 scientists playing about with scotch tape at @entity45 , graphene has already been hailed as a ' wonder material ' that promises to transform the future			1
its discovery earned professors @entity50 and @entity51 a joint @entity52 in physics , with the committee making a special mention of the ' playfulness ' of their experiments , and a knighthood each			0
wondrous : a researcher lifts a piece of graphene aerogel by the static electricity on the glass stick in a lab at @entity23			1
the sponge - like matter is made of freeze - dried carbon and graphene oxide superlight : @entity72 , professor of the @entity73 at @entity23 , displays the newly - developed ultra-light solid material in its pure state , the substance is a two - dimensional crystal of pure carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice described by some as ' atomic chickenwire '			1
that makes it the thinnest material ever made			2
you would need to stack three million graphene sheets on top of each other to get a pile one milimetre high			2
but this unique structure makes it very light and strong , with a one - square - metre sheet weighing only 0.77 milligrams - yet strong enough to support the weight of a 4kg adult cat			2
a sheet of graphene as thin as clingfilm could hold the weight of an elephant			2
according to one calculation , an @entity100 would need to balance precariously on the end of a pencil to break through that same sheet			0
despite its strength , it is also extremely flexible and can be stretched by 20 per cent without any damage , and it 's almost transparent			0
it is also a superb conductor of electricity — far better than copper , traditionally used for wiring — and is the best conductor of heat on the planet			0
it is also , further research discovered , an incredible filter - it blocks all liquids and gases except water , which made for the potential for one stereotypically @entity43 experiment by its inventors			1
' just for a laugh , we sealed a bottle of vodka with our membranes and found that the distilled solution became stronger and stronger with time , ' said dr @entity133 , who co-authored a study describing the results last year			0
atomic chickenwire : in its pure state , the substance is a two - dimensional crystal of pure carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice			2
that makes it the thinnest material ever made , yet 200 times stronger than steel professors @entity50 and @entity51 serendipitously discovered graphene almost by accident while investigating the electrical properties of carbon graphite - the common material that pencils are made of			1
borrowing a technique used by microscopy researchers to clean the mineral before examining it close up , they found they could peel it into ever thinner flakes using scotch tape			0
after repeatedly sticking and peeling back the scotch tape they realised they could get down to the thinnest layer physically possible - just one atom thick			0
they then attached it to a silicon plate which allowed them to identify its tiny layers through a microscope			0
professors @entity50 ( left ) and @entity51 : discovering graphene in the course of research at @entity45 earned the pair a joint @entity52 in physics and a knighthood each @entity180 's discovery has triggered a boom for material science , with its potential applications appearing almost limitless			1
but most important of all , its core constituent , carbon , is the basic element of life , which means graphene could spur a new industrial revolution based on components that are biodegradable and sustainable			2
‘ we are talking of a number of unique properties combined in one material which probably has n’t happened before , ’ said professor @entity51 in 2011			0
‘ you might want to compare it to plastic			0
but graphene is as versatile as all the plastics put together			0
‘ it ’s a big claim , but it ’s not bold			0
that ’s exactly why there are so many researchers working on it			1
