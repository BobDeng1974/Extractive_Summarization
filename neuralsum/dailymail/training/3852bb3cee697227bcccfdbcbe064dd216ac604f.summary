proposals for ' fracking ' for shale gas at two sites in @entity4 should be refused , planning officers have recommended			1
@entity6 has published reports with recommendations on planning applications from shale company @entity10 to develop two new sites to explore for shale gas by drilling , fracking and testing the flow of gas			1
the council 's development control committee is due to make decisions next week on the planning applications for the two sites , at @entity20 , near @entity21 , and @entity22 , near @entity23 , both between @entity24 and @entity25			1
at the @entity22 site , the report said there would be an increase in traffic , particularly heavy goods vehicles , which would result in ' an unacceptable impact ' on rural roads and reduce road safety			0
if the council 's development control committee take the advice of their planning officers and turn down the applications , it will be seen as a major blow to efforts to get the @entity58 's shale gas and oil industry off the ground			1
@entity61 said today in a statement that it was ' very disappointed at the recommendation			0
' after an extraordinarily lengthy period of consultation and review of around seven months we are surprised that , at this late point , the planning team at @entity6 has raised objections about background noise for both sites			1
' we believe , supported by independent experts @entity76 , that we have come forward with measures that would mitigate the noise of drilling and fracturing and the proposed noise levels are within the limits set out in government guidance			0
' @entity10 wanted to explore two potential shale gas locations near @entity24 and @entity25 the company said it had supplied extra information regarding traffic routes for the @entity22 site , and believed it had addressed all the issues raised			1
' in the end the councillors on the development control committee will have to weigh the relatively minor impacts which affect only a small number of households and for which we have proposed adequate proposals for mitigation against the wider local and national economic and energy security benefits			1
' we will await the councillors ' decisions on both these applications and we believe that all of the limited issues that have been raised can be resolved			0
' the government is pushing for the development of a shale gas industry in the @entity58 , claiming it would create jobs and growth , reduce energy prices and cut the country 's reliance on gas imports			1
however , opponents have raised fears that the process causes earthquakes , can pollute water supplies , and could lead to inappropriate development in the countryside and damage house prices			0
hydraulic fracturing - or fracking - involves pumping water , chemicals and sand at high pressure underground to fracture shale rock and release the gas trapped in it			1
hundreds of protesters attended a six - day @entity131 camp last august near the proposed @entity21 site to campaign against shale gas extraction in the region by fracking			1
the controversial technique has led to fears that water supplies could be contaminated by toxic chemicals local authorities in @entity140 have also turned down applications from shale companies to explore for oil and gas in their areas			2
the @entity22 site should be refused planning permission because of the traffic issue and noise pollution , the planning officers said			2
they recommended refusing the @entity20 site on the noise issue alone			2
the report into the planning applications said shale gas exploration was in principle ' acceptable ' , and that the impacts on air quality , greenhouse gas emissions , landscape , water resources and seismic movements at the sites were low or could be lessened			1
but the proposed developments would lead to ' significant increase in night - time background noise levels '			0
' consequently it is likely that this would have significant adverse effects on the health and quality of life and lead to an unacceptable loss of residential amenity ' to nearby residents , the report says of each site			0
for the @entity22 application , the planning officers also raised concerns that it was in a ' very rural location ' served by small country lanes , and it should be turned down on those grounds too			2
they said : ' an assessment concludes that the increase in traffic , particularly hgv movements , would be severe , there would be a material impact on existing road users , particularly vulnerable road users and overall highway safety of which the potential is considered severe			0
environmental campaigners @entity193 hailed the recommendation to turn down the applications			0
@entity193 said that people in @entity4 were afraid of the risks caused by traffic , noise , water contamination and even the value of their homes if permission was granted for a similar site to this @entity193 energy campaigner @entity208 said : ' many thousands of people in @entity4 are seriously worried about the potential risks of fracking - traffic , noise , water contamination , air pollution , the value of their homes , to name just a few			0
' the concerns about noise and traffic brought up by the planners are a reminder that fracking could be a lot of pain for very little or no gain for communities in @entity4			2
' the council now faces a clear choice : they can listen to the planners , and the @entity4 residents that elected them - almost two - thirds of whom want a moratorium on fracking - or they can kowtow to the corporate and political interests keen to force through fracking at almost any cost			1
' the whole country is looking to @entity4 to protect its communities from the unnecessary risks that fracking plays with our futures			0
' @entity243 , spokesman for the @entity244 , a coalition of more than 500 businesses and academics , said : ' natural gas from @entity249 shale could be a massive opportunity for growth , investment , jobs and revenues in our region			2
' today 's announcements are obviously disappointing , but we await the decision of the development control committee next week , and call on councillors to grasp this opportunity to create the jobs and investment that @entity4 badly needs			1
' @entity265 's @entity249 campaigner @entity264 said : ' we are delighted that the planning officers have recognised the serious effects that these developments would have on neighbouring residents and have recommended that @entity6 refuses these applications			1
' councillors must now act on this and the tens of thousands of objections they have received and reject @entity10 's fracking applications next week			1
' only by doing so will they ensure that fracking is not allowed to cause further climate change while also putting communities and the local environment at risk			0
' @entity280 , partner at @entity282 and @entity284 's @entity283 said the decision in @entity4 could have long term implications to the viability of the industry			2
he said : ' this could be a potentially disastrous decision for the future of shale oil and gas development in the @entity58			1
' with oil and gas prices having fallen dramatically , the @entity294 industry is unlikely to have the appetite or backing to face the long and expensive approval process that is being required to carry out fracking in the @entity58			2
' one remaining glimmer of hope is the proposed underground access rights for shale oil and gas extraction included in the @entity304 , which is still going through @entity305			2
but even that is not a given			0
' despite the government â€™s desire to make change happen , there are only 100 - odd days to the election and the fracking related elements of the @entity304 have been fiercely debated and may well not make the statute books in the remaining time available			0
' a spokesperson for the @entity317 said : ' this is a matter for the local planning authority to determine			0
' the government can not comment on a live planning application			0
the government continues to support the development of the shale industry in the @entity58			0
' a spokesman for @entity326 ( @entity327 ) , who represent the industry said : ' it is disappointing that officials at @entity6 have come to this recommendation			0
' we need to review the detail of their advice before commenting further , but on first instance it appears that these are local planning matters specific to these sites rather than any issues that would have an obvious impact on other shale gas applications			1

@entity10 wants to drill for gas between @entity25 and @entity24
protesters have lodged several planning objections to both proposals
council officials have recommended the projects should be *abandoned*
planners are due to give their final decision by the end of the week
