by @entity0 - stokes @entity2 captain @entity1 has appointed @entity4 veteran @entity3 as a vice-captain for the @entity6 against holders @entity7 at @entity9 in @entity10			1
@entity3 , 47 , will join @entity11 and @entity12 as an assistant , though @entity1 pointed out that he could qualify for the team as a player if he wins this week 's @entity16 at @entity17			1
with just this week 's event remaining before the top nine on the @entity21 standings earn automatic selection for @entity9 , @entity3 languishes in 38th spot after playing the @entity4 on a part - time basis over the last two years			2
call - up : @entity3 has been named as @entity1 's third @entity2 vice-captain for the @entity6 in charge : @entity2 captain @entity1 will look to regain the @entity6 at @entity9 in @entity10 this year all smiles : @entity3 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) enjoy a laugh during a press conference in @entity17 ' @entity3 has been on the @entity6 team three times , he 's been on five @entity33 teams , ' @entity1 told reporters at @entity17 on wednesday on the eve of the @entity16			1
' @entity3 , when i called you , it was a pretty simple response from you : " i 'd love to be the vice-captain "			0
i appreciate that very quick and simple response that you made			0
' what @entity3 brings here is a great familiarity with the players who are on the @entity4 right now			2
he brings a great deal of understanding of who these players are and their capabilities			0
' hope : @entity3 could still feature at the @entity6 as a player if he wins the @entity16 @entity3 , a 12 - times winner on the @entity4 who has represented his country at the last three @entity52 , described his appointment as ' pretty special ' and ' a sign of the times '			1
' i feel old , ' the @entity2 smiled			0
' it 's a sign of the times , i guess , that you 're moving on in your career			0
' but it 's rewarding , too , to get a call from @entity1 , and to be a part of @entity11 and @entity12 ; to be a part of the whole team is pretty special			2
' it makes you feel like you 've been out here for a while , but also the respect of @entity1 and these other guys to even think about having me on the team			0
' experienced : @entity3 has won 12 times on the @entity4 and has played in the last three @entity2 @entity6 teams			1

@entity3 joins @entity11 and @entity12 as @entity1 's vice-captains
@entity2 captain @entity1 will be aiming to *reclaim* the @entity6 in @entity10
@entity3 could still qualify as a player if he win 's @entity16
but 47 - year - old is *struggling* in 38th - spot after playing *intermittently*
@entity3 has 12 wins on the @entity4 and has played last three @entity52
