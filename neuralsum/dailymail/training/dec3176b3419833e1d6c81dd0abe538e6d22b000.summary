by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 the @entity3 and @entity4 of @entity6 's first child is set to push prince @entity7 into fourth place in the line of succession to the throne - even if they have a girl			1
prince @entity13 and @entity4 's child would move into third place , become more important than @entity7 and not be subject to the centuries - old law of primogeniture , which puts male heirs ahead of women			1
he or she will leapfrog @entity7 by being be the first born of first - in - line prince @entity22 's first son			1
the baby will become monarch , regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl it is anticipated that @entity7 and @entity32 could be asked to be the child 's godparents , if the royal couple follow the tradition appointing the best man and maid of honour from their wedding			1
the baby will be third in line to the throne regardless of gender after prime minister @entity45 agreed a deal with other @entity48 countries to change the rules on the royal line of succession which means male heirs will no longer be given priority			1
this means that in the 15 other countries where the @entity56 is head of state the rules must be changed			1
it had been feared there could be a constitutional crisis if the royal couple had a baby girl before the law was changed			1
but today 's announcement that the @entity4 is expecting the couple 's first child - third in line to the throne - has come after the deal was agreed			2
in october 2011 , @entity45 announced that the 16 @entity48 countries where the @entity56 is head of state had agreed to give female royals the same rights of succession as their brothers			1
' put simply , if the @entity3 and @entity4 were to have a little girl , that girl would one day be our queen , ” mr @entity45 said			0
under the ancient rules of male primogeniture , first born royal daughters in direct line to the throne were leapfrogged by their younger male siblings			1
the principle was criticised and widely viewed as outdated and discriminatory			0
the current law of male primogeniture only allows @entity56 to be queen because she did not have any brothers			2
moves towards constitutional change gathered pace in the wake of the @entity3 and @entity4 ’s wedding in april 2011 in anticipation they would produce an offspring			0
mr @entity45 had previously warned it would take time due to on - going negotiations with the @entity48 countries where the @entity56 is also head of state , but at the @entity98 in october 2011 he confirmed the changes would go ahead			1
@entity100 said any attempt to alter the law would be a ' difficult and complex matter ' , with parallel legislation needed in all such @entity48 nations			1
it will also involve amendments to some of @entity110 ’s key constitutional documents , such as the @entity111 of 1688 , the 1701 @entity112 and the 1706 @entity113 with @entity114			0
proposed legislation will refer to the descendants of the current @entity117 , meaning that @entity13 ’s first child would follow him in the line of succession , whether a girl or a boy			2
however , the current generation of royals will not be affected			0
it will not be retrospective - meaning the princess royal will not jump ahead of her younger brothers the @entity3 and the @entity129			0
ministers have made clear the changes will apply from october 28 , 2011 – the date of the @entity48 summit where the countries agreed the plans			1
so close : @entity136 of @entity6 , ( centre ) , prince @entity13 ( right ) and @entity7 ( left ) wave as they pass the @entity140 during the @entity141 in june the change needs to be legislated for in the @entity48 nations of the @entity110 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 , the @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 , @entity156 , the @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and the @entity160 and @entity161			1
but this is regarded as assured			0
deputy prime minister @entity163 told the @entity164 in may : ' if the birds and bees were to deliver that blessing to the @entity3 and @entity4 , and indeed the nation , then that little girl would be covered by the provisions of these changes of the rules of succession because they operate from the time of the declaration of the @entity48 summit last october			1
' it is very important to remember that the rules are de facto in place , even though they have yet to be implemented through legislation in the way that i have described			1
' the changes mean that , for all descendants of the @entity117 , younger sons will no longer take precedence over an elder daughter in the line of succession			2
members of the @entity193 who marry a @entity194 will also in future be able to succeed to the @entity195			0
and an ancient and unused rule saying descendants of @entity198 are supposed to gain the consent of the monarch to marry will only apply to the first six people in the line of succession			2
the law was brought in following the @entity204 – when a @entity206 invasion helped overthrow a @entity208 king – so that a @entity194 could never sit on our throne again			2
it also means that the princess royal , the @entity56 ’s second born , is just tenth in line to the throne behind her younger brothers @entity217 ( fourth ) and @entity218 ( seventh )			2
the 15 other countries where @entity56 is queen are @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity151 , the @entity150 , @entity152 , @entity161 , the @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity156 , @entity159 and the @entity160 , @entity153 , @entity148 and @entity149 , and @entity154 and @entity155			2
@entity56 , who celebrated 60 years on the throne this year , was only able to become queen because she did not have any brothers the @entity48 leaders also agreed to overturn the @entity225 , which means that only the @entity227 heirs of the @entity228 , granddaughter of @entity229 , can become king or queen			1
the @entity56 hailed the deal on changing the rules as the 53 @entity48 countries met last year , saying she wanted the theme of allowing women to play a full part to last for years			1
she said : ' the theme this year is women @entity238			0
' it reminds us of the potential in our societies that is yet to be fully unlocked and it encourages us to find ways to allow all girls and women to play their full part			0
' we must continue to strive in our own countries and across the @entity48 together to promote that theme in a lasting way beyond this year			1
' her comments were taken as a sign that the @entity56 approves of the reform			0
the @entity48 is a looser group of 53 countries , of which the @entity56 is the head			1
happy : princess @entity255 , who presented @entity256 to soldiers from @entity258 at @entity259 in @entity259 today , is currently 10th in line - but would become 11th mr @entity45 had criticised the existing rules as ’ out - dated ’ and in need of change			2
it was also agreed that the barrier to the heir to the throne marrying a @entity194 will also be removed , but that it would not affect the position of the @entity269 as the established @entity269			0
the @entity56 and future monarchs will be @entity271 and @entity272 of the @entity273 ancient rule meaning that all descendants of @entity198 are supposed to require the consent of the monarch before they can marry will also be abolished			0
the @entity110 government must now introduce legislation to change the @entity225 , the @entity280 , the @entity281 and the @entity282			0
the new rules on the line of succession were agreed by @entity45 gestures at the @entity98 in @entity144 last year but because the rule will be backdated and it will be many years before a female heir will be close to the throne , the government says the change is n't urgent			1
government sources have stressed that the new rule will apply only to heirs born after october 2011.princess @entity255 , the princess royal , would still be placed below her two younger brothers , the @entity3 and the @entity129			0
had the rule been in force before , @entity110 history would have been very different			0
constitutional experts say that in 1509 @entity299 would have taken the throne instead of @entity301 , and as a result @entity302 would never have been @entity56			0
it would also have meant @entity56 @entity305 would have been succeeded by her daughter , princess @entity305 , the princess royal , in 1901 , and not @entity306 when she died just a few months later , her son @entity307 would have ascended the throne – something which could have prevented the @entity310			0
it is said the @entity56 now would have been the completely unknown princess @entity312			0
most @entity314 monarchies have already established an equal law of succession - it is in force in @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 , the @entity206 and @entity323			2
now only @entity324 , @entity325 and @entity326 are left with the old system .			0

@entity48 countries have agreed changes to line of succession rules
the law of primogeniture had once meant boys leapfrogged older sisters
new baby would be in third place by becoming more important than @entity7
speculation that @entity7 and @entity32 could become godparents
