@entity1 's capture of a @entity3 powerbase will spark a fresh wave of upheaval at the beleaguered club			1
the sports direct billionaire secured virtual control of @entity10 affairs on saturday after his offer of a £ 2million upfront loan was accepted by the board to stave off imminent financial peril			1
@entity1 ’s plan , which it was claimed includes the option of a new share issue , beat off opposition offers of aid from @entity21 and @entity22 and was driven through by an alliance of @entity24 and @entity26 partners			1
@entity1 has strengthened his grip on the @entity3 boardroom after his £ 2million offer now @entity1 can flex his muscles and @entity31 , currently on holiday in @entity33 with his family , will be announced as the first major victim of that show of strength on monday when he leaves the chief executive role he has filled since november last year			1
former @entity42 managing director @entity41 is in pole position for a top post within @entity1 ’s reshuffle and , on saturday night , the name of @entity1 ’s business associate @entity40 was also credited with being in the frame for a place in a new - look boardroom			2
@entity1 has had his sights trained on @entity31 since early september in the wake of the announcement that £ 3.1m had been raised from a share issue as @entity31 and finance director @entity53 blocked his attempts to use assets — including the club crest and the @entity3 trademark — as security during talks over a loan in the region of £ 10m			1
in removing both financial executives , who were open to the @entity21 / @entity65 investment plan , @entity1 can use the acceptance of his funding offer as the lever to cement control over the @entity3 brand and plant his own men at the controls			1
although @entity31 had no intention of resigning , his colleague @entity53 walked out on friday , with @entity21 musing that the former @entity76 and @entity77 financial executive had quit ‘ as a matter of principle against something that is going on ’			0
@entity53 departed because he felt the @entity3 vote on which offer to accept was going to go against his financial logic			2
it ’s understood that @entity53 could have stayed on by reverting to his previous role as financial director without a seat on the board			0
however , he felt that further @entity1 involvement was not going to be healthy for the club			0
the £ 16m @entity21 bailout was killed off after key shareholder @entity91 rejected the package in company with @entity1 and @entity26			2
and @entity96 owner @entity22 ’s late intervention to oppose @entity1 with an alternative loan option also failed			1
@entity98 holds proxy over 26 per cent , including the mysterious @entity100 and @entity101 , and refused to back @entity21 ’s proposal			0
throw in @entity1 ’s 8.9 per cent and largest shareholder @entity26 ’s 16.3 per cent and that cabal enjoys 51 - per - cent control			0
@entity1 ’s sports direct stores also have hold over @entity3 retail			2
it was claimed in quarters on saturday that the @entity10 side were 48 hours from administration			0
however , there were three funding options to select from to rule out that extreme measure and it ’s understood that one of @entity53 ’s last acts in his role was to sign off the october payroll so there was no danger of @entity10 staff going without their monthly wage			0
the @entity3 board rejected @entity96 owner @entity22 's 11th - hour loan offer however , the @entity1 loan will only guarantee solvency into the @entity130 , when fresh investment or creative work on retail contracts with the @entity42 owner could create extra funds			1
furthermore , the club must then construct a credible case for the accounts to june 2014 being signed off by auditors @entity140 as a going concern in advance of an @entity143 before the end of this year			0
it would be no surprise if , further down the line , speculation mounted about the future of @entity150			0
the @entity3 legend is known not to be favoured by influential members of the hierarchy and the removal of two men with whom he enjoyed a mutually - respectful relationship is not a positive for the manager			0
although no official statement was forthcoming from the rival parties to @entity1 on saturday night , there was grave concern and fury among those ranks and of fearful supporters who , more than two years ago , watched as administrators appointed by @entity167 handed over the assets of @entity3 to @entity169 for £ 5.5m			1
those close to the opposition camps — the @entity21 / @entity172 alliance and @entity22 — fear that @entity1 has effectively seized control of the soul and direction of @entity3 for as little as £ 2m			1
some believe it ’s inconceivable that the @entity178 can accept the @entity1 deal when other , credible , fully - funded alternatives are on the table , such as the £ 3m @entity22 loan or the package of £ 16m put forward by @entity21 , @entity65 and @entity184 , split between equity and immediate loans , to ease the club through the current crisis			1
supporters ’ group the @entity189 urged the @entity178 to intervene earlier this month to see off @entity1 ’s power grab			0
however , the @entity178 plan only to write to @entity3 seeking clarification regarding suggestions his loan has been accepted with boardroom appointment caveats			2
@entity1 signed an undertaking with the @entity178 that he would not own more than 10 per cent of @entity3 shares and that he would not exert control and influence over the day - to - day running of the club			1
however , that was drafted in the post-liquidation days , designed to protect against a block shareholding influence and framed around being in the best interests of the club			0
any bid by the @entity178 to intervene could lead to legal steps and @entity3 could then argue that it is @entity1 ’s influence that is now in those best interests because , without his funding , they would once again be in dire financial straits .			2

@entity1 *tightens* his grip on @entity3 boardroom with £ 2m upfront loan
@entity96 owner @entity22 saw his offer rejected
undertaking with @entity221 @entity220 means @entity1 can not own more than 10 *%*
