@entity0 sold £ 6billion gold and foreign currency to protect the rouble wholesale gas prices rose the most in two years yesterday as markets reacted to the crisis in @entity7			1
fears that supplies to western @entity10 could be affected saw the price surge by 10 per cent at one point			1
the cost of crude oil also rose – driven by fears that @entity16 , which is a major producer , might be hit by trade sanctions			1
the turmoil spilled over into stockmarkets , with big falls in share prices in @entity23 and @entity24			0
@entity42 , an adviser to the @entity35 who is often used by the authorities to stake out a hardline stance but does not make policy , added that if @entity47 froze the accounts of @entity16 businesses and individuals , @entity0 would recommend that all holders of @entity36 treasuries sell them			1
the statement comes as the @entity36 @entity55 admitted it is preparing legislation to provide support to @entity7 , and consulting the @entity59 administration on possible sanctions against individual @entity16 - ranging from visa bans and asset freezes to suspending military cooperation and sales , as well as economic sanctions			1
@entity0 has been forced to sell off gold and foreign currency worth £ 6billion to try to protect the sliding value of the rouble			1
the threat from @entity71 that @entity16 could sell all its @entity72 , drop the dollar as a reserve currency and default on loans from the @entity36 is an idle one according to analyst @entity77 at @entity78			1
‘ it would be a declaration of economic war - and it would hurt @entity16 a lot more than the @entity36			1
' @entity16 ’s main exports are oil and gas , which are traded in dollars and which means @entity16 receives constant huge inflows of dollars			1
‘ @entity16 would have to find a buyer for what is probably in the region of $ 100billion in @entity72 , which , if not impossible , would in any case mean they would get a terrible deal			2
by defaulting on loans their access to funding globally would be cut off			0
‘ in the unlikely hypothetical event the threat was carried through , the main impact would be upward pressure on long - term @entity36 interest rates – but it is likely that the @entity103 could take steps to counter that			2
there would be passing disruption for the @entity36 and world markets but lasting damage to @entity16 itself			1
’ @entity16 ’s central bank raised its key interest rate from 5.5 per cent to 7 per cent to try to stop investors taking their money out of the country			2
the £ 34billion tumble in the value of shares on the biggest @entity16 stock exchange , the @entity120 , was greater than the cost of hosting and running the @entity122 last month			1
@entity123 , @entity16 ’s deputy economy minister , described the reaction of the financial markets as ‘ hysteria ’ , which would subside in the coming days			2
meanwhile , @entity0 seemed to be initiating economic sanctions against the @entity7 , with @entity16 's top gas producer @entity128 announcing it will remove a discount on gas prices for @entity7 from april motorists were warned of potential fuel price rises as speculators bought up stocks to capitalise on the political uncertainty			1
an @entity137 spokesman said : ‘ fuel traders have already begun to buy up stocks to guard against being caught out in the event of the situation worsening , which automatically causes prices to increase due to a tightening in supply			0
‘ and , to make matters worse , the price of oil will almost certainly be negatively affected , further increasing fuel costs and , in turn , forecourt prices			2
’ @entity160 , a spokesman for the @entity161 , said : ‘ experience from previous crises shows that commodity market speculation tends to be a greater problem than the actual threat to supply			0
over recent weeks , reduced oil flow from @entity153 has put upward pressure on the price of oil yet it has had little impact on the @entity157 pump price			0
this is primarily due to the strength of the pound			0
menacing @entity170 activists take to the streets in @entity172 yesterday , many of whom were waving weapons ‘ the average price of petrol is 10p a litre lower than a year ago , when it peaked at 140p a litre			0
now it is still below 130p			0
the $ 2 - a - barrel rise in today ’s @entity182 oil price represents a possible 1p rise in the pump price of petrol , but only if sustained			2
’ gas from @entity16 , some of which is exported through pipelines that run across @entity7 , makes up around 25 per cent of supplies to the @entity190 ’s homes and businesses			1
masked and wielding makeshift weapons , a crowd of around 3,000 pro-russian activists led a demonstration in the @entity7 port of @entity200 of the group managed to break into a session of the local parliament , smashing windows and injuring an official , according to local @entity206 outside the building , activists in balaclavas and helmets , waved @entity16 flags and wooden clubs with screws in and chanted ‘ referendum ’			2
police had to move in to after dozens of young people from the far - right @entity215 arrived on the scene demanding that the @entity170 demonstrators leave and remove a @entity16 flag that had been placed on the @entity219 the eastern city of @entity221 , around 100 pro-russian protesters seized two floors of a regional government building after the self - imposed @entity225 government appointed a local oligarch as a regional governor			2
it is feared that @entity0 will use its control over the supply as economic leverage to head off opposition to its decision to send troops in to @entity235			0
it supplies gas to @entity7 at a deep discount – a concession it warns will end in april			2
this could affect supplies to other countries if @entity7 decides to grab gas from the @entity16 pipelines crossing its territory			1
it used this tactic during a dispute in 2009 and prices rose sharply			0
@entity16 does not supply gas directly to the @entity157 , however any increase in international wholesale prices will feed through to customers here			2
analysts point out that @entity10 is less reliant on @entity16 gas than before			1
the unusually mild winter means that the @entity157 has 25 per cent more in storage than normal			0
at the same time , @entity259 nations have spent billions on wind power with the result that many gas - fired power stations have been mothballed			0
and strong westerly winds have allowed @entity157 windfarms to consistently produce more than 10 per cent of the country ’s electricity in recent weeks			0
the wholesale cost of gas had been falling for three weeks and – despite the @entity7 crisis – it is still below the level of february 2012			1
@entity273 , an energy trader at @entity275 , said : ‘ gas prices remain volatile and are closely linked to the power price – further price rises may be seen			0
‘ the situation could be worse but , with @entity10 having had a mild winter , prices have fallen significantly of late			0
however , this morning ’s rise has eradicated three weeks of constant falls			0
riot police outside the government building targeted by the protesters in @entity172 ‘ should this continue , prices are likely to carry on rising in the medium term			0
’ @entity157 gas prices rose as high as 61.95p a therm – up 9.4 per cent – at one stage before falling back to around 60p a therm			0
the events in @entity16 will be watched with particular concern by the @entity157 energy giant @entity295			0
last year it ended a troubled partnership with @entity16 oligarchs and decided to get into bed with the @entity16 state - owned oil giant @entity299 , where it owns 20 per cent of the shares			1
sanctions imposed against @entity16 could directly impact @entity295 and its desire to be the partner of the @entity35 in exploiting oil and gas reserves in @entity308 and the @entity309 .			1

fears supplies to western @entity10 could be affected by crisis in @entity7
price of gas surged by 10 per cent at one point yesterday
crude oil cost also up - driven by fears @entity16 might be hit with sanctions
@entity35 aide suggests @entity16 may refuse to pay loans if @entity36 issues sanctions
@entity42 said @entity0 might also drop the dollar as reserve currency
@entity0 sold £ 6billion gold and foreign currency to protect the rouble
