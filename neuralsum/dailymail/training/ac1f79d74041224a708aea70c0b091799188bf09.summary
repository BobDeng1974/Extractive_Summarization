@entity0 has been telling @entity2 's players to think of beating @entity3 while they are in bed			1
@entity2 will make it eight wins from 10 matches on thursday if they beat @entity3 at the @entity8			1
the idea of travelling to @entity10 for a lunch - time kick - off on @entity12 may not appeal to many people - particularly those who enjoyed a heavy night seeing in the new year			0
@entity2 manager @entity0 wants his players to ' dream ' before @entity3 clash @entity17 has flourished in a number of roles under the @entity20 since his arrival but @entity22 is relishing the opportunity of gaining ground on @entity25 and @entity26 , who play @entity28 and @entity29 respectively later in the day			1
the @entity20 took little notice of @entity26 and @entity3 's slip - ups last weekend - @entity2 themselves failed to take advantage as they drew at @entity29 - and the @entity20 insists only his players will decide whether they become genuine title contenders in the coming weeks			1
' you have to always do it by yourself and not depend on results of the opponent , ' the @entity2 manager said			1
' you have to be busy with yourself , with your preparation , and the imagination of the game			0
' all the players have to do that - dream of the game already , you have to play the game already in your bed			1
' @entity22 takes his @entity2 side to the @entity8 to face @entity3 on @entity12 although @entity2 sit in third position after a nine - match unbeaten run , @entity22 is yet to see a completely satisfactory performance from his team			1
the 3 - 1 win @entity55 win over @entity56 had the hallmarks of a victory from the sir @entity60 era , but @entity22 was still not totally happy			2
@entity22 is so demanding that he says he has enjoyed just a single ' perfect ' performance from one of his teams during his 27 - year career			2
and that came 20 years ago when he coached an @entity67 team containing the likes of @entity69 , @entity70 and a 19 - year - old @entity71 to a 2 - 0 @entity73 win at @entity74			0
' that was a perfect game - the only one in my eyes , ' @entity22 said			1
@entity78 ( battling with @entity79 ) has found himself in among the goals again ' i have not achieved that with @entity2			2
' the fact that @entity2 dropped points at @entity29 thanks to @entity79 ' brilliance , and at @entity86 , where the hosts played the final 25 minutes with 10 men , still rankles with @entity22			1
' in the last three games - @entity92 , @entity56 , @entity29 - we should have had nine points , ' the former @entity90 manager said			0
' then , we would ( have ) four more points and we would be only six points ( behind @entity26 )			0
' reflecting on his first five months in @entity96 , @entity22 said he had been taken aback by the support he had received from @entity2 fans despite the club 's stuttering start			1
' i have never had the experience that when you lose or draw at home that the fans still applaud you , showing their belief in you			0
never , ' @entity22 said			2
' in @entity90 , ( they wave ) white handkerchiefs			0
in @entity109 , they whistle			0
in @entity111 , @entity67 , they are shouting for someone else			0
@entity2 are also beginning to see the best of @entity115 striker @entity114 ' here , they stand up , and applaud			2
that 's why i 'm thanking the fans because they were very important in my first six months			0
' @entity120 and @entity121 could return from illness and injury respectively for the @entity3 match and @entity125 may feature after @entity22 played down the seriousness of a pelvic injury			1
' he 's coming back			0
it 's not serious , ' @entity22 said			2
@entity26 's @entity129 was subjected to a rash challenge by @entity131 when the @entity132 went to @entity3 last week , but @entity22 is sure the officials will not let thursday 's match turn ugly			1
the @entity2 manager added : ' i think the referee is the most important man on the pitch always in relation to tackles			0
' he has to allow it or not			0
we have @entity143 and i think he is a very good referee			0
' @entity22 moved to praise referee @entity143 , who will take charge of the game at @entity3			1

@entity2 face @entity3 at the @entity8 on thursday
@entity0 is aiming to make it eight wins from 10 matches
@entity2 boss says his players must ' dream'of beating @entity3
@entity22 wants his players to ' already play the game in bed '
