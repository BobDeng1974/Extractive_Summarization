in 2009 , after four tours of @entity163 , @entity43 retired			0
he had not only shot more of the enemy than any other @entity11 sniper but had also gained a chestful of medals , including three @entity192 for gallantry			0
in february 2013 , the sniper was shot dead , alongside a friend , by a soldier they were trying to help who was apparently suffering from severe post-traumatic stress			0
despite @entity1 's condemning tweet , he went on to describe @entity133 as a ' great filmmaker ' on his @entity203 page , saying that his movie ' @entity205 ' is his favorite @entity206 of all time			1
however , he later wrote : ' but something started to go haywire with @entity133 in the last decade			1

@entity244 , managing director of ' @entity245 ' and an ex- @entity247 officer and @entity249 helicopter pilot , said the campaign does not aim to show veterans in a good light - but in an honest one			1
' most @entity11 tell us that they only see veterans portrayed as broken or as heroes who walk on water in film and television , ' he told the @entity261 via phone			1
' we 're missing something in the middle			0
they 're your next door neighbor who helps you bring your garbage cans back when they blow away			0

' launched in 2012 , the ' @entity245 ' group aimed to enlist @entity52 to help discourage stereotypes and promote more accurate portrayals of the 2.6million soldiers coming home over the past decade			1
surveys have found that many @entity11 presume veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder , are homeless or are addicted to drugs or alcohol			0

we 're challenging the entertainment industry â€” myself included - to live up to the responsibilities inherent in the powers we have and with the reach that we have , ' said @entity313 , a producer and creator of the ' 6 @entity13 ' program			1
@entity313 said films like 1987 's ' @entity329 ' by @entity330 and @entity133 's new ' @entity5 ' would likely be eligible for certification because they portray veterans accurately , even if the soldiers in those films are n't representative of the population of veterans			1
mrs. @entity0 cited tv shows including ' @entity339 ' and ' @entity340 ' as ones that share stories of ' our veterans in new and meaningful ways			1
' during the high - profile event , she said telling veterans ' stories honestly makes for ' tremendous tv and movies ' and ' are good for business as well			2

' in all of them , being a veteran was not their defining characteristic			0
' we have a real opportunity to go way beyond the platitudes of the entertainment industry , ' he said			0
' we love to say , " i support the troops ! " and " i 've got a yellow ribbon ! " but there 's an actual , tangible way to make a difference			0
that 's what the challenge is here			0
