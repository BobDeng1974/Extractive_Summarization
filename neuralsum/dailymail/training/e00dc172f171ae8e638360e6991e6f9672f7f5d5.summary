humans have marvelled at the majesty of @entity2 for thousands of years , but the famous landmark ’s original purpose has remained a mystery			1
now , a new technique has revealed 15 previously unknown @entity8 monuments around the mysterious monument in @entity10			1
and one archaeologist thinks they could provide evidence that the stone circle was at the heart of a busy heathen processional route over 4,000 years ago			0
the team has conducted the first detailed underground survey of the area surrounding @entity2 , covering around four square miles ( 6km ) , journalist @entity29 reported for @entity33			1
they discovered evidence of 15 unknown and poorly - understood late @entity8 monuments , including other henges , barrows , pits and ditches , which could all harbour valuable information about the prehistoric site			1
in the summer of 2009 , geophysicists used magnetic sensors and ground - penetrating radar to scan the area around @entity2 , detecting unknown structures			1
the sensors let experts detect evidence of ancient digging and buildings by mapping variations in the @entity55 ’s magnetic field			2
historians are not sure what purpose the @entity57 served and professor @entity22 describes it as a ' bloody great barrier to the north of @entity2 ' ‘ this is among the most important landscapes , and probably the most studied landscape , in the world , ’ professor @entity22 told the magazine			1
‘ and the area has been absolutely transformed by this survey			0
it wo n’t be the same again			0
’ professor @entity22 believes these sites suggest @entity2 was not an isolated monument in an unspoilt landscape , but that there was lots of human activity nearby			1
as long ago as 1620 , diggers discovered cattle skulls and burnt coals buried in the centre of the stone circle and around 60 years ago , carbon dating of a piece of charcoal in a pit led scientists to believe that @entity2 was erected in @entity84			0
in 2003 , @entity85 of @entity86 claimed that the workers who built @entity2 lived in a nearby settlement of @entity89 , after unearthing evidence of huts , tools , and animal bones			1
he also said that the stone circle was a cemetery , as well as a religious monument			0
no - one is exactly sure why – and how - @entity2 was built			2
experts have suggested it was a temple , parliament and a graveyard			0
some people think the stones have healing powers , while others think they have musical properties when struck with a stone			0
they could have acted as a giant musical instrument to call ancient people to the monument			0
what is clear , is that the stones were aligned with phases of the sun. people were buried there and skeletal evidence shows that people travelled hundreds of miles to visit @entity2 – for whatever reason			2
now , experts think that the route was a busy one and that @entity2 could be viewed differently from different positions			2
it seems that instead of being a complete barrier , the @entity123 acted as a gateway to guide visitors to the stone circle			1
in the latest study , which took 120 days spread over four years , the experts created a new map of the @entity2 landscape			1
they included what we think of as @entity2 , as well as a long strip of land called the @entity123 , which ran east to west for around two miles ( 3km )			1
it is thought the ditch barrier predates the stone circle by several hundred years			0
the @entity123 barrows – mass graves – to the south of the @entity142 were marked as well as the 15 new finds			0
it is hoped their contents will become clear with future excavation			0
historians are not sure what purpose the @entity57 served and professor @entity22 as a ‘ bloody great barrier to the north of @entity2			2
’ some experts think it was linked to the passage of the sun and this was supported by new clues			2
the team discovered gaps in the ditch including a large break in the northern side to allow people to enter and exit the @entity142			0
professor @entity22 thinks the gaps served as ‘ channels though the landscape ’ to enable people to move north and south			2
he also found a huge pit at the eastern end of the @entity123 , which is today 3ft ( 1metre ) underground			1
no - one is exactly sure why - and how - @entity2 was built			0
experts have suggested it was a temple , parliament and a graveyard because it was large – 14.7ft ( 4.5metres ) in diameter – the team thinks it was used for rituals as a ‘ marker of some kind ’			1
it is also located on the path of the sunrise on the summer solstice			0
‘ we thought , that ’s a bit of a coincidence ! ’ professor @entity22 said			0
‘ that was the point at which we thought , what ’s at the other end ? and there ’s another pit			0
‘ two pits , marking the midsummer sunrise and the midsummer solstice , set within a monument that ’s meant to be something to do with the passage of the sun. ’ professor @entity22 told mr @entity198 that on the longest day of the year , the pits form a triangle with @entity2 , marking sunrise and sunset			1
he thinks they may have had fires burning in them and that the site was designed to be seen in the day and night , especially at sunrise and sunset			0
‘ increasingly we can see the area around @entity2 as providing extensive evidence for complex liturgical movement - which we can now understand , largely because we know where things are , ’ he said			2
he also believes the building of @entity2 was a ‘ monumentalising ’ of a procession			1
@entity2 is a prehistoric stone circle monument , cemetery , and archaeological site located on @entity218 , about 8 miles ( 13 km ) north of @entity218 , @entity10 , @entity219			1

@entity2 project used magnetic sensors to scan landmark in @entity10
experts found 15 previously unknown @entity8 monuments underground
sites suggest that @entity2 was not an isolated monument in an unspoilt landscape , but that there was lots of human activity nearby
study revealed a large gap in the @entity238 barrier , indicating it acted as a gateway for ' worshipers ' as well as a marker for the passage of the sun
@entity238 is a strip of land which ran east to west for around two miles ( 3km )
two pits at either end of the @entity123 could have been used for ritual fires
expert thinks @entity2 was built to ‘ monumentalise ’ a procession
