on a blustery night in @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 secured automatic progress to the final by finishing second in their heats			1
teenager @entity12 equalled her personal best of 11.21 seconds as she finished behind overwhelming @entity19 favourite @entity18 , who she will again line - up alongside in the final later this evening			1
personal best : @entity1 ( c ) finished a close second behind favourite @entity18 ( @entity25 ) ' i ca n't believe it , ' the 18 - year - old told the @entity29			1
' i just had a relaxed approach and i was determined to enjoy it			0
' @entity18 , we 're virtually training partners and she 's always encouraging me			1
i 'll get ready for the final now , i ca n't wait			2
' however , @entity36 hopes of a three - pronged attack in the final were dashed as @entity39 missed out by the smallest of margins			1
the 23 - year - old , former champion @entity41 and @entity43 were all tied on 11.24 secs , with the latter taking the fastest loser spot when it went to thousandths of a second			0
' i 'm extremely disappointed , ' @entity39 said			0
' i do n't know how i did n't get myself into a @entity49 final			2
' after the @entity51 and @entity52 where i 've come out and done that , there are not many words that can describe how i 'm feeling			0
i 'm disappointed and feel like i 've failed			0
' flying the flag : @entity3 also finished second in her semi-final to set up a gold winning opportunity there was to be no shock exit in the 400 metres semi-finals as world champion @entity62 booked an automatic place for friday 's final , finishing just 0.02 seconds ahead of @entity65 's @entity64 in her heat			1
@entity2 will be without a representative in the men 's 400 metres hurdles later that night , though , as national champion @entity70 , @entity72 and @entity73 all failed to make it through the semi-finals			1
the latter 's season 's best of 49.47s was not enough , while @entity80 's @entity79 also missed out			2

@entity90 crossed the line in 45.40 in the next , before exciting prospect @entity92 went quicker still in reaching the final			2
close call @entity5 missed out on a final place by less than a hundreth of a second the 19 - year - old was the fastest of the qualifiers , winning in 45.30 to put him in with a good chance of adding to the 4x400m gold he won at @entity104			1
' i got out this time which i 'm actually quite proud of because i was a bit nervous , ' @entity92 told the @entity29			0
' this is all new to me , a real experience and i 'm learning from it			0
' i 've done exactly what i want to do so far			0
to get three of us in the final is great			0
a @entity36 one - two - three would be the dream but it 's one step at a time			0
