other @entity1 states and territories may follow @entity4 's tough - cop lead in dealing with problem motorcycle gangs , after its controversial anti-bikie laws were upheld in the @entity7 on friday			1
the @entity7 has rejected a challenge , brought by @entity10 member @entity9 , to the new @entity11 ( @entity12 ) laws introduced by the @entity4 government in october last year			1
the vlad laws , brought in following a public bikie brawl in a @entity18 restaurant last year , declared 26 gangs criminal organisations and banned their members from wearing club logos and gathering in public			1
the @entity24 has rejected a challenge to @entity4 's tough anti-bikie laws which ban outlaw motorcycle clubs from wearing club patches and gathering in public spaces the @entity30 ( @entity31 ) , on behalf of 17 @entity4 clubs , had funded the @entity7 challenge in an attempt to overturn the laws , which it claims are unconstitutional			1
but the @entity7 found the laws are not unconstitutional and said mr @entity9 lacked standing to pursue the challenge because he had never been charged under the legislation			1
in doing so , it has opened the way for other states to look at hardening their approach to outlaw gangs			0
' we 'd be crazy not to take advantage of that and make some modifications to our laws , ' said @entity1 attorney - general @entity49 , who wants to see the power to declare criminal organisations in the hands of the parliament as it is in @entity4			2
attorney - general of @entity55 , @entity56 , said friday 's ruling was encouraging			0

@entity65 attorney - general @entity64 said his government was also attracted to a number of elements in the @entity4 laws			2
similar laws banning convicted criminals and criminal organisations from meeting in @entity73 are already in place			0
following the @entity7 ruling , @entity75 told reporters in @entity78 : ' it would be good to see everyone work together to make @entity55 a far safer place			0
' @entity30 spokesman @entity82 said he was disappointed the judges focused on whether mr @entity9 was entitled to challenge the laws			2
' the laws still have n't been made valid by the @entity7 , ' he told reporters .			0
