he said : ' she persuaded two of her elderly clients to loan her £ 290,000 in several tranches over two years			1
' by 2010 , at the latest , her finances were such that she must have known there was a serious risk she could not repay the loans and therefore her actions were dishonest			0
' she has now been declared bankrupt and it appears that her old clients will never recover the vast majority of what they lent her			0
