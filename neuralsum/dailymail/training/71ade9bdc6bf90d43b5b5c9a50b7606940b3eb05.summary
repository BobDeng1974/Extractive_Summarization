cover girl @entity1 , an occasional host unlike core presenters @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , has kept her saturday shift despite the considerable upset			2
however , @entity1 ’s long - term @entity2 prospects look bleak after @entity19 broke the news yesterday of disquiet at @entity22 over the 30 - year - old 's raunchy shoot			1
fur enough : @entity2 presenter @entity1 poses for a lingerie shoot in 2004			1
the tv host began working for @entity2 in 2010 picture perfect : @entity1 , described in 2004 for these pictures as model , actress and presenter , in a lingerie shoot styled by @entity33 more pictures emerged this morning of @entity1 's modelling past from 2004			1
described then as a lingerie model , the shoot took place several years before @entity39 - born @entity1 began working for the tv network in 2010			1
the @entity8 pictures of the glamorous @entity1 in her underwear has especially upset a number of her female colleagues , who feel such exposure can only damage their efforts to be taken seriously as broadcast journalists and become known for the quality of their work rather than their @entity53 down to watch video of @entity1 's @entity8 shoot ... right @entity1 : @entity2 presenter @entity1 poses in a saucy photoshoot for @entity8 ( above and below ) , she featured as the cover star ( below , right ) of this month 's issue and @entity1 will not have helped her career prospects either with her disparaging take on @entity2 ’s biggest production of the year : ‘ on transfer deadline day , if it ’s quiet , we ’ll mess about passing blank pieces of paper pretending they ’re breaking news stories			1
’ @entity2 top brass are also angered that @entity1 ’s photo spread comes at a time when the station are giving more prominence to the achievements of women in sport			1
serious business : @entity2 presenters @entity13 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) model behaviour : @entity2 presenter @entity82 poses for a glamour shoot in 2008 @entity84 girl : @entity2 presenter @entity15 launches @entity86 on @entity87 in april 2004 ( left ) and models for @entity90 catalogue ( right ) also in 2004 video : watch @entity1 's @entity8 shoot ... @entity1 ( right , presenting @entity2 ) has laughed off her glamour girl image , insisting she 's just a down - to - earth @entity39 lass with a love of the beautiful game			1
the 30 - year - old 's tv career has taken her around the world with stints at @entity102 , presenting @entity104 football for @entity105 and @entity2			1
it was all a world away from @entity108 where @entity109 fan @entity1 got her first taste of football			2
she told the @entity112 website : ' i used to go with my dad all the time as he had a season ticket			0
and then at half - time i used to sit drinking @entity119 and eating fish - and - chips crisps , they ’re some of my first memories of watching the football , it was always the @entity122 treat			2
' @entity1 says she has not changed despite all the attention			2
' i ’m not your typical girl in that sense , ' she admits			0
' i ’ve never really thought i had looks or whatever , and i do n’t see myself like that at all			0
i see myself as just a down - to - earth northern girl that ’s doing alright			0
' @entity1 has used her profile to highlight the problems of childhood abuse after revealing she was abused as a teenage athlete			2
she told the @entity139 : ' i went through a phase of cutting myself			0
i ’ve still got scars on my wrist			0
i thought i was worthless			0
you believe what is wrong is your fault			0
' but i ’ve learned survival is the most powerful thing ever			0
i want to show people you can come from anything and make something of yourself even if you are an abuse survivor			0
