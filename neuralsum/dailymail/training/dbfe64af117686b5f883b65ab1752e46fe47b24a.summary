by @entity0 this is the moment a man attempted an ' incredibly stupid ' 20ft tombstone into shallow water while sitting in a kayak			1
police and the @entity7 have today reacted with dismay at the images of the person tombstoning 20ft off a groyne at @entity12 as horrified holidaymakers watch on			1
cheered on by friends , he perched in the kayak and launched himself 20ft into the shallow water below			1
police and rescue services labelled this stunt at @entity19 as ' extremely dangerous ' and ' stupid ' a @entity21 spokesman said it was an ' incredibly stupid thing to do - he could have been killed or ended up in a wheelchair for the rest of his life '			1
the spokesman added : ' usually it is kids jumping into the sea - this is a dangerous new development if people are going to launch themselves in kayaks			2
' since 2005 there have been 20 deaths and 76 serious injuries caused by tombstoning in the @entity36 , according to coastguard figures			2
a spokesman for the @entity7 warned it was ' extremely dangerous ' to jump into shallow water			2
' you can strike your head on the seabed or hit rocks which are not always visible			0
' the craze involves jumping from cliffs , piers and other structures , before entering the water below in an upright position ' like a tombstone '			0
emergency services have continually warned of the dangers of the craze but there continues to be fatalities every year			0
last week a young man was caught on camera attempting a 60ft leap from @entity60 , which spans the @entity61 between @entity62 and @entity63 , @entity64			1
the police warning about the dangers involved in tombstoning comes just as holiday swimming spots such as the extremely popular @entity12 ( pictured ) begin to fill up in the middle of @entity36 's hot summer last week police along the coast in @entity74 warned there could be a tragedy just yards from where doctor who star @entity77 and a tv crew are shooting a new series of the nail - biter tv show @entity80			1
daredevil youngsters have been tombstoning and making macho leaps up to 30ft into the sea from the pier at @entity85 , narrowly missing boats coming in and out of @entity87			0
@entity77 , along with @entity89 winner @entity88 and the rest of the cast , are in the @entity74 holiday resort where shooting has started on a follow - up to last year â€™s crime drama			1
with the school summer break about to start , thousands of holidaying families will flock to @entity85 hoping to spot a celebrity			0
@entity99 , duty watch manager for @entity100 , which covers the @entity101 , warned ' jumping from piers , cliffs , rocks or other structures into the sea can be very dangerous '			0
' what was a deep pool at lunchtime might be a shallow puddle by teatime due to tidal conditions and you do not know what other hazards might be under the surface , ' he said			0
' tomb - stoning can be dangerous for a number of reasons - water depth alters with the tide and it may be shallower than it seems , submerged objects like rocks may not be visible , the shock of cold water may make it difficult to swim and strong currents can rapidly sweep people away			0
