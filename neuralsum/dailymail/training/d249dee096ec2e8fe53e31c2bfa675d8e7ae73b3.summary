@entity1 president @entity0 walks to 18th green as he plays golf at @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , during his winter holiday in january @entity0 has reportedly already ‘ checked out ’ of his job even though there are more than two years left until he leaves office in january 2017			1
the @entity1 president is said to have played 81 rounds of golf since re-election – as many as he played in his entire first term – and has holed himself up in @entity16 where he attends fundraisers and dinners with celebrities rather than tackling the day - to - day business of congressional politics			1
he is already all but a lame duck due to deadlock on @entity23 and has been forced to use executive powers to enact reforms			1
but come the mid-term elections in november , he could lose power entirely if the @entity28 take the @entity29			0
in the meantime , commentators claim he believes that his time in office is effectively over – and has begun enjoying himself			0
@entity1 reports say he has been house hunting and has looked at a £ 2.5million mansion in @entity37 , @entity38 – dubbed the ‘ playground of the presidents ’			1
mr @entity0 was also recently due to appear on a late night talk show hosted by comedian @entity42 , but cancelled after being savaged by the @entity1 media and @entity44			1
they claim that he has not responded strongly enough to the downing of @entity47 and needs to take a tougher line with @entity49			0
on the day of the crash mr @entity0 attended two fundraisers in @entity52 and went golfing three days later			2
an analysis by the @entity54 revealed that in the 628 days since re-election in 2012 , mr @entity0 has already matched the 81 days he spent playing golf in his entire first term			2
he has also attended 75 political fund raisers as the @entity59 claimed that he prefers to host public figures at the @entity61 late into the night rather than engage with the minutiae of politics on @entity23			2
a report in the newspaper this month said that on a trip to @entity69 earlier this year , the @entity1 @entity66 in @entity67 had to scramble together a host of intellectual figures at the last minute to attend a dinner party requested by the president			0
last week the @entity74 gave a potential glimpse into mr @entity0 ’s life post-presidency with a report which claimed he and first lady @entity79 had bought a home in @entity37 in the @entity38 desert			1
the property is in a gated community where entertainers @entity84 , @entity86 and @entity87 once maintained estates			0
the four - bedroom custom - built home also has a rock lagoon , two spas and 3.2 acres of land			0
a view of the home reportedly bought by the @entity95 in @entity37 in the @entity38 desert mr @entity0 has long faced criticism that he has not dirtied his hands with the day - to - day business of congressional politics and that this has contributed to the rancour on @entity23 which nearly brought about a government shutdown last year			1
if the @entity44 did take the @entity29 they would redouble their attempts to repeal his health care reform , the president ’s signature piece of domestic legislation			0
mr @entity0 will leave office in january 2017 and will be replaced by the winner of the 2016 presidential election , which could be @entity111 if she runs as the @entity113 candidate .			0

deadlock on @entity23 has already made @entity0 all but a lame duck
@entity1 media reports he has been house hunting in @entity38
if @entity44 win the mid-terms they may *dismantle* his *healthcare* policy
