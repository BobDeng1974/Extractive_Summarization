the comment to @entity1 , 49 , was made after general manager @entity2 was unimpressed by the way she had made up a room			1
the single mother was chided and abused in front of colleagues for no reason at the @entity22 in @entity23 , a tribunal heard			1
on another occasion , mr @entity2 picked up a cheesecake dessert in the staff canteen and said : ' if i drop this plate @entity1 will lick it up off the floor			1
' mr @entity2 , who is married with three children and a keen motorcyclist , also asked the @entity12 - born worker while in the kitchen : ' do you fancy a ride ?

' mr @entity2 also told mrs @entity1 she should have a relationship with an @entity42 - born security guard at the centre saying : ' he wants to stay his visa has expired			1

abuse : married father - of - three @entity2 who made crude remarks about his motorbike management claimed she pinched the bottoms of the male employees , cuddled and flirted with them , even suggested to one man that they go up to his flat			2
