people from around the @entity1 seem to have been having eerie premonitions of how the independence referendum will pan out - as maps of the @entity1 with @entity5 missing are appearing all over everyday objects			1
after the ominous vision first appeared in a cloud and then a piece of chicken from @entity12 , web users reacted by posting jokey pictures of their own ' revelations '			1
they include photographs of @entity1 appearing in pieces of bread , puddle and lumps of grilled cheese			2
@entity24 chose to include @entity5 on his map - on the grounds , he says , that we are ' butter together '			0
' i felt the referendum debate on both sides had become a bit heated and there needed to be some light relief , ' said mr @entity24 , from @entity48			0
' i created the shape out of aluminium to create a mould to bake the dough			0
' i thought it was appropriate for the last day of the campaigning , because it has been getting quite nasty in the last few days			0
' light - hearted : this piece of bread is suspiciously close to the outline of the @entity1 with @entity5 missing ominous : @entity59 described this piece of cheese as ' foreboding ' when she found it last week comparison : @entity64 provided a map to show how much her chicken looked like @entity67 the 57 - year - old baking enthusiast appeared on the hit @entity70 show last year , and made it to the fifth week of the competition			1

another @entity80 user , @entity79 , posted ' left - over paratha shaped like an early map of @entity1 '			1

' cross-cultural : at an @entity95 restaurant , a paratha took on an eerily similar aspect imprint : this yoghurt lid proved to look like it had a map on the inside the craze apparently started when a @entity5 woman living in @entity67 , @entity103 , took a photograph of a cloud which looks like @entity1 without @entity5			2
' i do n't know whether it 's an omen for the outcome of the @entity5 referendum , but i would n't be surprised if @entity5 vote yes , ' she said			0
