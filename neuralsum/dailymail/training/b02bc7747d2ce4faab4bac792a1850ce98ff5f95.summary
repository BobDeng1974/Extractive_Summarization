by @entity0 published : 01:19 est , 24 february 2014 @entity2 : 09:37 est , 24 february 2014 she was little more than 24 hours away from death and , in hindsight , the normally bubbly personality of vivacious @entity6 was subdued			1
not that @entity8 hosts @entity9 and @entity10 could have imagined that it was the last time they would see their regular mornings show guest alive			1
' [ looking back ] i thought she seemed a bit more subdued than normal , ' @entity14 told the @entity18			1
' normally she would be entertaining everybody from the get go			0
i just thought she seemed a little quieter than normal			1
' @entity22 arrived at the @entity32 studios between 7.30 and 8am last friday for hair and make - up , ahead of her appearance on a @entity8 segment to discuss the tenth anniversary of the hit television show , @entity41			1
by 9.10am , @entity22 was sitting in the studio waiting for the segment to go ahead			1
the ensuing performance by the seasoned on - air performer would later have @entity14 and @entity10 - in their grief the next day after learning of her fate - in an intense discussion about @entity22 's demeanour during her television appearance			1
what was to be @entity22 's last ever interview , was ostensibly just a spot on mornings , to which @entity22 had been contracted for the last two years			1
@entity22 brightened up and engaged in the discussion about @entity41 's message for women viewers , but she was a shadow of her usual self , @entity9 believes after @entity22 's final appearance ( above ) on @entity8 's mornings show , hosts @entity10 and @entity9 say her death has ' saddened ' and ' blindsided ' the network her humour still intact , @entity6 gave @entity10 one final ribbing in her usual ' affectionate ' style with decades of experience appearing on the network 's fashion , sports , lifestyle and news programmes , @entity22 was a popular member of @entity32 's ' television family '			1
' she was always laughing and hanging around with @entity77 [ @entity8 entertainment reporter , @entity78 ] in his room , ' @entity10 said			1
he said @entity8 ' producers had regularly chosen @entity81 for her always entertaining , forthright opinions and her fearless ' jousting ' with other guests , such as @entity85 tv reality contestant , @entity86 , whose views on immigration has seen her labelled a racist			2
' [ @entity81 's ] so great , ' @entity10 said			1
' her opinions are so valid			0
she would have a go			0
she was always having a go at me , in an affectionate , endearing way			0
' that was one of her charms			0
there was nothing nasty about @entity81			0
she was brutally honest , and that was one of the things that was so endearing about her			0
' @entity22 was to have one final ' go ' at @entity10			1
before the segment , @entity22 had posted on @entity105 a photo of herself , joking ' about to go on @ mornings9 to talk sex			2
as you can see i 'm racking my brains and have gone blank '			0
overwhelmed : @entity8 's mondays show hosts @entity9 and @entity10 paid tribute to @entity6 , having friend @entity114 ( pictured , above , with @entity22 ) on monday 's show , but found it overwhelming that @entity22 had been in the studio last friday and ' now would never be there again ' seated on the @entity8 couch with @entity120 , to debate whether @entity41 had empowered or damaged women , @entity22 seemed relaxed and soon displayed her trademark energy			1
it was only to @entity14 , and only , later , on reflection to @entity10 , that there was any a sense of something being awry with her			2
a lively discuss ensued , during which @entity10 remarked , ' it 's just a tv show ' , to which @entity22 , pointing at him , said , ' you loved it more than anyone '			1
' then she left , ' @entity10 said			2
' i do n't remember it being anything you could read something into			0
it was a simple ' see you guys later '			0
' the next morning @entity9 was in the @entity140 going about ' a normal saturday ' when the @entity8 executive producer called her			1
it was minutes before the story would break in the media			0
in @entity145 , @entity10 was backstage at @entity146 preparing to take part in a pantomime , when someone told him the news			2
' it was such a shock			0
it took the wind out of my sails , but i had to go on			0
' when both presenters arrived at the @entity32 on monday morning , @entity10 said ' a sad vibe lay across the whole network '			2
' it 's pretty raw			2
we were all aware of her depression			0
she would talk about it , use it as a punchline			0
we thought she might have been a bit quieter than usual , but you do n't see anything like that coming			2
' it really blindsided everybody			0
' with help from their producers , @entity14 and @entity10 prepared a @entity8 tribute for ' funny , warm , maternal ' @entity22 , consummate tv professional and ' caring friend '			1
' we report on a lot of stories , ' @entity10 said , ' but it was one of the hardest things			2
i just found it confronting , almost overwhelming , that last friday she was here and she will never be again			0

@entity6 was ' quieter than normal ' in last ever tv interview
@entity9 later realised @entity22 was not her usual self
the *47* - year - old sat back and , *unusually* , let others take the lead
the usually bubbly on air personality subdued 24 hours before death
nine stars *reconstruct* the moments of @entity22 's final appearance
@entity10 overwhelmed ' last friday she was here , she will never be again '
