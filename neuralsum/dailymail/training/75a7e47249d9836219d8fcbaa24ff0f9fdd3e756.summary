@entity1 and @entity2 are ready to make their @entity3 debuts as the @entity6 champions face a critical run of three games in the space of eight days , @entity0 has confirmed			1
@entity1 has been training with @entity3 for the last month since his shock switch from their @entity12 affiliate in @entity13 , while @entity2 has yet to play for the club following a £ 32million move from @entity16			1
both men could feature in saturday ’s trip to @entity19 , the @entity21 clash away to @entity22 or next weekend ’s clash with title favourites @entity24			1
‘ @entity1 is ready , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he has worked for about one month and he does n’t have any problems			0
@entity2 is working normally and is in the squad list also			1
‘ we have to play three games in a week so we will see if they play in these games			0
both of them are ready to do it but i ca n’t say which games they will play or if they will play			0
@entity45 will miss the @entity63 clash having featured in all of @entity3 's games so far this season ‘ but we have @entity45 injured			1
he has a muscle problem , maybe a couple of weeks more and also @entity47			2
he came back from his national team with a problem in his hamstring			0
‘ all the rest of the players are fit			0
@entity41 played 90 minutes for his national team and he works normally with the squad during the week here so he does n’t have any problems			0
’ addressing the media for the first time since @entity76 was allowed to leave the @entity77 on loan to @entity79 with a view to a permanent move , @entity0 confirmed that the striker was the odd man out in his @entity21 squad after fracturing a metatarsal in pre-season , and was also desperate to return to @entity86			2
@entity86 striker @entity76 completed his loan move to @entity79 from @entity3 on deadline day @entity76 ’s departure after one season in @entity92 football has left @entity3 with just three recognised senior strikers			2
@entity0 refused to say if they were in the running to sign @entity96 before he joined neighbours @entity97 , but believes that @entity3 have enough forwards to cope			1
he said : ‘ the decision for @entity76 to go out was for two very important reasons – first of all , we had a restriction on the number of players we can use in the @entity21 , we had one player more and in this case @entity76 was injured so he was not going to be on the list			0
‘ for him , it was also very important that he went back to @entity86 so i thought that was the best decision			0
but it all started with the restriction on the number of players			0
‘ it is one striker less of course , but we have @entity116 , @entity35 , @entity47 and other players we can use behind the strikers			2
’ @entity19 manager @entity121 hosts @entity0 's @entity3 side this weekend in a pivotal title race match @entity2 and @entity33 train ahead of @entity3 's trip to @entity19 @entity0 looks on during @entity3 training as his players get ready for a trip to @entity19 @entity3 skipper @entity41 is put through his paces in training @entity130 celebrates scoring as @entity19 held @entity3 to a 1 - 1 draw the last time at the @entity63			1
