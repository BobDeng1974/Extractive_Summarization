by @entity0 published : 17:58 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:58 est , 17 february 2014 concerns : dr @entity4 , of the @entity6 's gp committee , said the @entity8 s public information campaign for @entity9 had ' clearly ' not worked plans to harvest patients ’ private medical data were in crisis last night after the main doctors ’ union voiced ‘ deep concerns ’			1
the @entity6 , which represents 150,000 doctors , urged officials to delay the scheme – warning that patients had been left in the dark			1
it said surgeries across the country were being contacted by countless members of the public demanding to know what was going to happen with their confidential medical details			0
it emerged yesterday that @entity28 – which is overseeing the @entity9 project – had accepted there was a risk the database could be hacked into and used ‘ maliciously ’			0
the @entity33 voiced similar concerns last week and said the scheme had created a ‘ crisis in public confidence ’			1
such interventions from leading medical bodies have thrown the project into chaos just weeks before it is due to begin			0
starting next month , officials will begin extracting information about illnesses , prescriptions and test results from every patient ’s file unless they have opted - out			2
@entity28 officials say the details will be used to identify pockets of poor care but there is concern they will fall into the hands of hackers and insurance firms			0
the @entity6 is to hold urgent discussions with @entity28 later this week about how to better inform patients			1
dr @entity4 , of the @entity6 ’s gp committee , said the government ’s public information campaign for @entity9 had ‘ clearly ’ not worked			1
‘ with just weeks to go until the uploading of patient data is scheduled to begin , patients remain inadequately informed about these proposals , ’ he said			1
‘ gps across the country are telling us that large numbers of their patients have not received any information , and therefore remain completely unaware that their data will be uploaded , whilst others remain worried about who will have access to it and what it will be used for			1
‘ the @entity6 continues to support the principle of using anonymised data to plan and improve the quality of @entity28 care for patients			1
however this must be done with the support and consent of the public			0
’ it is thought that leaflets dropped through doors last month may have got lost or thrown out with junk mail			0
anger : several @entity67 ' groups have now spoken out over the planned changes by the @entity28 ( photo posed by models ) the @entity96 reported yesterday on a survey of 667 gps which found that 8 in 10 did not fully understand why the @entity28 needed to harvest the data			1
@entity28 officials say the information will be stored anonymously with only a patient ’s date of birth , postcode and @entity28 number kept on file alongside medical details			0
but experts say it would take only two hours for insurance firms , for example , to track down patients based on these details alone			2
potentially they could raise patients ’ premiums based on their medical conditions or family history of illness			2
@entity119 , of @entity120 said : ‘ if surgeries are forced to release patients ’ medical records without their properly informed consent , it will make providing good care even more difficult than it already is			2
‘ people will withhold everything that they fear may get into the wrong hands			0
diagnoses will become even harder and slower			0
’ while a risk assessment document produced by @entity28 had accepted the information could be used ‘ maliciously ’ , @entity133 , its national director for patients and information , insisted there were safeguards in place to prevent this .			0

@entity6 , which represents 150,000 gps , has urged government to delay *rollout*
@entity148 member dr @entity4 said patients were ill - informed
it comes after concerns were raised last week by the @entity33 of @entity67
