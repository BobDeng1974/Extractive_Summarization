i 've not played a game of cricket since i left school and so was a bit concerned when i was invited to play at the @entity5 vs @entity7 end of summer cricket match			1
for those of you who do n't live in @entity11 & @entity12 these are two of the biggest nightclubs in the @entity15 , and there 's a fierce rivalry between the two , so this looked like becoming a bit of grudge match			1
so much so that my team @entity22 employed the services of @entity24 & @entity26 cricketer @entity25			2
this and the fact that i had n't bowled a ball for at least eight years made me worry that i might end up letting the side down a bit			0
our innings was looking pretty good when @entity12 fell to @entity25 – at least he could say he was bowled by an @entity26 cricketer			2
@entity33 ( in bobble hat ) was on the @entity5 team for tug of war the @entity5 team lost to @entity7 and @entity33 says this is because they had more weight their end i 've got to say @entity12 did look impressive in whites – like a young @entity60 in @entity61 , only with a deep @entity63 tan			1
@entity64 however let the @entity5 side down , sartorially at least , by wearing his baseball cap back to front when he was keeping wicket , and his pre-match warm - up involved a cold bottle of beer			2
bizarrely @entity64 bumped into @entity70 who just happened to be walking past the ground , just behind @entity72			0
it has been noted several times before that the pair bear a slight resemblance , but the @entity77 rumours are not true – @entity70 is not @entity64 's father			0
@entity12 also joined @entity33 at the match and bumped into his celebrity look - a - like @entity81 it was all down - hill after lunch – there was a humiliating defeat in the lunchtime tug of war			1
if anything my @entity89 fitness and weight - loss regime has n't helped me here			1
you need a bit of heft behind you for this ' sport ' and i 've lost nearly a stone with the @entity96 and even though i 'm much more toned , it 's sheer bulk that you need to win this game			0
i was second in the row and kept my position but the guys behind lost their balance and the whole line collapsed and got dragged rather unceremoniously across the out - field			0
@entity33 says that @entity64 was showing him up by wearing a backwards baseball cap this drubbing in the tug of war must have hit us hard psychologically			1
our batting order collapsed in the same that we did with a rope in our hands			0
i only managed to score three runs and we lost by 165 to 85			0
we drowned our sorrows with some champagne ice lollies afterwards			0
lots of love , @entity33			2
old pal and ex @entity12 star @entity12 turned up in his cricket whites			1

@entity33 joined clubs @entity7 and @entity22 for a game of cricket
@entity33 blames tug of war *failure* on his *recent* weight loss
@entity12 *spotted* his look - a - like @entity81
