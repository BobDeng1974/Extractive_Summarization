two men cheated death after walking away from a horror smash with barely a scratch despite their car being hit head on by a cement mixer			1
the crash saw the large lorry filled with liquid concrete collide with the car and then pin it against a wall in the city of @entity14 in eastern @entity17 's @entity16 province			1
but not only were the two occupants of the car pulled from the wreckage alive , the also managed to survive without sustaining any serious injuries			2
emergency services worker @entity36 said : ' when we got there and saw what was left of the car , we instantly assume that if there was anyone inside they must be dead			0
' but then we heard someone call for help , and so we brought a crane in to move the cement mixer and ease the process of cutting the two people inside free			0
' we were convinced they would probably have horrific injuries			0
the crash happened after the cement driver apparently lost control of his lorry on a tight bend in treacherous road conditions following heavy downpours only the back of the car and the rear doors were recognisable after the smash and following the incident , the driver suffered a minor stroke and had to be hospitalised emergency worker @entity36 , one of the first at the scene said the rescuers were convinced the car 's occupants would probably have horrific injuries ' we could n't believe it when not just one person but two people were pulled out the wreckage and both of them were shocked but otherwise unhurt			1
' in pictures taken after the crash , only the rear door of the mangled car wreck is identifiable , and it seems impossible that there is any space inside for two people			0
mr @entity36 added : ' actually the person who was worst off was the cement mixer driver who had lost control and ploughed over the other side of the road into the car knocking it backwards into the wall			1
' when he saw the wreckage , and heard the two people inside screaming , he suffered a minor stroke and also had to be hospitalised			0
' the cement mixer driver apparently lost control of the vehicle on a tight bend after a sudden downpour of rain made the roads treacherous .			2
