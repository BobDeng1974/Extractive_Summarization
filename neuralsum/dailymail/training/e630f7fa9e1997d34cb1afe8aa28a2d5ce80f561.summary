by @entity0 published : 15:07 est , 4 july 2012 updated : 09:18 est , 5 july 2012 quaffing cocktails at beach houses and an @entity4 education - it is a lifestyle that seems at odds with someone capable of unleashing foul - mouthed tweets on @entity10 politicians			1
a day after sticking up two fingers at the @entity10 establishment , images reveal the charmed life of @entity15 , the @entity16 - educated daughter of disgraced @entity18 chief @entity17			1
images capture the 23 - year - old cosying up to award - winning @entity22 designer @entity21 , whose creations are adored by celebrities including @entity25 and @entity26			2
other photographs show @entity15 , who enjoyed a privileged upbringing in @entity10 schools and now works for @entity30 on @entity31 , parading designer dresses at @entity33 or charity events			1

in another photograph , she is shown vacationing in @entity60 , @entity61 and standing outside the five - star @entity63 hotel , where rooms cost between $ 650 and $ 4,000 a night			0
but despite this apparent hard partying lifestyle , friends told @entity68 does not drink and she spent more time in the library during her university years than in bars			1
this work ethic has continued in her job as an analyst for @entity30 , where she works 14 - hour days and briefly attends social events before returning home to bed , friends said			1
they added that she is humble about where she came from as she recognises her father , who earned millions each year as @entity18 chief , did not have much money in his younger years			1
one friend said she is not talking about her father 's recent resignation and , even though they are close , she will not be rushing to his side			1
instead , she has the outlook that ' life goes on '			0
serious : @entity15 , posing with a friend , sent an offensive tweet to politicians to stick up for her father on tuesday @entity95 : she lives in @entity22 with college friends and works as an analyst for @entity30 on @entity31 @entity98 girl : miss @entity15 and a friend prepare for last year 's @entity101 @entity15 has stayed in touch with university friends , and shares a rented apartment with them in @entity106			1
she studied at the $ 25,000 - a - year @entity107 in @entity108 , before going to @entity16 , where she was president of the @entity110 sorority			1
the @entity30 analyst is also a campaigner for @entity111 and was named by website @entity112 as one of ' @entity31 ’s @entity114 '			1
this privileged education and high - flying career - as well as her well - preened appearance - are at odds with the foul - mouthed remarks she made on @entity120 on tuesday			2
@entity15 jumped to the defense of her father @entity17 after he quit his $ 8 million - a - year role over the @entity125 interest rate fixing scandal			1
she took to @entity120 to tell @entity10 politicians @entity127 and @entity128 to ' go ahead and # @entity129 ' - an abbreviation for ' hold my d * * * '			1

instead , she wrote : ' no one in the world i admire more than my dad			0
shame to see the mistakes of few tarnish the hard work of so many			0
' miss @entity15 did not respond to @entity68 's requests for a comment			1
amid pictures of designer shoes and fashion shows on @entity15 's own @entity120 account , other images hint at her close relationship with her father			1
in november last year she tweeted a picture of them together at a @entity161 concert making his famous ' diamond ' hand gesture - actually a symbol for his @entity166 company			0
her tweets came after mr @entity17 fell on his sword amid intense pressure from on the bank to force him out , it was claimed			0
as he announced his resignation , mr @entity17 said he was standing down because : ' the external pressure placed on @entity18 has reached a level that risks damaging the franchise			2
' diamonds are together : @entity177 with her father @entity178 in a private box at a @entity161 concert last year			2
the young bank worker came out in support of her father today @entity17 in a @entity16 hoodie - the university attended by his daughter @entity15 , not him pricey : in another picture , she poses outside the @entity63 , a five - star hotel in @entity60 , @entity61 mr @entity17 was grilled in the @entity190 on wednesday and his resignation a day earlier left him free to speak openly about what went on at the bank			1
he apologised as he admitted there had ' clearly been mistakes ' and ' reprehensible behaviour ' at the bank , while adding that he had stepped down to prevent anymore damage to the bank			0
but he declared ' i love @entity18 ' , and added : ' history will judge @entity18 as an incredible institution because of its people			2
we need to get through this and best way was for me to step down			0
' the millionaire banker , 61 , came under pressure from visibly angry mps as he swerved questions , repeatedly saying that it had been ' wrong ' for a ' handful ' of traders to fix the rate at which @entity18 borrowed from other banks - potentially affecting millions of homeowners			2
all a @entity120 : she took down her offensive tweet minutes after posting it , but not before it was retweeted by @entity220 journalist @entity219 sense of humour : she also retweeted cutting messages about her father @entity17 mr @entity17 admitted his shame over damming emails between staff who were fixing the interest rate			2
in one , a trader at a different bank wrote to ' trader g ' at @entity18 : ' dude			2
i owe you big time ! come over one day after work and i ’m opening a bottle of @entity238			0
' mr @entity17 said he was ‘ physically ill ’ when he read emails			0
other emails revealed how they would ‘ shout ’ across the desk at each other to ‘ beg ’ for the interest rate to be fixed at a certain level in the hope of making millions for themselves			0
another said : ‘ coffees will be coming your way either way , just to say thank you for your help in the past few weeks			0
’ his colleague replied : ‘ done ... for you big boy			0
’ expensive taste : @entity15 made an appearance at @entity260 , left , and @entity261 , right family : @entity15 is the only daughter of @entity178 and @entity264 on the social scene : she attends the launch of the @entity267 last month , left , and the @entity268 in @entity22 last november mr @entity17 said : ‘ that behaviour was reprehensible , it was wrong			1
i ’m sorry , i ’m disappointed and i ’m also angry			0
there is absolutely no excuse for this type of behaviour			0
' but he pointed the finger at ' 14 or 15 ' other banks - including government - owned @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279 - suggesting that they were lying about their rates			0
mr @entity17 is said to be furious that he and the bank have been blamed for ‘ lowballing ’ the rates at which @entity18 said it could borrow from rivals			2
bankers insist the authorities knew these rates were inaccurate but did not act because they feared the truth would destabilise the markets			0
it is also claimed that regulators possessed evidence of rate - fixing			0
snap happy : @entity15 appears to be a prolific social networker , posting numerous pictures of herself at various events mr @entity17 is in line to pocket 13.2million shares worth $ 35 million - which he is entitled to because he has served for more than 15 years - as part of a golden pay off			2

mr @entity17 , who joined the bank 16 years ago , said in his resignation statement : ' i am deeply disappointed that the impression created by the events announced last week about what @entity18 and its people stand for could not be further from the truth			2
' grilling : @entity17 was questioned by the @entity314 this afternoon fallen on their swords : @entity17 ( centre ) and chairman @entity318 ( right ) , pictured here with former chief - executive @entity321 , have both resigned over the libor rate scandal ' my motivation has always been to do what i believed to be in the best interests of @entity18			1
no decision over that period was as hard as the one that i make now to stand down as chief executive			0
' he went on : ' i know that each and every one of the people at @entity18 works hard every day to serve our customers and clients			1
that is how we support economic growth and the communities in which we live and work			0
' he added : ' i leave behind an extraordinarily talented management team that i know is well placed to help the business emerge from this difficult period as one of the leaders in the global banking industry			0
