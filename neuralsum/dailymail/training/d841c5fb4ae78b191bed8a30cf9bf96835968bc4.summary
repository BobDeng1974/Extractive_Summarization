by @entity0 published : 16:48 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 04:04 est , 13 june 2013 two o'clock in the morning and i 'm sitting on the side of the bed , drenched in sweat			1
it 's minus five outside , yet the skylight window is wide open and a fan is whirring by my side			1
the damp bed is so uncomfortable that i have to change the sheets and pillowcases before i can go back to sleep - even though i need to be up in four hours ' time			1
when it 's at its worst - at least once a month - i sleep in the spare bedroom			1
@entity16 , my other half , has been incredibly supportive , even though he 's been as sleep - deprived as me over the years			1
i 'd love to pause the ' change ' - my menopause is a ' waking nightmare ' , says @entity0 this waking nightmare is my menopause - my so - called ' change '			1
it 's four years since it started , i have no idea when it will end and it 's causing my life to disintegrate around me			1
i hate and resent it , and can not understand why any woman would relish it			1
indeed , in last week 's @entity31 , @entity29 , the esteemed broadcaster and journalist , offered the somewhat controversial view that the menopause ' ushers in the best years of a woman 's life '			1
she was writing in response to research which claims women will eventually evolve out of the menopause , as we continue to have children later and later			1
i 'm afraid i can not meet it with ' courage and adventure ' as @entity29 suggests			2
any sense of adventure i might have had has been long lost in the myriad of ailments and conditions i am grappling with			2
since the onset of menopause i have not been able to wear shoes indoors , as my feet are so hot			1
even on the coldest day i sit in meetings , colleagues in fur - lined boots staring bemused at my bare toes			2
i wear thin linen clothing throughout the year and even then i find being in most buildings impossible			2
a trip to the local supermarket is like an invitation to a sauna			2
you 'll always find me in chilled foods			2
there really is nothing like a hot flush			2
if you 've never had one , you may think it 's just like going red with embarrassment			1
but it 's so much worse			1
it starts from within - like molten lava - and slowly takes you over			2
controversial : @entity29 believes that menopause ' ushers in the best years of a woman 's life ' it stops me mid-task and i am overwhelmed by the heat			1
it makes my ears ring and i feel sick and forget what i am doing or what i am saying			2
sometimes the side - effects are so debilitating and distressing that it 's tempting not to leave @entity89 i did make it to work - until last year i was a producer at the @entity91 - i would find myself erupting into huge rages over the office heating			1
' if it 's 25 degrees you should be on a beach in a bikini , ' i would shout , and ram the thermostat down to 16c			1
i once actually snarled : ' i am the producer , i will decide what temperature to have			2
' to get out of bed in the morning is a relief from the night sweats , but then begins a day marred by terrible tiredness , hot flushes and confusion			2
i constantly write lists so i do n't forget things			2
on bad days i feel as if i 'm losing my mind , just clinging on to reality			2
so much for a sense of adventure ! my menopause started when i was 50 and had a total hysterectomy			1
abnormal cells were found in my womb , which if left could have led to cancer , so i had my womb and ovaries removed			1
with my ovaries went my supply of the female hormone oestrogen			2
instead of having the slow dwindle of fertility that nature intends , i had what 's called a surgical menopause , when everything happens at once			1
i was still hooked up to a drip the day after surgery when the first sweats arrived			2
there was very little discussion in hospital about what i was to expect , as if the surgery and the after - effects were completely unrelated			2
i left hospital with nothing more than the internet to guide me			1
i found myself reading about all kinds of cures , from the conventional ( hormone replacement therapy ) to herbal remedies ( black cohosh and red clover ) and the utterly bizarre medication which is oestrogen extracted from the urine of pregnant mares			0
i went down the conventional route , and , full of hope , began a course of @entity155			0
within days , my breasts felt painful and engorged			0
i became depressed and confused and - worse - the sweats and flushes did n't even abate			0
' oh , did i mention the mood swings ? i did n't just snarl about the air conditioning , one minute i was ranting at the poor dog for getting under my feet , the next i was in floods of tears when i 'd accidentally broken a glass in the kitchen			0
' i gave it some time for the tablets to kick in - during which my already huge bosom went up a full cupsize - but i only became more bloated , itchy and frankly miserable			0
so , about six months later i came off it			0
i tried red clover and other natural remedies but quickly realised nothing was going to work			0
i sometimes think i genuinely do have dementia , such is my lack of recall at times			0
my children laugh at me kindly , because i use the wrong words and forget key names and dates			0
i once told them an elderly neighbour had to be taken to prison , which had them flabbergasted			0
eventually they discovered i meant hospital			0
after my operation , my once impressive memory was shot to pieces			0
suddenly i could n't remember the names of colleagues i 'd worked with for years			0
one reporter was called @entity196 so often she started answering to it â€“ even though she 's really called @entity198			1
i finally left my job at the @entity91 , which was in part down to the menopause			1
the building was incredibly hot and i found i was so exhausted when i got home			0
oh , did i mention the mood swings ? i did n't just snarl about the air conditioning , one minute i was ranting at the poor dog for getting under my feet , the next i was in floods of tears when i 'd accidentally broken a glass in the kitchen			0
and if my mind was breaking down , my body felt like an alien being , too			0
the lack of oestrogen has left the skin on my arms and legs dehydrated and itchy , which drives me to despair			1
sometimes i scratch until i bleed , even though there is no rash to be seen			0
my hair is turning into a @entity225 pad - i resemble @entity226 , the @entity227 character in @entity228 feel as if i have taken the express route to old age			0
the menopause is still thought of as something women just have to get on with , and this means , on top of all my symptoms , i feel like a failure because i struggle to cope			1
when my grandmother was going through @entity239 , there was no discussion about it at all			0
likewise my mum , a district nurse , had to get on her bike and visit her patients as if she had n't a care in the world			0
it 's getting hot in here : for those with the menopause , hot flushes can be deeply debilitating it was a personal battle women kept to themselves			1
my friend 's mum would vacuum in her bra and skirt because of her hot flushes			1
yet nothing was ever said , and no one ever questioned her			0
that was 30 years ago and it appears nothing much has changed			0
like generations of women before me , i have to get on with it			0
i have two young daughters , a partner and a dog , and an exciting job as a freelance tv producer , writer and lecturer			1
the alarm goes off daily at 6am and there is no going back to bed			0
yet some of the effects of the menopause are illnesses in themselves			1
just imagine a man or young woman waking repeatedly in the night , clothes soaked through and having to change the bed			1
would they just get up in the morning and go to work ? more than likely they would ring in sick and get a sympathetic hearing			0
but i wonder how many older women would do that			0
ring in and talk menopause with their bosses ? no thanks			1
recently , a friend had to take some time off work to recover from the fallout of her menopause			1
on her return , she was interviewed by two young male managers about her leave			0
she tried to explain her problems , but they stopped her mid-flow			0
either they could n't cope with ' women 's problems ' or they just did n't want to know			1
luckily for me , my doctor told me about clinical trials of specific anti-depressants , which had shown promising results controlling night sweats and flushes in menopausal women			0
so far they are helping me , but they 're all i have			0
because there is just no cure for this force of nature			0
if there was , i am sure i would be first in a very long line of women wanting it .			0

@entity0 's menopause started when she had a total hysterectomy
