a newly developed body armour , complete with built - in sensors that can measure the damage a hit would cause to the unprotected body , is set to revolutionise the sport of mixed martial arts			1
the high - tech armour , has been designed by @entity8 , not only to protect but also to register the real force behind each strike			1
a team of engineers from @entity13 spent four years developing the @entity15 - like armour , which is designed to be flexible enough to fight in and uses built - in sensors to calculate and display the damage a weapon hit would have done to an unprotected body			1
@entity8 , is set to run competitions later this year with bouts featuring world - class martial artists engaging in combat with weapons			1
' @entity8 ’s vision is to create a large - scale sport and entertainment experience where martial artists can compete against each other with real weapons , with an objective measure of who would have won in a real combat situation , ' @entity8 ceo @entity40 says			1
' this is something that has not been possible since the days of the @entity51 , ' said @entity40 , @entity8 ceo and experienced martial artist			1

@entity8 chairman , @entity76 says he was inspired to develop @entity8 because he wanted to re-ignite interest in hidden weapons arts , many of which he says are at risk of being lost forever			2
' @entity8 is the creation of a new global combat sport that combines thousands of years of history with cutting - edge technology to create a unique martial arts experience , ' @entity76 says			2
' the arts that @entity8 will showcase have been passed down from master to student for generations and are closely linked to the national cultures , histories and identities of these countries			2
' ' our vision is to bring these ancient weapons arts to the global stage			0

head protection : high - tech helmet worn during battle to protect competitor and register damage caused by hits until a fighter is virtually knocked out or killed the @entity8 armour features technology that objectively measures the specific location and force of strikes to a competitor ’s suit of armour			1
using medical research , including fracture profiling , software calculates and represents the actual damage that would have occurred to an unprotected competitor			1
it then processes a result , similar to a video game , but based on real , full - contact martial arts weapons combat , all in real - time			0
the armour has been designed to withstand high - impact strikes from real , but blunt , martial arts weapons			0
damage caused by hits accumulates until a competitor is virtually ‘ knocked out ’ or ‘ killed ’ , with a strike or a series of strikes of sufficient force to render an unprotected competitor incapacitated			1
competitors can have multiple ‘ lives ’ , just like in a video game , in order to prolong the duration of the bouts			0
the winner can also be determined based on a points system using impact data from the fight			0
