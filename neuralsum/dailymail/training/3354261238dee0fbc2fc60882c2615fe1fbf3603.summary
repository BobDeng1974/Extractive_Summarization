@entity0 has taken hot dogs to a whole new level			2
a meal which is traditionally served as a sausage in a sliced bun is now being offered inside a fillet of fried chicken breast at select @entity0 stores			1
the fast food chain 's @entity9 is also topped with cheese , honey mustard and relish dressing			1
however some took to social media to express their disappointment as the hot dog failed to satisfy their taste buds			2
on the day of its launch , yesterday , @entity0 announced that its ' outrageously meaty @entity38 have been sold out in all participating stores '			2
while the new addition as been described as the ' meatiest original recipe chicken fillet with a tender juicy chick'n cheese hot dog topped with honey mustard and relish dressing ' , it was n't so appetising when customers made their purchase			1
' it 's very disappointing that there 's no more truth in advertising			0
look at this double down dog that i got			0
not worth it , ' one unimpressed customer wrote after posting a photo of his hot dog on @entity0 's facebook page			1
others embraced the new addition and were excited to try it out			0
' we must try this , ' a customer wrote as she tagged a friend			0
' damn i want , ' another wrote			0
@entity0 's new hot dog has ditched the piece of bread and is instead served wrapped in a fried chicken breast in exchange for the piece of bread it appears @entity29 customers were eager to take a bite out of the meaty treat on the day of its launch , yesterday , @entity0 announced that its ' outrageously meaty @entity38 have been sold out in all participating stores ' sadly for @entity81 @entity0 enthusiasts , the fast - food giant says there are no plans to add the fatty fried treat to menus in @entity81 stores			1
the hot dog entombed in fried chicken calls to mind @entity0 's infamous @entity91 sandwich , which was introduced in select locations in the @entity81 back in 2010			1
the gut - busting offering featured bacon and two kinds of gooey cheese squeezed between two pieces of chicken fillets .			0
