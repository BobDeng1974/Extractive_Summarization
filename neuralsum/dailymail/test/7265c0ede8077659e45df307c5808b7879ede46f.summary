when even injuries are working in @entity4 's favour , the other teams around the relegation zone should begin to worry			1
@entity5 was not supposed to be starting this match , left out in favour of @entity8			2
but when @entity9 suffered injury in the warm - up , @entity5 was sent on			1
inside 15 minutes he scored a goal that provided the platform for a victory that looks increasingly like being part of a truly great escape			1
that familiar melody was hummed loudly by @entity4 's fans at full - time , fuelled by @entity21 's late second goal and the sight of their team moving off the bottom of the table for the first time since november			1
@entity4 defender @entity28 ( left ) hassles @entity30 playmaker @entity29 ( right ) for the ball at the @entity32 @entity30 winger @entity33 ( centre ) jumps to avoid the challenges of @entity4 defenders as he surges forward on saturday @entity30 midfielder @entity37 ( left ) prepares to block a cross from @entity4 's @entity39 during the @entity41 match @entity4 's @entity21 slides in with a strong challenge on @entity30 forward @entity43 during the match at the @entity32 @entity4 ( 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity45 7 ; @entity46 6 ( @entity47 46 ’ 6 ) , @entity48 6.5 , @entity49 6.5 ; @entity50 7 , @entity21 7 , @entity39 7.5 , @entity51 6.5 ; @entity8 6 ( @entity52 74 ’ ) ; @entity5 7 ( @entity53 68 ’ 6 ) , @entity54 7 subs not used : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 manager : @entity61 7.5 @entity30 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity62 6.5 ; @entity63 6 , @entity64 5.5 , @entity65 6 , @entity66 5.5 ; @entity67 6 , @entity68 5.5 ( @entity69 58 ’ 6 ) ; @entity33 6 ( @entity70 70 ’ 5 ) , @entity71 6 , @entity29 5 ; @entity43 5 ( @entity72 75 ’ 5 ) subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 booked : @entity66 , @entity71 manager : @entity79 6 referee : @entity81 attendance : 31,121 @entity83 : @entity39 @entity5 gives @entity4 the lead , scoring from @entity49 's knock down one more goal would have taken them out of the relegation places instead of @entity88 , but much more like this and that will come			1
this is three @entity41 wins in a row for the first time since 2000			1
manager @entity61 has been here before			0
@entity4 emerged for this game looking like , one imagines , the pack of dogs that @entity61 once fought off with a stick while hiking in the @entity100			2
his side are finally bearing teeth at the end of an arduous season , two wins in succession providing genuine hope of a remarkable surge to safety			0
shifting off the bottom for the first time since november was the carrot for this game should defeat be avoided			0
@entity61 selected an attacking side , a 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 with genuine wingers in the wide roles			2
he sent on @entity5 for the injured @entity9 and played @entity8 as no 10			2
@entity39 ( front ) stretches to control the ball ahead of the oncoming @entity30 forward @entity119 ( behind ) at the @entity32 @entity4 hitman @entity120 ( right ) strikes the ball to score his side 's opening goal against @entity30 during the match on saturday the home side began with feral ferocity			1
straight from kick - off @entity54 drove at the @entity30 defence only being halted at the last by @entity64			1
the lead @entity4 craved was theirs in the 15th minute			2
@entity5 made the @entity41 sit up and take notice at the start of the season with a flurry of goals , but his failure to maintain the momentum contributed largely to @entity4 's decline			1
this was his first @entity41 goal in four months , but what an important one			1
following a corner the ball was recycled to @entity46 , who launched a long ball from halfway that @entity5 flicked - on to @entity49 , who had stayed up			1
the centre - back fed it back to the @entity146 who lashed home under the diving leg of @entity65			2
the @entity32 erupted , and @entity5 ran to the dugout to @entity151 , the club 's player liaison officer , and share a hug			0
@entity4 are very much together at the crucial stage of the season , as this performance illustrated			0
@entity30 were nothing like their fluid best , restricted to long shots easily held by @entity45			0
at half - time @entity46 was forced off , with @entity161 coming on , and @entity4 switched to four at the back			1
three minutes after the break @entity50 fired a shot narrowly wide , and shortly after @entity8 sent a chance over following a breakaway			0
@entity45 saved well from @entity71 , was again from range , but it was @entity4 unpicking @entity30 's defence with greater frequency			1
in the 55th minute @entity54 crossed to @entity5 , who sent his header onto the roof of the net while back - peddling			2
a minute later , @entity5 got free down right and centred , @entity54 miscued and @entity8 ballooned a very good opening over			2
this has been a theme of @entity4 's season , always positive but too often missing chances			0
it has previously proved costly			0
it would have done again in the 67th minute , but for a stunning save by @entity45			0
@entity43 ran clear and stayed on his feet when @entity48 made a desperate lunge – referee @entity81 could have awarded a penalty and possibly red in any case			0
@entity45 came out in star jump fashion – like his dad @entity187 – and thwarted @entity43 's finish			0
@entity5 rushes over to supporters to celebrate a crucial goal in the club 's bid to avoid relegation from the @entity41 this season @entity4 's @entity8 ( left ) has a shot at goal blocked by @entity30 centre - back @entity66 ( right ) at the @entity32 @entity30 boss @entity79 ( right ) gives instructions to defender @entity63 ( left ) during the match against @entity4 on saturday @entity46 ( centre left ) gives chase to @entity30 's @entity200 ( centre ) who surges forward with the ball for the visitors on saturday @entity4 skipper @entity49 slides in with a strong challenge from behind on @entity30 winger @entity33 during the match on saturday @entity49 ( right ) tussles for possession with @entity210 ( left ) as @entity4 take on @entity30 at the @entity32 on saturday @entity4 's @entity21 ( right ) jumps highest to head the ball away from @entity30 's @entity43 during the @entity41 match on saturday @entity45 grasped the ball and blew out his cheeks moments later after saving another snap shot from @entity71			1
@entity69 than saw his shot deflect wide off @entity49 when it could have gone anywhere			0
from then the game was @entity4 's			0
through @entity54 , @entity50 and substitute @entity53 they possessed pace to counter at speed @entity30 struggled to handle			0
in the 73rd minute @entity54 led a two - on - one breakaway but over-hit his pass to @entity53 allowing @entity62 time to dive and block			0
@entity54 was again clear six minutes later through @entity225 's pass and fell under contact from @entity65 as he pushed the ball past the @entity30 captain			2
@entity61 was incensed but it would have been soft			0
@entity54 sent another chance over , and @entity62 palmed wide a stinging shot by @entity53			0
but a minute from time @entity4 did seal the win			1
@entity39 , superb all afternoon , fired a free - kick through @entity30 's wall , @entity62 spilled the ball , and @entity21 applied the required tap - in			1
@entity30 midfielder @entity71 ( left ) skips away from the challenge of @entity4 winger @entity50 during the match on saturday king scores @entity4 's second goal on the rebound following @entity39 's parried free - kick to secure a 2 - 0 win for the home side @entity21 celebrates his goal which sees @entity4 move off the bottom of the @entity41 table for the first time since november last year			1

@entity4 claimed three @entity41 victories in a row for the first time since *september* 2000
@entity146 forward @entity5 scored the opening goal on 15 minutes before @entity21 netted a second late on
despite the 2 - 0 win over @entity30 the @entity258 are still in the relegation places on goal *difference*
