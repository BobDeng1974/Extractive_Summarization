another game , another excellent referee - this time @entity3 's @entity2 - turning in a weak performance			2
first there was a huge kick on @entity8 ’s achilles by @entity9 which escaped a caution and moments later @entity12 blatantly body checked @entity14 but again no yellow card			2
that @entity16 was cautioned just on half time did nothing to suggest laws might be applied correctly and sure enough @entity20 committed another body check in the second minute of the second half and was not shown a card			0
no action : @entity9 checks on @entity25 's @entity8 after the @entity27 's @entity26 tackle blatant : @entity25 's @entity12 got away with a deliberate body check on @entity14 punished : @entity16 was substituted soon after he was finally booked by @entity2 remonstrating : ( from left ) @entity30 and @entity14 argue with @entity2 after the @entity9 booking @entity2 is a strict referee who follows instructions ; @entity34 ’s dismissal at @entity35 against @entity36 showed that			1
@entity38 deny that they have ' instructed ' referees to perform this way but what i have witnessed throughout this competition is very good and experienced referees appearing to do their jobs in ' @entity38 handcuffs ' – restricting the correct use of the red and yellow cards that law demands			1
more injuries may follow and the final could again be spoiled by excessive physical challenges being allowed			0
off @entity54 : @entity20 ( left ) went unpunished for a body check in the second half eventually : @entity2 booked @entity9 after a foul on @entity58			0

the @entity3 *semi-final* referee eventually gave three yellow cards
@entity63 's @entity9 and @entity25 's @entity12 were booked but should have been punished earlier in the match
@entity38 says they have *n't* advised referees to do so , but the officials appear to be acting too *leniently*
