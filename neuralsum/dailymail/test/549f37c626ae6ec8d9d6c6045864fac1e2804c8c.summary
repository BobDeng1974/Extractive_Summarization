do n't play @entity1 - @entity0 with this guy ... @entity3 has been able to do just about anything he wants during his team 's first three playoff games this season and that has apparently carried over to practice as well			1
@entity3 was at practice with his @entity11 teammates on saturday at the @entity12 in @entity13 before their game against the @entity13 on sunday afternoon			1
during a break in the action , @entity3 decided to practice his long - range shooting			2
the one - handed shot , which traveled almost the entire length of the 94 - foot court , dropped through the basket with an audible swish			2
just before the full - court shot hit nothing but net , ' @entity3 ' said : ' give me my money '			1
it 's unclear who , if anyone @entity44 with , but @entity46 did seem as if he was trying to disrupt the @entity48 's concentration before the shot			0
@entity46 was also teammates with @entity3 when they both played for the @entity52			0
in 13 career postseason games in @entity13 , @entity3 is averaging about 29 points , nine rebounds , and six assists after the video began to spread via social media , @entity57 of the @entity58 issued a response			1
in a clip the team posted , the center is seen swishing a one - handed shot of his own while wearing a yellow backpack			0
instead of tossing the ball overhand , @entity57 used a motion that was one part underhand and one part sidearm to make his full - court shot find paydirt			2
apparently @entity74 's nickname - is just as powerful as the @entity3			0
after the video began to spread via social media , @entity57 of the @entity58 issued a response the @entity78 hold a 3 - 0 lead in their @entity81 first - round playoff series against the @entity13			1

he has won two championships but lost to the @entity99 and @entity100			0
