@entity1 winger @entity0 is still waiting for the club to open talks over a new contract , with @entity6 side @entity5 interested in signing the player who first caught the eye during a pre-season tournament in @entity10			1
@entity11 understands that @entity0 and @entity12 are yet to sit down to discuss an improvement to his first professional deal , signed only in april and set to expire in the summer of 2016			1
the player ’s representatives are surprised by the delay and hope the 19 - year - old will be rewarded for his senior breakthrough and involvement in the @entity22 under 20 set - up , where he has won an admirer in @entity25			1
@entity1 's @entity0 tussles with @entity27 's @entity26 in the league cup game in october @entity0 scored his first competitive goal for @entity1 against @entity27 in the league cup in october the @entity22 boss is not the only one impressed by the @entity33 - born teenager			1
@entity27 and @entity34 are both circling , but it is the interest from @entity5 which is strongest			2
they noted @entity0 ’ name back in august when the then unknown wideman lit up a four - team tournament at the @entity40			1
indeed , he scored his first senior goal in a 3 - 1 win over the hosts and his performance that weekend won him permanent elevation to @entity47 ’s first - team ranks			1
@entity0 , though , is currently sidelined with a hamstring problem and will miss saturday 's visit of @entity50			2
the 19 - year - old is congratulated by @entity1 manager @entity47 after scoring against @entity27 @entity1 – victorious in their last five in all competitions – will be without injured skipper @entity54 and vice-captain @entity55 , while @entity56 and @entity57 are also absent			1
striker @entity58 is still struggling for his fitness – despite scoring in midweek for @entity60 – and will not start , meaning @entity61 will again lead the line			1
the 21 - year - old @entity63 has scored three in three – his last an exquisite back - heel in the victory at @entity66 – and has been the subject of headlines comparing him to some of the club ’s great no 9s , not that @entity47 welcomes such exposure			1
‘ some of the headlines have been way off the mark – the new @entity76 , the new @entity77 , ’ said the @entity12 boss			2
@entity61 scores with an exquisite back - heel against @entity66 in @entity1 's last @entity80 game the 21 - year - old celebrates with @entity0 after scoring the winning goal against @entity34 this month ‘ this is a boy who has played three games			1
those players are legends and have done it all			0
‘ but at the moment he ’s fearless			0
he ’s got the wind in his sails and is going along very nicely			0
he ’s been very sharp in training			0
‘ if you take your eye off him he ’s a predator			0
i ’m sure @entity50 will be having conversations of how to look after him			0
he ’s difficult to pin down , his movement is very clever			0
‘ he is just setting foot in the @entity80 , but i have to say he ’s done really well so far			0
i ’m pleased with him			0
he ’s a smashing player and is low maintenance			0
’ meanwhile , @entity47 has defended his decision to tell @entity103 to find a new club after the player first returned from testicular cancer treatment last december			1
@entity103 was told that he did not feature in @entity1 's plans last december @entity47 , pictured taking a @entity1 training session , insists the decision was ' purely football ' the 31 - year - old is due back on @entity111 next month having successfully fought the illness for a second time and has spoken in his homeland of his disappointment with events of 12 months ago			1
but @entity47 said : ‘ it was a pure football decision and those are decisions that have to be made			2
‘ it ’s difficult – when you ’ve said to a player to get a new club and unfortunately the illness has come			2
‘ you try to be supportive but , of course , the players wants to find a bit more assurance than that			0
‘ but that decision was a 100 per cent football decision			2
i want to invite @entity103 back and give him the best possible chance when he returns			2
‘ what he has done is absolutely marvellous , to recover like he has			0
‘ we ’re very proud of what he ’s done			0

@entity0 signed his first professional contract with @entity1 in april
the 19 - year - old 's rise has been *meteoric* since the start of the season
he broke into the first team and has since represented @entity149 20s
@entity5 interest comes after @entity0 impressed against them pre-season
@entity47 said comparisons between striker @entity61 and @entity76 are way off the mark
but the @entity1 manager *praised* the 21 - year - old for his start at the club
@entity47 also said the decision to tell @entity103 he did not feature in his plans last *decmber* was purely a ' football one '
