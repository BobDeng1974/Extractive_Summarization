by @entity0 published : 17:49 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 17:49 est , 12 june 2013 fashion friends : @entity3 's ex-creative director @entity2 with @entity4 the fashion world tripped over its platform shoes this week at the news that @entity3 's creative director @entity2 had abandoned ship			1
apparently , the one - woman whirlwind from @entity10 had major ' disagreements ' with the company 's new ceo , @entity14 @entity12			1
@entity3 's share price dipped 8 per cent at the terse announcement			1
given that @entity2 is the transformative designer who turned @entity3 into a fashion player and a magnet for celebrities from @entity21 to the @entity22 , it was rather like watching the leading lady storm off in the first act			1
indeed , @entity3 has had more blood on its floor than a @entity28 drama			2
only last week @entity2 picked up a @entity29 for @entity30			2
@entity32 's may issue profiled her as ' one of the most successful names in @entity36 fashion , ' and called her a ' visionary '			1
last summer she became a cbe			0
even @entity39 of @entity40 , who designed the royal wedding dress , was only made an mbe			0
@entity2 was @entity3 , @entity3 was @entity2			1
together , they had become a @entity36 institution			0
who would have thought that they could have ever been parted ? but it seems selling lots of handbags in @entity36 is n't enough any more			0
@entity3 has had some hits and seen an underlying rise in its rollercoaster share price , but is altogether a much patchier story than that of its home - grown rival @entity55 , which has spread its trademark check over the lucrative @entity59 market , and everywhere else			1
much to the chagrin of @entity3 's elusive @entity62 owner , @entity61 , who wrestled the company from founder @entity64 in a nasty boardroom coup ten years ago , it does n't seem to have the global clout she desired			1
there was a time , of course , when it seemed @entity3 could do no wrong			2
take the strappy @entity71 bag , named after @entity72 and based on a man 's satchel			2
@entity2 called the @entity71 ' the @entity76 bag that became an it bag ' , so popular that it once had a waiting list that ran into thousands and accounted for a staggering third of @entity3 's sales			1
combined with the classic @entity82 , by 2011 @entity3 was the fastest growing luxury brand on the planet ; sales in its 86 stores soared			1
last year , @entity61 hired a @entity14 luxury goods executive to take @entity3 from fashionable @entity36 bag maker to high - end international brand			1
and so @entity3 poached @entity12 from @entity91 , the snootiest of all the @entity14 luxury brands			1
to @entity91 , @entity93 are mere parvenus , @entity96 attention - seekers			2
as you might imagine , @entity14 luxury goods executives are not noted for their sense of humour			0
so heaven knows what monsieur @entity12 made of @entity3 using giant gnomes as show props and poodles on the catwalk - or , more to the point , what he thought of the exuberant ms hill			1
@entity36 success : hill with her @entity111 cue ' a culture clash of titanic proportions ' , as one @entity36 magazine editor described it to me			0
@entity2 , who joined @entity3 in 2008 and had worked at @entity117 and @entity118 , grew the brand by courting cool young things and promoting the brand at festivals			1
as well as @entity72 , @entity4 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 were all photographed at the brand 's parties , pouting and sporting their @entity3 bags			1
@entity2 saw @entity3 as ' iconic and irreverent , warm and fuzzy '			1
the label was known for parties : its @entity133 show at @entity134 's had edgy young things spinning the decks			2
but occasionally their exuberance misfired			0
as @entity32 later recounted , the company 's 40th birthday party in @entity141 was such mayhem that the fashion press could n't get in and the police shut it down			2
it was youthful , jolly and a little wild			0
when @entity12 arrived , he was confronted with @entity2 and her ' @entity148 ' , as her colleagues were known			1
' luxury with a laugh ' did not appeal to the man from @entity91			0
he did n't appear to be in on the joke - or the business model @entity2 had created			1
for @entity12 did n't want @entity3 to be thought of as the bag that middle - income brits would buy as a present to themselves			1
he wanted a new , expensive tier to attract a new , more expensive customer			0
and he did n't want a celebrity - studded front row at their shows at all , fearing that the presence of @entity166 - let alone a @entity165 girl - might alienate as many customers as it brought in			2
celebrities can kill brands as quickly as they boost them			0
just ask @entity55 , which took years to recover from exposure by its low - rent celeb fans			0
@entity173 good : princess @entity174 ( here clutching a @entity3 bag ) has helped to make the brand a @entity36 institution @entity12 told @entity32 that 60 per cent of @entity3 's business was in @entity36			1
as ' the @entity36 is only 4 per cent of the luxury market worldwide ' , he believed that this left the brand vulnerable			0
' sometimes in your own market you can do things you ca n't do internationally			0
here they love you , you are iconic , but in @entity186 you are just one of many brands			0
' an @entity189 fashion editor told me that while the @entity36 all know @entity3 , it has barely any profile in @entity14 or @entity189			2
' @entity189 women do n't crave @entity3 bags			2
' intense , quirky @entity195 could make the label seem provincial abroad			0
and coming from extremely expensive , deliberately exclusive @entity91 , where the product - not the designer , let alone the customer - is the star , @entity12 was unlikely to embrace @entity3 's ambassadors pottering round @entity202			1
@entity12 wanted @entity3 to compete with @entity96 , @entity203 and @entity93			1
put simply , he and @entity204 wanted to make more money			0
so the prices went up			0
but bags that were a hit at under £ 700 - silly money , of course , but a price many @entity36 women would save up for - stopped selling when they went over £ 1,000			0
a series of profit warnings followed			0
as one fashion editor said : ' funnily enough , women who buy @entity3 do n't want to be thought of as women who spend crazy amounts on bags			2
so even those who could afford them were put off by the snootier pricing			0
' @entity223 has taken a dim view of @entity2 's departure			2
the response of @entity227 , managing director of luxury at investment company @entity229 , is typical : ' @entity3 is trying to reposition itself to the high end			1
mulberry in my view should be cheaper than @entity55 and @entity234			0
' there is little choice for handbags between £ 250 and £ 600			0
market results indicate that @entity3 's upmarket ambitions are facing hurdles			1
' in other words , @entity3 's price inflation is greed rather than good sense			1
no one thinks of it in the @entity203 or hermes league - its appeal is something else altogether - and many think it unlikely that it ever will			0
@entity3 's results today are forecast to see it report a 28 per cent drop in profits			1
and the share price that once reached £ 25 now stands at £ 9.40			0
' warm and fuzzy ' are no longer the buzzwords at @entity3			2
let 's hope a @entity186 snob has n't killed off the bags of fun .			0

@entity3 's creative director @entity2 has *resigned*
the fashion ' visionary ' transformed the brand into a major fashion player
but she 's had major disagreements with the new ceo @entity12
@entity12 wants to turn @entity3 into a high - end international brand
