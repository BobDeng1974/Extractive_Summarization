this is the astonishing moment a @entity2 man solved a @entity3 in just 21.17 seconds – while blindfolded			1
@entity4 set a new world record in the same amount of time that it takes most people to make a few turns and become frustrated with the @entity12 combination puzzle			2
but what makes it so remarkable is the fact that @entity4 accomplished his incredible feat without seeing what his hands were doing			2
@entity4 studies the @entity3 's cube to memorise its pattern for the world record attempt the speed cuber took a few seconds to memorise the pattern on the @entity3 and then , while blindfolded , he needed just a few more to solve it during a competition in @entity27 in western @entity2			1
a judge held a piece of paper between @entity4 's face and his hands to make sure he could n't peek under his mask			0
his celebration was subdued , however , as he jumped out of his chair and remained quiet out of respect for other competitors who were still trying to solve the puzzle			0
a judge holds a piece of paper between @entity4 's face and his hands to make sure he ca n't see the cube @entity4 leaps out of his chair and hugs the judge after solving the @entity3 in just 21.17 seconds this is n’t the first time @entity4 has set a world record with his special talent			1
he was already the record holder with a time of 23.19 seconds , which he set earlier this year			0
