by @entity0 published : 07:07 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 07:27 est , 5 september 2013 plans by the @entity2 to sell four of @entity4 's folios at auction , including a rare first edition , have been described by an expert as ' stupidity of the highest order '			1
academics fear if the sale goes ahead , the manuscripts , all of which were printed in the 17th century , will be snapped up by a private collector and will be moved overseas			1
only 232 of the first press , which dates back to 1623 , are believed to have survived intact			1
it contains the famous engraving of the @entity4 by @entity19			2
rare : an example of the @entity22 , printed in 1623			1
this edition contained the famous picture of the @entity4 , by @entity19 auction : the @entity2 's @entity26 ( left ) is about to put the rare works up for sale			1
@entity30 philanthropist sir @entity29 ( right ) bequeathed the library books when he died in 1958 the university hopes to raise about Â£ 5million when the folios go up for sale at auction house @entity35 , in november			0
the books were bequeathed to the university 's @entity26 by @entity30 philanthropist , sir @entity29 , when he died in 1958 , on the condition they were not sold later			0
because the library holds two copies of the first folio , which is regarded as being the most reliable , director @entity41 told @entity45 one could be sold because they are ' essentially duplicaties '			0
the claims drew derision from @entity4 expert and visiting professor at @entity50 , sir @entity51			2
he described it as ' rubbish ' , and pointed out no two books were the same because printing practices in the 17th century meant that every time a page was printed , the press would be stopped and corrections made			1
strong words : a detail of @entity63 's famous soliloquy from the 1623 first folio edition of @entity4 's plays			1
the book contains 36 plays , 18 of which had not been seen before historic : @entity4 's were not printed in their entirety until 1623			1
before then they had not been considered worthy enough he added : ' one of these copies may contain a correction that has puzzled people for many years and has never been solved			0
' so to sell them is an act of stupidity of the highest order			0
' the majority of the first folios have already moved overseas and in a letter to mr @entity41 , professor @entity85 , rector of @entity86 at the @entity87 , warned @entity88 would harm its reputation if it went ahead with the sale			0
he wrote : ' it will , i fear , make many who are supporters of the library and possible donors to it turn their charitable interests elsewhere			0
' the rationale for the sale is muddled and prompts questions about the current management of the collections			0
' the @entity4 : an early portrait of the @entity106 poet and playright , whose works are being put up for sale by the @entity2 to the horror of experts @entity112 in @entity4 at the @entity113 and trustee of the @entity115 , dr @entity116 , said : ' it 's deeply surprising that the library would sell books of this nature when they have been bequeathed as a permanent gift			1
' my view is that the key issue here is these books were intended as a permanent gift to the university 's library , and any sale could move the books to a private collection			2
' not being made available to the public is a really serious matter			0
' @entity88 plans to use the money raised through the sale to add to its collection by buying manuscripts from the 20th and 21st century , a plan described by @entity140 as a ' gamble '			2
he said : ' the sale would leave the library as @entity63 without the prince			0
' in his view the most likely fate for the rare editions would a ' very rich , private individual ' would make a move for them			2
a consultation on the plan began last week and the manuscripts are set to leave the country this month for a tour of cities in the @entity30			0
research : experts fear the folios will fall into the hands of a private collector preventing the public from accessing it			1
@entity165 , @entity166 , holds a rare @entity22 , in @entity167			2
