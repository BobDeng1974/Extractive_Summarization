by @entity0 being overweight can increase your risk of going deaf , researchers found			1
a 20 - year study of nearly 70,000 women found those who gained the most weight were more likely to lose their hearing			1
and although the study focused on women , the findings apply equally to men , the researchers said			1
until now , it was thought the only way to slow age - related deafness was to protect the ears against loud noise			0
but the study also found that regular physical activity – such as walking at least two hours a week – could reduce the risk of hearing loss by around 15 per cent			1
the study of 70,000 women found those who had put on more weight were more likely to lose their hearing			1
the findings are also applicable to men say researchers the findings come from the @entity27 , one of the biggest health research projects ever undertaken , which has been tracking the well - being of thousands of female nurses in the @entity32 since the 1980s			2
every two years for two decades the nurses were quizzed on health and lifestyle , including their dietary habits , weight and hearing loss			2
researchers from @entity40 in @entity41 found that very overweight women with a body mass index ( a measure of whether weight is healthy in relation to height ) of 40 or higher were 25 per cent more likely to have damaged hearing than women with a healthy @entity50 of 25 or lower			1
and women with waists bigger than 34.5in were 27 per cent per cent more likely to be hard of hearing than those with waistlines of less than 28in			1
the risks of obesity were evident even when researchers took account of other factors known to affect hearing , such as smoking			2
it ’s not clear exactly how being overweight damages delicate cells in the ear			0
the study found women with a @entity50 of over 40 were more likely to suffer damaged hearing			1
file image but the researchers , whose work is published in the @entity71 , suggested fatty deposits could clog up blood vessels in the ear , limiting blood supply and therefore damaging cells			2
a @entity32 study in the early nineties found elderly men and women with hearing loss were up to three times more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those whose hearing was still good			1
lead researcher dr @entity86 said : ‘ the ear is highly metabolically active , so that means it ’s really dependent on having adequate blood supply			0
’ she said obesity can compromise blood flow by narrowing blood vessels			0
people who are obese also are more likely to have high blood pressure , another condition that can hamper blood flow			0
around ten million people in the @entity99 suffer some degree of hearing loss and , as we all live longer , that figure is expected to rise to 14.5 million in the next 20 years			0
the vast majority of cases are due to the ageing process , where tiny hair cells in the inner ear die off and are not replaced			0
high - pitched sounds , such as a bird chirping or a phone ringing , are usually the first to go			0
according to the charity action on @entity114 , most people put up with deteriorating hearing for around ten years before having it tested or seeking help			0
action on @entity114 said it is due to publish its own research within the next few months exploring the links between dietary habits , smoking and loss of hearing .			0

study found women who gained most weight were more likely to lose hearing
the findings equally apply to men according to researchers
women with a @entity50 of 40 were 25 per cent more likely to have bad hearing
those with larger waistlines also were found to be more likely to go deaf
