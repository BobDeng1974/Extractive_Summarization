though winds raged to 70mph soon after it hit , they later died down to about 35 mph , leading forecasters to downgrade the storm to a tropical depression and cancel all warnings and watches less than 11 hours after it made land in southern @entity19 and northern @entity20			1
@entity21 and her daughters left their home in @entity24 , @entity25 , to head south for a @entity9 beach vacation â€” and ended up in the center of @entity4			2

here , strong waves batter @entity47 , @entity39 she skipped a graduation because powerful winds kept her and her daughters from venturing past the beach boardwalk when the storm approached on sunday			1
and she postponed their drive home monday as @entity57 , downgraded to a tropical depression , continued to dump rain near the @entity19 - @entity20 state line			1
' it definitely changed our vacation to unfortunate circumstances that we 're not happy with			0
but you just have to live with it , ' said @entity21 , who at least found the irony of her hometown 's name ' pretty funny			1
' beach lifeguards turned swimmers away from the ocean because of dangerous rip currents from @entity31 to @entity74 , @entity19 's largest public beach 140 miles to the north			1
@entity76 , who oversees the island 's lifeguards as its fire chief , said beach traffic was unusually thin for a holiday			2
the ocean was declared off - limits to swimmers for a second day in a row			2
' it 's been raining intermittently , so it 's chased a lot of them off , ' @entity76 said			2
' there was a lot of traffic this morning heading westbound out of @entity74			0
' veterans groups , meanwhile , carried out outdoor @entity9 ceremonies despite the grim forecast			0
at @entity98 's historic @entity97 , @entity96 members worked through a downpour to make sure its plot for veterans had a small @entity38 flag planted by each headstone			2
' when we were setting up , i had a different shirt on and i got soaked to the skin			0
my socks and my underwear probably are , too , ' said @entity111 , commander of @entity112 135 in @entity98			0
' i had so many people trying to talk me into moving it inside			0
but i said then you ca n't have the live firing salute and the flag raising			0
' aside from ruining holiday plans , the rain was welcome on the @entity19 coast for bringing some relief from persistent drought			1
according to the state climatologist 's office , as of may 1 , rainfall in @entity98 was 15 inches below normal for the past 12 months			2
emergency officials said minor flooding was reported near the coast , but the ground was quickly soaking up the water			2
and the winds had died down considerably			0
' we 've needed it for a long time , ' said @entity134 , emergency management director for coastal @entity136 south of @entity98 , who said the worst damage came by trees falling on two homes overnight			0
' we were lucky that we did n't get 3 to 4 inches in 30 minutes			0
most of it soaked right in before it had a chance to run off			0
it fell on an empty sponge			0
' the rainfall stopped in @entity98 and other northern parts of the @entity19 coast on monday afternoon , but more was expected through tuesday			1
a frontal system moving south from the @entity150 is expected to cause the storm do a u-turn and push it back out to sea			0

" i am encouraging all area residents to stay indoors and off the streets as the storm hits , " said @entity31 mayor @entity233			0
overcast : beachgoers stayed outside on sunday , even as @entity4 drew closer to shore and began to turn the weather sour forced out : these vacationers at @entity241 in @entity158 are likely to have their trips to the beach ruined when the storm makes landfall ' a three - day thunderstorm is what it 's probably going to be , ' said @entity248 , emergency management director for @entity249 , which is about 60 miles south of @entity98 and includes @entity250 and @entity225 in @entity19			1
' unfortunately , it 's going to ruin a lot of @entity9 plans			2
' @entity254 said he expects some flooded roadways and scattered power outages , perhaps some minor flooding in waterfront homes , but otherwise little damage			0
however , he urged beachgoers to beware of dangerous rip currents			0
computer forecast models show @entity57 moving on an eventual path back out over the @entity5 after coming ashore , posing no threat to @entity38 oil and gas installations in the @entity269			0
the storm is forecast to dump as much as 4 to 8 inches of rain , with as much as 12 inches in some areas , and threatens rip currents and possible coastal flooding , the hurricane center said			1
@entity57 formed off the @entity39 coast late on friday as a subtropical storm , a reference to the storm 's structure			1
