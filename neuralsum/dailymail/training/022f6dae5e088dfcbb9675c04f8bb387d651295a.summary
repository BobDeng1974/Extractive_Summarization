a new map has documented how many people eat what type of burger and where			0
food , drink and travel website @entity11 went through over 20 million check - ins on @entity16 , a location - based application that people use to register their whereabouts and leave tips for others			1
the winner ? @entity24 's , home of the @entity26			2
they are ranked in most popular to least in the key above winner : the most popular burger joint in the @entity1 , according to users of @entity16 , is @entity24 , home of the @entity26 @entity46 : this @entity48 - made outlet shows up strongest in the @entity49 @entity50 : a surprisingly low number for the home of the @entity53 , which proved most popular in @entity54 and @entity55 @entity56 's : most famous in its native @entity57 , alot of other @entity1 are now fans of the famous @entity61 @entity62 : just as @entity64 reigned supreme in the west , these double drive - thru restaurants get eaten up in the west , particularly @entity67 and @entity68 @entity64 : a major divide , this charbroiled burger chain fared increasingly popular in the west , but no love east of @entity71 and @entity72 dairy queen : while not specifically popular in one area			1
@entity73 did fairly well across the board , although surprisingly low in @entity67 and @entity71 the restaurant took the most amount of states - especially @entity79 , @entity80 , the @entity81 and @entity82 - but was also spread fairly well across the country			2
surprisingly the dominant franchises - @entity84 , @entity50 and @entity85 's - registered the lowest in popularity			1
however @entity11 contends these old favorites still are favorable			0
they just did n't show up on the @entity16 data because customers would be less - likely to check - in at one of the restaurants			1
the resultant map , while limited to just users of the app , is a good guide to seeing what burger is most - popular in each state by scanning through each			0

it was the 12th straight month of falling sales at the fast food giant			0
@entity105 : this ever - increasing chain has moved out of @entity107 and up into the @entity108 in - @entity109 : perhaps most famous @entity110 , in - @entity109 is actually most popular in @entity111 @entity112 : although concentrated in one area , @entity112 dominated in the southwest , especially @entity115 , where it 's from @entity117 : famous for their shakes , @entity117 turned up interestingly small numbers in @entity72 , its birthplace @entity122 : home of the @entity125 , this old favorite hits its prime in central @entity127 @entity85 's : even the bacon pretzel cheeseburger did n't get more people into @entity85 , however @entity11 contends that @entity16 users would be less likely to check - in to this popular chain @entity132 : @entity133 have a firm hold of their triple meat hamburgers and are n't letting it @entity136 : @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 - and @entity141 - love @entity136 @entity142 's : as with @entity50 and @entity85 's , @entity142 's did not register well on @entity16 , mostly because people would n't likely check - in at the @entity145			1
