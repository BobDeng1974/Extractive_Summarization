plan : @entity2 @entity1 will challenge @entity3 over migrants from @entity5 , telling him not to open @entity7 's borders on january 1 @entity2 mps will challenge @entity3 over @entity10 and @entity11 migrants today – urging him not to throw open @entity7 ’s borders from next year			1
backbench support is coalescing around a plan to extend restrictions on new arrivals from the two eastern @entity17 countries , due to expire on january 1 , for a further five years			1
dozens of @entity2 mps are likely to back the measure and put huge pressure on the prime minister to defy the @entity22 over its cherished free movement rules			1
the proposal will be heard by a committee of @entity1 today and could come before a full vote in the @entity27 within weeks			1
@entity28 , the mp for @entity29 in @entity30 , is spearheading the campaign			2
his proposed changes to the government ’s @entity33 currently passing through the @entity27 would extend restrictions until the end of december 2018			1
extending restrictions on migrant workers would provoke squeals of outrage – and likely legal challenge – from @entity42			2
but supporters say it would prevent huge pressure being placed on public services , including the @entity47 , and on jobs at a time when many @entity7 workers are struggling to find employment			0
it would also allow mr @entity3 to make a defiant stand over two crucial issues for his supporters – @entity5 and immigration – where he is seen to be leaking support to @entity58			0
last night mr @entity28 warned the economy ‘ can not cope ’ with another large influx of migrants			0
he said : ‘ the government is putting through a very worthwhile @entity33 which introduces a number of measures most people concerned about immigration will welcome			0
controls : @entity69 officials evict @entity10 migrants			1
in 2007 , when the country joined the @entity22 , ' transitional controls ' were applied which meant migrants must have a job offer in order to cross the border plan : @entity28 mp , pictured , proposes that restrictions are extended for five more years - until 2018			1
his plan will be heard by a committee of @entity1 today ‘ but what we do n’t have are any measures on @entity10 and @entity11 migrants , which is what people mention if you ask them about immigration			1
‘ quite rightly , people want to know what will happen from january			2
the unofficial forecast would mean a quarter of a million people coming here over the next five years			2
‘ people are quite rightly concerned about whether public services can cope , about what benefits they will claim and about the number of jobs they will take			0
’ there is no official estimate of possible new arrivals in the @entity7 when working restrictions are dropped for 29million @entity10 and @entity11 nationals , but migration campaigners predict it could be 50,000 a year			1
any movement of this order would decimate mr @entity3 ’s pledge to cut yearly net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ by 2015			0
currently that figure stands at 176,000 which is down from more than a quarter of a million in 2010 but still short of mr @entity3 ’s target			0
mr @entity28 pointed to 2004 when @entity115 ministers did not adopt temporary restrictions on migrant workers from @entity118 and seven other new @entity22 countries			2
more than a million migrants arrived in @entity7 despite official predictions that just 13,000 would come			0
a @entity123 spokesman said last night : ‘ this government has extended transitional controls to the maximum period of december 31			0
there is no power to extend them further as we are bound by the terms of the @entity132 negotiated by the previous government			2
‘ we are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between @entity22 member states and addressing the factors that drive @entity17 immigration to @entity7			0
‘ we are working to ensure our controls on accessing benefits and services are among the tightest in @entity5 to protect the @entity7 from abuse			0
’ eight out of ten newly qualified @entity11 doctors are planning to work abroad , a study has shown			1
in a questionnaire put to graduates from @entity11 ’s largest medical school in @entity149 , the majority said they planned to leave their country , with preferences for working in @entity7 and @entity153			1
one vascular surgeon told the @entity155 he could earn seven times more in the @entity7			0
but most @entity11 doctors cite their reason for wanting to move as being due to corruption concerns within their own health service .			1
