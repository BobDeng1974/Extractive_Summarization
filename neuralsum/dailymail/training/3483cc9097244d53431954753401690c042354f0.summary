a grade eight examination is a demanding test that requires musicians to perform a variety of tasks			2
these include showing their ability to complete scales , modes , arpeggios , chords and complete a stylistic study			0
they also have to perform a piece lasting three minutes 45 seconds , which has advanced stylistic techniques and use of stylistic sounds , with increasingly complex solo and improvisation opportunities included in it			0
a musician has to complete two listening tests where the student has to listen by ear for melodys and rhythms and then play it back			0
finally , they are quizzed on their general knowledge of music and their instrument			2
' that year she passed her grade one with distinction which was pretty good progress already			0
