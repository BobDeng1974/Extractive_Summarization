it 's always all about @entity1 at @entity2			1
it has been since the ethereal teenager imposed himself on the @entity6 consciousness in a @entity8 tie with @entity9 nine years ago			0
on tuesday he takes on @entity10 in the @entity11 and the questions surrounding him are frenzied as ever			2
should he have made a late - night visit to a casino with @entity15 and @entity16 24 hours after the 1 - 0 defeat by @entity18 ? why did he play so badly against @entity18 ? what is his relationship with manager @entity21 ? ( non-existent , say sources at @entity2 )			1
and , most importantly , will the ongoing tax inquiry into his financial affairs by the @entity26 authorities cause him to up and leave the club with which he has been synonymous ? @entity1 laughs as @entity2 train ahead of their @entity8 last - 16 clash with @entity10 @entity1 is the centre of attention as he walks towards the @entity11 pitch for training on monday evening @entity15 ( left ) and @entity34 ( right ) share a joke with @entity1 as @entity2 prepare that is the unspoken fear around the @entity37			1
this summer there are presidential elections at @entity2 and the candidate who is able to demonstrate that he has the backing of @entity1 and that the @entity42 will stay at the club is the candidate who will win a landslide			1
just as the coach who can demonstrate he is approved by @entity1 , will be the coach who takes over from @entity21			0
the current president , @entity47 , was forced to deny a report by a @entity50 tv station at the turn of the year that he and @entity1 had come to an agreement : give 100 per cent until the end of the season and then the club will replace @entity21 in the summer			2
and the 11 - game winning run which preceded the dire defeat by @entity18 at the weekend had done much to ease the tension which had bedevilled the club after @entity60			2
@entity21 would have probably been sacked had he lost to @entity61 in january but he won			0
and the recent run of form suddenly convinced some that three trophies might be looming , the @entity66 , @entity8 and @entity67			0
but one defeat is enough these days to allow onlookers to pick open old wounds and , short of winning the league or the @entity8 , those close to the club do n't expect @entity21 to survive the summer			2
and , it is acknowledged round the @entity37 , that in order to ensure @entity1 does n't decamp to @entity76 or @entity77 , the new coach and , if possible , the new president should have @entity1 's seal of approval			2
@entity2 boss @entity21 is under pressure to reach the @entity8 quarter - finals @entity1 looks dejected during @entity2 's home defeat on saturday - their first loss in 12 games it is not that his relationship with the club that is particularly bad but the ongoing tax case , with the @entity26 authorities pursuing him and his father for £ 3m tax on image rights deals , which is said to have irked him enough to consider leaving the country			1
@entity26 footballers and sports stars , including some of the heroes of the 2010 @entity98 win , have had similar tax issues , claim @entity1 's team			1
only the @entity42 is being pursued through the courts rather than being allowed to negotiate a settlement			0
aside from @entity1 , there are myriad problems at @entity2 at present which a new president will have to address			1
what is the club 's vision now and where is it heading ? into the arms of @entity118 money , whereby the @entity112 nation state sponsors not just the once - sacred team shirt but the name of the stadium as well ? the club which so bewitched and dominated @entity120 under @entity121 is no more			0
the world famous youth system , la cantera , has ceased to be the conveyor belt of world - class talent and the recruitment of foreign players to join it has resulted in a @entity130 transfer ban for 2015 ; the leaders of the great team , @entity133 and @entity134 , have retired or are feeling their age while @entity136 is at @entity137 ; and a club which had two managers in nine years under @entity140 and @entity121 , an era which saw them win three @entity8 trophies , have reverted back to type with three in three years			1
@entity2 last lifted the @entity8 under @entity121 after beating @entity137 in 2011 the @entity67 giants have had three managers in three years including @entity146 , who died in april last year @entity1 , pictured in action against @entity18 , will be hoping to return to form against @entity10 on tuesday they could hardly be blamed for failing to foresee the tragic death of @entity146 from cancer at the age of 45			1
but it appears that since he had to step down due his ill health in 2013 , the club has lacked any coherent strategy			1
or rather , the only strategy that does appear to dominate is : ' keep @entity1			0
' keep him happy and keep him at the club			0
in @entity159 they have been cheering themselves in the last 48 hours by saying no - one can remember when @entity1 last had two bad games in succession , the inference being that @entity10 will feel the backlash from saturday ' s anonymous performance it 's quite possible of course			1
no - one who watches football needs reminding of @entity1 's genius			0
prior to saturday night , everyone in barcelona - players , fans , journalists - were relaxed about facing @entity10 , expecting a comfortable win over the two legs			0
and that is still the most likely outcome			0
and should they win the major trophies at the end of the season , the lack of direction at the club over the past two years will doubtless be forgotten amidst the celebrations			0
but @entity187 are forging ahead in @entity67 at present and , if not @entity10 , then @entity187 , @entity188 or @entity9 all look capable of beating them in the @entity8			1
if that happens both @entity1 and a new president will have to answer the hardest question of all ; what does @entity2 stand for at the moment , other than keeping @entity1 happy ?			2
