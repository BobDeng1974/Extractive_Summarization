when @entity1 was told by doctors she needed a liver transplant she feared she would face a long wait for a donor organ			1
at an appointment with her doctor she mentioned in passing that she was a non-identical twin			1
it was a long shot , but he suggested her sister , @entity10 , be tested to see if she was a match			1
the results shocked the sisters - despite not looking the same and their mother telling them they were non-identical - the pair were in fact genetically identical			1
they have now become the first identical twins to undergo a live liver transplant in the @entity19			1
when @entity1 , left , was put on the transplant list she feared she would have to wait for a donor organ			1
but her non-identical twin @entity10 , right , was prepared to be tested to see if she was a match the results revealed the sisters , who had always believed they were non-identical because they do n't look the same , were in fact , genetically identical			1
@entity10 , left , donated part of her liver to her sister in the first live liver transplant between identical twins , carried out in the @entity19 ms @entity10 , 48 , said she did not think twice about donating part of her liver to her twin , when she became ill. she said it was an added bonus to discover , despite everything they had been told , that they were genetically identical			1
it meant ms @entity1 does not need to take a cocktail of drugs to stop her body rejecting the new organ			1
' i would just like to say thank you very much @entity10 , ' ms @entity1 said as she hugged her sister at @entity45 , in @entity46 , where the operation took place			1
' thank you from the bottom of my heart			1
' ms @entity1 's liver had been damaged by cancer a few years ago , prompting doctors to recommend she was added to the transplant list			1
she told her doctor she was a non-identical twin and he suggested doing tests			1
the results revealed the sisters , who live in @entity60 , near @entity46 , were genetically identical despite not looking exactly the same			1
' @entity61 always said that because there were two placentas when we were born , we were n't identical , ' said ms @entity10			1
' so we 've grown up believing we 're not identical because @entity1 's got a wider smile than me and she 's got a squarer face than me			1
@entity1 , second left , and @entity10 , second right , are pictured with consultant liver surgeons @entity70 , left and @entity72 , who performed the operation at @entity46 ' @entity74 ' we 've both got the silly same nose and i 'm a teeny , teeny bit taller than @entity1			1
so mum always said " you 're not identical "			2
' but they said you 're identical enough to do the transplant			1
' the sisters went through the operation in april and ms @entity1 said she is feeling much better			1
' i 'm feeling better by the day , ' she said			0
' it was a while ago and i still get tired but i ca n't thank everybody enough			2
' i walk round and nobody knows that i 've had a liver transplant			2
' ms @entity10 said : ' it 's nice to have @entity1 back to normal again			1
' consultant liver surgeon @entity70 , who did the operation , said live liver transplants - where the donor is a living person who donates a section of their organ for the operation - are getting more common			2
he said @entity45 's did their first one in 2007 and will do around 20 this year - around one in seven of all liver transplants			2
mr @entity70 said the main problem was putting the donor - an otherwise healthy person - through a major and potentially life - threatening operation			0
but he said it meant the ill person did not have to wait for an organ to become available from a dead donor			2
he added the benefits of identical twins having the operation was massive			2
he said it was even more so in the case of ms @entity1 as taking immuno - suppressant drugs would increase her risk of further cancer			1
mr @entity70 said : ' it 's an absolutely massive advantage which is @entity117 or nature 's gift			0
' genetics expert , dr @entity121 , a senior consultant in clinical genetics at @entity123 's in @entity124 said ms @entity1 and ms @entity10 's case is ' surprising but not unheard of '			1
he said non-identical twins are formed from two eggs , which are fertilised by two different sperm			2
' effectively they are siblings that just happen to be born in one womb at the same time , ' dr @entity121 told @entity133			2
' they are two completely different siblings born separately			0
' in the case of identical twins , one egg is fertilised by one sperm , creating an embryo that splits in two in the womb			2
the fact @entity10 and @entity1 were found to be genetically identical meant @entity1 did n't have to take anti-rejection drugs as her body accepted the new organ as if it was her own dr @entity121 said the twins ' mother 's justification that they had two placentas does not mean they were non-identical			1
if the embryo divides early on in the pregnancy , each baby will be grow within its own placenta			0
the later the split happens , the more likely it is identical twins will grow in one , single placenta			2
' the fact they had two placentas means the split happened early on			0
the later the embryo divides the less likely it is there will be two placentas , ' dr @entity121 said			0
once an embryo has split to create twins , there are a number of factors that will determine how each baby will look later in life			0
dr @entity121 told @entity133 : ' people naively perhaps , believe identical twins should be absolutely identical because they have the same genes			2
' but that assumes that every element that controls us is dictated by a coding sequence			0
' you have to view the coding sequence and the human body as a complicated orchestra of genes			0
' the way a piece of music is played can alter the sound you get			0
' let 's take a piece by @entity186 , two different orchestras will play the same piece differently			0
' there are different things that influence the expression of the same genes			0
genetics expert , dr @entity121 , a senior consultant in clinical genetics at @entity123 's in @entity124 said ms @entity1 and ms @entity10 's case is ' surprising but not unheard of '			1
he said many aspects will affect how identical twins look , and once an embryo has divided it is possible different gene mutations affect differing siblings ' epigenetics is the big thing everyone is talking about at the moment			0
the coating , layering or shielding on genes which can express now or later			0
' and then there are spontaneous mutations that occur			0
' of course where a single embryo splits in two a spontaneous mutation could occur in just one half of the divide			0
' if the mutation happens before the embryo splits , it will depend on which half the mutation ends up as to which baby will be affected by it			0
' yes , of course we should expect twins to have similar hair colour and facial features			0
' but there are also other issues that can affect visual appearance			0
' nutrition influences growth , the risk of cardiovascular disease , so why not how big a person 's nose is			0
' different placentas will mean different levels of nutrition			0
' there is also sometimes a situation known as blood stealing from one placenta to another which can alter things including growth rates			0
' yes , this is a surprising case but it is not unheard of			0

@entity1 was placed on the transplant list after cancer damaged her liver a few years ago
she told her doctor she was a non-identical twin and he suggested tests
the results showed @entity10 was genetically identical to her sister
surgeons performed the *groundbreaking* op at @entity46 ' @entity259
the fact the pair were genetically identical meant ms @entity1 did n't have to take anti-rejection drugs her body accepting the new organ as her own
she told her sister : ' thank you from the bottom of my heart '
