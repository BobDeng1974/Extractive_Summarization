by @entity1 reporter published : 18:14 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 02:13 est , 9 august 2013 the developer that bought @entity4 from the @entity5 in 2012 is renting it back to the corporation for £ 6.35million a year			1
the @entity5 finally left the building in march despite bitter opposition from many of its own stars , including @entity12 and comedian @entity13			2
it justified the move by claiming it would make a profit of £ 78million from the sale and save on running costs of £ 30million a year			1
old home : the @entity5 left @entity4 back in march to move to @entity20 costly : but it is leasing back the old building for £ 6.35million a year while it works to decommission it but bosses admitted yesterday it will continue to rent @entity4 for two years from the property firm @entity27 because it needs access to decommission the site and remove vital broadcasting equipment			1
last night critics said paying an extra £ 12.7million for a vacant property in @entity33 made little commercial sense and questioned why the @entity5 was also paying to clear up the site			1
@entity36 mp @entity35 said : ‘ i can not see why the @entity5 is paying £ 6million of licence fee - payers ’ money to a developer for an empty building , and at the same time paying the developer ’s clean - up costs			1
‘ this looks like another example of bad stewardship of public money by the @entity5			0
‘ it has been suggested to me that the @entity5 is being forced to sell and then rent back some of its properties to fill the financial black hole left by the construction of @entity20 , its lavish new central @entity51			0
’ new home : the @entity5 moved to @entity20 five miles away the @entity5 has already admitted it will rent back a ‘ significant part ’ of the 14 - acre site , even though it has spent more than £ 1billion revamping @entity20 just five miles away in @entity53			2
this was despite assurances when @entity4 was first put on the market in 2007			0
at the time , the @entity5 said : ‘ this is a full - scale disposal and we wo n’t be leasing it back			0
’ in fact , the @entity5 will pay £ 3.6million a year from 2015 to rent three studios			1
the cost will be covered by the @entity5 ’s commercial subsidiaries rather than from the licence fee			0
in addition , it will pay an estimated £ 60million removing broadcasting equipment , satellite aerials and circuits from @entity4 over the next two years			2
opposed : sir @entity12 , left , and @entity13 , right , were two of the television personalities fiercely opposed to the @entity5 move it is believed the high cost is driven by the difficulty of completing the move without disrupting normal tv service			2
the costs mean the @entity5 risks losing its overall profit on the sale			1
mr @entity35 added : ‘ the profit the @entity5 claims to have made on the sale of @entity4 will be all but wiped out by the costs of transferring and replacing equipment			1
‘ i suspect the @entity5 will end up making a loss once the amount paid by the developer is whittled down by such hidden costs			0
’ @entity27 paid £ 200million for a 999 - year lease on the site last july			0
it plans to develop a hotel , office space , leisure facilities and up to 1,000 apartments			0
a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ @entity4 is not empty			2
there is vital technology and equipment without which we could not broadcast			0
' the short - term cost of unavoidable decommissioning work is more than offset by the savings that moving will deliver			0
in addition to the profit on the sale , the @entity5 will save £ 30million a year on running the site			1

the @entity5 justified the move by claiming it would profit £ *78millionfrom* sale
it said that leaving @entity4 would save £ 30million a year in costs
critics have *slammed* paying £ 12.7million for a vacant building
