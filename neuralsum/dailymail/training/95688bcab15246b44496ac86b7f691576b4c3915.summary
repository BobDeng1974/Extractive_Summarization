size 10 model @entity0 has hit back at criticism over her newly released @entity4 underwear campaign after @entity6 users complained that she is not ' plus size '			1
talking to today , the 27 - year - old said it was ' unfortunate ' that @entity4 received flak for its ' groundbreaking ' perfectly fit ad campaign , which did n't actually point out her size at all			1
' they released this campaign with me right alongside all of the other girls of varying shapes and sizes , and did n't make a fuss about it , ' she explained			0
' i think it 's really unfortunate , because @entity4 has done something that 's really groundbreaking ... they released this campaign with what some would say is a normal - sized model , a size 10			1
and size 10 girls , there 's not a lot of spots for us to fit in in the fashion industry			1
after the campaign was released yesterday , @entity6 users criticized @entity4 on the basis of an @entity56 article in which @entity0 was referred to as ' what the fashion industry would -- still , surprisingly -- call " plus size " '			1
' it 's kind of confusing because i 'm a bigger girl , ' @entity62 , who stands at 5ft 11in , told @entity56			1
' i 'm not the biggest girl on the market but i 'm definitely bigger than all the girls [ @entity4 ] has ever worked with , so that is really intimidating			1
' @entity0 , who describes her body type as ' in the middle , ' looks stunning in the @entity73 campaign , flaunting her curves in a black bra , her brunette hair slicked back			1
she says the ad , which also features the more ' straight - sized ' @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , is revolutionary in that it does n't address that fact that she is the lone ' plus - size ' model in the group			2
' i 'm not skinny enough to be with the skinny girls and i 'm not large enough to be with the large girls , and i have n't been able to find my place , ' she explained			0
as such , ' this [ campaign ] was such a great feeling			0
' watch more of @entity0 's interview at @entity93 's @entity92 standing pretty : @entity0 shows off her curves in a photo from her agency @entity96 and yet some people took to @entity6 in outrage that she could even be considered a ' bigger ' girl			1
' @entity102 moment , ' one critic wrote in a tweet directed at @entity56			0
' this woman is described as " plus - size " and " a bigger girl "			1
another person said : ' i would n't consider her a plus size model			0
her height and her muscular tone should not categorize as a " big girl			0
" ' and a third commented angrily : ' how is that plus size ? ? ' despite the outcry , which seemed to be directed at @entity56 rather than @entity4 , @entity0 says landing the campaign has made her hopeful that size is becoming less of an issue in the fashion industry			1
up close : ' it 's kind of confusing because i 'm a bigger girl , ' says @entity0 , who stands at 5ft 11in			1
' i 'm not the biggest girl on the market but i 'm definitely bigger than all the girls [ @entity4 ] has ever worked with ' outcry : some critics have taken to @entity6 in outrage that she could even be considered a ' bigger ' girl in comparison : also featured in the campaign are @entity79 ( left ) and @entity77 ( right ) , who both fit the standard sample size ' it 's not like [ @entity4 ] released this campaign and were like , ' whoa , look , there 's this plus - size girl in our campaign , '' she explained			1
' they released me in this campaign with everyone else ; there 's no distinction			0
it 's not a separate section for plus - size girls			2
' a statement released by the fashion house expresses the same sentiment			0
' the @entity73 line was created to celebrate and cater to the needs of different women , ' a spokesperson told @entity154			0
' and these images are intended to communicate that our new line is more inclusive and available in several silhouettes in an extensive range of sizes			0
' @entity0 , who is currently signed by @entity96 after being scouted at 16 when she was crowned @entity161 , has opened up in the past about being encouraged to lose weight in order to fit into the ' standard ' modeling size			1
the model , who also works as a performance artist , has spoken in the past about her darkest days when she found herself heading down a path of drugs and eating disorders			0
fitting in : despite the controversy , @entity0 says landing the @entity4 campaign has made her hopeful that size is becoming less of an issue in the fashion industry she told @entity177 in 2012 : ' i tried for a long time to make myself [ lose weight ]			1
i tried throwing up after i ate and that 's awful			0
that is painful - i would never wish for anyone to do that ever			0
' the model revealed that she would spend weeks eating nothing but calorie - free black olives and pickles and spending hours in the gym to try to slim down to a more typical model weight			0
she then gave up modelling for two years to concentrate on her studies but it was @entity196 who paved the way for her return as a plus - size girl			2
@entity0 said : ' they told me about plus modeling which was something i 'd never heard of before			2
in the middle : ' i 'm not skinny enough to be with the skinny girls and i 'm not large enough to be with the large girls ... ' this [ campaign ] was such a great feeling ' , explained @entity0 ( with model @entity210 ) ' but then they [ scouts @entity212 and @entity214 ] showed me , and this is when @entity196 was really starting to pick up speed , so i walked into @entity217 and the first thing @entity219 [ @entity220 ] said to me was , " you 're the next @entity196 , " and then they signed me			2
' but @entity0 has also noted that she is encouraged to have landed the @entity4 campaign , despite not fitting into the super-skinny mold			2
' look at the history of the brand , they launched @entity227 , and this is the woman who started this whole trend of waif , ' she told @entity232 earlier this year			0
' to see a brand like that embracing a greater range of sizes â€¦ it 's really special			0
' flashback : @entity4 has previously attracted ire for championing the ' heroin chic ' waifish look as exemplified by @entity227 in a 1992 ad ( pictured )			2

@entity0 is 5ft 11in and a @entity39 size 10 , which is a @entity48 size 14
said she 's ' definitely bigger than any girl @entity4 has ever worked with '
the 27 - year - old from @entity161 describes her body type as ' in the middle '
@entity6 users have expressed outrage she could be considered a ' bigger ' girl
