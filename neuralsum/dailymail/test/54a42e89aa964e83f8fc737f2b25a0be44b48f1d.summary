' with no trees to speak of , trees by a springs would have been real respite , ' mrs @entity77 told the @entity82			2
referring to @entity7 itself , which likely began its life as a town in the late 1870s , she added : ' by 1910 , there was not much left			0
' indeed , the town once boasted a ranch house and a commissary building after four ranchers moved to the area in the 1870s and early 1880s			1
the men , named as @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , set up an enormous cattle ranch in the region after an @entity102 order banned @entity104 cattle drives from crossing the @entity105 , according to the book , @entity9 : the @entity108 , by author @entity107			2
the operation , dubbed the @entity110 , which was based at @entity95 's ranch , began with 26,000 head of cattle			0

however , in 1884 , a large portion of @entity8 - where the ranchers had used land ' unofficially ' - was bought by settlers for $ 1.25 an acre			0
in following years , as the herd law was enacted ( forcing ranchers to fence their cattle ) and the winters became harsher , the @entity110 dissolved			0
but @entity7 continued to grow , @entity170 , of @entity171 , writes in his and co-author @entity173 's book , @entity174			0
a nearby post office moved into the town , a sorghum mill reportedly opened and by november 1886 , residents were hoping for a railroad			2
' we all want a railroad and now is the time to get one , ' the editor of @entity181 apparently wrote at the time , adding : ' we may never have a better chance			0
' however , several years later , the newspaper had shut down due to lack of profit , while the commissary building and its post office shortly closed			2
sawed logs : the historic commissary building was built using rough sawed logs and wood that workers notched to fit ( pictured today ) co-manager : mrs @entity197 is pictured looking up inside the commissary			0
she now manages @entity199 in the town with her husband today , horse harnesses hang empty from the roof of the building 's ruined stables , while the commissary 's wooden log structures are falling apart			0
in front of the building , broken - off posts stick up from the ground - and a boardwalk that used to be bustling with residents is long gone			0
' i 'd love to have someone restore it , ' mrs @entity77 said of the commissary , adding : ' it would be expensive			1
i should have done it 20 years ago			0
' mr @entity17 moved to @entity7 with his parents in the 1940s to manage @entity199 - long after the town had been deserted by most ranchers			2
