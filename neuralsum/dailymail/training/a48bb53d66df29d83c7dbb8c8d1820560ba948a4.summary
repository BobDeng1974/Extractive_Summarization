it is just a joke			2

i could n't imagine in my wildest dreams that anyone would think “ he is going to come and drown me like a witch ”			1
‘ the whole witch thing is obviously satirical , it is not cynical like the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) are claiming			1
i do n't see that message as being menacing or offensive			1
‘ it is just humour , nothing more than that			0
