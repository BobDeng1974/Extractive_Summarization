manager @entity45 has completed a free transfer deal for experienced midfielder @entity48 , 31 , but is also looking to add more flair to his @entity49 squad			1
impressed by the success of @entity56 's loan spell at @entity57 , @entity45 has gone to his former club @entity46 to ask about 18 - year - old @entity47 , who was one of the young stars to shine at the @entity60 and last year 's @entity61			1

from @entity22 to @entity8 : @entity49 defender @entity85 ( left ) joined from @entity46 last year @entity88 move for @entity89 may stall any proposed move for @entity89 at @entity88 may stall as the club assesses the profile of player they are chasing			1

staying put : @entity46 have no desire to sell @entity17 international @entity122 ( right ) despite interest from @entity118 @entity142 told @entity143 he intended to join @entity118 at the end of the season and the hitch has been @entity147 moving to @entity148			1
