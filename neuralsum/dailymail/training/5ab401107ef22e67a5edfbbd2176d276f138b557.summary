millions around the world watched @entity11 , 34 , ' waving his hands aimlessly ' next to @entity13 at tuesday 's ceremony as he pretended to interpret the @entity17 president 's tribute to @entity2 for deaf viewers			1
now , days after it was claimed he has faced charges for murder , rape and kidnapping , the four sources said he was part of a vigilante execution squad who placed tyres around their victims ' necks and set them ablaze - a horrific practice known as ' necklacing '			1
unlike two other suspects who went to trial in 2006 for the killings , the four said on monday that @entity11 never did because authorities determined he was mentally unfit			1
they say @entity11 was institutionalized and then returned to his neighborhood on the outskirts of @entity59			1
the accusations come days after it was claimed he has faced charges for murder , rape and kidnapping			2
necklacing : ' @entity66 ' is the practice of forcing a tyre filled with petrol over victim 's head and shoulders and setting it alight			1
this suspected police informant , in @entity75 , @entity56 , was saved in 1985 by clergy before the tire could be lit. in the upper right corner , a book of matches can be seen claims : @entity80 , a deaf @entity56 and board member of the @entity81 , claimed the man was simply making up his own signs @entity56 news website @entity84 reported that mr @entity11 , who has schizophrenia , has faced charges for rape ( 1994 ) , theft ( 1995 ) , housebreaking ( 1997 ) , malicious damage to property ( 1998 ) , murder , attempted murder and kidnapping ( 2003 ) charges			1
' @entity66 ' is the practice of forcing a tyre filled with petrol over victim 's head and shoulders and setting it alight			1
it can often take a victim more than 20 minutes to die in excruciating agony			2
in the violent 1980s and 1990s , necklacing was a common sentence imposed by ' people 's courts ' on collaborators with the apartheid regime and criminals in @entity56			2
it was frequently carried out in the name of the @entity112 and was alleged to have been endorsed by @entity2 's then wife , @entity113			2
the @entity112 says it never condoned necklacing			0
in 1986 mrs @entity115 , caused controversy when she stated : ' with our boxes of matches and our necklaces we shall liberate this country			0
' the statement , which was widely seen as an implicit endorsement of necklacing , caused the @entity112 to briefly try to distance itself from her			0
it is still used in certain , more lawless , parts of @entity56 , where corrupt police are no longer trusted , to punish thieves and rapists			0
incidents have been reported more recently in @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			0

it also reported that many of the charges brought against him were dropped , allegedly because he was mentally unfit to stand trial			1
mr @entity11 was acquitted on the rape charge , but he was convicted of theft for which he was sentenced to three years in prison			1
the channel could not ascertain if he served the jail time			0
@entity155 has contacted the @entity156 for a comment on the claims			0
mr @entity11 was yesterday approached by a reporter for the @entity160 who asked him about the criminal charges , but he refused to comment			2
the news is a further embarrassment to @entity56 officials as it was revealed that mr @entity11 had faked sign language at the memorial event			1
@entity169 users with sign language knowledge claimed the interpreter repeatedly used signs for ' donkey ' , ' lightning bolt ' and ' prawns '			0
@entity176 meanwhile has reported trained sign language trainers as saying he also made reference to ' rocking horses '			0
@entity80 , a deaf @entity56 and board member of the @entity81 , has said he believed the interpreter was making up signs as he went along			0
last week , mr @entity11 explained the embarrassment by claiming he may have suffered a schizophrenic episode on stage and that he saw ' angels ' at the event			1
he said that his hallucinations began while he was interpreting and that he tried not to panic because there were ' armed policemen around me			0
