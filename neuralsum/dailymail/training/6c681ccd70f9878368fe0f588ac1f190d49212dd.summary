senior @entity0 rallied round @entity1 last night after she revealed she has been diagnosed with a form of diabetes that will require daily injections for the rest of her life			1
the home secretary said it had been ‘ a real shock ’ when she was told last november that she had type 1 diabetes , which carries an increased risk of heart attack and strokes			1
@entity0 colleagues praised her courage for speaking out on the issue , and said it would make no difference to her work – or her rumoured ambition to stand for the @entity0 leadership one day			1
two stone lighter : @entity1 arrives at the @entity24 ceremony at @entity25 in central @entity26 in june 2010 ( left ) , and is pictured ( right ) at her home in @entity28 last week former @entity0 treasurer @entity29 said the illness ‘ will not hold her back ’ and revealed that he is also a sufferer			1
in the message on @entity33 he said : ‘ diabetes will not hold @entity1 back			1
it did n’t for me and should n’t for her			2
’ mrs may , 56 , said she had spoken out following speculation about her rapid weight loss in recent months – which some observers had claimed was the start of a makeover campaign to prepare for a possible future leadership bid			1
in february this year the @entity45 mp @entity44 , chairman of the @entity47 home affairs committee , tweeted : ‘ a bit worried about home secretary			2
she is looking a bit thin these days			2
a new diet or pressure of work ? ’ in an interview with the @entity55 yesterday mrs may admitted she ‘ was n’t best pleased ’ with mr @entity44 ’s ‘ unfortunate ’ intervention			2
she added : ‘ i thought it actually rebounded on him rather than anything to do with me			2
support : former @entity0 treasurer @entity29 ( pictured in 2010 ) said the illness ' will not hold her back ' and revealed that he is also a sufferer ‘ i thought it was unfortunate that he felt he wanted to make those sorts of comments			1
he does have diabetes , he ’s mentioned it in @entity69 , so i will be interested to see what the next thing he chooses to say will be			1
’ fashion statement : a 2011 choice by mrs may at the @entity75 in @entity76 the home secretary ’s illness could mean the end of the most famous heels at @entity81			2
mrs may is renowned for her love of shoes – particularly of all things leopard print – and her often - daring outfits are always smartly accessorised by killer heels			2
but diabetes causes high blood sugar levels which encourage bacteria , so that any minor cut or blister can quickly become infected and develop into an ulcer – and the feet are particularly vulnerable			1
some doctors advise patients not to wear overly high heels or pointed shoes as this puts undue pressure on the feet			0
instead they are encouraged to wear comfortable shoes preferably with cotton socks to help cushion the impact			0
but mrs may is adamant her signature sling - backs will not get the boot			0
she told the @entity55 : ‘ i have to say the advice [ doctors ] give on shoes does not necessarily include kitten heels			0
i ’ve not been banned from wearing them			0
’ her love of footwear emerged at the @entity0 conference in @entity114 in 2002 when her £ 110 @entity116 ponyskin kitten heels caused a sensation			1
but one pair should n’t cause too much of a problem – the leopard print wellies she wore to the conference in 2009			0
mrs may explained that she embarked on her diet and fitness regime before discovering she had diabetes , which can also cause weight loss			1
she has lost almost two stone in the last 18 months , shrinking down to between a size ten and a 12			0
the home secretary , the bookmakers ’ favourite to succeed @entity131 as @entity0 leader , was initially told she had type 2 diabetes , like 90 per cent of all three million adults in the @entity135 with diabetes			1
however further tests revealed it was actually @entity139 , which is more usually diagnosed in teenagers and which leaves patients with a greater risk of strokes and heart disease			1
the revelation comes at a time when mrs may ’s popularity within the @entity0 parliamentary party is at a high , following the successful deportation of hate preacher @entity151 and the first signs of success in bringing down immigration			1
but she put paid to rumours that her weight loss was a sign of a planned leadership bid			1
‘ this was not some great machiavellian plan , because there is no leadership bid , ’ she said			0
‘ we have a first - class leader and a first - class prime minister and long may he continue			0
’ @entity0 @entity166 yesterday said the illness would make no difference to mrs may ’s ambitions			1
@entity170 , a member of the home affairs committee , said : ‘ there is no reason why it should get in the way of the great job she is doing			0
it is good that she is being open about it as it will help raise awareness			0
’ fellow @entity0 @entity182 said : ‘ it must be a shock and it will have to be managed			1
my message would be – now carry on being a top home secretary			0
’ mrs may also insisted the illness , which requires her to administer twice - daily injections to herself , would not affect her ability to carry out her gruelling workload			0
‘ the diabetes does n’t affect how i do the job or what i do , ’ she said			1
‘ it ’s just part of life , so it ’s head down and get on with it			0
’ she went on : ‘ it was a real shock and , yes , it took me a while to come to terms with it			0
i ’m a little more careful about what i eat			0
and there ’s obviously the injections , but this is something millions of people have			0
i ’m ok with needles , fortunately			0
‘ there ’s a great quote from @entity212 who was diagnosed with diabetes before he won his last olympic gold medal			2
he said diabetes must learn to live with me rather than me live with diabetes			2

her type 1 diabetes carries an increased risk of heart attack and strokes
