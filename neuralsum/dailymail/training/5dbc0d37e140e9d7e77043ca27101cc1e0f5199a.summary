by @entity0 published : 23:41 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 06:56 est , 16 january 2013 twenty years after she was chained as a prisoner in a coffin - sized box , @entity1 says the ordeal she suffered as a 10 - year - old was ' the best thing that happened to me ' because it allowed her to escape a life of abuse			1
on the 20th anniversary of her ordeal , @entity14 has co-written a book with a television reporter who covered her kidnapping			1
' buried memories : @entity14 ' ( @entity22 ) has a happy ending			2
telling her story : on the 20th anniversary of her ordeal , @entity1 has co-written a book with a television reporter who covered her kidnapping dungeon : a crane raises a 6 foot by 9 foot bunker out of the earth at the property of @entity34 in this january 18 , 1993 file photo @entity14 is now a 30 - year - old married mother of two who earned a degree in business management and works in insurance sales near her home in rural @entity42			1
her kidnapping attracted nationwide attention in early 1993 , when revelations surfaced while she was still missing that she had suffered years of neglect from her mother and had been repeatedly sexually assaulted by her godmother 's husband since she was a toddler			1
@entity14 was described in dickensian terms back then - a louse - infested , filthy waif who had no friends and often was forced to lug the family 's laundry down the block or fetch cigarettes and junk food for her elders			1
after kidnapper @entity34 , a family acquaintance , admitted to detectives on january 13 , 1993 , that he had kidnapped @entity14 and showed them the dungeon where she was hidden for 17 days under his @entity63 , @entity64 , home , the little girl was placed in foster care and raised in a comfortable @entity66 home with four siblings			1
her foster parents not only imposed newfound discipline into her life , making her go to school regularly and do small chores around the house , but they also shielded @entity14 from intense media interest			2
and reporters largely complied with a parent - like plea from a prosecutor to leave her alone			0
now : @entity1 is a 30 - year - old married mother - of - two and has finally decided to speak about her ordeal in her book buried memoirs then : @entity84 vanished one day before her tenth birthday and was kept chained in an underground dungeon by @entity34 , a friend of @entity84 's family ' we as a society must protect this child , or our professed love for own children is just a fraud , and our so - called compassion for each other is just a mockery , ' said @entity97 , who was the @entity98 district attorney at the time			1
so @entity14 had barely been seen or heard from since until this week in a media blitz to promote the book			1
she appeared on the @entity103 show monday and is the focus of a people magazine feature this week			0
ordeal : in the book , @entity107 writes that she had been molested and raped by her godmother 's husband from the time she was a toddler the abduction and subsequent rescue saved her life , @entity107 said in an interview with the @entity0			1
' the best thing that happened to me , ' she said			0
' i would have never gotten out of the abuse situation i was in			2
' she went on to play volleyball at @entity122 , participated in drama productions and went to college in @entity42 , where she earned a degree and met the man who would become her husband and the father of their two children			2
' there 's no point really in me right now being sad or wondering what if , ' she told the @entity0 ' i try not to be sad about what happened , because ultimately it made me who i am today , and i 'm very satisfied and happy with my life , ' she said			2
@entity14 agreed about four years ago to co-write the book with @entity142 reporter @entity141 , although she had thought about writing a book for many years			1
' i want to be able to help people who might not know where to turn , ' she explained			0
' to see that there is a road to recovery			0
' she has declined to disclose her exact hometown , married surname or college alma mater , citing privacy concerns for her family			0
in the book , @entity107 writes that she had been molested and raped by @entity157 - her godmother 's husband - from the time she was a toddler			1
@entity157 , who served 12 years in prison for molesting @entity14 , died in jail in 2009 following his arrest on a parole violation			2
@entity14 also writes that @entity165 raped her in the dungeon , explaining that she repressed her memory of the sexual assault for many years as a defense mechanism			1
dungeon : @entity165 finally confessed to police that he abducted @entity84 and led them to the underground bunker , which was hidden by a 200lb concrete wall built underneath his @entity176 home @entity165 , who pleaded guilty to kidnapping , was never charged with rape			2
he is serving 15 years to life and has been denied parole several times ; his next parole hearing is later this year			0
at a 2007 parole hearing , @entity165 described himself as asexual and said while he kissed the child , he never engaged in sexual relations			0
he told @entity141 in a letter published in the book that he believes he deserves to be released			2
' i think @entity84 knows i will always wish her well , ' @entity165 writes			0
' i 'm sorry for what i 've done			0
i 'm sorry i even thought it up			0
' during her time in the dungeon , @entity107 writes , she rarely slept , fearing abuse from @entity165			1
she said she was afraid @entity165 might molest her while she slept , but also was concerned that he would photograph her sleeping and send the image to police			0
breaking her silence : @entity84 , pictured during an interview on monday , was found in 1993 after 17 days held captive in a neighbor 's dungeon - like bunker she feared if police thought she was dead , they might stop looking for her			1
she ' celebrated ' her 10th birthday while a prisoner of @entity165 's and was heard on an audiotape found in the dungeon after her release singing ' @entity211 ' to herself , although she says today she has no recollection of that			0
@entity165 , she writes , fed her primarily junk food and soda ; to this day she is repulsed by chocolate after - dinner mints because they were a staple in captivity			0
she did have access to a small television , but says she can no longer listen to @entity224 's version of ' @entity225 ' because it played incessantly on @entity227 and @entity228 while she in the dungeon			0
she did n't realize it until many years later , but says now that she frequently watched @entity141 - then a reporter for @entity176 's @entity233 cable station - filing reports on the police search for her while she was missing			2
' it was like i had known her for 16 years ' when they met in 2008 to begin work on the book , she said			0
@entity84 has never spoken publicly about her ordeal at the hands of @entity165 , left , in an attempt to live a ' normal ' life but has now opened up in her book , buried memories , right @entity141 notes that as abhorrent as @entity14 ' sexual abuse and neglect was at the hands of her elders before the kidnapping , it may have steeled her into a survival mode			1
@entity253 , the @entity98 detective who led the investigation , agreed , telling @entity141 in the book that ' because of her upbringing , the sexual experiences , the abuse , and street smarts and toughness , she was much more advanced than the normal 9 - year - old , and we believe that contributed to her survival			2
' @entity107 , who is described in the book as a hard - working but largely absentee mother who ceded responsibility for raising @entity84 and her older brother to @entity157 's wife and others , did not return a telephone message seeking comment about the book			1
' i hope that more does come out of the book , ' @entity1 said			1
' i would love to be able to help other kids or adults or to be an inspirational or motivational speaker , something like that			0
but if i go back to my life in rural @entity42 and go back to my insurance sales job i would love that , too			0
' i 'm very happy with where i 'm at			0
' neglect : @entity107 , mother of 10 - year - old @entity1 , often left her daughter with her godmother and husband - who sexually abused and raped her for years underground : even though police were at @entity34 's home after @entity84 vanished , the bunker was so hidden , they had no idea it even existed and did not hear @entity84 's screams for help			1

@entity1 , now 30 , was held captive for 17 days in a widely publicized case
on the 20th anniversary of the *infamous* kidnapping , @entity14 has *co-authored* a book with a tv reporter who covered the case
in @entity306 , @entity107 writes that she suffered abuse by her godmother 's husband before the abduction
