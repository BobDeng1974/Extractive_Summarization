hours from death with a brain tumour , @entity0 went on a rollercoaster ride â€“ and it saved her life			2
the schoolgirl had no idea of the danger she was in when she visited a theme park days before a hospital appointment to discover why she was suffering bad headaches and dizziness			0
but when she finally saw the doctors , they told her she had a tumour so big it had stopped vital fluid moving around her brain			1
the rollercoaster had relieved the build up of pressure by briefly redistributing this liquid			2
survivor : @entity0 was hours from death when she was diagnosed with a huge brain tumour at 12 - but has now made an incredible recovery this had bought her precious extra days , and she was able to undergo an operation the next day			1
even so , doctors warned her that this could leave her in a vegetative state			1
but eight years on , miss @entity0 has stunned them all by making a complete recovery			0
she has learned to walk and talk all over again , and is about to begin a career as a primary school teacher			2
miss @entity0 was 12 when she started to feel unwell and was referred to hospital for tests			2
the weekend before the appointment , her mother @entity35 took her and a group of friends to @entity39 , where she rode on the @entity41 rollercoaster			1
life - threatening surgery : doctors at @entity44 in @entity45 told @entity0 's parents the tumour had been growing in her brain since she was five at the time she had a satsuma - sized tumour blocking the flow of cerebrospinal liquid in her brain			1
doctors later said the tumour had been growing since she was six and she had just hours to live when she went on the ride			0
miss @entity0 , now 20 , from @entity55 in west @entity56 , said : ' it was such a shock to discover i 'd had this tumour growing inside me , probably for years , without me knowing anything about it			0
brain scan : the tumour has grown to the size of a satsuma - and was so advanced that young @entity0 was just hours from death ' the doctors told my parents that i would need 24 - hour care , because the tumour was wrapped about my brain stem , and the surgeons thought removing it would cause irreparable damage			1
' after the operation , i could n't walk , talk , or even feed myself			2
but i was determined i 'd walk again and beat the tumour			0
it has taken years of hard work , but now , i 'm finally able to do the things i 've always wanted to and live the life i 've always wanted to lead			0
at my latest scan , there was no sign of the tumour returning , so it 's great news			0
' miss @entity0 has had numerous operations over the past eight years , spending a year with her leg in a splint , then two years walking with a crutch			0
long journey : miss @entity0 had to relearn how to walk , talk and eat after the surgery - which doctors feared could leave her in a vegetative state lucky to be alive : miss @entity0 is now training to be a primary school teacher and campaigning to raise awareness about the early signs of brain tumours the @entity41 at @entity39 , which @entity0 rode and which may have saved her life she then had to have special soles put into her shoes to support her walking			1
but now the only sign of the tumour is a slight paralysis on the left side of her face			0
she said : ' i have had so much hydrotherapy , physiotherapy and speech therapy to get me where i am today			0
the doctors thought i might make slight improvements after my operation , but they have since told me they never expected me to come anywhere near as far as i have			1
' miss @entity0 has now teamed up with the @entity115 to champion their @entity118 campaign , which aims to raise awareness of how to spot the early signs of a brain tumour .			1
