if @entity1 really believes what he said after @entity4 's miserable @entity3 ended with an anti-climactic win over @entity6 at a near - empty @entity7 , then they are in even more trouble than we thought			1
the @entity4 one - day captain was either protecting his players or is in total denial after an early @entity3 exit caused by @entity4 's extreme limitations in the 50 - over format being repeatedly , brutally and embarrassingly exposed			1
it is the only explanation for @entity1 insisting he had ' no regrets ' and , even more bizarrely , saying that he felt all the @entity4 players who have under - performed so spectacularly here should carry on in the one - day blue clothing			1
@entity4 captain @entity1 insists he and his side have ' no regrets ' over their early @entity3 exit @entity1 ( second left ) walks off the field with @entity25 ( third left ) as rain delays play on friday this was another deflating day for @entity4 even if they did win their final , meaningless group match with ease on a soggy day in @entity7 against a willing but mediocre team of minnows in @entity6			1
it was a game that was hardly worth playing and one that even the 9,000 present would have been happy to see rained off so that they could watch the far more entertaining @entity37 win over @entity38 on tv			0
the statistics , if we dare bring those up , will tell you that @entity4 were businesslike in restricting @entity6 to 111 for seven off 36.2 overs before knocking off their revised target of 101 in 25 overs with 41 balls to spare			2
but then came another strange press conference from a captain who has been a massive disappointment since taking over from @entity51 on the eve of this tournament , not least with the bat			0
@entity4 batsman @entity55 plays a shot as @entity6 wicket - keeper @entity57 watches on @entity25 shakes hands with @entity6 players following @entity4 's hollow consolation win at the @entity3 ' there are no regrets , absolutely not			1
we gave it everything , ' @entity1 insisted after @entity4 had managed to equal statistically their worst ever @entity3 by defeating a second minnow in @entity6 as well as @entity67			1
only in 1996 have they had such a shocker , on that occasion beating just @entity70 and the @entity71			0
then came the bombshell that a team who have failed dismally to come anywhere close to the pace being set by the leading nations in this tournament should all carry on towards the @entity78			0
when @entity1 was asked if @entity4 should make changes as they play catch - up in one - day cricket , he said : ' no , absolutely not			1
we have n't got guys who are coming towards the end of their careers			0
i do n't see any reason why any of them should retire			0
i think we have the right calibre of squad			0
guys on the outside need to be banging down the door			0
it 's an easy thing to sit here while we 're not doing well and say someone outside the squad is better			2
we considered everybody when we selected the squad and i still believe we had the right group of players here			0
' @entity25 plays a shot during @entity4 's match against @entity6 at the @entity7 @entity55 ( left ) and @entity1 celebrate the wicket of @entity6 's @entity103 during friday 's win @entity4 batsman @entity105 plays a shot during the final match of @entity4 's poor @entity3 campaign that may be so but if the time is not ripe for change now , then we may as well all give up on the 50 - over format and go home			1
for instance , @entity25 made an unbeaten 52 yesterday in his 161st one - day international but surely that must be his final appearance in a one - day shirt , whether he retires or is dropped			0
also , there seems no point in either @entity120 or @entity121 slogging away in one - day cricket for little reward when there is the small matter of 17 @entity126 coming up in 10 months , starting with a tour of the @entity128 there is the position of the captain himself , who said he was ' hungry ' to carry on at the helm			0
yet @entity1 is not hungry enough , it seems , to lead @entity4 in their next one - day international , against @entity136 in @entity137 in may			1
instead he will be at the @entity138 even though the coach of his @entity141 team , @entity142 , has intimated that @entity1 is a squad player and is likely to remain on the bench rather than in the action			2
the bottom line is that @entity4 should have been heading to @entity146 today for a @entity3 quarter - final against an @entity149 team they defeated twice in the tri-series here before their world fell apart			2
they could even have won that and reached the semi-finals , and from there who knows what might have happened			0
what a reality check for @entity160 one - day cricket			2
and if @entity1 truly believes that no changes need to be made now , then he is the wrong man to take @entity4 forward after this disaster of a @entity3			1
@entity4 's win over @entity6 attracted only a handful of supporters to conclude a dismal @entity3 despite their early exit the @entity3 , @entity1 suggests @entity4 should stick with the current squad			1

@entity1 says he has ' no regrets ' over @entity4 's woeful @entity3 exit
the win against @entity6 was a sorry consolation for a poor tournament
@entity4 's low - key *victory* was played in front of a half - empty *stadium*
but @entity1 believes @entity4 should persist with the current squad
his *defiant* comments are certainly cause for concern for @entity160 cricket
