rep. @entity0 got in hot water tuesday when his argument against a rape exception in a bill limiting access to abortion was compared to campaign - ending comments last august from @entity10 @entity9 candidate @entity8 congressman @entity0 , an @entity12 @entity11 who is advocating for a bill that would ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy , putting back on the front burner an embarrassing episode from the 2012 election season			1
a @entity10 @entity11 @entity9 candidate lost the female vote by 22 percentage points last year after claiming in august that the human body naturally protects victims of ' legitimate rape ' from becoming pregnant			1
@entity0 similarly dismissed on tuesday the idea that women who have been raped should be permitted to terminate their pregnancies whenever they choose			2
he recalled past debates ' when my friends on the left side of the aisle here tried to make rape and incest the subject			0
' ' because , you know , the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low			1
' ' but when you make that exception , there ’s usually a requirement to report the rape within 48 hours			2
and in this case that ’s impossible because this is in the sixth month of gestation			0
' @entity8 , a former congressman who lost his bid to unseat @entity10 @entity53 sen. @entity52 in a landslide in november , faced national condemnation - and was abandoned by the @entity56 - after saying that ‘ if it ’s a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to shut that whole thing down			1
’ @entity8 later tried to walk his statement back , clarifying that by ' legitimate rape , ' he meant to focus on cases where women have made false claims about being sexually assaulted			1
@entity11 @entity9 candidate @entity8 's campaign came to an ignominious end after he said in august that victims of ' legitimate rape ' are protected from pregnancies by their own female bodies rep. @entity0 and his staff have been similarly backing off of tuesday 's statement , and insisting that he did n't mean to suggest anything along the lines of @entity8 's controversial foot - in - mouth moment			1
' the congressman 's intended point , ' wrote communications director @entity80 in an email to @entity82 , ' was regarding the number of abortions after the beginning of the 6th month ' of pregnancy ... not the number of rapes that result in pregnancies			0
' the bill under debate , which @entity0 sponsored and which the @entity92 approved wednesday on a 20 - 12 vote , would take effect in the third trimester of gestation , and @entity0 addressed this directly in a statement to @entity82			1
' pregnancies from rape that result in abortion after the beginning of the sixth month are very rare , ' he claimed			0
' this bill does not address unborn children in earlier gestations			0
indeed , the bill does nothing to restrict abortions performed before the beginning of the 6th month			0
' @entity109 @entity53 rep. @entity108 let loose on @entity0 : ' the idea that @entity11 men on this committee think they can tell the women of @entity114 that they have to carry to term the product of a rape is outrageous ' still , @entity53 partisans are hopping mad and quickly tried to link @entity0 with @entity8			1
' like @entity8 's , @entity0 's claim is not supported by research , ' wrote the liberal @entity120			1
' medical experts agree that rape does not lower the incidence of pregnancy , and one study by the @entity126 found that more than 30,000 pregnancies result from rape in the @entity114 each year			2
' and the @entity129 noted a 2011 study from @entity131 that studied women in the @entity134 nation of @entity135 , concluding that ' female youth who have experienced sexual violence report significantly higher levels of unintended pregnancy ... compared to those who have not experienced sexual violence			2
' after @entity8 's comment made national news in august 2012 , the @entity141 reported that between 10,000 and 15,000 women in the @entity114 obtain abortions each year following rape - or incest - related pregnancies the @entity148 at @entity131 found that rape victims in @entity135 were more likely to become pregnant ' there is absolutely no veracity ' to @entity8 's claim , the organization insisted			1
to the claim that ' a woman who is raped has no control over ovulation , fertilization , or implantation of a fertilized egg ( ie , pregnancy )			0
to suggest otherwise contradicts basic biological truths			0
' @entity164 ' bill , @entity165 , includes an exception for women whose pregnancies are measured at 20 weeks or longer whose lives are threatened if they do n't abort their pregnancies			2
@entity171 , an @entity172 producer who covers @entity173 , interviewed franks tuesday evening and reported that the congressman said ' the reality is , it 's not @entity11 that are talking about this			0
it 's democrats that keep forcing the rape issue into this debate			0
they 've done it ever since @entity184			0
' rep. @entity108 , a @entity109 @entity186 , leapt into the debate tuesday after @entity0 made his position known , arguing that no man should be making health policy which could affect young women			1
. that her colleagues were in not a position understand what goes on in the life or mind of a young girl in crisis			0
' the idea that @entity11 men on this committee think they can tell the women of @entity114 that they have to carry to term the product of a rape is outrageous , ' she said			1
@entity0 said in a statement after the @entity92 's vote that “ [ k ] nowingly subjecting our innocent unborn children to dismemberment in the womb , particularly when they have developed to the point that they can feel excruciating pain every terrible moment leading up to their undeserved deaths , belies everything @entity114 was called to be			2
' ' this is not who we are			0

rep @entity0 claimed during a @entity222 debate that ' the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low '
2012 @entity9 candidate @entity8 lost big after saying ' ‘ if it ’s a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to shut that whole thing down . '
democrat @entity108 says ' @entity11 men on this committee ' should n't tell women ' that they have to carry to term the product of a rape '
@entity0 ' bill passed out of committee on a 20 - 12 vote , and would bar most abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy if it becomes *law*
