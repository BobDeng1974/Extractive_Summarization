by @entity0 high speed cameras allow researchers to see things that they would normally miss , from the beating wings of a hummingbird to how a boat cuts through water			0
now researchers in @entity9 have developed what they believe is the world ’s fastest camera , which can take 4.4 trillion images a second			2
the device uses a new technique to take high - speed images so it can capture chemical reactions and heat conduction , which were impossible to photograph before			1
researchers in @entity9 have developed what they believe is the world ’s fastest camera , which can take 4.4 trillion images a second			2
the large machine contains a pulse source , temporal and spatial mapping devices and an image sensor ( illustrated ) to take high resolution photographs at the rate of 4.4 trillion frames a second the new camera uses a technique called motion - based femtophotography to capture movement			1
it visually maps the movement of an object over time in a ‘ burst stream ’ of timed photographs organised in the correct sequence , to show an object ’s ‘ time varying spatial profile ’			1
the device claims to be 1,000 times faster than the previous ‘ fastest ’ camera , while still being able to produce high resolution images			1
the previous fastest cameras used a ‘ pump - probe process ’ where light is pumped at the object being photographed and then ‘ probed ’ for absorption by a laser , in order to collect vital data used to construct an image			2
up until now , the fastest cameras used a ‘ pump - probe process ’ , where light is pumped at the object being photographed and then probed for absorption by a laser , in order to collect vital data used to construct an image , @entity54 reported			0
but this technique relies on repetitive measurements to construct an image			0
instead , the new camera uses a technique called motion - based femtophotography to capture movement			1
the camera visually maps the movement of an object over time in a ‘ burst stream ’ of timed photographs organised in the correct sequence , to show an object ’s ‘ time varying spatial profile , ’ according to the journal @entity74			1
it was developed by scientists at the @entity79 and @entity80 in @entity9			2
the new camera will make it possible for scientists to capture chemical reactions and heat conduction that occurs at a sixth of the speed of light			1
one day it could also be used in medicine and to gain new insights into the manufacturing of computer chips ( pictured ) including their tiny semiconductors the device claims to be 1,000 times faster than the previous ‘ fastest ’ camera			0
it has high pixel resolution of 450 x 450 pixels to provide scientists with a lot of detail about the object they are photographing			0
the new camera is called @entity102 ( stamp ) and will be used to capture chemical reactions and heat conduction that occurs at a sixth of the speed of light			1
it has taken three years to develop and the next step is make the device smaller , as it measures around three square feet ( one square metre )			0
the experts who developed the machine believe it could one day be used in medicine and to gain new insights into the manufacturing of semiconductors , for example			0
the computer chip components are tiny and by looking at detailed images of the manufacturing process , experts might be able to spot opportunities to make efficiencies .			0

scientists from the @entity79 and @entity80 in @entity9 created the camera , which uses a technique called motion - based femtophotography
it maps the movement of an object over time into a ‘ burst stream ’ of photos
camera takes high resolution images at the rate of 4.4 trillion per second but is not compact , measuring around *3ft* or one metre in *length*
will be used to examine chemical reactions and heat conduction
