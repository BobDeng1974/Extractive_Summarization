by @entity0 published : 12:39 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 05:28 est , 19 october 2012 ' everyone grab a giant boob ! ' someone shouts			0
and they mean it in the best possible way			0
it 's 8am on a brisk wednesday morning , and 100 nimble - footed participants have gathered in central @entity9 to take part in a giant ' flashmob ' - a sudden choreographed dance routine set to music , aimed at surprising passers - by - and we 're all getting dressed up as enormous breasts			1
the event has been organised by breast cancer awareness charity @entity19 ! , the organisation founded by 26 - year - old identical twins @entity21 and @entity22 , whose lives were turned upside down in 2009			1
@entity21 and @entity22 , centre front right and left , stand either side of choreographer @entity26 , founder of @entity27 , to lead the @entity19 ! flashmob troupe in @entity30 's place that year , when the girls were just 23 , @entity21 was diagnosed with breast cancer - a horrifying eight months after first going to her gp with concerns about lumps she was finding in her painful chest			1
dismissed as ' hormones ' and told she was far too young to have the disease , the cancer went undiagnosed for so long that it spread to her spine , only finally diagnosed when the twins ' no - nonsense mother marched @entity21 to the doctor and demanded to be taken seriously			1
@entity21 now has stage four cancer , explaining that ' you ca n't go back a stage , and there is no stage five			1
' despite all this , @entity21 is ' living with cancer ' and doing ok			1
she still has treatment , but so far it 's all going well			2
( what 's more , her work has not gone unnoticed			2
she carried the @entity62 torch through @entity63 on 21 july , she 's been given a @entity64 , she 's attended a @entity66 reception and was shortlisted for the @entity67 in 2011			2
) @entity26 , centre front , choreographer and founder of @entity27 , leads the @entity19 ! flashmob in @entity9 's @entity72 this morning and on this crisp october morning just off @entity74 , she and her sister are virtually indistinguishable : two gorgeous leggy blondes who both look the picture of glowing health			1
( in fact , the only way many of us are able to tell them apart is by @entity21 's jazzy leggings			1
) but both @entity21 and @entity22 are insistent that no more young women get such a rude awakening as theirs , and so here we are , on @entity86 , during @entity87 , determined to bring attention to @entity19 ! , with inflatable breasts strapped to our fronts			1
@entity21 , left , and @entity22 , right , and their enormous breasts receive some admiring glances on @entity30 's place all 100 participants ( me included ) have been given an online link to a video of the routine which was put together by choreographer extraordinaire - and friend of the @entity103 - founder of @entity27 performing arts company , and winner of 2011 @entity106 in the arts category			1
so we 've all had time to practice and there is no excuse for putting a foot wrong			0
( that said , any neighbours who witnessed me clod - hopping around my sitting room at 5am this morning to @entity115 's i feel good and @entity116 by @entity117 would probably attest to the fact that i still needed much , much , much more practice			0
) @entity26 and her giant inflatable breast , centre , lead the others through the routine to the delight of passers - by after a quick run - through , we 're ready to go , positioned around the various mews entrances onto @entity86 , which is itself marking @entity87 by getting ' pink 'd ' , adorning the streets with pink bunting and running a number of themed events			0
@entity21 , left , and @entity22 , identical twins and founders of @entity19 ! by now it 's just before 9am , and the rush hour crowd is making its way to work , pausing to see what in the name of inflatable breasts is going on			1
the camera phones are coming out			0
we can hear the giggles over our nervous heartbeats			0
the music kicks in and the first gang of bouncing breasts run out , high - kicking , clapping , twisting , turning , rolling , jumping , leaping , grinning and , on occasion , whooping			0
right on cue ( my humps by the @entity153 ; are you sensing a theme to the aural selections yet ? ) , the second batch of breasts make a beeline for the front , pointing at their inflatable friends when @entity160 hollers ' check it out ! '			2
' checking it out ' is , after all , the point of our flashmob and the modus operandi of @entity19 !			2
@entity21 did n't check her breasts until it was too late			1
now she and @entity22 want us all - both women and men , for the disease can attack men , too - to cop a feel of ours			1
' the charity is particularly about getting young people to check their boobs , ' @entity21 , told @entity178			1
' i thought i was too young to get breast cancer and that it would never happen to me			1
young people need to become familiar with their breasts so they can sense when something changes			2
' but there 's no time for breast - checking just now in @entity30 's place : right now it 's time for me and my fellow breasts to bolt out of our starting blocks and into the melee			1
three dancers run out to join the @entity19 ! flashmob it all comes together and looks amazing - at least from where i 'm standing at the back of this sea of breasts			2
' we like doing fun things like this , ' said @entity21 , who prefers the term @entity203 to ceo when it comes to her charity			2
' the whole point of @entity19 ! is that we go about awareness in different and engaging ways			2
we like causing a bit of a stir			0
' we use these inflatable boobs stuffed with balloons for publicity events			0
the last thing we did was the @entity216 where 50 people from @entity218 wore them on the underground during rush hour			0
and people use them to run half marathons			0
' we have a big cinema advert coming out soon which is terrific because the more people who are aware of us and aware of the importance of checking your boobs the better			0
' the giant inflatable boobs really cause an impact which is why we like them			0
we have them made in different shades by a man in @entity236 - it 's funny because i do n't know if he has any idea what we use them for ! ' for more information and to sign up for breast - checking reminders , visit the @entity19 ! website			1
you can read @entity21 ' blog here			2
for more information about @entity30 's @entity249 campaign and the events taking place there this month , visit their website			1
' however you go about it , there is no right or wrong way to check your boobs , you just need to do it regularly			0
' get familiar with your breasts so you can spot any changes in them			0
' do n't do it during your period because lots of women get lumpy boobs during that time , so wait until it settles down			0
' it 's not just lumps you 're looking for			0
i had shooting pains in my armpit and a friend of mine who was diagnosed had incredibly painful breasts			2
' but you 're also looking for rashes on the breast , areas of thickening , nipple inversions or changes in size and shape , and discharge			0
' changes in the texture of your breast are important to look for , any sort of puckering of the skin			0
' and make sure you look all the way up to your armpits and collarbone - lots of people think breast cancer does n't go that far , but it does			1
' and the sooner you catch it the better			0
' early morning commuters did a double take at the sight of so many dancing breasts @entity306 's @entity86 supported @entity87 month by getting ' pink 'd with pink bunting and pink - themed events @entity21 , right , and @entity22 , left , get the giggles during the @entity19 ! flashmob @entity313 sea of dancing breasts took over @entity30 's place this morning to perform a flashmob for @entity87 @entity22 , @entity0 and @entity21 after the @entity19 ! flashmob former @entity19 ! events include the @entity216 one man really does @entity19 !
