but now @entity6 , @entity7 lies in ruins as a sad example of @entity11 industrial decline drastic : the mayor is now trying to come up with a drastic solution to save the city founded in 1906 by the @entity25 mayor @entity26 believes letting vast expanses of the city , founded in 1906 by the @entity25 , return to nature might be a solution			1
' i ’d like to see 100,000 folks in @entity6			2
that ’d be great , ' the mayor said reported @entity35			0
' we could probably do it in 35 square miles			0
' that equation would see 25 percent more residents on nearly 40 percent less land			0
solution : an administration building in the decaying city			2
mayor @entity26 thinks letting vast spanses of land return to nature might be a solution desolate : deconstruction of a storage facility in @entity6 , @entity7			1
@entity6 's heyday was in the post-war boom of the 1950s when almost 200,000 people lived and worked in the bustling city , 25 miles from @entity56 the city now owns 7,000 properties in @entity6 - many of them have been taken for non-payment of taxes			1
redevelopment director @entity62 has worked out that 6,500 them are abandoned			0
in the next few months the city is planning to auction off the housing for $ 1 each			0
the homes would each need $ 15,000 - $ 30,000 in repairs			0
buyers would have to agree to renovate their purchases as quickly as possible			0
if buildings are beyond repair , @entity35 reports that a ' deconstruction ' program could be initiated - to take apart buildings and recycle materials			0
@entity6 's heyday was in the post-war boom of the 1950s when almost 200,000 people lived and worked in the bustling city , 25 miles from @entity56			1
as the @entity11 manufacturing sector contracted , @entity6 's population fell by over 50 percent and no one now uses the once bustling train stations , churches and auditoriums that are now decaying as they are left to the elements			1
booming in 1966 : @entity87 covered approximately 1500 acres of the @entity7 shore of @entity89 and operated around the clock			0
cuts : this modern @entity11 ghost town began life as home for workers at the @entity25 plant until economic competition from abroad forced a 90 percent job cut frequently rated one of the ten most dangerous cities in the @entity11 , @entity6 once boomed with jobs and opportunities but now faces the acute difficulties of @entity11 's growing rust belt , with 22 percent of families in the once - great city now lying below the poverty line			1

thirty - thousand jobs were gone in a flash and the flight of people away from @entity6 led to whole swathes of buildings being abandoned such as the once proud @entity116 which was built in the 1920s			2
@entity25 paid $ 385,000 towards the $ 1 million construction costs of the church , which used to hold 950 people every sunday and boasted a total congregation of 3,000			0
decline : @entity6 once boomed with jobs and opportunities but now faces the acute difficulties of @entity11 's growing rust belt ghost town : thirty - thousand jobs were gone in a flash and the flight of people away from @entity6 led to whole swathes of buildings being abandoned the church also had a large school , gymnasium and an auditorium named the @entity132 where the city would hold community meetings , plays and musical events			1
by 1970 the number of attendees for sunday mass had fallen to 100 and in 1975 the church closed for good and began its long decent into despair			0
lying dormant and unused since then , many plans have been mooted to restore the place of worship including turning the vast empty spaces into a centre for performing arts or even to gracefully culture the ruins into an open garden			0
however , with no funds and no concrete interest , the @entity2 of @entity6 has allowed the crumbling building to become a symbol of the decline of northwest @entity7 and @entity11 industry			2
other building 's such as the city 's @entity158 are potent reminders of the heights that @entity6 has fallen from			1
constructed to feed the growing city in 1910 , the station lasted only another five decades before being closed and left to nature to take its course			0
in fact , in 2008 , the station was used as an example of what would happen to a @entity56 building if no people were around to tend to its upkeep in the series ' @entity175 '			0
the 10,000 @entity176 on the western edge of @entity178 in @entity6 , @entity7 has laid in ruins since 1976 , only 20 years after it opened			2
with no one around the watch the football games in the city , the stadium was shut , but not before it had hosted @entity6 's most famous son 's , the @entity186 for a 1969 concert			1
