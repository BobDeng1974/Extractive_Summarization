@entity2 put a finger under his nose to represent a @entity12 moustache and marched around the @entity13 care home in @entity15 like @entity16 in the comedy classic @entity18			1
he reduced a patient who suffered from delusions that he was @entity12 to tears			1
the patient – identified as @entity23 – had a strange obsession with @entity7 and suffered from hallucinations			2
@entity2 cruelly encouraged him to live out his fantasy by performing the salutes made famous by the @entity7 regime and shouting ' @entity29 ' , a @entity31 ( @entity31 ) panel found			1
the nurse ’s behaviour came to light when bosses at the @entity36 investigated a seven - month campaign of sexual harassment against a @entity40 colleague , known only as @entity41 the former deputy ward manager , who had worked at @entity43 in @entity44 for more than two decades , made the @entity7 salutes in front of @entity46 and a male @entity48 colleague , known as mr @entity49 @entity2 , 54 , flies a @entity52 ’s flag from his home in @entity15			1

he sent explicit messages to the @entity46 , groped mr @entity57 and made racist remarks , and repeatedly grabbed a male patient 's genitals			1
@entity61 , who still works at the ward , told the hearing : ‘ he would mimic the patient who had been doing the @entity7 salutes			2
‘ he would be marching up and down saluting and shouting			0
' she said he would raise his arm to a @entity7 salute with a finger below her nose			0
guilt : a panel at the @entity31 , pictured , found @entity2 , 54 , guilty of eight allegations of misconduct in 2008 and 2009 she added : ‘ it would wind [ patient c ] up and he would cry			1
he [ @entity2 ] would do the baiting			2
’ miss @entity61 told the hearing that the patient had an obsession with @entity7 and would suffer hallucinations			0
she added : ‘ the patient would often speak in a @entity86 accent and go on about @entity7			0
he ’d say he was @entity12			2
’ @entity87 , the clinical manager at the time , told the panel @entity2 would incite the patient to shout ‘ @entity29 ’			1
mr @entity87 , who now works at the @entity91 in @entity92 , added : ‘ mr @entity2 was very black and white			2
‘ he either liked you or he did n’t – and that tended to be people that were ethnic minority or people not @entity98			0
‘ he was very @entity98			0
’ he also performed the role of a @entity86 soldier in front of @entity46 , which she was said to find ‘ particularly offensive as she is @entity40 , and associations with the @entity105 have particularly offensive significance to her			2
’ @entity2 , who lives in a quiet @entity107 in @entity108 , @entity44 , called mr @entity57 by the names of @entity111 terrorist organisations , @entity110 and @entity112 , and once said to him , ‘ @entity113 go home ’			1
the male care assistant also reported @entity2 to police for grabbing his genitals at work while another colleague pinned his arms behind his back			1
torment : @entity2 reduced a patient who suffered from delusions that he was @entity12 , pictured , to tears @entity2 denied the charges , accusing colleagues of conspiring against him and making him a scapegoat			1
but @entity129 , chair of the @entity31 panel , said : ' the panel is not satisfied that any of the witnesses have colluded , that mr @entity2 has been made a scapegoat or accused of any of these things for any reason other than the facts included in the charges			2
' the panel also found @entity2 guilty of grabbing another patient 's genitals on an almost daily basis			1
miss @entity61 said in a statement : ' mr @entity2 would stand facing him and hold the patient 's genitals through his clothing			1
' mr @entity2 would grab the patient 's genitals all the time , i would say this happened on a nearly daily basis			1
' he did it to make people laugh , the staff would laugh			0
' @entity2 's campaign of harassment began just three weeks after @entity46 joined @entity43 , after the pair took a patient on a trip to @entity158			1
' mr @entity2 sent a pornographic photograph of a woman 's vagina ' , said mr @entity162			1
' she found this disgusting , showed the picture to her boyfriend , and then deleted it			0
she replied to mr @entity2 , telling him to grow up			0
' but @entity2 continued to bombard her with messages , saying , ' you sexy momma , i love you			0
' he added : ' do n't you give up on me ' and ' i want to complete you : ) xxxxx ' , and repeatedly tried to call her at midnight			0
' mr @entity2 himself performed a @entity7 salute while in her presence and while looking at her , ' added mr @entity162			0
' she found this particularly offensive as she is @entity40 , and associations with the @entity105 have particularly offensive significance to her			2
' ' @entity46 felt threatened by his conduct and felt that if she did n't tell mr @entity2 what he wanted to hear he would make her life at work very difficult			0
' unacceptable : @entity2 's tasteless behaviour is reminiscent of a memorable scene in @entity18 in which @entity16 goose - steps around his hotel the tribunal heard the sexual texts stopped when @entity2 's wife , who also works at the trust , saw a message and called @entity46 to confront her			2
after @entity46 reported @entity2 's advances , mr @entity57 came forward to report the deputy ward manager for groping him while on duty			1

' he ( the other male ) grabbed both my hands behind my back , mr @entity2 grabbed my genitals outside of my clothes , ' he said			1
the panel was told that the staff nurse mr @entity57 had been speaking to at the time was still present and took a photograph of the incident			0

he admitted sending the texts to @entity46 , but claimed it was part of a two - way consensual conversation			0
@entity2 said the thought of being in the same building as mr @entity57 ' makes me feel sick ' , and did not attend the central @entity158 hearing			0
@entity2 's fitness to practice was later found to be impaired by reason of misconduct at the @entity31			1
panel chair @entity129 said : ' it is unlikely mr @entity2 would have treated a patient without a mental health disability in this manner and his conduct amounts to discrimination on the basis of disability			2
' he abused his senior position and did not treat patients or staff with respect or dignity			0
