several @entity1 exchanges in states that did n't participate in the healthcare.gov fiasco are now having so much trouble with their own health insurance websites that they 're withholding payments to their biggest it contractor â€“ and it 's the same company that botched the federal government 's insurance portal			2
@entity13 , the @entity14 company behind the @entity16 's error - prone , $ 677 million online white elephant , is under fire in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 after those states ' @entity1 websites suffered from some of the same problems that first made @entity1 a late - night punchline in october			1
the @entity26 has paid just $ 11 million to @entity13 for the @entity18 project , although the website contract carried a $ 69 price tag , according to @entity30			1
a @entity18 government official who requested anonymity told @entity33 that his state was ' just one of the governments that got substandard , messed - up results ' from the contractors it chose			2
' if we could do it all over again , ' the official said , ' we would have been better off hiring a half - dozen undergrads at @entity44			1
' during his end - of - year press conference , president @entity45 blamed some of his administration 's health care website woes on the rules that govern how it work is contracted @entity26 in @entity18 is out tens of millions as its uers continue to struggle with a faulty website @entity54 , executive director of the @entity55 , resigned on dec. 6 because her state 's @entity1 website was weeks late and registered hundreds -- instead of tens of thousands -- of new insurance customers spokesman @entity61 told the @entity62 that ' @entity13 has consistently underperformed , which is frustrating and a serious concern			1
' ' we are holding the vendor accountable for its underperformance and will continue to apply nonstop pressure to work to fix defects and improve performance			0
' the state 's officials will hold a january 9 meeting to determine how to proceed , but they 're not pleased with the progress so far			0
@entity74 , saddled with an $ 89 million contract on a website that would n't reliably let taxpayers enroll in coverage until early december , has held back $ 5.1 million of the $ 11 million @entity13 has billed to date , and is challenging other invoices totaling more than another $ 1 million			1
' i 've lost confidence in the contractors that were supposed to deliver a fully functioning website on oct. 1 , ' @entity19 governor @entity80 told the @entity62			0
' i 'm going to continue to hold their feet to the fire until they get it right			0
' typical : @entity90 ( r ) , the secretary of health and human services and the @entity16 's chief @entity1 cheerleader , was left ashen - faced during a november photo - op when volunteers could n't use @entity96 @entity74 has performed so poorly that the state is withholding at least $ 6.1 million from @entity100 's @entity99 arm @entity20 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity104 all used @entity13 as their principal @entity1 website contractor , and some have fared better than others			1
still sick : as the year 's final @entity1 enrollment deadline arrived this week , the web portal still was n't performing as advertised @entity104 has been a rare bright spot in president @entity45 's plan to replace the nation 's medical insurance system with government - brokered insurance marketplaces			2
but @entity20 's opened two weeks later than promised , and has performed so poorly that its executive director resigned on december 6			1
@entity100 's @entity99 arm also has a $ 93.7 million contract with the federal government , but a @entity119 official told @entity33 that the amount of its billings would not be made public			1
overall , @entity123 has paid out $ 319 million to the contractors responsible for building healthcare.gov , a yet - to - be - completed project that @entity128 experts have told reporters should have cost no more than $ 10 million to bring online			2
president @entity45 said during a dec. 20 press conference that the federal government 's contracting rules were partly responsible for the debacle			0
' part of it , as i 've said before , had to do with how it procurement generally is done , ' he said			0
a month earlier , @entity45 told a group of @entity140 ceos that ' the way the federal government does procurement and does it is just generally not very efficient			0
' ' in fact , there 's probably no bigger gap between the private sector and the public sector , ' he lamented .			0

' if we could do it all over again , ' a @entity18 official said , ' we would have been better off hiring a half - dozen undergrads at @entity44 '
@entity19 , @entity20 and @entity18 are among the states *complaining* about how @entity100 's @entity99 arm handled their @entity1 sites
@entity18 is holding back all but $ 11 million of $ 69 million in contract payments until its site works properly
@entity19 is stopping payment on at least $ 6.1 million to the same firm
@entity20 's web portal *launched* two weeks late and performed so badly that the executive director of the state insurance exchange resigned in *disgrace*
