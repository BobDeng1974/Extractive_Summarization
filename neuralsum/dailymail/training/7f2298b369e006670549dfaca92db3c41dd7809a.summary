@entity1 manager @entity0 wants work permits for foreign footballers to be scrapped			1
the @entity4 , who revealed he missed out on bringing @entity5 to the club nine years ago due to employment red tape , says the @entity9 ’s football authorities should open its borders to all overseas players , not just those who qualify for the necessary paperwork			2
@entity1 are poised to sign @entity15 ’s @entity14 , who has a £ 15million release clause			1
but the transfer is reliant on the @entity18 obtaining a work permit , which will not be a foregone conclusion given the central defender has not played international football			2
@entity1 manager @entity0 wants work permits for foreign footballers to be scrapped @entity15 's @entity14 ( right ) could be heading for @entity1 if they can secure a work permit rules state that only players who have played 75 per cent of matches for a nation inside @entity29 ’s top 70 within the past two years are eligible for work permits			1
this is to safeguard the progress of academy players into first teams			2
@entity1 say they will appeal if @entity35 can not join them this month			1
next season new rules will see players who cost £ 10m and over automatically granted a work permit			1
but @entity0 says all work permit regulations should be abandoned , claiming it would help produce more accomplished youngsters			1
‘ the target of the @entity43 , to be the best league in the world , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ so you have to open it completely			0
‘ we identified @entity49 when he was 17			0
we wanted him to come here , but he goes to @entity50 , from @entity50 he goes to @entity51			0
why ? because he could not get a work permit here			2
that means you can only get him to @entity56 once he is worth a huge amount of money			1
’ defender @entity35 is yet to make a senior appearance for the @entity18 national side @entity0 revealed he could have signed @entity5 nine years ago but he could n't get a work permit on the impact abolishing work permit rules would have on academies , @entity0 said : ‘ we live in a world where artificial protection is negative			1
if you want to be the best league in the world then you have to accept you have to produce the best players in the world			2
‘ so the question is , how can you produce the best players ? ‘ there ’s two ways to approach the solution of the academies			2
you close completely the borders and you play only with @entity56 players			1
what will that do ? that will kill the attractiveness of the @entity43 and i think that ’s not the best way to develop the best players			2
‘ one thing is for sure : if you put a young player with top level players he has more chance to develop			1
if you put him with average players he has more chances to remain average			2
we have to accept that			0
it ’s the same if you have children			0
you put them in the top class and if they are talented they develop better than if you put them in an average class			0
@entity0 said , that contrary to belief , work permit rules do not help the development of @entity56 youngsters the @entity102 recently signed young @entity104 midfielder @entity103 from @entity105 ‘ at the moment the whole speech is “ let ’s put them in an average class ”			1
that does n’t work for the development			2
so we have to say maybe “ let ’s put them in the top class and see how we can help them reach that level ”			0
the politically correct speech at the moment is the opposite “ let ’s protect them and not expose them to world - class competition ”			0
‘ i do n’t really understand the logic of the new rule next season , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ what does it mean if he comes into the country anyway just with a huge amount of money			0
that is the only difference			0
and who do you pay this huge amount of money to ? a club like @entity135			0
they do n’t need the money			0
’ meanwhile , more doubt has been cast over goalkeeper @entity140 ’s future at the @entity141 , with @entity1 keeping tabs on @entity144 ’s @entity143 , who is also a target for @entity146			1
who is @entity14 ? he ’s a 24 - year - old @entity18 centre back who plays for @entity51 side @entity15			0
what type of @entity151 is he ? he ’s a very physical defender and , in theory , his aerial ability and pace should help him adapt to the @entity43			0
his proactive , aggressive style of defending is similar to that of @entity157 , though his technique and distribution are n’t quite on the same level as the @entity4 ’s			0
so why is he in such high demand ? @entity15 boast the equal third best defence in @entity163 this season — conceding only two more goals than table - topping @entity135 — and @entity35 is an integral part of it			0
also , he has recorded the second - highest number of interceptions in the league this campaign ( 66 )			0
how would he fit in at @entity1 ? he would likely provide back - up to @entity157 and @entity172 for the time being , though @entity1 ’s injury record and dearth of central defenders may mean he is called into action sooner rather than later			1
given a prolonged spell in the starting @entity179 , he could prove to be the dominant , fearless presence @entity1 fans have craved for some time .			1

@entity0 says work permits for foreign players should be scrapped
the rules are *designed* to help *promote* young @entity56 talent
but the @entity1 boss said the rules are *harmful* for @entity56 players
he claimed young talent develops better when surrounded by other talent
