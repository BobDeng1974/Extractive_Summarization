an april 20 @entity15 report tries to shed light on the strange @entity18 story , starting with 19 - year - old @entity19			0
after a mutual friend introduced @entity19 to several other young men in @entity23 , @entity18 , police say @entity19 made a proposition that would eventually leave @entity25 , 19 , @entity26 , 19 , @entity27 , 27 , @entity28 , 26 , and @entity29 , 18 all awaiting trial for @entity19 ’s own violent kidnapping and possibly the death of @entity25 ’s girlfriend @entity33 , 21			1
star - crossed : @entity25 ( left ) kidnapped and brutally beat @entity19 after , police say , collaborating with him in a $ 600k heist that eventually left girlfriend @entity33 ( right ) dead at the hands of police duped ? @entity28 , pictured , is one of five men who face kidnapping charges after police say they were double - crossed by @entity19 @entity19 ’s uncle , it seemed , was allegedly involved in the marijuana growing business and kept a healthy sum of cash in the family home			1
the plan : with @entity19 ’s explicit instructions and with him waiting in the getaway car , the other men , led by @entity25 , would enter @entity19 ’s uncle ’s home , push aside @entity19 ’s grandmother and baby sister and lug out a safe full of over $ 600,000 in cash			1
‘ he told us all the little information , every detail about his uncle , his family , ’ @entity25 told the @entity15			0
‘ where it was located and what time to go in , who was inside the house , everything			0
’ in may 2012 , the men allegedly succeeded in their mission			0
back with @entity19 , they would split the mountain of cash			1
but that ’s when things took a turn			0
according to @entity25 and the rest , @entity19 took far more than his fair share			0
and @entity19 would do little to dissuade @entity25 and even his own family of that fact			1
though he told @entity25 that he only took his portion and denied any knowledge of the theft to his family , the unemployed @entity19 would suddenly start driving a 2010 @entity80			2
his family was immediately suspicious and @entity25 , too , began to watch @entity19 closely			1
‘ i did n’t pay him no mind , ’ @entity19 later said , though he would live to regret it			0
police say that 's when @entity25 and his friends decided to set up @entity19 to take him down			1
on august 8 , @entity19 and his friend @entity86 , 17 , left a teen pool party but were lured back by a phone call from @entity25 ’s girlfriend @entity33 at @entity91 ’s behest			2
bad idea : along with @entity28 , @entity27 , left , and @entity26 , right , helped @entity94 kidnap and brutalize @entity19 before they fell asleep and @entity19 ran away naked , according to police @entity97 : @entity98 , 18 , is the youngest of the men police say helped kidnap @entity19 , leading to the death of @entity33 @entity25 and his friends allegedly jumped @entity19 and @entity86 and took them back to @entity33 ’s place where they tied them up and beat them brutally			1
@entity19 claims @entity25 made no mention of the stolen cash and was instead beating him mercilessly for much smaller trifles			2
‘ the only thing he said to me “ this is because you were flirting with my girlfriend , ” ’ @entity19 said			2
shortly thereafter , the kidnappers , who police say were under the influence of drugs , fell asleep			0
meanwhile , @entity19 ’s family ran to the police and @entity19 himself was able to escape as his kidnappers snoozed			1
shortly thereafter , tragedy struck			0
nearly naked and plodding through the streets of @entity123 , @entity19 managed to call police and inform them where he was			2
they reached @entity33 ’s trailer and burst inside to find her wielding a revolver			0
‘ the police were forced to utilize deadly force , ’ reads the arrest report			0
@entity33 was shot dead by officers on the scene			0
the rest of the men were arrested and now , under @entity18 law , face charges of @entity33 ’s death in addition to the kidnapping charges			2
they ’ve all pleaded not guilty while @entity19 still faces charges for the may 2012 theft of his uncle 's safe .			1

authorities say the bizarre saga began when @entity23 teenager @entity19 enlisted the help of five other young men to *rob* his own family of a safe full of cash
after an apparent betrayal and at least one set of wandering eyes , police say @entity19 was kidnapped by his former *cohorts* and brutally beaten before making his break in the buff
now the men will stand trial for @entity19 's kidnapping as well as for the death of one of the kidnappers ' young girlfriend
