by @entity1 reporter published : 16:50 est , 3 march 2013 updated : 08:27 est , 4 march 2013 after nearly losing control of their space capsule , private outer space shipping firm @entity6 overcame mechanical difficulties and delivered over a ton of supplies to the eager inhabitants of the @entity11			1
to @entity15 's relief , when the company 's unmanned dragon capsule pulled up to the space lab 250 miles about @entity19 , all its systems were in perfect order			1
however , the timing could have been a bit better			0
coming a full day late , the linkup was the culmination of a two - day chase that got off to a shaky , almost dead - ending start			1
moments after the @entity27 reached orbit friday , a clogged pressure line or stuck valve prevented the release of the solar panels and the crucial firing of small maneuvering rockets			2
" as they say , it 's not where you start , but where you finish that counts , " space station commander @entity52 said after capturing the @entity27 , " and you guys really finished this one on the mark			2
" he added : " we 've got lots of science on there to bring aboard and get done			0
so congratulations to all of you			0
" among the items on board : 640 seeds of a flowering weed used for research , mouse stem cells , food and clothes for the six men on board the space station , trash bags , computer equipment , air purifiers , spacewalking tools and batteries			2
helping hand : the ' @entity78 ' reached out to grab the rogue capsule , which had suffered temporary failure of its solar panels the company also tucked away apples and other fresh treats from an employee 's family orchard , a much appreciated infusion of fresh food for the six - person crew unable to drop by their local green market			1
@entity27 will remain at the space station for most of march before returning to @entity92 with science samples , empty food containers and old equipment			0
the @entity97 - based @entity6 run by billionaire @entity98 has a $ 1.6 billion , contract with @entity15 to keep the station well stocked through 12 supply runs			1
this is the third time a @entity27 has visited the space station			0
sweet relief : @entity15 got sweet relief when the @entity27 was finally plucked from space , and so will the men on board who 'll be treated to fresh apples the previous capsules had no trouble reaching their destination			2
@entity115 officials promise a thorough investigation into what went wrong this time ; if the maneuvering thrusters had not been activated , the capsule would have been lost			0
@entity52 said everything about sunday 's rendezvous ended up being " fantastic			0
" " there sure were some big smiles all around here , " @entity15 's @entity123 replied from @entity124			2
proclaimed @entity6 on its web site : " @entity129			2
" high priority : the capsule contained vital technology and lab equipment , over one ton of cargo all told in a tweet following friday 's nerve - racking drama , @entity98 said , " just want to say thanks to @ @entity15 for being the world 's coolest customer			1
looking forward to delivering the goods ! " @entity98 , who helped create @entity141 , acknowledged friday that the problem — the first ever for an orbiting @entity27 — was " frightening			1
" but he believed it was a one - time glitch and nothing so serious as to imperil future missions			0
@entity147 ambitions : @entity6 launched the dragon ( pictured ) march 1 and hopes to start putting human beings into space by 2015 the 41 - year - old entrepreneur , who also runs the electric car maker @entity152 , oversaw the entire operation from @entity154 , @entity155 , home to @entity6 and the company 's @entity123			1
@entity27 's splashdown in the @entity158 , off the @entity97 coast , remains on schedule for march 25			0
@entity15 is counting on the commercial sector to supply the space station for the rest of this decade ; it 's supposed to keep running until at least 2020			1
@entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 are doing their part , periodically launching their own cargo ships			0
but none of those craft can return items like the @entity27 can ; they burn up on re-entry			0
@entity165 also is providing rides for astronauts — the only game in town since the retirement of @entity15 's space shuttles in 2011			1
@entity6 , or more formally @entity6 , leads the commercial pack that is working toward launching astronauts in another few years			2
@entity98 said he can have people flying on a modified dragon by 2015			1
@entity15 's shuttles used to be the main haulers for the space station			1
at the @entity191 direction , the space agency opted out of the @entity92 - to - orbit transportation business in order to focus on deep space exploration			0
@entity195 is the ultimate destination .			0

250 miles high , the @entity6 company 's dragon capsule had @entity15 holding its *breath* during two day chase *due* to solar panel *malfunction*
this was the leading private spaceship company 's third *docking* with the space lab
run by billionaire @entity141 *founder* @entity98 , @entity6 seeks to put people in space by 2015
