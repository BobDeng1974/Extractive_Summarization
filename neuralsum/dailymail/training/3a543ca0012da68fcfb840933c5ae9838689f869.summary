by @entity1 reporter published : 10:57 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 11:38 est , 24 august 2013 many men are often told how much they look like their fathers , especially as they get older , a statement that sparked an idea for a photo project for @entity7			1
the @entity9 - based photographer decided to overlap photos of fathers and sons to help focus the eye on the similarities in facial features between the different generations			1
@entity7 took countless photos of each subject to ensure that he had shots of both father and son ’s faces that were aligned at the same angle for his photo series ‘ boys and their fathers			2
’ by overlapping the images the father and sons appear to have far more physical attributes in common than one would notice by simply looking at them next to each other			0
each photograph urges the viewer to take a closer look at both father and son , showing that we are genetically bonded to our families , no matter how different we seem to be , reports @entity39 .			0

photographer @entity7 has *combined* photos of fathers and sons to show how similar their facial features are
