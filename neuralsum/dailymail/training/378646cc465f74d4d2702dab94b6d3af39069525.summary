@entity0 has taken action after its search engine was found to be suggesting vile racist terms when users searched for a number of @entity7 cities including @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
the search engine was found to be making crude and offensive suggestions when users typed in ' why is ' followed by the name of a city			1
for example , if a user typed in the phrase ' why is @entity8 ... ' the site automatically suggested the search ' why is @entity8 so full of p * * * *			1
' typing in the phrase with @entity9 and @entity10 also produced similar results			0
@entity0 took action after its search engine was found to be producing racist slurs			1
if users typed in ' why is ' followed by a number of @entity7 cities it would auto - complete the search to ' so full of p * * * * ' ( library image ) @entity0 took immediate action against the @entity34 suggestions and removed all of them from the site			1
certain other racist insults do remain , however			2
the site said the suggestions are produced by combining algorithms that predict what people will search for with popular searches			1
the internet giant said : ' autocomplete is a feature of @entity0 search that offers predicted searches to help you more quickly find what you ’re looking for			2
' these searches are produced automatically based on a number of factors including the popularity of search terms			1
' we periodically update our systems to improve @entity59 , so the terms that appear in @entity34 may change over time			2
' speaking with @entity61 at @entity62 , @entity64 mp for @entity66 @entity65 said : ' i am shocked these search options come up			2
last year , he confirmed the site would block all links to child abuse online ' it is totally unacceptable and i will be raising this matter in @entity75 ' @entity0 has come under fire in the past for acting slowly to remove or block indecent images online			0
the company initially refused to sign up to an alert system that would block people from viewing vile images on the internet , saying it had its own methods of blocking such material			2
at the time , the @entity86 , which is chaired by mr @entity65 , accused ' complacent ' internet service providers and search engines of being ' far too laid back about what takes place on their watch '			0
speaking in july last year , he said : ' the prime minister was right to highlight the responsibility of the internet service providers , search engines and social media sites			0
' they are far too laid back about what takes place on their watch and they need to do more to take inappropriate content down			0
if they do not act , the government should legislate			0
' however , in november the company 's ceo @entity69 said the search engine would block all links to child sexual abuse online			1
in a piece in the @entity111 , he wrote : ' we 've fine - tuned @entity113 to prevent links to child sexual abuse material from appearing in our results			0
' in 2012 , @entity0 rejected the @entity118 ’s request to remove a controversial anti-islam @entity120 clip that sparked violent @entity122 protests across the globe			0
instead the internet company , who own @entity120 , censored the video in several locations as well as blocking it in @entity129 and @entity130 - where @entity132 embassies were stormed by protestors enraged over the depiction of the @entity135 as a fraud and philanderer .			0
