for someone stuck in the middle of an uncharacteristic goal drought , @entity1 ’s thirst for hitting the net remains as typically unquenchable as ever			1
since returning to @entity6 for a second spell , the highest scorer in the modern history of the @entity11 top flight could not have foreseen in his worst nightmares that he would approach october without a single strike in the league to his name			1
the 31 - year - old is not only without a goal in his last five games , but has drawn a blank in nine of his 11 outings this season for the @entity23 side			1
the only times he has found the net have been against modest lower - league opponents , notching three against @entity27 in the @entity28 and two in the @entity30 against @entity31			1
@entity6 striker @entity1 ( right ) promoting the game with @entity34 's @entity33 and @entity36 pundit @entity35 @entity35 and @entity1 took to @entity37 ahead of @entity6 v @entity34 the @entity39 striker has found goals hard to come by in the league @entity1 , to his credit , takes questions on his lack of goals straight on the chin			1
where there might once have been a scowl and a stare at his media inquisitors , there is now an honest admission that he need to find the net soon or face losing his place to those of his squad mates who are producing the goods			0
‘ i base myself on goals and i know i have to start scoring goals if i am going to keep myself in the team , ’ he conceded			1
‘ i might be doing other things in my game better than i did in the past , but i need to start scoring goals			1
‘ i am not going to hide away from the fact i have missed chances			0
some of the chances i have missed have not been like me			0
but i wo n’t hide on the pitch			0
there is no greater feeling than scoring goals for this club and i want to get back to doing that			1
’ perhaps in the past @entity1 might have pleaded with his team - mates to play more to his strengths to enable him to get on the scoresheet			1
@entity1 tries to battle his way through against @entity80 pair @entity79 and @entity81 @entity33 and @entity1 were all smiles on the putting green - but things will be less jovial on monday night @entity6 striker @entity1 is desperate to get off the mark in the @entity11 @entity85 but he said : ‘ as a team i feel we are creating chances			1
they might not be for me , but we are scoring two , three , four goals in games and the most important thing is the team winning			1
‘ there ’s competition for places			0
@entity97 came into the team and did well , @entity98 is back from injury now and @entity100 came in against @entity101 on tuesday and scored			2
‘ but i do feel it will change for me			0
we have got players in the team who are capable of creating chances for me and it will surely turn pretty soon			2
’ it should be pointed out that this is not @entity1 ’s longest dry spell in @entity11 football			2
that came in 2010 when he went seven games in a row without hitting the back the net as he searched for his 100th @entity116 goal for @entity6			1
he later went 10 games in a row without finding the net for @entity120 in the @entity121			2
the @entity39 international battles for possession with @entity101 's @entity124 in their @entity30 match @entity100 ( left ) and @entity98 provide competition for places in attack for @entity6 @entity1 in @entity6 training with team - mate @entity130 some strikers might turn to bizarre superstitious routines to help them break the cycle when in the middle of a goal drought , but the former @entity137 and @entity136 forward insists he is n’t one of them			1
‘ there were no superstitions when i was scoring so i will just train and prepare the way i always do , ’ said @entity1 during his promotional duties for monday night ’s game at home to @entity34 , live on @entity36			1
‘ i have been through stages like this in my career before			0
but those are the standards that i ’ve set			0
i was scoring more or less every game first time round at @entity6 and i need to get back to doing that			1
‘ what you do in these situations is you keep getting into positions to miss or score chances			2
i have set the standard with the way i have finished over the last nine or 10 years and i feel i should have scored some of my chances recently			2
‘ but i would be more worried if i was n’t getting chances			0
in the @entity162 game , i missed a few , but i have fed off scraps in the others			0
‘ i will just keep plugging away and getting myself into positions to get back on the goal trail			0
i know it wo n’t be far round the corner			0
it is a matter of time			0
as long as you keep working hard and getting into positions , it will change pretty soon			0
‘ i hope it will be on monday night because we have a massive game against @entity34 at @entity23			1
‘ i feel they will be in the race for the title by the end of the season			2
it might have been a bit of a difficult start for them , but they are a good team and they can cause us problems			2
‘ it ’s a challenge for this club to show that it should be back at the top			0
i hope it is just a matter of time until we get there			0
