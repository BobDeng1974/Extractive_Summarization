@entity0 is well and truly on the @entity2 map			1
the @entity3 has opened its second hotel there – a definite seal of approval , as their other @entity2 offering is in fashionable @entity8 , seconds from @entity9 and the @entity10			1
the new property sits in a @entity13 - listed building - at 199 - 206 @entity14 - which was once occupied by @entity15			1
it is seconds from @entity0 , and five minutes from another lovely accommodation newcomer to the area , the @entity21 , which launched last october			2
new boy in town : the @entity8 , @entity0 is the second @entity2 hotel opened by the chic accommodation brand heart of the matter : the new hotel brings a dash of east @entity2 style to the centre of the @entity32 capital if you are making a weekend of it , there is plenty to see in the area – the sir @entity39 's museum , which is piled high with ancient archaeological artefacts ; the elegant enclave of @entity42 , where barristers toil day and night ; the little boutique stores of @entity46 's @entity45			1
the theatre district is also nearby , so it is perhaps unsurprising that hotel has an arty edge			1
it will be hosting events with a cultural theme , including a reading by @entity55 of her new novel @entity57			2
the entrance is an open - plan space , with a welcoming bar area and a cluster of squashy sofas			2
upstairs , the ambience is a little more industrial , with steel - grey painted corridors and moody lighting			2
antique telephones , school desks and anatomical sculptures of human heads are also dotted about			0
come in , take a seat , grab a drink : the hotel 's reception area has a warm , welcoming vibe a little brush - up : guests can enjoy a spot of pampering at the hotel 's funky nail bar the rooms are modest but refined			1
there are 174 of them , and they come in four categories – @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
mine is @entity88 in every sense			0
but with prices from £ 119 ( or from just £ 69 for the @entity87 ) - astonishing for central @entity2 – you ca n’t really complain			1
the hotel is recommended for solo travellers , and i can see why			1
there are no wardrobes , and you would be hard pushed to store a suitcase			0
however , my room is cleverly designed , with a corner shower tiled in black @entity104 - style , an enormous circular mirror and a fold - out desk with a kettle , plus a matte black @entity108			1
i also like the contemporary @entity111 wallpaper			0
and when i open the beside - table - slash - mini - bar , i find that rarest of hotel extras , fresh milk			1
hurrah ! you 'll fit right in : the hotel boasts four sizes of room - in this case , cosy ( pretty accurately named , all told ) the bed is supremely comfy , and even on a murky morning , the view - which stretches all the way to the @entity126 - is uplifting			1
i wander down for breakfast in the @entity129 and @entity130 restaurant - where the crowd could be described as ' normcore '			0
the waiters and waitresses are dressed in matching blue shirts , navy trousers and black trainers			0
people are working at laptops ; many are sipping at ' cold - pressed ' juices			0
the menu is described as ' @entity143 style ' , and features spelt pancakes , avocado on toast and ( somewhat incongruously ) a @entity148			2
milk is in miniature glass bottles , and the coffee will put a spring in your step			0
if you want to simply get up and go , the hotel will provide a takeaway breakfast of granola , banana and orange juice , delivered to your room in a paper bag			2
handy if you are in a rush			0
swinging a cat , just : other room sizes include the @entity164 - where @entity165 burrowed down for the night great location , surprising prices : the hotel 's room rates are unusually low for a property in central @entity2 there is the @entity172 , too - a café next door where you can grab a coffee			1
this , and their @entity177 , located in the basement , will no doubt be popular local additions			0
the latter is a classier take on @entity182 's , with @entity184 rotisserie chicken cooked on a spit - doled out with crinkle - cut chips , butter lettuce and avocado salad , and served at wooden tables on enamel plates with lashings of spicy sauce			2
the service is swift and the place is buzzing			0
there ’s no lingering here			0
better to head upstairs and park yourself in the main bar for the rest of the evening			0
the @entity8 , @entity0 ( 020 7661 3000 ; thehoxton.com / london / holborn )			1
rates start at £ 69 .			1

hotel brand opens a second property in @entity2 , this time in the centre
the group 's *original* property , in @entity8 , east @entity2 , is a city style icon
prices are surprisingly low for a central location , with rooms starting at £ 69
