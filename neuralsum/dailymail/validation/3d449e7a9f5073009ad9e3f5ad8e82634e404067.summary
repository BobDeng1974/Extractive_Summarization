@entity0 claims the ' @entity2 ' condiment package he patented in 1997 led @entity3 to develop its @entity5 ketchup packets , which it rolled out in february 2010 a @entity9 food entrepreneur claims the ' @entity2 ' condiment package he patented in 1997 led @entity3 to develop its @entity11 ketchup packets , which it rolled out in february 2010 , lawyers in opening statements told a federal court jury in @entity13 on monday			1
the trial , expected to last through until thursday , will determine whether or not @entity13 - based @entity3 used @entity0 's ' concrete , new and novel ' ideas when it developed the dual - purpose ketchup packets			1
if the jury rules in the @entity23 businessman 's favor and determines @entity3 agreed to pay for the ideas , a separate trial will begin june 10 on how much @entity3 owes @entity0			1
' @entity3 says it did n't use any of mr. @entity0 's ideas — they thought it up all on their own , ' his attorney , @entity27 told the jury			1
' we 're here to tell you that 's not true			0
' @entity27 told @entity32 he ca n't say how much @entity0 is seeking because an expert hired to calculate the sum has n't issued a final report			2
but @entity3 attorney @entity36 said @entity3 owes nothing because the @entity5 owes nothing to the cone - shaped container that @entity0 invented			1
drawings of two versions of that product were shown to the jury , including one with a keyhole - shaped opening that enables a person to dip a french fry into ketchup , while wiping off excess amounts as it 's pulled out of the opening			0
@entity0 is n't claiming @entity3 copied the exact design			1
rather , he contends @entity3 did n't have the idea for a ketchup container that could be dipped into and squeezed until they heard his pitch			2
@entity3 claims the @entity5 grew out of an earlier idea called the @entity59 ' that it shelved in 2006 because it could n't make it cheaply enough the @entity5 grew out of an earlier idea called the ' @entity63 ' that @entity3 began working on in 2002 but shelved in 2006 because it could n't find a vendor to make the throwaway ketchup packets cheaply enough , the company says			1
the packets must be cheap to purchase because fast - food restaurants and others give the packets away for free , @entity36 said			0
prototypes developed in 2006 were keystone - shaped — like @entity3 's iconic ketchup label — and had a peelable top if a customer wanted to dip a fry and a tear - off end so the ketchup could be squeezed , @entity36 said			1
except for the keystone shape , the @entity5 packets are nearly identical			0
but @entity27 insists the idea came from the 44 - year - old @entity0 , who began working in the food industry at 13			0
after working at pizzerias over five years from the time he was 16 , @entity0 launched wok to you , a firm that delivers @entity86 food from 30 different @entity23 - area restaurants			0
' @entity88 been tinkering with condiment packaging since high school , ' @entity27 said			0
when an earlier letter to @entity3 did n't attract attention , he wrote to then - ceo @entity93 in march 2008 and met with @entity3 officials a month later , @entity27 said			2
@entity3 does n't deny the meeting took place , but says the discussions revolved around his hand - held , cone - shaped container designed to keep french fries from dripping ketchup			2
' the ideas that were discussed at that meeting had nothing to do with the @entity5 , ' @entity36 said .			0

@entity0 patented his ' @entity2 ' condiment package in 1997
he claims @entity3 developed its @entity5 ketchup packets after a 2008 meeting in which he showed them his designs
@entity3 claims the @entity5 grew out of an earlier idea called the @entity59 ' that it shelved in 2006 because it could n't make it cheaply enough
a court in @entity13 will decide this week if @entity3 was influenced by @entity0 's concept and could lead to him seeking *compensation*
