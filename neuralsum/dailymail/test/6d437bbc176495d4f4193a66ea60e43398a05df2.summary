@entity0 believes @entity20 ' is costing them a spot in the @entity5 @entity1 are 17th in the @entity24 table and are set to miss out on @entity26 football next year @entity1 supporter @entity27 , known as @entity2 among fellow fans , claims to have introduced @entity29 after he started to sing it in a pub in the late 1980s			1
the hit has become @entity1 's unofficial club anthem and is a regular chant at the @entity35			1
' apparently we get knocked down because the fans have a @entity2 song , ' he said			1
' if the crowd are a little bit intimidating we lose marks due to the behaviour of supporters			2
' but it 's not just the song , it 's when it gets a bit heated here , plus it 's four of five criteria and small margins , it 's officials , players , crowd			2
' if nothing happens you get six points			2
but if someone sings @entity29 , you get four			0
over the course of the year , if you 're consistently marked down , you 're going to be at the bottom end of the table			1
' i do n't think there 's a problem with them singing it			0
it 's crazy from my point of view			0
' @entity70 's @entity69 are top of the @entity24 table and could earn a @entity5 place if they finish top of the pile and @entity76 ’s top flight is within the top three ‘ fair - playing ’ leagues in @entity78 – which it was on the last count			1

this is how the points are calculated : 1			0
red and yellow cards ( @entity94 score = 10 - no minimum score ) teams are deducted points if a player receives a yellow card ( -1 point ) or straight red ( -3 points )			0
this is the only section where teams can receive a score below zero			0
positive play ( @entity94 score = 10 - minimum score = 1 ) @entity16 teams are encouraged to play a positive style of football			1
this section takes into consideration things like time - wasting tactics and positive play			2
respect towards opponents ( @entity94 score = 7 - minimum score = 1 ) this section is designed to encourage players to abide by the spirit of @entity6 and it also includes offences which may have been accidentally overlooked by the officials			0
respect towards the referee ( @entity94 score = 7 - minimum score = 1 ) the @entity16 takes respect towards officials very seriously and players are expected to respect referees - including assistants - at all times			0
positive attitude is rewarded with high marks			0
behaviour of the team officials ( @entity94 score = 6 - minimum score = 1 ) team officials , including managers , are assessed on their behaviour during a match			2
one aspect they are marked on is how they accept the decisions of the referee			0
behaviour of the public ( @entity94 score = 10 - minimum score = 0 ) the section which has angered @entity0 , teams begin with a score of five points but can lose marks for persistent abuse of officials , aggressive conduct towards rival fans and foul and abusive language			1
but @entity0 has criticised the competition , which is designed to promote positive behaviour , and has questioned its merit			1
' the @entity6 table is a waste of time , ' he added			2
' i was always historically at the bottom when i was @entity163 , but then i went to @entity164 and we qualified			0
despite a successful season in the @entity16 this year , @entity0 is n't happy with the @entity6 table ' it 's the perception of the club here that sometimes goes before us			1
' we also have a high amount of yellow cards			0
' @entity173 merits a @entity26 place is open to discussion			2
but it 's a good prize			0
' we 're not going to win it any time soon though are we ? '			0
