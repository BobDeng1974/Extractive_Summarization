historians believe they have raised @entity2 's only surviving ' state pirate ship ' from the bottom of the @entity4 after 400 years			1
most of the time the @entity5 led an honest existence , trading between @entity2 and @entity7 for the @entity8 before it sank fully - laden in a storm in 1603			1
but behind this peaceful image lay a sinister double life - plundering other nations ' traders in ' terrorist ' raids which were signed and sealed by the @entity15 of @entity16			1
find : historians believe they have raised @entity2 's only surviving ' state pirate ship ' from the bottom of the @entity4 after 400 years			1
the wreck ( pictured ) was found 10 years ago with few clues to its identity historic : the wreck was rediscovered in the @entity4 near @entity24 , @entity25 , and is believed to have sunk during a fierce storm in 1603 as it left @entity28 fully - laden with goods to trade with the rest of the world huge : the ship was left in pieces but originally weighed 160 tons and measured 80ft long and 25ft wide the @entity5 was one of 70 ' privateers ' - state pirate ships - which stole £ 97,000 under the reign of @entity37 , more than the famous pirates of the south west put together			1
the spoils were then divided between rich @entity2 sponsors and the courts , which claimed a hefty cut of the winnings as a tax			1
in the case of the @entity5 , the ship travelled to the @entity48 to steal more than £ 2,000 in unspecified ' prizes ' , sugar , hides , ginger , sarsaparilla and brazilwood			1
much of the treasure was owned by merchants from @entity57 , with whom @entity2 was fighting a war that was never formally declared			1
until now historians believed they had never found the remains of any privateers , most of which met grisly ends on the high seas			0
dr @entity66 said the ship likely ' led the double - life of honest trader and ruthless privateer ' but that changed after a 400 - year - old vessel was dug up from the bed of the @entity73 estuary a decade ago in what researchers described as the biggest find since the @entity77			1
after 10 years painstakingly combing over the ship 's mud - caked artefacts and disintegrating beams , archaeologists now say they have strong clues it and the @entity84 were one and the same			2
dr @entity66 , an honorary senior lecturer at @entity86 's @entity85 who led the project , said the similarities were striking			2
both ships were a similar size and age , both sank fully - laden as they left @entity28 , both were armed merchantmen , and both had evidence which pointed to them losing their sails and rudders			1
' i think there 's a very good chance that the @entity101 was actually the @entity5 ' , said dr @entity66			2
' we know the @entity5 was drifting in a peculiar way because it lost its rudder and sails			2
interestingly we did n't find a rudder and our ship was strangely orientated on the sea bed			0
' if our wreck is indeed the @entity5 , then it probably is the first merchantman of that era yet recovered that led the double - life of honest trader and ruthless privateer			1
' @entity117 was state - sponsored terrorism formally sanctioned by the @entity15 of @entity16 , conducted by merchant and private shipping on the high seas - and therefore lying outside the contemporary definition of a declaration of all - out war between two sovereign states			1
' in effect , @entity2 declared war on @entity57 without declaring war on @entity57 , not using expensive armies and avoiding invasions and unwinnable land battles , but by using privately - owned ships sponsored by private backers who would get a cut of the " profits "			1
' the rest was then collected by the @entity138 as a " tax "			0
' reign : the @entity5 was one of 70 ' privateers ' - state pirate ships - which stole £ 97,000 under @entity37 study : divers helped raise the ship 's skeleton from the murky waters around @entity147 near @entity24 , @entity25 , and brought it to @entity149 before samples were sent to be studied in @entity151 and @entity28 big job : a workman carefully unloads one of the huge sections which was raised from the @entity4 fragile : the wreck could not be kept out of the water for long because it would begin to decay in the air careful study : like the @entity5 , the @entity161 ship was aligned unusually on the sea bed ( pictured in diagram ) the historians make clear that they will never be completely sure if they have the right ship			1
port records from the year of the @entity5 's sinking , which would have included its cargo and other details , did not survive and the remains are too disintegrated to prove its origin conclusively			1
but details of its final days were recorded partially in court records , because its owner brought legal action over the sinking after he claimed the estuary channels were not properly marked out			0
and the historians insist the remains were the most important find since the @entity77 was raised from the @entity183 in 1982 , after 437 years			2
the wreck was originally rediscovered by the @entity185 in the 1840s , whose men found and melted down 2,700 lead ingots , iron guns and lead for money without a second thought for its history			0
significant : historians described the find as the biggest since the raising of the @entity77 ( pictured ) , the flagship of @entity199 's fleet which sank in the @entity183 in 1545			0
but it was much more typical of ships of the time similarities : researchers said the ship was similar to sir @entity206 's @entity205 ( replica shown ) clues : the wreck was named the @entity101 after the initials of @entity213 businessman and scholar @entity210 were found on one of its 7ft cast iron guns			2
he helped found the @entity217 in 1571 @entity218 : an emblem of a grasshopper on the gun			0
the ship 's timbers were felled in 1574 , historians believe a crucial part of @entity231 warfare from the 1500s to the 1800s , ' privateers ' differed from pirates in only one way : they were backed by the state			1
during the 19 - year @entity234 , which was never formally declared despite the famed battle with the @entity236 of 1588 , privateers proved a crucial weapon to undermine the enemy			1
the ships would sail near the @entity241 and @entity57 coasts , trying to intercept the treasures of their rivals to assert @entity2 's dominance			1
their methods were every bit as merciless as those of conventional pirates , but their legitimacy meant their captains had no need to fear arrest when they returned home			0
@entity2 was not alone - every developed nation was every bit as ruthless as every other			2
after that , the ship 's existence was largely forgotten until workmen for the @entity263 were dredging the @entity4 in 2003 to build a £ 1.5billion container port in @entity265 , @entity266			1
divers helped raise the ship 's skeleton from the murky waters around @entity147 near @entity24 , @entity25 , and brought it to @entity149 before samples were sent to be studied in @entity151 and at @entity86			2
over several years historians confirmed they had found an armed 16th century merchant ship , weighing 160 tons and measuring 80ft long and 25ft wide with a 60ft keel			0
its timbers were dated to 1574 and it was similar to the @entity205 , the galleon sir @entity206 used to circumnavigate the globe in the 1570s			0
eventually they named it the @entity101 after sir @entity210 , the legendary scholar and gunmaker who founded the @entity217 in 1571 - and whose initials were found on one of the ship 's 7ft cast iron guns			2
unlike the @entity77 , which was much larger and heavier than average ships in the 1500s , dr @entity66 said @entity210 's ship was a typical example of @entity28 merchantmen of its day			1
they traded with @entity296 , @entity57 , @entity297 and @entity298 , exploring the world in perilous conditions			2
some 34 were commandeered to defeat the @entity236 in 1588			0
dr @entity66 said the research had been excruciatingly slow			0
caked in silt : the historians had a painstaking task to work out which artefacts on the ship were worth saving scientific : they used x-rays to discover the identity of each artefact under the sand - in this case a bottle from the captain 's table : the team found this ornate salt cellar concealed under centuries of sediment and silt relics : the researchers chipped away at each of the artefacts from the ship , which were covered in silt ' a lot of the things we found , we did n't know what they were because they had come up covered in sand and gravel , ' he said			2
' we x-rayed them and painstakingly chipped away at the silt until we found what was underneath			0
there were boots , spoons and a salt cellar straight from the captain 's table			0
' the team also found ingots of lead and tin and kentish ragstone ballast in the cargo hold , along with a powder chamber for an iron gun			0
the ship 's oak timbers have now taken their final journey from a @entity355 torpedo testing lake to the @entity356 in @entity357 , @entity358			0
preserved by the water , they are now part of an ' underwater museum ' which can be explored by the site 's 30,000 trainee divers each year			0
the researchers hope to put the artefacts on display at @entity368 in @entity266 from 2018			0
heritage : one of the ship 's 7ft cast iron guns is lowered into a trough to help protect it from the elements final resting place : after long work ( left ) the timbers were lowered into the @entity377 in @entity357 , @entity358 ( right )			0

officially the @entity5 led an honest existence trading with @entity7 in 1500s
but it led sinister double life - stealing more than £ 2,000 as state pirates
tax on treasure filled *coffers* of @entity2 's courts and rich private ' sponsors '
it allowed @entity2 to wage war on @entity57 without formally declaring it
story came to light after 400 - year - old wreck was raised near @entity28 in 2003
experts in @entity28 and @entity151 spent a decade analysing the remains
now they reveal evidence their wreck and @entity5 were one and the same
