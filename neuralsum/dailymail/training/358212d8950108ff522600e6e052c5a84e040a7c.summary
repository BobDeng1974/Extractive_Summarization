by @entity0 published : 06:44 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 09:31 est , 10 october 2012 a disabled boy fell to his death because care home workers were too afraid to restrain him over ' health and safety ' fears			1
@entity6 , 18 , had brain damage and was susceptible to blood clots following treatment for a brain tumour , which was removed when he was eight			2
but despite his medical history and the evident danger , carers at a specialist unit stood by and watched as @entity6 pulled himself up onto a windowsill with his wheelchair still strapped to his back			1
the teenager fell and hit his head - and within hours was dead			2
his family have now received a four - figure payout			1
@entity6 , seen here before his surgery to remove a tumour and left , aged 16 after his treatment , died after he knocked his head whilst carers watched him climb on to a windowsill seen here at @entity29 in 1999 , @entity6 ' life changed dramatically when doctors found a tumour on his brain stem when asked by a coroner why he did not intervene in the moments before the tragedy , one of his carers wrongly stated the home had a ' no restraint policy ' due to health and safety rules			1
following the out of court settlement , @entity6 ’s mother @entity41 said : ' if a toddler ran out into the road , would they have stood by and let them get run over by a car ? ' his carers said they did n’t want to move him or stop him because they were scared they might get hurt , but one of them was a 6ft bouncer - it was simply ridiculous			1
' after the accident , i was told that he had suffered a slight knock but in the inquest i discovered he had received a severe blow to the head			2
' there were three carers in the room at the time and they just stood next to him and watched him for several minutes before he fell			1
' they should have just grabbed him and stopped him from doing it , then my little boy would still be here			0
' a coroner recorded that @entity6 , seen here aged 7 drawing with sister @entity65 , died from bleeding on the brain after the fall @entity67 , seen here at his sister @entity65 's 18th birthday with his aunt @entity70 was ' loved by everyone ' mrs @entity72 added : ' if he had died from the cancer i might have been able to live with that , but knowing his death was preventable has made it impossible for me to move on			1
' after his death , bosses at the @entity79 , in @entity80 , sent his family a £ 12 cheque for @entity6 ’s funeral flowers after the inquest in may			1
now , the home ’s owners @entity87 have agreed to pay mrs @entity72 and her ex-husband @entity88 , 46 , an undisclosed sum , although they continue to deny any responsibility for @entity6 ’s untimely death			1
@entity6 was diagnosed with medullablastoma - a tumour on his brain stem - at the age of eight			0
he underwent surgery and two years of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to treat the tumour			0
@entity6 was left with balance issues and over time his behaviour changed and he would keep his family awake at night , getting out of bed to lie in the @entity101			1
he also suffered a number of health problems including blood clots			1
by october 2008 his behaviour was becoming increasingly difficult for @entity41 and @entity88 , who also have two daughters , @entity106 , 26 , and @entity107 , 17 , to look after			0
by this time , @entity6 was using a wheelchair and following a bout of encephalitis , @entity6 ’s parents made the decision to place him in the @entity79 in the hope the intensive therapy offered there would give him the opportunity to walk again			1
@entity6 , pictured aged 17 with his mother @entity41 , was allowed to climb on to a windowsill while staff watched , the inquest heard @entity41 , who now lives in @entity121 , @entity122 , with her partner store depot worker @entity123 , 47 , said : ' i did n’t want to put him in the unit			1
' but the services they offered seemed perfect for @entity6 and he was so desperate to learn to walk again that i allowed him to go			0
' the managers reassured me that they would keep him safe and i visited him every day			0
' on may 28 , 2009 , @entity41 claims she received a call to say he had received ' a slight knock ' but that he seemed fine and had not been sick			0
the next morning , @entity41 was preparing to visit her son when she received another call to say that staff at the centre had called a doctor to check on @entity6 ' just in case ' and that he had said to monitor him for the next 24 hours			1
a short while later , she received another call to say @entity6 had been sent to hospital in an ambulance			0
as he was taken into @entity140 at @entity141 , @entity6 suffered a massive heart attack and died in his mother ’s arms			0
since then , @entity41 has been searching for answers as to how her son could have been allowed to hurt himself while under the supervision of three carers			2
the room in which three care workers watched as the brain - damaged teenager climbed on to the windowsill she said : ' he was strapped into his wheelchair so i do n’t know how someone who could n’t walk could have pulled himself up onto a windowsill like they said he did			1
' i do n’t care about the money , all i ’ve ever wanted from @entity87 is an explanation and an apology			0
' an inquest in may this year heard how three members of staff were with @entity6 when he pulled himself up on a window frame to try to see a motorbike outside			2
he was still strapped into his wheelchair and the hearing at @entity168 heard his carers tried to persuade @entity6 to climb down but at no point did they physically intervene			1
in evidence , they said there was a ' no restraint ' policy and that health and safety regulations prevented them from stepping in			1
senior care assistant @entity179 told the inquest that he was in the room with @entity6 when he climbed on the windowsill , but he could not physically step in to get him down because of a health and safety policy			1
mr @entity179 said carers were told to talk to patients and distract them from behaving in ways that might cause them to harm themselves			2
his mother @entity41 is devastated at the death of her only son , and has accepted an out - of - court settlement from the care home owners he told the inquest : ' i would stand and observe - maybe a couple of feet away			2
he happened to hear a motorbike starting up			0
@entity6 made his way to the window and proceeded to climb up			0
he was kneeling on the windowsill and he was looking out			2
' i said " look , you need to come down because it ’s dangerous " , but he was distracted by the motorbike			0
' mr @entity179 , who is no longer employed by @entity87 , said he shouted for help			0
coroner @entity205 asked mr @entity179 : ' why did n’t you grab him ? ' mr @entity179 replied : ' health and safety policy states you do n’t catch anyone to break their fall			1
' mr @entity205 asked if that was the firm ’s policy			2
mr @entity179 replied : ' it ’s health and safety policy all over the country , i am led to believe			1
' he told the inquest he was concerned about being injured himself			0
mr @entity179 said : ' i was asking him to come down			0
the back of his head hit the floor			0
everything after that is a bit of a blur			0
' coroner @entity205 recorded a verdict of accidental death caused by bleeding on the brain			0
at the time , he said : ' the issue i find the most difficult to deal with is that for one or two minutes @entity6 was holding on to the window frame with his wheelchair strapped to his back			1
' the staff realised it was dangerous			2
no attempt seems to have been made to take simple action to intervene			2
' @entity6 was being cared for at the @entity79 in @entity80 when he died @entity236 , a senior manager with @entity87 , which owns the unit , said staff should have been trained to physically intervene ' as a last resort '			1
mr @entity205 also said @entity6 ’s care plan meant he should only have been in his wheelchair when being moved around the home , but staff members with him when he fell did not know that			1
he said he was further concerned @entity6 was not always made to wear a protective helmet , as his care plan suggested			0
following the payout , @entity247 , a specialist in medical negligence and care home neglect with @entity251 solicitors said : ' this was a tragic accident that would have been avoided if @entity87 ’s staff had used basic common sense			2
' there were several opportunities that were missed to prevent @entity6 climbing on the window and to get him down safely once he had done so			0
i hope that lessons have been learned and that an awful event like this will never happen again			0
' since the accident , @entity41 has struggled to cope with the grief of losing her only son			0
she said : ' @entity6 went through so much in his life and his death has left the whole family traumatised			2
' i miss him every day			0
he might have had brain damage but he was still smart , he passed a science gcse not long before he died			0
when @entity273 contacted @entity87 a man , who refused to give his name or his position in the company , said they would not be giving any comment on the case and hung up .			1

carers watched as @entity72 climbed on to the windowsill with a wheelchair strapped to him
