by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:17 pm on 4th july 2011 when @entity2 was a toddler she was forced to eat fruit like every other child - but it drove her bananas for more than 20 years			1
now aged 23 and after years of enduring a phobia to bananas she has finally conquered a childhood fear that saw her nauseous at the sight of one			1
her fear became so bad that she could n't bear to be in the same room as the fruit and felt sick if she smelled one			2
