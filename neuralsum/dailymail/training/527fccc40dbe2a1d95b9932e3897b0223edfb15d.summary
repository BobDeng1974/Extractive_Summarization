@entity10 are among several clubs interested in signing the @entity13 striker , who wants regular football away from @entity15			1
@entity0 , who clinched the signing of @entity17 for £ 8million from @entity18 on thursday night , is also keen on @entity19 but the @entity21 striker will not be fit until january and relations between the clubs were soured by a failed swoop for @entity24			1
@entity10 boss @entity0 confessed @entity3 ’s 4 - 0 @entity37 defeat to @entity38 was a handy reminder ahead of tonight ’s @entity41 play - off clash against @entity42 , which @entity10 lead 2 - 1 after the first leg			1
he said : ‘ i was there , i watched the @entity3 game			1
it is a good example for us to be ready			0
we got a good result in @entity49 but we need to be focused			0
’ on the move ? @entity0 is eyeing a loan move for @entity3 forward @entity9 ( above ) @entity52 has been sold to @entity53 but the arrival of @entity56 defender @entity17 means @entity10 are still loaded with centre - halves			1
they now have @entity17 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , who is fit after a back problem and in tonight ’s squad , plus young players like @entity66 and @entity67			1
‘ we need to give balance to the squad , ’ said @entity0 , who is open to making more signings			2
‘ i do n’t talk about names , never			0
i always say not to expect a lot of movement but it is possible that we add some players , yes			0

@entity26 , not in the squad to play @entity42 because of a bad back , is on @entity89 ’s short - list , though the @entity90 appear to be making progress with a loan deal for @entity93 from @entity94			0
@entity95 has emerged as a possible departure , with @entity97 interested in the midfielder			0
@entity59 and goalkeeper @entity99 are the main contenders to replace @entity52 as club captain , though @entity0 will not make a decision until the transfer activity is over			2
safe hands : @entity99 is one of the main contenders to succeed @entity52 as @entity10 captain asked if he wanted to succeed @entity52 as captain , @entity99 said : ' i do n’t really need to wear the armband to feel like a leader for the team			2
i am very proud to the captain for the @entity113 national team			0
' for @entity10 it is just the manager ’s decision			2
i am not expecting something about that , i am just trying to do my job in the best way , and i try to help the team to have the best performance			0
' and after , in the changing room , i know that i have my place , and i try to be an example for everyone , and especially for my young team - mates because in the squad there are a lot of young players			0
