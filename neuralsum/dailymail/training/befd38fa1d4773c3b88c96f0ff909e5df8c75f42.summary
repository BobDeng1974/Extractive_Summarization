so the 23 - year - old booked a consultation at her local council offices to assess her financial situation			1
after totting up the income from her job and tax allowances compared with her outgoings , she was horrified when the official declared : ‘ you ’d be better off on benefits ’			2

she will stick to her traditional values of hard work and wants to set a good example for two - year old daughter @entity35			1
@entity27 also fears that other people with less of a work ethic could just take the softer option			1
she said : ‘ i was disgusted			0
the council adviser should never have said that to me			0
‘ telling some people they are better off on benefits would probably make them give up work			0
‘ i love my job , but it is hard leaving @entity35 when i am getting such little financial benefit from it			1
i do n’t feel any better off in work , but i really enjoy it			0
‘ @entity35 knows that i go to work and help the old people			2
i hope she is proud of me			0
