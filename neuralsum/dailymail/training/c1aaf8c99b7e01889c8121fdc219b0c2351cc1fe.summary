published : 06:19 est , 4 june 2012 updated : 06:28 est , 4 june 2012 when a stray named @entity1 turned up at the council pound , many would have had him down as a lost cause			1
the @entity5 's limbs had been ravaged by arthritis and he looked certain to be put down - until a kindhearted charity worker insisted vets could rebuild him			1
they had the technology and , thanks to the charity 's generosity , they had the £ 12,000 funds			1
now , his joints painstakingly reconstructed , all @entity1 needs is a home			2
close shave : @entity1 shows off his scars and bandages after costly surgery that may well have saved him from being put to sleep nicknamed the ' @entity22 ' , @entity1 was last year diagnosed with multiple orthopaedic problems , including arthritis in both elbow joints			1
@entity26 , who runs the @entity27 , in @entity28 , @entity29 , decided to step in and pay for his operations - shelling out £ 5,500 for each elbow to be replaced			0
now the re-built pooch is looking for a new family after recovering from the surgery			0
mrs @entity26 said : ' a big thank you to everyone who has raised funds for us to make this possible - we really hope that @entity1 can now go on to live a long and pain - free life			1
@entity42 : the homeless @entity5 's mechanical joints have earned him the nickname ' @entity22 ' better , stronger , faster : @entity1 looks as good as new and is ready to be rehomed ' everyone who meets @entity1 comments on what a beautiful dog he is , with a calm , tolerant nature , always happy to see you and play ball			2
' @entity1 is amazing - despite all the pain he must have been in when he first came to the rescue , he still wanted to play ball			2
' he did it by throwing the ball to you , so you could throw it back for him			0
' @entity1 was found as a stray and came to the charity from the council pound having served his statutory seven days			1
if the charity had not taken him in he could have been put to sleep			2
bionic : @entity65 stars in @entity66 he underwent two operations to replace his elbows , one in october last year , and another just under four weeks ago in april			0
the process has been so costly @entity70 claims it is like the 1970s tv series @entity66 , starring @entity65 as the astronaut whose body is rebuilt with state - of - the - art bionic implants after he barely survives a plane crash			0
mrs @entity26 added : ' we are a relatively new rescue run solely by volunteers , who raise funds and give their valuable time			0
' our belief is that once we have taken a dog in , we are committed to providing all the necessary care and treatment a dog needs , only considering euthanasia on medical grounds once every other opportunity has been exhausted			0
