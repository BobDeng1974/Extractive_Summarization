tennis legend @entity0 has opened up about his past during a poignant on - camera journey which traces his remarkable journey from war - torn @entity4 to world @entity6			1
however , the @entity9 documentary for the ' made by ' series has plenty of light moments thanks to @entity0 - otherwise known as ' @entity14 's ' trademark sense of humour			1
this is particularly true when the cheeky tennis player attempts to mimic a true blue @entity19 accent , in preview footage exlusively obtained by @entity21			1
' g'day mate , how ya ' goin ' ? ' he says , semi-convincingly			0
' good on ya , fair dinkum , knackers ! ' he attempts , proceeding to screw his face up and burst out laughing			0
the seven - times grand slam champion and @entity43 favourite grew up in @entity44 at the height of the @entity47 war in the 1990s and hopes the series shows anything is possible			2
' there is something deeper in it , some inspiration that moves people who follow sports but also like to see where you come from , what 's your background , who you 've been shaped by , ' he said			0
' most people see you for who you are right now but not many see the background of the story and the development and obviously my particular story there were a lot of things going on			0
' it was n't that ordinary , i would say , with wars and difficult times while growing up			0
the global premiere was held in @entity76 tuesday night so @entity19 was the first in the world to see the film series the tennis champion is the favourite ahead of the @entity43 which commes on january 19 in @entity76 of his decision to take part in the series , @entity0 said : â€˜ i was inspired to partner with @entity9			1
this is also an opportunity of having such a strong partner to represent my story and myself and who i am ' '' this series shows all the circumstances , all the past obstacles that i 've had to overcome in order to develop and become the world 's best tennis player , ' said the tennis champion ' this series shows all the circumstances , all the past obstacles that i 've had to overcome in order to develop and become the world 's best tennis player			1
' obviously inspiring others who one day want to become professional tennis players or athletes , this is something that we will sincerely achieve with this @entity9 series			1
' for a man who grew up in a war torn country and has since had to work so tirelessly to reach the top , it has never been easy			0
yet evidently the 27 - year - old has never lost his love of fun			0
he has a self - deprecating humour which makes watching his story so endearing			0
' we 're going to have a lot of bloopers ! ' he laughs to the camera , as he prepares to let people see a side of him he has n't shared before			0
the film gives a sweet insight into his true nature , capturing him as he mucks around the film crew , does tricks with his racquet , sings care - freely and using his tennis racquet as a guitar			2
at first , @entity0 's attempt to mimic the @entity19 accent is semi-convincing , but it quickly goes south ! the film gives a sweet insight into his true nature , capturing him as he mucks around the film crew , does tricks with his racquet , sings care - freely and using his tennis racquet as a guitar whilst filming at a @entity4 tennis court from his childhood , @entity0 plays with a pup with childish abandon however , there was a very serious and important reason that @entity0 decided to embark on the project with @entity9			1
he is hoping to inspire a whole new generation of tennis players by returning to his humble hometown and showing just how far he has come			2
it meant @entity0 had to face some tough memories and counts returning to the home of his first - ever coach , the late @entity152 , who discovered @entity0 at age six , as a particularly moving experience			2
@entity0 credited the @entity152 , who also coached @entity155 and @entity156 , for teaching him ' everything i know ' after her passing during the @entity159			0
' going back to @entity152 's house , obviously where i spent a lot of time when i was younger , and not having her there as my host was not easy for me to experience			0
it felt a bit strange , ' @entity0 said before the series release on tuesday night			2
' so making this film series was emotional and there were some tough moments , but generally it was a very positive experience , ' said @entity0 of the @entity9 series ' but i retain the best memories that i could have and i always remember her with a smile and she was one of the most important people in my life			1
' so making this film series was emotional and there were some tough moments , but generally it was a very positive experience			1
' @entity0 , 27 , said it was an honour to be chosen for the series following the great success of a similar production featuring former world no.1 and four - time @entity43 champion @entity185			1
the @entity4 has the chance to surpass @entity187 's and @entity185 's joint open - era record with a fifth crown at @entity190			0
you can watch the films live on the @entity9 ' made @entity194 ' website			2
