by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:46 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:47 est , 22 december 2013 what did you drink at the weekend ? a pre-christmas glass of mulled wine ? a warming mug of eggnog ? over the next couple of days , perhaps you 'll have a @entity10 at breakfast and a cheeky pre-lunch sherry			1
maybe there will even be a @entity14 as you sink into the sofa after downing several glasses of wine with your turkey			0
after all , 't is the season to be merry			0
sober celebration : @entity0 , with his three sons , refuses to drink in front of them but have you ever stopped to think about the effect all this conspicuous consumption of alcohol - inextricably linked , as it is , to both celebration and relaxation - has upon the children in your family ? i was just ten when i stole my first drink at a family wedding in 1983 , but even now i can remember how much i wanted to be a part of this grown - up , glamorous world - one that was accompanied by the clattering of ice and chinking of glasses			1
in a pattern that would continue for the next 20 years - a period in which i became dangerously and excessively reliant on alcohol - i was n't able to stop at one drink			1
while the adults danced , i toured the room looking for more			0
the tables were groaning with glasses of all shapes and sizes			0
i picked up a goblet of @entity53 , the then - ubiquitous sweet @entity55 wine			2
i took my first sip : it tasted like ice - cold apple juice			2
i glugged down the rest and wobbled around the table sipping rum and @entity61 ( more please ) , gin and tonics with a bitter tang ( no thanks ) , and finished at least two glasses of sherry , which tasted like cough syrup			0
nobody seemed to notice , and i wanted to try them all , every drink that i 'd seen adults with , both in real life and the glamorous world of tv			2
it was only staring at the blurred landscape on the car ride home that i became aware of my altered reality and threw up			0
@entity81 blamed it on too much trifle			0
alcohol is everywhere : @entity0 believes his entire generation is bringing up its children to see drink as a part of everyday life had my parents known what i had been up to , i 'd have been severely punished			1
even though i felt ill , i did n't associate this with alcohol - all i remembered was the buzz , the warm contentment			1
we were all a little naive about health in the @entity98 - still smoking , drinking , and eating red meat most nights of the week			1
but in the health - conscious 21st century , with all we now know , you might assume society is more savvy , sensible and strict about children and alcohol			1
in november this year , two shocking pieces of research were published			2
one study revealed that one in five 11 to 15 - year - olds who had drunk alcohol in the previous month said it had been bought for them by their parents			1
meanwhile , @entity116 's top liver disease expert , professor sir @entity117 , reported a ' meteoric rise ' in alcohol - related deaths as a result of young people drinking heavily in their teens			1
' liver specialists are seeing people as young as in their 20s dying due to alcohol , ' he said			1
' if the increase carries on at the same rate , we could see up to a quarter of a million preventable deaths from liver disease in the next 20 years			2
' sadly , i was n't surprised			2
my entire generation is bringing up its children to see drink as a part of everyday life - and at no time more so than at @entity139 , when it 's estimated that the average adult will spend £ 75 on drink			1
alcohol is everywhere and tv advertising , filled with beautiful people happily quaffing drink , is the beating heart of our booze - worshipping culture			1
as a child , my brain was full of slogans : lager that stays sharp to the bottom of the glass , the amber nectar			0
the @entity159 's @entity158 bitter whippet made me laugh , and i wanted to follow the @entity161 lager bear			2
the beer , wine and spirits industry and supermarkets spend £ 800 million a year on tv advertising , which generates a whopping £ 37.7 billion a year in revenue			2
companies promote alcohol as the magic key to affluence , togetherness and fun ; the natural accompaniment for every imaginable family occasion			2
the truth is that alcohol all too easily becomes the enemy of easy socialising			2
it exacerbates depression and having too much causes you to become withdrawn to the point where you can only socialise comfortably by being drunk			2
but children bombarded by advertising images get only one side of the story			0
the problem took off in my parents ' generation			0
raised in the @entity195 , where the only alcohol in the house was a bottle of @entity199 that lived in a cupboard until @entity139 , they regarded drinking as a treat			1
wine was too expensive and the cheap stuff was unpalatable			0
during the @entity98 boom , however , much of the country - my parents included - experienced a boost in household income			1
they could now afford to drink regularly , and with this new affluence came what seemed like a more glamorous lifestyle			0
indoctrinating : alcohol is promoted as a reward that will make grumpy people happy and sad people laugh my favourite childhood memories were watching @entity81 , a teacher , and @entity219 , a director at an engineering firm , spending friday night with our neighbours , mostly professionals and small business owners			1
i remember them laughing as they drank to wind down at the end of the week			0
to a child , the message that alcohol was a reward was clear : it made grumpy people happy , sad people laugh			1
it was a powerful , wordless form of indoctrination			0
i kept drinking sneakily at every family occasion			0
and by the age of 14 , i was adept at helping myself at parties while the adults were n't looking			0
i ca n't remember a time that my school friends or i could n't get our hands on alcohol			1
there was so much booze sloshing around our parents ' homes that no one needed to set foot in an off - licence			1
while we were allowed a small beer or shandy on a special occasion , they would never have expected we would take such liberties with their trust			0
and no one warned us about the perils of alcohol			0
we were lectured on the deadly threat of heroin , but never about the nation 's fix of choice : a drug that kills 10,000 people a year and is responsible for one - third of all hospital admissions			1
by the time i went to college i had no boundaries around alcohol			0
a group of us who drank with equal ferocity would head out for a fry - up on a saturday morning to mop up our hangovers and then wait for the pubs to open again at 11 am			1
of my close - knit circle of five friends , three of us went on to develop alcohol and substance abuse issues in our 20s			1
after college , i continued to drink heavily through the first half of my 20s until i found myself in a doctor 's surgery in 1998 in the grip of a nervous breakdown			1
booze - worshipping culture : the beer , wine and spirits industry and supermarkets spend £ 800 million a year on tv advertising my doctor asked how many drinks are too many and i replied : ' eight ? ' he said : ' one is too many - if you are an alcoholic			1
' of course , i was not a full - blown alcoholic , but did i have a problem with alcohol ? you bet ! so i quit drinking for the next ten years , determined to clean my life up			1
i believe quitting alcohol remains the most important move anyone can make to resurrect their mental and physical well - being			1
the process of recovery means rejecting old habits , staying away from pubs and nightclubs			0
you feel lost and lonely , often			0
the upside is that you see your old self with some clarity			0
i also watched the drinking of my friends sky - rocket			1
i remember attending the @entity139 play at my three - year - old son 's nursery and being offered mulled wine			1
dangerous : there has been a ' meteoric rise ' in alcohol - related deaths as a result of young people drinking heavily in their teens take your children to a toddler 's party and there 's a good chance adults will be offered a glass of wine or a bottle of beer			1
today 's children rarely see adults socialising without a drink			2
we are teaching our children that booze belongs everywhere			0
my wife never saw her parents drink when she was growing up , as they were both teetotal			2
as a result , she has no impulse to do so herself			0
dinner is complete without a bottle of red			0
no birthday party requires champagne			0
after a decade without alcohol , i started drinking again a year ago because i felt healthy enough to do so			1
these days i drink ( and even get drunk ) occasionally with friends , but rarely at home in front of my three sons , aged seven , nine and 11			1
if i want a drink , i have to make a conscious effort to go to the pub. buying wine and beer at the supermarket and putting it in the fridge next to the orange juice normalises an addictive drug			0
it is the surest route to developing a family habit			0
instead , i am a happy , occasional drinker			0
i do n't preach abstinence to my sons , but i do think they need to know the dangers			2
if they ask me about alcohol , i share some of the details that the supermarkets and brewing giants do n't care to mention			2
that alcohol is habit forming ; that it makes you look ropey and old ; and causes physical diseases and mental illnesses in otherwise healthy people			2
the message is this : do as i do - not as i did			0
needless to say , when we sit down to the turkey , they will only see me raising a small glass of wine .			0

@entity0 does n't drink in front of his sons because of alcohol 's *harmful* effects
there 's been a ' meteoric rise ' in the number of alcohol - related deaths
this is because of young people drinking heavily in their teens
a survey reveals that one in five 11 to 15 - year - olds who had recently drunk had had alcohol bought for them by their parents
