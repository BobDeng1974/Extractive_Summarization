one in five people who bought their council home in one of @entity5 ’s wealthiest areas was receiving housing benefit when they applied , it has emerged			1
the revelation centres on the @entity9 borough of @entity10 , and comes after a @entity12 watchdog warned fraudulent purchases under the @entity14 to buy scheme have increased 400 per cent in two years			0
one fear is that hard - up tenants are being ‘ gifted ’ cash by private firms to buy their homes at a cut - price rate			1
in @entity10 , 22 per cent of @entity14 to buy sales were to people in receipt of housing benefit when they applied , dropping to 11 per cent upon completion			0
it begs the question of how council tenants who qualify for housing benefit could suddenly afford to buy properties outright in one of the most expensive parts of the country			2
anyone who has more than £ 16,000 in savings is not eligible for housing benefit			0
a report also found that 31 per cent of former council homes are now owned by private landlords and can be let for more than £ 800 a week in the capital ’s second-most expensive borough			1
councillors have warned of a ‘ property bonanza ’ – and said many tenants claim the money was a gift from overseas , making it near impossible to trace			1
last summer , it emerged that a property company had leafleted 60,000 council house tenants offering six - figure rewards for working with them to buy and then sell their homes			1
councillor @entity65 , anti-fraud tsar for @entity66 - run @entity10 , believes right to buy should stay @entity67 , a director of @entity68 , told an undercover @entity70 reporter that he was making so much money snapping up homes that had been undervalued by the council and selling them on that he would ‘ never have to work again ’			1
the scheme was entirely legal			0
councillor @entity65 , anti-fraud tsar for @entity66 - run @entity10 , told @entity78 ’s @entity77 programme : ‘ i passionately believe right to buy needs to stay , but it needs to be very tightly managed and not fuelling a property bonanza for individuals swanning around estates in grand mercedes and @entity85			2
’ labour - run @entity87 council said @entity14 to buy sales had risen from only a handful to more than 300 since tenants ’ discounts were increased two years ago			1
in some cases , discounts now amount to more than £ 100,000			0
councillor @entity93 told the programme : ‘ it ’s hard – we build them and then lose them via @entity14 to buy which then becomes buy to let			2
’ right to @entity99 was first launched by @entity100 in 1980 to help council tenants get on the property ladder			2
in march 2012 , the government announced it would ‘ reinvigorate ’ the policy , raising the cap on discounts and ensuring that new council homes were built			1
but an @entity109 report last year found right to buy fraud had increased by more than 400 per cent since the reforms			0
@entity10 said it now refers all right to buy applications from tenants on housing benefit to be checked for fraud			0
inside @entity9 will air tonight at 7.30pm on @entity116 .			0
