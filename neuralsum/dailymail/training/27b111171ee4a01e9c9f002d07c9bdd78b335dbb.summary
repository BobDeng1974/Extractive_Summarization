by @entity0 published : 18:17 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 18:24 est , 3 september 2013 @entity3 archaeologists have pinpointed when the original ‘ pharaohs ’ ruled @entity4 for the first time			1
using mathematical models , radiocarbon dating and archaeological evidence , researchers found the first ruler , @entity7 acceded to the throne between 3111 @entity14 and 3045 bc - up to five hundred years later than some previous estimates			1
a new timeline shows the original territorial state developed from primitive beginnings in as little as six hundred years			1
archaeologist dr @entity19 , of the @entity20 , said : ' there are no records before the third dynasty , so we have had to guess exactly when the vital @entity25 , which led to the development of writing and agriculture , happened			2
' samples were taken from the royal cemetery , @entity31 ( pictured ) the pharaohs , who are understood to have started with @entity7 , ruled @entity4 for more than three thousand years and the story of the very last pharaoh , @entity35 , is famous to this day			1
but it will be another thousand years before we are as far removed from her as she was from her earliest predecessors who remain shrouded in legends and conjecture , known only from a handful of frustratingly incomplete sources			0
archaeologist dr @entity19 , of the @entity20 , said : ' there are no records before the third dynasty , so we have had to guess exactly when the vital @entity25 , which led to the development of writing and agriculture , happened			2
' the study , published in the journal @entity49 , also found the @entity51 period when inhabitants along the @entity53 started to form permanent settlements was probably closer to 3700 bc than 4000 bc , with the stone age @entity56 era preceding it lasting longer and finishing later			2
dr @entity19 said : ' the origins of @entity4 began a millennium before the pyramids were built , which is why our understanding of how and why this powerful state developed is based solely on archaeological evidence			1
@entity7 was the first king of the first dynasty his name means ' fighting hawk ' he is thought to be the founder of the capital city at @entity71 his tomb at @entity31 is the largest in the north - western section of the cemetary legend has it he was killed by a hippo another says he was attacked by wild dogs and saved by a crocodile in the @entity84 and as a result , the city of @entity79 was founded ' this new study provides new radiocarbon dating evidence that resets the chronology of the first dynastic rulers of @entity4 and suggests @entity4 formed far more rapidly than was previously thought			1
' aha is believed to have become pharaoh at the age of 30 and ruled until he was about 62			0
legend has it that he was killed by a hippopotamus while hunting			0
his ‘ chief wife ’ was @entity96 , whose name was written on his tomb at @entity31 , but he also had another wife , @entity99 , with whom he became father of @entity101 , @entity4 ’s second king			2
then came @entity103 , queen @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 whose reign began between 2906 @entity14 and 2886 bc. dr @entity19 said they would have ruled over a territory spanning a similar area to @entity4 today with formal borders at @entity115 in the south , the @entity117 in the north and across to the modern day @entity120 in the east			1
until now scholars had relied on archaeological evidence alone , using the evolving styles of ceramics ( pictured ) excavated at human burial sites to try to piece together the timings of key chronological events in the @entity51 period and the @entity25 scientists have pinpointed when the original ' pharaohs ' ruled @entity4 for the first time			1
older ' @entity133 ' are pictured this is the first robust timeline for the first eight dynastic rulers of @entity4 because until now there have been no verifiable records for this period or the process leading up to the formation of the state			1
the chronology of early @entity4 between 4500 and 2800 @entity14 has been reset thanks to more than 100 fresh radiocarbon dates obtained from hair , bone and plant samples excavated at several key sites including the tombs of the kings and surrounding burials			1
@entity4 was the first territorial state to be brought under one political ruler and the new dating evidence suggests this period of unification happened much faster than previously known			1
until now scholars had relied on archaeological evidence alone , using the evolving styles of ceramics excavated at human burial sites to try to piece together the timings of key chronological events in the @entity51 period and the @entity25			0
for example , among the most significant pieces of evidence surviving today are two mud seals excavated at the royal tombs at @entity31 , containing lists in successive order of the @entity25 kings			0
using the fresh radiocarbon dates combined with existing archaeological evidence , the researchers ’ mathematical model pinpointed the likeliest date for each king ’s accession			0
the date for each king is thought to be accurate to within 32 years			0
the data supports a shortening of the @entity182 @entity51 ; the period over which state formation occurred , to between 600 and 700 years			2
' this finding accentuates a contrast with neighbouring southwest @entity189 , where the transition from cereal production to state formation took somewhere between four to five millennia , ' the researchers said			0
' it reinforces the suggestion that , despite their geographical proximity , prehistoric societies in @entity197 and @entity189 followed very different trajectories to political centralisation , ' they added			0
dr @entity202 , co-author and postdoctoral research assistant at the @entity204 , @entity201 said the museum houses human remains from the @entity25 royal tombs of @entity31 , @entity4 , many of which were excavated in the late 19th and 20th centuries			1
' we were surprised to see how well preserved the specimens are			0
preservation of organic materials from hot desert climates is usually poor but we were able carryout radiocarbon dating using organic residue from most of the specimens			0
' he said @entity31 is a key archaeological site for understanding the prehistory of @entity4 as most of the early rulers are buried there			2
' the remains housed at the museum come from the burials of courtiers who were likely sacrificed to accompany their king into the afterlife			0
importantly , this practice was unique to the @entity25 and these remains provide a unique opportunity to gain broad understanding of life during that time			0
’ the @entity233 immediately follows the unification of @entity235 and @entity236 and is generally taken to include the @entity237 , lasting from the @entity238 until about 2686 bc. the capital moved from @entity31 to @entity71 in the @entity25 with a unified @entity4 ruled by an @entity182 god - king , but @entity31 remained the major holy land in the south			1
the hallmarks of ancient @entity182 civilization , such as art , architecture and many aspects of religion , took shape during the @entity251 period.before the unification of @entity4 , the land was settled with autonomous villages but after the first ruler came to power the country came to be known as the two lands , where rulers established a national administration and appointed royal governors			2
the earliest hieroglyphs appear just before this period , though little is known of the spoken language they represent .			0

@entity3 archaeologists found the first ruler , @entity7 acceded to the throne between 3111 @entity14 and 3045 bc - 500 years later than previous estimates
a new timeline shows the original territorial state developed from primitive beginnings in as little as six hundred years
the @entity20 research also shed new light on the origins of @entity4 began a millennium before the pyramids were built
