by @entity0 published : 07:05 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 10:45 est , 16 may 2012 goalkeepers : @entity2 @entity24 has been handed a surprise call - up for @entity44 as @entity45 was made the big - name casualty in @entity50 's 23 - man @entity48 squad			1
@entity25 has also been confirmed as captain for the tournament			1
former @entity48 captain @entity45 has been axed from the line - up - but there is room for @entity17 despite his upcoming court case over his race row with @entity59 's brother @entity58			1
@entity50 , who was only appointed last month to replace @entity60 , revealed his full squad as they head into battle in @entity63 and @entity64			1
as well as including @entity22 winger @entity24 , he also opted to call up another rookie - @entity7 goalkeeper @entity6 , who will battle @entity4 to be @entity2 's understudy			1
@entity6 will go ahead with his wedding on june 2 , which was booked last year when he was n't even considered for international duty			2
@entity23 , @entity21 and @entity30 were handed wide berths in addition to @entity24			0
pointing the way : @entity48 manager @entity50 speaks at his @entity75 press conference the 18 - year - old has started just six @entity78 games for @entity22 and interim manager @entity79 opted against bringing the winger into his squad for the february friendly with @entity83			1
however , he has taken advantage of @entity41 's failure to cement a place in @entity3 's drive for the title			0
it means , barring injury , @entity13 misses out for a second time , having also been axed from @entity60 's provisional @entity93 squad two years ago			0
key names to miss out are @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity42 , who is named as a stand - by			1
you 're in : @entity24 ( right ) and @entity21 we 're in ! @entity31 and @entity26 at the @entity100 for the @entity101 in @entity102 is @entity50 right to axe @entity45 for @entity44 ? @entity16 's @entity104 is also absent despite @entity50 being tempted to hand the veteran a shock recall			1
also on stand - by is @entity37 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
@entity48 are pitted against @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity64 next month as they attempt to reach the final in @entity111 on july 1			2
they meet in @entity112 on wednesday before training at @entity3 's @entity113 ahead of their flight to @entity115 to play @entity116 on the saturday			0
seven days after that , @entity48 face @entity118 at @entity75 - although @entity6 will be missing , having been given special dispensation to leave for his wedding			2
the snub for @entity45 is likely to signal the end of his international career			2
on @entity45 's omission , @entity50 - who was under no pressure from the @entity125 regarding @entity17 's inclusion - said : ' he is a man i respect			1
i had to make a football decision on the basis of what i have seen in recent months			0
it was a hard phone call to make			0
it was based purely on football and nothing else			0
' out : @entity45 , who played in @entity137 's testimonial on tuesday night , will not be selected for @entity44 over doubts about his fitness , while @entity17 is now expected to feature for his country disappointment : @entity45 , who lined - up for @entity16 in tuesday night 's testimonial for @entity137 in @entity142 , will not be going to @entity44 talks were held between @entity17 and @entity50 at @entity12 ’s @entity145 training ground on tuesday - and the @entity48 boss has resolved the issue of having @entity45 and @entity17 in the same dressing room when @entity17 is awaiting trial for the alleged racial abuse @entity58			1
the @entity125 stripped @entity17 of the captaincy , which led to @entity60 quitting as @entity48 manager in february			2
on friday , sir @entity153 did suggest the 33 - year - old was not capable of playing two matches in four days , which might have played a part in @entity50 's eventual decision			2
@entity45 has been a regular for @entity16 this season though and was fit enough to play 45 minutes in tuesda night 's testimonial match for @entity137 in @entity142			0
out : @entity95 in : @entity34 out : @entity96 the defender had made himself available despite the obvious potential for conflict with @entity162 is known to be unimpressed with today 's news though , which is likely to mark the end of his 81 - cap @entity48 career and mean he will never have appeared at a @entity168			0
he was not selected in 2000 , missed out through suspension four years later and was part of an @entity48 squad that failed to qualify for @entity172 under @entity173			0
@entity50 also presented his new employers with a logistical headache when he cancelled next week ’s training trip to @entity177 in @entity102			0
he had already decided to give the @entity12 players involved in saturday ’s @entity180 final the week off , as well as @entity36 , and has now decided it is not worth going .			0
