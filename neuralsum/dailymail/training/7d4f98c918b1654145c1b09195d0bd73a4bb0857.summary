by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 and so , after a quick blast of @entity4 at this evening ’s opening ceremony , it begins			0
a tournament that has been seven problematic years in the making , for a @entity9 team tasked with winning the hearts of a disillusioned nation on a journey that will take them to every corner of this vast country			1
for the people of @entity19 who will do their best to put their political issues to one side over the next four weeks , their hopes rest on the shoulders of two men			1
and a young boy from the region of this huge , bustling , bonkers metropolis			0
another son of @entity53 who dares to walk in the mercurial footsteps of @entity55			2
@entity26 joined @entity25 on stage at last night ’s press conference and if their performance provided any indication of what is to follow , we are in for some wonderful theatre			1
@entity25 ’s opening speech was churchillian			1
‘ to all @entity9 i want to say the time has arrived , ’ he declared			1
‘ this is our @entity33			2
’ @entity26 picked up the theme			2
‘ we want to fulfil the dreams of all @entity9 , which is to win the @entity33			1
’ poster boy : @entity26 is ready to fulfill his @entity9 countrymen 's dreams of winning the @entity33 under the spotlight : all eyes will be on the 22 - year - old @entity76 forward when the tournament begins @entity78 has a @entity9 player gone into a @entity33 in the position @entity26 finds himself this evening			1
‘ look at the 2002 team , ’ said @entity81 , a leading sports columnist here			0
‘ then they had three great players in @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			0
not to mention a great captain in @entity90			0
now , however , there is only @entity26 , and he is only 22			1
he is still a boy , yet he has all this responsibility			0
’ @entity26 is not shying away from it , as his decision to switch from @entity95 to the iconic @entity97 shirt last year demonstrated			1
he will give the shirt he wears tonight to his mother , he said			2
if he scanned a copy of @entity100 here yesterday , he would have seen 12 pages of sports editorial dominated by his image			0
iconic : @entity26 has taken the no 10 shirt previously worn by @entity55 , and will give it to his mother after the game a nation waits : young @entity19 fans wave through holes in the curtains of the team 's final practice session , @entity100 @entity26 - mania ! the young @entity9 's image can be seen on practically every street corner in @entity19 @entity19 admires @entity26 for his blistering speed , not to mention the 31 goals and 22 assists he has managed in just 49 appearances for his country			1
he might now be at @entity76 but it was at @entity53 that the foundations of his fame were built , in the 136 goals in 225 appearances he scored before moving to the @entity126 capital			2
reports of a twisted ankle last week led to a mood of national hysteria			0
only @entity25 even gets close to the number of products @entity26 endorses , with @entity19 ’s manager the face of supermarkets , cars and beer			1
but @entity26 is the superstar			2
it was the four goals he scored in last year ’s @entity140 that convinced @entity9 that here was a player who could take this tournament by storm			1
that event also convinced a pessimistic population that their national team were once again a force to be reckoned with			0
they go into this @entity33 unbeaten at home in a competitive match since 1975			2
watch and learn : @entity26 has scored 31 goals and 22 assists in just 49 appearances for his country marketing gold : @entity26 's name has been associated with every product under the sun , including this @entity162 viral no pressure then : @entity26 , holding up his figurine , have not lost a home game since 1975 two goals tomorrow ? @entity26 looks on during a @entity19 training session ahead of the @entity33 opener @entity25 was seen as the mastermind of a triumph that concluded with a three - goal demolition of @entity172 , and it is why he too is adored			1
‘ @entity25 is more popular today than in 2002 , ’ says @entity81			1
‘ he has given the people hope when they thought the team would do nothing prior to the dismissal of @entity178 at the end of 2012			0
’ one imagines the tragedy that befell @entity25 on tuesday will only heighten the desire to see him succeed			2
news of the death of his nephew in a car accident is said to have left @entity186 , so much so that players — @entity188 among them — went to comfort him before their training session at their @entity193 base on the outskirts of @entity195			2
‘ we have been through some difficult times together , ’ said @entity25 of his family last night			2
‘ but we know that life goes on			0
i find strength from working with these players			0
even when we are feeling sad , we can forget sadness and feel the beauty around us			0
’ no wonder they call him @entity25 ( @entity205 )			0
devoted following : @entity25 was comforted by @entity188 after the loss of his nephew @entity205 : @entity25 is loved and respected by all the players in the @entity19 squad golden boy : @entity26 of @entity19 celebrates scoring the opening goal of the @entity211 @entity213 presence : @entity19 hope that their football will overshadow protests against the tournament final countdown : @entity19 players go through the paces in their last training session before facing @entity30 the politics surrounding this tournament have nevertheless done the hosts no favours			1
the tournament , as the angry demonstrations have highlighted , is a political hot potato , the staggering expense of staging the tournament causing much of the anger			0
indeed , when @entity19 was awarded the @entity33 in 2007 , polls suggested around 80 per cent of @entity9 were in favour of hosting football ’s greatest extravaganza			1
now that figure is below 50 per cent			0
one way of appeasing the masses has been to take the team round the country over the next month			0
their journey begins here in the south - east , in @entity100 , then heads north - east , to @entity243 , before moving to the central west area , to @entity245			0
only if they reach the final do they even play in @entity195 at the @entity249			0
but their group games alone will see them cover 2,436 miles , compared to @entity252 ’s 430 miles			0
on target : @entity25 and assistant watch @entity26 practice his trademark free - kicks hair today , play tomorrow : @entity25 gives instructions while @entity258 's @entity257 looks on @entity9 of @entity259 : @entity30 players train ahead of their meeting with hosts @entity19 it 'll be alright on the night : @entity26 appeared relaxed in his final press conference , despite the pressure those fortunate enough to witness the beginning of that journey inside the @entity267 this evening will be supporting a team built on swift attacks and a philosophy of high - intensity , high - pressure marking , with @entity274 in the role of midfield enforcer			1
in the newspapers yesterday much of the debate was centred around the fact that @entity19 trained on tuesday on a small pitch to prepare for @entity30			1
known here as ‘ the @entity9 of @entity259 ’ , @entity30 are respected for their speed and touch and @entity25 thinks neat , one - touch football is the way to combat them			1
a goal or two from @entity26 would also be useful			0
talking tactics : @entity290 shows how @entity19 will go about trying to win their opening game			1

@entity19 's @entity33 hopes rest on two men - @entity25 and @entity26
@entity9 coach @entity25 says ' it is time ' for @entity19 to win the @entity33
@entity19 have won a record five @entity301 , the last under @entity25 in 2002
@entity26 is carrying the expectation of a nation on his shoulders
@entity26 has taken @entity55 's iconic no 10 shirt and will give it to his mum
the 22 - year - old has scored 31 goals in 49 *international* *appearnces*
@entity25 is respected by all @entity9 , especially after his nephew 's death
@entity19 face @entity30 in the tournament 's opening game on june 12th
