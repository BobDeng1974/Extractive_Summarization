by @entity0 published : 16:54 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 17:04 est , 30 september 2013 when rower sir @entity2 won his fifth olympic gold medal in @entity5 he had a secret stash on - board with him			1
sellotaped to the inside of his boat were some sachets of sugar			2
this was n't just in case he got hungry			1
it was there if his blood sugar dropped too low			2
for just three years earlier , in 1997 , @entity2 , who at the time was an impressive 6ft 5in and 16st , was told he had type 2 diabetes			1
' i suddenly thought , “ what if something happens out there ” - sugar was the only thing i could grab quickly , ' he recalls			2
heroic : @entity2 saluting his support after winning his fifth consecutive gold medal at the @entity29 in 2000			1
sir @entity2 stashed sugar on board with him ' as it turned out i did n't need it and i forgot all about it until the boat was packed up and brought back to a museum here , and the guys who unwrapped it called me asking why there was sugar there			1
' type 2 diabetes is normally associated with obesity and a couch potato lifestyle - not heroic athleticism			1
even now no one can tell for sure why he developed it - but it could be that it was unlucky genes			2
' my paternal grandfather was diagnosed with it in his late 70s but died soon after of an unrelated matter , ' says sir @entity2			1
' it seemed to skip a generation , because neither of my parents got it - it just seems to be me			2
' there are 3.8 million people with diabetes in @entity64 and 90 per cent have type 2 diabetes like sir @entity2			1
while type 1 is caused when the cells that produce the hormone insulin are destroyed , type 2 diabetes occurs when the insulin produced becomes less effective - normally as a result of being overweight and inactive			1
the body needs more and more insulin to try to keep blood sugar within a normal range			2
although the biggest risk factor for type 2 diabetes is weight , genes can also have an important role			1
' genetics are more important in defining your risk of type 2 diabetes than in type 1 diabetes , ' says professor @entity86 , emeritus professor of medicine and consultant physician , @entity91 and @entity92			1
' if one parent has type 2 , then you have a 30 per cent chance of developing it			1
if both parents do , then that risk is 50 per cent			2
it is possible to develop type 2 diabetes even if you are of a normal weight - just because of the genetics you inherited			1
' diabetic : sir @entity2 's paternal grandfather was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes , but the only other person in the @entity2 family to get it thus far has been @entity2 diabetes @entity64 estimates that as many as 850,000 people have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes and seven million people in this country are at risk of type 2 diabetes and do n't know it			1
' unfortunately , at the moment 50 per cent of people have a complication of the disease by the time they are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes , ' says @entity125 , a clinical adviser to charity @entity127			1
the condition causes complications such as nerve damage , heart disease , kidney damage , stroke , sight loss and amputation - diabetes is the leading cause of amputations and blindness in @entity64			1
and these do n't just strike people who fail to manage their condition ; they affect even the most vigilant of patients			1
a few years ago sir @entity2 lost a friend to the disease			1
' he stepped on a thorn and his foot went black and rather than tell anyone he kept his socks on at night so that even his wife would n't see , ' he says			2
he had to have his lower leg amputated and ultimately it killed him			2
' professor @entity86 adds : ' unfortunately most people - even if their condition is well controlled - will have some complications			1
' now sir @entity2 is just starting to suffer from complications			1
' i get my eyes checked every year , ' he says			2
' i am told there is just the beginnings of a slight change to my eyesight			0
' this damage is thought to have been caused by high blood sugar levels damaging vessels in the eye			0
' i 'm not aware of it yet and it 's nothing that will cause any problems in the near future , but it 's something that i need to be aware of , ' he adds			1
but he does have signs of nerve damage			0
' i go to see a diabetic specialist every six months and have tests on my feet , and they are not as sensitive as they used to be , ' says sir @entity2			1
' there 's a slight sensation of numbness - a bit like when the anaesthetic wears off after you have been to the dentist			1
' i feel that if you stuck something sharp in my toe , i would not feel it as keenly as if you stuck it into my hand			0
complications of this are something i worry about , but i think it 's better to keep aware of them			1
' the disease tends to come on slowly and many ignore the early symptoms			0
' most of the early symptoms are vague and non-specific - such as increased thirst , passing more urine than usual , excessive tiredness and slow - healing cuts and grazes , ' says @entity125			0
sir @entity2 was diagnosed 16 years ago after feeling unusually thirsty one day after training			1
' i drank around four to five pints of fluid and still did n't feel as if my thirst was quenched and i thought , “ that 's a bit strange ” , ' he recalls			2
' i get my eyes checked every year			0
i am told there is just the beginnings of a slight change to my eyesight			0
i 'm not aware of it yet and it 's nothing that will cause any problems in the near future , but it 's something that i need to be aware of			2
' he 'd been given dip sticks to check for sugar in the urine as part of a team medical check			0
' they 'd always come back negative			0
i thought i 'd check it again and this time it was positive - so i phoned my wife , who is a doctor , and she said , “ you better go to your doctor			0
” ' a further blood test confirmed that his blood sugar reading was sky high - 32 - more than three times what it should be			0
he saw a specialist later that day			0
' i was thinking that my career was over			0
i was being quite matter of fact about it - i thought , well i have got four gold medals , that 's pretty good , ' says sir @entity2			1
' then i went to see the specialist who said , “ i can see no reason why you ca n't continue with what you want to do for three years ”			0
what i did n't know was he had no idea how we were going to do that			0
' normally , diabetics are advised to follow regular eating patterns and try a standard low glycaemic index ( @entity254 ) diet - i.e. , foods which release energy slowly			0
however , sir @entity2 's lifestyle made this extremely difficult			1
' i needed around 7,000 calories a day to keep me going through four or five training sessions a day and used to eat a lot of carbohydrates , and things like doughnuts , ' he says			0
' on this new low - gi diet i would wake up feeling great , then my energy would suddenly run out - it was like switching a light off			0
so my specialist put me back on my old diet			0
' this meant experimenting with his insulin levels - he injected eight to ten times a day after meals - and it took months before he got it right			0
while training in @entity278 he hit a low			0
' there were 16 of us there and each session we did i was coming bottom out of everyone - i had never been bottom in my life before			0
fatigued : on sir @entity2 's low - gi diet , he would wake up feeling great but then his energy would suddenly run out ' i called my wife who had wanted me to retire after the @entity292 in 1996 and said , “ i ca n't do this , i 'm coming home ”			1
but she surprised me by saying , “ yes you can , we will find a way ”			0
' sure enough he did - with the sugar stash just in case			2
but after winning his fifth gold at the 2000 games he quit professional sport and had to change the way he managed his diabetes again			2
' it was like starting all over again , ' he says			0
' i was n't burning off the blood sugar like i had been and i had to take a lot more insulin			0
' six years ago he switched to a pump which is occasionally used by type 2 diabetics			1
the size of a pack of cards , it is usually worn on a belt and contains insulin which runs down a tube with a needle on the end			0
the needle is inserted into a fatty part of the body - in sir @entity2 's case the abdomen			1
he inserts the needle himself			0
' it 's great - you only have to inject yourself once every three days when you change the insulin and you can take if off when you go into the shower , ' he says			2
sir @entity2 's attitude to his diabetes has always been ' it lives with me , i do n't live with it '			1
he says : ' you do n't have to be wrapped up in cotton wool			0
yes there are jobs you ca n't do - you ca n't be a pilot and you ca n't join the @entity342 - but you can still reach your goal like i did			0
' ok , i would prefer not to be checking my blood sugar all the time and wearing this pump , but i have no choice - i just have to get on with it			0
' to check your risk , go online at diabetes.org.uk / risk or visit your pharmacist or gp .			0

*3.8million* people in @entity64 have diabetes ; 90 *%* have type 2 diabetes
the latter is normally a result of being overweight and inactive
but genetics can also play a role , as in sir @entity2 's case
