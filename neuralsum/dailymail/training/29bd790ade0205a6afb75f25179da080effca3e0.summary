a thumping victory over @entity1 was probably how @entity2 imagined his 28th birthday would go , except he probably pictured himself among the goalscorers			0
or on the pitch , at the very least			0
it was painful for @entity2 to watch @entity7 thrive in his absence , but there was one crumb of comfort			2
@entity12 scored two and created two for @entity13 , while the @entity14 made one of @entity12 ’s goals and also played in @entity17 to round off an emphatic victory			1
@entity14 superstar @entity13 chips the approaching @entity1 keeper to fire in the first of his brace on saturday @entity12 runs away in celebration having doubled @entity7 's lead in the second - half at @entity1 @entity13 joins @entity17 and @entity12 in celebration as the @entity27 club cruises to three @entity29 points at @entity1 @entity7 defender @entity30 roars in delight having given @entity33 's side a first - half lead @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity35 ; @entity2 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 , 61 ) ; @entity41 ( @entity40 , 70 ) , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ; @entity45 , @entity46 subs not used : @entity48 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 booked : @entity53 , @entity38 , @entity52 sent off , @entity45 , @entity46 @entity7 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity54 ; @entity55 , @entity30 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 , 70 ) ; @entity59 ( @entity60 , 72 ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 , 70 ) , @entity63 ; @entity17 , @entity12 , @entity13 subs not used : ter @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity2 , @entity67 goals : @entity30 36 , @entity12 pen 54 and 88 , @entity13 69 , 71 , @entity17 90 +2 booked : @entity57 , @entity61 referee : @entity71 attendance : 28,235 the connection between the two @entity74 is @entity7 ’s strongest link and @entity2 will note how much that link has developed this season , whereas last season they were rarely on the same wavelength			1
as well as benching @entity2 , @entity33 also left @entity79 out of the squad to save him for the @entity82 clash with @entity83 on wednesday , a bold move considering the @entity86 's form in recent weeks , that said , in the two cup matches against @entity33 's team earlier this month @entity1 shipped a total of nine goals			1
added to the 3 - 0 win @entity7 recorded on the first day of the season , the hosts were a total of 12 - 0 down against the @entity27 giants coming into this game , so it was n't that risky a decision			1
@entity100 went close early on , volleying narrowly over the bar after a well - worked free kick on the right			0
@entity12 went close with a direct effort from a similar position , the ball whistling past the top right corner			2
at the other end , @entity54 was called into action twice in quick succession , with @entity52 denied by the @entity111 after being played in by @entity46 , and again from a free kick			0
the @entity7 starting @entity113 pose for a photo before taking on @entity29 minnows @entity1 on saturday evening a glum @entity2 has to settle for a space on the @entity7 bench on his 28th birthday and did n't feature @entity7 forward @entity13 was in fine form as the @entity27 giants cruised past @entity1 6 - 0 on saturday @entity46 of @entity1 tries to hold off the challenge of @entity56 during the @entity29 clash on saturday but @entity7 began to turn up the pressure and @entity12 's brilliant cross found @entity13 at the back post , but the @entity14 uncharacteristically fluffed his lines			1
@entity30 made no such error when a clever quick free - kick by @entity59 found him on the left - hand side of the six - yard box			1
he chested the ball down and then lashed it past @entity35			0
@entity30 's story of redemption has mirrored @entity7 's own upturn in form in recent weeks			1
this was the sixth game since @entity138 ' @entity137 sunk the blaugrana at @entity140 , and the sixth victory			0
@entity12 , who scored twice at @entity1 , was back to top form for @entity7 as they cruised to a 6 - 0 win @entity144 ( right ) of @entity1 competes for the ball with @entity63 of @entity7 during the @entity29 tie the centre - back has played a key part in the winning streak , after a start to the season that was notable only for glaring errors both off and on the pitch			1
@entity30 has really started to focus though , and it 's paying dividends for @entity7			1
@entity1 have been playing better themselves in recent weeks , matches against @entity7 aside , beating @entity157 and @entity158			0
they never looked like changing their poor form against @entity7 at the @entity160 though , and @entity12 doubled his side 's lead from the penalty spot after @entity13 was fouled by @entity37			1
the @entity164 missed a penalty against @entity83 in midweek , the 14th time he has failed from the spot in his career , but made no mistake here			0
he waited for @entity35 to waver and coolly slotted into the bottom left corner			0
@entity7 talisman @entity12 steps up to slot away his second - half penalty as the @entity27 giants won 6 - 0 the @entity7 squad swarm around @entity13 ( centre ) who was in fine form , scoring twice at @entity1 @entity12 carries out his trademark celebration , pointing to the sky , after his second in @entity7 's 6 - 0 win when @entity52 was sent off for a second yellow card midway through the second period , it was clear the game was up for @entity1			1
in truth , it had never really begun			0
@entity12 continued his hot streak , playing in a more central role , with @entity17 on the right and @entity2 on the bench			0
like at the start of the season , his focus in this position was to create for his team - mates instead of trying to score himself			0
that was evidenced by the two goals he set up for @entity13			0
he slid the @entity14 in for his first and then , three minutes later , played a gorgeous chip over the top for @entity13 to bag the fourth for @entity7			2
@entity13 celebrates another @entity7 goal as the @entity14 linked up superbly with @entity12 in attack once again the @entity7 attack celebrate once again during the 6 - 0 demolition of @entity1 on saturday afternoon there were other sublime contributions from @entity12 , one similar lofted through - ball for @entity57 headed back towards @entity13 , but the forward could n't beat @entity35 to the ball			1
@entity12 eventually scored from open play towards the end , with @entity56 's perfectly weighted pass coming in to the @entity217 's lightning - quick feet			2
a quick shimmy by @entity12 and a low , stroked finish , and the ball was nestled in the helpless @entity35 's bottom - right corner			2
finishing the rout off in stoppage time , making it 18 - 0 to @entity7 over the season and probably rubbing salt in @entity2 ’s wounds , was @entity17 , the man who took the @entity229 ’s place , tapping home at the back post after a brilliant solo dribble by @entity13			1
@entity2 is set to return on wednesday against @entity83 , but the pressure on his shoulders will be greater than ever			0
@entity17 , a second - half substitute , runs away in celebration after scoring a goal in stoppage time at @entity1			2

defender @entity30 fired @entity7 ahead with a smart first - half volley
@entity12 's brace and @entity13 double complete comprehensive win
win keeps @entity33 's side within one point of rivals @entity248
@entity29 leaders @entity248 beat @entity251 2 - 1 earlier on saturday
