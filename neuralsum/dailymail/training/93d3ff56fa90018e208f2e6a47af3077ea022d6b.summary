a letter from the @entity15 in @entity16 , dated november 5 , 2012 , states that the research facility installed devices made by @entity19 , based in @entity20 , @entity11 , according to a copy seen by @entity22			2
@entity23 began as a joint venture between @entity11 's @entity25 and @entity26 , a @entity6 tech firm , and was once called @entity27			1
@entity28 acquired the firm in 2010			0
the discovery raises concerns about procurement practices by @entity6 departments responsible for national security			1
the @entity6 government and @entity36 have raised concerns about @entity25 and its alleged ties to the @entity11 military and government			2
the company , the world 's second - largest telecommunications equipment maker , denies its products pose any security risk or that the @entity11 military influences its business			1
@entity3 was formed as joint - venture between @entity25 , a @entity11 company previously barred from owning an @entity6 corporation because of the risk to @entity6 's national security under scrutiny : @entity54 chairman @entity53 , @entity55 , left , discuss a year - long probe of @entity11 's two leading tech firms , @entity25 and @entity58 the @entity54 's ranking @entity59 , rep. c.a. " @entity63 " @entity60 , ( pictured on right ) talks about a report that says , among things , that @entity66 , ' can not be trusted ' switches are used to manage data traffic on computer networks			1
the exact number of @entity11 - made switches installed at @entity15 , how or when they were acquired , and whether they were placed in sensitive systems or pose any security risks , remains unclear			1
the laboratory - where the first atomic bomb was designed - is responsible for maintaining @entity6 's arsenal of nuclear weapons			1
a spokesman for the @entity15 lab referred inquiries to the @entity84 's @entity83 , or @entity83 , which declined to comment			2
no risk : @entity25 's vice president of external affairs @entity88 has argued that @entity90 products contain no security risks to the @entity6 the november 5 letter seen by @entity22 was written by the acting chief information officer at the @entity15 lab and addressed to the @entity83 's assistant manager for safeguards and security			1
it states that in october a network engineer at the lab - who the letter does not identify - alerted officials that @entity90 devices ' were beginning to be installed in ' its networks			2
the letter says a working group of specialists , some from the lab 's counter intelligence unit , began investigating , ' focusing on sensitive networks			0
' the lab ' determined that a small number of the devices installed in one network were @entity90 devices			0
two devices used in isolated cases were promptly replaced , ' the letter states			0
the letter suggests other @entity90 devices may still be installed			0
it states that the lab was investigating ' replacing any remaining @entity90 network switch devices as quickly as possible , ' including ' older switches ' in " both sensitive and unclassified networks as part of the normal life - cycle maintenance effort			2
' the letter adds that the lab was conducting a formal assessment to determine ' any potential risk associated with any @entity90 devices that may remain in service until replacements can be obtained			0
' ' we would like to emphasize that ( @entity15 ) has taken this issue seriously , and implemented expeditious and proactive steps to address it , ' the letter states			0
on the record : @entity88 speaks to reporters after a @entity54 meeting concerning the @entity54 's report on the security threat posed by @entity11 telecom companies to @entity6 national security corporate filings show @entity25 sold its stake in @entity90 to @entity26 in 2007			1
nevertheless , @entity90 's website still describes @entity25 as one of its ' global strategic partners ' and states it is working with it ' to deliver advanced , cost - efficient and environmental - friendly products			0
' the @entity15 letter appears to have been written in response to a request last year by the @entity155 for the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) to report on any ' supply chain risks			2
' in its request , the committee said it was concerned by a @entity159 report last year that found a number of national security - related departments had not taken appropriate measures to guard against risks posed by their computer - equipment suppliers			1
the report said federal agencies are not required to track whether any of their telecoms networks contain foreign - developed products			2
the @entity155 ( pictured ) has asked the @entity84 to evaluate whether it , or any of its major contractors , were using technology produced by @entity25 the @entity155 specifically asked the @entity84 to evaluate whether it , or any of its major contractors , were using technology produced by @entity25 or @entity58 , another @entity11 telecoms equipment maker			0
@entity58 denies its products pose any security risk			2
in 2008 , @entity25 and private equity firm @entity174 were forced to give up their bid for @entity26 after a @entity6 panel rejected the deal because of national security concerns			1
three years later , @entity25 abandoned its acquisition of some assets from @entity6 server technology firm @entity183 , bowing to pressure from the @entity185			0
the committee evaluates whether foreign control of a @entity6 business poses national security risks			1
much at risk : the @entity11 - made switches were discovered in the network infrastructure of @entity15 , which manages @entity6 's arsenal of nuclear weapons in october , the @entity54 issued an investigative report that recommended @entity6 government systems should not include @entity25 or @entity58 components			1
the report said that based on classified and unclassified information , @entity25 and @entity58 ' can not be trusted to be free of foreign state influence ' and pose ' a security threat to the @entity6 and to our systems			1
' @entity88 , @entity25 's vice president of external affairs in @entity204 , said in an email to @entity22 : ' there has never been a shred of substantive proof that @entity25 gear is any less secure than that of our competitors , all of which rely on common global standards , supply chains , coding and manufacturing			0
' blackballing legitimate multinationals based on country of origin is reckless , both in terms of fostering a dangerously false sense of cyber-security and in threatening the free and fair global trading system that the @entity6 has championed for the last 60 - plus years			0
' he referred questions about @entity90 products to @entity28			0
an @entity28 spokesman said @entity25 no longer designs any @entity90 hardware and that the company ' became independent operationally ... from @entity25 ' several years prior to @entity28 's acquisition of it			0
he added that @entity28 's networking division " has considerable resources dedicated to compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements involving system security , global trade and customer privacy			0

exact number of the switches within the labor 's network infrastructure is *unknown*
at least two @entity11 - made ' components ' removed from the network
@entity11 manufacturer *insists* its products pose no security threat to the @entity6
