many women say they have always wanted to get married but have never found the right man			0
now a 31 - year - old filmmaker from @entity3 has got around the problem but tying the knot to herself			1
@entity6 had been single for six years when she decided to organise the unorthodox ceremony on her own			2
@entity6 says organising a ceremony ' centred on herself ' and making personal vows was empowering she proposed to herself on a park bench , bought a ring and a dress and invited all of her friends to watch her make her vows			1
ms @entity6 told the @entity16 : ' the day was obviously centred on me , the final event being a mirror for me to kiss , but it also felt like i was sharing something very special with my friends , giving everyone an opportunity to reflect on their own ideas of love and commitment			1
' i had one friend in her 50s who said it was one of the best weddings she â€™d ever been to			0
' ms @entity6 says she was partly inspired by the @entity34 song , @entity35 , which includes the lyric : ' i 'm @entity35 , married to myself			1
' she admitted at the time she decided to hold the event , a relationship with another person ' seemed like too much hard work '			0
thinking about the song lyric while sitting on a bench overlooking @entity3 in a romantic part of @entity45 last november , she decided to pop the question			1
she said her parents ' took it in their stride ' and her grandmother , who has since died , told her she ' always thinks of something new '			0
the ceremony was completed when ms @entity6 kissed herself in a mirror before celebrating with friends despite some friends commenting that the idea was ' a bit narcissistic ' , others welcomed the plan and another pal who has recently qualified as a celebrant agreed to officiate			1
after ms @entity6 overcame pre-wedding doubts , 50 people attended the ceremony in a rural farmhouse in @entity66 , which was donated by a friend for the occasion			2
they witnessed her complete a number of traditions , including making vows to herself , put a ring on her finger and throw a bouquet over her head			2
her sister was the only family member present for the event , due to logistical reasons			0
although her wedding is not recognised in the eyes of the law , she hopes her ' incredibly empowering ' actions will inspires other single men and women .			0
