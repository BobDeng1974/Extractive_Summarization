rise of the machines : with internet access becoming cheaper and more accessible , ' internet - use disorder ' will be classified as a mental illness from next may , the internet - use disorder will be listed as as a condition ' recommended for further study '			1
the addiction is said to be part of the fall - out over the ' always on ' mentality that has engulfed many countries over the last decade , with the prevalence of cheap access and the rise of the smartphone			1
psychiatrists warn of rising numbers of children becoming addicted to games @entity41 from @entity42 , who helped author the @entity16 submission , told the @entity6 that , once more research is invested in the disorder , it will allow health professionals to diagnose children with addictive behaviours from technology over-use , leading to the correct treatment			1
he said : ' with kids , gaming is an obvious issue			1
but overall , technology use could be a potential problem			1
' another psychologist , @entity57 , who runs a video game addiction treatment clinic in @entity59 , said he was concernedcbecause of what he saw as growing demand from frustrated parents and damaged children			1
he said he was seeing clients as young as 12 addicted to the internet and video games			1
'' the most typical sign of addiction is anything that looks like withdrawal symptoms , '' he said			1
' so any expression of distress , frustration , irritability when they do n't get to play			2
'' he added that 70 per cent of his clients were children and teenagers and added : ' a lot of kids i have coming into the clinic have difficultly in being able to tolerate distress without zoning out via the internet or via the games			1
' psychiatrist @entity87 gave a note of caution to the newspaper , saying : ' i think [ it ] can be dangerous in not learning how to pay attention in a focused way , but in balance there is nothing wrong with technology			2
' many of us struggle to go more than a few minutes without checking our email inboxes			2
but new research suggests ignoring messages altogether can reduce stress by having a positive effect on the heart			2
scientists who attached heart rate monitors to office workers found they remained in a state of ' high alert ' throughout the day if they had constant access to email			2
now @entity115 informatics professor @entity114 has given her verdict on email after running an experiment in which 13 volunteers ignored their ' you 've got mail ' chimes for five days			2
she said : ' we could n't see a discernible trend on days 1 and 2			0
but at day 5 , the pattern started to become clear : people became less stressed after being away from email			0
' we used monitors that measured the heart rate and also the intervals between heartbeats to obtain a common measure for stress called heart rate variability			0
' people reported that they were more productive			0
they said they were able to focus on tasks longer			0
that was borne out by the data			0
' on average , people with email switched windows about 37 times per hour			0
without email , that was cut in half to 18 times per hour			0
' with email , they spent an average of 394 seconds on any particular window			0
that went up to 568 seconds without email			0
this may not seem a lot , but in the world of multitasking it 's a huge difference			0
people said they felt liberated , and the euphoria lasted for a few days			0
they really tried very hard to make a change			0
but then everybody reverted back to their old ways .			0
