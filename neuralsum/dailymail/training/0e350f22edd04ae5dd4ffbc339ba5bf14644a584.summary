by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 19:56 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 21:05 est , 12 december 2013 education secretary @entity3 accused university bosses yesterday of ‘ pandering to extremism ’ by endorsing the compulsory segregation of audiences for campus visits by hard - line @entity10 speakers			1
he said it was ‘ a disgrace ’ for @entity18 to support the policy of separating men from women at lectures and debates			1
mr @entity3 told the @entity19 : ‘ we should not pander to extremism			0
speakers who insist on segregating audiences should not be indulged by educators , the divide : separate ways in for the different sexes at a @entity27 university debate ‘ this guidance is wrong and harmful			0
@entity18 should withdraw it immediately			1
’ @entity18 – an umbrella body representing university vice-chancellors – caused further controversy yesterday , when its chief executive @entity32 said @entity34 women were ‘ comfortable ’ being separated from men during talks by @entity10 clerics on @entity39 campuses			1
commenting on @entity40 , she said colleges must ‘ respect ’ the views of extremists who want segregation during lectures			2
‘ if people feel more comfortable about sitting separately , and that ’s invariably the situation that will arise in these cases , then universities have to listen to those views , ’ she added			1
‘ what is very uncomfortable about this argument is you are assuming that we have the right to impose views on participants			0
if the participants say this is how they want it to be , it is not appropriate for us to disregard their views			0
’ however , @entity18 was yesterday unable to provide any evidence that most @entity34 women were happy to sit separately			1
and the pressure group @entity67 said the opposite was true , citing a 2008 @entity70 poll which showed that nine out of ten @entity34 students thought segregation was unacceptable			1
female students and campaigners yesterday told the @entity19 they had been incensed when they arrived at events to find they had to sit separately			1
a report produced this week by @entity67 found that out of 180 visits by @entity10 speakers to @entity39 universities over a 12 month period , 46 lectures at 21 institutions have insisted on segregated audiences			0
women were , in most cases , forced to enter the room from a separate door and to sit at the back			0
analysis carried out by anti-extremist group @entity67 found that over a 12 - month period , 46 university events explicitly promoted separate seating for men and women or female - only events			2
among those was an @entity100 debate held at @entity101 in march , at which students claimed security staff tried to move those who would not comply			0
during the debate , organised by the @entity105 and @entity106 , women were told to sit at the back of the room			0
at the @entity112 , separate entrances for ‘ brothers ’ and ‘ sisters ’ were in operation for the @entity10 debate , ‘ @entity115 ? ’			2
a lecture called @entity117 , advertised by @entity119 ’s @entity118 , stated it would be ‘ fully segregated ’ in promotional material			2
and two events held at the @entity123 during @entity124 were promoted on @entity125 stating ‘ segregation will be provided to the best of our abilities ’			2
student rights say gender segregation has occurred despite all 21 of the universities having equality and diversity policies in place			0
some lectures barred women totally , making them watch proceedings from another room via a television feed			0
@entity141 , of student rights – which monitors extremism on campuses – said : ‘ @entity18 has decided the religious freedom of a radical speaker is more important than a woman ’s rights to sit where she wants in a room			1
’ @entity151 , 33 , founder of counter-extremism group inspire , said : ‘ by allowing gender segregation , @entity18 are complicit in the gender inequality being perpetuated by @entity10 societies			1
‘ @entity18 delves into trying to tell us what constitutes @entity34 religious belief implying that those opposed to segregation must be people from outside of the @entity10 faith , not recognising that often it is @entity34 themselves who oppose gender segregation			1
’ the explosive report showing segregation at lectures across the country comes after a row in march over ‘ forced segregation ’ for an event at @entity101 , @entity172			2
an investigation was launched after students complained single women were made to sit at the back of the room for the debate – about @entity100 and atheism			2
the organisers claimed to have provided a mixed seating area for those objecting to segregation but students who were there said this did not happen			0
@entity187 , who attended the event , said : ‘ after having been told the event would not be gender segregated , we arrived and were told that women were to sit in the back of the auditorium , while men and couples could file into the front			0
’ she said three people were thrown out for refusing to abide by the rules			0
secretary of state for education @entity3 said it was ' a disgrace ' for @entity18 to support the policy of separating men from women at lectures and debates a month later the @entity112 also held an investigation , after a photograph emerged showing separate entrances to a lecture for men and women			1
yesterday , @entity18 wrote to the @entity213 for a definitive legal view			0
critics said @entity18 was turning a blind eye to segregation to protect donations from @entity220 countries and to attract high fee - paying foreign students from the @entity222			1
@entity223 of pressure group the @entity225 said : ‘ the idea of being forced to sit with people of the opposite sex might well lead many to avoid choosing this country to further their education			0
’ a government spokesman said : ‘ we see no valid reason why men and women should be segregated simply to listen to a guest speaker			1

education secretary : it is ‘ a disgrace ’ for @entity18 to support policy
