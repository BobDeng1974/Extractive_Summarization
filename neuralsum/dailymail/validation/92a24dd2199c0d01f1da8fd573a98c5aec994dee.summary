the 34 - year - old , who lives with her husband and daughter in @entity14 , @entity15 , recalled one instance where she made a silent presumption about a @entity19 managing editor			1
ms @entity6 presumed that she was ' too much of a mother ' to follow through on a partnership idea - based on the pictures of the editor 's children on her desk			1
she also did n't speak up when another female editor said they should fire a woman who was pregnant			1
working ' late ' became an obsession , she said , in order to show commitment to her job - even though mothers in the office would typically skew their days much earlier			2
ms @entity6 wrote in @entity9 : ' for mothers in the workplace , it ’s death by a thousand cuts – and sometimes it ’s other women holding the knives			1
' soon after giving birth herself , @entity6 said that she believed her career was over and that she could n't imagine going back to the office for ten hours each day			0
soon afterwards she met @entity62 who wanted to start a company that would allow women to work from home in a range of jobs			0
and that @entity19 editor whom she silently wrote off ? ms @entity6 explains that @entity69 , mother - of - three , has now joined the business as executive editor			1
@entity7 allows women to work from anywhere that suits them - from their home office to a coffee shop			2
workers can take on full - time or part - time contracts , but as the company website states : ' we give you a lot of freedom and we expect a lot in return			0
' ms @entity6 said in several interviews this week that all the tools for moms to work remotely are already in place			1
conference calls can be made on @entity92 , presentations shared on @entity93 , team planning completed on @entity94			0
women from 65 countries have joined the site to improve their chance at finding work - and have so far taken home a collective $ 1 million in pay , according to ms @entity6			1
the challenges are many , the co-founder wrote - and sometimes from career - driven , younger women who she described as ' hardliners ' about spending time in the office ' culture '			2
she wrote : ' they do n’t realize how that '' culture '' pushes women out because it ’s too often set up around how men bond			0
' many of these young women are just toeing the company line			0
i do n’t begrudge them			0
i feel sorry for them			0
they ’re hurting their future selves			0
