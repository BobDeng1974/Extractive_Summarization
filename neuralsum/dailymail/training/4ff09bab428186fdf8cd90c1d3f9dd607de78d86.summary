rail passengers told last night how they feared a @entity2 - style disaster when thousands were trapped inside a station as travel chaos hit @entity6 – and the severe weather added to the @entity9 misery for millions			1
the mayhem across the rail network was caused by overrunning engineering works at some of the country 's busiest stations – to the fury of transport secretary @entity17 who last night read the riot act to @entity20 's chief executive			1
the most chaotic scenes were at the @entity23 station in @entity24 yesterday , which had to be closed by police for two hours from 11am because so many travellers had been diverted there from the much larger @entity27			1
@entity46 , 67 , who was caught up in the crush as she tried to travel home to @entity49 , told @entity50 : ' the platform was jammed with people trying to get off the train			1
it was a @entity2 situation			1
' @entity55 , 57 , from @entity24 , who abandoned plans to visit friends in @entity58 , said : ' it was really unpleasant and jam - packed – some platforms were completely full of people right to the edge			1
i called the police at 10am but it took them so long to take any action			2
' @entity23 is a small station on a suburban line			1
sending everyone there from @entity27 – a major transport hub – was absolutely ludicrous and quite dangerous			1
' train passengers are braced for a second day of travel misery as it is announced workers at @entity27 will toil through the night in an attempt to open the station tomorrow @entity27 was closed due to the overrunning works , with thousands of commuters directed to @entity23 station instead hundreds of travellers reported being left outside the station for up to 90 minutes in freezing wind and rain as a dozen station staff were overwhelmed by the crowds outraged mr @entity17 last night said the situation was ' totally unacceptable ' in a frank phone call to @entity89 , the £ 675,000 - a - year chief executive of @entity20			1
the company receives £ 3.2 billion of taxpayers ' money each year to maintain the tracks			2
mr @entity17 said : ' the situation on the railways this weekend has been totally unacceptable			0
passengers must be able to trust that vital engineering works will be completed on time			1
' an investigation was launched by the rail watchdog , the @entity101 , to establish why the planned maintenance works failed to be completed on time despite thousands of engineers toiling around the clock on @entity9 and @entity43			1
in the worst day of disruption this winter , ice and snow in the north of @entity108 and the @entity109 caused havoc on the roads , left 100,000 homes without power and led to the cancellation of scores of flights			0
however , rail passengers suffered the most with hours of delays			1
speaking to @entity120 , passenger @entity121 , who was travelling from @entity123 , said : ' our train was packed			0
when it arrived there were around a thousand or so people trying to get on it to head north , using the same stairs we were using to get off			0
' everything came to a standstill for 45 minutes before anyone took charge			0
at first they tried to push us to the back of the platform to get people on to the train , then held boarding passengers back and let us go			1
' there were around a dozen @entity145 staff and a dozen police officers there , but they were both asking one another what to do and nobody was taking charge			0
' @entity20 , who are responsible for the engineering works , said labourers will stay on site overnight and hope to have a reduced service running tomorrow no more snow is forecast for @entity6 next week , but there was relief yesterday for thousands of @entity6 skiers who went abroad desperate to find it – the biggest falls of the season so far have transformed barren slopes in the @entity166			1
@entity167 , of chalet company @entity168 in @entity169 in the @entity166 , said : ' @entity9 was tough with the lack of snow but @entity173 guests are going to have a wonderful time			1
' @entity175 , who was trying to travel to @entity176 from @entity24 , said : ' i got off at @entity23 tube station and waited in a queue for half an hour with no information , before one staff member appeared and asked everyone to move back			1
' there was n't much room so that raised a few grumbles but everyone was generally in good spirits , however after an hour stuck in a tunnel and moving just 20ft the police appeared			0
' we were told we had to wait for a platform to be cleared , and had to stand for another 20 minutes in the tunnels			0
' eventually we made it on to the platform and i was very relieved to be back in the fresh air			0
' @entity195 , a semi-retired economics lecturer from @entity196 , was among the crowds waiting to get on a train at @entity23			1
he said : ' any civil engineering contractor would have realised probably weeks ago that they were going to overrun and they must have realised they would be fined			0
' they could have solved that by putting on more resources , more people , more machines - but if the cost of that is more than the fine then they would choose to pay the fine			2
' the staff are telling people the problem , but not the extent of it			2
people are still arriving and waiting in the cold			0
' there are a lot of vulnerable people here			0
my mother - in - law is 94 , we managed to get her into a taxi some time ago			1
but the train companies ought to be arranging coaches , not taxis			0
' sources said that the station would effectively be closed due to delays to works north of the station @entity233 , 45 , a journalist , said he was stuck on a ' dangerously overcrowded ' train after two train - loads of people , one from @entity237 and one from @entity239 , were merged into one			1
mr @entity233 , who was travelling to @entity240 after spending @entity9 with family in @entity237 , said : ' they have decided to run two trains worth of people on one train			0
' in health and safety terms this must be well against the law			0
there is not an inch of room			0
at the last station people tried to get on but could n't			2
one person has been taken ill on the train			0
' there is no room , no information and no apology			0
the engineering works have over-run from @entity9 but they have had plenty of time to prepare			2
' my @entity9 in @entity237 was close to perfect			0
and now thanks to @entity267 i 've been left very angry at the end of my @entity9 break			0
' fellow passenger @entity270 , 62 , said : ' it is packed			0
you have got to fight your way through to the bathroom			0
it is so crowded you can barely move			0
why have they not laid coaches on ? ' the overcrowding is horrendous			0
there is no way of getting any food or water			0
' passengers with large suitcases at @entity23 station this morning , where trains were moved to different platforms at short notice customers will need to start or finish their journey at @entity23 in north @entity24 , with at least one change of train , according to @entity145 transport secretary @entity17 says he will be asking @entity20 what went wrong and what lessons can be learnt @entity20 apologised for the chaos and pledged to fix the problem by tomorrow when millions of commuters return to work			1
the mayhem – which affected trains to and from @entity303 , the north of @entity108 , the @entity109 and the @entity305 – started after engineers failed to lay new tracks on time at @entity27			1
meanwhile , overrunning works west of @entity310 and a signalling fault at @entity240 meant there was a ' very limited ' service there – forcing thousands to head to @entity24 's waterloo station to catch trains to the @entity305			2
@entity317 , managing director of network operations at @entity20 , said last night : ' i 'm deeply sorry for the upheaval caused today			1
we 've had an army of 11,000 engineers out over @entity9 and @entity43 at 2,000 locations nationwide			1
more than 90 per cent have been completed and handed back in time			2
' extra resources have been brought in to ensure the work is completed for the morning and we will then spend some time to better understand what went wrong			2
' bad timing : @entity329 ( pictured ) claimed there was light at the end of the tunnel for passengers outspoken rail minister @entity329 had egg on her face after boasting about rail repairs in her @entity9 message			1
at last there was light at the end of the tunnel for passengers , said ms @entity329 in a message to her constituents in @entity345			2
two days later the railways were plunged into chaos			2
ms @entity329 's message said : ' 10,000 @entity20 employees will be working over the holiday period on thousands of projects , carrying the biggest upgrade of the network since @entity353			1
' someone said politicians are people who , when they see the light at the end of the tunnel , order more tunnel			0
well not any more as big rail projects come to fruition			2

rail passengers said how they feared @entity2 - style disaster
travel chaos hit @entity6 with busy crowds at @entity23 station
travellers had been diverted there from much larger @entity27
news on @entity27 services being affected came late on @entity43
gave furious passengers little time to change their travel plans
investigation launched by rail watchdog , the @entity101
@entity20 apologised and pledged to fix the problem by tomorrow
