when @entity1 became the first daughter of the @entity3 , she was just a twelve - year - old from @entity4 with a full head of voluminous frizzy curls			1
but over the years , as @entity8 has grown up into an intelligent and elegant woman , her curls quickly began to fade , appearing more and more controlled as the years wore on , before eventually vanishing completely			1
now , in a candid interview with @entity11 , @entity8 has finally revealed just what happened to her much - loved ringlets – insisting that , far from being an intentional style change , her once - unruly mane simply straightened itself out over time			1
' ' my curls , in my early twenties , just fell into waves			2
i do n't know if they got tired of me , but the curls slowly subsided , and so now it 's naturally a little bit wavy but ... i miss my curls			2
the 35 - year - old daughter of @entity41 , the 42nd @entity42 , also talked about her marriage to investment banker @entity44 in the new interview , as well as her role as a mother to her baby daughter @entity49			1
quite a change : @entity8 , pictured here at age 11 just a few months before her father @entity52 was elected president , was often the victim of bullying remarks over her unruly hair @entity59 's girl : @entity11 editor - in - chief @entity60 describes @entity8 as being ' innately regal ' with ' a kind of grace that does n't seem practiced ' visit site we 've watched her grow up in the @entity67 to become a woman who commands much commending through her fiercely intelligent and graceful character			1
@entity1 may be the first daughter again and she shows off her sleek grown up look on the cover of @entity11 in a @entity74 dress from the spring 2015 collection			2
she 's now a mother herself and dresses appropriately for her age in a chic little black dress			0
the carefully placed cut out and luxurious fabric show off her enviable figure			0
the simple slim line belt really highlights that and we love the minimalist styling			0
this makes us focus on the woman in front of us			0
we could see this dress being not only a workhorse item in your wardrobe that carries you from the boardroom to the bar for happy hour but a perfect date night outfit if you added a few sparkling baubles here and there			0

' i should apologize to her now , ' she added			0
@entity8 noted that seven - month - old @entity123 , who was born on september 26 , has now become the center of her and her husband 's life ' in the most blessed sense '			1
she said : ' i now understand - this is something else that @entity44 and i talk about all the time - all of the enthusiastic , bombastically spectacular , wonderful things people say about their children , because we also feel and think all those things about @entity49 - that she is just the most remarkable little bubbly , perfect , chunky monkey creature ever			1
' what a difference a decade makes : @entity8 in 2004 ( @entity137 ) and 2014 ( r ) showing off the naturally changing state of her locks still springy : at only 13 - years - old @entity8 had already tamed most of her frizz , but rocked a tightly curled look for most of the years of her father 's presidency despite her glamorous look in this month 's @entity11 fashion spread , @entity8 confessed that fashion is not her forte			1
the former @entity67 resident spoke of her family 's relationship with designer @entity155 , who passed away in october , saying he ' was always giving me fashion advice - often in the form of just telling me what to wear , because i do n't have a fashion brain '			2
although shying away from making a direct comment on her mother 's run for president and her own potential return to the role of first daughter , @entity8 did comment at length on the need for women in politics and gender equality in the workplace			1
' we 've made real progress on legal protections for women , but in no way are women at parity to men in our country in the workplace , ' she explained			0
' and if we look in the political sphere , it is challenging to me that women comprising 20 percent of @entity187 is treated as a real success			0
since when did 20 percent become the definition of equality ? ' and so when you ask about the importance of having a woman president , absolutely it 's important , for , yes , symbolic reasons — symbols are important ; it is important who and what we choose to elevate , and to celebrate			0
