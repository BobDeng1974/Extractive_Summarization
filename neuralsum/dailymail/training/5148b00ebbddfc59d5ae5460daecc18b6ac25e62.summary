but this unflappable newsreader managed to remain unfazed even when her daughter popped up behind her as she delivered a live television report			0
@entity9 's curly - haired daughter walked into the shot and tapped her mother on the shoulder as she read the news on @entity16 's @entity15 television channel			1
but if her daughter 's surprise cameo on the news distracted ms @entity9 from the job at hand , she was n't about to let it show			2

professional : @entity9 reads the news on @entity16 's @entity15 television channel unaware : as she delivers her report , the figure of her daughter can be seen walking into shot behind her here you go mummy : the broadcaster 's daughter blithely walks over and tries to hand her mother a phone oops ! the expression on the little girl 's face is a picture as she tries to hand her mother a smartphone - then realises she is on the air silent admonition : ms @entity9 retained her composure throughout despite the surprise interruption back to business : the broadcaster returns to face the screen after her daughter sheepishly retreats from view			1

@entity9 remained unfazed despite surprise appearance of daughter
