in the village of @entity6 , in northern @entity4 , close to the @entity3 border , the @entity1 family will this morning be crowding into the family farmhouse			1
parents , aunts , uncles , cousins , brothers and sisters , nieces and nephews and grandparents will all be there and all eyes will be fixed on the @entity19 in east @entity20			1
' there 's loads of them , ' says @entity24 , now of @entity25 but once of that parish			1
' loads ! they all gather there to watch my games and they always call me afterwards			2
i think they transmit all their happiness to me			2
' the man dubbed @entity36 in his home country is not the first @entity4 to succeed in the @entity38 — indeed , he could be facing his compatriot and namesake @entity41 in @entity25 's meeting with @entity43			1
@entity24 arrived at the same time as @entity45 's @entity44 and he follows in the footsteps of @entity47 and @entity48			1
@entity25 striker @entity24 opens up about his family , hometown , the @entity51 and life in @entity20 @entity1 joined @entity25 last summer from @entity54 side @entity53 for a reported £ 12 million fee but he is the most celebrated			1
his rapid rise to global prominence has been extraordinary			2
little more than a year ago he was still playing with @entity58 in @entity4 before earning a move to @entity53 in @entity54 in december 2013			1
he scored against @entity60 in an excellent display in a @entity63 friendly and added three more in the @entity51 finals as @entity4 were narrowly eliminated in the first round			1
the 25 - year - old moved to @entity25 in the summer and last week was linked with a £ 15million move to @entity68			1
nowhere has this ascent been more positively received than in @entity6 , though it was not always that way			0
he was the archetypal boy , chastised by his parents for the frequent occasions on which he would skip school to play football			2
' i was always with a ball , or with a bottle , or with whatever we came across , always trying to get a game going , ' he says			0
' loads of times i bunked off school to play			0
i told my parents i was going to school but i never got there			0
i went to play football			2
i 've always been passionate about this game			0
my mum and dad were always telling me off about this			0
but my love for the game was stronger than that ! ' in other tasks , though , he was basically obedient			0
coming from a rural family , he had farm chores to do , including milking the cows , and his father , @entity100 , remembers he did his jobs dutifully			2
@entity24 poses with his large family in their home province of @entity105 the @entity1 family had a special tv feed to watch their golden boy score at the @entity110 in @entity111 football hotbeds do not come much hotter than @entity24 's home province of @entity105			1
@entity105 is on the @entity3 border which accounts for around three per cent of @entity4 's 15.2million population — yet this sweltering , poverty - stricken place boasted 10 members of the country 's 23 - man squad at last summer 's @entity51			1
and that does not include team captain , @entity43 's @entity1 , who was born in the @entity122 but whose parents are from @entity105			1
it is a remarkable production line which sees @entity105 stand apart			1
in a country where seven per cent of the population is of @entity129 descent , @entity4 's football team is almost 80 per cent black and @entity105 is the biggest @entity131 province			1
and until 2014 his had been a gentle rise			0
he left home to join @entity58 , a team in the south of the country , at the age of 18 and rose through the ranks , winning the title in 2013 and being the top scorer in the @entity141 , the equivalent of the @entity143 , a feat for which he earned his @entity36 sobriquet			1
@entity1 was also the @entity54 league 's top scorer in his six months there			1
suddenly he became the focus of a nation			0
during the @entity51 , @entity4 tv was running live feeds from his family home to relay the atmosphere to the nation			1
his arrival at @entity25 , along with @entity157 , has propelled @entity159 's team up the table , injecting frightening pace of which @entity43 will be wary this afternoon			1
it has also brought him to the attention of @entity143 clubs			0
he almost missed his chance of the move to @entity60 after the @entity51 , though			1
@entity25 had contacted @entity167 in @entity54 and fees were being agreed			1
the trouble was no one could track down @entity1 , who was back in @entity6			1
' i was with my family			2
i 'd switched off the phone and was n't taking any calls , ' he says			0
' in the end @entity25 sent someone over because they had been calling over to @entity54 to tell me to come and play in @entity60			1
' @entity20 seems to suit him			1
he lives in @entity179 , in the same apartment block as goalkeeper @entity181			0
' he has helped me a lot with the language , helped me at the club , helped me with getting used to being in @entity60			0
he 's always there to help with whatever i need			2
' however , @entity1 is a keen learner			1
unlike many foreign footballers new to @entity60 , he attends @entity191 classes every day			0
and what he likes most about @entity20 is the chance it gives him to assimilate			2
he can use the @entity196 or go out for a meal with his @entity4 wife , @entity198 , without it being a major event			2
@entity1 tussles with @entity201 midfielder @entity200 in the @entity38 game at @entity203 on january 31 ' it 's a lot easier over here compared to @entity54			1
if you go out in @entity20 , people know you and ask for a picture , but always politely			2
but in @entity208 , in @entity54 — no ! they all crowd round and it 's photo after photo			2
the culture is completely different			0
' not that there is much time for socialising at present			0
@entity198 gave birth to their daughter , @entity216 , on christmas day , so nights are disrupted at present			0
he has a second daughter , @entity220 , who is three and lives in @entity4			2
but fan culture is somewhat removed from his experiences in @entity223			0
he was well aware of the passionate reputation of @entity25 fans — embarrassingly for the club he had seen the film @entity228 , a fictionalised account of @entity25 's hooligans			1
in real life the fans are somewhat more civil than their @entity223 counterparts			0
' it 's completely different in @entity4 and @entity54			1
a lot tougher ! you lose a game and you 've got to be careful when you 're leaving the stadium in case some nutter jumps out at you			0
here , on the other hand , if you lose a game , the fans are still there asking if you 'll sign a programme and that 's something really nice about @entity191 football			1
they 're a lot more friendly			0
the culture is completely different here			0
' @entity1 scored three goals at the @entity51 last year - two against @entity249 and one against @entity250 having just settled into @entity25 , he does not especially want to engage with the talk of @entity68 's interest			1
' i found out about it from the social networks and from what my team - mates were saying , ' he says			0
' nobody said anything definite to me			0
but if a team like @entity68 is interested in me , it 's a big compliment			2
it makes me want to keep on getting better			0
' for now , though , there are more immediate challenges , such as the visit of @entity43			0
his immersion into @entity191 culture has continued apace in recent days			0
' i 'm learning about the rivalries we 've got here in @entity25 , ' he says			2
' some say the derby is against @entity277 , others say the matches against @entity43 are another kind of derby			0
so we 've got to win it			0
' if they do , you can expect the celebrations at @entity19 to matched by the fiesta in @entity6			0
@entity1 is ready and raring to go for @entity25 ahead of the game with @entity43 on sunday since his move to @entity19 , @entity1 has managed four goals in 24 appearances in all competitions @entity293 's @entity292 challenges @entity1 for the ball during the @entity38 match in september @entity296 now to join the @entity297 at the @entity19 , 2015 - 2016			1
