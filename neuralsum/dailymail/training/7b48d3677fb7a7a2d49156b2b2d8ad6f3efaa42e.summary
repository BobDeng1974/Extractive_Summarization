by @entity0 published : 17:07 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 14:28 est , 13 january 2014 strong storms have been wreaking havoc as they barreled across @entity4 this weekend – and one scared witness caught some of the mayhem on camera			1
@entity9 , of @entity10 , took video of an entire section of a condominium complex collapsing during the violent storm			2
he was talking about how scary the storm was while taking the video in the town near @entity18 when the building came down into his back yard			2
a man and a woman , were killed saturday in separate car accidents , and a handful of others were injured as winds gusted up to 86 miles per hour , according to both @entity31 and @entity38			1
those gusts topped wind speeds during two recent hurricanes , @entity38 noted			0
the male , 33 , ran off the road in a torrential downpour			0
the woman , 50 , died from injuries sustained when she was hit by a falling tree limb			0
timber ! : a loud roar came from outside and the building started blowing over both buildings : once the building at center went down , it also took out the building on the screen 's far right no injuries : thankfully no one was inside the collapsing buildings , and no one outside them was injured demolished : the buildings were reduced to a pile of splinters in less than a minute the most dramatic scene came courtesy of mr @entity9			2
he sounded nervous while taking the video and talked about the dangerous storm			0
then , as if on cue , a deafening sound came from in front of him and a whole section of the condo was literally blown down			0
it was still under construction , and no injuries resulted from the collapse , but the building was left in a giant heap in mr @entity82 ’s backyard			1
the collapse took out four units , according to @entity31			1
winds then howled through the opening left by the collapsed building and brought an eerie fog and mist into mr @entity9 's backyard that cut visibility down to almost zero			1
the powerful storm roared through the area on the back of a cold front that is bringing round two of the @entity97 to the northern half of the @entity99 .			0

a total of four condominium units were taken out in the collapse
the building was under construction when it was blown over by winds as high as 86 miles per hour
@entity4 was *battered* by storms both saturday and *sunday*
