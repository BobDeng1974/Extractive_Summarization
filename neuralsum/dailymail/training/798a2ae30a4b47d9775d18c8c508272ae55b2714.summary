by @entity0 published : 13:51 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 06:35 est , 3 march 2014 decision : a @entity4 ruling will decide if rap lyrics were admissible in an attempted murder trial a @entity8 man whose rap lyrics boasted he would ' blow your face off and leave your brain caved in the street ' will have his attempted murder case considered by the state 's @entity4 , which will decide whether the words he penned should have been admitted at trial			1
@entity20 's case is being watched closely by civil liberties advocates who contend the lyrics should be considered protected free speech under the @entity24			1
in an amicus brief in support of @entity20 , the @entity25 @entity8 contends that rap lyrics , because of their violent imagery , are treated differently than other written works			1
' that a rap artist wrote lyrics seemingly embracing the world of violence is no more reason to ascribe to him a motive and intent to commit violent acts than to ... indict @entity40 for having " shot a man in @entity42 just to watch him die , " ' according to the brief			1
after an initial trial ended without a verdict , @entity20 was convicted at a second trial of shooting @entity47 multiple times at close range in 2005 , leaving @entity47 paralyzed from the waist down			2
@entity47 was reluctant initially to identify @entity20 as the shooter , but eventually testified at the trial that @entity20 was the assailant			2
@entity47 testified the two men sold drugs as part of a three - man ' team ' and developed a dispute when @entity47 began skimming some of the profits for himself			0
during the trial , state prosecutors read 13 pages of rap lyrics that were found in the back seat of the car @entity20 was driving when arrested			1
the writings , some penned three or four years before the @entity47 shooting , include a reference to ' four slugs drillin ' your cheek to blow your face off and leave your brain caved in the street			2
' aspiring rapper : the case will set a precedent for using rap lyrics and other forms of expression as evidence another passage describes a mother in a mortuary , taking clothes ' red soaked ravaged with holes ' and ' wonderin ' if you died in pain			1
was it instant or did you feel the slugs fryin ' your veins			0
' in a 2 - 1 ruling that overturned the verdict , an appellate court noted that , similar to admitting evidence of prior crimes , caution must be exercised when allowing prior writings as evidence in a trial			0
the judges also wrote that the lyrics were n't necessary to buttress the state 's case			0
' this was not a case in which circumstantial evidence of defendant 's writings were critical to show his motive , ' the majority wrote			0
' nor was such evidence important to show that defendant had the intent to kill @entity47 , which the state was required to establish to prove attempted murder			1
this brutal shooting bespoke intent to kill			0
' judge @entity120 wrote in a dissenting opinion that the lyrics ' relevance in showing motive and intent outweighed their prejudicial effect on the jury , and that ' defendant 's songs narrated events similar to the conduct which resulted in the charged offenses			0
' in its brief , the @entity25 said that an analysis of similar cases in other states found that in 14 of 18 instances , judges allowed rap lyrics to be admitted as evidence			1
the brief urges the @entity4 to toughen the standards for admitting lyrics as evidence in a trial			2
' we 're not saying song lyrics can never be evidence , but that there needs to be a direct connection to the crimes , ' said @entity152 , deputy legal director of the @entity25 @entity8			0
the @entity154 prosecutor 's office , which is to argue the case before the @entity4 , declined to comment on the case .			0

@entity158 is deciding whether a 2012 trial attempted murder trial should have allowed rap lyrics as evidence
@entity20 was sentenced to *30* years prison for attempted murder in the case
the prosecution used as evidence violent rap lyrics he *'d* penned
civil liberties advocates say the lyrics should have been protected as free speech
