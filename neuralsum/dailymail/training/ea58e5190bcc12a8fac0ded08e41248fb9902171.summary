by @entity1 reporter they say who you are is written all over your face - except , perhaps , when it comes to your sexuality			2
a new study reveals most people ca n't tell if a man is gay just by looking at his dial because homosexuals tend to have more ' masculine ' features than straights			1
debunking the myth that all gays are effeminate , the research found homosexuals tend to have ' wider and shorter faces , smaller and shorter noses , and rather massive and more rounded jaws ' compared with straight guys			1
under the gaydar : a new study shows the faces of gay men may be deemed more masculine than straight men as they generally have wider jaws , shorter noses and shorter faces interesting : the study found it was hard for people to determine a man 's sexuality by looking at his face @entity36 reported researchers from the @entity38 at @entity39 , @entity40 , and @entity41 examined the faces of gays and straights in two studies			1
the first analyzed whether gay men have noticeably different facial features than straight men			1
after reviewing the portraits of 80 men - 40 gay and 40 straight white , @entity50 men - and comparing more than 11,000 coordinates , researchers found gay men have distinct ' morphological features ' which are generally more masculine			2
the second study examined whether sexual orientation could be determined based solely on these features			0
openly gay : actor @entity60 ( left ) came out after he met his partner and singer @entity61 ( right ) revealed he used to make fun of gay people before he publicly outed himself forty female and 40 male students were asked to rate the sexual orientation of the 66 participants - 33 gay , 33 straight - on a scale of one to seven , with one indicating a very straight look and seven indicating a very gay look			0
raters were also asked to rank masculinity and femininity from one to seven , with one indicting very masculine and seven indicating very feminine			0
the face shapes of gay men were rated as more masculine than those of straight men			1
the respondents also could n't correctly determine sexual orientation from the pictures			0
confident : @entity83 's @entity82 ( left ) is one of @entity85 's youngest openly gay actors and while former ' @entity87 heartthrob @entity86 ( right ) came out in 2006 ' this shows that sexual orientation judgment based on stereotyped gender specific traits leads to frequent misjudgment , ' the authors wrote			0
' it 's necessary to point out to possible misunderstandings of our results			0
' the fact that we have found some significant morphological differences between homosexual and heterosexual men does not mean that any of the groups is easily recognizable on the street ( and our study 2 actually shows that it 's not that easy to guess anyone 's sexual orientation without knowing it ) , or that anything like that should be done ( like pointing on people with our illustrations and guessing who is who )			2

new study shows faces of gay men are *perceived* as more ' masculine ' than those of straight men
*concludes* gay men have wider and shorter faces , smaller and shorter noses and *bigger* jaws
@entity40 's @entity38 also found people ca n't determine a man 's sexuality by his face
