@entity0 is the 111th best golfer in the world			1
you can grin your way through life as the 111th best golfer in the world			1
judging by some of the stuff said and written about @entity0 in the build - up to his 20th masters , it will be an achievement if he makes the cut			1
very respected names have close to begged him not to compete			2
@entity0 does n’t see it like that at all			1
he ’s in it to win it			2
and it ’s in those little moments that the old @entity0 — some would argue the real @entity0 — breaks cover again			1
@entity0 was all smiles as he played a practice around ahead of his 20th appearance at the masters the former best player in the world arrives at @entity31 ranked a lowly 111th in the game @entity0 name appears on the @entity28 ' tournament winner 's board four times ; 1997 , 2001 , 2002 and 2005 it was all smiles and wise - cracks as @entity0 sat before the assembled press on tuesday			1
questions that would once have been greeted with terse disregard were warmly expanded upon			2
memory lane was tripped down , the elder statesman played			2
he even referred to some of the correspondents in the room as his friends			2
and then he was asked where a win this week , from one ranking place lower than @entity52 of @entity53 , at a point in his career when it was wondered whether he would be seen on the golf course as a competing professional again , would rank in his career achievements			2
and up leapt old @entity0			1
he did n’t answer this one with a short , evocative speech or a ready quip			2
he shut it down , old school			2
one sentence , no messing , no prospect of elaboration			2
@entity0 has insisted that he would not enter a tournament unless he thought he had a chance of winning it the 39 - year - old looks towards the ground after hitting a shot during practice on monday @entity0 smiles as he talks with his traditional practice partner @entity74 ( left ) at @entity31 ‘ it would be my 15th major , ’ said @entity0			1
the temperature in the room dropped by several degrees			2
the questioner , gamely , tried again with a slight rephrase			2
‘ long way to go before that , ’ @entity0 replied			1
‘ lot of work to do			2
and , of course , that is exactly what it would be			2
just his 15th major , if it signalled a true return to form			1
and on to the next one			2
@entity96 4 @entity95 was in ninth grade — 14 years old — when @entity0 won his last major in 2008			1
but if he could win a fifth masters he would be back in the game			1
and no more mr @entity100 , one feels			2
from 111th in the world , @entity0 has time to take the scenic route in conversation			1
back to where he was , back to contending , he would be all business again			2
not entirely like before , of course , because he could never go back to before — but not many of the guys who are genuinely fancied to be wearing the green jacket on sunday night practised as @entity0 did , with partner and kids in tow			1
@entity0 gets a hug from his children , @entity114 and @entity115 , who will carry his bag for the par three tournament @entity120 ' girlfriend @entity119 leads the pair around the course to watch their father practice ski champion @entity123 has a chat with tournament favourite @entity126 during practice as @entity0 putted , @entity119 , a world champion skier , clutched @entity114 and @entity115 and chatted to a passing @entity126			1
@entity126 , whose easy manner and charisma require no effort , is not here to smell the azaleas			0
he is the world ’s best golfer , on the brink of a third consecutive major in what would be a personal @entity140 — only the sixth in the world to do it			1
he has a lot at stake			0
@entity0 is on bonus time			1
in january , he shot an 82 , 11 - over - par , at the @entity146 , his worst round in close to 13 years			1
a week later , he walked off at @entity148 after 11 holes citing back problems			0
his partner that day , @entity151 , thought it was more out of embarrassment			0
‘ he was n’t doing anything good , ’ he said			0
@entity0 then took an indefinite break from golf , with claims he had the chipping yips			1
on monday he admitted being stuck between two release patterns , which amounts to the same thing			0
when he spoke of his journey to this point of return , it was clear he regards it as the second — maybe third , considering the events of 2009 — phase of his career			0
@entity0 shot the worst round of his professional career , an 82 at the @entity146 @entity0 speaks to the world 's media after withdrawing from the first round of the @entity176 the 14 major winner stands at the tee as the @entity31 course is mowed ahead of this year 's tournament ‘ people would never understand how much work i put in to come back and do this again , ’ he said			1
‘ i worked my ass off , that ’s the easiest way to describe it			0
@entity185 up to sun down			0
when the kids were in school , i ’d be doing it			0
when they went to sleep , still doing it			0
‘ the way i saw it , if i started when the sun came up i ’d be a better player when it set			0
it would come in flashes			0
it would come for 10 minutes and then i ’d lose it for an hour			0
then i ’d get it back			0
i ’d have it for an hour , lose it for 10 minutes			0
and then it was just there			0
there were some frustrating moments , but i had to stick with it			0
there were times when clubs flew , when a few suddenly slipped out of my hand — and travelled some good distances			0
‘ but we kept working , shot by shot , hour by hour			0
it was slow and steady , just taking little bits of progression			0
i had to hammer it out , make sure it was engrained			0
i just had to get through it			0
’ @entity0 smiles after winning his last major in a play - off with @entity213 at the @entity214 the all conquering @entity215 celebrates winning the masters after sinking a play - off putt in 2005 @entity218 slips the green jacket on @entity0 after he won his first major at the @entity28 and now he ’s through it			1
for while nobody expects the player one better than @entity225 of @entity226 to beat among the most competitive masters fields in the modern era , that does n’t mean there is not a desperate yearning for the impossible to happen			1
it does n’t help that the man in @entity0 ’s place is not @entity235 , or @entity236 , or any of the other star spangled pretenders , but a 25 - year - old from @entity239 who plays for the wrong team when the @entity242 is on			1
@entity215 likes @entity126 , but it loves @entity0			1
his victories once caused a spike in @entity246 ’s monday morning figures , and golf ’s television numbers have not recovered from his spell in recovery			0
so the positive lines in @entity0 ’s masters preparation are lapped up and thrown out as a potential feelgood hit of the summer			1
that ’s why @entity0 is still , against all logic , asked about winning here			1
why he plays the game , and talks about winning right back at them			0
‘ i prepare to win and expect to go and do that , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve come close in the last 10 years			0
half of the tournaments since 2005 i had a chance on the back nine			0
i just did n’t get it done			0
for whatever reason , i did n’t seize the opportunity			0
’ the former champion has spoken of practicing his game from dawn until dusk to hone his swing woods latest comeback has sparked a tidal wave of interest from @entity215 supporters and beyond the room seemed pleased with the answer			1
woods was asked what , at 39 , remained his greatest motivation			1
‘ winning , ’ deadpanned old @entity0 , suddenly solemn			1
‘ i like it , ’ he said , before disappearing through a side door			0
@entity0 is the 111th best golfer in the world and entirely at ease with that			1

@entity0 begins his 20th masters ranked a lowly 111th in the world
former world no 1 turned on the charm ahead of @entity294 at @entity31
@entity215 was *joined* by girlfriend @entity119 and his children
a fifth green jacket would take the 39 - year - old 's major haul to 15
