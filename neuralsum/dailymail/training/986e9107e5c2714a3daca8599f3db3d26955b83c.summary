by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 got off the mark for @entity4 after netting in his first appearance for the club since his move from @entity8			0
the @entity10 striker scored just after the hour in their 1 - 1 friendly draw against third - tier @entity14 side @entity13			1
@entity15 and @entity16 also appeared , and @entity17 started as he continues his recovery from long - term injury , but it was otherwise a very youthful - looking side put out by @entity22 , with many of his stars still on holiday following @entity28 's @entity27 triumph			1
so it is @entity2 who will be the centre of attention for the next couple of weeks as @entity22 and @entity4 prepare for the upcoming season ahead			0
and the forward will be glad he 's off to such a good start , as he looks to replace the recently departed @entity57 , following his free transfer switch from @entity8			0
battle : @entity2 fights for the ball with @entity62 's @entity61 instruction : @entity22 shouting on from the sidelines @entity65 : but in the end he was disappointed the game could only end in a draw video @entity4 training for @entity2			2

@entity2 off the mark for @entity4 in pre-season
@entity10 forward nets in 1 - 1 friendly draw with @entity13
@entity22 's side still *missing* @entity28 stars after @entity27 win
