more than 500 surgeries could close in @entity2 over the next year because so many gps are about to retire , senior doctors warn			1
the @entity4 of @entity3 says that thousands of patients will have to travel to the next town and waiting times at these practices will rise further			1
figures from the college identify 543 practices where more than 90 per cent of the @entity3 are over 60 and likely to retire imminently			1
but there is a severe shortage of younger doctors to replace them as the career becomes unpopular			2
more than 500 surgeries could close in @entity2 over the next year because so many gps are about to retire , senior doctors have warned earlier this week @entity18 promised everyone would be able to see their family doctor seven days a week by 2020 , as long as the @entity22 are still in power			1
but senior gps warned that the plans would not work as there are too few doctors to man surgeries at weekends			1
tomorrow college president dr @entity29 will warn that in future practices will have to ‘ close their doors ’ to patients			0
addressing its annual conference in @entity35 , she is expected to say : ‘ every practice closed is a loss to a local community			0
‘ not only do patients lose out , but it piles more pressure on neighbouring practices , swelling patient lists already bursting at the seams			0
‘ with a growing , ageing population , not to mention a baby boom , we need to increase capacity in general practice , not take it away			0
if this was a business it would be expanding to meet demand – not shutting down services			0
’ figures from the college identify 543 practices where more than 90 per cent of the @entity3 are over 60 and likely to retire imminently ; the problem has been worsened by younger gps quitting to work abroad or re-training in different careers normal retirement age in the @entity62 is 60 but the average for @entity3 is 59 as many leave early due to the demands of the job			1
the problem has been worsened by younger gps quitting to work abroad or re-training in different careers			1
@entity3 say they are not being given enough money by the government to deal with the demands of a rising , ageing population			2
some surgeries are so overwhelmed they have begun striking patients off their lists to ease the pressure			0
last week dr @entity29 admitted waiting times to see a gp were a ‘ national disgrace ’			1
today she will compare gp services to a ‘ dam ’ that protects hospitals from becoming ‘ flooded ’ with patients			0
she will say : ‘ so far much of the damage to the dam wall has been hidden from the public – they see the flooding downstream in accident and emergency departments and in hospital pressures , but they have n’t been aware that @entity3 , nurses and practice teams have been absorbing that pressure by trying to do more and more with less and less			2
‘ but if we let that situation continue we will see whole chunks of the dam fall apart when practices have to shut their doors			0
’ earlier this week @entity101 , of the @entity102 , warned that some surgeries were putting patients at risk due to basic failings			0
he said standards at 2 per cent of practices – equivalent to 160 surgeries nationwide – were ‘ very worrying ’ .			2

at 543 practices 90 per cent of the @entity3 are over 60 and soon to retire
the problem has been worsened by younger gps quitting to work abroad
waiting times to see a gp have been *slammed* as a ' national disgrace '
