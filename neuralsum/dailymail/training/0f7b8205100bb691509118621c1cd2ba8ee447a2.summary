@entity0 have developed a new , wheeled robot that can create enormous drawings in the sand			2
the robot — called the @entity5 — works by dragging a set of pins through the sand , like a rake			1
each pin is individually raisable , allowing the contraption to draw lines of varying thicknesses			0
a ' canvas ' is created by setting down poles , which the robot uses as markers to calculate its position			1
images are designed on an @entity21 or tablet app which can then transmit the data to the machine			1
it then takes around 10 minutes to create the artwork			0
