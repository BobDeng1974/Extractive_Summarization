by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 27 april 2013 updated : 17:08 est , 27 april 2013 how would you go about renovating @entity2 ? @entity3 took on a task of almost that size in 2010 when he bought @entity6 in @entity7 , an @entity8			1
the 700 - year - old tower had been derelict for more than a decade when mr @entity3 , a veteran of many conversions , decided to turn it into a modern home – and bravely entered into battle with a small army of bureaucrats intent on preserving as much of the tower as possible			1
‘ it looked in a sorry state when i first saw it , ’ says the 47 - year - old human resources consultant			2
‘ the roof was leaking and the windows were smashed			1
it had been left to rot , damp and pigeons			2
but i knew it was something special			2
’ high achiever : @entity3 succeeded in the daunting task of restoring the 14th century @entity6 in @entity7 , and is now selling it for £ 1.35million if location is everything , then it will be hard to find a better home in @entity7			1
built as part of the city ’s medieval defences in 1299 , on top of city foundations laid down by the roman emperor @entity37 , the tower sits on the eastern bank of the @entity39 , alongside @entity40 , and commands astonishing views of the river and city , including @entity44 and the ruins of @entity46			1
with more than 2,500 sq ft of living space on three floors , including three bedrooms , three bathrooms and a roof terrace – you even get your own flagpole – @entity6 is now on the market for £ 1.35 million through @entity56 estate agency			1
being a monument may have been its attraction for @entity3 , but it also quickly proved to be its major drawback			2
given its historic and cultural importance , there were as many restrictions on what could be renovated as there were things to repair – and several different agencies to deal with			2
‘ there was @entity71 , @entity72 , planning officers , conservation officers , building regulations , ’ he recalls			2
‘ the red tape was astonishing , but i ’m lucky that negotiating with people is part of my job			0
the important thing is to have a vision , and to work towards that			0
’ medieval style : @entity6 has more than 2,500 ¿ sq ft of living space on three floors , including three bedrooms , three bathrooms and a roof terrace complete renovation : one of the three new bedrooms inside the tower after its time protecting the city from invaders and tax - evaders – a great chain was stretched across the @entity39 from @entity6 to @entity98 on the opposite shore , to keep the enemy out and make sure visitors paid a toll – in 1677 the tower was leased to what would become the @entity104 , and used as a pumping station			1
a donkey used to power the pump , tramping around the circular living room			0
if the animal was sick , prisoners would be drafted in to do the donkey work			0
in 1836 , a dedicated engine house was built , requiring @entity114 @entity113 to sign an @entity115 decommissioning @entity6			1
after that it became the @entity104 ’s headquarters and , to make it worthy of its high - profile visitors , oak panelling , decoratively plastered ceilings and a @entity123 lift were added			0
an expert called in by mr @entity3 to assess the lift found it to be in amazingly good working order – it had been used only twice a month to ferry executives to their meetings in the top - floor boardroom			0
mr @entity3 was obliged to run everything past the various agencies to ensure as sympathetic a renovation as possible			0
everything from wood ( oak for ceiling beams , @entity140 pine for upper floors ) and radiators ( cast iron ) to windows and the colour of lime - washed walls had to be given the green light			1
in @entity7 , there was no shortage of master craftsmen , stonemasons , glaziers and carpenters to help him do the job			1
atmospheric : an 1840 watercolour painting showing @entity6 before the completion of the bridge which saw the top section removed clever use has been made of the building ’s unusual shape			1
@entity164 columns in the high - ceilinged living room support a mezzanine office / bedroom , utilising the dead space above and creating the feeling of a cosy farmhouse below			0
opposite the lift on the ground floor are what appear to be large oak cabinets , actually a modern bathroom worthy of a high - class hotel			0
having defended a city and watered its inhabitants , @entity6 ’s current incarnation as a family home could be considered a form of retirement			1
if so , it ’s certainly a comfortable one			0
the 4ft - thick walls lock in the warmth from underfloor heating and keep the noise out to such an extent that it ’s difficult to believe you ’re in the middle of a city			0
and its security is second to none : in its 700 years it has withstood attack by rebel barons , @entity200 ’s roundheads and the @entity201			0
workmen discovered shrapnel damage from @entity205 bombs while repairing the roof			1
the renovations cost £ 200,000 alone , mr @entity3 says , and took him 12 months – not bad considering the complexity of the project			1
@entity210 of @entity56 says location is as important when it comes to buying a medieval tower as it is with any other home			2
‘ you ’d expect a piece of history like this to stand atop a grassy knoll			0
instead , it ’s in the heart of @entity7 , ’ she says			1
mr @entity3 is selling up because his job means he is spending little time in @entity7 these days , but he takes great pleasure in having brought @entity6 back to life			1
‘ the tower has stood for more than 700 years			2
i feel i ’ve brought it up to standard and there ’s no reason it ca n’t survive for another 700 years			0
it ’s an incredible place and i ’m very proud to have been part of its long and illustrious history			0
