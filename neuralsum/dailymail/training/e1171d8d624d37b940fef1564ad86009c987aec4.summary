have you ever experienced deeply pleasurable tingles that begin in the back of your head and spread down throughout your body and limbs , triggered by certain sounds or physical sensations ? this can be anything from getting a haircut , hearing a paint brush against canvas , to listening to someone whisper			1
if you have , you are experiencing what is being referred to as @entity15 , or @entity16 , dubbed a ' braingasm ' by those who experience it			1
@entity20 film - maker @entity19 is exploring the phenomenon - and the enthusiastic community which has sprung up around it - in a new documentary , @entity16			1
as sweets are unwrapped and paper clips arranged ( common triggers , perhaps ) , voices tell us of what they feel when they hear their ' special sounds ' : ' i feel tingles going off from the top of my head , travelling down my spine. , ' breathes one			1
another adds : ' the brain orgasm ... leaves you surprisingly relaxed and soothed			0
' @entity19 is appealing for more stories to complete her documentary			0
@entity42 , one of the first to write about the @entity15 in @entity43 , says it is sparked off by ' expertise , precision , reassuring speech patterns and gentle sounds			1
' he says : ' i once saw a man talk for 10 minutes about the benefits of purchasing a pack of 10 blank video cassettes , and it left my head gently buzzing in a way that 's hard to describe			1
the more gentle and redundant their explanations are , the more pleasure i get			0
' @entity42 is not alone			0
the recently - discovered phenomenon , like so many others , came to light through the internet and now has its own dedicated fan - base , research page and soon , the first scientific study looking into brain patterns of people experiencing @entity15			1
a @entity70 search for @entity71 turns up thousands of videos			1
most commonly , they are young women , speaking in soft , whispery monotones about nothing in @entity76 most popular , by @entity77 , has so far has had almost 800,000 views			1
the @entity80 page , which has 11,200 members , describes the phenomenon as ' a pleasant , often intense tingling sensation that begins in the head and travels down the body to varying extents			1
' ' it is often accompanied by a euphoric feeling , and can overwhelm the experiencer of a particularly strong @entity15 event			1
some @entity15 experiencers are triggered from an uncontrolled external stimulus ; other experiencers can control an @entity15 event through conscious thought triggers			1
' @entity96 : @entity15 proponent ' @entity97 ' brushes her hair for hours for the listening pleasure of the @entity15 community one particularly interminable one made by ' @entity97 ' begins with a breathy explanation of what the viewer is about to see : @entity97 brushing her hair while it 's wet			1
then , she plans to dry the hair , and then brush her hair while it 's dry - all for your aural pleasure			0
the video goes for more than an hour and has 32,604 views			2
another , made by @entity112 and called @entity113 of you , features a young woman in a maternal / nursemaid role , caressing the camera , speaking softly to it , and assuring it that it 's going to be ok , and dabbing its fevered brow with a washcloth			0
one might expect such videos to be the object of ridicule , but it 's just the opposite - people seem to let down their guard and let a stranger 's soft whispers or the sound of someone brushing their hair comfort them			2
@entity135 commented on @entity113 of you : ' thank you very much for ﻿ making this ; could n't seem to wind down till i found this , and now i 'm all tingly and warm ... time to crawl into bed and finally sleep			0
i 'll definately [ sic ] be poking around on your channel			0
' @entity143 said , ' this is by far my favorite video ! please do another similar because i could probably recite this due to how many ﻿ times i 've watched it haha			2
i love the wet towel and the tucking in			0
it made me feel so cozy : ) thanks a lot @entity151			0
' comfort : @entity153 at @entity112 dabs her camera 's hot forehead with a a damp washcloth in the immensely popular @entity113 of you video the owner of @entity112 channel , who refers to herself as @entity153 in her videos , is a @entity165 @entity15 enthusiast			1
she 's made 211 videos , which include ' saleswoman role play - shoe shopping ' , where she pretends to sell you a pair of shoes , ' relaxing chocolate tasting ' and another where she talks - whispers - the viewer through her grandmother 's jewellery collection			2
it 's hardly edge - of - your - seat stuff			0
but for the @entity15 community , this stuff is like a drug			1
@entity182 wrote : ' i finally know i 'm not the only one with tingly dealing if someone looks at thing or makes noises			0
i had it as a child an nobody understood ... i finally know i 'm not the only ﻿ one			0
' another commenter wrote that 11:40 was his favorite part of the jewellery video - featuring @entity153 scraping her finger over an earring			0
in her videos she refers to herself as @entity153 , but when she spoke to @entity199 , she said her name was @entity201			0
she said some of the subscribers to her videos include soldiers in @entity205 and @entity206			0
' and they share with me how much they struggle with their nightmares that they get , ' she said			0
' and the @entity15 whisper videos , they actually help them fall asleep better , which is amazing because they sometimes say medications do n't work , but these videos work instead			1
' there are also ' unintentional ' @entity15 videos - instructional videos such as someone demonstrating @entity221 bookbinding , making origami or , as many @entity15 experiencers say , the late @entity224 , whose combination of softly spoken words and demonstrating technique seems to push a lot of @entity15 buttons			1
@entity230 : it 's unlikely the maker of this instructional video had any idea it would be a trigger for @entity15 it 's unlikely that @entity71 is a new phenomenon			1
@entity70 , @entity238 and @entity80 have changed the way people communicate and share ideas and information - there 's a forum for everything and our tendency to ' overshare ' online has created diverse interest communities			2
@entity71 is the same - it began in 2009 , a @entity251 group called the @entity252 formed ' in hopes of finding people who experience the same sensation			2
' in 2010 @entity256 started a blog called @entity258 , on which is a timeline of @entity15			2
that same year @entity261 , who founded the site asmr - research.org site , and coined the term @entity71			0
after that point , the timeline becomes crowded with events , media attention and group meetings			0
in september 2012 an @entity15 app was released for @entity271			2
so where to next for the mysterious @entity15 and its devoted community ? well , a @entity276 user and @entity278 undergrad @entity277 announced earlier in the year that he plans to perform brain scans to study it for his thesis			1
@entity277 said he planned to release his preliminary discoveries on @entity15 in the next few months			2
we 're tingling with anticipation .			0
