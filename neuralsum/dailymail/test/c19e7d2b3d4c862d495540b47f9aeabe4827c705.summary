scientists say they have found 50 galaxies that may contain intelligent alien races			1
these galaxies were found to be emitting ‘ unusually high ’ levels of radiation - possibly indicating ‘ the presence of a highly advanced civilisation			1
’ within these galaxies , the researchers said it was possible that an alien race could be harnessing the power of the stars - emitting huge amounts of noticeable heat in the process			1
@entity18 scientists have found evidence that we may not be alone			1
they found 50 galaxies emitting unusually high levels of radiation			1
this could be because aliens are harnessing the power of stars			1
however , further research is needed to confirm that is the case			1
shown is @entity29 , one promising galaxy candidate the study was led by dr @entity32 from the @entity33 and @entity34 at @entity35 in @entity18			2
the @entity36 from @entity37 ( @entity38 ) , published in the @entity39 , details how the team thought they might see the infrared signature of a race far more advanced than ours			0
a proposed method for harnessing the power of an entire star is known as a @entity48 sphere			1
first proposed by theoretical physicist @entity48 in 1960 , this would be a swarm of satellites that surrounds a star			0
they could be an enclosed shell , or spacecraft spread out to gather its energy - known as a @entity48 swarm			0
if such structures do exist , they would emit huge amounts of noticeable infrared radiation back on @entity61			0
but as of yet , such a structure has not been detected			0
source : all about @entity65 magazine ‘ the idea behind our research is that , if an entire galaxy had been colonised by an advanced spacefaring civilisation , the energy produced by that civilisation 's technologies would be detectable in mid-infrared wavelengths , ’ said dr @entity32			2
the energy used by such a race to be noticeable would have to be huge - likely harnessing the power of a galaxy ’s stars			1
but dr @entity32 said that ‘ fundamental thermodynamics tells us that this energy must be radiated away as heat in the mid-infrared wavelengths ’			0
this would make them noticeable to @entity90 's @entity89 telescope , used in the study			0
the researchers picked out 100,000 galaxies of interest , and found that 50 of them were emitting ‘ unusually high levels of mid-infrared radiation			1
’ ‘ our follow - up studies of those galaxies may reveal if the origin of their radiation results from natural astronomical processes , or if it could indicate the presence of a highly advanced civilization , ’ said dr @entity32			2
a proposed method for harnessing the power of an entire star is known as a @entity48 sphere ( artist 's impression shown )			1
first proposed by theoretical physicist @entity48 in 1960 , this would be a swarm of satellites that surrounds a star to gather its energy the findings were made using @entity90 ’s orbiting @entity89 ( @entity89 ) telescope ( artist 's illustration shown )			0
this telescope is perfect for detecting mid-infrared radiation that an advanced alien race might be emitting however , talking to @entity122 , dr @entity32 noted that the findings were not a sure - fire sign of alien life			2
the observations could simply be due to natural phenomena , such as dust and star formation			0
he said , including the 50 galaxies , none of the 100,000 were found ‘ with more than 85 per cent of their light being used by alien industry			1
’ however , it ’s possible that some galaxies do harbour advanced alien life - but they are emitting less energy than we can currently detect			2
‘ the harder we look and the longer we work , the better our detection limit will be , and the less energy a galaxy - spanning civilization would need to use for us to discover it , ’ he added			0
another possibility , of course , is that such civilisations simply do n’t exist			0
but dr @entity32 and his colleagues will be hoping that is not the case - and they are continuing to study galaxies for signs that we are not alone			2
the @entity36 from @entity37 ( @entity38 ) , published in the @entity39 , details how the team thought they might see the infrared signature of a race far more advanced than ours			0
none have been confirmed yet - but the signs so far could be considered promising			0

@entity18 scientists find evidence that we might not be alone
they found 50 galaxies emitting unusually high levels of radiation
this could be because aliens are harnessing the power of entire stars
however , further research is needed to confirm that is the case
