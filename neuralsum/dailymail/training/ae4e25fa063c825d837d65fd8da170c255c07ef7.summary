@entity0 might have @entity1 and @entity2 its historic @entity3			0
but the coolest cold spot this week — making front - page news and dominating the chat on snowy websites and glacial blogspots — has been a hitherto unknown resort where i happen to be skiing right now			1
to the ranks of @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and all those other celebrity perches on the world ’s more fashionable mountains can now be added another name : @entity19 in , er , @entity20			1
it has a certain rugged simplicity — the nearest thing to après - ski is a pint in the local village of @entity27 ( and the nearest nightclub is in downtown @entity29 ) — but it is as beautiful as any @entity31			1
peak performance : @entity33 tackles @entity19 , @entity20 - just half an hour 's drive from @entity35 there are no queues for the ski lifts and it ’s all extremely peaceful ; no piped music , shrieking @entity41 or bossy instructors shouting ‘ bend ze knees ’			1
apart from the odd walker there is n’t a soul around			1
most remarkable of all , however , is the prospect of serious downhill skiing just half an hour ’s drive from @entity35			1
there is nothing unusual about snow in northern @entity53 at this time of year , of course			0
but the current cold snap has delivered an exceptionally generous dump of snow on @entity19 , a craggy old @entity58 hill fort in the heart of the @entity60			1
at 1,700 ft above sea level , it is little more than a mound by @entity65 standards and a mere pimple in the @entity68 scheme of things			0
but it is famous for its panoramic views and for the unstable shale which frequently comes cascading down a fearsome gully on its southern side , so much so that the road which used to run beneath it eventually had to be abandoned			2
this week , an intrepid band of local mountaineers noticed that the gully was covered in more snow than anyone could remember			2
so they decided to ski it			2
the dramatic photograph of @entity86 , 30 , bombing down the sort of ‘ black ’ run that would do credit to the @entity90 — while photographer @entity91 climbed up the gully with ice axes — was the shot of a lifetime			1
‘ i ’ll never take another picture like that again			0
not in the @entity60 , that ’s for sure , ’ admits @entity91 , a communications manager with the @entity96			0
suddenly , seasoned skiers and thrill - seekers were asking : where is this @entity19 place ? and when can i give it a go ? what passes for a crowd is expected this weekend			1
so , with another sunny day and sub-zero temperatures in prospect , i have come to ski the @entity111 with @entity86 as my guide			2
and i soon find a few challenges that would n’t trouble the average skier in , say , @entity115			2
in the absence of a chairlift , it ’s a half - hour trek up the hill from the @entity121 car park			1
and parts of the path are sheet ice			0
that ’s tricky enough if you are an experienced hill walker			0
if you are also carrying skis , boots and poles — and they do n’t do @entity133 in @entity20 — it ’s rather harder			1
finally , we get to the top and @entity86 takes me over to the gully			0
it ’s not so much a slope as a stomach - dropping void			2
there is a near - vertical plunge down a thin strip of snow between the rocks towards the old road below			2
an overnight avalanche has exposed a lot of fresh boulders in the gully and any attempt to replicate this week ’s famous photograph in these conditions would be suicidal			2
@entity153 - born @entity86 is no madman			2
a science graduate whose plans for a career in the @entity158 were scuppered by a climbing injury , he went into teaching , became an assistant head at the age of 24 and has now set up a legal support service for the teaching profession			0
he has climbed and skied all over the @entity165 and scaled the highest peak in @entity167			0
he even built a climbing wall at his @entity35 home and says the @entity60 has some of the best climbing anywhere			1
but before now he has never made the same claim about its skiing			1
‘ most of my friends have a pair of what we call “ @entity178 ” — old ones that you do n’t mind bashing a bit , ’ he says			0
‘ every other winter , you might get enough snow for a bit of fun up here			0
but i ca n’t remember anything as good as this			0
’ daring : @entity86 ' dramatic descent , pictured , made headlines after it was photographed this week we set off down a less treacherous slope in the direction of @entity193			1
it might not be up to @entity196 standards but it ’s a lot better than the conditions i found in several resorts while driving through the @entity165 shortly before @entity201			0
then , the pistes in places like @entity204 and chi - chi @entity205 — at more than twice the altitude of @entity19 — were little more than grass and mud ( they have enjoyed plenty of snow since then )			1
they would have been thrilled to have snow like this at the start of their season			0
whizzing down another aspect of @entity19 , past a rather startled rambler enjoying a contemplative sarnie , i come across another obstacle that does not trouble the average punter in @entity223 or @entity224 — a stile			1
but then this landscape is , arguably , prettier than any of those famous ski destinations			0
that is because every ski resort is covered in pylons , stations and cables			1
@entity19 has nothing more intrusive than a dry stone wall			1
i daresay @entity235 , @entity236 and even the dear old @entity237 can probably sleep easy , safe in the knowledge that this latest addition to the ski map of @entity241 is not going to last			0
but for one more day or two , at least , let us raise a glass of @entity244 to the @entity245 .			0

the coolest ski resort this week is the rugged @entity19 in @entity20
made front - page news when skier 's dramatic descent was photographed
it allows for serious downhill skiing just half an hour from @entity35
and it is extremely peaceful , with hardly a soul to disturb your run
