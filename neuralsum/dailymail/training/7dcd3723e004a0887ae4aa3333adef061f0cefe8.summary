despite being bathed in its rays all day , plants have a remarkable ability to avoid sunburn			0
now researchers in @entity5 have uncovered the process that makes these plants create natural sunscreen ' the harsh ultraviolet radiation plants are exposed to daily can cause serious damage to plant dna and , as a result , hinder plant growth , ' said @entity26 from @entity27			1
the latest study revealed plants produce special molecules and send them to the outer layer of their leaves to protect themselves from damaging ultraviolet rays			1
these molecules , named sinapate esters , block ultraviolet - b radiation from penetrating deeper into leaves where it might damage the plant 's development			1
' to me the beautiful thing is nature has a sunscreen itself , ' professor @entity26 told @entity48			0
researchers claim the study could help scientists create lotions that offer better protection from solar rays ' we always think the leaves want every bit of light they can get , but they have to use certain wavelengths efficiently			1
' other studies had been collecting evidence that suggests sinapate esters are protective molecules , but until now , no one has investigated what happens to them under the sun 's rays in the study , the researchers coaxed the molecules into the gas phase and exposed them to @entity75 radiation from a laser in the laboratory			1
a study has found plants can identify sounds nearby most people do n't give a second thought when tucking into a plate of salad			0
but perhaps we should be a bit more considerate when chomping on lettuce , as scientists have found that plants actually respond defensively to the sounds of themselves being eaten			2
the researchers at the @entity92 found that plants can identify sounds nearby , such as the sound of eating , and then react to the threats in their environment			2
' previous research has investigated how plants respond to acoustic energy , including music , ' said @entity103 , senior research scientist in the @entity104 at the @entity92			0
' however , our work is the first example of how plants respond to an ecologically relevant vibration			0
' we found that " feeding vibrations " signal changes in the plant cells ' metabolism , creating more defensive chemicals that can repel attacks from caterpillars			0
' they found that the particular sinapate ester that plants use as a screen against @entity75 was capable of absorbing radiation at every wavelength across the uvb spectrum			1
the natural sunblock is remarkably efficient at absorbing harsh radiation that could otherwise damage the plant			1
it 's also very similar to the sunblock humans use to protect themselves against the sun 's rays			1
as well as having a natural sunblock , separate research in @entity131 , @entity132 , found plants give off a gas when under ' attack '			2
super-sensitive microphones picked up a ' bubbling ' sound from a healthy plant			0
but this rose to a piercing screech when it was under threat			0
' the more a plant is subjected to stress , the louder the signal , ' said dr @entity147			0
plants do not actually scream in pain , but different sounds are heard when the gas they emit , ethylene , is bombarded with lasers			0
the research could help to work out which pieces of fruit and vegetables are likely to stay fresh longer , as a cucumber which is starting to go off produces a squealing sound			0
the sunblock is remarkably efficient at absorbing harsh radiation that could otherwise damage the plant			2

researchers exposed the molecules to @entity75 radiation from a laser
the molecules , named sinapate esters , block ultraviolet - b radiation
@entity175 ester absorbed radiation at every wavelength in spectrum
it 's similar to sunblock humans use to protect themselves against sun
it could help scientists create sun lotions that offer better protection
