ten years ago prince @entity0 went on gap year trip to the @entity4 - ridden southern @entity3 kingdom of @entity5 and vowed to devote the rest of his life to help the troubled children he met there			1
today he played in a $ 1million polo match in the @entity11 to raise funds for the continuing work of the charity he helped set up following that life - changing visit			1
speaking after the match to @entity18 the fourth - in - line to the throne candidly admitted that the last decade had been an ' emotional roller coaster ' but said that he was hugely proud of what they had achieved			0
indeed in 2008 the charity almost went bust , despite raising millions from the proceeds of a television documentary and a star - studded princess diana memorial concert			1
there were repeated and damaging claims that too much money was being wasted in setting up the charity 's @entity3 operation and too little being given to needy projects on the ground			2
he was playing in the @entity50 , which his team won , at the @entity51 and @entity52 the fourth - in - line ( second right ) to the throne was in the @entity54 along with @entity55 ( left ) , @entity56 ( second left ) and @entity57 ( right ) the prince told @entity18 : ' it started really really small ...			1
a very small group of us saying we ’re not going to use the funds for other people , it ’s going to be all for the kids and pretending we knew what we were doing			1
' ten years down the line we have made a couple of mistakes and in turn learned from our mistakes and now we know that actually , by speaking to the core problem , which in this case is the children themselves ...			1
you get a really good taste of whether you ’re achieving it or not			0
' the great thing about @entity5 is that because it ’s so small , you know that if you ’re doing it wrong , it ’s highly visible			1
and if you ’re doing it right , you start to see the change			2
' he said he was hugely proud of what the charity had achieved , pictured with @entity85 prince @entity0 , chairman of @entity86 and sir @entity87 ahead of the @entity50 match at the @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity91 he admitted the charity was ' quite a hard sell for a lot of people '			1
' it 's a very small country that no one knows about , surrounded by @entity98 , a landlocked country and i think that combined with us thinking that we knew what we were doing right , it evolved and it changed for the better , ' he said			2
' we realised our mistakes and we were willing to change it by speaking to the kids on the ground			2
' what i ’d like to think is that @entity31 has brought everyone together to work for one great cause			1
' he added : ' it ’s been an emotional rollercoaster but we ’ve come out on top and all i ’ve ever wanted to do was raise enough money to make a difference for @entity5			1

she said : ' i have met prince @entity0 a few times			1
i 've seen him since he was about ten			0
i have seen him grow up			0

we are looking forward to seeing him in action			0
' he plans to stay on in @entity90 this weekend to watch the @entity118 at the @entity119 @entity31 - which means forget me not and was chosen in memory of the prince 's late mother - supports children in @entity5 , a tiny , poverty - stricken kingdom in southern @entity98 with one of the highest hiv / aids rates in the world			1

weighing in at eight tonnes , it is a staggering 45 feet tall and has 1,122 lights inside that take two days to change , twice a year			0
