by @entity0 published : 08:45 est , 7 december 2012 updated : 12:05 est , 7 december 2012 a mother - of - three died after her stomach lining was punctured during weight loss surgery			1
@entity4 , 41 , had hoped the operation at @entity6 would help her go from 23 stone to 18 stone			1
but during the procedure , known as a keyhole sleeve gastrectomy , doctors failed to notice her stomach was punctured and she died 10 days later			1
@entity4 ( pictured here eight years before her death ) ied after her stomach lining was punctured during weight loss surgery during the original keyhole procedure , surgeons discovered that mrs @entity4 ’s liver was enlarged			1
lawyers later established that the surgery should have been abandoned or switched to a different type of operation , but instead it continued			1
mrs @entity4 then suffered internal bleeding and the operation had to be converted to open surgery			1
after she deteriorated following the surgery , doctors operated on her again to try and discover the cause of her feverish symptoms but could not find the leak , allowing poisonous fluids to continue to seep into her body and cause irreparable damage			1
a sleeve gastrectomy reduces the size of the stomach by about 75 per cent			0
the stomach is divided vertically from top to bottom , making it banana - shaped			0
medical literature suggests the death rate from this procedure stands at 0.05 per cent			0
the risk of damage to internal organs is said to be 1 in 1000			0
even after a third operation and repair of the leak she continued to deteriorate and died 10 days after the original surgery			1
the @entity50 reception worker left behind three children , her husband @entity52 , and a large family in @entity54			0
her heartbroken mother , @entity55 , 69 , said her daughter had thought long and hard about whether to go ahead with the surgery			0
‘ but she wanted to be healthier for the kids and wanted to know that she would be around to see them reach adulthood and one day become a grandmother herself , ’ she explained			0
‘ the gastric bypass was a last resort but sadly , because of the mistakes made , she was robbed of this			0
’ mrs @entity55 , who now cares for mrs @entity4 ’s three children , @entity66 16 , @entity67 , 13 , and @entity68 , seven , added : ‘ @entity4 ’s death has left a huge gap in all of our lives and we ’ve struggled to come to terms with the fact she has gone			1
’ last month the family won a @entity78 battle when @entity79 agreed to pay a substantial undisclosed settlement to mrs @entity4 ’s children			1
mrs @entity55 said : ‘ @entity4 and the children lived with me in south west @entity6 before her death in 2008 and we were a great team , with the children being our focus and priority			1
‘ i have tried to keep that going now she has gone			0
things will never be the same again and nothing will turn back the clock but @entity4 ’s death can not be in vain			2
‘ the settlement for the children means they can now pursue their dreams , such as going to university and enjoying the hobbies they love			0
‘ these are things that @entity4 worked so hard to try and provide for them			2
it wo n’t bring her back , but knowing they have financial security to begin to move on with their lives provides some comfort			0
’ happier times : mrs @entity4 with her mother june in 2007			2
last month @entity79 ( pictured ) agreed to pay a substantial undisclosed settlement to mrs @entity4 's children the high court judge praised mrs @entity55 for her devotion to caring for her grandchildren at the settlement approval hearing in @entity6			1
now , after winning her battle for justice , calling for @entity79 to prove lessons have been learnt to prevent anymore ‘ needless ’ deaths			0
mrs @entity55 said : ‘ we had so many questions about why @entity4 died and while the inquest and admission of liability answered some of these , i want proof that the hospital trust has done something to make sure the mistakes made can never happen again			1
’ this follows a coroner ’s request that the @entity129 investigate the trust after three deaths at @entity132 between january and june 2008 following different routine operations			0
a verdict of death by accidental adverse healthcare event was given at the inquest into @entity4 ’s death in september 2008 at @entity139			2
@entity140 , a medical law expert at @entity142 ’s @entity6 office , representing the family said : ‘ this is a tragic case that has seen three children lose their mum at an age when they were still very reliant on her			2
‘ the inquests into @entity4 ’s and two other needless deaths after operations at the @entity132 were held on the same day and the coroner urged the @entity129 and other health authorities to investigate how mistakes were allowed to happen			2
' june , @entity4 ’s children and other patients now need proof that these mistakes have been identified and learnt from to prevent any further tragedies			2
‘ it ’s bad enough that @entity4 ’s stomach was punctured but for it then to not be properly identified and repaired causing irreparable damage is simply not acceptable			1
we have repeatedly called for patient safety to be the top priority across the @entity50 and mistakes like these should not be happening			0
