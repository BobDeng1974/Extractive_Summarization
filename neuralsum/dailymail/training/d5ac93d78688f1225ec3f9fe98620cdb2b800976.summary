by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 saw his @entity4 side roundly beaten on his return to @entity6 but insists he will stick with his new formation			1
the 67 - year - old was at @entity9 for the first time since being sacked in 2012 but his @entity4 team were outclassed as @entity6 cantered to a 4 - 0 victory			1
@entity13 scored twice , with @entity14 scoring his second goal in as many weeks and @entity16 adding a fourth after the break			1
leading the way : @entity19 refuses to ditch @entity4 ' 3 - 5 - 2 system @entity21 saw his attacking players shine , especially in the first half up against the back three on which @entity2 has pinned his survival hopes			1
@entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 were given the runaround before @entity2 reacted by changing to a back four for the second half			2
despite an improved performance , with only one goal shipped , @entity2 is not ready to give up on his 3 - 5 - 2 formations			1
' i do n't know if that ( the system ) is a problem , ' he said			2
' we played okay last week playing that well , it is about energy really			2
we were slower on the ball and were off the pace a bit - in certain areas we were n't sharp enough			2
we have to work harder both with and without the ball			2
' i do n't think it is systems			2
that system allows me to get two strikers into the team which i was trying to do			0
' ( @entity52 ) @entity51 does n't play up on his own , it is difficult			0
@entity54 does n't play up on his own			0
you look to play 4 - 4 - 2 and you get slaughtered in midfield , it is not easy			1
' dejected : @entity59 and @entity26 gaze into the distance as they were roundly beaten at @entity6 easy pickings : @entity16 slid home @entity6 's fourth goal at @entity9 on sunday the size of the victory saw @entity21 's side move to the top of the @entity70 table , but the former @entity72 boss was quick to dispel any early season talk of a title tilt			1
' it is nothing , ' he replied when asked about @entity6 sitting top of the table			1
' it is two games			0
the most important thing is to try and develop our style and philosophy , ( against @entity4 ) we showed our basis			1
' for me , it is important that the team show they are a team			0
we played like a team all together and we can achieve something			0
' it is important to keep the reality and stay calm			0
if you lose two games you are in danger but we need to keep calm , it is only the beginning of the season			0
' @entity21 remains more interested on getting his style in place rather than worrying about where @entity6 sit in the standings			1
' i 'm in charge for my first season at @entity6 and at the moment we want to put in place our philosophy and play in the way that @entity6 have played in their history , ' he added			1
' we are very pleased			0
in front of our supporters and our first game of the season here it was a good game for us			0
i think we played well			0
we have players that can play in this way and we have belief			0
