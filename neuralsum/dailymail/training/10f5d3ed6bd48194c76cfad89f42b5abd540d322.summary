by @entity0 food stamps will be handed to the poorest and neediest when cash handouts are scrapped in favour of vouchers next week			1
many local authorities are expected to take part in the scheme under which vouchers will be issued to the most vulnerable , rather than cash grants or loans			1
they will be issued to help tide people over in times of financial crisis , and recipients will be able to exchange the vouchers for food , nappies and other essentials , but not alcohol or cigarettes			1
thousands of the most vulnerable people will be given vouchers redeemable for food and essentials from april the voucher scheme is being introduced from 1 april under changes to benefits outlined in last year 's @entity29			1
the food stamps will replace the discretionary part of the government - run @entity32 , which issued immediate , small cash grants and loans to people on low or no incomes who needed help urgently			1
now , instead of the money being handed out by central government , it is being devolved to local authorities in @entity44 and devolved administrations in @entity46 and @entity47			0
the current budget of £ 178.2m will be handed down to a local level , plus start - up costs of £ 72m , for councils to spend as they see fit			0
a spokesman for the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) said the move was not about cost - cutting , as there was no reduction in budget , but rather was intended to ensure the money was spent where it was most needed			0
he said : ' we ’re reforming the @entity32 because it is complex , over-centralised and poorly targeted , and replacing it with local provision to ensure this money goes to those most in need			2
vouchers will be issued to those most at need at a local level in @entity44 , @entity47 and @entity46 ( file image ) ' we will transfer the current annual funding for crisis loans and community care grants to local authorities in @entity44 and the devolved administrations in @entity47 and @entity46			1
' they will receive the full programme budget of £ 178.2 million a year in addition to administration and start - up costs of over £ 72 million which represents a fair settlement			0
' the vouchers will be adopted in the wake of the abolition of the @entity32 's discretionary scheme , under which the needy were given crisis loans , repayable out of their benefits , or community care grants			1
local authorities may offer vouchers redeemable at supermarkets , food banks , or those that may be exchanged for hot meals the @entity32 's regulated scheme , which governs cold weather payments , @entity95 maternity grants , funeral expenses and the @entity100 , will be unaffected , the @entity53 says			1
it will be up to the local authorities how they spend the money , but many of those in @entity44 are said to have confirmed their plans to issue one - off , single - use vouchers to those who apply for emergency assistance			0
some authorities are planning to hand out food parcels , and will divert extra funds to local food banks to enable them to buy more supplies and take on more staff to help			2
and others may issue the money as repayable loans , similar to the crisis loans available under the previous system			2
@entity122 council is one authority planning to offer vouchers , and a spokesman told @entity126 the council intends to use their allocation to offer a mixture of vouchers and discretionary payments			2
spokesman @entity132 said : ' these may be supermarket vouchers or electricity or gas vouchers , or they may be discretionary support payments , for example to help with housing payments or essential household items			0
' a spokesman for @entity141 said it was also planning to offer a mixture of clothing and fuel vouchers , food parcels , and emergency travel costs			0
critics said the scheme may stigmatise those already in trouble , but the government insists the plans , which will enable local authorities to set their own eligibility criteria , will mean the money will go where it is needed most .			0

vouchers will be redeemable for food , nappies and other essentials
they will be offered to needy by councils after crisis funds devolved locally
the stamps will replace @entity32 's discretionary loans and grants
