@entity1 kids suffering the effects of autism are getting a helping paw from assistance dogs			1
@entity7 's syndrome and other disorders on the autism spectrum often make it hard for sufferers to recognise mainstream social cues and form friendships			1
but new research shows dogs can provide love , empathy and companionship that is hard for autism sufferers to recognise , and help kids like @entity21 , 11 , make connections with the world			1
' he is like a therapist , a very furry therapist , ' said @entity21 's mum , @entity26			1
@entity29 is a @entity30 who was specially trained by @entity32 to give kids like @entity21 the love , empathy and companionship that they would n't normally get from their peers			1
new research has revealed children with @entity41 ( @entity41 ) can benefit from animal - assisted activities			1
this means having a dog like @entity29 around can help improve the social skills of autistic children			1
. assistance dogs have been proven to increase independence , reduce reliance on human caregivers and act as a great ice - breaker helping overcome social isolation			1
around 230,000 @entity1 are estimated to have disorders on the autism spectrum like @entity7 's , and as a result will struggle to understand normal social cues and body language , making it far more difficult to form friendships			1
assistance dogs @entity1 currently support 55 families with autistic children across @entity1 and while you might instantly think of assistance dogs performing physical tasks , ms @entity26 said @entity29 's role is far more related to emotional support			1
' if @entity21 comes home from school and he is a bit anxious or everything feels a bit too much for him , @entity29 will be right there with him			1
' ' @entity21 does n't have the ability to read others or really have a real grasp on what people are thinking from body language which is something people really take for granted , ' she said			2
@entity32 paired @entity29 and @entity21 in 2012 and since then they have formed a special bond ms @entity26 said @entity21 's first few years of school were really tough on him			2
he did n't have the chance to make many real friends and would sometimes come home in tears			2
' having a connection with others is hard for him but it 's harder to see him not having the friendships that a lot of other kids do			0
' this was until @entity21 met @entity29			2
she said once @entity29 came into their lives ' everything changed '			0
@entity29 and @entity21 had an ' immediate connection ' and it did n't take long for @entity29 to become ' part of the family '			2
' if @entity21 comes home from school and he is a bit anxious or everything feels a bit too much for him , @entity29 will be right there with him			2
' he puts his paw up on his legs and just makes him feel like everything is alright , ' she added			0
ms @entity26 said @entity29 is ' very intuitive ' to @entity21 's needs and that even if he is crying @entity110 knows exactly how to give him the emotional support that will calm him down			2
@entity29 has given @entity21 the confidence to interact with other people which seemed insurmountable before his furry therapist came along @entity21 has flourished since being given responsibility that comes with being a dog owner			2
it 's his job to keep @entity29 fed , groomed and walked			0
@entity21 's younger brother @entity119 has also been diagnosed with asperger syndrome and although their relationship can be strained at times she said it 's given @entity21 a chance to teach his brother about trust and relationships			1
@entity29 has given brothers @entity119 , left , and @entity21 , right , an opportunity to bond now they have found some common ground ' because they both have @entity7 's , they both struggle in the same social situations			1
the two boys are pretty full on but @entity29 can bring the whole tone down			0
' she said @entity29 has a natural ability to read the anxiety and stress levels in the house and always knows when to come up and say : ' hey , i 'm here and it 's going to be okay			0
' @entity21 now let 's @entity119 feed @entity29 and while they used to rub each other the wrong way she said they 've found common ground with the newest member of the family			1
ms @entity26 said @entity29 's presence has ' benefited the whole family '			0
even when things get too much for ms @entity26 , her ' furry therapist ' is always there to comfort her			0
she said one of the most challenging parts of having a child with autism is watching your child in pain knowing there 's nothing you can say to take it away , but now she said she has a lot more ' peace of mind ' knowing @entity29 can fix any problem her kids are faced with			2
animal - assisted activities provide a relatively simple and cost - effective means of helping families improve the social functioning of children with autism assistance dogs start their training at eight weeks and wo n't graduate until they are about two years old autism ( @entity41 ) is a complex neurological disorder that can cause the sufferer to have difficulty with social and communication skills			1
people with autism often have unusual ways of learning , paying attention or reacting to sensations			0
the main areas of difficulty are related to communication , social interaction and restricted or repetitive behaviours			0
because the affects can vary from individuals it has been recognised that autism has a ‘ spectrum ’ , hence @entity41			2
around 230,000 @entity1 are estimated to be on the autism spectrum			1
asperger syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder that is charachterised by difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication , alongside restricted or repetitive patterns of behaviour or interests			1
children suffering from @entity204 ’s will often show less severe symptoms with an absence of language delays , unlike children with autism			2
the notable symptoms of @entity7 ’s is a decreased ability to socialise with others , to communicate , and to use imagination			2
' i hear him come home upset from school and even when he does n't want to talk to me he will go into his room and talk to @entity29 , ' she said			0
' there are a lot of challenges and stress for us as parents but having @entity29 in the home has made it so much easier			0
' assistance dogs ceo , @entity226 said their dogs start training at eight weeks to ensure they have a ' well - rounded ' education and that nothing can scare them once they 've been placed with families			0
' they start training at eight weeks where they will work with puppy trainers for a year			0
then they get 6 months of intensive training at puppy school which is where they are socialised to make sure they wo n't react to children , ' he told @entity248			0
although this process costs about $ 27,000 per dog mr @entity226 said it 's worth every cent to see the extent dogs can improve the lives of children who are faced with a life of challenges			0
' there have been extensive studies that show if an autistic child has an emotional connection with an animal they will become more independent , their self - esteem can improve , their communication skills advance and they become more self - reliant			1
' @entity268 spend around $ 27,000 on each puppy but are happy to give them to deserving families for free he said kids who 've been given assistance dogs find their lives improve drastically because they are finally given the opportunity to participate in society without relying so heavily on carers or parents			1
' these dogs give a bit more equality to people who suffer from a range of disabilities			0
it helps them enjoy their community , allowing them to get as much out of life as they can , ' he added			0

' she said although @entity21 still does n't have a lot of friends , he is happy with his one ' special friend '			1
april 2 is @entity311 and @entity32 will be celebrating the success of their @entity314 program , which is responsible for pairing children suffering from autism with their very own therapy puppy			1
the @entity314 program not only gives out these lifetime friends but also works with parents to train family dogs to provide the same emotional support that trained assistance dogs do			0
the dogs can learn up to 50 specialised commands that will help them communicate effectively with children on the autism spectrum			1
