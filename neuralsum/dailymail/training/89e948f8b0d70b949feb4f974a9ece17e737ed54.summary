repairs to the crumbling houses of @entity2 could cost taxpayers more than £ 3billion			1
the historic @entity4 is in such poor condition that mps and peers may have to move out for five years while works are carried out			2
officials say the landmark by the @entity11 will not survive without significant investment			1
it may have to close for five years among the problems are leaking roofs and pipes , ancient electrics and plumbing , asbestos , subsidence , badly - damaged stonework and fire risks			1
the building , which has housed peers since 1847 and @entity6 since 1852 , has not had a major renovation since the 1940s , when @entity31 bomb damage was dealt with			1
@entity32 , who is leading the restoration project , said politicians and their staff would end up ‘ working in a ruin ’ if nothing was done			2
‘ we ’re moving backwards , ’ he told @entity39 ’s @entity38			2
‘ the building is getting older faster than we can deal with it			1
it is on borrowed time			2
’ restoration costs were put at about £ 1.4billion in a 2012 report			0
but sources say the ‘ working assumption ’ now is that the bill will reach £ 3billion			0
an independent report opens up the possibility of keeping the building open and mps working there while repairs are carried out			1
but this is likely to be rejected because it might extend the timetable to up to 50 years			0
a second report setting out the costs of the different options has been completed , but will not be published until after next year ’s election			0
borrowed time : repairs to the crumbling houses of @entity2 ( pictured ) could cost taxpayers more than £ 3billion mps and peers will then have to decide how the work should be carried out			0
it is expected to begin in 2020 or 2021 , and may require legislation			0
the huge cost and disruption make the decision a politically charged one and a quango similar to the @entity75 is likely to be created to oversee the project			0
parliamentary officials stress that it is impossible to put a firm figure on the cost at this stage because no decision has been taken about which option to pursue			1
the @entity4 was designed by architect @entity83 after the previous building was destroyed by fire in 1834			1
grade i listed , it has 100 staircases and more than 1,100 rooms			0
