one boss replied : ' if you ca n’t live with that risk then you ca n’t work offshore			0
' a @entity20 pilot added : ' i have to say how else are we going to get there ? it is what we do			0

model : an undated handout photograph released by @entity20 shows a @entity110 variant , the same model as the @entity20 operated helicopter that crashed in the @entity30 ' it ’s poor , poor management and they should n’t be in a job if that ’s their attitude towards their workforce			0
' the talk was meant to reassure workers about the @entity122 fleets , which had just returned to service after being grounded following safety fears when two were forced to make an emergency bail - out at sea last year			1
