by @entity0 published : 13:00 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 14:48 est , 25 october 2013 dispute : @entity2 was gunned down in the @entity3 last year , and now it has been claimed he was arguing with an unidentified man the night before a @entity7 man gunned down in the @entity3 alongside his family last year was seen in a ' heated ' argument at his camp site the previous night , according to a new report			1
@entity2 , a 50 - year - old engineer , was shot dead in his parked car along with his wife , @entity15 , and mother - in - law near the @entity18 town of @entity19 , close to the @entity21 border			1
@entity22 , a @entity18 cyclist , was also killed in the attack , though @entity25 's two daughters @entity26 , four , and @entity27 , seven , survived			2
the identity of the murderer remains a mystery			2
several campers saw @entity25 speaking with a man at @entity34 campsite			1
it is unclear what the men discussed , but sources speaking to @entity40 newspaper said the exchange was ' heated , but it was not described as vehement			2
' the source , thought to be close to the case , sounded a a further note of caution by adding that ' everyone has his own interpretation as to what constitutes a dispute according to his own culture ' , according to the @entity52			0
the @entity18 report provided more background to the incident , saying that the @entity25 family arrived in the area four days before they were attacked on 5 september 2012			1
at first they had stayed in another campsite , but they did not like the plot they were given and moved to @entity64 , where they spent their final night			2
@entity18 investigators have reportedly been looking in to who might have known the location of the campsite where they were staying , around eight miles from the site of their murder			1
the mystery surrounding the case intensified recently when prosecutors admitted they had not been able to find the @entity7 passports belonging to mr @entity25 and his wife			0
@entity79 , a prosecutor in charge of the case , told @entity40 : ' investigators searched absolutely everywhere , on the bodies , in the family caravan , in the house in @entity85 [ in @entity7 ]			0
unknown visitor : mr @entity25 was seen speaking with an unidentified man at @entity34 campsite , pictured mystery : the scene of the killing in the @entity3 last year , which was believed to target the @entity25 family road : mr @entity22 and the @entity94 were killed by an unknown assassin near @entity19 investigation : police outside mr @entity25 's home in @entity99 hunting for clues into his death ' given the timing , it ’s not impossible that the killer took the two passports ... but that would have been tight			1
' on monday a @entity108 documentary was broadcast in which mr @entity25 's brother @entity109 admitted that the two almost came to blows in an argument over how to split their father 's £ 1million estate when he died			0
@entity109 , a 54 - year - old accountant , never spoke to his brother again after the dispute , but denied hiring a hitman to kill him , despite a torrent of speculation			0
denial : @entity121 said he had nothing to do with the murder , though he admitted arguing with his brother the last time he saw him he was arrested by @entity18 police - the only person held in connection with the murder - but has been released on bail			1
he said : ‘ he pinned me down			0
i was on the bed in my bedroom and he pinned me down			0
' up to 100 officers in @entity7 and @entity18 have been focusing on several lines of inquiry linked to the family ’s complex background – they moved from @entity140 to @entity7 in 1971 – but the main theory remains that a dispute over the huge inheritance is behind the bloodbath			1
@entity109 also alleged that police have failed to properly investigate the possibility that the real target was @entity22 , a cyclist who was also shot dead during the attack on his brother			0
he said : ‘ they are covering up for someone in @entity18 in that region and they know it			2
there is something more to it locally			0
’ he has refused to go to @entity18 in order to be questioned by @entity18 police			1
@entity18 investigators believe mr @entity22 , 45 , was killed because he stumbled upon the murder scene			1
the @entity108 programme also spoke to two witnesses , who saw a motorbike and a @entity164 4x4 close to the murder scene			0
the motorcyclist was said to be the likely killer , and @entity18 authorities have since announced they will release an e-fit image of the man			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
