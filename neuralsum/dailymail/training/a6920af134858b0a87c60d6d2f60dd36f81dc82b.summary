an outdated three - reel slot machine is drawing in bigger crowds than a @entity3 show at @entity5 casino @entity4			1
the @entity6 has failed to produce a single jackpot in almost 20 years , and has attracted a legion of dedicated gamblers who believe it 's going to pay out millions of dollars any day			1
the @entity6 is the lone survivor of a slew of $ 1 progressive slot machines from the early 1990s			1
growing daily : the @entity6 and its ever - growing jackpot according to @entity17 law , slot machines are required to pay out 75 per cent of the money that goes in to them			1
therefore , the @entity6 is n't going anywhere , at least not until somebody wins the jackpot			2
the machine is the oldest three - reeled slot on the @entity26 gaming floor and has the highest level of ' occupancy , ' or daily time played , of all 1,900 of the casino 's machines , @entity32 , the @entity26 's executive director of slots , told the @entity34			2
the cult slot machine even has a @entity37 page and a @entity39 account with the description : ' tracking the @entity41 â€“ the progressive slot machine that still has n't hit ! ' ' this game probably gets played about five times more than the average game on our casino floor , ' @entity32 told the @entity34 , adding that staff are constantly being asked where the machine is by curious visitors			1
hot slot : the @entity6 is @entity26 's most - played slot machine @entity52 : the machine pays out smaller prizes on a regular basis but the jackpot remains elusive numerous other social media forums track the lucrative machine 's payouts			1
unlike the newer machines surrounding it , the @entity6 has old - fashioned levers gamblers pull and just a modest sign advertising its jackpot total			2
rumor has it that so desperate is the casino to be rid of it that whoever wins the jackpot will also get to take home the @entity6			0
with each passing year the slot machine 's fame grows and so does the jackpot			2
desperately seeking : many come to @entity5 with the sole intention of winning the @entity6 jackpot and sit on the machine for hours at a time it 's now at $ 2.3 million , having taken the money of a generation of gamblers and drawing in a whole new one along the way			1
@entity81 , 34 , is one such gambler			0
' i 'm not normally like this , but with this machine , i talk to it			0
whenever a lion comes up , i rub it			0
i know it 's strange , but the machine has this juju about it , ' @entity81 told the @entity34			0
the @entity92 , @entity94 native says she 's constantly on tenterhooks that somebody else will score the big prize and monitors the machine 's payouts constantly			0
' every time you get an email notification you 're like oh s * * *			0
did somebody win ? ' she says .			0

a slot machine in @entity5 is *harboring* a $ 2.3 million jackpot
