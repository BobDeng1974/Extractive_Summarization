by @entity0 and @entity1 dangerous precedent : @entity4 mp @entity3 said @entity5 must be given a chance to debate whether aa major terrorism trial should be held in secret mps from across the political spectrum yesterday condemned plans to hold a major terrorism trial in secret and called for an urgent parliamentary debate on the growing controversy			1
the case – in which a judge declared he would try two suspected terrorists entirely behind closed doors – was described as a ‘ dangerous precedent ’ which will change the @entity22 legal landscape forever			1
his momentous decision – a legal first – was revealed only after this newspaper and other media organisations challenged it at the @entity27			1
last night , @entity4 mp @entity3 , who sits on the @entity28 , said @entity5 must be given a chance to debate such an important matter			0
‘ @entity31 should be very concerned indeed that the proceedings are to be held entirely in private for the first time in centuries , ’ he said			0
‘ if this goes ahead , it may well be the case that in future the argument will be made that there is justification for other cases to be so heard			0
‘ i would n’t challenge the fact that some of the evidence may be sensitive and there is an argument for some of the evidence to be taken in private , but to take the whole case in private is , to say the least , unfortunate			0
’ other trials , often involving spies or state secrets , have been held partly in secret			1
the two men , known only as @entity58 and @entity59 , are due to enter a dock at the @entity61 on june 16 accused of a terror plot			1
the trial judge , mr @entity63 , has ruled the case will be held in secret and the public will not even know the men ’s names for unknown ‘ national security ’ reasons			1
a draconian gagging order , which prevented the media reporting even the existence of the case , was overturned at the @entity27 by three top judges			0
they are now considering whether to uphold the secrecy bid			0
yesterday , justice secretary @entity77 insisted he is ‘ very confident ’ the judges will act in the ‘ interests of justice ’			1
he told the @entity81 : ‘ i know our senior judiciary very well			0
i know that they will want to protect the interests of justice , and i am very confident that if they take a decision on a very difficult matter like this , they will do so in the interests of justice			1
outspoken : judge sir @entity91 the top judge behind @entity22 ’s first ever secret trial has been an outspoken advocate of open justice throughout his career			1
sir @entity91 is an expert on media law and co-author of several books in which he makes clear justice must be seen to be done			1
and he has previously boasted that the courts , unlike the machinations of government , are not ‘ swathed in secrecy ’			0
but sir @entity91 , referred to in court as mr @entity63 , also points out that the right to an open trial is ‘ not unqualified ’			2
writing five years ago , he said a trial could be held wholly or partly in secret for national security reasons , to uphold public order or even in the ‘ interests of morals ’			2
mr @entity63 has presided over a series of high profile trials , including the acquittal of a @entity118 man accused of murdering pc @entity119 earlier this year			0
' in this particular case , if there is really good reason , if it is in the interests of justice for the judge to decide in one way or the other , so be it			2
’ but mps and campaigners said they have grave reservations that secret justice could leave lingering uncomfortable questions over the outcome of the trial			1
@entity136 , a former home secretary , said he was ‘ mystified ’ by the decision , and that it amounted to a ‘ removal of open justice ’			1
@entity136 , a former home secretary , said he was ' mystified ' by the decision ‘ in some cases , there can be justification in terms of the kind of evidence which requires presenting in secret , but it would appear that there is no clarification as to whether this is the case here , ’ he said			1
@entity154 mp @entity153 branded secret trials ‘ illiberal and @entity156 ’			2
‘ the government must explain why this is necessary to protect national security , ’ he said			0
@entity159 , a @entity161 peer and a former director of public prosecutions , said justice must be seen to be done ‘ 99.9 per cent of the time ’ , but added ‘ exceptional circumstances ’ could justify the secrecy			2
labour justice spokesman @entity167 said the courts must find a way to lift the ‘ cloak of secrecy ’ as much as possible to avoid public confidence being undermined			2
he added : ‘ while there will always be exceptional circumstances in which parts of cases may need to be held in secret , very important questions need answering as to why in this instance the whole case needs be held in secret			2
’ the @entity27 ruling will be made public ‘ within days ’			0
last night , @entity183 , the @entity184 , said the media is ‘ absolutely right ’ to challenge the secrecy			0
he said : ‘ we ’ve always operated on the principle that justice must not only be done , but be seen to be done			0
’ but he added ‘ there is no reason it should n’t be a fair trial ’ because a jury , the judge and defendants will all hear the evidence against them			0

the legal first has drawn ire from politicians across the parties
two men , known only as @entity58 and @entity59 will be tried in secret at @entity61
former home secretary called it a ' removal of open justice '
