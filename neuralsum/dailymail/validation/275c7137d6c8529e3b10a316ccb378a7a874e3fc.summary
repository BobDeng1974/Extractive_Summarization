standing in the middle of a pitch with a crowd of around 40,000 questioning your fitness and ability to get decisions right is a real test of mental strength			0
having a group of athletic , testosterone - fuelled players surrounding you , trying to intimidate and bully you into making a decision which favours them , is almost too much to bear			2
and i am incredulous that @entity15 and @entity16 seem to think this harassment of referees is now somehow acceptable			2
@entity16 ( centre ) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following @entity23 's first - half challenge in november 2006 i reported @entity24 and their players for attempting to intimidate me during a game at @entity27			1
i asked the @entity28 to study a specific incident , which was clear on video , when i felt intimidated and pressurised to give a decision			0
the @entity28 reviewed the footage and said as i did not look frightened or intimidated , they would not be taking the case any further			0
@entity24 captain @entity16 is sent off by referee @entity35 during a match with @entity27 in 2006 @entity24 captain @entity16 ( left ) reacts after @entity23 's tackle on @entity37 in the first - half at @entity39 the @entity24 players surround referee @entity41 at @entity39 as he brandishes the red card this is not a case of @entity24 - bashing , although it was their players again who demonstrated that apparently anything is acceptable now in the pursuit of winning a football match			1
ganging up on referees is happening more and more and unless something is done to reverse the trend , it will get worse			0
we have former @entity57 captain @entity16 saying that hounding a referee is ok because everyone does it			2
on wednesday night i am sure that @entity62 referee @entity41 was influenced after being harassed by @entity24 ’s outfield players			1
there was nothing in his body language to suggest he was about to reach for his red card and send off @entity70 ’s @entity23 until all that pressure was brought to bear			1
@entity24 's players surround referee @entity41 as he sends off @entity23 ( second right ) some observers will suggest that referees could just brandish cards at players who apply too much pressure			1
however , players know that there is no credibility in showing multiple yellow cards at such incidents			0
instead , the time has come to rule that only the captains should be allowed to approach the referee .			0

@entity24 players *swarmed* referee @entity41 to influence a red card for @entity70 *striker* @entity23 during their @entity92 exit
@entity95 *pundit* @entity94 branded their *behavior* a ' *disgrace* '
however @entity101 captain @entity16 *defended* his side 's actions
