@entity9 sources said the pair had a ‘ candid ’ exchange over the prospect of arch - federalist @entity13 becoming president of the @entity16			1
mr @entity2 has warned that @entity17 could leave the @entity18 if he fails in his bid to block mr @entity13 ’s appointment , which is backed by mrs @entity3			1
@entity2 and @entity3 had a ' candid ' meeting last night over who should become the next president of the @entity16 mr @entity2 and mrs @entity3 sat across the table from one another at a breakfast meeting of @entity27 leaders this morning the @entity29 prime minister and @entity31 chancellor are usually close allies , including on future reform of @entity7			1
just yesterday mrs @entity3 gave a speech criticising those urging @entity17 to leave the @entity18			1
she told @entity31 mps it was ' grossly negligent , actually unacceptable , how easily some talk about it not mattering whether @entity17 agrees or not , even whether @entity17 remains a member of the @entity18 or not			1
this is anything but irrelevant , unimportant or trivial			0
' however , she later met mr @entity2 for a bilateral meeting at the @entity27 summit in @entity45 , where the pair had a frank exchange of views			1
they have been at loggerheads over the choice of a successor to @entity53 - with mr @entity2 vehemently opposed to mrs @entity3 's favoured candidate , the arch - federalist former prime minister of @entity55 @entity13			1
a no 10 source said : ‘ they had friendly , candid and constructive discussions in keeping with how their bilaterals usually are and in the spirit of finding consensus			0
’ mr @entity2 had further discussions today on the issue with mr @entity53 , president of the @entity66 @entity65 and @entity68 prime minister @entity67 , no 10 said			2
@entity3 is pushing for arch - federalist @entity13 ( left ) to become the new @entity16 president , but @entity72 chief @entity71 ( second left ) has emerged as a compromise candidate favoured by @entity2			1
other politicians in line for @entity7 's most powerful position include @entity78 pm @entity77 and @entity80 taoiseach @entity79 @entity13 is the favourite to become the new @entity16 president - replacing the outgoing former @entity83 prime minister @entity53			1
the former @entity55 prime minister was chosen as the candidate for the top job by the @entity88 's main conservative group , the @entity87			0
the @entity87 emerged from last week 's elections with the most seats - leaving mr @entity91 in poll position for the @entity18 's most powerful job			2
but the @entity16 president is chosen by @entity7 leaders including @entity2 - and not by the @entity88			1
@entity96 do however have to confirm the leaders ' choice for the job in a vote			0
the other candidates for the top @entity18 job include the @entity72 chief @entity71			0
miss @entity71 was finance minister under former president @entity103 before moving to the @entity72 at the height of the euro zone 's debt crisis in 2011 to replace disgraced @entity108 politician @entity107			0
her term runs until 2016			0
a fluent @entity111 - speaker who headed a major @entity113 law firm before holding ministerial office in @entity108 , she is highly regarded by @entity31 leader @entity3			1
center - left @entity78 prime minister @entity77 is also under consideration			0
the former @entity96 is the daughter - in - law of @entity117 , the ex @entity118 leader and @entity7 commissioner			2
if mrs @entity3 was open to a @entity108 candidate for one of the top jobs , @entity120 might offer @entity124 former prime minister @entity125 - a fluent @entity31 - speaker who was replaced in march but is well regarded in @entity126			1
another candidate for the @entity16 president is the current @entity80 taoiseach @entity79			1
the @entity130 leader became @entity80 's leader in 2011 , so might be open to moving to @entity45			0
mrs @entity3 appeared to offer mr @entity2 a lifeline last night with a speech warning against letting @entity17 leave the @entity18 , but they remain at loggerheads over the @entity16 job mr @entity2 seemed to be getting on better with @entity113 president @entity137 during a working session of the @entity27 summit in @entity45 @entity27 leaders have gathered in @entity45 for a summit , including ( @entity142 ) @entity68 's prime minister @entity67 , @entity145 's prime minister @entity144 , @entity113 president @entity137 , president of the @entity66 @entity65 , @entity31 's chancellor @entity3 , @entity17 's prime minister @entity2 , head of the @entity16 @entity53 , @entity108 's president @entity148 and @entity150 's prime minister @entity149 the summit is supposed to focus on @entity152 and ensuring economic growth , but the @entity7 leaders have remained focussed on the future direction of the @entity18 mrs @entity3 has insisted she is ‘ trying to ensure that @entity13 receives the qualified majority he needs to become the next president of the @entity16 ’			1
but her comments suggest she does not believe mr @entity13 can command a majority among @entity7 leaders			2
@entity68 , @entity161 , the @entity162 and @entity163 are among a number of @entity18 countries said to share mr @entity2 ’s concerns about the @entity167			2
mr @entity2 has branded mr @entity13 a ‘ face from the 1980s ’ who no - one has heard of			1

mrs @entity3 is reported to have sounded out @entity108 president @entity148 about nominating @entity174 for the @entity16 job			1
miss @entity71 , who will travel to @entity176 on @entity72 business tomorrow , would be a popular candidate in both the @entity29 and @entity31			2
