a leopard never changes its spots			0
but now he ’s going to get a softer time inside			0
’ speaking from his home in @entity119 , he added : ‘ they are moving him to a softer prison and did n’t even let us know			0
out of courtesy i would hope we would have been notified			0
‘ he ’s got around three - and - a - half years to go in prison			2
surely this is too early to de-categorise him to @entity44 ? ‘ with his money and contacts it must make it easier for him to attempt to escape			0

@entity0 was then placed in a van where he was handcuffed to a guard and driven from @entity43 to @entity135			1
