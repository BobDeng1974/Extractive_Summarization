evidence has emerged of a wartime blunder that resulted in millions of pounds of @entity3 bullion , supposedly bound for @entity4 , being lost in the river @entity6			1
the gold and silver bars had been loaded in @entity9 onto a former @entity11 ferry , converted into a battle cruiser with her superstructure stripped to take part in a dangerous @entity17 convoy			2
the bullion was to pay the @entity4 for arms shipped to @entity3 during one of the most crucial stages of the @entity21			1
but as a delicate operation began to transfer the cases of treasure onto a waiting boat , one slipped and fell into the muddy waters			1
such a veil of secrecy existed over the whole operation it is not known if it was ever recovered			2
in fact , the incident has only come to light thanks to a secret diary kept by one of the @entity50 @entity23 's engineers , and now revealed by his daughter for the first time in a new book			1
@entity56 man @entity55 served on the @entity50 queen on four convoys to and from @entity9 and @entity59 in @entity3 's extreme northwest			1
mr @entity55 had got into the habit of keeping copious notes and sketches during his pre-war role as a crewman on the research ship @entity66 in the @entity67			1
he had joined the @entity66 as a 17 - year - old in his native @entity69			2
he continued his writings on the @entity71 - but aware that should any of his diaries be discovered he would be in serious trouble , he wrote in code and secreted them well			1
before he died in 2000 , aged 88 , he transcribed some of them into four @entity79 journals , which his daughter , @entity80 , has now edited into a book			2
@entity56 man @entity55 served on the @entity50 queen on four convoys to and from @entity3 's extreme northwest @entity80 , 61 , a retired school teacher , said yesterday : ' the story about the @entity3 bullion is fascinating			1
it must be documented somewhere , but i have never been able to find out what happened afterwards			0
' according to her father 's notes , there had been ' a peculiar silence all through the ship ' as she was loaded in @entity3			2
no one was allowed on deck , no one was allowed along the alleyways forward of the engine room , and no one off the mess decks unless they were on watch			0
mr @entity55 recorded : ' no scuttles [ were ] allowed to be opened , but someone got a gleek out and saw mighty big steam locomotives smothered in soldiers , up and down the cleared area of the track , hundreds of them , all with rifles and many with @entity111 guns			1
' our guards lined the deck , we later heard , either side of a small derrick which handled the paravanes [ mine detectors ]			0
a huge , dark wagon was coaxed , nudged , and jogged until the derrick 's fall was hanging vertically and a rope net was placed on the ground			0
' officers approached the wagon and examined locks and bolts [ with ] armed troops literally surrounding it			0
then began the laborious manual exercise of [ unloading ] what looked like ammunition boxes , which required two men to lift			0
' surely this was n't small arms ammunition ! not with our own guards and hundreds of troops watching it loaded into us			0
it was bullion ! ' two boxes were enough to load the sling and up they went , deposited on our deck , from where each one was slid and lowered down into the ' @entity146 ' magazine , never out of sight of at least one officer			2
' this was the arrangement so that the millions could be spent in the @entity4 to arm the @entity3			0
' ' then into the @entity150 [ went the ] harassed officials , who , we heard , lashed into the whisky " as if it were free			0
" probably , with all that off their hands , they could afford to			0
' once back in the @entity6 , after ' a fast run down the @entity159 ' , calamity was to come , however			1
mr @entity55 wrote : ' it was very late when we saw the welcoming but shaded lights of the @entity164 vessels , hauling left and right to usher us through the widening but regulated aperture , and suddenly the serenity of approaching a hallowed anchorage and being met by a small but important armada and a lighter			1
' for the next hour it was cloak - and - dagger stuff again , no one allowed on the upper deck forward of the @entity150 or on the working alleyways			0
we heard that troops and all sorts were organised to receive the bullion from where it had been man - handled onto the upper deck			2
' the paravane derrick was reeved [ threaded ] and a wire was taken with snatch blocks to a winch			0
the first two boxes were slung with a hemp rope - sling			0
mr @entity55 , who died in 2000 aged 88 , pictured with his late wife @entity190 in 1996 ' in the shaded lights were many officials , officers , men in good suits , bayonets , torches , clipboards , tarpaulins , surreptitious smokers , but nary an onlooker			1
' our captain anxiously peered over the port wing of the bridge , his nose barely over the canvas dodger , to observe the last rites of the @entity3 bullion			2
' and then it happened			0
the first boxes , two in number , were being hauled toward the lighter , and who knows what happened , but one slipped and fell with a resounding thump and a splash into the @entity6			1
' i was told on good authority that it was nothing so much as resembling a @entity221 cartoon			0
needless to say , all were to blame according to what was imparted as a result of this shocking affair			0
' the rest was capably transferred to a lighter , various bits of paper signed , exchanged , and pocketed , and a tug chuffed up to pull the lighter clear			2
' written in the diaries left for his daughter , mr @entity55 said : ' i was thankful to keep all these years , the actual daily scroll of some of the harrowing times i found myself in , especially the runs in the arctic waters so fraught with danger , both man - made and that of nature			1
' @entity80 said of the gold : ' who knows , it may still be there			0
' mr @entity55 wrote in his diary how the crew of the @entity50 @entity23 had hoped their ship would be chosen to steam straight for @entity4 , so they could ' live it up ' for a few days before returning to war - torn @entity251			1
in the end , the decision was apparently made to off - load the cargo in the @entity6 , for eventual transfer to another vessel for the @entity258 crossing			1
the @entity23 pictured in her pre-war days as an @entity11 ferry			1
she was later converted into a battle cruiser with her superstructure stripped			0
