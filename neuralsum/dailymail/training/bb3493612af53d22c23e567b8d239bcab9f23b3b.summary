the decision to award the @entity1 for the @entity3 's best player to @entity5 forward @entity4 has been greeted with surprise in many quarters			1
@entity4 performed well in the group stages , scoring four goals in three games against @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 but his star has faded since , with the @entity16 star failing to find the net in knockout matches against @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
in the final against @entity22 , @entity4 flashed one gilt - edged opportunity wide but otherwise struggled to influence proceedings			1
@entity45 ( @entity22 ) - again a standout at a major tournament , he found the net on five occasions and was a constant threat for the eventual winners			2
@entity52 ( @entity5 ) - different class in the middle of midfield as he took each game , particularly in the knockout stages , by the scruff of the neck and roared the @entity60 on			2
completed the most tackles of anyone at the @entity3			0
@entity63 ( @entity22 ) - @entity64 , beware			1
this man is the very definition of a sweeper - keeper			0
barely put a foot wrong all tournament with a string of top saves and bossed his area like no other			0
@entity75 ( @entity21 ) - although there were simulation antics , @entity75 's poise in possession and potency in front of goal were deciding factors in @entity84 's team finishing third			0
nonetheless , after the final whistle , he was presented with the @entity86 , ahead of other leading contenders such as @entity39 's @entity38 , @entity21 's @entity75 and @entity88 trio @entity63 , @entity89 and @entity45			1
it has led the conspiracy theorists to suggest that @entity4 , an ambassador for adidas , may have been granted preferential treatment , although it should be noted that the @entity88 firm also have links with @entity37 star @entity38 and they manufacture @entity22 kits			1
further speculation was triggered when it emerged that for the first time the @entity1 was decided by @entity100 's @entity99 , rather than by a media vote			0
the general consensus , however , remains that @entity4 was a little fortunate to receive the award and that his name and reputation may have earned him the prize			2
former @entity108 captain @entity107 said on the @entity109 : ' i would have gone with @entity38			2
he has played that exciting , attacking football and he has been trying to hurt the opposition			0
@entity4 has had some magic moments but you want them consistently			0
' speaking on his final appearance as a @entity109 pundit , @entity115 echoed @entity107 's sentiments , stating : ' i did n't think @entity4 has done enough			1
four or five of the @entity88 have played better over the tournament			0
' it 's all over : @entity4 looks to the ground after @entity22 win the @entity3 at the @entity34 that 's how it 's done : @entity124 scores the winner for @entity22 in extra-time to claim the @entity3			1

@entity22 defeated @entity5 1 - 0 in extra-time to win the @entity3 final
@entity4 won the @entity1 award for player of the 2014 tournament
@entity63 was handed the @entity136 award for best *goalkeeper*
@entity38 won the @entity44 for scoring most goals with six
@entity4 failed to score after group stages so it was a surprise to many many , *including* @entity107 and @entity115 , he won award for best player
