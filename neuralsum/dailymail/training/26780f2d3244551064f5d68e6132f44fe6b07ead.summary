the last portrait of @entity2 , which shows her relaxing on a deckchair in the @entity5 garden of the @entity25 , has been revealed today most poignant of all , it is also the spot where her ashes will be buried , alongside those of her beloved husband , @entity32			1
the portrait is the sixth of @entity2 by artist @entity35 , a postman ’s son who became her close friend during scores of sittings over more than a decade			1

the former prime minister stood in the zoo ’s ‘ @entity49 ’ as one of the silverbacks charged the glass screen behind which she was standing , unflinching			0
mr @entity35 , 61 , known for acclaimed portraits of the @entity55 and @entity56 , described how the ‘ in retirement ’ portrait of @entity2 came about			1
‘ i always thought there was a softer , more retiring side to her that was worth recording and whenever i went to see her without my brushes , she would look crestfallen			0
so we came up with the ‘ ‘ in retirement ’ ’ theme			0
i thought it would be lovely to paint her outside , in the sun surrounded by flowers			0
artist @entity35 proudly shows off the portrait of @entity2 ‘ when we mentioned it to her , she said , “ retirement ? ” in that formidable way of hers			1
but she soon warmed to the idea			0
’ the book she is reading is @entity82 ’s biography of her @entity84 press secretary , sir @entity83			0
‘ she knew all the stories about her , but liked reading them again , ’ said @entity35			2
the setting of the @entity88 , a retirement and nursing home for @entity92 soldiers , the so - called ‘ @entity6 ’ , was chosen because @entity2 and husband @entity32 used to worship in its chapel every sunday			2
@entity2 and @entity35 visit the gorilla enclosure at @entity43 in 2007 in 2009 , she established the @entity96 there			1
a portrait of @entity2 by @entity99 hangs in the 125 - bed infirmary , which is the hospital ’s care home , hospice and gp surgery			2

he told her how he had spent three years flying back and forth to @entity107 to paint a portrait of @entity109 , a 42 - year - old gorilla who communicates to humans via sign language			0
he said : ‘ she was absolutely fascinated and it led to us going together on a private visit to the @entity43 ’s @entity49 early one morning			0
@entity2 stood at the glass wall , completely unperturbed as a giant silverback hurled itself at the screen			2
’ @entity35 said of his friendship with @entity2 : ‘ we used to talk about our upbringing , home cooking , making a sunday roast last for half the week , the joys of @entity127 , all sorts of things			1
‘ when i showed her a recipe for @entity127 , she noticed it included beer and said , “ i do n’t have any beer in the house , would gin do ? ” when i went to @entity136 i brought back a sheet of new stamps with @entity139 on them and gave them to her			0
she asked to keep them because “ he was a very nice man ”			0
‘ we would talk about her favourite shows , @entity147 and @entity148 , and i would get her @entity150 videos			2
she would often sing to me , totally unabashed			0
’ @entity35 acted as a go - between for @entity2 and another of his subjects , @entity56			1
‘ i would take greetings from her to @entity56 , and when i saw him in @entity154 , he would ask me to return the compliment			2
’ @entity35 ’s five previous portraits of @entity2 have raised more than £ 330,000 for her favourite causes			1
