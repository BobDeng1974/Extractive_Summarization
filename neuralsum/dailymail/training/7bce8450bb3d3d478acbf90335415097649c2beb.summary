@entity0 is due to find out today whether she faces a retrial for the murder of @entity5 student @entity3			1
@entity7 supreme court judges are expected to decide if ‘ @entity0 ’ and her ex-boyfriend @entity9 should be retried – or whether their acquittal in 2011 should be confirmed			2
@entity3 , 21 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , was found semi-naked with her throat cut in the bedroom of the house she shared with @entity15 and two other women in the hilltop town of @entity18 in november 2007			1
final hurtle : @entity0 , seen here in 2009 , faces one last judgement day tomorrow when the @entity7 @entity22 considers whether the appeal that freed her should be upheld demanding answers : @entity25 , left , said the @entity7 @entity22 must answer questions about the 2007 murder of her sister @entity3 , right yesterday @entity3 ’s sister @entity29 said : ‘ there are lots of questions without answers and that ’s why we are looking for the truth			1
‘ we miss @entity3 terribly and nothing will bring her back			2
‘ we hope that the supreme court hearing will help to find some answers to what happened that night			0
‘ we still get messages of support from all over the world			0
@entity3 will never be forgotten but it ’s also important not to forget what happened , a beautiful young girl , my little sister , taken away from us too early in a brutal manner , with many aspects to still clarify			2
’ @entity15 , 25 , and @entity9 , 29 tomorrow , are said to be anxiously awaiting the outcome of the hearing in @entity52			1
the case will be decided purely on paperwork and legal documents with no new witness evidence and neither @entity15 nor @entity9 will be in court			1
since returning to @entity58 after serving four years of her sentence , @entity15 has written a book about her imprisonment and is due to give an interview to @entity66 tv station @entity65 next month ahead of its release			1
judgement day : @entity15 , 25 , and her former boyfriend @entity9 were acquitted and freed in 2011 , though they could face trial again if the @entity22 rules there is enough evidence judges will rule whether their are grounds for a new trial or if the case against them should uphold the appeal verdict of october 2011 which cleared them of the murder after they had initially been found guilty in 2009 , with @entity15 getting 26 years and @entity9 , 25 years in jail			1
the case made headlines around the world amid tales of sex games and drugs and there were traumatic scenes when they were convicted initially and when they were cleared after a fresh hearing heard how the police investigation had been bungled and was riddled with flaws			0
defence lawyers and experts acting for the pair revealed how evidence had been contaminated or poorly handled by forensic teams and that the conviction should be considered unsafe			0
they were immediately freed with @entity15 returning to her home in @entity58 while @entity9 went back to @entity103 on the southern @entity7 coast near @entity105			2
under @entity7 law there are three tiers of the judicial system and monday 's hearing in @entity52 will be behind closed doors with neither of them in attendance , with only their lawyers representing them			0
a panel of judges will rule whether the @entity7 legal code was applied correctly and fairly in both trials and if they find grounds they can order a retrial - as prosecutors in @entity18 have demanded - or they can close the case completely			0
images of @entity15 and @entity9 embracing after @entity25 was murdered made the trial even more sensational the case will be decided purely on paperwork and legal documents with no new witnesses giving evidence and neither of them will be in court			1
@entity131 , @entity15 's lawyer , said : ' she is very anxious about the hearing but she is waiting for it knowing full well that the outcome is very important			2
' @entity9 has also written a book and has already given an interview on @entity7 tv about the case where he said he and @entity15 were no longer lovers but they were still in touch			1
he visited her earlier this year and they speak on @entity144 regularly			0
he is now studying in @entity145 and they have always insisted they are innocent of @entity149 student @entity3 's murder			1
she had only been in @entity7 for two months before she was killed having arrived from @entity10 for a year long course as part of her degree			0
his father @entity152 said : ' he is working hard on his studies			0
he 's working on a project involving the movement of surgical instruments during operations			0
he is calm and serene even if we are all in a state of apprehension			0
' during the investigation and trial , much was made of @entity15 's character , with prosecutors saying she was highly sexual and had manipulated @entity9 but her lawyers dismissed the theory			1
drifter @entity3 is serving 16 years for the murder having initially being sentenced to 30 but this was later reduced on appeal .			0

@entity15 and @entity9 will find out if they are to stand trial again
@entity3 's sister @entity29 hopes for answers
@entity15 has written a book about her trial and has an @entity65 interview ahead of it 's release next month
