it was the high point of their young careers			0
as silver confetti rained down , the @entity4 players took their turn to lift the @entity8 trophy towards the cloudless @entity10 sky			1
each was cheered to the echo by their team - mates and the crowd			2
their 3 - 2 victory over @entity16 in @entity17 meant another piece of silverware for the ever - expanding cabinet at @entity4 ’s academy			1
it will be seen there as affirmation of the superiority of the @entity27 production line			0
they are the defending under 21 @entity30 champions and the holders of the @entity32 , which they will put on the line against @entity34 next week in their fifth final in six seasons			2
two goal hero @entity37 holds aloft the trophy as @entity4 win the @entity39 goal scorers @entity41 ( left ) and @entity37 pose with their medals in their mouths after sealing victory @entity4 's under 19 squad celebrate their @entity47 victory after an impressive campaign the @entity49 defeated teams of the calibre of @entity52 and @entity53 to reach the final and now , at @entity57 standard , they are officially the best team in @entity58 after their free - scoring attack found the net 36 times in 10 matches en route to victory			1
but here comes the real test of @entity4 ’s academy			1
how many of these talented tyros will graduate to @entity69 ’s first - team in the next year or two ? will @entity41 , the @entity70 under 18 striker whose goal in the final took his season ’s @entity8 tally to a tournament - best 12 , be challenging @entity75 for a place in the coming seasons ? will @entity37 , given a tantalising taste of first - team involvement when named on the bench for sunday ’s match at @entity82 before flying back to captain the team and score twice here , be absorbed into @entity69 ’s forward line ? @entity37 , who was snatched away from @entity88 's youtyh system , fired home to give @entity4 the lead @entity37 races off to celebrate his opening strike closely followed by his @entity4 team - mates @entity41 , @entity37 and the elegant central midfielder @entity94 have all been involved in the first - team squad , grabbing minutes here and there , but we all wait and wonder whether they will become regulars			1
coach @entity101 struck an optimistic tone : ‘ do i feel they ’re getting closer ? yes			0
do i feel players from this group will come through ? yes			0
i ’m confident of that			0
‘ you ca n’t have a team that ’s won as much as it has and have the different range of qualities and strengths as we have and not feel confident some will come through			0
‘ @entity114 ( @entity113 ) have got minutes this season but it is all right getting minutes , they ’ve got to get to the next stage			0
’ and it is in getting players to that next stage that @entity4 , so far at least , have struggled			2
while many of their academy products have gained minutes here and there , you have to go back to @entity126 to find a bona fide first - teamer who has come through the ranks			2
@entity37 is mobbed on the floor as team - mates rush to congratulate him for his opener @entity16 drew level when @entity49 defender @entity113 ( centre ) scored an own goal in the first - half take a look at the side that played in the 2010 @entity32 triumph over @entity141			1
centre back @entity142 made nine senior appearances for @entity4 before spending time on loan at @entity145 and @entity146			2
he was sold to @entity147 in 2013			0
@entity148 , the midfielder tipped as @entity70 ’s next great hope , is currently at @entity150 in @entity151 , his fifth loan spell in three years			0
now 22 , his chance at @entity4 has long passed			1
@entity154 scored in @entity4 ’s 2012 @entity32 final win over @entity156			1
now 20 , he is at @entity157 , his fifth loan spell in the last three seasons			0
leading scorer @entity41 put @entity4 back in the lead shortly after the interval with a close range header @entity4 striker @entity41 wheels away after netting in the @entity49 ' 3 - 2 victory over @entity16 @entity41 celebrates his goal with the impressive @entity166 who provided the assist @entity41 leaps for joy after handing @entity4 the lead while becoming the tournament 's top scorer @entity37 completed his brace with a drilled shot from outside the area in the second half @entity4 's rising star goes to celebrate with team - mate @entity177 after netting the eventual winner @entity4 youth manager @entity179 rallies his troops from the touchline the @entity184 @entity183 , also in that team , is now at @entity185 in @entity186 after loan spells at @entity188 and @entity150			1
all of the above were tipped for @entity4 stardom and are still on the waiting list			0
it now remains to be seen if @entity4 ’s latest generation of talented youngsters can buck the trend and break the mould by catching @entity69 ’s eye			2
@entity200 attacking midfielder @entity166 , who set up two goals for the @entity49 during the match , takes a free - kick @entity4 youngsters , led by @entity203 , begin their celebrations by raising aloft the trophy @entity4 players pose with the trophy in the changing room after the victory over @entity16 on monday			1

@entity4 's @entity212 side were crowned @entity8 champions
they defeated @entity215 3 - 2 in the final on monday
despite @entity4 's *successful* academy , very few graduate to the first - team
@entity37 , @entity41 and @entity222 represent the best chance the club has of bucking the trend
