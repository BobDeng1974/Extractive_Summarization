charity runners taking part in a 10km fun run at the weekend were left exhausted after being sent on an unscheduled two - mile detour			1
the blunder was believed to have been caused by a race marshal taking a toilet break during the event , missing 300 runners who should have been directed at a junction point			1
instead they continued past the unmanned marshall point and had to run for an extra three kilometres while the other 900 competitors followed the correct route			0
' a local authority spokesman said that it was investigating what happened to the marshal who should have directed runners at a turning point			2
it was reported that some runners were ' in tears ' while one described the event 's organisation as ' shambolic '			1

' in 33 years of running ... this is the first time this has happened and as part of our debrief we will be analysing the arrangements carefully ... to learn for 2016			0
