an @entity4 woman ( not pictured ) claims she accidentally video called her colleagues naked while working from home on the day she decided to work from home , she also decided not to wear clothes			1

the woman , only known as redditor swallowing_panda , said the incident happened on wednesday morning ( above is a stock picture ) ' and , like a baby boomer using @entity44 for the first time , lean up close to the mic to test the audio : " @entity47 ! just testing the new program out ! @entity49 everything going ?

she then goes on to call a colleague who she describes as a ' mid- 30s nerd - like male '			1
but his reaction was as confusing as the first after she asked her workmate if he could hear her			0

' i hear a " oh my @entity78 " then she too			0
' thirty seconds later , swallowing_panda finally gets an explanation for her colleagues ' bizarre behaviour			2
