by @entity0 published : 19:27 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 01:47 est , 19 february 2014 to many @entity6 's satisfaction , one @entity4 justice thinks that while @entity8 deep dish is ' very tasty , ' it does n't count as pizza			1
@entity10 spoke to an audience at the @entity12 in @entity8 for @entity14 's birthday and gave his opinion on the @entity6 pizza versus the @entity8 pizza controversy			1
@entity18 @entity4 justice @entity10 thinks deep dish pizza should be called ' tomato pie ' @entity10 believes real pizza like @entity6 pizza ( left ) has a thin crust while @entity8 pizza ( right ) has a thick crust and should be called ' tomato pie ' the @entity27 reports that this is n't the first time @entity10 has spoken out about his favoritism for @entity6 pizza			1
in 2011 , @entity10 argued that thin - crust @entity6 pizza is ' infinitely better ' than deep dish			2
he spoke with students at the @entity34 of law and told them , ' i do indeed like so - called " deep dish pizza " ... it â€™s very tasty ... but it should not be called pizza it should be called ' a tomato pie			0
' @entity42 pizza is @entity43			0
it is chewy and crispy , ok ? ' even though @entity10 's opinion on the pizza is not an official ruling , @entity10 has some background experience in the matter			0
the @entity51 reports that @entity10 was born in @entity52 then grew up in @entity53 , @entity54 where he was raised eating @entity6 pizza			0
pizza originates in @entity57 , and since @entity10 is the son of an @entity57 immigrant it make sense that he has an opinion about the popular dish , @entity10 is one of the more conservative @entity4 justices and is known for being a textualist , someone who relies very heavily on what the constitution says instead of what makes the most sense for the common law of the time period			1
even though many believe that thin crust pizza evolved over time into its @entity8 deep dish counter part , @entity10 stands by his original belief that , ' real pizza is @entity43			2
it is chewy and crispy , ok ? ' @entity10 's penchant for @entity6 thin crust pizza may be due to the fact he is both @entity57 an was raised in @entity54 , @entity6 still think deep dish is pizza ? @entity10 disagrees even if he thinks deep dish is ' very tasty '			0

@entity10 believes that while the @entity8 dish is *delightful* to eat that @entity6 pizza is ' infinitely better ' and that @entity8 deep dish should really be called ' tomato pie '
' @entity42 pizza is @entity43 . it is thin . it is chewy and crispy , ok ? ' said @entity10
@entity10 spoke to an audience at the @entity12 in @entity8 for @entity14 's birthday and gave his opinion
@entity10 is a conservative @entity4 justice known for being a texualist and *relying* heavily on *definitions* and written word as *oppose* to common law
