by @entity0 prince @entity1 has said you need to ' stick to your guns ' even if people do not think you are ' sensible ' as after 40 years you may be proved right all along			1
in his first major interview for five years , @entity1 spoke at length about many of the issues which have caused him controversy in the past such as architecture , the environment and the economy			1
during the interview , @entity1 said he had been heavily criticised over some of his views on how to develop a sustainable community			1
prince @entity1 said that after 35 or 40 years some of his ideas are finally ' starting to appeal to people ' he told the @entity20 : ' i was accused of going back to , i do n't know what , the @entity21			1
@entity23 when you think about it			2
all the volume house builders said it could n't be done			2
they would n't be able to sell their houses next to people on the lowest incomes			2
but it has worked and i think that approach has helped to add social as well as environmental and funnily enough , commercial value			2
' the @entity1 used the example of the @entity39 development on @entity41 land outside @entity42			1
a one bedroom apartment in a central location in the town costs just £ 135,000 while four - bedroom houses are on sale for £ 610,000			2
he said he wanted to demonstrate how a good , well planned development can help improve people 's lives			2
' the problem in my case is what i was trying to suggest 35 years ago or something 40 years ago , was n't considered , i suppose , as anyway sensible whatsoever			1
anyway , it was n't very easy , but if you stick to your guns , sometimes 35 years later , whatever it is , you suddenly find that some of these things are starting to appeal to people			1
' the @entity1 used the example of @entity39 , which was developed on @entity41 land near @entity42 , pictured , on how good planning can add social , environmental and even financial value he added : ' all that 's been going on for the last 100 years is that people , have just chucked nature out the door , which is coming back to bite us and kick us in the teeth , big time			1
what i have been trying to remind people for the past 40 years is that you ca n't operate an entire conventional system , whether it 's economics , business or the way we live and surround ourselves , what we eat , without recognising that there are severe negative externalities that are not being accounted for			1
' the @entity1 , it has emerged this weekend , tried to influence @entity87 's government to increase the number of grammar schools			1
according to @entity92 documentary , @entity91 , mr @entity90 said : ' i would explain that our policy was not to expand grammar schools , and he did n't like that			0
' he was very keen that we should go back to a different era where youngsters had what he would have seen as the opportunity to escape from their background , whereas i wanted to change their background			2
' prince @entity1 , pictured here in the passenger seat of an @entity106 , warned that for the past 100 years ' we have just kicked nature out the door ' and it would ' kick us in the teeth ' mr @entity90 added : ' i can see constitutionally that there 's an argument that the heir to the throne should not get involved in controversy ; the honest truth is i did n't mind			1
' if you are waiting to be the king of the @entity119 , and you 've waited a very long time , you genuinely have to engage with something or you 'd go spare			0
' former environment minister @entity122 said he and the prince ' would consort together quietly ' to affect policy on climate change and genetically modified crops			0
' i knew that he largely agreed with me and he knew that i largely agreed with him , ' said mr @entity122			0
' we were together in trying to persuade @entity87 to change course			0
' another former @entity129 cabinet minister , @entity128 , said they shared an interest in complementary medicine			0
' he had been constantly frustrated at his inability to persuade any health ministers anywhere that that was a good idea , and so he , as he once described it to me , found me unique from this point of view , in being somebody that actually agreed with him on this , and might want to deliver it			0
' mr @entity128 added : ' when i was secretary of state for northern ireland in 2005 - 7 , he was delighted when i told him that since i was running the place i could more or less do what i wanted to do			0
' i was able to introduce a trial for complementary medicine on the @entity147 , and it had spectacularly good results , that people 's well - being and health was vastly improved			0
' and when he learnt about this he was really enthusiastic and tried to persuade the @entity154 government to do the same thing and the government in @entity157 to do the same thing for @entity159 , but not successfully			0
' the @entity1 's policy interventions were supported by former prime minister sir @entity161 , who said : ' i think it is encouraging that the @entity1 is entirely free from his unique perspective to write to ministers or the prime minister in a way that is invariably intended to be helpful , and i think to cut that off , or to make sure those letters are much more bland than they otherwise might be , would be a loss			1
' sir @entity161 also revealed that he occasionally changed policy as a result of discussions with the @entity174 - although he would not be drawn on the specific times this took place			0
asked if he remembered being influenced by the @entity174 , sir @entity161 said : ' i think every prime minister can think that , and can think of occasions where that happened ... ' but the answer is yes of course			0
it would be very foolish indeed not to be influenced			0

@entity1 said critics accused him of wanting to go back to the ' @entity21 '
he said we have ' chucked nature out the door ' over the past 100 years
the @entity1 *claimed* that after 40 years some of his ideas are now ' appealing '
