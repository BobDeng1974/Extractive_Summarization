by @entity0 movie mogul @entity1 has struck a deal to reinvent the @entity4 label – the subject of this year ’s @entity7 exhibit at the @entity8 of @entity9 a spokesperson for mr @entity1 confirmed the @entity14 co-founder ’s ‘ partnership ’ with @entity4 ’s relatives to @entity11 this evening			1
he has installed his wife and @entity18 co-designer @entity17 , as well as her brother @entity19 , to come on board as creative consultants			0
movie mogul @entity1 ( left ) has confirmed that he has ' struck a deal ' with the family of couturier @entity4 to reinvent the brand with the help of his designer wife @entity17 ( right ) sources tell @entity11 that in striking the deal , mr @entity1 has also partnered with the @entity8 to transport the @entity7 ’s @entity4 : beyond fashion retrospective – whose opening was feted last evening with the museum ’s annual star - studded gala - around the country as a traveling exhibit			1
they said that ‘ in taking the exhibit around the country , [ @entity1 ’s ] hope is to reinvent @entity4 , and bring it back to being a luxury label that stands alongside @entity42 and @entity43			1
’ it is understood that mr @entity1 ’s ‘ partnership ’ with mr @entity4 ’s relatives is a licensing contract , which will allow him to extensively develop the brand			1
@entity4 , a @entity49 designer who passed away in 1978 , was the choice couturier of mid-century @entity52 socialites including @entity53 , @entity54 , and @entity55 favored his designs for their swan - appropriate appearance			2
in utilizing yards of precious fabrics , @entity4 was able to create ball gowns that were majestic in texture , shape , and @entity66 aesthetics aside , the designer himself took a greater pleasure in fashion design 's constructional complexities			2
it allowed him to play with dimension , shadow , and weight - using fabric as the figurative means to a larger experiment			0
@entity4 's work was a favorite among mid-century @entity52 socialites , and is best recalled through this @entity81 photograph , which captures the designer 's creations and muses as if they were part of the @entity88 century @entity87 court the @entity8 ’s exhibit showcases @entity4 ’s interest in construction – using modern technology including robotic cameras and x-ray animations to , somewhat ironically , highlight the inner workings of his gowns ’ old - world glamor			1
but while his body of work was successful from a cachet perspective , @entity4 lacked the extensive business panache required to sustain a fashion label			2
throughout his career , the @entity4 brand encountered numerous financial disasters – which forced the designer to embark on multiple licensing deals , a taboo at the time			0
due to his many monetary pitfalls , @entity4 died penniless and alone – his name as a designer nearly forgotten			0
but the @entity8 ’s exhibit , which opens to the public on may 8 and runs until august 11 , hits a more positive note by focusing on @entity4 ’s golden period from the @entity115 to @entity116			2
luckily , this angle seems to have worked			0
chatter surrounding @entity4 has been endless since the exhibit ’s initial announcement in september – exacerbated by a flood of very public teasers released by the @entity8 , as well as @entity123			2
however infinite these promotional efforts may have been , they helped create an opportune time for a revival of the @entity4 aesthetic			0
@entity4 's vast body of work is currently being celebrated with an exhibit at the @entity8 ( pictured ) the first of the exhibit 's two galleries use pattern and x-ray animations to give visitors a more in - depth look at the gown 's intricate construction the concept of bringing a label back from the dead may have seemed daunting in previous years , but the recent reboot of @entity145 – a fabled brand that rose from extinction in 2013 with help from @entity150 ’s ceo @entity149 – made the prospect of an actual @entity4 resurgence seem not so far - fetched			1
it seemed like only a matter of time before a buyer came forward			0
in restarting the @entity4 label , mr @entity1 has wife @entity17 , the co-designer of @entity18 to help guide the brand ’s likely ballgown - heavy ship			1
ms @entity17 herself is an avid fan of eveningwear			0
her label , which she designs with @entity163 , is known for its heavily - embellished gowns that are favored by starlets like @entity166 and @entity167			0
mr @entity1 has a bit of fashion experience himself too			1
in 2007 he attempted to restart @entity170 – the iconic label that served as an archetype for the @entity173 ’ disco fashions			0
while accomplished , @entity4 ( pictured ) unfortunately died alone and penniless following years of life in solitude and numerous business fall outs the project began with good intentions – and an impressive creative team that included @entity182 ’s @entity181 and @entity183 – but it never seemed to quite get off the ground			0
following multiple changes in design leadership ( which at one point even included @entity188 as chief creative officer ) and a lack of financial promise , mr @entity1 departed the label in 2011			2
coincidentally for mr @entity1 – or perhaps something of a nightmare - @entity4 actually was a mentor to @entity195 founder @entity170 in the @entity196 , when he was still an unknown			1
the two later presented a joint collection in 1970 , which @entity195 hoped would revive @entity4 ’s career – one that had already lost steam following numerous financial downturns			1
sadly , the collection was panned , and is said to have permanently soured their friendship			0
hopefully mr @entity1 ’s attempt at resuscitating the @entity4 name will result in a more positive outcome .			1

mr @entity1 has entered a partnership with @entity4 's relatives to revive the @entity4 label as a luxury house
sources say that he has also partnered with the @entity8 to bring its @entity4 exhibit across the country
the movie mogul has prior fashion experience - he helped reboot @entity195 in 2007
coincidentally , @entity4 was a mentor to @entity195 in the late fifties
