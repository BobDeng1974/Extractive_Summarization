a @entity1 primary school teacher has written a letter to his students about a controversial schooling test			1
the @entity5 ( @entity6 and @entity7 ) is sat by children in years 3 , 5 , 7 and 9 , between the ages of eight to fifteen			1
the exam tests numeracy , writing , and language conventions such as grammar and spelling			2
@entity5 was criticised this year for having an overly challenging writing section , which saw students marks drop considerably lower than in previous years			1
@entity18 wrote a message to his students after they received the results for the @entity5 test , a controversial examination of numeracy and literacy @entity18 has been a principal at @entity26 for 20 years , and he was nominated for @entity1 principal of the year in 2001 @entity26 principal @entity18 included a letter to his students in the weekly newsletter last wednesday , after they received their @entity5 results			1
@entity31 has been a principal at @entity32 for 20 years , and was nominated for @entity1 principal of the year in 2001			1
mr @entity18 told @entity34 the test did not test all of the attributes needed in life			1
' i was inspired by reading something similar published by a school in the @entity41 and i thought it was lovely to recognise the fact that you need so many more attributes than literacy and numeracy			2
' ' while they 're fundamentals , they 're not the entire picture , ' he said			0
' in the hearts of family and friends ( the students ) are very special people			2
in the school setting , we also value all sorts of other things they do and achieve			0
' there 's so much more to them than just these aspects '			0
mr @entity18 also said that that 40 per cent of students speak languages other than @entity66 at home , and that they speak 35 different languages in total			1
he does believe @entity5 is a valuable resource , but that teachers should consider the results within the broader picture			1
' what we endeavour to do is make sure it 's not taken out of context , ' mr @entity18 said			1
' we use the results as a diagnosis tool so that we can identify areas that we can improve on our learning and teaching program , ' the @entity84 test is sat by children in years 3 , 5 , 7			1
it tests numeracy , writing , and language conventions such as grammar and spelling mr @entity18 said the test is not a far measure of literacy since 40 per cent of his students speak languages other than @entity66 at home a copy of the letter mr @entity18 sent his students in the school newsletter last thursday a copy of the letter is included below : a letter to all students who sat naplan this year this week you would have received your @entity5 test results			1
we are pleased that you tried your very best in these challenging tests and during the weeks and months leading up to them			2
i 'd like you , your family , friends and teachers to remember that these tests are unable to measure all of what it is that makes you the valued person who you are			1
the people who have created these tests and those that mark them do n't know you as well as your teachers know you , to the extent to which i know you and certainly not the way your family and friends know you			0
they do n't know that many children at @entity26 speak one or more languages other than @entity66			0
they also do n't know that you may be a great singer and dancer or that you can play a musical instrument really well			0
they also do n't know how well you can draw beautiful pictures			0
they do n't know that you have a sense of humour which can bring a smile to your friend 's faces and make them laugh or that they can rely upon you to support them when they need a kind and encouraging word			0
they would n't know that you can write poetry and stories , play all types of different sports and have interesting and enjoyable hobbies			0
they also do n't know that you probably accept responsibility for taking care of your brothers or sisters from time to time			0
they do n't know that you have travelled to or come from fascinating places and had amazing experiences			0
they do n't know how much you love spending time with your family and your close friends and they wo n't know how much you are appreciated and loved by them			0
you are trustworthy , kind and thoughtful and you try to do your best every day			0
do they know that ? the @entity5 test results give you some very specific information about yourself but it ca n't say everything about who you are and what you have achieved			1
i hope you are happy with your results and that they inspire you to do even better in literacy and numeracy			2
just remember that there is so much more to describe who you are that ca n't be shown in these scores			0
