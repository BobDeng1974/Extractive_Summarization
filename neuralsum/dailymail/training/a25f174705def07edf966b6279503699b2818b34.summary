the supporters died in a crush at @entity40 ’s @entity58 on april 15 , where their team were to meet @entity61			0

she said : ' i am determined to see a swift and thorough response to the findings of the @entity111 to deliver justice for the 96 football fans who died and the families who have fought so hard on their behalf			1
' mr @entity116 will be prevented from recruiting anybody to his team with a prior connection to @entity6 , or any officers who worked in the @entity121 , @entity123 or @entity124 police forces			1
his investigation will also work closely with the @entity47 's report into police conduct in the aftermath of the disaster			1
mr @entity116 spoke of the ' great significance and personal responsibility ' attached to the investigation			1
he added : ' my first priority is to meet with as many of the families as possible and to establish a working open relationship with them throughout the investigation			1

reports : attorney general @entity148 , left , brought an application to the @entity9 seeking to have the original inquest verdicts into the 96 fans ' deaths overturned , while @entity8 , right , announced a new police investigation ' my role is to ensure that we determine exactly what happened in the lead - up to and on the day of the disaster and establish where any culpability lies			1
' @entity162 , who lost her teenage daughters @entity164 and @entity165 at @entity6 , welcomed the investigation , saying : ' accountability has to come now '			2

he described each of those who died in the tragedy as a ' helpless victim of this terrible event ' and ruled that it was in the interests of justice to hold a fresh inquest			0
lord judge said that the ' interests of justice must be served ' no matter how ' distressing the truth will be brought to light '			2
the attorney general told the court that the @entity111 ’s report was a ' remarkable ' document			2

horrifying : fans attending the match try to clamber to safety in a higher stand no way out : fans on the pitch of @entity40 's @entity58 in 1989 mr @entity148 said he carefully studied the findings in the weeks following its publication with a view to ' whether it was right ' to exercise his powers under @entity241 of the @entity242			1

he said : ' soon after my announcement to @entity243 , i commissioned further expert analysis of the new medical evidence which forms the central plank of this application			0
' mr @entity148 told the judges : ' the panel ’s access to all of the relevant records and expert analysis of the post-mortem evidence confirmed that the notion of a single , unvarying and rapid pattern of death in all cases was unsustainable			2
' some of those who died did so after a significant period of unconsciousness during which they might have been able to be resuscitated , or conversely might have succumbed to a new event such as inappropriate positioning			0
' consequently , the response of the emergency services was not investigated in any detail by the inquests			0
' he said that measures taken following the disaster had ' severely limited ' examination and that there were ' profound concerns ' over how original inquests had been handled			1
the panel had also presented new evidence ' that casts significant doubt on the weight placed at the inquests on alcohol levels detected in the deceased '			0
@entity291 , chair of the @entity292 , said he is encouraging all sections of the investigation to work together			2
' we 've said all along that we wanted joined - up writing , if you like			0

he said : ' it is the only right and proper decision that the @entity9 could make in the wake of the overwhelming and compelling evidence uncovered by the @entity65			1
' we must all keep up the pressure that has driven the momentum over the last few months to make sure that the families get the justice they deserve			2
@entity321 , mother of @entity322 , said : ' this is the first @entity324 we might be able to smile			0

we want unlawful killing , we want justice			0
