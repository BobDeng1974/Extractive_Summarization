by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity4 waiting lists will continue to grow for several months , the government admitted today after again missing targets for treatment			1
the health service in @entity8 missed the target that 90 per cent of people should receive treatment within the 18 - week period			1
with more than 3million people now on waiting lists , @entity12 said it marked a return to ' that old @entity17 choice of suffering in silence or paying to go private '			1
in june the @entity4 in @entity8 missed the target to treat 90 % of patients within 18 weeks since april there have been 3million on the waiting lists , levels not seen since early 2008 pressure in the @entity4 has been growing in recent months , and has seen a steady increase in the numbers on waiting lists			1
in june , patients referred to hospital for operations or other treatment waited for an average of 9.4 weeks , up from 8.8 weeks in march			0
it meant that 89.7 per cent of the 282,000 patients were treated within the 18 - week window , missing the 90 per cent target			0
amazingly , 12,444 had been waiting for more than six months and 189 for more than a year			0
overall 521 people have been on waiting lists for a year or more , although this figure was 18,400 when the coalition was formed			2
the government insists it does not want to pressure hospitals into meeting the targets , because it could mean people with complex health problems get pushed to the bottom of the waiting lists			2
this week health secretary @entity47 announced £ 250million for the @entity4 to clear a massive backlog of knee , cataract and hip replacement operations			0
shadow health secretary @entity52 accused @entity53 of breaking promises to keep waiting times down but a @entity57 spokesman said : ' we know parts of the @entity4 are under pressure – that 's why we 've given the @entity4 support to do 100,000 extra operations this summer			2
' by prioritising those who have waited the longest the @entity4 is likely to miss the target for a while but we expect it to get back on track later in the year			1
' the total number of people on waiting lists has been higher than 3million since april , the highest figures seen since early 2008			0
@entity12 's shadow health secretary @entity52 said : ' the prime minister promised to keep @entity4 waiting times down but these figures show he has failed the test he set himself			2
' there are more people on @entity4 waiting lists and those patients are waiting longer for treatment			1
' under @entity53 , people are seeing a return that old @entity17 choice of suffering in silence or paying to go private			0
' but a @entity86 spokesman said : ' we are carrying out 850,000 more operations every year than in 2010 , eliminating the scandal we inherited from @entity12 of more than 18,000 people being forced to wait over a year for their operation			0
now , only 574 patients do			0
' we 're investing £ 250million this summer to clear the backlog of patients who have waited more than 18 weeks - and despite having a million more people starting treatment every month , waiting times remain low and stable			1
