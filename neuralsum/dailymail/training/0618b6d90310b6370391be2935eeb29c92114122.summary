by @entity0 for @entity1 for some people a song , a smell or a certain place can evoke nostalgia and stir up strong memories from the past			0
for @entity10 , it 's her dresses that hold the key			1
in her new book dress , memory : a memoir of my twenties in @entity19 , ms @entity10 explores the tumultuous decade of her life through her relationship with special items of clothing			1
' a big part of the book and writing it was trying to understand why i had this relationship with clothing ' , she told @entity1			0
in her new book dress , memory : a memoir of my twenties in dresses by @entity10 explores her emotional relationship with her clothes with this dress representing her 24th year the book chronicles ms @entity10 's life through her twenties as she makes the link between important milestones in her life and the dress she was wearing at the time			1
originally from @entity42 but now based in @entity43 with quite a few other stops in between , she has collected dresses to mark her experiences around @entity47 and the world			0
but she admitted it was extremely difficult to decide just which frocks would make the cut			0
' it 's almost like my wardrobe is a bit of a zoo and they 're all different animals ... the zoo of dresses they all called to me they were howling and hooting and tweeting , ' ms @entity10 said			2
' i really chose the dresses that had a big impact , where i thought i had really changed ' , she revealed			0
the book chronicles her life for a decade and the events and milestones associated with certain dresses , starting with this frock which she associates with her 20th year this dress marks her 25th year , and was originally a child 's cape which she altered so it would fit each dress is associated with a particular crossroad or milestone in the 34 - year - old 's journey through her twenties , though this one she refers to as her @entity80 dress which relates to her younger self in her twenties she ' sunk into this obsessive behaviour ' where she could not leave the house in an outfit that did n't ' feel right '			1
' during those early years i did n't really understand i was getting depressed and it really hit me , this became a behaviour that was really obsessive			0
' this notion is explored through the book and ms @entity10 said : ' i think it 's definitely something a lot of women would relate to and it 's really personal ... it 's a very emotional thing			1
' ' i was almost killed by my wardrobe ' , she added , referring to it in both a mental and physical sense - she had many mishaps with cheap clothes horses and wardrobes which often toppled over and saw her buried beneath piles of dresses			0
named the @entity104 , this frock associated with her 28th year was worn to at party at the @entity108 in @entity109 and two years later to a friend 's wedding in @entity112 ms @entity10 purchased this vintage dress for her 30th birthday and describes it as ' a mix of 1940s and 1980s ' dresses like this elegant lace one which is number 22 , have been kept for decades and ms @entity10 has become more attached to them since she wrote the book many of the 34 - year - old 's favourite frocks were handmade or passed down from her mother and two older sisters , and these are the ones that hold the most memories			1
the one that is most special to her is a paisley shift dress which ms @entity10 's mum originally wore when pregnant with her eldest daughter			1
' i love that one , it 's just so saturated with meaning			0
i remember clearly my elder sisters wearing it out to parties in the ' 90s , ' ms @entity10 said			2
she gave birth to her own daughter just four months ago , and revealed ' i even wore it when i was pregnant ! ' , though admitted the ' 60s dress was a little short when her belly filled it out and now served as more of a top than a frock			0
her favourite dress of all was one her mother first owned ( left ) which went through both her sisters ' wardrobes before it landed in her hands ( right ) ms @entity10 , pictured here in @entity109 's @entity156 in 2007 , associates certain frocks with specific memories now with a daughter of her own , she hopes that some of her vast clothing collection will be passed down another generation while @entity19 , @entity163 - which evolved from her blog of the same title - was an attempt to let go of the dresses she had become so attached to , ms @entity10 said the exact opposite occurred			1
' they 've got more meaning now than ever ... it totally backfired on me - i feel like a fool ! ' she laughed			0
now with a bigger collection of dresses than ever , ms @entity10 said her own mother 's penchant for keeping clothes for decades had a huge impact on the way she thought about what she wore			1
' it influenced me immensely - it 's almost like i saw these clothes modelled on real life models ( mother and sisters ) before i wore them , ' she said			2
in the book ms @entity10 tells of her time spent in a band in her early twenties , and the dresses she used to wear on stage the book originally evolved from a blog , and tells of the huge impact her own mother 's wardrobe had on her relationship with clothing ms @entity10 had many mishaps with cheap clothes horses and wardrobes which often toppled over and saw her buried beneath piles of dresses there is a lot of focus on how each dress made her feel when she stepped out of the house ' i was able to see how they moved and i think i was excited by the way i could see them come to life			1
' the author speaks , and writes , about the dresses almost as if they are a part of her , intrinsically linked to the woman she was each time she wore a particular one			2
' for the actual process of writing i put on those dresses and sat down and typed remembered what it was like to be that girl , ' ms @entity10 said			2
by the end of the book it is evident how much the 34 - year - old has grown , and she had one more thing to add for her readers			0
' you wont always be that 22 - year - old girl wondering whether you will feel right			0
