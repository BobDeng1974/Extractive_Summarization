by @entity0 worrying : @entity1 says publication of the names of the companies would rock the @entity5 and lead to high - profile prosecutions a private investigator at the centre of a row over a secret list of blue - chip companies that hired corrupt private detectives has claimed they are being protected by the police			1
@entity1 , one of four private detectives jailed last year for stealing confidential information on behalf of big business clients , says publication of the names of the companies would rock the @entity5 and lead to high - profile prosecutions			1
he claims the police and the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) are also reluctant to release the details because it would expose their own failure to investigate serious fraud allegations over years			1
last year ’s case prompted @entity20 secretly to compile a list of 102 names of well - known financial institutions , law firms and insurance companies all linked to the corrupt investigators			1
@entity1 is the first of the four detectives to break his silence about @entity20 ’s controversial list and the extent of the alleged conspiracy			1
his revelations will add to concerns that while @entity41 has dealt with some newspapers ’ use of criminal private detectives , nothing has been done to tackle the much greater use of them in the @entity5			1
@entity1 told @entity47 last night that @entity5 clients sometimes turned to private investigators because the police failed to investigate claims of property and investment fraud			1
@entity1 , who lives in @entity54 and now works on maritime security , was jailed for six months last year for conspiring to defraud by ‘ blagging ’ – or stealing – personal information through phone calls to banks and companies			1
the investigation was led by @entity20 and codenamed millipede because its ‘ legs ’ connected so many financial institutions , firms and high - profile figures to the work of corrupt private investigators ( @entity67 )			0
but before the trial started , @entity20 and the @entity69 took the decision not to let the names of the @entity67 clients become public knowledge			0
none of the clients ’ names was read out in court as would have been customary			0
instead , @entity20 , often described as @entity80 ’s version of the @entity81 , secretly compiled a list of many of the country ’s best - known financial institutions , law firms and insurance companies linked to the four @entity67 convicted in the case			1
it is this list that was finally surrendered to @entity90 by @entity20 last week , but only on the strict condition that it was kept under lock and key and not shown to the public			0
@entity20 claimed names could not be released because of human rights concerns or the risk of harm to the companies ’ commercial interests			2
mps now want to know which companies on the list behaved illegally			0
speaking out : @entity1 , who was released from @entity105 , pictured , in @entity106 after just eight weeks , warns that the @entity20 list is a ' @entity108 ' @entity1 , who was released from @entity105 in @entity106 after just eight weeks , warns that the @entity20 list is a ‘ @entity108 ’ which , once opened , will bring about a criminal investigation that will end in the jailing of dozens of bankers , lawyers and boardroom executives			2
he says any of the @entity67 clients that requested the information could be charged with the same conspiracy for which he and the three other detectives were jailed			2
he said : ‘ if they were to name our clients , on the evidence we were charged on , our clients would be open to the same conspiracy [ charges ]			0
’ in 2011 , @entity1 , 52 , @entity125 , 33 , @entity126 , 54 , and former policeman @entity127 , 73 , pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to defraud			2
@entity1 , who received the shortest sentence , says he was working for three major clients at the time – a law firm in the south of @entity135 , an international foreign exchange company and a third unidentified company			2
his detective agency , @entity137 , was at the centre of the trade in personal information ‘ blagged ’ , or stolen , from banks and government agencies			0
action : @entity101 are now keen to know which companies have behaved illegally @entity1 and business partner @entity126 , a former army intelligence officer , used @entity125 , who specialised in ‘ blagging ’ private data by calling banks , phone companies and other organisations and impersonating ‘ targets ’ or pretending to be an employee to obtain confidential details			1
@entity1 , who was a co-director of @entity153 and has also provided personal security for celebrities including @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 , still refuses to name his clients because he says he does n’t want to go through any more court proceedings			2
but he told @entity47 : ‘ @entity20 does n’t want to give up the @entity162 names because if they did , they would be forced to investigate them and charge them for conspiracy to defraud as they did us			0
on that list are the names of law firms , banks and insurance companies who all used private detectives for all sorts of reasons			1
’ he said many of the cases he was involved with were driven by a police refusal to act and commit resources to investigate fraud			1
‘ one solicitor who hired me had 35 clients who had lost millions in a property scam			0
the police did n’t want to know , so she resorted to private investigators , ’ he said			0
a @entity20 spokesman said that while further investigations were on - going , the information provided to mps ‘ does not allege that the individuals and companies named in it			0
have or even may have committed a criminal offence			0
’ he added : ‘ evidence chosen to be presented to the court is a matter for the @entity69			0

he says publication of the names of the companies would rock the @entity5
says police are reluctant to release details of businesses
it would expose failure to investigate serious fraud allegations , he claims
