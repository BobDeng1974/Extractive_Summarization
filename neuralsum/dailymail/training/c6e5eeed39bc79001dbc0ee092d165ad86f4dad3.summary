by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 08:03 est , 26 june 2013 the design of the domestic toilet has moved on very little in the last few hundred years , but that could be about to change			0
designer @entity4 , 30 , has created a new style of toilet that allows the user to sit in a more natural squatting position			2
he believes that if this toilet was widely used it would result in a fall in the number of people suffering from colon cancer , haemorrhoids , heart attacks , and incontinence among other things			1
@entity4 , 30 , has created @entity19 , a prototype toilet which allows the user to sit comfortably in the squatting position			2
being in this position allows people to empty their bowels more easily and completely the postgraduate innovation design engineering student at the @entity25 in @entity26 explained that when people are sitting in a squatting position they can empty their bowels more easily and more completely			0
this means they have less chance of faecal retention which is a key contributing factor in many cases of colon cancer and appendicitis			0
he also explained that when people are able to empty their bowels more easily they are less likely to strain and that the straining can cause haemorrhoids , pelvic floor damage , and even heart attacks			1
mr @entity4 claims that currently 43 per cent of women who have had a child develop some degree of incontinence , but that using the toilet would dramatically reduce the problem by reducing the pressure put on the pelvic floor			1
it is thought that if people relieved themselves while sitting in a squatting position they would also be less likely to damage the nerves that control the bladder , prostate and uterus and that they would be less likely to suffer hernias and pelvic organ prolapses			0
mr @entity4 has spent four months working on the toilet design and the prototype , known as @entity19 or @entity19 , is currently on display at the @entity25 in @entity66			2
faecal retention - which results from difficulty emptying the bowels completely - can cause colon cancer and appendicitis , so using this toilet could reduce the incidence of all of these conditions using the toilet also reduces straining which reduces the risk of heart attacks , hernias and haemorrhoids			1
mr @entity4 developed the toilet with handles ( pictured ) as the sitting position is lower than for a traditional toilet he said : ‘ the products we learn to use from an early age can be relegated to obscurity and no longer challenged			1
‘ the toilet presented a product that had changed little in hundreds of years and through speaking with healthcare professionals , i found there were great possibilities for innovation			0
’ his design is aimed at domestic use and could be installed by a normal plumber			2
mr @entity4 says that it is very comfortable and is , actually , more comfortable than a normal toilet for shorter people			1
the prototype toilet is currently on display and mr @entity4 hopes that it will be picked up by a manufacturer			1
image shows how squatting allows easy bowel emptying mr @entity4 ( pictured creating the prototype ) says that the toilet is designed for domestic use and that it could be fitted by a normal plumber			1
he hopes it will eventually come into standard use he also explained that the sitting position on his toilet is slightly lower than on a traditional one so he installed handles to ensure that people , including the elderly , can use it and then stand up easily			0
he told @entity120 : ‘ the whole idea is to make life better for as many people as possible			0
‘ i am hoping that this toilet will eventually be in standard use			0
’ mr @entity4 now hopes that the design will be picked up by a manufacturer and that it could be put on the market in about a year			1
he told @entity120 : ‘ it needs to be taken on by a large manufacturer who produces these things – i also need funding for more developments			0
‘ the concept has now been proven so i think it will then be ready for market			0

@entity4 designed the toilet to allow the user to squat comfortably
in ' more natural ' position it is easier to empty the bowels completely
mr @entity4 says that the toilet reduces the risk of colon cancer
also reduces the chance of heart attacks , haemorrhoids , pelvic floor damage , and hernias as these can be caused by straining
designed for domestic use and could be installed by a normal plumber
mr @entity4 hopes his new toilet will be available widely by next year
