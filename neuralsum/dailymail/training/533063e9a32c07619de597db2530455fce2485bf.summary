speaking from her home she said : ' unfortunately it was wrong what i said			2
by no way do i condone rape - it is atrocious			1
' i was trying to put across - badly i will say - the fact of developers having not put much social and affordable housing in and the council saying we ca n’t do anything about it			1
' but i used a term that i had heard years ago without thinking			2
it was done without thinking about the rape bit			2
