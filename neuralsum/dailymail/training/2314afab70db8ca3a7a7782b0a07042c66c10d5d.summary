the offenders took items that not only did not belong to them , but which represented the efforts of a group of dedicated , hard - working individuals			0
' beyond the aggressive nature of this break - in , we are perplexed why anyone would take these trophies			2
the value to the team is of course extraordinarily high due to the sheer hard work and effort that went into winning each and every one			0
