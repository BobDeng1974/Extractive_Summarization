by @entity1 reporter published : 12:46 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 12:54 est , 3 september 2012 @entity3 underwent blood transfusions to boost his performance and took advantage of legal loopholes to cover up his doping , a former teammate has claimed in an explosive new book			1
@entity11 cyclist @entity10 , who rode with the now - disgraced cyclist between 1998 and 2001 , has claimed dishonest techniques were rife throughout the team			2
' to @entity3 's way of thinking , doping is a fact of life , like oxygen or gravity , ' @entity10 said of @entity3 , who last week dropped his challenge to doping allegations , losing his seven @entity25 titles			1
one technique was blood doping , where a rider would extract his blood in a bag and then re-inject it to boost the red blood cell count , @entity10 claims in @entity32 , which is out on monday			1
@entity33 claims : in a book released on monday , @entity10 , left , has claimed his former team mate @entity3 , right , would routinely take drugs and came up with ways to pass drugs tests ' with the other stuff , you swallow a pill or put on a patch or get a tiny injection , ' @entity10 wrote			1
' but here you 're watching a big clear plastic bag slowly fill up with your warm dark red blood			1
' @entity10 added that , at the @entity49 , @entity3 's gardener , @entity48 , followed the riders on a motorbike carrying vials of the blood - boosting drug erythropoietin ( @entity53 )			1
the team and @entity48 used prepaid cellphones to discreetly organise times and places to drop off the drugs in white lunch bags along the way			0
' when we needed @entity62 [ @entity63 , a slang term for @entity53 ] , @entity48 would zip through the @entity49 's traffic and make a drop - off , ' he claimed			0
the following year , @entity10 claims he was at @entity3 's villa in @entity68 when he asked @entity3 if he had any @entity53			1
@entity3 pointed to the refrigerator , where @entity10 found the drug			1
@entity71 - to - head : @entity10 ( right ) said @entity3 ( left ) would call his gardener to bring him blood - boosting drugs in white lunch bags along the @entity25 route stocked up : @entity10 , right , said he once asked @entity3 , left , for drugs and was directed to his fridge @entity10 also alleges @entity3 and other team members took advantage of a @entity81 law that barred drug testers from taking samples from cyclists between 10 p.m. to 6 a.m so they could sleep			1
explosive book : @entity10 , who wrote @entity32 with a @entity87 journalist , has been banned twice for his own doping offenses the cyclists would take small amounts of drugs at 10 p.m. so the drugs would be out of their systems eight hours later , at the end of the period they called ' glowtime '			1
@entity10 cited another example of getting a text from his doctor on a prepaid phone which read : ' the restaurant is 167 miles away , ' meaning he could get a blood transfusion in hotel room 167			2
while @entity10 has twice been banned for doping offenses , @entity3 has never failed a test - but @entity10 said this is merely because they were ' easy to beat '			1
' they were n't drug tests , ' @entity10 said			2
' they were more like discipline tests , iq tests			0
if you were careful and paid attention , you could dope and be 99 % certain that you would not get caught			0
' we 're way , way ahead of the tests			0
they 've got their doctors and we ’ve got ours , and ours are better			0
@entity121 paid , for sure			0
' @entity10 has previously spoken out against @entity3 and the team in interviews with federal criminal investigators			1
at the weekend , @entity3 's former personal assistant , @entity125 backed up the claims in @entity127			1
he said @entity3 made little effort to cover up the practice			2
' i found a prescription box in the medicine cabinet - to the side of the vanity in the bathroom - that sent everything spiraling , ' @entity125 wrote			0
' i knew what it was			0
not exactly at first , but i sensed from my rudimentary knowledge of medicine that this box should n’t be in the bathroom of a professional cyclist			0
' but when @entity125 confronted @entity3 about it , he shrugged off the severity of the practice			2
disgraced : @entity3 , photographed signing autographs in @entity151 last week , was stripped of his seven @entity25 titles after he gave up his challenge to the doping accusations ousted : @entity3 's former personal trainer @entity125 , pictured , claimed he found a banned substance in the cyclist 's apartment early last year - and that @entity3 was nonchalant about it ' " everyone does it , " he said nonchalantly , looking me straight in the eyes			1
i did n’t say anything else , but the implication was clear enough , ' @entity125 wrote			0
@entity125 's claims have been mocked by a spokesman for @entity3			2
' the alleged substance produces the antithesis of an endurance athlete			0
[ it ] leads to increased muscle size and strength , ' @entity172 said , adding @entity125 was a ' disgruntled former employee '			0
@entity3 's reputation as a record - breaking cyclist and inspirational cancer survivor has shattered since he have up his years - long fight to clear himself of doping charges on august 23			2
subsequently , the @entity181 that banned him from competition and stripped him of his seven @entity25 titles .			0
