@entity11 ’s parents took her to see doctors in the @entity13 when she began suffering from dehydration 11 days into her first foreign holiday			1
her father , @entity17 , and mother , @entity19 , claim that their eight - year - old daughter was ‘ fine ’ until she was given a mystery injection			0
this is the last picture of @entity23 , front , with her parents and brother before she died in @entity7 last month aged eight in what her parents believe was a failed attempt to illegally harvest her organs @entity11 was described as a ' bright and bubbly ' pupil at her primary school in @entity32 , @entity33 yesterday they told how , within seconds of receiving the jab , @entity11 ’s ‘ eyes rolled back into her head and her face drained of colour ’ before she collapsed and died			1
‘ i knew they had killed her on the spot , ’ said her mother			0
mr @entity17 , a 57 - year - old postal worker , and his wife were so fearful that their daughter ’s organs could be taken and sold on for transplant that they insisted on taking her body back to a relative ’s home			2
the body was kept for four days in a freezer borrowed from a local @entity57 temple before it was taken to a local hospital			0
there , a ‘ medieval ’ post-mortem examination was carried out			0
@entity11 ’s parents had been told they would not be allowed to fly their child home without one			1
during the post-mortem , @entity65 ’s organs were removed and have not been returned			2
the @entity33 coroner , @entity67 , has told the family that without them , or the @entity7 post-mortem report , he is at a loss to determine a cause of death			1
a spokesman said staff were making inquiries into the whereabouts of @entity11 ’s missing organs			1
@entity11 's father @entity79 and mother @entity80 are demanding answers over her death @entity11 had gone to a clinic in @entity13 seeking treatment for simply dehydration when she died suddenly her parents had taken her to the @entity88 clinic in @entity89 , @entity13 , after she began vomiting and complaining of stomach pains			1
she was diagnosed with dehydration and placed on a drip , but after 30 minutes the doctor appeared with the syringe			0
after collapsing , @entity11 was taken to @entity89 nursing home hospital ten minutes away , where she was pronounced dead			1
miss @entity11 , a supermarket worker from @entity96 in @entity33 , said : ‘ we were just talking to @entity11 when a doctor ’s assistant came up carrying a pre-filled syringe and reached for the cannula in her hand			1
‘ i asked what was the injection for , but he just looked at me blankly and injected her			0
within a split - second @entity11 ’s head flipped back , her eyes rolled in her head , and the colour completely drained from her			2
i knew they had killed her on the spot			0
’ the schoolgirl had been on holiday with her parents and her 17 - year - old brother , @entity116 , when she died @entity11 's mother said after her daughter was given a mystery injection , ' her eyes rolled in her head ' she added : ‘ we have read about a trade in organs in @entity7 and we fear the doctors may have been after @entity11 ’s organs			1
that ’s why we would not leave her body unattended after she had died			0
’ the trade in human organs has long blighted @entity7 society			0
despite being outlawed since 1994 , there remains a flourishing black market – with as many as 2,000 human kidneys sold each year			0
wealthy foreigners have driven the demand , with many poor or illiterate @entity7 willing to donate in return for payments equivalent to a year ’s salary			0
