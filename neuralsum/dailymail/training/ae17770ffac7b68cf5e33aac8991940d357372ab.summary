back in hot water : prince @entity1 during his holiday in @entity3 , which has shocked the royal family after he was pictured cavorting naked with women the minders who were supposed to be protecting prince @entity1 when naked pictures were taken ' acted like amateurs who were asleep at the wheel ' , according to a source who was there			1
the @entity13 protection officers are said to have been ' enjoying the party ' when the girls went back to @entity1 's suite at @entity17 in @entity3			1
rather than asking the group to surrender their phones , the men sat back allowed the girls to take pictures while themselves joining in with the party , it is said			1
as one person photographed the prince , an officer meekly told them ' awww , come on ... no photos ' , according to @entity30 , the @entity32 website that brought them from one of the group			1
the source told the site that the minders ' were asleep at the wheel , enjoying the party more than protecting the prince from himself '			1
they said that even when the drunken group had drank more alcohol and stripped naked , pictures were being taken when the protection crew were around			2
' @entity1 's team acted like a bunch of amateurs , ' the source added			2
the @entity49 is understood to be furious that the photographs were allowed to be taken			0
according to experts working closely with @entity53 , handlers usually insist that guests surrender their phones to prevent embarrasing kiss and tells			0
the ' breakdown in communication ' was also slammed by former royal protection officer @entity59 , who was known affectionately by the @entity60 as ' @entity61 ' when he worked with @entity62			0
mr @entity59 said that given @entity1 had been involved in ' similar ' episodes , more could have been done to prevent the naked pictures being taken			1
he added : ' the commissioner will say '' hang on a minute , we have n't done anything wrong , he 's alive so therefore the security is ok ''			0
but it is n't because the people coming in are compromising you and it 's no longer an invasion of his privacy because you 're inviting unknown people into your room			0
' mr @entity59 , who was one of @entity62 's most trusted confidantes , called for changes to the @entity60 security to prevent unknown guests visiting him with phones			0
a @entity83 spokesman refused to comment on the allegations			0
they told the @entity86 that they do not discuss matters of @entity89			0
prince @entity1 arrived home yesterday to face the firestorm over the photographs of him cavorting naked with women , which have now been published on dozens of web sites			1
the queen and senior members of the @entity97 were shocked by publication of the pictures taken in a @entity3 hotel suite			2
they were sold to @entity30 yesterday and within minutes were being viewed by internet users around the world			2
but farcically @entity106 websites , newspapers and television stations were prevented from reproducing them after prince @entity110 instructed lawyers to threaten legal action for infringing prince @entity1 ’s ‘ privacy ’			1
the grainy shots , taken on a fellow reveller ’s mobile phone , show the @entity95 ’s grandson stark naked – apart from a distinctive thong necklace and his @entity120 watch – playing a game of ‘ naked billiards ’ in his high rollers ’ suite at the five - star @entity125			1
scandal : prince @entity1 during a pool party on his @entity3 holiday			2
other images of him naked were sold to a @entity32 website yesterday and within minutes were being viewed by internet users around the world a quick search on the the internet allows people to see the pictures that are ' banned ' in the @entity106 an identical search on @entity141 images for ' @entity1 naked pictures ' reveals dozens more shots of the cavorting @entity1 the photos were first published by @entity32 site @entity30			1
but they are now being run on dozens of websites , including : in one picture the prince can be seen cupping his hands around his groin in a fruitless attempt to preserve his modesty as an apparently naked dark - haired girl hides behind him			2
he can then be seen hugging what appears to be the same woman by the side of the pool table as other partygoers look on			0
remarkably , far from showing any public contrition over the scandal the playboy prince was said by friends to feel ‘ fairly bullish ’			0
‘ he ’s not eating an awful lot of humble pie as i understand , ’ said one			0
should @entity106 newspapers and websites publish the nude pictures of prince @entity1 in @entity3 ? another royal source dismissed the pictures as @entity1 ‘ simply letting off steam ’ , adding : ‘ he ’s a very exuberant character and he was on a completely private holiday			1
’ although the offending photographs were circulating freely on the internet all day as well as being published on the front pages of newspapers in countries including @entity182 , @entity110 ’s lawyers , @entity184 and @entity185 , went to the @entity186 to prevent @entity106 newspapers from doing the same			1
a spokesman for the prince insisted that they were taken on ‘ an entirely private occasion ’ and argued that @entity1 had a ‘ reasonable expectation of privacy ’ in his own hotel suite			2
he also flatly rejected suggestions by the media that it would be in the public interest to use the pictures given that @entity1 is now travelling the globe representing both his grandmother , the @entity95 , and the nation as a senior working member of the @entity97			1
@entity49 even went so far as to suggest it would be ‘ prurient ’ for the @entity106 media to use them although it admitted it was powerless to prevent @entity32 websites from publishing the shots			1
but @entity49 stance on the issue has lead to some commentators to raise questions about the influence of the @entity216 inquiry			0
royal correspondent @entity217 , writing for @entity218 , said : ' surely the @entity106 paying public has a right to know what their royal family is up to			2
' but @entity225 no editor seemed , initially at least , is prepared to risk the backlash			0
' amid all the media navel - gazing there seems to be a genuine fear that the press feels it is no longer drinking in " @entity231 " but time has already been called			0
' what happens in vegas ... does n't stay in vegas : the party - loving royal was enjoying himself - but it is unclear as to what sort of reaction he will face on his return home surrounded by new - found friends , the @entity1 did not have a care in the world - until everyone else saw the photos the existence of the photographs – and the palace ’s attempts to ban the media from using them – were quickly picked up by all the major broadcasters including the @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 who featured prominent reports on the issue in their major news bulletins , highlighting they were also prevented from reproducing them			1
bare - chested and wearing sunglasses , he blends in perfectly with the rest of the pool party revellers			0
but the man sharing prince @entity1 ’s @entity264 in @entity3 is in fact his taxpayer - funded police protection officer			1
the unnamed @entity13 officer , on the left in the picture above , was one of at least three personal protection officers tasked with guarding the 27 - year - old prince round the clock on his @entity32 holiday			1
his police detail is estimated to cost the taxpayer £ 2million a year , and the photos are bound to raise questions at the highest level			0
@entity278 , the former head of @entity13 ’s @entity279 , said it was a ‘ very tricky situation ’ for the officers			2
but he added : ‘ i ’m not exactly sure how [ protecting @entity1 ] can be done when you are wearing your swimming trunks in a @entity264			1
where is his gun for a start ? and if he is not deemed to need one then is there any justification for him being there ? ’ @entity1 landed at @entity292 from @entity293 shortly before 4pm yesterday			2
despite reports that he would be dragged up to @entity296 to explain himself in person to both his grandmother and father who are holidaying on their private estates , royal sources said they were not aware of this			0
but the prince – and his @entity13 bodyguards – will be expected to explain just how he ended up partying naked with a group of ‘ hot chicks ’ he had apparently just met in his £ 5,100 - a - night suite in the five - star @entity125 and , more importantly , why they were allowed to film it			2
the @entity95 ’s former press secretary , @entity311 , said @entity1 was a ‘ loose cannon and should n’t be left alone ’			1
@entity314 mp @entity313 added : ‘ this is a first for the royals and a new low for the royal protection team			2
’ the latest incident to involve the party - loving prince , who turns 28 next month , has come as a huge disappointment to his palace advisers , who had been buoyed by @entity1 ’s growing maturity			1
his decision to retrain as a pilot , proving himself good enough to fly the military ’s most high - profile attack helicopter , the @entity328 , with a view to returning to the front line in @entity331 had apparently helped him turn a corner			0
earlier this year he undertook his first official foreign tour on behalf of the @entity95 and charmed statesmen and members of the public alike from the @entity337 to @entity338 with his puppyish enthusiasm			0
the trip was deemed such a success that there was already talk of another next year if his military commitments permitted			0
as a result the prince was also asked to become an official @entity348 ambassador			0
his most significant job came less than two weeks ago when he was asked to stand in for the @entity95 at the closing ceremony of the @entity351 in front of an audience of billions			0
moment of realisation ? @entity1 arrived in @entity293 just an hour after the photos surfaced on the internet and spent much of his time on his mobile phone suggesting that the news had been broken to him explaining himself ? the young prince was on holiday after an exemplary performance as an @entity366 ambassador - but his good work might unravel after the publication of photos of his antics tense : in blue shirt , cream panama hat and sunglasses , the prince looked apprehensive as he waited outside a restaurant in trendy @entity376 @entity377 left @entity3 on tuesday , arriving in @entity293 just an hour after his naked photos hit the internet			1
in blue shirt , cream panama hat and sunglasses , the prince looked apprehensive as he waited in a car park outside a restaurant in trendy @entity376			1
while his friends ate inside , he spent much of his time on his mobile phone suggesting that the news had been broken to him .			0
