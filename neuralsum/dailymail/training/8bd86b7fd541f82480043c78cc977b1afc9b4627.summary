by @entity0 young people who have read the @entity4 books are less likely to discriminate against minority groups , a new study claims			1
researchers believe that people who recognise the main characters ’ battle against evil @entity10 are more likely to tolerate minority groups such as homosexuals and refugees			1
they are most likely to show empathy towards immigrants and refugees if they strongly identify with the character @entity4 , who stands up for small groups of people and creatures throughout the story			1
scientists believe that people who identify with @entity4 's battle against evil @entity10 ( pictured right ) are more likely to tolerate minority groups such as homosexuals , immigrants and refugees and in real life a political science professor claimed that @entity4 is partly responsible for @entity28 being elected as @entity30 president			1
last year professor @entity31 said that the moral tales found in the best - selling books ' played a small but not insignificant role ' in influencing voters in both elections in 2009 and 2012			0
he argued that fans took on - board key themes in the novels , including lessons of tolerance and diversity , which made president @entity28 and the @entity44 appeal to them more than the @entity46			0
professor @entity31 , at the @entity48 , said that millennials , who are born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s and comprise the core of @entity53 's fan base , were so taken with the novels ' moralistic themes it influenced their political persuasion			0
researchers from three @entity61 universities and the @entity62 in @entity63 , surveyed 34 @entity61 school children in year five of primary school to look at their attitudes towards immigrants , @entity58 reported			1
they then read them sections of the @entity4 books over six weeks that focus on the parts to do with prejudice , such as the @entity74 ’ negative attitude to ‘ muggles ’ such as @entity77 who they do not consider pure blood wizards			0
much of the series of novels centres around the young wizards ’ quests to stand up for minority groups , whether they are house elves kept as servants or persecuted ‘ mud - blood ’ wizards			1
they found that following the readings , the children showed more empathy towards immigrants and those who were most sympathetic , strongly identified with the protagonist , @entity4			1
their study says that the younger children responded to @entity4 ’s positive attitudes towards ‘ stigmatised fantastic groups , ’ leading the experts to conclude that the children improved their attitudes to gay people and immigrants			2
based on a survey of @entity61 school children , the reserachers found that people are most likely to show empathy towards immigrants and refugees ( pictured ) if they strongly identify with the character @entity4 , who stands up for small groups of people and creatures throughout the story in a second survey , the social scientists found that two groups of college students in the @entity119 and @entity61 also altered their attitudes towards political refugees having read excerpts of the books			1
they wrote in the study , published in the @entity125 : ‘ @entity4 book reading was positively associated with perspective toward refugees only among those less identified with @entity10			2
perspective taking , in turn , was associated with improved attitudes toward refugees			0
’ the scientists believe that ‘ reading the novels can potentially tackle actual prejudice reduction , ’ even though the books ’ author , @entity53 insisted that she did not write them with that specific intention in mind			2
in 2003 , she told journalist @entity140 : ‘ i ’ve never set out to teach anyone anything , ’ but later admitted that she wanted @entity4 to experience similar problems in the wizarding world than those in our own			0
like other literary critics , the scientists found parallels between the evil character @entity10 and @entity151			0
‘ the @entity4 books in general are a prolonged argument for tolerance , a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry , ’ @entity53 is quoted as saying in the book @entity4 ’s @entity153 , by @entity154			2
the scientists believe that ' reading the novels can potentially tackle actual prejudice reduction , ' even though the books ' author , @entity53 insisted that she did not write them with that specific intention in mind			0
