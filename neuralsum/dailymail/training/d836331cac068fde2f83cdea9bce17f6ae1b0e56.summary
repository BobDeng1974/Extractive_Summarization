humans have long been fascinated by the lizard 's ability to shed and regrow its own tail			1
and now scientists have identified the genes that trigger new tissue growth after a lizard sacrificed its appendage to escape a predator			1
they believe the ‘ genetic recipe ’ could lead to muscle and nerve regeneration in humans			1
scientists have discovered that green anole lizards ( pictured ) turn on at least 326 genes to regenerate their tail and using this ' genetic recipe ' they could one day work out how to grow new human tissue scientists from @entity21 used gene sequencing technology to study the process in the green anole lizard , @entity19 carolinensis			1
‘ lizards basically share the same toolbox of genes as humans , ’ said lead scientist professor @entity25			1
‘ lizards are the most closely - related animals to humans that can regenerate entire appendages			2
researchers at @entity34 ( @entity34 ) identified a biological pathway , called @entity36 ( extracellular signal - regulated kinases ) , must be constantly active for salamander cells to regenerate - a process not seen in the same way in other mammals			0
the discovery could help researchers unlock the ‘ regenerative potential ’ of cells across other animals , it was announced in june			0
in adult mammalian cells , the @entity36 pathway is not fully active			0
when forced to be , cells acquire a greater potential for reprogramming and regeneration			0
through the @entity36 pathway , proteins communicate signals from a cell ’s surface to the nucleus containing its genetic material			2
‘ while humans have limited regenerative abilities , other organisms , such as the salamander , are able to regenerate an impressive repertoire of complex structures including parts of their hearts , eyes , spinal cord , tails , and they are the only adult vertebrates able to regenerate full limbs , ' said @entity73 scientist dr @entity72 from @entity34 ’s @entity74			1
‘ we ’re thrilled to have found a critical molecular pathway , the @entity36 pathway that determines whether an adult cell is able to be reprogrammed and help the regeneration processes			2
‘ manipulating this mechanism could contribute to therapies directed at enhancing regenerative potential of human cells			0
’ ‘ we discovered that they turn on at least 326 genes in specific regions of the regenerating tail , including genes involved in embryonic development , response to hormonal signals and wound healing			1
’ a number of other animals , including salamanders , tadpoles and fish , can also regenerate tails - and sometimes limbs			0
they all employ what is known as the ‘ @entity101 ’ , which provides the molecular signals needed to control stem cells in many tissues including the brain , hair follicles and blood vessels			0
but lizards were found to have a unique pattern of tissue growth that is distributed throughout the tail			1
‘ regeneration is not an instant process , ’ said @entity112 , co-researcher on the study published in the journal @entity115			0
‘ in fact , it takes lizards more than 60 days to regenerate a functional tail			2
' lizards form a complex regenerating structure with cells growing into tissues at a number of sites along the tail			2
’ professor @entity25 added : ‘ using next - generation technologies to sequence all the genes expressed during regeneration , we have unlocked the mystery of what genes are needed to regrow the lizard tail			1
‘ by following the genetic recipe for regeneration that is found in lizards , and then harnessing those same genes in human cells , it may be possible to regrow new cartilage , muscle or even spinal cord in the future			1
’ in june , scientists announced that they have worked out how salamanders grow new limbs			0
the discovery could one say help researchers unlock the ' regenerative potential ' of human cells			0

scientists from @entity21 studied the green anole lizard , which can *re-grow* its tail if it loses it in an attack
it has a unique pattern of tissue growth that 's distributed throughout the tail
they found it turns on 326 genes in specific regions of the regenerating tail
' genetic recipe ' could be used to regrow new cartilage , muscle or even spinal cord for humans in the future
