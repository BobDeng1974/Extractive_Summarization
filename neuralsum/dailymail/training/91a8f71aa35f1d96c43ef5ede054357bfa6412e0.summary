by @entity1 reporter published : 15:16 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 15:16 est , 11 october 2012 @entity2 was definitely not a @entity3 , according to the most recent study of the prehistoric remains			2
the 9,300 - year - old skeleton actually has more in common with @entity7 , according to @entity8 , an anthropologist with the @entity9 who released an updated review of the bones wednesday			1
@entity8 found that @entity14 man 's skull has several similarities to the ancient coastal people in @entity17 , meaning he likely shares a common ancestor with modern day @entity7			2
unearthing the truth : dr. @entity8 found no evidence the @entity2 was a @entity3 since his discovery in 1996 , @entity2 has been presumed to be a @entity3 who lived in the region he was uncovered			2
the corpse is one of the complete ancient skeletons ever discovered			2
@entity2 was found accidentally by two spectators watching a hydroplane race in 1996 , on the bank of the @entity30 in @entity31			2
scientists were given 10 days to study the bones in 2005			1
@entity35 in @entity36 this is the most complete pre-human skeleton discovered dating back 2 million years			1
the ' @entity37 - these 800 - yeard old skeletons were found in @entity39 with rods piercing their chests , a ritual aimed at preventing dangerous people from returning as vampires			0
king richard iii - scientists say bones discovered this year under an @entity48 parking lot could belong to the monarch , buried in 1485			1
the skull is split by what appears to be a battle wound			1
@entity53 to be 3.2 million years old @entity54 is thought to be the remains of an early human anscestor , though the specimen is only 40 percent complete based on their findings and @entity8 's latest research , @entity14 man was likely 39 or 40 years old , stood roughly 5 - foot - 8 and weighed approximately 160 pounds			0
he was so strong that the bone in his right arm was curved , and he was probably a practiced spear thrower			0
an injury in his right soldier , a piece of bone floating in the joint , is often seen in people who throw javelins , scientists are still unsure how he died , with his skeleton in excellent condition besides one abscessed tooth			1
his skull showed evidence of having been fractured but had healed perfectly while his ribs had also been broken but healed less well			0
he probably had to constantly move to find food meaning his ribs could not rest to heal properly			1
researchers believe he was buried where his bones were discovered , laid to rest face up with his chin tucked down and his hands at his sides with palms down			1
@entity8 's report challenges years of assumptions besides @entity2 's presumed ties to @entity93			1
an isotopic analysis of the bones shows he was most likely eating a coastal diet of marine protein - most likely seals - rather than the grazing animals that would have surrounded him had he lived in @entity100			1
' they are not what you would expect from someone from @entity100 , ' @entity8 said			0
' you would have to eat salmon 24 hours a day and you would not reach these values			0
' a traveler : @entity8 says chemicals found in @entity2 's bones indicate a diet more in line with a coastal native than a man in the @entity100 @entity8 presented his findings tuesday at a meeting with @entity117 tribal leaders			1
@entity8 has been at the center of a decade - long legal battle with those same tribes to study @entity2 's body			1
tribal leaders who claim the bones are of @entity3 ancestry want to bury them according to @entity3 tradition			2
face from the past : a clay model of @entity2 made from his skull may the the face of a @entity131 ancestor in 2004 , a @entity133 @entity132 ruled the remains were not protected by the federal @entity135 because they were too old to credibly establish a link with modern @entity93			1
the @entity137 at the @entity138 has held the remains since 1998			0
despite @entity8 's findings , tribal leaders still believe @entity2 was a @entity3			0
new research indicates @entity2 was n't a @entity3 and was likely from a coast @entity143 , leader of the @entity145 people , thought a diet of lamprey eel could provide the same nutrients @entity8 found			0
' i hope you would think about some of these things , too , and add that to your equation , ' he told @entity155			0
but even without the dietary evidence , @entity8 said he was certain @entity2 was not a @entity3			0
' there is not any clear genetic relationship to @entity3 peoples , ' he said			2
' i do not look at him as a @entity3 ...			0
i ca n't see any kind of continuity			0
he is a representative of a very different people			0

skeleton has been the subject of lengthy legal battle
@entity168 can find no genetic link to @entity93
bones were in perfection condition at time of death except on abscessed tooth
