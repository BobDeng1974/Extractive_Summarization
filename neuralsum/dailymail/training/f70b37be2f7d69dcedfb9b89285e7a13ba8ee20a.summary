by @entity0 @entity1 : 05:41 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:35 est , 17 december 2013 more migrants came to @entity4 over the past decade than in the previous half century			2
from 2001 to 2011 , the number of foreign - born residents rose by 2.9million			1
yet in the 50 years beforehand only an extra 2.7million arrived from abroad			0
the figures – published by the @entity9 yesterday – show the impact of @entity12 ’s open - door immigration policy			2
a new wave of migrants , from @entity15 and @entity16 , is expected in the new year when labour market restrictions are lifted			0
the two countries are the poorest in the @entity19 and it is thought as many as 50,000 of their citizens a year will decamp to @entity4			0
the influx of @entity23 from 2004 has made them the second largest foreign - born group in the country , behind only @entity27			1
because of the upheaval of the @entity30 they occupied the same position in the 1950s , but then behind the @entity32			1
successive decades saw the arrival of waves of @entity35 , @entity27 , @entity36 and @entity37			1
this pushed the foreign - born population up from 1.9million in 1951 to 4.6million in 2001			1
by 2011 , it had soared to 7.5million , fuelled largely by arrivals from @entity42			2
it means 13 per cent of the population of @entity45 and @entity46 now comes from abroad compared with just 4.3 per cent in 1951			1
@entity47 to @entity4 dates back to the famine of 1840s and 19th century industrialisation			0
but numbers have fallen in recent years , because younger generations have not replaced older @entity32 who have died.polandin the wake of the @entity55 were the second largest group of foreigners in the @entity4 , but through the latter 20th century were overtaken by @entity36 , @entity58 and @entity59			2
when @entity23 joined the @entity19 there was a 10-fold increase in @entity23 in @entity45 and @entity46 from 2001 to 2011			1
indiain 1951 @entity27 was the third highest country of birth and the @entity27 population in the @entity4 almost doubled between 1961 and 1971			1
from 1961 until 2001 @entity27 - born was the second highest ranking @entity66 country of birth and in 2011 became the largest foreign born @entity67 third highest foreign - born population since the 1980s , the @entity36 - born population grew fastest between 1961 and 1971 to 136,000			1
like @entity27 , the numbers have been fuelled by people moving to join family members and studying in the @entity73 the top 10 since 1961 , the @entity69 - born population grew fastest from 1951 , peaking in 1971 at 171,000 before falling to 160,000 in 2011			1
‘ migration has contributed to just under half – 45 per cent – of the total population change of the last 60 years , ’ the @entity9 report said			2
sir @entity78 of the @entity80 think - tank said the statistics confirmed an influx without precedent in @entity4 history			0
‘ it is impossible to believe that this has happened by accident over such a long period			0
it could only have been deliberate policy			0
two former @entity12 home secretaries apologised last month for blunders over eastern @entity93 immigration			0
@entity94 said the policy had been a ‘ spectacular mistake ’ while @entity96 admitted ‘ they got the sums wrong ’			0
the @entity9 report said : ‘ migration broadly is influenced by push and pull factors at source and destination , including economic condition , personal and national , pre-existing connections through family and cultural links , and political factors			0
‘ cultural factors , including education and the wide use of the @entity114 language globally are also pertinent			0
' @entity116 and @entity117 ties may have influenced migrants ’ choice of destination country			0
’ in some cases the @entity9 picture is skewed by historic movements of @entity4 people to foreign countries			0
people from @entity27 living in the @entity4 include those , such as @entity128 or @entity129 , born during the last years of imperial rule			1
the 7.5million figure for the number of foreign - born residents may be far too low , because it takes no account of illegal immigration			1
a study from the @entity137 estimated the number of people with no right to be here ranges from 417,000 to as high as 863,000			2
many will be overstayers who have remained after visitor or education visas ran out			0
others will be asylum seekers who have not returned home when their claims to refugee status have been rejected , or people who have smuggled themselves in , some from @entity153 to @entity155 ports			0
similarly , many @entity58 - born people here are children of @entity4 soldiers who served in @entity58 in the years after 1945			2
‘ for each of the top five @entity66 countries of birth in 2011 , migration to the @entity4 in substantial numbers began at different times , ’ the report said			2
‘ the @entity166 had an earlier historical flow , with 38 per cent of @entity32 - born residents in 2011 arriving before 1961			1
by contrast 86 per cent of @entity23 - born residents arrived in 2004 or later			1
’ the @entity27 - born population doubled between 1961 and 1971 , and the @entity37 - born population doubled in the 1980s , it said			1
the major increase in immigration after 2001 included , alongside @entity23 and @entity42 , increases in migration from @entity175 , @entity176 , the @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 , the @entity9 found			0
more than 100,000 @entity175 arrived in the decade , spurred by civil conflict at home and opportunities in @entity45			2
the report added : ‘ a peak in arrivals of @entity178 - born residents can be seen in the period 2007 - 2009			1
this is most likely to be related to the economic crisis			0

in 1951 there were 1.9million *non-uk* born residents in @entity45 and @entity46
by 2011 the figure had leapt to 7.5million , or 13 *%* of the population
census records show how @entity27 overtook @entity32 as number one origin
