by @entity0 published : 08:06 est , 22 march 2012 updated : 12:05 est , 22 march 2012 when @entity2 sang about green eyes in his eighties song , @entity5 , he probably did n't realise that years later his own eyes would be compared to those of a feline			1
but it appears that @entity2 shares similarly mismatched colour eyes to @entity12 - a white domestic cat from @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 @entity18 , who has one green and one gold eye , was born with a feline form of complete heterochromia , a condition that also occurs in some other animals			1
the condition most commonly affects white - coloured cats but may be found in a cat of any colour , provided that it possesses the white spotting gene			1
mismatched : @entity18 was born with bi-coloured eyes - one is blue and the other is gold			1
she has a feline form of complete heterochromia , a condition that also occurs in some other animals it appears that @entity2 shares similarly mismatched colour eyes to @entity12 - a white domestic cat from @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 but @entity2 's different colour eyes are the result of being punched at secondary school , by a school friend			1
the impact tore the sphincter muscles in @entity2 's left eye and although he had several operations , his pupil remains permanently open			2
this causes the eye to look like it is a darker colour , but it is actually the same shade			0
@entity52 took the photographs of odd - eyed @entity18 as she kept her company at her desk			0
mrs @entity52 said : ' she belongs to the owners of the print shop where i work as a graphic designer			0
' i took some photos of her playing with my computer mouse while she was helping me out with my work			0
' she 's a sweet tempered cat that loves attention - when she 's not curled up in a corner asleep			2
' @entity18 is also deaf , but @entity52 and @entity12 's owners say she copes well nonetheless			0
feline friendly : @entity18 , who is deaf , belongs to the owner of a print shop and @entity52 took this snap of the white cat when she came and sat next on her desk while she worked			0

appears that @entity2 shares similarly mismatched colour eyes to @entity12 - a white domestic cat from @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16
