by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 couple : @entity4 and @entity5 were due to leave their home in @entity8 this morning for @entity9 a @entity11 couple facing extradition to @entity13 in a row over expenses are feared to have attempted suicide just hours before they were due to be handed over to @entity13 marshalls			1
@entity4 and @entity5 were last night being treated on separate hospital wards for a suspected overdose as police stood guard outside			1
the couple , both 58 , had previously warned they would rather take their own lives than face the prospect of dying in a @entity13 jail			1
now their supporters fear that the moment they are ruled fit to travel , they will be handed over to @entity13 officials by @entity11 police			1
they were due to hand themselves in ahead of a flight to @entity13 at a @entity9 police station at 10am yesterday			1
but police were called when they failed to answer the door to early morning visitors to their home in @entity8			1
officers who forced their way in with a battering ram at 7am found @entity43 and mrs @entity5 upstairs at their £ 600,000 four - bedroom detached house			1
mr @entity46 was helped to walk from the property to an ambulance			0
mrs @entity5 , who was pale but conscious , was taken to another ambulance on a stretcher			1
mr @entity46 ’s father @entity51 drove 20 miles to visit the couple from his home in @entity54 , @entity55			2
he said his son ‘ was n’t really with it ’ and declined to comment further			0
the case has chilling echoes of the case of @entity63 ’s sufferer @entity61 , who doctors warned might take his own life if attempts were made to bundle him on a plane to the @entity13 for computer hacking			2
mr @entity61 was saved by home secretary @entity69 after a lengthy @entity71 campaign			0
last night his mother @entity72 told the @entity71 : ‘ will our politicians wait until someone dies before they change this horrendous extradition treaty that appears to be being abused by the @entity13 ? ’ despite pleas from the @entity80 ’ lawyer for a 14 - day stay , the @entity77 was last night insisting there was nothing it could do , and any fresh appeal must be lodged with the courts			2
the couple have already exhausted the normal appeal process			0
police and ambulance called : a view of the house belonging to @entity43 and mrs @entity5 in @entity8 the case has provoked outrage over the use the @entity96 to haul the couple across the @entity98 for trial for what their supporters say amounts to a civil dispute			1
mr @entity46 is accused of over-claiming expenses when he was chief executive of @entity13 company @entity106 and his wife of aiding and abetting her husband			1
they insist his were ‘ wholly legitimate ’ business expenses signed off by a senior director at the company			0
mrs @entity72 added : ‘ the @entity80 have been charged with exaggerating their expenses			2
' extradition should only be used for those who have committed heinous crimes , such as terrorism , not this sort of thing			0
' these people are being dragged from their own country before any evidence has been heard			0
the fact that this seems to have driven the @entity80 to attempt to take their own lives shows that extradition can be worse than death			0
’ treatment : the couple were taken to @entity128 ( pictured ) by ambulance this morning @entity130 , director of policy at @entity132 , said : ‘ the @entity80 ’ ordeal is a terrible indictment of our dangerously unfair extradition laws			2
politicians who talked reform but repeatedly failed to deliver – and in fact made things worse – should think hard about their actions today			0
’ mr @entity46 ran the @entity11 arm of the @entity13 soldering iron manufacturer , and his wife worked in sales at the company			2
after more than 25 years ’ service they were asked to move to the @entity13 in 2005			2
@entity149 , the owner of @entity106 , promoted mr @entity46 to chief executive after removing his son @entity151 from the company			1
the couple say he agreed the firm would pay their relocation costs			2
but in may 2009 , after mr @entity149 brought his son back into the business , the couple resigned due to disagreements with him and returned to the @entity11			1
@entity159 now claims that between 2002 and 2009 the couple embezzled more than $ 1million ( £ 600,000 ) in company expense claims			0
defeated : the pair lost a @entity164 battle last month against extradition to @entity166 to stand trial over charges relating to 58 - year - old mr @entity46 's company , @entity106 in december 2011 mr @entity46 was indicted on 13 counts of fraud and money laundering by a grand jury in @entity174 , @entity166			1
he could face a maximum jail sentence of 340 years			0
his wife was indicted on eight counts of fraud with a possible sentence of 240 years			0
last night a close friend of the @entity80 visited them in hospital and said their condition was ‘ greatly improved ’			0
@entity185 , 42 , said he had been told they had been ‘ tipped over the edge ’ after their mp , @entity182 @entity181 , who had been lobbying on their behalf , told them that the home secretary was unable to halt the extradition			0
he added : ‘ @entity4 and @entity5 were in their bedroom and were in a bad way			1
they could not tell the paramedics what they had taken , but i think it was quite clear to the ambulance crew what had happened			0
