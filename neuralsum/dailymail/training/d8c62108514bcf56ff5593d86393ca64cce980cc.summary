by @entity0 published : 16:59 est , 8 march 2012 updated : 11:08 est , 10 march 2012 @entity1 and @entity2 have been forced to change their recipes in @entity4 to avoid having to put cancer - warning labels on their cans - while the drinks in @entity8 stay the same			1
there were concerns that one of the food - colouring ingredients may cause tumours in mice - although there was no evidence of a similar risk for humans			2
nonetheless both manufacturers have altered their recipes for drinks sold in @entity4 and they now contain far less of the offending chemical			1
always coca - cola : the company are adjusting their colouring formula to dodge having a cancer label on the product but products sold in the @entity8 will still be made to the same old recipe as @entity30 regulators do not believe they pose any health risks			1
officials point out that one would need to drink 1,000 cans of @entity34 a day to get the same dose of the chemical that was linked to tumours in mice			2
studies in the lab had found that the ingredient ' 4 - methylimidazole ' - which gives the drink its caramel brown colour - caused cancer in mice and rats			1
this led to the state of @entity49 adding the chemical to its official list of ingredients that may cause cancer - or ' carcinogens ' - earlier this year			2
chemical : @entity53 , used in @entity34 's colouring , causes cancer in rodents under the state 's law , @entity1 and @entity2 would have had to put cancer warning labels on bottles and cans alerting the public to the possible risk			0
this may well have put many customers off from buying the drinks so the manufacturers instead decided to change the recipes for products sold in @entity49			1
over the next few weeks they will roll out the new versions across the rest of @entity4			1
but the @entity72 , which assesses the risk of food and drink across the @entity76 , does not believe the ingredient poses any danger			0
a spokesman for the @entity80 said for this reason the drinks sold in @entity8 will remain exactly the same			1
they said : ' the @entity72 recently looked at 4 - methylimidazole and concluded it does not pose a health risk to humans			0
based on available evidence , the presence of 4 - methylimidazole in colouring agents is not a food safety concern			1
' it is very rare for @entity1 and @entity2 to change their recipes however			0
in fact when @entity1 tried to make the drink slightly sweeter in 1985 and relaunched it as ' @entity34 ' in the @entity4 there was a public outcry			1
less than three months later the company announced it was reverting back to the original recipe			0
a @entity1 spokesman told @entity101 that rather than ' changing its recipe ' it was simply changing the production process of one of its ingredients			0
' the caramel colour in all of our products has been , is and always will be safe , and the @entity110 is not changing the world - famous formula for our @entity1 beverages , ' she said			1
' over the years , we have updated our manufacturing processes from time to time , but never altered our @entity115			0
' we have asked our caramel manufacturers to modify their production process to reduce the amount of @entity53 in the caramel			1
' but that will have no effect on the formula or on the great - tasting , high - quality products that consumers expect from us			0
' these modifications will not affect the colour or taste of @entity1			2
our commitment to the highest quality and safety of our great brands remains our top priority			2
' and we will continue to rely on sound , evidence - based science to ensure that our products are safe			0
' the exact recipe of the fizzy drink have always been a mystery			0
today 's official recipe is rumoured to be guarded 24 - hours a day in a vault in @entity142			0
the list of ingredients below are meant to be those used by pharmacist @entity146 , who created the drink in 1886 .			0

both firms to alter the way caramel colour is produced
changes will take place in the @entity4
but not in @entity8 as the drinks meet @entity30 safety rules
