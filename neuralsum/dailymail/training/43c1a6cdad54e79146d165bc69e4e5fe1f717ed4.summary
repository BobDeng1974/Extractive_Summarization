former @entity1 captain @entity0 is backing @entity2 to have a great @entity3 despite @entity5 ’ criticism of the @entity1 and @entity7 striker			1
@entity5 claimed @entity2 is past his best and questioned if manager @entity8 has the guts to drop him			1
but @entity0 , who saw @entity1 draw with @entity10 here , said : ‘ i ’d always back “ @entity2 ” because he ’s a great talent and he ’s a great player for @entity1			1
every time he ’s stepped out in an @entity1 shirt , he always gives 110 per cent			2
@entity5 is a person that knows @entity2 as well and has been around him for quite a few years and everyone is entitled to their opinion but not everyone is going to agree with it			1
thumbs up : @entity0 has backed @entity2 to have a good @entity3 ‘ in the games i ’ve seen him play for @entity7 , he ’s been the shining light			1
but @entity5 ’s been around him more than i have			2
’ @entity0 agrees that @entity2 will be frustrated at not having scored in eight @entity3 finals games in 2006 and 2010 but he added : ‘ he has always been about more than just scoring goals , he ’s a goalscorer but he works hard for the team and that is what @entity2 ’s game has always been about			1
‘ if he does n’t score goals he ’s either assisting or creating something for the team and working hard for the team			0
i think for the opposition to see @entity2 on a team sheet , that scares them			2
’ pressure : @entity2 has come under fire from former team - mate @entity5 big tournament : @entity2 says he is fit going into this @entity3 @entity0 does n’t know why @entity5 , his previously low - profile friend from the class of 92 at @entity7 has suddenly become so vocal , especially in the spat with @entity2			1
@entity0 said : ‘ @entity5 does n’t say much , but when he says it , it ’s always cutting , he ’s got a sharp tongue			1
’ as well as backing @entity2 , @entity0 is enthused by the youngsters that manager @entity8 has selected			1
‘ i ’m really excited about @entity1			2
they ’ve got some really good young players in there			0
@entity8 has gone for that group , it makes it promising with the experienced players in there as well			0
‘ will the young players be ready for a stage like this ? yes because they ’re playing in the biggest league in the world , week in week out and so i do n’t see why they will go over there and be afraid to play			0
they are confident performers who will not be scared			0
’ critical : @entity5 said @entity2 was past his best @entity67 ’s @entity69 is the one out of the @entity8 youth pack to have caught @entity0 ’s eye , with @entity1 ’s most capped outfield player saying : ‘ i think he ’s a great talent , he plays with the flair of a kid who goes out and just plays			1
the games i ’ve seen him play for @entity67 and @entity1 , he ’s just stepped into a role and deserves to be here			2
‘ ( @entity75 ) @entity74 has had a great season			0
he ’s a talent that can hurt people			0
@entity79 will hopefully recover from his injury , which is looking not as bad as everyone thought at the time , because he was exceptional the other night			0
’ asked about another young talent , @entity84 , wearing his no 7 shirt , he joked : ‘ i ’d rather i had it , but to be fair i had it for a few years and @entity84 has done well			0
’ pressing for a start : @entity89 is pushing for a place in @entity1 's starting line up in contention : as is @entity69 , despite his suspension on saturday @entity0 also praised captain @entity94 , saying : ‘ people talk about players from the @entity97 being tired going into the @entity3			1
but @entity98 ’s looking as fresh as anything and he ’s one of the older players			0
‘ he ’s an exceptional player and @entity98 will have the team ready for @entity102			0
’ @entity0 , who is taking his sons to @entity102 for the semi-finals and final , added			2
‘ hopefully , @entity1 will still be in it			0
