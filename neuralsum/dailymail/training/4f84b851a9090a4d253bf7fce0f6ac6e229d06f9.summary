by @entity0 last updated at 10:51 pm on 21st august 2011 former prime minister @entity1 says the riots are caused by youths from ' profoundly dysfunctional ' families @entity1 yesterday took a swipe at @entity7 ’s ‘ muddle - headed ’ handling of the fallout from the riots			1
in a rare intervention in domestic politics , the former prime minister suggested mr @entity7 was wrong to blame the riots on a general ‘ moral decline ’ in @entity13			1
‘ i think we are in danger of the wrong analysis leading to the wrong diagnosis , leading to the wrong prescription , ’ he said			2
but he risked charges of hypocrisy by admitting that , when in opposition , he had exploited the 1993 murder of toddler @entity23 by two ten - year - old boys to make political points about a wider ‘ moral breakdown ’ in society			2
mr @entity7 said last week that he was determined to tackle a ‘ slow - motion moral collapse ’ and mend @entity13 ’s ‘ broken society ’			1
yesterday he pledged to lead a fightback against the ‘ destructive culture ’ which he said had taken hold			1
but mr @entity1 said the riots were largely due to the actions of a hard core of problem families rather than a wider moral decline			1
he spoke out as it emerged that @entity40 believes up to 30,000 people were involved in looting , arson and criminal damage during the riots in @entity46			1
@entity48 figures show 3,296 crimes were committed during four days of rioting in the capital			0
between five and ten people were linked with each crime , so police believe they may be looking at between 15,000 and 30,000 suspects			0
not a major problem : mr @entity1 said that ' alienated youths from dysfunctional families ' were the main cause of this month 's rioting mr @entity1 suggested the prime minister was wrong to order a review of all social policy in the wake of the riots			1
‘ focus on the specific problem and we can begin on a proper solution , ’ mr @entity1 said in an article in the @entity67			0
‘ elevate this into a high - falutin ’ wail about a @entity13 that has lost its way morally and we will depress ourselves unnecessarily , trash our own reputation abroad , and worst of all , miss the chance to deal with the problem in the only way that will work			1
’ mr @entity1 said politicians ‘ miss the point ’ about the riots when those on the @entity82 say the culprits were victims of social deprivation and those on the @entity86 say they needed to take responsibility for their actions			2
he said the main problem lay with alienated youths from dysfunctional families living ‘ at odds with any canons of proper behaviour ’			0
mr @entity1 says @entity7 and @entity96 's parties are missing the true cause behind the riots he went on : ‘ the key is to understand that they are n’t symptomatic of society at large			1
failure to get this leads to a completely muddle - headed analysis of what has gone wrong			0
@entity13 as a whole is not in the grip of some general “ moral decline ”			1
’ mr @entity1 accepted that he made a mistake in 1993 when he suggested , as shadow home secretary , that the killing in @entity109 of two - year - old @entity23 had deeper causes in the breakdown of communities			0
he said at the time : ‘ we can not exist in a moral vacuum			2
if we do not learn and then teach the value of what is right and what is wrong , then the result is simply moral chaos which engulfs us all			2
‘ i have no doubt that the breakdown of law and order is intimately linked to the break - up of a strong sense of community			0
and the break - up of community in turn is , to a crucial degree , consequent on the breakdown in family life			0
’ the speech helped to undermine @entity139 ’s @entity138 government			0
yesterday mr @entity1 said : ‘ i now believe that speech was good politics but bad policy			0

former prime minister says the riots are the *product* of a *modern* ' *phenomenon* '
says majority of @entity13 has not lost its moral compass
@entity7 blames ' *bureaucratic* *nonsense* and destructive culture ' which had led to looting
