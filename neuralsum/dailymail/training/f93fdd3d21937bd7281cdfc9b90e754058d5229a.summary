@entity0 kicks off on friday night			2
the perceived wisdom is that @entity2 and @entity3 will prevail			2
but @entity4 are potential dark horses , not just for the group but to make it to the latter stages - even the semi finals			1
the heat is on : @entity3 boss @entity11 is under pressure to make sure his side get out of the group new @entity15 boss @entity11 could well face humiliation if he does n’t take the @entity17 to the knockout phase			1
@entity4 ’s coach @entity19 promotes a high tempo , pressing , passing game that sees his team evolve from 3 - 3 - 1 - 3 to 4 - 3 - 3 in the blink of an eye			1
looking to shock : @entity26 and @entity27 hope to help @entity4 progress from their group @entity4 who should give @entity32 a bloody nose on friday are a team to watch if they do n’t suffer stage fright like @entity36 in 1994			1
they can certainly shake up this group and in @entity39 ’s @entity27 they have a top class player			2
it is to be hoped that , despite the revelations of @entity45 corruption and worries about security , safety and anti-state angst in @entity51 , joga bonito comes to the fore			1
but it can be revealed that even though @entity45 president @entity56 has been endorsed by his cronies to stay on as president for another term , @entity55 boss @entity54 will run against him in the autumn			1
drifting apart : @entity55 president @entity54 has refused to back @entity45 's @entity56 and may run against him kicking off in style : @entity62 and @entity63 perform during the @entity64 of the @entity65 up and running : the @entity65 was officially opened on thursday part of the ticket will be to strip @entity68 of the 2022 finals and cleanse @entity45 of a brown paper envelope ethos			1
the @entity71 want @entity72 to take over those finals			1
and despite denials have a strong chance not least because of cost			0
@entity71 chairman @entity77 now sees that as his raison d’etre			0
@entity79 's coming home ? @entity71 chairman @entity77 is keen to bring the @entity81 to @entity72 if there is a re-vote but it understood that @entity32 would be the politically pragmatic choice			1
i understand @entity87 and @entity88 will also make new bids , if - and it will happen - there is a new vote for the 2022 finals			0
i ’m looking forward to seeing @entity93 – remember him ? - in action for the @entity32			1
i reckon the @entity96 and @entity97 star , now with @entity98 , could make an impact even if the @entity100 eventually are overcome by chirpy @entity4			2
these are @entity93 ’s @entity102 thoughts ( if that is not an oxymoron )			2
from a land down under : @entity93 is one of the most experienced players in the @entity32 squad national pride : @entity109 is active on @entity102 and posted this picture to show his dedication to the cause @entity113 has not made @entity115 ’s @entity65 squad , which is probably just as well for @entity117 boss @entity116			1
@entity116 insists he does n’t like buying players on the evidence of international tournaments			0
so it would seem reports that @entity113 could return to the @entity122 for £ 3.5 million from @entity123 are on the money			2
return : @entity113 has been linked with a move back to @entity117 from @entity123 reports that @entity127 , now perhaps aged 65 - and - a - half , at least , will make a comeback this summer after his exploits at @entity130 have been grossly exaggerated , however do n’t dismiss the notion that the spring chicken that is @entity133 might still make an impact this summer for @entity135			0
and if @entity133 does notch - maybe against @entity115 - then he must , please , pay homage to @entity127 and dance by the corner flag			0
dance star : @entity127 was famed for his dance by the corner flag during the @entity65 in 1990 experienced head : @entity133 will look to help @entity135 progress marinade : accompaniments : * courtesy of www.healthyeating.co.uk food for thought : with @entity115 playing on friday night , here is a an easy fajitas recipe method turn on oven to 200 degree celsius and wrap the tortillas in tin foil			2
@entity159 slice the chicken pieces and onion and pepper			0
mix these together in a bowl and then add the marinade ingredients in the listed order			0
heat a griddle pan until hot and put the tortillas in the oven wrapped in the foil			0
add contents of the mixing bowl to the pan and keep them moving over a high heat using tongs so you get a nice charring effect			0
check the chicken is cooked all the way through and there are no raw parts			0
the idea is to get chicken that is still moist but charred on the outside , which requires the pan to be very hot			0
once cooked tip the pan contents into a large bowl and serve with the heated tortillas ( they should have been in the oven around 8 mins ) , salad and salsa			0
wine or beer ? wine : @entity4 vs @entity32 : @entity4 : co-op truly , @entity196 , @entity197 vs @entity32 : @entity199 / @entity198			1
beer : escudos vs @entity202 ( @entity202 ) @entity2 , who kick off their @entity65 defence on friday night against the country they defeated in 2010 final , @entity3 , have the second most valuable squad in terms of player values			1
according to @entity211 the @entity213 stars , with £ 50million @entity214 back at the sharp end are worth £ 590.1m			1
@entity72 ’s insurance value of their squad is the third highest at £ 550m while @entity218 rivals @entity219 have the lowest value at £ 18.3m			1
costly bunch : the @entity2 squad , including @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity214 are worth £ 590.1m leading the line : @entity227 , @entity228 and the rest of the @entity72 squad are worth £ 550.1m the total value of all 32 team is a staggering £ 6.2 billion here is a list of the team values : @entity236 £ 641.2m , @entity2 £ 590.1m , @entity72 550.1m , @entity51 £ 448.3m , @entity237 £ 394.8m , @entity238 £ 360.4m , @entity239 £ 355.3m , @entity3 £ 279.4m , @entity240 £ 279.3m , @entity241 £ 196.8m , @entity135 £ 195.8m , @entity242 £ 185.6m , @entity243 £ 165.8m , @entity244 £ 158.5m , @entity245 £ 144.1m , @entity246 £ 143.1m , @entity247 £ 138.5m , @entity248 £ 132m , @entity249 £ 110.7m , @entity250 £ 92.8m , @entity251 £ 84.3m , @entity115 £ 72.5m , @entity4 £ 72m , @entity32 £ 66.6m , @entity252 £ 65.2m , @entity36 £ 59.5m , @entity253 £ 53.2m , @entity254 £ 49.4m , @entity255 £ 48.9m , @entity256 £ 34.2m , @entity257 £ 24.4m , @entity219 £ 18.3m			1
@entity65 moment : let ’s not forget in the @entity260 the @entity261 had to support @entity262 at @entity65 finals			2
well some of us anyway			0
goal to remember : @entity266 celebrates his stunning goal for @entity262 against @entity3 in 1978 and was there ever a finer moment than @entity266 scoring that goal against @entity3 which has since been immortalised in the iconic movie @entity272			0
let ’s see if we can pull the , er , correct video from the vaults .			0

@entity56 to stand again for @entity45 president , but @entity54 looks set to run against him
@entity11 and @entity281 risk being *upstaged* by dark horses @entity4
@entity93 can *spearhead* @entity32 's charge at the @entity65
@entity72 squad worth £ 550m while @entity218 rivals @entity219 are worth just £ *18m*
