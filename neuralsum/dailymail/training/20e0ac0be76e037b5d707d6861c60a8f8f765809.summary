@entity1 scientists have fired harpoons into whale sharks , which can measure 30 foot in length , in a bid to decipher the creature 's annual journeys using @entity8			1
despite being one of nature 's giants and weighing in at 30 tons , the movements of whale sharks remain a mystery to scientists , who want to protect the species ' falling numbers			1
researchers from the @entity18 have satellite tagged a number of whale sharks to monitor their long - distance migrations from north - west @entity23 to @entity24 , which can see them traveling hundreds of miles in a few weeks			1

underwater photographer @entity42 , from @entity43 teamed up with dr @entity44 of the institute to cover the underwater research project in @entity47 , 800 miles off the coast of @entity23			0
mr @entity42 said : '' the whale sharks were tagged with a harpoon , that holds the pointed end of the tag and goes into the 10 cm thick skin			2
researchers from the @entity18 have satellite tagged a number of whale sharks to monitor their long - distance migrations from north - west @entity23 to @entity24 they will use the findings of their research to decipher the creature 's annual journeys using @entity8 and try and protect the species whale sharks are slow moving filter feeding giants claims of individuals over 14 metres long and are not uncommon they are the largest living non-mammalian vertebrate , rivaling many of the largest dinosaurs in weight the species originated approximately 60 million years ago they are found in tropical and warm oceans and live in the open sea with a lifespan of about 70 years scientists will follow the shark 's progress using the satellite tag and @entity8			1
he said : ' @entity80 of @entity81 has demonstrated that these animals undertake multi-annual and very long - distance migrations			0
' these journeys include over 12,00 miles from north - west @entity23 towards @entity24 , or 300 miles within a few weeks			0
' whale sharks may be huge but they are the gentle giants of the ocean			1
they feed off plankton and other tiny sea - creatures rather than hunting like other predatory fish			0
sadly these magnificent creatures are a vulnerable species and their numbers are thought to be falling			2
@entity80 of whale sharks has demonstrated that these animals undertake multi-annual and very long - distance migrations scientists want to study shark behaviour and their sometimes worldwide migration and feeding patterns however , marine experts like mr @entity42 and dr @entity44 are battling to learn more about the planet 's largest fish before they are in danger of being lost forever			1
mr @entity42 said : ' my mission is to show people the beauty of sharks			0
' but i also want to present shark behaviour and their sometimes worldwide migration and feeding patterns			0
whale sharks may be huge but they are the gentle giants of the ocean			1
they feed off plankton and other tiny sea - creatures rather than hunting like other predatory fish ' sadly populations appear to have fallen thanks to harpoon fisheries in @entity24			0
' whale shark flesh is eaten , but their fins are valuable delicacies			0
mr @entity42 said : ' in the markets in the @entity128 , one fin from a whale shark can sell for over $ 15,000 ' the total from one single shark can exceed $ 60,000			0
' scientists want to understand the sharks ' feeding patterns			2
phd student @entity134 ( pictured ) examines plankton samples whale shark numbers are falling but their flesh and particularly their giant fin ( pictured ) is a delicacy in the @entity128			2

researchers from the @entity18 have tagged a number of whale sharks to study their migrations
the marine scientists will follow the gentle giants ' progress on @entity8
scientists will use the research to protect the species , whose numbers are thought to be falling
