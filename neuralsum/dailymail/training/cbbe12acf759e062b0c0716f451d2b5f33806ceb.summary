@entity0 , who has been openly attacked by @entity1 rattled by a fall in the party 's ratings @entity0 has been openly attacked by @entity1 rattled by a fall in the party ’s ratings following @entity10 ’s @entity9 conference speech			2
@entity11 said a poll conducted last week , which showed the @entity13 in the lead for the first time in nearly three years , should be a ‘ wake - up call ’ and accused his leader of ‘ complacency ’			1
the poll was taken immediately after mr @entity10 ’s pledge to cut taxes , and put the @entity13 on 35 per cent and @entity23 one point behind			1
in his outspoken remarks , mr @entity11 said he hoped the results would galvanise mr @entity0 into improving his performance			1
‘ this highlights the extraordinary level of complacency that permeates the top of the party , ’ said the @entity28 mp			0
‘ it should serve as a massive wake - up call			2
@entity0 should get out and mix with real voters to discover what they really care about , and then come up with policies on immigration and the economy which genuinely resonate with the electorate			0
’ mr @entity11 claimed that many backbenchers were infuriated by the so - called ‘ 35 per cent strategy ’ – targeting core @entity23 supporters in order to get to that position in the polls and then rely on the party ’s inbuilt advantage in the electoral system to deliver a small majority			1
‘ they seem to think we need just one more small push and we will limp over the line to victory , ’ he added			0
another @entity23 mp said : ‘ if i were to put into words publicly what i think about @entity0 right now i would be kicked out of the party ’			0
@entity1 left their party conference feeling gloomy about their election prospects after a lacklustre speech by mr @entity0 , in which he forgot to mention either the deficit or immigration			2

‘ it is the conservatives who look confident despite the pressure exerted by @entity93 , while it is @entity23 that appears politically on the back foot , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity10 has been forced to the @entity95 , but he still appears determined to make a wide national appeal			0
’ mr @entity85 added : ‘ key figures in the @entity23 fear that the party is reaching the limits of the 35 per cent strategy , having inexplicably abandoned a @entity102 agenda			2
