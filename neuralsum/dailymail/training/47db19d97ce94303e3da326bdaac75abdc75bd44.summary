@entity0 today admits his party ’s election prospects have been damaged by its ‘ @entity4 ’ characters			1
he says @entity5 got it wrong in the past and now needs to show greater discipline to secure success at the ballot box			1
but he warned against mimicking the command and control ethos of @entity12 's @entity2 machine , when pagers were issued to tell party members what to say at all times			1
@entity5 leader @entity0 said his party will clamp down on @entity4 characters before next year 's general election @entity5 is expected to come first in elections to the @entity21 on may 22			1
but mr @entity0 's party has been rocked by yet more revelations about the views of candidates and councillors which risk undermining his claim to be a mainstream political force			1
in the run - up to last year 's council elections , candidates were exposed for wearing a @entity35 mask , blaming the @entity36 on @entity37 and branding @entity38 an ' old w * * * * '			1
just this month mr @entity0 has had to suspend a councillor who blamed the winter storms on gay marriage			2
@entity43 humorist @entity42 wrote @entity44 for the @entity46 magazine in 1939			0
a @entity4 character was originally a harmless day - dreamer , who disengages from the real world by turning his small everyday failures and humiliations into grandiose fantasies , with himself cast as the hero			0
but over the years the name has acquired a more pejorative sense , coming to mean a self - deluding , self - aggrandising fraudster , who tries to gain respect by pretending to be something he ’s not			0
the story has inspired not one film — the celebrated 1947 version with @entity62 , which propelled the name ‘ @entity4 ’ into the @entity65 language — but two			0
@entity66 directed , co-produced and starred in @entity44 released last month			0
now the @entity5 leader is promising tougher vetting of candidates to weed out people who could cause him embarrassment			2
‘ it ’s very natural that a newish party will attract all sorts of people , ’ he told @entity72			0
‘ @entity77 seeking a role in politics – in the end they will let down not just us but themselves			0
‘ i need us to have a disciplined election machine			1
’ his comments come just a day after it emerged that a senior member of the party , @entity90 , apparently taunted a disabled student during an @entity93 debate			1
mr @entity90 was appearing at the debate last thursday and asked the young man whether he was @entity95 , the medieval king who suffered from a spinal deformity			2
last week the party was again embarrassed by one of its more controversial members , @entity98 , who claimed recent floods were divine punishment for new gay marriage laws			0
mr @entity0 said he wanted to ‘ professionalise ’ @entity5 ahead of the @entity104 elections in may in which his party are expected to trouble the @entity107			1
he suggested he may wish to curb the eccentricities of individual candidates and said the party must campaign together on similar issues			0
but mr @entity0 said he did not want @entity5 to turn ‘ into a new @entity113 outfit where they ’ve all got pagers on their belts and they ’re told what to say and think ’			1
keen to appeal to blue - collar people , he claimed a third of @entity5 ’s support derives from former @entity113 voters			2
he immediately risked alienating them , however , by saying that bankers were entitled to receive large bonuses			0
‘ the very thought that the bureaucrats in @entity125 now set the limits we can pay the highest earning people in @entity129 is truly astonishing , ’ he added			0
mr @entity0 said the party need to appear more professional if they are to succeed at the ballot box			1
his comments come as @entity90 , pictured , appeared to taunt a disabled student during a debate at @entity93 the stockbroker ’s son said : ‘ we do n’t need official caps or limits being placed on these things			1
do n’t forget that quite a lot of this comes back to people in terms of pension incomes and the rest of it			0
’ mr @entity0 also attacked high public sector pay , especially in local government , saying there were a ‘ remarkable ’ number of people working in local authorities and quangos who were on six - figure salaries			2
while @entity113 is facing a growing backlash in the business community as a result of its 50p tax rate plan , @entity5 has been courting big donors as @entity162 sentiment has increased in the @entity163			2
however , mr @entity0 refused to be drawn on any economic policies , nor would he be drawn into giving a date as to when the @entity167 deficit should be cut by .			0
