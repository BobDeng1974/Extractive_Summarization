the @entity0 said on wednesday that it does n't care that @entity1 deleted emails she says were personal and not in any way related to her work at the @entity5			1
nor did federal officials review them before @entity9 's team trashed them , it said , because they were part of her private communications			1
' frankly the secretary 's handling of her own personal email and the maintenance of her personal email inbox is something that i 'm not gon na comment on , and i 'm not particularly interested in , ' the chief spokesman for @entity14 , @entity15 , told reporters on wednesday			2
he also revealed that president @entity24 has n't spoken to @entity1 since it became public that she solely used a private email address while serving as secretary of state , saying it 's been at least a ' couple weeks ' since they last talked , as far as he 's aware			1
it 's been at least a ' couple weeks ' since they last talked , as far as he 's aware in an endeavor to put an end to the uproar , now in its second week , @entity9 held a press conference on wednesday at the @entity44 ' headquarters following her remarks to the body about women 's rights that , of course , does not mean that other senior administration officials have n't talked to @entity9 or her aides since the controversy began over @entity9 's personal email system , which she maintained on a private server located at her home in @entity59			1
in an endeavor to put an end to the uproar , now in its second week , @entity9 held a press conference on wednesday at the @entity44 ' headquarters following her remarks to the body about women 's rights			0
rather than quench the public 's thirst for information , @entity9 ginned up questions anew by admitting that she eliminated half of online correspondence from her tenure in the @entity24 administration - more than 30,000 emails - that she deemed private			1
asked about the matter on wednesday , the president 's top spokesman revealed that the executive branch did not sort through @entity9 's emails before she tossed them out , so it has no idea if she obeyed federal regulations			1
' the federal government did not review secretary @entity9 's personal email			1
secretary @entity9 's team did that , ' @entity15 said at his regular meeting with the @entity0 press corps			2
' it is not the practice of this administration to review the personal email of federal government employees , ' he added			1
' i do n't know of any previous administration that 's done that either			0
' it was ' the responsibility of her team , ' he said , to determine which emails were government property			0
' nobody has marshaled any evidence that i 've seen , at least , to indicate that they 've fallen short of what they said they did , ' he said			0
and now no one can , another reporter pointed out to the @entity24 administration official later , because the evidence appears to have been destroyed - a remark that earned giggles and snorting from the rest of the briefing room			0
@entity15 also suggested that the @entity0 was left out of the loop on @entity9 's decision to dispose of emails she says were personal in nature			1
' i was not aware of the personal email habits of the secretary , who maintained her personal email inbox , ' he retorted after @entity127 ' @entity126 asked him if the @entity0 knew of her plans			2
pressed to give an accounting of the email practice 's of someone he does keep tabs on - the president - @entity15 declined to go into detail as he has in the past , invoking security precautions			0
he did make clear that the president has followed the laws that apply to his communications , however			0
' the president does take very seriously the requirements that he is under based on the @entity145 , ' @entity144 act			0
' and i can tell you that , that all the emails the president sends are governed by that act and are properly maintained in accordance with the @entity145			0
' as far as @entity9 's records are concerned , @entity15 acknowledged that the matter is not as simple as saying , cased closed , and moving on while putting the onus on the press to do just that			2
given that the @entity5 has not finished reviewing her emails for release to @entity158 and to the public , it 's fair to say ' there 's ongoing work on this matter , ' he said			0
as it pertains to @entity9 's compliance with the @entity164 , though , which requires her to give the @entity5 copies of all her government emails , he indicated that the @entity0 had come to terms with the situation as it currently stands - that @entity9 's emails are out of the government 's reach and only she can choose to release them			1
seemingly exasperated with reporters ' nearly endless questions about @entity9 's emails , @entity15 also deflected a question about whether the @entity0 would offer up the the former cabinet official 's conduct as an example of ' model ' behavior given that she violated @entity5 and administration guidelines that warn against using personal email for business purposes			1
' those guidelines have been made clear , and they 've been further clarified over the last couple years as the president has taken steps to do exactly that , ' he said , referring to rules the president put in place after @entity9 left his service that are significantly stricter when it comes to email usage			2
so , she would n't be , the reporter said , prodding him			0
' i think we 've been very clear about what the guidance is			0
that was true last week , and that is true this week , ' the president 's spokesman wearily responded .			2
