@entity41 noticed the bank 's error while going through his friend 's accounts and informed the bank , which acknowledged the blunder and fixed @entity9 's credit history			1
but they went ahead with selling his home at a cut price auction , the @entity44 reported			0
@entity9 , who suffered from the rare blood - clot disorder @entity55 and was often hospitalized , had to move to a tiny apartment in an assisted - living home in @entity58			1
both the behemoth bank and @entity60 were in court for a preliminary hearing			2
the 62 - year - old was in a wheelchair in the back of the courtroom , preparing to testify			1
judge @entity67 told @entity41 the case facts did n't justify his client 's claim of fraud and negligence			0
after almost an hour going through bank documents to prove @entity5 's mistake and his friend 's innocence , @entity9 went into cardiac arrest			1
' he was sure that when a judge heard that he was never even late on a payment , that ( the judge ) would do something , ' @entity78 , a friend who accompanied @entity9 to court , told @entity44			1
in a statement , @entity5 called the death of their customer ' tragic ' but said he had no business being in the courthouse			0

' he was a very good guy , a simple man			0
he loved animals ' said his neighbor , @entity109 , who would look after the veterans cat on occasion			0
his attorney , @entity41 lived next door to @entity60 and often helped him clean his home when he needed hospital treatment for complications brought on by his @entity55			0
' @entity41 was his guardian angel			0
he was really good to @entity9 , ' said @entity109 said			2
' @entity9 would definitely get frustrated [ with the bank ] , but @entity41 was his guy because it was overwhelming for @entity9 to handle the pressure			1
' the disastrous chain of events began in march 2009 , when @entity9 's payment of $ 1,237 was n't processed by the bank , despite him knowing that he had paid his mortgage two months early since 2007			1
his bank , @entity125 , told him he was now behind on his payments , but because he was hospitalized at the time he asked his friend , @entity41 to examine the problem			0
@entity41 , 32 , discovered that @entity9 had unwittingly refinanced his mortgage four times since september 2007 and was unaware that extra service charges applied to his standard payments			1
this came to a head when his march 2009 payment was less than @entity9 ever assumed it would be			2
the bank would n’t accept @entity9 ’s march 11 , 2009 payment of $ 1,297 because his minimum payment of $ 1,297 was no longer enough , as the bank believed he owed a lot more in order to satisfy the tax situation			1
' they basically defaulted him on their own entirely from their own paperwork screw - up , ' said @entity41			0
but , even after the bank acknowledged their strong - armed errors , @entity125 , which was now owned by @entity5 refused to accept that @entity9 was not still currently defaulting on his mortgage			1

just a few months later , the home was re-sold for $ 440,000 according to public documents			0
court : despite records proving the bank was at fault , @entity9 still had to go to @entity25 , pictured , which is where , on december 19 , 2012 , he suffered a massive heart attack and died @entity5 's statement insisted the sick man he had no business being in the courthouse the day he died			1
' mr @entity9 ' passing was a tragic event and our deepest sympathies go out to his family and friends , ' the statement read			2
' in a tentative ruling posted on the court ’s web site the night before the scheduled hearing , the judge indicated she was prepared to dismiss all the claims put forward by mr @entity9 ' attorneys and rule in favor of our motion for summary judgment			1
given that there was no testimony or evidence to be presented at the hearing , there was no reason for mr. @entity9 to attend and it is truly unfortunate that he was brought there			2
' @entity41 told @entity44 that @entity9 had been requested to show up by the bank so they could determine whether he needed an independent guardian appointed by the court			1
' he was there to testify , ' @entity41 said			0
judge @entity190 is scheduled to make a decision january 17 on whether or not the case will go to trial , despite the dead of the plaintiff			0

' he was a very good person			0
he was kind of shy , and he had a really good sense of humor — really , he was a very simple guy who just liked to work and do his thing			0
