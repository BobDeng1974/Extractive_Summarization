a teenage girl in a coma after a catastrophic car crash came round just as doctors were about to declare her brain dead			1
@entity5 had had life support withdrawn on the advice of medics and was being prepared for organ donation			1
but to the astonishment of staff at the @entity13 , in @entity14 , the 19 - year - old suddenly opened her eyes and started moving her legs			1
her family is now suing the hospital for damages , claiming that doctors had been desperate to harvest her body parts			1
' those bandits in white coats gave up too quickly because they wanted an organ donor , ' her father @entity31 told the @entity14 newspaper @entity35			1
the family ’s lawyer @entity36 said that ms @entity5 keeps asking if doctors were trying to kill her			1
' of course this is a great trauma , both for her and her parents who were convinced that there was nothing else that could be done and agreed to donate her organs , ' he told the newspaper			0
hospitalised : when her brain activity began to fade , doctors believed there was very little chance of survival , and if she ever was to recover , she would be in a persistent vegetative state ms @entity5 , now 20 , crashed her car in october last year			2
she was in hospital for three days before doctors realised her brain activity was fading and consulted her family about stopping treatment			2
it was at this point they agreed to donate her organs			0
in a documentary about her life called ' the girl who would n't die ' , @entity5 says she is convinced she will recover and that hopes to move in to her own flat in the future			2
‘ and i will be working as a graphic designer and be able to ride @entity25 properly , ’ she said			0
no hope : after speaking to her parents it was decided that the apparatus which kept her breathing was to be turned off and organ donation was prepared awake : the family had already said goodbye when the hospital called and said @entity5 had opened her eyes the case has sparked a public debate in @entity14 about donations and end - of - life treatments , with registered donors withdrawing consent in fear of doctors acting too quickly			1
the @entity14 government is drawing up new guidelines to prevent doctors from making preparations to remove organs until the patient is officially declared clinically dead			2
however , medical experts say the preparations made before a patient is declared brain dead are vital to ensure that correct matches are made between organ donors and receivers			0
before : photographs of @entity5 aged 19 , before the horrific car accident in october 2011 accident : @entity5 was driving her car in october last year when she came off the road and flipped her car one @entity14 doctor who spoke to @entity104 said it was an unfortunate case of miscommunication between @entity5 ’s family and the doctors at @entity13			1
‘ the story says a lot about the importance of communication in a doctor - patient relationship , ’ the doctor said			0
‘ if the doctors had expressed themselves differently , the parents would not have felt so maltreated			0
’ ‘ from a medical point of view , no mistakes have been made			0
the girl was never declared brain - dead , that was never the case			0
' in fact , the doctors saved her life with the treatment they gave her			0
' and they were not going to ‘ take ’ her organs , it was merely a conversation about organ donation if she would become brain dead			0
’ the doctors at @entity13 hospital has apologised for the failures in communication during @entity5 's treatment and have said they made a mistake .			1
