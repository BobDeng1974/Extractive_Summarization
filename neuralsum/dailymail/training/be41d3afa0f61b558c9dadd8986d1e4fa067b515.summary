while animal lovers can bond over complaints of a dog chewing their prized book or a cat mangling their favourite socks , few can boast about having their camera gnawed on by a grizzly bear			1
environmental film - maker @entity11 now stands in that rarefied group , after going through the bizarre experience in @entity14 , @entity15 , recently			1
mr @entity11 has captured and shared the moment in a clip which starts off rather unassumingly			0
making the most of the weathered structure , the imposing creature scratches her nose - and even her bottom - against the edge of the bridge while enjoying what appears to be a lazy day			2
mr @entity11 , who says he visited the picturesque region to shoot an interview with bear biologist dr. @entity47 , recalls : ' while were filming we had a visitor			0
' the ' visitor ' is shown meandering along the bridge before looking over the edge to see the two humans sitting by the river as they chat			2
apparently unfazed by what she sees , she continues to sniff around before catching sight of the hidden @entity58 camera			0
suddenly , the camera is flipped over before going into the bear 's mouth - giving viewers a brief at her very large and sharp set of teeth			1
the bear curiously sniffs out her target as she inches nearer , pressing up snout up against the lens going in for the kill , the brown bear takes a large bite into the camera - and shows her large teeth the bear appears to be unwittingly taking a selfie as she continues to toy with the device after failing to find the taste appealing , the camera is spat out by the bear , who then proceeds to rub her snout all over the lens			1
she then gives the device another flip , showing the clawed paws of the bears surrounding her			0
mr @entity11 , who eventually retrieved the device , says : ' the bear removed the camera from its case and put a canine , or four , through the body			1
the @entity58 ( mostly ) still works when held together by duct tape			0
' while the unexpected moment created some fascinating footage , there 's still more to come - provided somebody with nifty tech skills can help out			2
explains mr @entity11 in a caption on the video : ' [ the bear ] had the camera for 2 mins and the last clip is corrupt			0
if anyone knows a rescue i 'll be happy			0
' after ejecting the camera from her mouth , the bear gives viewers something new to glance at the bear enjoys one last sniff of the now - damaged device as the brief clip draws to a close			1

the brown bear discovers the device while meandering along a bridge in a remote part of @entity14 , @entity15
she chews on camera while also giving viewers a peek of her sharp teeth
film - maker @entity129 says there 's more footage to be rescued
