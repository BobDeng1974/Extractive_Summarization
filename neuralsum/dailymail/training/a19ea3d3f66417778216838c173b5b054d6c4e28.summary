by @entity0 published : 10:50 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 14:20 est , 4 december 2013 for years @entity1 would try her best to dodge the camera at family occasions like @entity4 and birthdays because of her weight			1
the sales assistant , 28 , from @entity8 always felt like the odd one out growing up			1
she says her four younger female siblings , @entity10 , 26 , @entity11 , 24 , @entity12 , 23 , and @entity13 , 15 , were all ' skinny minnies '			1
approaching the peak of her weight , @entity17 with her sisters ( from left to right ) @entity10 , @entity12 , @entity11 and @entity13 @entity1 was sick of being the ' fat ugly one ' : ( left to right ) @entity12 , @entity10 , @entity17 , @entity13 and @entity11 at her biggest , @entity1 , who is only 5ft tall , weighed 15st 1lb			1
wearing a dress size 20 , she felt insecure next to her younger , slimmer sisters , whose sizes range from a diminutive size six to a 12 - 14 , and she loathed being photographed next to them			1
today , @entity1 , one of six siblings in total , says she finally feels like ' one of the pack ' after shedding six stone in just 12 months			1
incredibly , she now weighs just 9 stone and is a slinky size 8			1
' i feel amazing , ' says @entity1			1
' i no longer feel like the fat , ugly one			1
it was hard being the big one , strangers would n't believe we were related			1
@entity1 pictured with her slim younger sister @entity13 ' although i love my sisters dearly , i used to feel left out at times			1
whereas they used to have the usual sister squabbles over clothes , i could n't borrow theirs as i was too big to fit into them			1
i used to feel envious and wonder why i had to be the fat one			1
it did n't seem fair			1
' @entity1 first noticed she was different from her sisters when she was eight years old			1
' i seemed to put weight on more easily and had a bigger appetite			2
whereas my sisters were quite sensible with their food , i got into bad eating habits , ' she says			1
' it 's started by going to the shops and buying a chocolate bar after dinner and then i 'd scoff bags of crisps too			2
' my mum was concerned and tried to put me on a diet but it did n't work			1
i would carry on buying junk food and would guzzle cans of full fat @entity64 too			1
soon , my mum realised she was n't getting anywhere with the diet and gave up in the end			1
naturally , @entity1 hoped it was just puppy fat but when her weight spiralled out of control in her teens she knew that was n't the case			1
' i was just getting bigger and bigger , ' she says			2
' before i knew it i was a size 14 and weighed around 10 stone			1
bearing in mind i am only 5ft , the extra weight looked ridiculous on me			2
' i used to blame my slow metabolism and kid myself that i was bigger boned than my sisters , but that 's clearly not the case as we 're the same size now			1
but for a long time i used that as an excuse			2
' the fact her sisters ' dress sizes ranged from a size six to a @entity95 average 12 - 14 did n't help her self - esteem			1
' they used to get excited about fashion			0
they would prance around the house in short skirt and crop tops			0
all the boys fancied them in school and they were pretty and popular			0
' sometimes people would n't even believe we were sisters			2
it was really hurtful and i would get really upset over it			0
it 's not nice to feel like the fat , unattractive one when all your sisters are gorgeous and turn heads wherever they go , ' she says			2
despite their physical differences , @entity1 says she 's really close to all of her sisters and they would defend her if anyone said anything nasty about her size			1
' one time i was walking along when some guys drove by and shouted " fat b * * * * " out of the window			2
i burst into tears on the spot but my sisters were quick to shout back , ' she says			0
' they may be skinny little things but they 're feisty madams when provoked			0
that night , i cried my eyes out			0
i hated the way people thought they could be cruel to me just because i was a bigger girl			0
' after school , @entity17 went on to study health , social care and secretarial skills at college			0
her weight continued to spiral and @entity17 went up to 12 stone and was a dress size 16			1
@entity17 weighing 15 stone before ( left ) and at just nine stone after the weight loss ( right ) ' to be honest , i did n't try dieting			1
i just continued to eat the same junk food on top of my three meals a day			0
' and the pounds continued to pile on as @entity1 became increasingly unhappy			1
' when i started working at 18 i would be really tired when i got home and too lazy to make something for dinner			0
because i had money i 'd buy a greasy @entity157 takeaway and eat it in front of the telly			0
' that 's okay now and again as a treat , but i was doing it three times a week and seldom did any exercise			0
' @entity1 continued to put on weight and by 26 , she had ballooned to a size 20 and weighed 15.1 stone			1
' it was horrible , ' she says			0
' i felt so uncomfortable and disgusted with myself for letting my weight get so out of control			0
on nights out i never felt attractive or sexy next to my sisters			0
they used to get attention left , right and centre and i had to pretend to be happy being the fat , bubbly one			2
' it hurt when strangers would n't believe we were related			2
they 'd act really shocked and say we did n't look anything alike			2
i knew what they meant by that , my sisters were hot and i was the fat , ugly one			2
' it was a vicious circle , when i felt sad i 'd eat more to feel better			0
@entity185 was definitely a comfort for me			0
' @entity17 with her sister @entity11 ( left ) and relaxing on a day out ( right ) before weight loss in june 2012 , @entity1 realised she had to do something drastic about her weight when she went to the doctors to get her blood pressure checked - but the @entity194 belt did n't fit around her arm			1
' i was horrified and wanted the world to swallow me up			2
that night , i went home and cried			0
i knew i had to change my life - style , it was now or never , ' she says			0
shortly after , she joined @entity200			1
they devised a healthy eating plan for @entity1 , swapping unhealthy meals and replacing them with pasta , jacket potatoes , fruit and veg			1
' finally i 'd found a diet that worked for me , ' she says			0
' i could eat these carbs unlimited and was allowed 15 sins a day			0
after one week i lost over three pounds and the weight just continued to drop off			0
instead of a sugary cereal for breakfast , i 'd have porridge with a banana or a low - fat yogurt			2
' i ditched fizzy drinks and guzzled litres of water instead			0
on top of this , i started to walk more			0
' within just six months @entity1 had lost four stone and was a dress size 12			1
around this time , she met her fiancé , @entity223 , 24 , who works in construction , over the internet			1
' having a love interest in my life spurred me on even more so to lose the extra weight			0
five months after meeting @entity223 , i shed another two stone - taking me to a tiny size eight			1
' earlier this month , @entity17 won @entity230 of the month and @entity231 at @entity200			1
' i could n't feel better , ' she says			2
' i finally feel one of the girls and when i go out with my sisters they 're proud of me and show me off			0
' nowadays , strangers do n't blink an eyelid when we say we 're related			2
i 'm no longer the fat , bubbly one - i 'm also sexy and pretty like the rest of them			2
' i can finally borrow their clothes and talk about fashion with them			0
i do n't feel like the odd one out anymore			2
' her sisters are incredibly proud			0
' @entity17 's done so well , i 'm so proud of her			0
it used to make me so mad angry when people called her fat and other nasty names , ' says sister @entity12 , 23			1
' even when she was minding her own business walking to walk people would shout horrible things about her weight			0
but she always held her head high and kept going			0
she 's inspired me to lose weight , too			0
' ' i watched her lose weight bit by bit and she 's literally transformed in front of my eyes			0
it 's shed half her weight and it 's changed her life , ' says @entity10 , 26			2
' she 's a lot happier now and much more confident			0
i 've never seen her so determined to do something in her life , but she worked really hard to lose the weight and it 's really paid off			0
i 'm so proud of her , she 's an inspiration to everyone			0
