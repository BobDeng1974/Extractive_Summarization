lord @entity0 , pictured , has accused the @entity2 leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care @entity5 ’s pledge to rein in @entity7 ‘ privatisation ’ by capping profits of firms providing care has come under fierce attack from a former @entity2 health minister			1
as @entity2 made the @entity7 the central issue of its election campaign launch , lord @entity0 accused his party leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care			1
he said competition between different providers was vital to ensure the @entity7 can cope with spikes in demand , which occur most winters			2
‘ it is very difficult for the @entity7 to cope with the peaks and troughs of demand without the involvement of the private sector , ’ he said			2
kicking off his campaign at the site of the @entity31 in east @entity32 , mr @entity5 said the election ‘ may come down to the wire ’ , though his deputy @entity35 insisted @entity2 was already ‘ within touching distance of victory ’			1
his main policy announcement was that @entity2 would halt what he called a ‘ tide of privatisation ’ in the @entity7			1
firms brought in to provide free treatment to patients would be hit with a five per cent profit cap , he said			2
@entity2 said the cap would apply to all @entity7 contracts worth £ 500,000 or more			1
any company that made more than five per cent from the contract would be forced to reimburse the @entity7 for any returns above the level of the cap			1
local @entity7 commissioners would have the power to allow higher profits in exceptional circumstances , if approved by @entity57 or the health secretary			1
the cap would not apply to gps , pharmacies or dentists			0
mr @entity5 repeated his pledge to introduce a ‘ mansion tax ’ on expensive homes , impose a levy on the tobacco companies and close tax loopholes exploited by hedge funds			2
the £ 2.5 billion raised would pay for 20,000 more nurses , 8,000 more doctors , 5,000 new care workers , and 3,000 more midwives , he said			0
claiming another five years of @entity75 government would mean ‘ the disintegration of our public services ’ , mr @entity5 added : ‘ we ’ll scrap @entity80 ’s market framework for the @entity7 and stop the tide of privatisation			1
‘ the @entity7 will be the preferred provider			2
no company working with the @entity7 will be able to profit by cherry picking : rejecting patients with the more complex and expensive needs for their own advantage			0
‘ and , for the first time , we will cap the profits that private health companies can make from our @entity88			2
‘ the standard rule will be a five per cent cap			0
because the money we pay for our health care should be invested for patient care , not for excess profits for private firms			1
’ @entity5 kicked off his campaign at the site of the @entity31 in east @entity32 critics accuse party of hypocrisy , since expenditure on @entity7 services provided free of charge by private providers has risen at a slower rate since 2010 than in the four years before , when @entity2 was in power			1
overall , around just six pence in every pound is spent in the @entity7 with the private sector , compared to just under five pence under @entity2			1
@entity2 insists that the government ’s @entity7 reforms have accelerated the number private firms winning @entity7 contracts , with around one in three now going outside the health service			1
lord @entity0 , a health minister between 2003 and 2007 , pointed out @entity2 had expanded the use of private sector providers in the @entity7 – and insisted it could not now survive without them			1
of mr @entity5 ’s profit cap , he told the @entity124 : ‘ it runs the risk of being one of these pre-election promises which does n’t stand up when confronted with the reality of government			2
‘ it ’s far from clear how you would actually implement it			0
a lot of the private sector is currently providing services to the @entity7 at standards @entity7 tariffs			2
is that a profit ? @entity5 's main policy announcement was that @entity2 would halt what he called a ‘ tide of privatisation ’ in the @entity7 ( file picture ) ‘ if you want to scare people , you can scare people			1
but all the work that was done in the @entity149 government on choice and competition showed that people did n’t have concerns on whether work was done by the private or public sector			0
‘ what they were concerned with was whether they would have to pay and was their care safe			0
' the @entity2 peer said some senior people in his party appeared overly ‘ preoccupied ’ with the issue of private sector involvement in the @entity7 , insisting : ‘ it rather misses the point			1
‘ the point is what ’s the best quality of care we can provide for patients at a reasonable price			0
’ health secretary @entity172 said : ‘ if you bankrupt the economy like @entity2 did last time – then you ’ll put our @entity7 at risk			1
we can only have a strong @entity7 if we have a strong economy , but @entity5 does n’t have an economic plan			1
‘ we all know @entity2 want to “ weaponise ” the @entity7 but this is another policy from @entity5 that looks ill - thought through			1
it risks higher infection rates , higher waiting times and chaos for our @entity7			0
this incompetence is exactly why @entity5 is simply not up to the job			0
‘ independent commentators confirm that use of the private sector has grown at half the rate under this government as it did under , o this is no more than a gimmick to scare people about privatisation that is n’t happening			0
‘ the real issue for the future of the @entity7 is how to fund the growing needs of an ageing population , and by tearing up an economic plan that is working @entity2 would threaten the real increases in funding that conservatives are promising			1
no one can deliver a strong @entity7 without a strong economy			0
’ lord @entity0 , a health minister between 2003 and 2007 , pointed out @entity2 had expanded the use of private sector providers in the @entity7 – and insisted it could not now survive without them dr @entity205 , a consultant cardiologist at @entity206 , said of the profit cap : ‘ practically implementing something like this is going to be virtually impossible			1
’ most private sector bodies work both for the @entity7 and privately , and pooled costs , he said			0
‘ to try to figure out how much profit they make from the @entity7 is going to be nearly impossible			0
in fact , it may actually cost more money to go through the accounting papers than the amount it will save from making a cap			0
’ but dr @entity218 , chair of the @entity220 council , backed @entity2			0
‘ proposals to remove the most damaging elements of the @entity223 , to support more joined up care and to prevent the private sector from cherry picking the most profitable services are a step in the right direction , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity220 wants a publically provided and funded health service , and believes the @entity7 should always be the preferred provider			2
’ @entity231 health minister @entity231 said : ‘ @entity231 in government put an end to @entity2 's sweetheart deals with the private sector , while the independent @entity236 has poured cold water on @entity2 's claims about privatisation			1
‘ only the @entity231 have a credible plan to invest the £ 8bn per year by 2020 that @entity7 bosses say is needed			0
‘ a private sector profit cap sounds appealing but the devil would be in the detail and a simplistic policy could cause chaos for local hospitals			0
’ dr @entity248 , of the @entity249 , said @entity2 ’s plan ‘ does n’t go far enough ’ and an extra £ 2.5 billion ‘ wo n't stop the @entity7 from teetering over the cliff - edge ’			2
‘ the bottom line is that @entity2 's policies will leave the @entity7 under - resourced and open to continued privatisation , which will make it impossible to provide a comprehensive , high quality , efficient and safe health service , ’ she added			1
‘ a cap on private profits is unworkable			0
it 's easy for private companies to arrange their tax affairs so as to avoid registering profits			0
for example , @entity264 do not currently record a profit in the @entity267 on their @entity7 contracts			0
‘ @entity2 's commitments on the @entity7 are lukewarm and tinkering around the edges			2
