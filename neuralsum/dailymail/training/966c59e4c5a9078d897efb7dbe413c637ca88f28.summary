a mysterious ' crop circle ' that appeared in a @entity2 barley field a week ago has been explained : it was a publicity stunt for a tech company			1
@entity4 , a company that makes chips for computers and smart phones , owned up to the stunt at a press conference in @entity10 sunday			1
ceo @entity11 said he had given his marketing department a small budget and a mission to promote the company 's new @entity17 chip			1
the crop circle near @entity44 , @entity2 , contained a stylized image of a computer chip and the number ' 192 ' in @entity48			1
on sunday , the company announced the @entity17 , a new chip for tablets and smartphones that contains 192 computing ' cores , ' or mini-computers , for graphics applications			2
in the new @entity58 , the graphics component based on its " @entity61 " design , used in high - end pcs. the chip would makes for a tablet more powerful than an @entity64 or @entity65 game console , while consuming one - twentieth the power			0
' we 've bridged the gap - we 've brought mobile computing to the same level as desktop computing , ' @entity67 said			0
the 192 cores in the new chip compare to @entity4 's previous flagship , the @entity76 4 , with 72 graphics cores			2
@entity67 demonstrated near photo - realistic simulations of environments and human faces , run on the new chip			0
he said @entity81 will adapt the next version of its @entity83 , the basis for many popular games , so that it will work on the chip			0
he did n't announce when the chip would be available or any gadget makers that were adopting it			0
the giant markings caused believers to claim that aliens had landed in @entity93 , while crop circle experts were quick to claim that the shape , which resembles a computer chip , was a hoax			1
an anonymous video surfaced on @entity31 that claimed to show the first discovery of the circle , after two friends noticed flashing lights in a field and got out of their car to investigate			1
the first pictures of the markings were taken by photographer @entity107 of the 111th @entity108 who flew over the site near @entity44 , ten miles south of @entity93			2
@entity110 told @entity111 : ' it was beautiful			0
quite beautiful ... i believe it 's possible that aliens exist , but i do n't know if they would bother making a crop circle to give us a message			1
' the @entity31 video claimed to show two men finding the markings after they witnessed green flashing lights next to the road			1
the footage showed the men leaving their car and climbing over the fence into the field			0
while the green lights flickered few more times the cameraman focused on the flattened plants			2
at one point one of the friends said : ' dude , are you seeing this ? dude , this is a crop circle			1
' after walking in the field for a couple of minutes the men appeared the panic and run back to their vehicle			2
' a friend and i were driving on @entity146 south of @entity93 , @entity2 before sunrise , and this happened , ' the @entity31 user known only as can not say commented on the video			1
view from above : aerial photographer @entity107 shot the circle from a helicopter impressive sight : ' it was beautiful			0
quite beautiful , ' said the aerial photographer who shot the marking ' needless to say , pretty wild , but we slipped away and it 's too good not to share			0
created this account since i do n't want this tied to me			0
still not sure what to make of it			0
' many people were not convinced that the markings were proof of an alien visitation			0
the @entity166 reported that the site was being protected by security guards on monday , but they would not name the client they were working for			0
@entity170 of the @entity171 also told the paper that there were several signs that the circles were made by human rather than extra-terrestrial life			1
@entity170 pointed out that the marking was too well aligned with the road , the center of the circle resembled braille and that the @entity31 video could have been a form of viral marketing			1
' my guess is that ... it is commissioned work for an advertisement , ' @entity170 explained to the @entity166			0
' or a commissioned work for a production company making a documentary on crop circles or for some kind of film			2
' proof ? the @entity31 video concentrated on the flattened plants in the the field that make up the crop circle			1
