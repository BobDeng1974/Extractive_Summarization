on wednesday i 'm heading to @entity1 to watch @entity2 versus @entity3 after an invite from @entity2 boss @entity5			1
i got the invite out of the blue when i was n't working			2
it includes watching training and stay over			2
video : scroll down to watch @entity5 , @entity11 and @entity12 class act : @entity5 has shown humility by thinking of others during a busy time for @entity2 @entity17 hot ! @entity5 ' side are flying high in second place following the 6 - 3 destruction of @entity21 @entity22 : @entity23 and @entity24 ( r ) are the @entity26 's most potent partnership nice gesture : @entity5 and @entity28 ( r ) share humility and generosity as traits of a champion at the time i guess it was to keep me busy whilst i was , as they say , ' between jobs			1
' i think it shows great humility thinking of others like that , especially with his team flying high , with all the media demands and people no doubt requesting interviews and appearances left , right and centre			2
that sort of gesture reminds me of a few years ago at @entity51 when i did a bike ride to raise money to help pay the players ' wages			1
i personally wrote to all the @entity26 managers asking them to sponsor the 30 - mile journey from my house to the ground in west @entity60			1
a week after i had sent the letter i got a hand - written card in the post with a cheque inside for £ 500 from ' @entity28 and @entity65 ' wishing me the best of luck			1
the name on the bottom of the cheque was @entity28			1
he went on to win the league with @entity71 that season			2
the @entity73 : despite his success , sir @entity28 was always willing to help out other managers there is no question that @entity79 's players are technically gifted and supremely talented			1
but when they come up against the big boys who have power , strength and pace , they are so often beaten			0
@entity87 's performance to win 6 - 0 was an outstanding effort			2
unhappy anniversary ! @entity91 's 1000th game as @entity79 boss was one of the worst in his career hit for six ! @entity87 staked their claim to be @entity26 champions with a 6 - 0 victory at @entity98 a right kerfuffle : @entity100 was sent off , despite @entity101 being guilty of handball frontrunners : @entity87 moved seven points clear of @entity87 at the top of the @entity26 table after a commanding performance in the @entity109 in mid-week against @entity111 the win over @entity79 makes it loud and clear that @entity87 believe the title will be theirs			1
for @entity91 his magnificent 1,000th game turned into a living nightmare – especially to see his team capitulate in that manner			0
his invincible side of a decade ago not only played great football but they had warriors who performed with steel and gritty determination in every position on the pitch			0
when it comes to technique , @entity79 are better than the rest , but when it comes to the crunch , they can not beat the best			1
invincibles : @entity79 's current side are a pale shadow of the team that went through an entire season unbeaten what a shock			1
it has been revealed that back - handers were allegedly paid out to make sure the @entity141 would take place in @entity143 in 2022			0
vast sums of money have seemingly changed hands			0
back handers : vast sums of money were allegedly paid to bring the @entity141 to @entity143 it 's a breeze : air - conditioned stadiums have been suggested to combat the 120 degree heat no wonder			2
it must be the maddest decision in the history of football to stage a @entity141 there			2
to have football matches played in 120 degree heat , in the middle of june , to discuss playing in air - conditioned stadiums or moving it to the winter in a country when there is hardly anyone there in the first place			0
a massive stewards enquiry is needed to sort this mess out			0
there is surely no - way the competition can possibly go ahead there now			0
@entity172 must do something about it before we have what will be the worst @entity141 there has ever been			1
take action ! @entity172 must act to change the venue before this becomes the worst @entity141 in history i 'm delighted for my old team - mate @entity12 , whose job in charge at @entity184 is continually called into question – even by his own chief executive @entity186			1
there is no getting away from the fact his forward signings have not quite worked out this season			0
but @entity12 continues to carry himself with dignity and calm			1
he is controlled and measured whenever he is on tv or in front of reporters			0
it 's no surprise , when a manager acts in that manner , that his players are now finding wins that will see them escape relegation and finish comfortably in mid-table			1
what a huge result against relegation rivals @entity3 where his side dominated against a team who should have been fighting for their lives			0
then they had the composure to see the game out in the second half			0
@entity215 he always gives a confident interview and the man has got class			0
you could not wish to meet a nicer guy			0
i 'm sure the @entity184 will be singing cheerily come the end of the season			1
true gent : @entity184 boss @entity12 is one of the nicest managers in the @entity26 screamer : @entity228 sealed a 2 - 0 victory over @entity3 with a contender for goal of the season canaries singing : @entity184 players celebrate a win that brings them closer to survival this season late on tuesday night i watched the last episode of @entity239			1
i 've never watched anything like that online before , but being out of work and having plenty of time on my hands gave me a chance to watch the entire five series			0
when it finally finished late that night i took a deep breath and thought : ' that 's a shame i really enjoyed that			2
' box set : having time on his hands has given @entity254 a chance to watch all five series of @entity239 i started wondering what i was going to do afterwards			0
not again ! @entity254 's dog @entity258 is getting tired of constant walks i woke up on wednesday morning wondering how to pass the time that day , which had so often been filled with episodes of @entity239 during recent weeks and taking poor @entity258 , my dog , for a walk			1
most dogs will jump up and down with excitement when they hear they 're going for a walk , but now he flashes me a look as if to say : ' please not again			0
' but then , out of the blue , i got a call at 3pm that afternoon and was offered a contract at @entity273 until the end of the season			1
it all happened in a flash			0
i went in to the training ground the next morning to chat with the players , took training on friday and had a game on saturday			2
it 's like with any walk of life , you want to work			2
when you get sacked it 's a horrible feeling and you get very isolated and lonely			2
you have to move house and leave a large part of your life behind			0
the amount i 've moved about it feels like i 've been living in a caravan for the past five years			0
@entity273 had just lost four games in a row but the players did very well in windy and difficult conditions and we beat @entity298 two - nil			1
back in the fray : @entity254 ( c ) has returned as manager of @entity273 until the end of the season all you have to do is give the players some clarification in what they 're doing and some self - belief			1
promotion might be a stretch this season , but we 've got a very exciting chance to get into the play - offs and achieve some dreams .			0

@entity5 has asked me to visit @entity1 , despite @entity2 's busy *schedule*
@entity28 once sponsored me £ 500 to help pay @entity51 players ' wages
@entity79 's technically gifted players ca n't handle powerful *opposition*
@entity26 's nicest manager @entity12 *deserves* to stay up with @entity184
@entity172 need to act before @entity327 becomes the worst in history
a return to management with @entity273 will please my exhausted dog @entity258
