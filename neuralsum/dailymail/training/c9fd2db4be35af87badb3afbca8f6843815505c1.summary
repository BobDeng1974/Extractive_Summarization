@entity0 has released an official image of its new ' stealth ' ship - destroyer in a clear warning to both @entity4 and the @entity5 that is able to launch deadly attacks on their vessels without warning			1
state - run media said the high - speed cross between a catamaran and hovercraft was the result of a 10 - year project and would enable it to attack any naval vessels @entity0 considers to be a threat			2
the air - cushioned ships are equipped with a rigid , faceted hull , allowing it to efficiently bounce along the surface of the ocean while also limiting its radar presence - making it incredibly difficult for target vessels to detect the ship - destroyer before it launches its deadly sea - skimming missiles			1
in terms of firepower , the ship - destroyer is thought to boast powerful @entity53 - made sea - skimming missiles called the @entity54 , versions of which have a range of 135 nautical miles and have been compared with the @entity59 's @entity58 missile			1
@entity0 did not reveal detail of the maximum range of its @entity54 missiles , though it did claim that during testing a ship - destroyer hit and sunk a target ship from more than 60 miles away			2
for closer combat the ship - destroyer is fitted with two @entity0 @entity69 30mm gatling guns , four machine gun turrets and an anti-aircraft missile system , according to @entity72			1
the ship - destroyer is the latest in a long line of hovercraft - type ship to be developed by the @entity48 and there understood to be at least two more such vessels still in development			2
details of the ship - destroyer came as the @entity4 navy carried out joint exercises with the @entity5 military details of @entity0 's new ship - destroyer came just two days after it test - fired five short - range missiles into the sea and after @entity4 navy performed joint exercises with the @entity5 details of @entity0 's new ship - destroyer came just two days after it test - fired five short - range missiles into the sea - the second such weapons test conducted by @entity90 this year - amid dimming prospects for the resumption of high - level talks between with its rival @entity4			1
the missiles , fired from a @entity0 coastal town , flew about 125 miles before landing in waters off the country 's east coast , a @entity96 official said on condition of anonymity , citing department rules			0
@entity0 routinely tests missiles , rockets and artillery , but the latest launches came with the two koreas at odds over terms for a possible summit meeting between their leaders			0
the two countries last month floated the idea of the summit , which would be the third such meeting since they were divided 70 years ago			0
last year , the @entity48 conducted an unusually large number of missile and other weapons tests , drawing protests from @entity4			0
the @entity48 still proposed a set of measures that it said would lower tensions , but @entity4 rebuffed them , saying the country must first take steps toward nuclear disarmament			0
the @entity129 remains in a technical state of war because the 1950 - 53 @entity131 ended with an armistice , not a peace treaty .			0

@entity90 said high speed ship - destroyer project was 10 years in making
result is a high - speed hovercraft packed with sea - skimming missiles
the ship - destroyer can target enemy vessels stationed 100 miles away
also boasts machine gun turrets , anti-aircraft missile launchers and a faceted hull , making it incredibly difficult to detect on radar
