by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity1 is the new sweetheart of @entity2 , and with the biggest names in the women ’s game falling quicker than sales of @entity6 outside @entity8 station , she is taking centre stage			1
the @entity10 swats away opponents with a firecracker forehand on the court and charms away from the lawns with a ready wit on subjects ranging from the @entity18 to what makes her blood boil			1
the two collided on wednesday when she was forced to wait for the @entity23 and @entity24 before taking apart quarter - final opponent @entity25			1
match point : @entity1 beat @entity25 in straight sets on wednesday up and coming : she is into her third successive semi-final at a @entity29 royal appointment : @entity1 revealed how players were made to wait for @entity32 to take their seats love match : @entity35 and @entity24 , the @entity23 and @entity24 , enjoyed watching play on @entity37 @entity39 ” @entity38 ’ 6 ” 9st8lbs @entity40 turned @entity41 wins 25084 @entity42 7 £ 1.4m			1
prize money £ 3msaviano coach @entity44 - to - head 1 ‘ when we walked out of the members ’ locker room five minutes before we were due to start , all these security guards rushed over to us and were , like , “ nobody move , move your bags to the side , there ’s some @entity32 coming through ”			1
so we were just waiting , and then suddenly @entity35 and @entity24 walk by to go on @entity37 , ’ she recounted			2
‘ it was funny because we actually walked to our court late because @entity24 and @entity35 used that hallway			2
it ’s funny how @entity8 does it			2
waiting for people usually makes me angry as i ’m an impatient person — particularly when i ’m waiting for family members for dinner — but i was ok to wait that one time			0
’ there are not many people to whom @entity1 is happy to play second fiddle , as @entity25 soon discovered			1
with their blonde hair in neat plaits and both wearing matching white visors , it was as though they had co-ordinated their outfits			0
but when it came down to business , @entity1 smashed her mirror image , leaping on to the @entity78 ’s woefully weak second serve and putting away overhead volleys like a prize fighter delivering a knockout punch			2
on form : the @entity10 celebreates taking the first set on day nine at @entity2 @entity85 blow : @entity25 fights hard but is eventually broken in the first set the 20 - year - old @entity10 is no flash in the pan			1
her relatively straightforward 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 victory over @entity25 , no 9 in the world and a former semi-finalist here , takes her into the top 10 for the first time			1
@entity1 is the only player to reach the semi-finals of all three @entity29 this year and no 3 seed @entity97 today stands in the way of a spot in saturday ’s final			1
they are the two most consistent players on the women ’s tour with 15 wins at this year ’s majors			2
@entity97 crushed @entity105 , last year ’s beaten finalist , 6 - 4 , 6 - 0 on @entity37 , partly owing to the @entity78 ’s incredible implosion			1
@entity105 fell apart from 4 - 1 up in the first set , losing 11 games in a row			1
@entity97 smelt blood and ripped her to shreds			2
@entity1 has fallen at this hurdle in the @entity113 and @entity112 but is determined to go further this time			2
as evidence of her determination , she has eschewed sightseeing trips with her mother @entity117 and brother @entity35			0
‘ i do n’t want to waste energy and get distracted , ’ she said			0
‘ my mum and brother have gone visiting quite a bit			0
they went to @entity122 , the @entity123 , all these things , while i ’m practising or playing matches			0
maybe i ’ll do that after the tournament or next year			0
it ’s something i do when i lose early , so i hope to not do it at all			0
’ @entity1 was named after @entity129 , and her twin sister , who was named after @entity131 , attends university in @entity10			1
‘ she is my own princess @entity131 , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ we are opposite but very close			0
it ’s interesting , because i think her normal university life is really cool because i do n’t do it and i ’m a huge supporter of her			0
i get on her about her grades and things like that			0
’ power : @entity1 strikes through the ball in the first match on @entity146 1 on wednesday a tv view : genie serves in the distance of a ball girl on wednesday afternoon if @entity1 was being assessed at @entity8 , she would be getting straight @entity152 so far			1
while her one - time idol @entity153 and world no 1 @entity155 have fallen by the wayside , @entity1 is yet to drop a set			1
just two years ago she was winning the junior girls ’ title here and this is only her sixth @entity29 , but it is indicative of her self - belief that she is not really surprised at her surge up the rankings			1
‘ i felt last year that i belonged here so i do n’t think it is surprising , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’ve played for 15 years now			0
i ’ve put in a lot of hard work			0
so , results that come for me , in the back of my mind i expected them because i ’ve put in so much time and effort			0
‘ i decided i was going to be a professional player at nine years old and the more i played i really had concrete dreams of winning a @entity29			0
’ @entity1 quickly dismissed a light - hearted suggestion that she might follow @entity177 in switching allegiance from @entity10 to @entity179 , but the flag sellers outside the station might consider stocking more @entity183 flags for the remainder of the tournament .			1

@entity1 wins 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 on @entity146 1 at @entity8 on wednesday
@entity10 will play @entity97 in the semi-finals
she is just 20 , but has reached three successive @entity29 last fours
@entity193 reveals how players were forced top wait for @entity23 and @entity24 to take their places
