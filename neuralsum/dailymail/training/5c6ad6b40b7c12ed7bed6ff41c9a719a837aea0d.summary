mr @entity0 died from his injuries a few days later in hospital			2
' the motive had been robbery			2
the defendant stole a few hundred pounds while his grandfather was lying on the floor unable to move			1
' carers alerted the pensioner ’s son , @entity38 - who is @entity9 's uncle - and he rushed to his father ’s sheltered housing flat in @entity42			1
mr @entity0 discovered the flat door slightly ajar , signs of a disturbance with the coffee table knocked over and his elderly father on the floor of the lounge			2
the pensioner asked his son to call the police and then told him what had happened			2
' he said @entity9 had come to the flat saying that he had just finished work , ' mr @entity54 said			1
' he had then attacked his grandfather , grabbing him around the neck			1
@entity0 thought the defendant had been trying to break his neck			2
' he had one arm around the front of his neck and one arm around the back			2
he was terrified to move because his neck was painful			0
' mr @entity54 said that @entity65 dialled 999 and asked for the police and an ambulance			0
the operator spoke to his father , who told them : ' my grandson came in , i do n’t know for what reason			0
he came in and attacked me			0
passed away : mr @entity0 died in hospital in @entity75 from pneumonia related to his injuries a few days after the alleged attack ' he was twisting my neck and that			0

a post-mortem examination found he had died from pneumonia caused by the injuries he suffered			0
' the injuries were of a kind seen in those who died as a result of neck compression , ' mr @entity54 said			0
' to cause those injuries took force - force that was quite deliberately applied			0
no - one could apply force of that severity to a man of any age without intending to cause really serious harm			0
' to use force of that kind against a man of mr @entity0 ’s age - in his physical condition - invites one conclusion only , the prosecution say , that the defendant intended to cause really serious harm			0
