as many of us prepare to head abroad for summer holidays , many will be lamenting not starting their bikini diet months ago			1
but if the prospect of stripping off on the beach leaves you in a cold sweat help is at hand			1
@entity10 , 23 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , has become an internet sensation with her bikini body guide earning her an astonishing one million @entity16 followers , including @entity19 angel @entity17			1
speaking with @entity49 , @entity10 shares her personalized workouts and meal plan that can help you slim down fast in time for your holiday			1
however she does n’t advise crash dieting , which can ultimately lead you to pile the weight back on			1
‘ girls so often fluctuate between taking their health seriously and not doing anything at all			1
with a body that would not look out of place on a catwalk , @entity10 seems to have mastered the equation needed for an ultra slim and lean physique ‘ nothing is worse for your body than constantly putting it through changes like this			1
this frequently is the cause of bloating , rapid weight gain or weight loss , emotional eating and disappointment			1
so find a simple plan and stick to it ! @entity77 is vital			1
even if you do n’t necessarily feel like it ! having a good serve of protein , carbs and fats in the morning is the best way for you to start the day ! you will have lots more energy to keep you going until lunch time			2
try to eat three main meals and two small snacks a day			2
i recommend spacing out your meals 2 - 3 hours in between each other for convenience			1
i always make sure i leave the house with two nutritious snacks			2
almonds and grapes are my favourite as they are easy to carry in my bag and eat on the go ! 3			2
although you might feel like you are eating enough nutritious food everyday , our bodies can sometimes still lack vitamins			2
i take a multivitamin every morning to help boost my immune system ! 4			2
do n’t be a afraid of carbs ! carbs are key for maximum energy , stamina , concentration , recovery and better fluid balance			2
they are so important for people who are working out regularly because they are the primary fuel for your body			1
your brain is almost entirely fueled by carbohydrates , so its pretty important you eat them			2
think of carbohydrates as the gas needed to fuel a car			2
without gas , a car wo n't run			2
likewise , without carbohydrates , your body will not have the fuel it requires to run through an entire day			1
carbs are an essential part of your diet , just do n’t eat too many			2
@entity10 ’s pre-holiday workout consists of targeted circuits which aim to work on specific ‘ problem ’ areas of the body while also burning calories			1
her diet plan aims to give you plenty of energy for her intense workouts , while reducing fat and calories to help you slim down			1
and when it comes to food when you get to your destination , @entity10 advises avoiding the traditional holiday binges			1
‘ i just returned from my first ever trip to @entity151 actually and my biggest piece of advice would definitely be to find a really good restaurant or café , that has healthy , cheap meals , and keep going back			2
there are so many places that both overcharge and provide some really bad versions of simple dishes			2
find your favorite place / s for breakfast , lunch or dinner and keep using it			0
‘ as far as choosing what foods to eat , it ’s pretty simple really			0
do your best to follow your normal day at home			0
anywhere in the world will have “ similar ” foods available for each meal			1
it ’s just a matter of tailoring the slightly different options to suit your needs			0
’ on the beach , well tailored swimwear is essential to looking trim			0
‘ wear a bikini that actually fits , especially around your bust			0
there is nothing worse than a bikini that is too big or too small			0
if you need help , take a friend shopping with you and get them to adjust sizes , as you need			0
‘ if you ’ve got it , flaunt it ! wear a bikini to accentuate your beautiful body shape			1
