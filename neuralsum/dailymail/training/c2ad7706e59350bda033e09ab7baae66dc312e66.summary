@entity23 , founder of the sanctuary , said : ' when orchid was originally found she was laying on the floor , emaciated and full of sores and had given up			1
' to see her today running , bucking and rolling is so heart - warming			2
' she 's almost totally blind but it does n't seem to bother her too much			0
she 's a very happy horse nowadays , full of energy and has a great attitude			2
' @entity21 knows her own mind which is great to see for a horse of her age			2

' when i first set up this sanctuary 31 years ago , 15 was a good age for a horse but now it 's normal for them to live to the age of 30			1
