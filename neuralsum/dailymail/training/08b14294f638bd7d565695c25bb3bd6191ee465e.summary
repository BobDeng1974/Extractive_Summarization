@entity1 has had one demand every seven seconds to suppress information about people ’s pasts , it was revealed today			1
the rush of censorship requests follows the internet giant ’s move to provide forms allowing people to ask that certain information about them be hidden when their name is searched online			2
the figures indicate that large amounts of material could disappear from public reach as a direct result of an @entity20 court decision that search engines must enforce a ‘ right to be forgotten ’			1
scroll down to see video requests : managers at the search engine said the online form was used 12,000 times on friday - the first day it was available			1
@entity1 's @entity31 headquarters in @entity32 are pictured managers at the search engine said the online form was used 12,000 times on friday – the first day it was available – with applications arriving at the rate of 20 a minute during its busiest periods			1
demands came from all 28 @entity20 countries , but are understood to involve hundreds from @entity31			0
the flood of requests follows last month ’s ruling at the @entity20 ’s @entity44 in @entity45 that people have a right to ask for ‘ inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant , or excessive ’ material about them to be dropped from search results			2
however one internet pioneer , @entity53 founder @entity52 , said today that the @entity55 attempt to suppress information would not work because of the global scale of the web			1
he told the @entity61 ’s @entity60 show : ‘ they do n’t censor the @entity64 version			0
that is not going to happen			0
there are many search engines around the world which do n’t have a presence in @entity55 and who wo n’t abide by this ruling			2
’ although @entity1 is based in @entity73 , judges ruled that it could be considered a @entity55 organisation because it maintains sales offices in @entity55 countries			0
internet pioneer : @entity53 founder @entity52 said that the @entity55 attempt to suppress information would not work because of the global scale of the web a high proportion of the information expected be lost to @entity55 search engine users is likely to be connected to convicted criminals trying to remove records of their past that could be seen by employers , clients or social contacts			1
over the first three days following the court judgement , those asking for records to be removed in @entity31 included a convicted user of child pornography , a politician with a chequered record in office , and a doctor with a controversial professional record			0
' there are many search engines around the world which do n’t have a presence in @entity55 and who wo n’t abide by this ruling ' @entity52 , @entity53 founder the ruling was triggered by a test case involving a @entity107 citizen who wanted @entity1 to stop providing an embarrassing link in searches for his name			1
the link provided a regional newspaper advert from 1998 , in which authorities were auctioning the man ’s house to recoup debts to the social security system			0
judges said search engines should be required on request to remove links which breached the ‘ right to be forgotten ’ – a new rule strongly supported by officials in @entity125 but one which has yet to be incorporated into @entity20 treaty law			1
the scope of the rule – against which there is no appeal – is not yet clear			0
the @entity61 , which runs an archive of news stories dating back to the 1990s , is also among organisations to receive requests that material cease to be flagged up			0
information not shown in internet search results is effectively beyond the reach of web users who do not know the specific location of what they are looking for .			2

people can ask that certain information about them be hidden on @entity1
@entity20 court decision said search engines must enforce ' right to be forgotten '
