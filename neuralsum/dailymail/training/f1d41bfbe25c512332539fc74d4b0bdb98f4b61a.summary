by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 1 june 2012 updated : 12:01 est , 1 june 2012 scientists have revealed the eight biggest unanswered questions surrounding our universe			1
they range from the mystery of dark matter , which makes up 73 % of everything but has never been identified , to questions over why our @entity9 is so hot			1
formulated by the prestigious journal @entity14 , have all been raised by the leading scientists in their field , each of whom also wrote an essay on the topic			1
most scientists agree that around three - quarters of the universe is missing - in the form of dark matter and dark energy , neither of which we have ever directly detected			1
this @entity27 ' map ' of dark matter is basically a guess an image of the sun taken by @entity31 's orbiting @entity32 - but scientists still do n't understand why the sun 's corona is so hot however , is some cases even the scientists admit some mysteries are unlikely to ever be solved			1
‘ each mystery is sure to be solved largely through astronomical observations — if it is solved : in at least one case , experts are n't sure that a seemingly simple question will ever be answered , ’ @entity39 of the journal explained			0
the biggest mystery is that of dark matter , which scientists admit may never be solved			1
‘ part of the mystery is that we have no clue whether we will be able to ﬁnd an answer , ’ says @entity49 , an astrophysicist at the @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 huge parts of the history of the universe remain a complete mystery to us : for a few hundred thousand years after the @entity63 , electrons were stripped from atoms - we have no idea why @entity66 , which appears to make up 73 % of everything that exists , and still it ca n’t be seen , or even measured			2
the energy is ' needed ' to balance out the mathematics of the universe , but may not ever be able to be detected			0
@entity71 , which is closely linked to @entity66 , is the term used to describe the ‘ glue ’ which holds everything in the universe together			0
however , @entity75 , who wrote @entity14 ’s essay on the subject , believes that unlike dark energy , scientists stand a reasonably good chance of one day actually detecting a particle of the stuff			2
where are the missing baryons ? baryons are particles that make unormal matter , but for some reason when adding up dark energy , dark matter and then leaving the rest to baryons , researchers ca n’t come up with a number that equals 100 % - hence the mystery why do stars explode ? many of the processes of star formation and solar system formation are known - but researchers admit they still do n’t really understand what goes on in a star when it explodes , forming what is known as a supernova			2
what re-ionized the universe ? for a few hundred thousand years after the @entity63 , electrons were stripped from atoms - we have no idea why			0
what is the source of the most energetic cosmic rays ? we ’re bombarded with them every day , yet researchers ca n’t agree on where they come from			0
our atmosphere shields us from most of the rays			0
why is our solar system so odd ? did our solar system form the way it did by following logical steps , or was it all just chaos and chance ? nobody really knows			0
why is the sun 's corona so hot ? those that study the sun still really do n’t know			0
the corona is the furthest layer from the sun 's core , but it 's still incredibly hot - and the reasons for this strange ' layering ' of our nearest star are still a mystery .			1

eight mysteries chosen by @entity14
scientists admit some ' may never be solved '
three - quarters of the universe is ' missing ' according to *current* *theories*
@entity9 's outer layer is ' too hot ' - and no one knows why
