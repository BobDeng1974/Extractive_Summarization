the @entity0 opened their @entity2 campaign in emphatic fashion by posting a bonus point 42 - 7 victory over outclassed @entity7 visitors @entity8			1
@entity11 fly - half @entity9 ran the show , kicking 17 points and orchestrating @entity0 ' best attacking moments as full - back @entity15 touched down twice , while wing @entity17 , scrum - half @entity19 and number eight @entity21 also scored tries			1
@entity8 wing @entity24 scored a late consolation try , converted by former @entity29 and @entity30 fly - half @entity27 , but there was little for the @entity32 to cheer on another dismal @entity34 occasion for them			2
@entity15 scores his second , and @entity38 's fifth , try of the match in what was a routine win over @entity8 it meant the unbeaten @entity44 leaders took early charge of @entity46 , teeing up nicely next saturday 's clash against reigning @entity49 champions @entity48 at @entity50			0
saints will start as favourites - they beat @entity0 twice in last season 's @entity53 - but @entity9 and company can head to the @entity56 confident of making an impression			0
the only worrying note on an otherwise routine afternoon was @entity11 autumn squad hopeful @entity21 being carried off midway through the second period after suffering what appeared to be a neck injury			0
there was a 10 - minute stoppage while @entity21 received attention from medics			0
@entity9 ran the show , kicking 17 points and orchestrating @entity0 ' best attacking moments @entity8 , back in @entity71 little more than a month after they suffered a 44 - 13 @entity44 defeat against the @entity0 , were soon under pressure when @entity9 sparked a brilliant counter-attack from deep inside home territory			1
and although @entity8 halted that move , two successful @entity9 penalties during the opening eight minutes hinted at a long shift to come for the lowest - ranked team in this season 's competition			1
there was a fluency about @entity0 ' play and after @entity9 completed his penalty hat - trick inside 13 minutes , their opening try arrived shortly afterwards following strong set - piece play , slick handling and a neat @entity9 pass than sent @entity17 over			2
@entity9 added the conversion , and @entity0 were well on their way to a potential bonus - point victory , leading 16 - 0 early in the second quarter of a one - sided encounter			0
@entity21 was carried off midway through the second period after suffering what appeared to be a neck injury @entity8 's cause was not helped by the loss through injury of captain @entity102 , and they were then temporarily reduced to 14 players when @entity102 's replacement @entity106 was sin - binned by @entity108 referee @entity107 for pulling down a maul deep inside his team 's 22			2
@entity0 then kept up the pressure , and @entity19 sniped his way over for a sixth try in seven starts this term - form that suggests he will strongly challenge @entity116 to wear the @entity11 number nine shirt against opening autumn test series opponents @entity119 on november 8 - and @entity9 's conversion made it 23 - 0			2
the @entity0 forwards looked to maintain their grip in the second period , and their dominance led to a further @entity8 indiscretion that saw substitute prop @entity127 yellow - carded , which as with @entity106 's caution cost the visitors dear			0
@entity130 of @entity0 is tackled by @entity8 's @entity32 no 8 @entity131 within a minute of @entity127 's exit , the @entity0 struck for their third try when @entity15 grounded possession underneath a pile of bodies , and @entity9 's conversion left @entity8 30 points adrift with more than 30 minutes remaining			1
the bonus - point try arrived with just 54 minutes gone as @entity8 's defence found itself scattered to all parts , enabling @entity21 to enjoy an unopposed run - in before @entity9 maintained his 100 per cent success rate by landing a seventh successful kick from seven attempts			1
@entity21 's injury did not noticeably disrupt the @entity0 ' rhythm , and their fifth try arrived 17 minutes from time following a sharp break and a superbly - timed scoring pass by the impressive @entity19 to an unmarked @entity15			1
@entity8 showed plenty of commitment and desire , despite the scoreline , but their technical , tactical and skill limitations mean it will be a major surprise if they win a @entity34 game this season , especially as their other pool opponents are @entity48 and @entity159			0
with the game long done as a contest , @entity0 head coach @entity161 had all eight of his substitutes on well before the end , including @entity11 internationals @entity130 , @entity166 and @entity167 , but he knows the @entity34 campaign is about to crank up considerably as @entity48 lie in wait .			0

*ospreys* beat @entity8 42 - 7 in their @entity2 opener
@entity9 kicked 17 points and played well throughout
@entity15 , @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity21 all scored tries
