@entity0 has admitted he would have stayed with @entity1 had he been offered a contract last summer			1
@entity0 ’s decision to quit @entity4 sent shockwaves through football and he revealed he had turned down offers from clubs in the @entity9 , @entity10 and the @entity11			1
most significantly , though , @entity0 revealed he would have committed his future to @entity1 had they offered to extend his terms when he retired from @entity15			1
he intended to commit to @entity1 for the next ‘ two or three years ’ but an offer did not arrive until november			1
‘ i ’d just retired from @entity15 to concentrate on @entity1			1
i did n't want my club games to be tailored			2
' my injury record had been fantastic for the past two - and - a - half years and i had a great season from a personal point of view last season			1
' it 's all ifs , buts and hindsight now			2
that period between the summer and the end of november gave me thinking time			1
' there 's no blame and i 'm not angry about it			2
there are other people in the squad and the club had other things to worry about			2
' there is no finger pointing from me towards the manager or anyone else at the club			2
' @entity0 is expected to sign for @entity56 side @entity55 in the very near future @entity1 manager @entity58 and @entity59 arrive for the party with their partners @entity63 full back @entity62 poses for a photo with his partner on tuesday evening @entity0 ( left ) wheels away after heading in the opening goal of the game against @entity23 @entity58 spoke to @entity0 , who is expected to sign a deal with @entity56 side @entity55 in the near future , in late november and it came as something of a surprise to the player , but once the writing was on the wall the former @entity15 captain knew his days at @entity4 were numbered			1
' i 've got to be honest , that chat with @entity58 came earlier than i was expecting , ' he added			0
' it was about a month before that he first mentioned to me about managing my game time			1
' we had another chat on the subject recently - 10 days to two weeks ago			1
it was tough but i understood			0
it 's been very amicable			0
everyone knows how much i rate @entity58			0
our relationship is very good			0
' there has n't been a cross word between us			0
@entity58 has been fantastic for me			0
my only regret is that i did n't get to work with him at a younger age			0
@entity0 looks on as his fine free - kick goes over the wall on its way to securing @entity1 a 2 - 1 victory @entity0 reiterated his respect for manager @entity58 and said nobody was to blame for his exit @entity101 believes the midfielder ( centre ) would be earning rave reviews if he was 10 years younger ' since i was 16 , 17 years of age , the moment i come into work on a monday morning my preparations begin to play 90 minutes the following weekend			1
' that 's the buzz			0
i 've always worked hard all week to prepare and make sure my performance is right come the weekend			0
' when it gets to the stage where you do n't know if you 're going to be starting or not it becomes different			0
' i 've never wanted to be a squad player			0
if i was missing games now , i 'd be sitting out even more next season			1
i knew it would get worse and worse as time went on			2

@entity0 will leave @entity1 for the @entity56 at the end of the season
the captain has admitted he would have signed a new deal in the summer
@entity1 did not offer the *34* - year - old and it left him with ' thinking time '
