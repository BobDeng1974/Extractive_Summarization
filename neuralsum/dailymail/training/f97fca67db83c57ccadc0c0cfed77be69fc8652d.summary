by @entity1 reporter published : 06:39 est , 16 february 2013 updated : 06:58 est , 16 february 2013 a council has defended its decision to sell the birthplace of former prime minister sir @entity5 for a bargain price			2
@entity7 , set in 25 acres of parkland and boasting its own clock tower , stables and servants ’ quarters , was expected to attract offers of more than £ 2million			1
but six years after it first went on the market it has been sold for £ 241,000 - a fraction of its original valuation			1
piece of history : @entity7 is thought to have been valued at nearly £ 2million just a few years ago sign of distinction : the 19th - century clocktower would have been in place when former prime minister @entity5 was born here deserted for years : the house has not been used since 2003 , when a local authority school moved out because it needed major repairs elegant decor : one of several ornate ceilings within the beautiful building in 2010 , @entity31 refused the proposals by a developer who wanted to build luxury homes on the site opulent fashion : classical mouldings shaped like swirling leaves and baskets of flowers decorate walls and ceilings throughout the mansion the grade - ii listed property , sold by the @entity46 family in the 1920s , was once a school and a former pow camp during the war , but had been empty since 2006			1
@entity51 , head of assets at @entity53 , said : ' given the condition of the building the state of the market and the very significant maintenance costs ...			2
the sale did represent best value for money for taxpayers			1
' a councillor had reported the sale to the @entity65 whose investigation highlighted a lack of transparency in selling the property after a £ 1.5 million deal collapsed			1
its new owners , who have chosen to remain anonymous , vowed : ‘ it is a private home which is going to be renovated back to its original splendour			2
’ the charming house features grand staircases , doric order columns and 12 bay windows at the front generations of happy families : @entity83 as viewed from the former pleasure gardens with the clocktower in the background the @entity83 has a billiard room , a library with a dummy bookcase leading to its gallery and a drawing room affluent past : staff quarters and a stable are situated in the extensive grounds born at the hall : @entity5 was born at @entity97 in 1897 , before going on to become conservative prime minister in the fifties the picturesque home , located near the @entity102 village of @entity103 , is said to need urgent repairs costing an estimated £ 3million county councillor @entity105 insisted the council had sold the property too cheaply			1
he said : ‘ the property was on the market for a figure approaching £ 2million in 2007			1
‘ the council was offered £ 1.5million in the same year , but they turned this offer down			1
it is a massive , massive property , with ornate period features			0
‘ even in today ’s climate the land itself should be worth at least £ 4,000 an acre making the parkland alone worth £ 100,000			1
i think the sale for this price is totally wrong			2
’ the 19th century hall was first built in 1835 , incorporating a section of the rear wing which dated back to 1750			0
designed by architect @entity125 and built for @entity126 , the property was the 1897 birthplace of the former @entity130 prime minister sir @entity5 who led the country between 1955 and 1957			0
in 2006 @entity133 , faced with an £ 81,000 annual bill to maintain the hall , decided to sell up to a property developer who planned to turn the hall into luxury flats			2
' as the hall is a grade ii listed building , we were obliged by law to protect and maintain it while it was under our ownership			0
however , the proposals were rejected by @entity31			0
gorgeous setting : @entity97 lies within 25 acres of lush parkland grand interior : the hall boasts a library with dummy bookshelf , many original staircases and fireplaces - but needs major repairs upstairs downstairs : the northern elevation of the former staff accommodation glorious countryside : an earlier prospective buyer wanted to build luxury flats on the site - but the new owners intend to restore the home to its former splendour enduring designs : map showing the listed buildings in and around the 19th - century home after the deal fell through the council began looking at alternative options when it received an expression of interest which finally led to its sale			1
the @entity173 home has a billiard room , a library with a dummy bookcase leading to its gallery , stables , separate staff quarters and many original marble fireplaces			1
a spokesman for @entity31 said it was of the ‘ most historically significant buildings in the @entity184 ’ , adding : ‘ we are pleased new owners have been found and look forward to working with them and the council			0
’ from @entity189 to blackboards : an extension was added on to @entity97 when parts of it became a school between 1957 and 2003 @entity7 was built in 1835 and instantly became one of the region 's grandest stately homes			0
it was commissioned by @entity189 @entity198 , to replace his 16th - century manor , and designed by architect @entity125			2
on the death of the fifth @entity189 in 1844 , the estate and @entity189 passed to his cousin , sir @entity202 , the fourth @entity46 , who became high sheriff of @entity102 in 1848			0
@entity5 was born there in 1897 and later served as a cabinet minister before becoming prime minister from 1955 to 1957			0
the estate was then used as a prisoner of war camp for female @entity210 prisoners during the @entity211			1
afterwards it was adapted by the council to serve as a school for youngsters with emotional and behavioural difficulties for nearly 50 years , between 1957 and 2006			0
@entity217 added an unlisted extension to the building in the seventies , but was forced to relocate several years ago after the hall fell into disrepair			0
a buyer then became interested in developing the land for luxury flats , but the deal fell through and the house has only now been sold to an unnamed buyer , who plans to restore it to its former splendour .			0

the 25 - acre grounds contain stables , a clock tower and staff quarters and was expected to attract offers of more than £ 2 million
' the sale did represent the best value for money for taxpayers '
it was used as a pow camp during @entity211
