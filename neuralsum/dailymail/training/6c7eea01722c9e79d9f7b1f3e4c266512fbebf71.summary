try finding @entity1 's top goals on @entity2 and you 'll understand how many there are			1
with so many to choose from , it 's difficult to pinpoint just 10 after a decade of watching the @entity7 master at work			2
but we 've done it and here , @entity11 presents 10 of @entity1 's best - ever goals from his career at the @entity14			1
@entity1 scores against @entity16 in september and @entity11 picks out the @entity7 forward 's top goals the ' @entity20 ' goal ( against @entity21 , 2007 ) in 1986 , a newspaper posed a question to @entity20 after he single - handedly cut through the @entity25 team to score one of the greatest - ever goals : ' what planet did you come from ? ' after @entity1 's similar goal in 2007 against @entity21 , the question was repeated			1
starting in his own half and taking on five players , including the goalkeeper , @entity1 scored a goal that deserves a place on the mantelpiece as @entity7 beat @entity21 5 - 2 in the @entity39 semi-final			1
@entity1 scores one of his greatest - ever goals against @entity21 after taking on five players from his own half that header ( against @entity44 , 2009 ) sir @entity45 's @entity44 learned the hard way that , despite his height , you ca n't leave @entity1 unmarked in the box when the ball 's in the air			1
meeting a looping cross by @entity54 in the @entity56 final , 5ft 6½in @entity1 headed the ball beyond 6ft 5½in goalkeeper @entity58 from the most awkward of angles to complete the 2 - 0 victory			2
@entity1 met @entity54 's cross to kill off the @entity56 final against @entity44 in 2009 @entity1 proved he could be just as deadly with his head as he is with his feet for @entity7 in the 2009 final @entity1 ( left ) and @entity7 midfielder @entity66 celebrate with the @entity56 trophy after the win sheer power ( against @entity70 , 2010 ) @entity70 were leading 1 - 0 at the @entity14 , thanks to a @entity73 goal in the 19th minute			1
@entity7 needed inspiring and @entity1 , with four goals , did just that in this @entity56 tie			1
it was the forward 's equaliser that arguably stole the show when a fortunate one - two with @entity70 defender @entity79 allowed @entity1 to put his laces through the ball			2
keeper @entity82 could do nothing			0
@entity7 needed inspiring and @entity1 , with four goals , did just that in this @entity56 showdown on the chest ( against @entity86 , 2009 ) a fiercely - whipped cross found @entity1 who , instead of ducking to use his head , opted to go for the chest against @entity86 in 2009			1
it proved just as clinical as the ball sailed into the far - right corner beyond goalkeeper @entity94 and won @entity7 the @entity96 final in 2009			0
@entity7 's @entity1 opted to use his chest to win the @entity96 final in 2009 against @entity86 the flick ( against @entity99 , 2013 ) the most nonchalant goal you 'll ever see			1
technique , a cool head , pace , it had the lot			0
the @entity7 star starts with the ball outside the box and , after a one - two down the right - hand side , @entity1 cheekily flicks the ball over onrushing goalkeeper @entity112			2
the nutmeg ( against @entity114 , 2012 ) @entity1 loves a nutmeg almost as much as he loves a chip			0
against @entity114 in 2012 , he opted for both			0
the @entity7 forward was fed the ball on the edge of the box			0
he left @entity122 for dead , sliding the ball through the defender 's legs , before sublimely chipping goalkeeper @entity126			0
@entity1 nutmegged @entity122 first before chipping goalkeeper @entity126 to score for @entity7 @entity1 's 10 years since making his @entity7 debut has been fantastic with plenty of records broken the dancer ( against @entity131 , 2010 ) @entity131 thought rugby tackling @entity1 might stop the forward			1
they soon found out that was wrong			0
as part of a hat - trick , @entity1 shakes off rough defending in the middle of @entity131 's half before running at the back - line , turning those up against him inside out			2
he takes on four men - one of them twice , who is left in a spin - before drilling a low shot beyond goalkeeper @entity143			0
' a one - man show , ' the commentator says afterwards			0
@entity1 celebrates scoring against @entity131 in 2010 - one of the @entity7 forward 's many great goals @entity131 thought rugby tackling @entity1 might stop the forward but found it did n't work the off - guard ( against @entity151 , 2012 ) catching the goalkeeper off guard while he 's organising his wall is n't always as easy as it looks , particularly from this angle against then - @entity151 's @entity157			1
positioned on the left of the 18 - yard box , @entity1 's curled shot somehow dips and lands in the far - right corner of the net			1
afterwards , the commentator labels him a ' ball whisperer '			0
new @entity44 striker @entity166 ( left ) during the 2012 match against @entity1 's @entity7 the trickster ( against @entity70 , 2011 ) unfortunately for @entity70 , @entity1 seems to have a knack for scoring sensational goals against them			1
the @entity7 star finds himself through and @entity82 narrows @entity1 's options by rushing forward , only for the @entity174 to flick the ball over the goalkeeper before tapping it into the net			1
whether he could do this on a cold , wet , windy monday night at @entity180 is another matter			0
@entity1 celebrates while @entity70 goalkeeper @entity82 and defender @entity182 looks dejected a @entity183 ( against @entity184 , 2011 ) there can be no better game for @entity1 to exhibit his skills than in @entity188			0
