the research arm of the @entity1 announced a technological breakthrough thursday , releasing footage that shows successful tests of self - guided .50 caliber bullets , claimed to be the first of its kind			1
according to a news release by the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , the @entity11 ( @entity12 ) program recently conducted it 's first successful live test of the bullets			0
the video released by the agency shows a live test - fire of the bullet , which was shot at a path pointed away from its intended target			1
in the more recent firing of the bullet , dated april 21 , 2014 , it is shown curving back towards its target , hitting the mark			0
scroll down for @entity26 the successful testing of @entity12 was announced by the @entity1 this week @entity10 's prototype model of @entity12 , which will increased the distance away from a target snipers can successful shoot according to the video , @entity12 is being developed by @entity33 , with funding from @entity10			1
@entity33 is a research and development firm based in @entity35 , @entity36			0
@entity33 was awarded a contract worth $ 25 million in 2010 to develop @entity12			1
according to @entity10 's release , ' @entity12 â€™s specially designed ammunition and real - time optical guidance system help track and direct projectiles to their targets by compensating for weather , wind , target movement and other factors that could impede successful hits			2
' @entity10 says that the bullet created by the project will improve the range of snipers , and improve troop safety as they will be able to shoot and neutralize a target from further away			2
currently , @entity55 snipers are expected to be able to hit a target 600 meters away , 90 per cent of the time			2
with the advent of @entity12 , an increased range to 2,000 meters is promised			0
despite @entity10 's claim that @entity12 is the first bullet of it 's kind , in 2012 , a subsidiary of @entity65 named @entity66 , which does research and development with the @entity55 @entity70 's @entity69 , claimed to be developing their own self - guided bullet			1
snipers will now be able to hit their targets without interference from unfavorable weather conditions @entity12 is not the only kind of self - guiding bullet in development and funded by the @entity55 government			1
another company in @entity36 is also working on a prototype for a bullet guided by lasers @entity66 's bullet uses lasers for guidance , as opposed to @entity12 's onboard computer system ( the specific working of @entity12 are classified			2
) according to @entity66 's website , additional development is needed before a full prototype or test can be performed			0
however , unlike @entity12 , @entity66 plans to make their bullets available to law enforcement in addition to the military			0
according to @entity10 , the next phase of the development of @entity12 is to refine the accuracy and performance of the technology .			0

@entity12 , a self - guided bullet tested in @entity104 , successful in being shot pointed away from intended target and still hitting it
technology will increase distance snipers can shoot from , as well as *decrease* the effect poor weather has on sniper accuracy
@entity33 , the company developing @entity12 , funded $ 25 million by the @entity55 government in 2010 for the project
