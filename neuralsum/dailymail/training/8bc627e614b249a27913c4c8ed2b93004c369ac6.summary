the world 's first hybrid plane that can recharged itself mid flight has been successfully tested , it has been reported			1
the aircraft has been created by a team at @entity5 , working with @entity6 , who carried out the maiden flight at @entity9 , in @entity10			1
but passengers wo n't be boarding a hybrid plane any time soon , as a jetline would only be able to stay airborne for a matter of minutes			2
the demonstration aircraft is powered by parallel hybrid - electric propulsion system and is said to use 30 per cent less fuel than petrol only planes , @entity5 said			1
the world 's first hybrid plane , created by a team at @entity5 , working with @entity6 , has successfully been tested the hybrid plane is said to use 30 per cent less fuel than petrol only planes the aircraft , which is based on a commercially available singe seater , is also able to recharge its batteries in flight			1
based on a commercially available single seater , the aircraft is also able to recharge its batteries in flight			2
during the tests the plane performed a series of ' hops ' along the runway , before a flight at over 1,500 feet			0
the plane , whose hybrid engine was designed and built by engineers at @entity5 with @entity6 funding support , works by the same principle as a hybrid car			1
during take off , when it needs most power , it uses both the petrol engine and the electric motor , but once cruising height is reached the electric motor can be switched onto generator mode			0
this will then recharge the batteries or it can be switched to motor assist mode to save fuel			0
' although hybrid cars have been available for more than a decade , what 's been holding back the development of hybrid or fully - electric aircraft until now is battery technology , ' said dr @entity64 of @entity5 's @entity65 , who led the project			1
' until recently , they have been too heavy and did n't have enough energy capacity			0
but with the advent of improved lithium - polymer batteries , similar to what you 'd find in a laptop computer , hybrid aircraft – albeit at a small scale – are now starting to become viable			0
' dr @entity64 said that while this is an is an important step in the development of hybrid or fully - electric aircraft , more research is required before commercial airliners will be powered entirely with electric motors			2
currently if all the engines and all the fuel in a modern aircraft were replaced by batteries , it would have a total flying time of roughly ten minutes .			0

@entity5 has tested the world 's first hybrid plane in the @entity92
the maiden flight took place at @entity9 in @entity10
the aircraft is said to use 30 per cent less fuel than petrol powered planes
it works on the same principle as a hybrid car and can recharge itself mid flight
