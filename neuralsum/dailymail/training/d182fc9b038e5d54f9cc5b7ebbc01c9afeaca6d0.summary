a @entity1 couple buried their ten - week - old daughter in a @entity4 suburb miles from their home today , after the mayor of the town where they live refused to allow her to be buried there			2
about 200 family members and townspeople attended a @entity11 in @entity12 , a @entity4 commuter town , on monday			1
a hearse then took the small coffin to the town of @entity17 for burial			1
@entity19 offered a gravesite for the baby after @entity12 mayor @entity22 reportedly refused a burial , saying the local cemetery had ' too few plots ' and ' priority is given to those who pay taxes '			1
a top government official said he would investigate			2
whatever the truth , the case has brought to light the racism faced by @entity36 's estimated 20,000 @entity1 , also known as gipsies			2
like @entity63 's parents , most live in makeshift camps with few basic amenities			2
the community in general is regularly linked to crime and anti-social behaviour			0
pictures showed @entity30 and @entity31 sobbing over their daughter @entity63 's white coffin on an damp and overcast morning in @entity17 cemetery			1
most of the mourners appeared to be from the @entity1 community , but others looked like wellwishers who had lent their support out of outrage over the way the tragic case has been handled			0
@entity83 , a @entity1 rights campaigner , said mr @entity22 was simply expressing a hatred of @entity1 which is now widespread across @entity36			1
' it 's about racism , xenophobia , and stigmatisation , ' said mr @entity83 , saying the baby died in hospital in @entity91 from sudden infant death syndrome on @entity93			0
sadness : @entity30 and @entity31 walk behind their daughter 's hearse as it approaches the grave plot difficult : mrs @entity100 stumbles in her grief as she and other mourners follow the slowly moving hearse why ? the couple raise their faces to the sky as they grieve for their daughter , who was just ten weeks old ' the pain of the mother must not be worsened ' : right - wing @entity111 mayor of @entity17 , @entity112 , in front of the town 's city hall			1
he offered a plot for the child 's burial , saying it was a ' question of humanity ' mr and mrs @entity100 are @entity122 who have been living in @entity36 for eight years , sending their two other young children to local schools			1
the plot in @entity17 was made available for their late daughter after @entity112 , the local mayor , said it was a ' question of humanity '			1
' the pain of a mother who carried a child for nine months , and lost her after two and a half months must not be worsened , ' said mr @entity132 as he announced his decision			0
@entity135 's @entity1 gipsies live on two plots without fresh water or electricity			0
there are frequent calls for their camp to be razed			0
mr @entity142 , @entity36 's @entity143 prime minister , is among many who have expressed a desire to see the country rid of its @entity1 community			0
as interior minister , he often approved orders aimed at smashing up @entity1 camps and evicting entire families			0
he said on one occasion : ' the majority of @entity1 should be delivered back to the borders			0
' we are not here to welcome these people â€¦ it 's not @entity36 's job to deal with the misery of the whole world			0
' but he struck a conciliatory note after the scandal surrounding @entity100 's burial , writing on @entity166 : ' refusing a child a burial because of its roots is an insult to its memory , an insult to @entity36			1

@entity12 mayor @entity22 said the local cemetery was too full
the mayor of @entity17 offered one saying it was ' a question of humanity '
after criticism , mayor @entity22 later denied ever refusing a burial site
