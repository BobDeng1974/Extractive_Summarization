controversial : a different sketch from @entity15 comedy show i 'm @entity17 , which shocked unsuspecting art students with a prank where a blind man groped their female life - drawing model ' duped ' : officials at @entity32 ( above ) said they took part in the show in good faith believing it was aimed at challenging attitudes towards disability but the amateur artists at @entity32 , in @entity39 , who had paid £ 300 for the course , failed to see the funny side of last month 's prank			1
one of those taking part in the lesson said : ' they taped up all the windows and set up secret cameras before the people arrived			2
' they then filmed these people in their class without their knowledge or consent to see their reaction			2
' people got up and walked out in disgust , shouting at staff members as they left			2
' another student complained : ' a lot of the people who take these lessons are elderly and were absolutely disgusted by what they saw			1
' @entity63 said officers had ' offered words of advice to the person ' , but said no offence had been committed because both were in on the joke			2

' the man , who was genuinely blind and came with a guide dog , was meant to feel the model and draw her			0
at no point did we think his actions would be crude			0
