by @entity0 @entity1 said on thursday that a super-volcano under the park was not expected to erupt anytime soon -- despite a video that claimed bison had been fleeing to avoid such a catastrophe and terrified the public			2
park officials , who fielded dozens of calls and emails since the video went viral this week following an earthquake in the park , said the video actually shows bison running down a paved road that leads deeper into the park			1
' it was a spring - like day and they were frisky			0
contrary to online reports , it 's a natural occurrence and not the @entity22 , ' park spokeswoman @entity19 said			0
commentary with one of the clips by a self - described survivalist wearing camouflage , dark sunglasses and a black watch cap suggests the wildlife exodus may be tied to ' an imminent eruption here at @entity27			0
' a viral video showed bison ' running from ' @entity47 earlier this week , raising concerns over a possible super-volcano eruption			0
officials clarified the bison were in fact running further into the park park officials fielded dozens of calls and emails since the video went viral			2
park spokeswoman @entity19 said , ' it was a spring - like day and they were frisky ' super-volcanoes are considered the second most globally cataclysmic event , next to an asteroid strike , @entity60 reported earlier in january			1
the super-volcano at @entity27 last erupted at about 640,000 years ago and sent more than 1,000 cubic kilometers of ash and lava into the air			1
the 4.8 magnitude earthquake that struck early sunday near the @entity71 in the northwest section of @entity27 , which spans 3,472 square miles of @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , caused no injuries or damages and did not make any noticeable alterations to the landscape , geologists said			2
though benign by seismic standards , the earthquake was the largest to rattle @entity27 since a 4.8 quake in february 1980 and it occurred near an area of ground uplift tied to the upward movement of molten rock in the super-volcano , whose mouth , or caldera , is 50 miles long and 30 miles wide			1
super-volcanoes are considered the second most globally cataclysmic event , next to an asteroid strike			1
@entity93 , an area of the park , is visible here but neither the quake , the largest among hundreds that have struck near the geyser basin in the last seven months , nor the uplift suggest an eruption sooner than tens of thousands of years , said @entity101 , associate director for science and technology at the @entity105 's @entity104 in @entity106			1
' the chance of that happening in our lifetimes is exceedingly insignificant , ' said @entity101 , a scientist with the @entity111			0
@entity101 said the area of uplift that scientists have been tracking since august is rising at a rate of between 10 centimeters ( 4 inches ) and 15 centimeters a year			0
geologists who tracked uplift in the same area from 1996 to 2003 also saw elevated seismic activity , he said .			0

officials said video actually shows bison running down paved road that leads into the park
assurances did little to quell fears among thousands who viewed video

sunday 's 4.8 - magnitude quake was the largest at @entity27 since 1980
