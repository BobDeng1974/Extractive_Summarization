the saturday night sketch comes just a week after @entity42 sucked milk from a woman 's breasts on the show			1
host @entity42 had invited a group of women from a charity which allows the exchange of breast milk between mothers to his entertainment show , @entity100			1

one of the women offered him a bottle of the milk but @entity42 said he would prefer to drink from the source			1
' well , if you do n't bite you may try it , ' the volunteer , named @entity111 , said			2

' i find the second one better tasting , but i can taste that you 've eaten asparagus yesterday , ' de @entity5 quipped			2
the segment has generated criticism on social media but volunteer @entity111 defended the unusual exchange , saying it was ' for a good cause '			2
@entity38 has today released this statement : ' last saturday ‘ @entity129 ’ , the satirical part of the @entity1 television program ‘ @entity100 ’ , referred to the recent attack in @entity51			0
this is experienced by some viewers as inappropriate			0
' we would like to respond			0
the attack in the @entity136 was shocking and is a human drama			0
this is not only public opinion but also the opinion of broadcaster @entity38 , presenter @entity42 and those involved in the making of ‘ @entity129 ’			0
' everyone handles the feelings that tragedies like these raise in their own way			0
comedians often prefer to deal with difficult emotions by joking about them			0
many times that works well			0
an important function of humor is it being an outlet			0
but sometimes it does n’t work well			0
the pain and the shock that a particular incident has brought about is so intense that there is – for some – no place for airiness			0
‘ @entity129 ’ is an independent part within the program ‘ @entity100 ’ and is written and developed without host @entity42			1
the creative team is responsible for what they do			0
' the joke with the two @entity136 was actually not at the expense of the dead soldier			0
a very absurd side of reality ( the insane attack ) was compared to a trivial side of reality ( the madness surrounding the @entity16 )			0
if people will feel hurt , we regret that			0
' it was signed ' the creators of @entity129 '			0
