@entity20 editor @entity3 and her husband @entity21 were loaned a @entity14 horse named @entity7 in 2008 it emerged in spring 2012 that mrs @entity3 , the @entity24 and @entity20 editor , had been lent the 24 - year - old retired @entity14 horse between 2008 and 2010			1

mr @entity35 said : ‘ as we were being shown round the stables , she told me that @entity5 would also be riding the retired police horse			2
after several days of trying to dodge the question , in 2012 @entity5 finally admitted that he had indeed ridden @entity7 ‘ at the time i did not think much of it , other than to wonder why she told me that			0
she may have been trying to show off , but it was a curious thing to say			0
’ questions about the horse , and whether mr @entity5 had ridden it , emerged when the spotlight fell on the nature of close relationships between journalists , the police and politicians			1
in late february 2012 mr @entity5 ’s official spokesman initially insisted : ‘ the only horses i am interested in are the type you can put a bet on			1

’ in 2010 the horse was returned to the @entity14 , where it later died			2
