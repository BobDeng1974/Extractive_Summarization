cancer will become a manageable condition rather than a death sentence within a decade , experts boldly predicted yesterday			1
scientists believe they are close to rolling out a radical technique that allows them to develop extremely personalised cancer treatments , that will substantially increase life expectancy			1
they think within five to ten years they will be able to sequence the dna of tumours in every cancer patient – allowing doctors to deliver a highly tailored treatment			1
mammogram : scientists believe they are close to rolling out a radical technique that allows them to develop extremely personalised cancer treatments , that will substantially increase life expectancy the work , due to start at the £ 3million @entity21 in @entity22 this year , is expected to pave the way for radical forms of diagnosis , surveillance and therapy			1
doctors think closely examining the genetic make - up of every individual tumour will revolutionise the effectiveness of the treatments at their disposal			2
they say the technique could substantially increase life expectancy , allowing terminally - ill patients to live for a decade or more in good health			1
for example , one patient at the @entity39 in @entity40 has been taking the breast cancer drug herceptin for a decade , although this is considered an exceptional case			1
professor @entity45 , chief executive of the @entity46 , which is running the project , said : ‘ none of this is science fiction			0
' one would think in five or ten years this will be absolutely routine practice for every cancer patient , and that ’s what we ’re aiming to bring about			2
‘ we should be aspiring to cure cancer , but for people with advanced disease , it will be a question of managing them better so they survive for much longer – for many years			1
‘ @entity1 often appears in people who are old , and if we can keep them alive long enough for them to die of something else , then we are turning cancer into a chronic disease			1
’ genetic profiling of cancer is already being investigated at several laboratories around the world , but the new unit will pioneer its use , he said			0
for example , patients with advanced breast cancer are tested to determine if their tumours have a particular type of the @entity78 gene , responsible for 20 per cent of cases			1
skin cancer patients with a particular type of melanoma may also be prescribed the life - prolonging drug @entity83			1
scientists : currently , all cancer drugs go through a process that ends with a big trial involving several thousand patients			1
such trials are designed to look for small success rates across large population ( file picture ) professor @entity45 's team will use the techniques to track cancers as they progress , mutate and develop resistance to drugs			0
at the moment , tumour @entity101 has to be profile using an invasive biopsy			2
but the scientists now hope to develop a blood test to identify dna floating around the body from tumours instead			1
they hope the programme will shed light on currently intractable problems such as so - called ‘ unknown primaries ’ – cancers of unknown origin that account for one in 20 cancers			0
it may also start to reshape the way trials of cancer treatments are conducted			2

one would think in five or ten years this will be absolutely routine practice for every cancer patient , and that ’s what we ’re aiming to bring about ' professor @entity45 , chief executive of the @entity46 such trials are designed to look for small success rates across large population			0
but they often lead to drugs being marketed that only benefit a minority of the patients who take them			0
for example , only one in ten women given chemotherapy for breast cancer actually responds to the treatment			2
in future , big trials could be replaced by smaller studies providing much more meaningful results			0
each would recruit a few hundred patients whose genetic make - up is likely to suit the treatment being tested			2
professor @entity45 said : ‘ basically , the way we ’re developing drugs for cancer is now failing big time			0
certainly , the idea of developing old - fashioned chemotherapy is going out the window			0
‘ let ’s design the trials for success rather than failure			0
’ the research has been made possible by the rapid reduction in the cost of genetic sequencing			0
it took a decade of work and around £ 2billion to produce the first draft of the human genome , or genetic code , in 2000 .			0

scientists ' close to radical technique to develop personalised treatments '
want to sequence @entity101 of tumours in patients to deliver tailored treatment
could help patients to carry on for a decade in relatively good health
hopes that cancer could become a chronic disease rather than a *killer*
it would pave way for radical forms of diagnosis , surveillance and therapy
