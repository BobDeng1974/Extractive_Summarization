mr @entity1 will appoint an independent expert to advance the idea and will host a summit to promote the ' @entity4 economy ' in the summer			1
he will say : ' liberals believe strongly in the virtues of the market but only if it is a market for the many , not a market for the few			2
' we do n't believe our problem is too much capitalism			2
we think it 's that too few people have capital			2
' we need more individuals to have a real stake in their firms			2
more of a @entity4 economy , if you like			2
' ' @entity44 was the decade of share ownership			2
i want this to be the decade of employee share ownership			0
' staff at @entity4 stores own shares in the company which mr @entity1 says leads to lower absenteeism , staff turnover and production costs at an event hosted by the @entity60 and the @entity61 think tank , he will say the concept of employee ownership has been a ' touchstone ' of liberal thinking since the 19th century			1
' and what many people do n't realise about employee ownership is that it is a hugely underused tool in unlocking growth			0
@entity72 business secretary , @entity71 , said the plan followed @entity75 's lead on responsible capitalism ' i do n't value employee ownership because i believe it is somehow ' nicer ' - a more pleasant alternative to the rest of the corporate world			1
' firms that have engaged employees , who own a chunk of their company , are just as dynamic , just as savvy , as their competitors			0
in fact , they often perform better			0
in general , higher productivity and higher wages			0
' they weathered the economic downturn better than other companies			0
' @entity100 business minister @entity99 will be in charge of the drive within the government to work out the barriers to employee ownership so that they can be removed			0
he will be looking specifically at the possibility of introducing a universal right for employees to request shares in the companies they work for			0
@entity111 , the @entity100 chief secretary to the treasury , will be studying tax arrangements for employee - owned firms			1

annually it has sales of over £ 8.2bn and staff ' share in the benefits and profits of a business that puts them first '			0

he signed away his personal ownership rights in what he described as an ' experiment in industrial democracy '			0
a source close to mr @entity1 said : ' @entity1 wants to see real change in the way we do business , and firms that give employees a real stake			1
' he is pushing his government colleagues for real , early , radical action on this			1
' employee ownership is part of a long liberal tradition of economic reform - putting power in the hands of workers to build a more responsible capitalism			2
' @entity72 business secretary @entity71 said mr @entity1 was following @entity75 's lead on responsible capitalism			1
' @entity170 has led calls for a more responsible capitalism and , despite having first scorned @entity75 's initiative , @entity174 now claims he has become a convert to the cause , ' he said			0
' the question for both him and @entity1 is whether they have the courage or the conviction to make the change that is needed			1
' if @entity1 wishes to follow @entity75 's lead in promoting shareholder activism and engagement , that is welcome			1
' @entity1 today said he would continue to push for a ' mansion tax ' on high - value properties but admitted he is facing stiff resistance from within the coalition			1
he said that as a result of discussions with conservatives , any progress on the tax would depend on ' give and take ' negotiations			2
@entity1 is pressing chancellor @entity195 to use his march 21 budget to target the rich with new taxes , in the hope of countering concerns that the government 's deficit - reduction programme is unfair on ordinary families			1
according to @entity205 , as well as a tax on homes worth more than £ 2 million , @entity100 ministers want the chancellor to introduce measures to stop the rich avoiding stamp duty when they sell their properties			1
answering questions after a speech in the @entity213 today , mr @entity1 said : ' very , very high - value properties are taxed in exactly the same way at the moment as properties which are a fraction of their value - so a £ 10 million property at the moment is taxed in the same way as a £ 1 million property			1
' it is quite right for us - and @entity100 @entity100 have done this for years - to say ' well , hang on a moment , should we be trying to look at some way to make sure that these people who own these multimillion - pound properties pay their fair share ? '			1
' i stick to my guns that i think that is something we should do			0
' but this is a coalition government			0
we did n't win the election			0
i lead a party with 8 % of mps in @entity239			0
' if the @entity100 were in power , i think we would have moved on this much , much more quickly			0
' i will continue to argue the case for this			0
i hope we will make some progress , but this is a process of give and take in a coalition @entity202			0
' mr @entity1 said it was a long - standing @entity247 position , which he backed , to ' support taxes which capture unearned wealth and lower taxes on effort , enterprise , initiative and hard work ' .			1
