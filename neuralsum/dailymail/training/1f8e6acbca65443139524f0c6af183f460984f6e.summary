by @entity0 published : 08:56 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 09:10 est , 7 august 2013 a former farm worker had to call upon his experience of lambing to deliver his baby daughter at home after frantic phone calls to a labour ward went unanswered			2
@entity8 , 25 , became a temporary midwife , and then a father to his daughter @entity11 , after helping wife @entity12 , 31 , through the birth			1
his experience of lambing came in useful when his wife began having contractions at 3am on july 27			2
@entity8 , 25 , had to call upon his knowledge of lambing when his wife , @entity12 , 31 , gave birth to their daughter , @entity11 , in their living room mrs @entity23 gave birth in the living room of the couple 's home in @entity28 at 5.45am after struggling to contact the labour ward at the city 's @entity30 for almost three hours			1
mr @entity8 said : ‘ @entity32 took over to look after them			1
i had to keep it together and get on with it			0
‘ there should 've been someone at least on the phone to be able to talk to us			0
’ he added : ‘ i became really involved with the lambing at a friend ’s farm when i was at school and sometimes i 'd be on the farm for around 12 hours a day			0
‘ @entity46 is not that different to being a midwife as the main thing is to keep calm and be careful			0
‘ i had reared hundreds of lambs during my time on the farm , but it 's nothing that compares to the feeling of becoming a midwife for @entity11 and @entity12			1
when mrs @entity23 went into labour , the couple repeatedly tried to call @entity30 , in @entity28 , but they claim that they did not get an answer when they could n't contact @entity30 's , the couple called @entity61 , where staff told them to wait until the contractions were five minutes apart before trying @entity30 's again ‘ my heart was racing and inside i was shaking uncontrollably			1
thankfully i managed to compose myself in front of @entity12			2
‘ the only training i have is first aid , and i think @entity12 was really proud of how i managed to deliver @entity11 safely			2
‘ i ca n't wait to be able to tell @entity11 when she grows up the story that we have and how she was born			2
’ when mrs @entity23 went into labour she called her hospital , @entity30 ’s , but says she got no reply so called @entity61 instead			1
when the birth was imminent , they say they still could n't get in touch with @entity30 's so they called an ambulance			1
the call handler talked mr @entity8 through the birth medical staff told her to wait at home until her contractions were five minutes apart before she called back , but when she did , she says she was told to keep trying @entity30 's			1
she kept trying @entity30 ’s every few minutes but claims that she got no answer and did not have time to drive to the hospital			1
mrs @entity23 said : ‘ when i rang @entity61 , they told me to call back when my contractions reached five minutes apart , and when i did , they told me to keep trying @entity30 's , who would n't pick up			1
‘ i felt like i had been sent round the block and felt fobbed off by both hospitals , one of which did n't answer			0
@entity11 was born at 5.45am on july 27			2
paramedics arrived five minutes after the birth and took the trio to @entity30 ‘ in hindsight , i would have called the ambulance service earlier but we were told not to bother ringing the emergency services and keep trying the labour ward at @entity30 's			1
‘ when we finally arrived at @entity30 's after the ambulance took us there , there were around six people sat behind the desks so i ca n't believe no - one was there to answer our call			1
’ mr @entity8 eventually called 999 when it became apparent that the birth was imminent , and an operator talked him through the delivery			1
paramedics were on the scene about five minutes after @entity11 was born and the new family were finally taken to @entity115			1
a spokesman for @entity117 said : ' we are sorry ms @entity23 had difficulty in contacting @entity30 's maternity unit and can find no explanation as other calls were received ' mother - of - three mrs @entity23 , said : ‘ i had no choice but to have @entity8 play midwife			1
he 's a proper hero and i could n't have done it without him			0
‘ it 's disgusting that they were n't around to help people and did n't pick up the phone			0
it made me really mad because it put my life at risk			0
‘ i 'm lucky we had a happy ending with @entity11			2
it was traumatic but we have a beautiful baby and i 'd like to thank the paramedics			0
’ she added : ‘ i just do n't want it to happen to anybody else			0
’ speaking of her husband ’s actions , mrs @entity23 said : ‘ i knew @entity8 had done farming before but he had no training during my pregnancy on how to deliver a baby			2
‘ he 's my hero and i could n't ask for a better husband			0
it 's the ultimate thing for a husband to do to deliver his own daughter			0
’ the hospital says that it is happy to discuss mrs @entity23 ' concerns with her if she wishes			0
she says she just does n't want anyone else to have the same experience the couple , who are both full - time parents , also have another daughter @entity159 , 13 months , and mrs @entity23 has another child from a previous relationship			0
a spokesman for @entity117 said : ‘ we are sorry ms @entity23 had difficulty in contacting @entity30 's maternity unit and can find no explanation as other calls were received and logged during that period			1
‘ ms @entity23 did contact the maternity assessment centre at the @entity61 on three occasions and spoke to one of the midwives who , based on the details provided , advised her accordingly			2
‘ unfortunately she went on to deliver her baby very quickly following the last call			0
@entity174 can be unpredictable when a woman has had more than one child			0
‘ if ms @entity23 would like to contact us we are happy to discuss her concerns			0
