allegations that a secret undercover police unit carried out spying operations on @entity4 need to be investigated immediately , @entity0 demanded this morning			1
the deputy prime minister said the idea that elected politicians were being ' snooped on ' because of their views ' appalled ' him and urged the home secretary @entity9 to order a wider probe into undercover police tactics to investigate allegations			1
it comes after a former officer , @entity13 , said he read files on 10 mps during his 11 years working for the @entity17 's now notorious @entity16			1
the deputy prime minister said the idea that elected politicians were being ' snooped on ' because of their views ' appalled ' him he said the files included @entity21 's now deputy leader @entity20 , former cabinet minister @entity22 and @entity23 , later home secretary			1
details about the targets were collected by officers infiltrating anti-racism and other left wing political groups , and apparently continued after they were elected to @entity30			1
the former officer claimed he personally collected information on @entity33 , @entity34 and the late @entity35 and said special branch collected intelligence on @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , and @entity41			1
the pink files were ' very extensive ' he said , and included details of a subject 's political beliefs , family relationships , personal background , education , and finances			1
some contained details of ' personal and private matters ' , he said			0
if true , the files on many of the subjects existed years after they entered @entity30			2
four of those on his list became ministers during his time in @entity61			0
the revelations prompted demands for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policy to be widened to include the new allegations			2
speaking on @entity67 this morning , mr @entity0 said the allegations , if true , were ' absolutely terrible '			1
he said : ' the idea that the police snooping and monitoring elected politicians in effect because of their views - because they were deemed to be from the left , that they were somehow dodgy - it absolutely appalls me			2
' i know there 's an inquiry into undercover police tactics and i very much hope it will look at these allegations because they are not the kind of thing you want in a free society			1
' politicians , regardless of their views , should be able to represent their constituents and express their opinions without being monitored by the police			2
' a secret undercover police unit carried out spying operations on now deputy labour leader @entity20 ( left ) and former foreign secretary @entity23 mr @entity13 was an undercover officer between 1993 and 1997 in the now disbanded @entity93			1
he infiltrated left wing groups and causes which were deemed to potentially pose a threat to national security			0
he told the @entity98 : ' when i was deployed undercover in the @entity16 , any mp that i came across , such as on demonstrations , i would report back on them '			0
' when they became mps these files carried on			2
it [ was ] your duty as an @entity16 officer to report back any intelligence that you come across			2
' ' i felt that it was ok to report back on mps , ' he said			2
' i used to give myself a pat on the back , thinking ' i have done a good job '			0
these mps were spied on and they should know			0
' ' i do n't think the police force should be monitoring @entity4 , full stop			0
i do n't think we have any right to do that at all			0
it may be justifiable to say that the @entity122 should be doing it - but i certainly do n't think the police should be doing it			0
' mr @entity22 told the @entity126 : ' that the special branch had a file on me dating back 40 years ago to anti-aparthied and @entity130 activist days is hardly revelatory			1
' that these files were still active for at least 10 years while i was an mp certainly is and raises fundamental questions about parliamentary sovereignty			0
' @entity134 pointed out that @entity138 the internal police investigation into the unit was still ongoing , but that mr @entity13 had refused to speak to it about his claims			1
a former officer said he read files on 10 mps during his 11 years working for the @entity16 including @entity33 ( left ) and special branch collected intelligence on @entity40 ( right ) special branch also investigated @entity147 mayor @entity38 ( right ) and former welsh secretary @entity22 ( left ) who said the files raised ' fundamental questions ' about parliamentary sovereignty a @entity17 spokesman said : ' @entity138 has previously reported publicly on @entity16 methodology and remains a live ongoing investigation			1
' @entity138 maintains that without speaking to @entity13 it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes			1
@entity138 remains very willing to engage with him			0
' the taxpayer faces a compensation bill running into the tens of millions of pounds from miscarriages of justice linked to a the @entity16			0
hundreds of animal rights activists , neo-nazi groups , campaigners for black justice and other campaigners who , unknowingly , were spied on by the @entity16 could have their convictions overturned			0
