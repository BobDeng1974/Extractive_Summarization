by @entity0 the @entity2 on wednesday were a glittering spectacle of all the greatest tv talent in the @entity5 and i was privileged to be a guest of ok ! magazine at the @entity8 to see @entity9 walk away with the best presenter award for the 13th year running			1
the red - carpet at @entity13 ’s @entity12 was possibly the busiest i ’ve ever seen – it was crammed full of tv celebrities and literally hundreds of journalists of every description , tv , radio , magazines , newspapers , online were crammed behind the barriers and also my made in @entity23 colleague @entity0 , who was pulling in a shift for @entity25 ! @entity0 - who my father calls ' @entity31 ' because he ’s heir to the @entity29 ’s fortune - interviewed me on the carpet and i have to say he was very good			1
at first he put me at ease with his usual bonhomie and friendly patter and then hit me with some really tough questions			0
@entity0 says @entity0 got him to reveal too much in interview ( left ) on the red carpet where he also bumped into another fellow @entity0 star @entity0 ( right ) @entity0 cheekily awarded more than one star his ' @entity40 ' award at the @entity41 including i 'm a celebrity star @entity42 ( left ) and @entity43 cast member @entity44 ( left ) he probably got me to reveal far too much and from what i heard was also equally charming with the ladies			1
he totally disarmed i ’m a celebrity star @entity42 by presenting her with his ' @entity40 at the @entity48 2014 ' award on the night			0
the award did lose a little bit of its sparkle however when @entity42 bumped into @entity43 star @entity44 in the @entity53 ! magazine suite and found that @entity44 also had won the fittest award , and then they both discovered that pretty much every other gorgeous girl in a frock who had walked past him had won the award			0
by my reckoning he had probably given out about ten ' fittest girl ' awards on the night			0
just a quick tip here @entity0 - if you are going to hedge your bets at a party by telling a few women that they are the best looking then you ’d better be sure they are n’t going to be able to compare notes during the evening that can tend to back - fire a bit			2
@entity0 admits his tux was feeling a bit tight at the awards last night here ’s just a few quick tips on how to do the classic black tie			1
do n’t ever do clip on bow ties , always do up your own tie			0
do wear @entity82 slippers – and if you do opt for slippers do n’t wear socks			0
also the tuxedo test is always a good indicator if you have put on weight – it ’s a suit that you only wear about three or four times a year and if it ’s feeling a bit tight around the tummy then you know it ’s time to take trip to the gym			0
after my extended holiday in @entity98 mine was feeling a little bit tighter than i ’d hoped so i will be looking to book myself into no 1 @entity100 fairly soon for a bit of a refresher course			1
my holiday in @entity98 was quite eventful after the @entity105 celebrations and i was chuffed to receive a @entity107 message from a not - so - old friend of mine , the totally stunning model @entity110			1
she was staying on the nearby island of @entity113 and remembered that my family own a hotel on @entity98 and so thought it was a safe bet that i might be there			2
i ’ve known @entity110 for a few years , and we met when i was promoting nightclubs in @entity13			2
it was great to hear from her and it would have been rude not to agree to show her round barts for a few days			0
just friends : @entity0 and @entity110 first sparked romance rumours with this @entity126 picture last week @entity0 says that both being on holiday with friends made for a fun break she was on holiday with a friend , as was i , so we made a very entertaining foursome to go out to the beaches and for dinners			1
now i realise that given my previous history some @entity138 readers may find this hard to believe but we were only ' just good friends '			0
@entity110 is an utterly lovely girl and i hope that i see her again soon , but sadly our little holiday has now run out and she left to do a big modeling job in @entity143 and i ’m back filming for made in @entity23			1
all the best , @entity0 xxx			2
