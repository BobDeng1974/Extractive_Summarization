by @entity0 published : 11:08 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 11:24 est , 25 july 2013 when @entity2 played the first ever gig at the £ 60million @entity4 last night , it was supposed to be a landmark event for the cultural life of @entity8 's third - largest city			1
but one jobsworth council employee was determined to deflate the celebratory atmosphere - by slapping parking tickets on @entity2 's tour trucks outside the venue			1
city officials - who have keenly promoted the historic concert - have been hugely embarrassed by the blunder , and have agreed to let mr @entity2 's entourage off the fines they would have accrued			1
hard at work : a parking attendant was pictured writing a ticket for @entity2 's tour trucks the moment was captured yesterday afternoon when a parking attendant was photographed writing a ticket for the huge articulated lorries			1
the trucks were parked on double yellow lines outside the venue at the north end of the city centre			0
@entity32 today stood up for the worker , saying he was just doing his job - but a spokesman acknowledged that the incident had left officials red - faced			1
' we accept this is a little embarrassing but , to be fair , the attendant was doing his job - if a little too efficiently , ' he said			0
gig : @entity2 is the first artist ever to perform at the £ 60million @entity4 , a major project for the city ' these were somewhat unusual circumstances with a very large tour involving a tight turnaround of vehicles arriving from the previous night 's show in @entity50 on the opening night of a brand new venue			1
' the parking tickets were legitimately issued as the area concerned had double - yellow lines and was outside the agreed area for trucks to park to access the arena			2
' having considered the special circumstances , the tickets were quickly cancelled			0
' when you prepare a city to open and host a huge , state - of - the - art new venue , you 're bound to get the odd teething trouble			0
' this was the only slight problem on a historic night for @entity32 as the months and years of planning came together to put on an incredible show which everyone who was there will never forget			0
' landmark : the arena is the first major music venue to be built in @entity8 's third - largest city one bystander told the @entity77 : ' a couple of jobsworths have come down here - the stick they have got from people is hilarious			0
' they are not parked illegally , they are just parked down a side street			0
' even though @entity88 is the third - largest city in the country , with a population of 750,000 , it rarely receives visits from the biggest musical acts because it lacks a large arena such as those in @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			0
the 13,500 - seat @entity4 is an attempt to remedy this , and it has already topped a list of ' new venues to watch ' in the @entity103 magazine @entity102			2
mr @entity2 's sell - out appearance last night was the first at the new venue , but the official opening will not be until september , when sir @entity108 plays			2
the parking ticket is not the first time the @entity113 rocker has fallen foul of @entity8 bureaucracy - last year , officials pulled the plug on his concert in @entity118 's @entity117 when he broke the curfew by teaming up with @entity120 for a blockbuster encore .			1

rocker played first ever gig at @entity4 , promoted by local officials
but council parking attendant was seen slapping tickets on his entourage
red - faced officials say they will let @entity2 off having to *pay* a fine
