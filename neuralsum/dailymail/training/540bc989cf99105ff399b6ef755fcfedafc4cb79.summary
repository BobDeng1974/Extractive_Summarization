by @entity0 last updated at 11:29 am on 2nd november 2011 newly - released maths scores have revealed that @entity3 fourth and eighth grade children are doing better than ever in the subject - but are still behind national targets			1
the @entity3 government 's ' @entity6 ' law aims to make every child in @entity3 proficient in maths and reading by 2014			1
results issued today show that in maths , 40 per cent of fourth - grade students and 35 per cent in the eighth grade have currently reached that level			1
among eighth - graders , average math scores climbed by a single point over 2009 and by 21 points over 1990			2
in reaction to the scores issued by the @entity38 , education secretary @entity39 said they were ' reason for concern as much as optimism '			0
he said in a statement : ' while student achievement is up since 2009 in both grades in mathematics and in 8th grade reading , it ’s clear that achievement is not accelerating fast enough for our nation ’s children to compete in the knowledge economy of the @entity56			2
' after significant @entity38 gains in the 1990s , particularly in mathematics , the 2011 results continue a pattern of modest progress			0
' a graph shows the gradual improvement on @entity3 school pupils in maths since 1990 on the up : eighth grade @entity3 children are also showing a marked improvement in maths in the past 20 years statistics show the percentage of @entity3 fourth grade children who are above the basic level in maths ( dark green ) , above proficient ( pale green ) and at advanced levels ( mid green ) while more eighth graders are also achieving good maths scores , their proficiency is still behind national targets the @entity84 's @entity83 administers the test every two years			1
the only @entity3 state where student scores in maths and reading increased at both fourth and eighth grade level in the past two years was @entity90			1
@entity91 was the only state to score lower in math among fourth - graders in 2011 , compared to 2009			2
@entity94 , chairman of the @entity95 , said : ' over the past two decades major gains have occurred in mathematics achievement , but only modest improvements in reading			0
' despite better math scores , progress has slowed and achievement gaps between races remain ' unacceptably wide , ' he said			0
there were few noticeable changes in the achievement gap between white and black students from 2009			0
the data for maths results in the @entity3 is collected every two years from the @entity38 while the gap is smaller than in the early 1990s , the new test results reflect a 25 - point difference between white and black fourth - and eighth - graders in reading and fourth - graders in math. however , @entity119 students in eighth grade made some small strides to narrow the gap with white students in both math and reading			1
the results , known as @entity128 's @entity127 , also revealed that @entity133 students , this year for the first time in their own category , had the highest scores of any single group .			0

government hope to make every @entity3 child proficient in maths and reading by 2014
best ever results in maths , but children still behind national target
