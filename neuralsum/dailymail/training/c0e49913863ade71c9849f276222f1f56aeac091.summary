@entity0 and @entity1 combined for an @entity2 one - two in a gripping women ’s road race on sunday when @entity5 threw the worst of its weather at the men ’s race , an event so drenched it became semi-aquatic — and utterly extraordinary			1
just 12 of 140 men finished their 168km ( 105 - mile ) course			1
for more than two - thirds of it , the field was headed by the @entity18 ’s @entity17			1
his gutsy ( or borderline insane , delete as applicable ) breakaway with 160km of the race remaining was always likely to be sunk			0
indeed it was , drowned even , but @entity17 was one of the dozen good men and true to cross the finish line			1
not that he concluded simply			0
the 28 - year - old suffered a puncture with just 6km left that brought him to a halt			2
for the first few moments of that delay it seemed feasible @entity45 ’s @entity44 or @entity2 ’s @entity46 might catch him			1
that pair and @entity33 had reeled in @entity17 ’s one - man breakaway with 49km left , then the @entity52 made his own break from the other two on the final lap of 12 around the city			2
but @entity33 had enough time to change his wheel before being caught and powered away in spray that characterised the entirety of his 4hr 13min 5sec ride			0
@entity44 and @entity46 summoned energy from somewhere to sprint against each other down the home straight , @entity44 crossing millimetres ahead for silver in the same time of 4hr 14min 26sec as @entity46 , who took bronze			1
in a race as epically sodden as yesterday ’s it is worth name - checking all those who finished			1
@entity2 ’s @entity72 was fourth , ahead of @entity73 of @entity74 , a nation that had won this event for four straight games and never missed the podium before sunday			1
@entity33 ’s @entity34 team - mate @entity78 was sixth , then @entity80 @entity79 and @entity17 , supported throughout by injured @entity18 team - mate @entity81 , looking demented at times as he yelled encouragement from a car window			2
at long last : @entity0 finished silver in @entity85 four years ago as well as in the @entity86 @entity87 ( @entity88 ) and @entity89 ( @entity34 ) were ninth and 10th ahead of @entity91 ’s @entity90 in his swansong ride of a long , turbulent and ultimately inspirational career			1
@entity94 of @entity74 was 12th and that was it			1
‘ that was such a grim day , ’ said @entity33			0
‘ i felt terrible at the start			0
i was thinking of just stopping i felt that bad			0
everyone else seemed to come down to my level then			0
i was surprised how easily i went away ( on the final lap )			0
when i had the puncture i thought “ what have i got to do ? ” but fortunately i had a decent enough gap to stay in front			0
’ third - placed @entity46 said : ‘ @entity33 was just so strong			2
you could tell he had so much more energy left in the tank			0
’ this was the first @entity34 male road cycling gold ever , and the second @entity34 road gold after @entity114 ’s road - race win in @entity115 in 2002			2
tears of joy : @entity1 won silver for @entity2 in what was her final race in the sport swansong : @entity1 finished 25 seconds behind @entity0 and is retiring to compete in endurance triathlons the women ’s race took in seven laps of the 14km course , and @entity1 played a critical support role as her @entity2 team leader @entity0 triumphed			1
@entity0 , 25 , from @entity129 in @entity130 , had spoken before the race about wanting to put a succession of big - race silvers behind her , including in the @entity28 four years ago and at @entity86			1
‘ i feel like i deserve this , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’ve trained so hard			0
i ’m always on the podium , i do n’t win that many races			0
it ’s just a confidence thing			0
‘ once you ’ve got a big title you can call yourself a champion finally			2
‘ i want to say a massive thank you to @entity143 is a beautiful sport and a team sport , which often gets overlooked			0
so i ’m pleased @entity1 got a silver medal as well			1
’ survival of the fittest : @entity148 came out on top of the 98 - kilometres event in just over 2 hours and 38 minutes @entity151 see out ' outstanding ' @entity28			2

@entity0 is the @entity153 champion
@entity0 finished ahead @entity1 for an @entity2 one - two
@entity157 's @entity156 won bronze in a photo finish ahead of @entity74 's @entity160
