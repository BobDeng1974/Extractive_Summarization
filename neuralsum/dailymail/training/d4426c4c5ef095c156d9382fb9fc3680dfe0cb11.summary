by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 @entity2 is looking forward to the first summer evening of the year this sunday , as high temperatures and a late sunset come together to create a rare golden afternoon			1
swathes of the @entity8 will be revelling in the sunshine all weekend , with temperatures soaring to @entity11 on saturday and @entity12 on sunday			1
the mild weather is another dramatic shift as , even today , parts of the @entity16 and @entity3 were buried under a layer of snow			1
this snowfall is expected to continue , particularly the @entity21 area , tomorrow , but will be thawing by the start of the weekend			2
a car battles through the frost on @entity21			0
weather today and tomorrow is predicted to be chilly , despite forecasts for temperatures of up to @entity12 this weekend frost covering @entity28 , @entity21			1
wintry showers and hail storms have also been reported across the country in what could be the last gasp of the winter months @entity34 has been settling on @entity21 just days before the start of @entity36 should mark the shift in seasons as well as the higher temperatures in the @entity8 , caused by warm air blowing in from the continent and moving up the country , this sunday marks the beginning of @entity36 ( bst ) , meaning the clocks move forward by one hour			1
as a result , sunset in the @entity3 - which will enjoy the warmest evening - will not be until 7.31pm			1
the high of @entity12 on sunday is twice the average for this time of year and will see the mercury rise higher here than in @entity51 , @entity52 or @entity53 , @entity54 and match , degree for degree , the temperature in @entity59 , @entity60			1
it will be twice as hot in southeast @entity2 as in @entity62 , @entity63			1
even hay fever sufferers will be able to enjoy the weather , with the pollen count peaking at a moderate level in central and southern @entity2 and remaining low across the rest of the country			1
uv levels will also remain low , peaking in the southeast , at midday on saturday , at just three out of six			2
however , it wo n't be sunbathing weather for everyone as temperatures will be closer in the northern regions			1
the coldest area will be northern @entity78 , particularly the @entity79 , where the @entity80 predicts an optimistic high of @entity82			1
the weather forecast for the next three days			2
unsettled weather today and tomorrow will give way to a milder weekend , with temperatures peaking on sunday the sharp change in the weather is just another instance in a year of extremes for the @entity92 climate while @entity21 , pictured , is cold at the moment , it will have milder weather by saturday			1
however , northern regions of the @entity92 will be chilly throughout the weekend a car navigates frosty roads near @entity99 in @entity100			2
next week should see temperatures settle into the teens with the possibility of showers a last shot of winter has hit parts of @entity92 with a flurry of snow before temperatures are set to rise at the weekend			1
parts of south west @entity2 received a dusting of white as well as higher ground on the @entity116 and @entity117 border			1
wintry showers and hail storms have also been reported across the country			2
snow ploughs were seen clearing snow near @entity123 , in @entity124 , which claims to be the highest cafe in @entity2			2
@entity126 , forecast manager at @entity127 , said : ' there 's been a covering of snow over @entity21 , some in places in @entity78 and other parts of high ground			1
' over the next few hours a few more showers of snow will continue towards the south west of @entity2 and a little bit for the @entity139 too			2
@entity124 and @entity117 are two regions currently blanketed in snow , the @entity16 and @entity3 will get more cold weather before it improves on the weekend temperatures this week have been average or just below for this time of year but this weekend will soar to twice what would be normally expected the weather in @entity146 , on the @entity124 and @entity117 border , has been snowy and will get further light showers today and tomorrow a terrier , @entity150 , plays with ponies in @entity21			1
the snow may be gone in a matter of days but people are making the best of it while they can ' as we get towards the weekend there will be a change in the wind which will pull warm air from the continent and temperatures in @entity164 might get up to the 19 or 20 degrees			1
' ' some areas will enjoy the warmer weather but there also will be exceptions			0
further to the east and above the @entity172 area there be will a south east wind which will be chilly			0
' however , for the rest of the country , the reappearance of the sun means the chill will begin to melt away			0
@entity179 from the @entity80 said : ' it is looking mainly dry , with a fair bit of cloud , but some brighter spells in the far west , so parts of west @entity185 and southwestern @entity2 on both saturday and sunday			1
' after seeing a some slightly normal temperatures for this time of year - perhaps slightly cooler during this week - as of saturday we should see temperatures get a bit of a bump up			0
' we could see 19 or 20 maybe , perhaps in the southeast of @entity2 , as we see warmer weather move up from the continent , bringing slightly warmer temperatures than we have seen recently			0
' the average maximum temperature for this time of year is about 10 degrees in @entity2			0
but while temperatures will be a above average , it is not unusual to see them rise above average			0
' however , as the clocks go forward an hour on sunday and we all lose some sleep , the prospect of summer is not something all @entity92 can look forward to			2
mr @entity179 warned that northeastern and eastern parts of the @entity92 will still feel the chill that gripped much of the nation this week			0
he said : ' it will continue to feel fairly chilly and it will be colder in the northeast with some showers expected on sunday			2
' however , he added that come monday , most of the country will see temperatures in their mid-teens , despite the risk of some more rain			2
scientists have discovered a shift in the seasons , with spring arriving early and autumn being delayed			0
@entity221 , professor of geography at the @entity223 , has examined satellite images of vegetation across the northern hemisphere from the past 25 years and found signs that winter is becoming shorter			0
earlier this month , supermarkets @entity228 and @entity230 both announced that @entity2 strawberries were ripening early and hitting the shelves a week earlier than last year			0
professor @entity221 said : ' there is much speculation about whether our seasons are changing and if so , whether this is linked to climate change			0
our study is another significant piece in the puzzle , which may ultimately answer this question			0
' the researchers examined a range of vegetation types with forests which have not been affected by human intervention acting as the best signifier for the changing seasons			0
the most pronounced change found by the researchers was in the broad - leaved deciduous and needle - leaved deciduous forest groups , showing that autumn is becoming significantly later with an early onset of spring			0
professor @entity221 said : ' previous studies have reported trends in the start of spring and end of autumn , but we have studied a longer time period and controlled for forest loss and vegetation type , making our study more rigorous and with a greater degree of accuracy			0
' our research shows that even when we control for land cover changes across the globe , a changing climate is significantly altering the vegetation growth cycles for certain types of vegetation			0
such changes may have consequences for the sustainability of the plants themselves , as well as species which depend on them , and ultimately the climate through changes to the carbon cycle			0
' the project , which involved scientists from the @entity284 at the @entity285 in @entity286 , is published in the journal @entity288 of the @entity289			0
snow ploughs were seen clearing snow near @entity123 , in @entity124 , which claims to be the highest cafe in @entity2 after a warm weekend , temperatures will settle into the teens for next weeks and some showers can be expected across the country with snow still falling in part of the country , is hard to believe that temperatures on sunday will be higher than those in @entity63 and @entity52 the scene today in @entity124			1
parts of the country are still covered in a snow but , while this is predicted to continue today and tomorrow , it will be thawing by the weekend			1

late sunset and warm temperatures will give first summer evening to the @entity3
temperatures in the @entity3 on sunday will hit @entity314 , higher than those in @entity63 , @entity52 and @entity54
the further north you go , the colder it will be , with highs in northern @entity78 peaking at *8c*
despite temperatures being set to soar , snow is forecast across the parts of the country for today and tomorrow
