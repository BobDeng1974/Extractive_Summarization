gurning for the camera clearly is n't anything new if these fascinating photographs from over 100 years ago are anything to go by			1
the newly unearthed pictures from the @entity5 at @entity6 , in @entity7 , prove that our ancestors enjoyed messing around in front of the camera as much as we do			1
from moustachioed gentlemen to laughing ladies and cheeky children , the images show that the notion of those from a bygone era being prim and proper is n't quite true			1
in another photo rows and rows of youngsters are pictured sat up in their beds on friday may 28 , 1926 , with the staff of @entity39 near @entity40			0
the children are pictured under a sign reading ' happiness ' apparently awaiting a visit from the @entity45 who would 10 years later become @entity47			1
and perhaps the most fascinating set of images are the series of @entity52 natives making odd faces for the camera - although the date of these pictures is not known			1
labour of love : @entity59 , founder of @entity60 , spent a year assembling the pictures - which will be exhibited from september 27 technical matter : mr @entity59 said that in the late 1800s the long exposure times meant that holding a smile was quite difficult , so people tended to have a blank expression the collection has been compiled by the museum and @entity59 - who founded the past pictures website @entity60			1
he has spent the past year mining the photographic collection of the @entity6 and @entity5 for fascinating treasure trove which will be exhibited from september 27			1
mr @entity59 , 44 , from @entity72 , said : ' i started retronaut four years ago			1
ever since i was a young boy , i have wanted to go back in time			0
' when i was working in museums , i started to see early colour photographs			0
these photographs did n't look like " the past " , the colour made them look like " now " - but another version of now			1
fun factor : mr @entity59 explained that those from the @entity82 era did clown around in the front of the camera - it was just harder to capture it these pictures of children were taken by a @entity52 photographer visiting the @entity90 and shows the fascinating traditional dress of women in the @entity93 smiles better : while the main subjects of this picture , taken in the @entity93 , hold serious expressions , the two women to the side see a funny side to the situation ' these pictures gave me the closest experience to time - travel i had had			1
i started to collect them , and other pictures that had a similar effect			1
' mr @entity59 said the photographs of people pulling faces in the archive were perhaps the most fascinating aspect of his research			1
he said : ' the exposure time for a photograph in the late 1800s is several seconds - very long by modern standards , but miniscule compared to the first photograph , taken in 1827 and with an exposure of several days			2
' still , that several - second exposure meant that the subject had to stand very still			2
' holding a smile was too difficult , and would either look very false and fixed - or would blur			2
' so people posed with blank and unsmiling faces			0
much as we are asked to do for passport pictures today			2
' if someone a hundred years from now was to judge our temperament from our passports alone , they would conclude we were serious , stilted and stiff			0
' we are not , but the passport medium records us that way			0
in the same way , the @entity136 were recorded as serious , stilted and stiff - but that is the medium we are describing , not the people			2
victorians clowned around - it was just harder to record that photographically			2
' the most interesting thing to me about this archive is that there is nothing especially interesting about it			0
' it is a typical @entity149 county archive collection - in other words , something that most people will not think about very much , unless they are researching their family tree			1
' i wanted to show that archives and museums are the custodians of all our fragments of time			2
and that those fragments can be very arresting and engaging , when cast in the right light			0
' @entity60 has come to mean anachronistic images - pictures which do n't fit with the way we think of the past			1
' and because of this way of selecting images , they usually are very engaging , and create online traffic for their source			2
an unknown group of women pose for an undated photograph , with one clearly keen to show of her chunky hairbrush staff of @entity39 near @entity40 scrubbed this ward to within an inch of its life			2
the beneficiary of this frenzied activity was the @entity45 , who just over 10 years later would become @entity47			0
the children all posed for a photograph under a sign that read ' happiness ' bizarre : a family day out in the early 20th century at a former hanging post known as @entity29 's @entity28 , on @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32			0
named after one @entity29 who was hanged at @entity191 's @entity190 in 1792 for murder and whose body was subsequently displayed as a warning to all ' in other words , @entity110 is like a shop window for archives			0
i want that to continue , and for @entity110 to be able to show more of the world 's archival wonders in its window			0
' @entity203 , director of @entity204 , said the @entity60 project was very important			1
he said : ' archives remain one of the best kept secrets of the heritage sector			0
they contain amazing records covering all aspects of life in the communities around the @entity149 but many people are unsure how to access them or what they contain			0
' at @entity217 and our other museums in @entity32 we have a brilliant track record of enthusing people about their local history and we are keen to find new ways of making sure that our archive collections can also reach the widest possible audience			0
' through his @entity60 work @entity59 has established himself as a world leader in terms of bringing archives to audiences that otherwise would never see them			1
' these audiences are often younger and more comfortable searching the digital world			0
' mr @entity59 will work with archivists from museums and @entity32 to explore its collections and help the organisation reach new audiences			1
it is hoped that a physical exhibition curated by @entity60 will take place at @entity217 in 2014			1
@entity110 's first book has just been published by @entity243			0
hot look : this picture was taken in july 1896 and despite the warm weather , the subject donned a thick skirt and heat - trapping frilly top			0

newly unearthed pictures prove that our ancestors enjoyed messing around in front of the camera as much as we do
the images come from the @entity5 at @entity6 , in @entity7
from laughing ladies to cheeky children , they show that our ancestors were n't as prim and proper as we thought
the collection has been compiled by the museum and @entity59 - who founded the past - pictures website @entity60
