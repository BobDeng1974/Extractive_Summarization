by @entity0 published : 21:00 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 21:00 est , 25 august 2013 a @entity2 man who was born severely deformed has opened up about the incredible surgery , and generous people , he found in @entity5 that helped him to turn his life around			1
@entity9 ' widespread eyes and a bulging forehead brought him scorn and ridicule as a young man living near @entity14 and even his family treated him like a monster			1
his mother died three months after his birth and his father promptly abandoned the family , leaving his grandmother in charge			2
but the now - 52 - year - old high school custodian said she beat him regularly and fed him scraps , specifically chicken leftovers			1
all smiles : glancing into the mirror , his black hair perfectly in place and his smile wide , the once - deformed @entity9 jokes : ' man , i 'm so handsome ' ' i would ask for the legs , and i got the feet , ' he recalled to the @entity37			1
@entity9 was n't allowed to go to school , and his facial deformities meant no one would give him a job			1
at 23 , he finally found work washing cars but the downtrodden man , whose deformities impaired his vision and his breathing , used the cash to buy alcohol and cigarettes			1
' i was angry , ' he said			2
' i was angry with myself , the people			0
' but in december 1984 his luck changed			1
@entity9 was standing in the street when an @entity5 woman named ' @entity55 ' pulled over in a jeep and asked him whether he wanted to go to the @entity5 to see a doctor			1
before : this 1984 photo provided by @entity59 shows @entity60 at age 24 with a severe craniofacial abnormality that severely impacted the quality of his life she took him to an orphanage for disfigured children where @entity9 saw others just like him and felt less alone , he told the newspaper			1
after filling out the necessary paperwork , he packed his few belongings and prepared to board a flight to @entity5			1
he was given an abandoned 14 - month - old boy named @entity74 , who had a large protrusion between his eyes and a fever , to take with him			1
@entity79 - based nonprofit , @entity80 , flew the two to @entity82 and then they were driven to @entity83 , where craniofacial surgeon , dr @entity84 , would change @entity9 ' life forever			1
a selfless couple , @entity86 and @entity87 , took in the @entity88 - speaking @entity9 , @entity74 and a 9 - year - old from @entity90 who was born without ears , despite not sharing their language and having to communicate by sign			0
' i did it because i heard the voice of @entity99 , ' @entity95 told the @entity37			0
' and if i had to do it all over , i 'd do it again			0
he added : ' would you believe me if i told you i did n't even see their deformities ? ' the strangers bonded immediately			0
' @entity87 came up and gave us a hug			0
it was something , because i never had that from my own grandma ' said @entity9 , who for the first time had regular meals and a bed			0
just over a year after he arrived in the @entity5 , @entity9 underwent his first of a series of surgeries , all of which would be performed at no cost to him			1
@entity84 said he does n't know whether @entity9 ' deformities were a result of poor prenatal care or genetics because so little is known about his family 's medical history			0
' all i knew was here was another young human being who was absolutely not accepted by society and was totally down and out , ' he told the @entity37			2
the doctors removed 20 millimeters of bone between his eyes , rebuilt his forehead and created a new nose with excess skin , @entity84 said			1
happy now : in this july 31 , 2013 photo , @entity59 gets a hug from @entity138 , 3 , of @entity139 while his wife , @entity140 , looks on before services at @entity142 in @entity139 , @entity143 as his face began to change @entity9 ' taught himself @entity145 by reading bibles in @entity145 and @entity88 side by side and landed his first job at the @entity150 in @entity83			1
@entity9 later would meet his future wife , @entity151 , in church			2
the couple now live in @entity139 , 30 minutes outside @entity83			1
' he 's my inspiration , ' she said			0
but even as his appearance improved , something was missing			0
' it was awesome to see the change in my face , ' he said , ' but inside â€” the inside was n't changed			2
' one day he started praying along with a religious sermon on tv , and found it helped			2
he found strength in his newfound faith			2
after many years , he was able to forgive his grandmother , his community and himself			0
now , once a month , he gives a sermon in @entity88 at @entity142 about the importance of forgiveness and posts inspirational messages daily on his @entity175 page			0
' he 's very enthusiastic , ' said @entity177 pastor @entity176			0
' he loves to pray for people			0
he 's very sensitive in the spirit			0
' glancing into the mirror , his black hair perfectly in place and his smile wide , @entity9 joked : ' man , i 'm so handsome			2
' but his appreciation for the incredible chance he was given to change his life is no joke			2
' i 'm living in a dream			0
it 's a long dream i have n't woken up from ... i 'm blessed , ' he said .			0
