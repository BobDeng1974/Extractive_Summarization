@entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was on a canal boating holiday in @entity10 with her family when she saw the 10 - year - old boy fall into the ice cold water			1
the boy - known only as @entity14 - was walking along the deck of a narrow boat when he slipped and fell in to the canal			1
brave : @entity6 was on a canal boating holiday when she saw the boy fall into the water @entity6 , who is a pupil at @entity22 , heard the boy 's screams and immediately dived into the cold murky water and swam across to help him			1
she grabbed hold of the boy and held his head above water until family members arrived to help			1
courageous : @entity6 held the boy 's head above water until help arrived @entity6 told an online news website : ' i heard a scream and ignored it at first as there were children playing nearby , but when i heard a second scream i realised somebody was in trouble			1
' i ran over to the side of the boat and saw @entity14 bobbing around in the water screaming he was going to die			2
' i put my hand out but he would n't grab it - he was panicking too much - so i jumped in and just kept him afloat			0
' i 'm quite a good swimmer as i go swimming twice a week so i was n't too worried about the cold water , all i remember is me and him grabbing the boat to try and keep ourselves above the water			2
' i was really just concentrating on stopping him from drowning			0
' @entity6 's mum , @entity52 , said she was proud of her daughter and was on hand to make sure the youngsters were warmed up with a cup of hot chocolate after the rescue			2
she said : ' i ran across after i heard screams and saw them both in the water but i could n't get them out , i literally had to tow them to the front of the narrow boat which allowed us to pull them back up to the deck			1
' we dried them both off and gave them a hot chocolate to drink			0
@entity72 , headmaster of @entity22 , described @entity6 's actions as ' remarkable ' and the pupil was praised during her school assembly			2
he said : ' @entity6 had n't told anyone at school about what she had done			0
proud : @entity6 with her mum @entity79 at the spot where she jumped in and rescued the boy ' we are very proud of her and she obviously used common sense during the rescue , with no one around to help she jumped in with no thought for her own safety			1
' she must have been confident in her ability before she went in to keep @entity14 afloat			0
' we are all just so proud of her doing that in an icy cold canal it 's remarkable			0
' we have talked to the children this morning in assembly about what she did and she should be given some recognition for this , she 's a lovely little girl			0
