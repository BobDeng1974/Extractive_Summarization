by @entity0 @entity1 has attempted to paint @entity3 ’s humiliating flop in @entity4 as a positive experience for the players who bid to avoid a third straight @entity8 defeat on tuesday when they face @entity9			1
the 24 - year - old started both of @entity3 's group games in central midfield , but could not prevent 2 - 1 defeats at the hands of @entity16 and @entity17			1
but the @entity19 star has tried to put a positive spin on the @entity3 ' struggles , believing that their @entity4 voyage has not been a totally futile exercise			2
i ’m sure everyone at home is feeling down			0
' we feel as though we have let a lot of people down , but at the same time we have shown people how well we can play in a big tournament with young players coming through			2
‘ we went out and played with no fear			0
we have a promising young side , hopefully we can gel together and in the future have many more happy memories			0
long walk : @entity1 trudges off the pitch with rising star @entity50 and @entity51 big hope : @entity1 looking on as @entity54 trains with @entity3 ahead of @entity9 game ‘ it does n’t really get much bigger than playing in the @entity25			1
it ’s been an unbelievable experience , but no matter whether we ’ve had highs or lows , you have to learn from it as best you can			0
‘ i ’m sure the young lads here will learn from that and it will make them stronger and better as well			0
’ @entity3 are out after two games ; the first time they have failed to progress beyond the group stage of the @entity25 since 1958 , and their shortest campaign since 1950 .			1

@entity1 tries to put positive spin on @entity3 's @entity25 failure

worst *performance* at a @entity25 since last group stage exit in 1958
