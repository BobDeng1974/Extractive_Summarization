@entity9 worker @entity1 , 26 , persuaded @entity10 and @entity11 to give him their cash card after promising to protect them from fraud			1
@entity1 then took money from the couple , who he had advised for years , when they received a £ 200,000 inheritance from mr @entity21 's mother			1
@entity1 , who had worked for the bank for ten years and earned a £ 26,000 salary , told them he was paying their bills , managing their cash and paying into a funeral plan for them			1
instead he spent £ 36,000 on roulette machines and bets on horse racing at a @entity34 store yards from the branch he was working at in @entity36 , southwest @entity37			1
@entity1 also made cash withdrawals totalling £ 68,000 and £ 3,000 of credit card purchases , as well as applying for thousands of pounds of loans			1
he was finally caught when other cashiers noticed suspicious activity on the @entity44 's account			2
when he was arrested , he tried to claim the @entity45 had blown the money themselves on an extravagant lifestyle			2
he later admitted fraud and was jailed at the @entity49 for what judge @entity50 described as a ' deliberate and mean - minded ' scam			2
judge @entity50 said : ' you deliberately targeted the account and therefore the very modest income of a thoroughly decent couple who had reposed a high degree of trust in your handling of their financial affairs			2

he blew their money on bets and roulette machines and then tried to blame the couple for leading an extravagant lifestyle @entity1 , pictured at the @entity49 , gained the trust of the couple and then used their money to fund his gambling addiction ' they relied on your professional acumen and advice to a significant degree given their learning difficulties and obvious lack of familiarity with the complexities of managing an account in a time of fiscal constraint and uncertainty			1
' the @entity45 have been refunded by @entity9 and the judge said the bank should be commended for this			1
but he added : ' that financial loss is perhaps less significant to them than the undoubtedly shocking effect upon them of learning that the man in whom they had so completely placed their trust over a period of years had disgracefully abused that trust to such an extent			0
' the court heard mrs @entity11 , in her 50s , had learning difficulties and poor eyesight , while mr @entity21 , in his 60s , also had ' below average ' intelligence			0
both worked part - time in a poppy factory			0
prosecutor @entity113 said : ' they are physically quite frail as well			0
' but mr and mrs @entity11 have always endeavoured to live as an independent couple as best they can , although they do receive support in the community			0
' their main aim is to try and avoid being thought of as stupid			0
' they believed bank employees were not only trustworthy but able to assist them in organising their financial affairs			0
' their trust was shattered on june 29 last year when they went to @entity9 to withdraw money			2
' they explained they needed more than the £ 200 cash mr @entity1 had allowed them to cover the period he was away on holiday , ' said ms @entity113			1
' they did n't have their cash card as mr @entity1 held them , he said to protect them from fraud			1
' @entity139 did a check and saw £ 300 had been withdrawn earlier that day through an atm			0
' there was a pattern of recent withdrawals in sums of hundreds of pounds			0
@entity1 worked as cashier at the @entity9 branch in @entity36			1
the bank has refunded the money to the couple @entity1 spent tens of thousands gambling on roulette machines ( right ) and horse racing at the @entity154 ' when asked , the @entity45 said it was probably hissan			1
they refused to believe anything could be amiss with their accounts			0
' such was their trust that they actually telephoned him that evening			0
' further investigation showed huge amounts of money had gone missing since march 2011 , with a large chunk spent on gambling			2
mr @entity21 said he had only ever bet £ 5 on a horse race and £ 4 on the @entity169 song contest			2
when he was arrested , @entity1 claimed the @entity45 had spent the money themselves , telling police they ate out at restaurants three times a day			1
he later owned up , but claimed he had been trying to support his family after his father was laid off			0
@entity175 , defending , said : ' he is perhaps not a callous or devious man but a man who lost control of his finances and turned in desperation to criminal activity			0
' he is thoroughly ashamed of himself , as he ought to be			0
