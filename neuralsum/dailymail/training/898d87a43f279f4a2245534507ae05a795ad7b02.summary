@entity0 moved a step closer to burying their 55 - year @entity3 hoodoo when they grabbed a goal in each half to beat @entity7 2 - 0 on monday and set up a final against @entity9 or @entity10			1
@entity11 gave the @entity0 the lead with a 20th minute header and defender @entity14 lashed the second into the net five minutes after the break as the @entity17 reached the final for the first time since 1988			1
@entity7 , perhaps emotionally and physically drained by their dramatic quarter - final victory over @entity22 last week , played with plenty of passion but were unable to become the first side to breach the @entity17 defence			2
@entity11 celebrates after opening the scoring against @entity7 in the @entity3 semi-final @entity14 ( 19 ) fired home the second to seal @entity0 's place in the @entity3 final @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity33 ; @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity14 ; @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 93 ) ; @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 46 ) , @entity43 ( @entity45 - @entity44 81 ) ; @entity47 - @entity46 substitutes not used : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity55 - @entity54 scorers : @entity46 20 , @entity14 50 booked : @entity38 , @entity35 , @entity37 @entity7 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity57 ; @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 64 ) ; @entity65 , @entity66 ( @entity67 77 ) , @entity68 ( @entity69 63 ) ; @entity70 substitutes not used : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 referee : @entity80 their hopes of another fairytale run to the title - to match their 2007 triumph - were washed away in the @entity88 rain and it 's the two - time champions @entity0 who will return to @entity9 next saturday in search of a first @entity3 crown since 1960			1
@entity0 had looked the most likely to score in a cagey opening to the match with @entity40 , the two - goal hero of @entity0 's quarter - final victory over @entity96 , drawing a fingertip save out of @entity57 with a long - range effort			1
just a minute later , the @entity99 were in front , @entity37 curling a free - kick into the box and @entity42 rising above the @entity104 defence to head down and into the net			2
@entity7 skipper @entity70 was making his presence felt up front but the @entity99 are a side not easily bullied at the back and he was more often than not battling alone in the first half			0
even the persistent rain that fell on @entity88 all day was not able to dampen the spirits of a noisy crowd of just over 36,000 , the @entity17 at one end with inflatable batons and the band of @entity104 at the other accompanied by drums and whistles			0
the @entity99 had more to shout about but @entity7 gave their supporters a lift - following a flurry of attacks just before the break - when winger @entity124 's raking drive forced @entity33 to get down low to push the ball across his goal			2
the @entity17 goalkeeper almost gifted the @entity104 an equaliser when he rashly charged out of his area three minutes after the break , but just two minutes later , his side doubled their lead			0
@entity0 can boast the meanest defence in the competition , having yet to concede a goal @entity7 were unable to recreate the fairytale of 2007 when they won the @entity3 for the first time in their history the @entity99 will play either the hosts @entity9 or the @entity10 in the final on saturday @entity7 's @entity59 and @entity0 's goalkeeper @entity33 compete for the ball @entity14 is congratulated by his team - mates after scoring @entity0 's second goal @entity104 players attempt to rescue a pitch invader after he was tackled by security officials the ball bounced around the area in an extended bout of aerial ping - pong from a @entity40 corner , before @entity11 chested the ball down for @entity14 to hit it first time from the edge of the box past the despairing dive of @entity57			1
@entity7 were forced to press forward but clear - cut opportunities were still few and far between for them , while @entity57 had to be at his sharpest to deny long - range efforts from @entity17 skipper @entity38 and son inside a minute			0
@entity65 continued to cause problems with his pace but there always seemed to be a @entity17 foot or head to cut out the final ball and prevent a scoring chance			0
@entity65 ca n't hide his disappointment after @entity7 were knocked out of the @entity3 in the semi-finals @entity17 players celebrate their semi-final victory with their fans in the pouring rain @entity104 supporters braved the torrential rain to cheer on their team during the semi-final clash			0

@entity0 's @entity11 and @entity14 scored the goals to book their place in the final of the @entity3
the @entity99 have yet to concede a goal in the competition
@entity187 's side will face either @entity9 or the @entity10
@entity0 moved closer to ending their 55 - year @entity3 hoodoo
