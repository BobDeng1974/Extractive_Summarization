by @entity0 published : 10:37 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 13:59 est , 24 april 2013 victim : @entity2 , aged 23 months , died hours after her mother @entity3 had flown to @entity4 a 23 - month - old girl was beaten to death by her mother 's boyfriend who then took to @entity10 to construct an alibi for what he had done , a court heard today			1
@entity2 died from a ' devastating ' brain injury inflicted by @entity15 , 21 , just hours after her mother had flown out to @entity4 to celebrate her 21st birthday , the jury were told			1
afterwards he allegedly altered a @entity10 post to make it look like the girl had banged her head on the floor in @entity24			1
the girl 's mother , @entity3 , was only in the @entity27 with her father for a matter of hours before she was told that her child had been seriously injured			1
the court heard that @entity15 dialled 999 in the early hours of march 10 last year to say that @entity2 had fallen down the stairs at her home in @entity34 , @entity35			1
she died the next day in @entity36 but it emerged that she had also suffered extensive bruising and retinal haemorrhaging			1
@entity35 @entity40 was told that a post-mortem examination concluded the injuries were non-accidental and they would have been inflicted while the defendant was looking after @entity2			1
@entity2 's mother flew to @entity27 on march 9 while @entity15 , her boyfriend of 16 months , was left to look after the child in their terraced home			1
the girl was later due to be passed on to her grandmother			0
@entity50 , prosecuting , said : ' the trip was due to last five days			0
she had only been in @entity4 for a matter of hours when she received news that @entity2 was very ill in hospital			1
in fact she was being kept alive on a life support machine			0
' @entity2 had been left in the sole care of @entity15			1
it is the prosecution 's case that within 24 hours of being in sole charge the defendant had beaten her to death			1
' the court heard that @entity2 had no visible injuries or bruises by 3.30pm on march 9 after @entity15 had taken her to the family gp because she had a cough and cold			1
but by 5pm he told a relative that @entity2 had banged her head walking into a door at the town 's @entity74 's restaurant			1
' attack ' : @entity2 , 23 , died after allegedly being attacked by her mother 's boyfriend in this street in @entity34 , @entity35 @entity79 say this was a lie which was ' carefully contrived and extensive in its execution '			1
he went on to put up a photograph of @entity2 on his @entity10 page with the caption : ' aaah my little princess with a bang on the head at @entity24			1
now she is saying naughty door			0
loved today spending quality time with my little princess			2
going to bath her and put her to bed , missing @entity3 loads			0
' but the day after @entity2 's death he was said to have changed the @entity10 status to say ' aaah my little process when she banged her head on the floor at @entity24 and said naughty floor '			1
shortly before 12.30am on march 10 he rang emergency services to say @entity2 had fallen down the stairs at their home			1
paramedics arrived to find her lying on a bed in the upstairs bedroom , the jury was told			0
' one of the paramedics thought it strange that she had been carried back up the stairs , ' said miss @entity114			0
' her breathing rate was slowing , she was very pale and had a blue tinge to her skin			0
' she was in a very sick and critical condition			0
' the defendant said he had left the stair gate open by mistake , the court heard			2
his behaviour at the hospital , says the prosecution , ' seemed somewhat strange '			2
miss @entity114 said : ' he seemed only to be concerned about his own welfare			0
he was heard to say " i 'm scared , they are going to do me for this "			0
' he failed to apologise to what had apparently happened to @entity2 in his care			2
' @entity15 moved in with @entity132 within weeks of meeting her in november 2011 and at first appeared to bond with her daughter , the prosecutor said			2
' he taught her to call him daddy , ' she said			0
' soon he began to refer to her as ' daddy 's little girl '			0
' but he would also ' engage in cruel behaviour towards her ' such as holding her upside down by her ankle to ' toughen her up ' and picking up one end of a sofa by surprise as she sat on it			0
by february 2012 @entity148 did not want to play with him , the court heard			0
on one occasion it was said he stormed out of the house when she would not say goodbye to him as he left for a trip to @entity154			2
' in his absence when asked if she wanted to see him again she said no , ' said miss @entity114			0
the prosecutor said that a pathologist , a neuropathologist and an eye specialist had later all agreed the injuries to the head and body were non-accidental			2
those injuries were considered to be a strong indication of traumatic head injuries , possibly including vigorous shaking , the jury was told			2
extensive bruising to the face , head and limbs were also consistent with prodding or nipping having taken place			2
miss @entity114 said : ' the pathologist 's conclusion is that the only credible explanation for the head and brain injuries is that @entity2 had been forcibly and repeatedly punched and also possibly slapped across the head			1
the trial is scheduled to last up to two weeks			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
