psychiatrist dr @entity0 has detailed how he helped seven people die in the last two years a @entity3 doctor told yesterday how he helped seven people to die at suicide clinics including @entity5 – only one of whom had a terminal illness			1
over the past two years , psychiatrist dr @entity0 has provided the medical reports which the seven needed to end their lives			1
his assessments , stating the patients were mentally alert enough to know what they were doing , were accepted by @entity15 assisted dying clinics even though dr @entity0 was struck off the @entity3 medical register eight years ago			1
the 73 - year - old is the first doctor to speak so openly about how he helped people to die			2
his revelations , in a book he has co-edited , called i ’ll see myself out , thank you , will horrify opponents of assisted suicide			2
supporters argue people with terminal illnesses should be allowed to opt to die before disease ravages their body or mind			0
but if dr @entity0 ’s account is typical , it suggests only a small proportion of those choosing to end their lives this way are terminally ill. among the seven people were @entity39 , a former businesswoman in her nineties , who lived in severe pain that could not be diagnosed or treated			1
a man in his sixties called @entity45 , a retired professional , was going blind and wanted to die before he lost his sight			2
then there was @entity48 , in his eighties and with early @entity50 , and @entity51 , a @entity53 chairman with @entity50 ’s , who wanted to die before she had to leave her home			0
speaking about @entity55 , a retired academic in his seventies who suffered arthritis , heart disease and high blood pressure , dr @entity0 said : ‘ it sounds no worse than in most people of his age			1
but he dreaded the possibility of a sudden deterioration … that would deprive him of the mental capacity to decide on the manner of his death			0
’ the only one of the seven with a terminal illness was @entity73 , who had motor neurone disease and was told he had less than a year to live			0
an exterior view of the @entity15 assisted dying clinic , @entity76 , where mr @entity0 provided medical reports to in the book dr @entity0 writes : ‘ in the last year or two , i have carried out psychiatric assessments for a few people who were planning to go to @entity15 for medically assisted rational suicide			1
‘ nearly all these people had led lives that marked them out as exemplary and high - achieving … they wanted deaths that matched their lives , with a minimum of pain … but also well - organised , civilised , considerate of others , not too long and , above all , dignified			0
’ in about three other cases , dr @entity0 raised doubts about whether a patient was mentally fit to make the decision , he told @entity93			1
in 2006 , he was struck off by the @entity94 for inappropriate drug prescribing , including heroin substitutes to his addiction patients			1
he is not allowed to practise as a doctor in the @entity3			0
@entity99 , director of public prosecutions , recently said she was less likely to prosecute doctors assisting in the death of patients not under their direct care			0
critics say mr @entity0 has exploited this			0
a spokesman for campaign @entity107 said the main doctors ’ groups ‘ vigorously oppose ’ changing assisted dying laws			2
he said the @entity112 argues suicidal people need support and ‘ not the keys to the drugs cabinet ’ .			0

dr @entity0 was struck off for inappropriate drug prescribing in 2006
despite this assisted dying clinic @entity120 accepted his assessments
he said the seven were mentally alert enough to make the decision
the psychiatrist has also *claimed* to have helped five others die
revelations are *contained* in a book called , ' i *'ll* see myself out , thank you '
