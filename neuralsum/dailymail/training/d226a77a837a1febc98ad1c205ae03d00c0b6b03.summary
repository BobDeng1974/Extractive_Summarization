swimmers are at risk of being attacked in @entity4 waters by killer grey seals , a new report has warned			1
the large carnivorous mammals have been blamed for a spate of mysterious mutilations of harbour porpoises in the @entity10			1
many of the carcasses were washed up on @entity14 shores frequented by human bathers who may also be endangered by attacks from the vicious predators			1
warning : @entity18 seals are being blamed for a spate of mysterious mutilations of harbour porpoises in the @entity10			1
the grey seal 's preferred diet is mostly fish , and it had never been previously known to hunt harbour porpoises			1
the @entity4 is home to more than 180,000 grey seals , more than a third of the world 's population , with about 90 per cent around @entity29			1
now tell - tale @entity30 found in fatal , sharp - edged wounds on porpoises around the southern @entity10 has revealed a dark side to the creatures			1
experts say the seals probably first grab their victims with their heavily armed beaks , before tearing off large sections of the calorie rich blubber			1
the mutilated body of a porpoise shows the fatal wounds believed to have been inflicted by a grey seal evidence from 1,081 autopsies indicates grey seals to be involved in 25 per cent of the cases , showing they are regular porpoise predators and may also have swimmers in their sights			1
the attacks may have been learned behaviour causing by fishing nets			0
the study suggests that grey seals originally scavenged the bodies of porpoises which had become entangled in fishing nets and drowned			1
once getting a taste for them , they then moved on to hunting the animals , and may soon be hunting humans , said the researchers			1
‘ most of the porpoises are juvenile , so they were very small , ’ @entity64 , a senior research fellow , @entity66 and @entity67 at @entity68 told @entity69 ‘ seals are very nippy underwater			2
here in the south we have evidence of them catching salmon in the sea			0
they are quite fast and the thought is the seals moved from scavenging to attacking young porpoises			2
’ many of the porpoises targeted had thin blubber and lots of parasites			2
although they can move faster than seals , they often rest at the sea surface			0
they may have been ambushed by the seals , and been too weak to react fast enough			0
grey seals are also very territorial , and despite their cuddly reputation can be vicious creatures			1
their usual diet consists of fish , crabs , squid , and at times sea birds			0
they grab onto their prey using claws on their front flippers while ripping into skin and flesh with their teeth			0
this same feeding style would have caused the injuries seen on the porpoises			0
mr @entity64 said it is ‘ extremely unlikely ’ grey seals would attack humans given how they interact with divers			2
he also does n’t believe this type of behaviour would extend to the common seal , who is smaller			0
biologist dr @entity119 , of the @entity120 at @entity121 in @entity122 , said : ' we show a substantial proportion of harbour porpoises that stranded on the @entity14 coast were mutilated by grey seals			1
' we also conclude most cases involved active killing and only a small proprtion can be attributed to post mortem scavenging			0
' this makes predation by grey seals one of the main causes of death in harbour porpoises currently stranding in @entity14			1
' photographs of the dead porpoises showed chunks of skin , blubber and muscle ripped out , puncture wounds on the head and broken jaws , revealing the ferocity of the attacks			1
acute haemorrhages indicated the wounds were inflicted during life , just before death			0
partly digested prey in the stomachs showed they had recently fed. the attacks may have been learned behaviour caused by fishing nets			0

the harbour porpoise 's wounds ( pictured ) are thought to be caused by the seals ' sharp beaks and claws the researchers believe their estimate of grey seal attacks on porpoises is ' probably conservative '			1
they say mutilated carcasses with an open stomach or throat wound usually sink rapidly , so can go unrecorded			0
animals that initially escaped an attack may also have died later from wounds inflicted			0
dr @entity119 said : ' the porpoise population may suffer in ways other than loss of individuals as most of the mutilated animals were healthy and fat prior to the attack suggesting grey seals primarily target juvenile harbour porpoises that are in prime condition and so probably reduce recruitment to breeding age			1
' the first grey seal victim was found in 2003 , but without accurate information from earlier years it is not known when or why the behaviour first occurred			2
bodies of the porpoises have been washing up on beaches in the @entity14 ( pictured ) that are popular with swimmers bodies of mutilated carcasses have washed up on the popular @entity14 island of @entity247 ( pictured ) , just north of @entity248 a grey seal stalks the waters of @entity251 , in @entity252 , @entity29			1
the predators are now thought to be responsible for widespread predation of harbour porpoises in the @entity10 dr @entity119 added : ' many of the mutilated porpoises were found on @entity14 shores used frequently by human bathers and surfers and there would appear to be no reason why humans may not be at risk from grey seal attacks			1
' the harbour porpoise , one of the smallest marine mammals at just over six feet long , is not under threat of extinction			2
there are about 350,000 in the @entity10 , half the world 's population			1
grey seals can reach a length of up to 11 feet and a weight of more than 660lbs ( 300 kilograms )			2
they can outweigh a harbour porpoise by a factor of four or more .			0

experts discover grey seals are mutilating and killing harbour porpoises
they use their sharp beaks to catch the porpoises and tear them apart
*ravaged* carcasses are being found on the shores of @entity14 beaches
pictures show porpoise bodies with chunks of skin and blubber ripped out
seals may originally scavenged the bodies of porpoises caught in nets
once getting a taste , they may have moved on to hunting the creatures
researchers believe the seals could also be a danger to swimmers
@entity4 is home to 180,000 grey seals - a third of the world 's population
