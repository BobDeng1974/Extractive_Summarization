by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:52 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 14:59 est , 16 january 2014 it is a culinary scandal which has gone right to the top of the political food chain and left @entity6 with a rather sour taste in his mouth			0
but the @entity10 mayor may find his first crisis in office a little easier to swallow knowing that it will eventually help those most in need			1
in an incident dubbed @entity17 , @entity6 provoked mock outrage after being caught eating his pizza with a knife and fork instead of with his hands as is the @entity10 way			1
now the owner of the @entity24 where he was pictured has kept hold of said fork and plans to auction it for charity			2
scroll down for @entity29 put a fork in him : @entity6 earned the disapproval of @entity10 when he ate a slice with a knife and fork at @entity36 , @entity37 @entity38 , a retired @entity39 sergeant , placed the fork in an evidence bag he acquired from a former colleague and is proudly displaying it behind the bar			1
he told dnainfo.com : ' i just did it because i thought it was funny			0
' then all of a sudden it got all this interest , so i thought let 's do something , let 's do something for charity			0
' it 's not clear when the utensil will go up for auction or which charity will benefit			0
fewer than 10 days into his term as mayor , @entity6 found himself on the defensive after a picture of him using utensils spread across @entity65 , prompting mock outrage among on blogs and news sites			1
responding to the pizza palaver , @entity6 said that his @entity71 ancestry is behind his decidedly @entity73 - eating style			1
' in my ancestral homeland it is more typical to eat with a fork and knife			1
and i have been in @entity79 a lot and @entity82 € ™ ve picked up the habit for certain types of pizza , ' he said			2
hand it to him : @entity6 did eventually pick up his slice it 's a method @entity10 have variously described as ' blasphemous , ' a ' cardinal sin , ' and ' unacceptable ' on @entity65			1
as any @entity10 knows , the preferred method for eating a slice of pizza is to fold it in half and eat it with your hands			1
the incident , already dubbed ' @entity17 , ' happened at @entity37 pizza joint goodfellas last friday , where @entity6 stopped in for lunch with local business owners			2
proving he is not a complete heathen , though , @entity6 explained that he likes to use his hands too			0
his method is a combination of the @entity71 and @entity10 styles , he said , describing it as ' very complicated			1
' ' i often start with a knife and fork			2
but then i cross over to the @entity113 approach and pick it up when i go farther into the pizza , ' he told a reporter who questioned his methods , adding that the inquiry was a ' very important question			2
' @entity120 witnessed the incident and is not letting his longstanding friendship with the mayor get in the way of what 's right			0
one of us : conservative pals @entity127 and @entity129 made news in 2011 when they stepped out of @entity127 's presumably gold - plated apartment in @entity127 tower for a slice of pizza and proceeded to use a knife and fork the @entity113 way : both @entity138 and @entity139 would win approval from @entity10 with their pizza approach he told the @entity143 he loved having @entity6 in his home borough but could not approve of his genteel pizza - eating			1
' no , ' he told @entity143			0
' no. it 's blasphemy			0
' relenting a little , he added , ' he 's from @entity148			0
he does n't know any better			0
' for the record , @entity6 ate three slices of smoked mozzarella and sausage pie .			0
