by @entity0 published : 12:07 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 19:46 est , 11 march 2014 at least one in every 20 prisoners is from the gipsy , @entity6 or traveller communities , a report reveals			1
with 4,276 prisoners in @entity9 and @entity10 being from these groups , they total 5 per cent of the jail population			1
it means there are as many gipsies , @entity6 and travellers in our jails as there are women			0
the report , entitled ' people in @entity23 : gypsies , @entity6 and @entity25 ' was commissioned to help understand the experiences of particular groups in the prison system the figures are higher among youth offenders			1
around 12 per cent of all inmates aged 12 to 18 in prisons known as @entity33 are gipsies , @entity6 or travellers			0
the study , by @entity36 , concluded that people from these backgrounds are ‘ significantly over-represented in prison ’			1
it called for ‘ comprehensive monitoring ’ of the number of prisoners from the groups to understand why so many are behind bars			1
‘ the reasons for this over-representation lie outside the prison service and more needs to be done to understand and address this , ’ the report said			1
the @entity36 added that its prediction of total numbers is likely to be an underestimate			1
the report was commissioned to help understand the experiences of particular groups in the prison system			1
it finds that many from the three groups have a ‘ mistrust ’ of the police and the justice system , because they think it is designed to help ‘ permanently settled communities ’			2
around five per cent of prisoners identified themselves as @entity71 in the national prison survey			2
there are around 85,000 inmates in @entity9 and @entity10 , giving an estimated total of 4,276 behind bars they cite evidence that gipsy offenders are more likely to be given a prison sentence and be remanded in custody because they do not have a permanent address and because of fears that they may abscond			2
the 2011 census included 58,000 people who identified themselves as gipsy or traveller			0
however , it did not survey for @entity6 and the census has struggled to track travellers			0
in april 2012 , the @entity90 reported on a gang of gipsy pickpockets , the @entity94 family , who stole from at least 185 commuters on late night trains leaving @entity98 and used the cash to build five mansions in @entity101			0
there are around 85,000 inmates in @entity9 and @entity10			0
the population of women prisoners is nearly 4,000			1
in the report , prisoners were asked to identify themselves as gipsy , @entity6 or traveller			2
the report says the word gipsy refers to @entity6 groups from @entity112 who settled in @entity9 in medieval times and lived nomadic lives			0
@entity6 or @entity6 speak the @entity117 language or did so in the past , while traveller refers to communities including @entity120 , @entity10 and @entity122 travellers who live nomadically			0
the definition includes ‘ occupational travellers ’ such as ‘ showpeople ’ and ‘ new travellers ’			2
@entity127 was praised in the report for celebrating ‘ @entity133 and @entity134 ’ and giving more telephone credit to gipsy prisoners to help pay for phone calls to their families			1
a @entity136 spokesman said : ‘ we are committed to ensuring fair and equal treatment for all prisoners			0
‘ as part of this , we recently launched a campaign to encourage and support gipsy , traveller and @entity6 prisoners to declare their heritage and address some of the sensitive issues affecting them and their communities			0
‘ since the start of this , we have seen a 50 per cent increase in declarations			0

there are about as many gypsies in jail as there are women prisoners
figures for young offenders are even more stark
study by @entity36 says reasons for this lie ' outside of prison service '
@entity127 was praised in report for celebrating ‘ @entity133 and @entity134 ’
