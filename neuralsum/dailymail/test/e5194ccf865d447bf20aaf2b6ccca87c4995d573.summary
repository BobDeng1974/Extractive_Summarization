@entity0 put @entity2 's top clubs on alert on wednesday by confirming that he will leave @entity4 at the end of the season after seven years in charge			1
@entity0 was immediately installed as the bookmakers ' favourite to replace @entity10 at @entity11 , although it is understood that the struggling @entity14 champions have no plans to make such a move			1
the colourful 47 - year - old coach has been linked with several other @entity2 teams in the past , including @entity19 and @entity20 , and has a long - standing interest in working here			0
@entity0 confirmed in a press conference he is to leave @entity4 this summer an emotional @entity0 said he believed @entity4 need a change of manager next season @entity0 will officially cease to be @entity4 manager on june 30 as he looks for a fresh start elsewhere @entity0 has enjoyed seven largely successful years in charge at the @entity29 the emotion was clear to see as @entity0 announced he was leaving the club on wednesday @entity0 leaves the press conference after confirming his departure as @entity4 boss in the summer @entity0 was alongside chief executive @entity35 ( left ) and sporting director @entity36 ( right ) after the press conference , @entity0 joined the @entity4 squad for a training session @entity0 speaks to the players in training , shortly after making the announcement he would be leaving the club @entity4 are preparing for their home @entity44 match with @entity46 at the weekend @entity0 issues instructions to his defender @entity48 during wednesday 's training session @entity0 , wearing a club tracksuit and baseball cap , cuts a lonely figure on the training ground a downcast @entity0 during @entity4 's 3 - 1 loss to @entity55 at the weekend man city – the @entity14 champions are unlikely to deviate from their top target @entity59 as speculation continues to surround @entity10 's future – 3/10 @entity19 – @entity0 has been linked with the @entity63 job on previous occasions but @entity65 has come through a difficult spell and appears to be safe – 5/10 @entity20 – with the @entity68 on course for second place and the chance to retain the @entity72 , it would be a surprise if they looked to replace @entity74 now – 4/10 @entity75 – @entity0 has appeared on @entity75 's radar before and could do so again despite their intense rivalry with @entity4 – 6/10 @entity78 – @entity79 is on thin ice at the @entity81 but @entity0 has said he wants to work at a club where he speaks the language – 6/10 he is among the most highly - rated managers in @entity86 football after winning two @entity44 titles and the @entity88 at the @entity29 , as well as leading @entity4 to the @entity90 final in 2013			1
@entity0 insisted that he has not had any contact with other clubs but confirmed that he is open to offers , denying reports that he will take a sabbatical after a difficult season in which @entity4 have struggled towards the bottom of the table			1
' i am sure that the decision is absolutely right , ' he said at an emotional press conference			0
' this team deserves to have the absolutely one hundred per cent right coach			0
i believe that @entity4 actually needs a change			2
as long as i 'm here , we are always considering the successes of the past			0
' what i have always said in the last few years is that in that moment when i feel i wo n't be the perfect manager for this incredible club then i would say it			1
' i have of course every now and then thought about the topic in past years because it is always important to question yourself			2
i have though in the last weeks and days asked myself if i 'm still the right manager			2
i was n't sure but i could n't answer with a yes			0
' i have had no contact with others clubs , either in @entity2 or elsewhere , but i am not planning a sabbatical			0
' i do n't think of it as a load off my shoulders			0
i 'm not tired , even though i look like this			0
' @entity10 is under pressure at @entity11 but @entity0 is unlikely to replace him at the @entity126 dejected @entity4 players @entity128 , @entity48 , @entity129 and @entity130 after saturday 's loss the season has been one of struggle for @entity4 , who flirted with relegation from the @entity44 april 18 @entity46 ( @entity136 ) april 25 @entity137 ( @entity136 ) april 28 @entity75 ( a ) @entity88 semi-final may 2 @entity138 ( a ) may 9 @entity139 ( @entity136 ) may 16 @entity140 ( a ) may 23 @entity141 ( @entity136 ) sources in @entity143 have not ruled out @entity0 making a controversial move to rivals @entity75 if @entity59 fails to win the @entity90 this season , despite a mutual dislike of the club 's sporting director @entity148 and the risk of tarnishing his reputation with @entity4 supporters			1
that would free up @entity11 's top target guardiola to move to the @entity126 and take over from @entity10 whose future remains uncertain following a disappointing second season in @entity2 football			1
neither will there be any shortage of top @entity86 clubs hoping to lure @entity0 away from @entity143 where he has built an exciting team to challenge @entity75 's dominance			1
having lost @entity165 and @entity166 to their rivals , however , more key players are set to leave this summer including @entity48 and @entity168 who have been linked with a move to @entity170			2
@entity0 shakes hands with @entity20 manager @entity74 before their @entity90 tie in november the news about @entity0 's future will place a number of @entity14 clubs on alert @entity44 2010 - 11 , 2011 - 12 @entity88 2011 - 12 @entity178 2013 , 2014 @entity179 2008 @entity90 runner - up 2012 - 13 @entity143 @entity181 2011 , 2012 @entity182 's record at @entity4 @entity183 309 w 175 d 67 l 67 win % 56.63 @entity0 was under contract until 2018 but his relationship with his squad is believed to have gone stale after so long in charge and only the timing of wednesday 's announcement was unexpected			1
' i believe this is the right decision at the right time , ' he added			0
' i just wanted to make my decision known now so that the club can plan for the future			2
in the last few years , some player decisions were made late and there was no time to react			0
