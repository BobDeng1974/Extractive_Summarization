despite the fact it 's illegal in the @entity2 , at least 65,000 @entity2 girls are at risk of having @entity5 as they are taken out of the country during so called ' cutting season ' aka the school holidays			1
the procedure - which involves having parts of their vagina cut out and then then sewn back together again - is usually performed before a girl turns 12 and is carried out without anesthetic or sterilised equipment			2
many of the girls are too scared to admit they have suffered @entity6 and can be stigmatised by their community for speaking out			1
recalling the moment she was cut , one of the women @entity19 , 32 , from @entity31 , said : ' your whole body is in pain , the scream that you scream meant i lost my voice for a couple of days			2
' the moment your genitals are cut , a part of your soul dies			0
' another @entity2 survivor interviewed for the documentary said : ' i do n't think there 's any word i can use to describe that moment			1
they grab you with a woman holding each leg and another holding your head and chest so you ca n't move			0
' the practice first began in ancient @entity56 and remains a rite of passage in many @entity59 and @entity60 countries and some parts of @entity62			1
parents cut their daughters because they believe that this will allow her to be accepted into society and improve her marriage prospects			2
a girl who is uncut is often seen unclean and sexually promiscuous			2
the idea that @entity6 is necessary and makes a woman more virtuous and attractive is so ingrained in some communities that mothers who have endured it themselves - and continue to live with the physical and mental consequences - will still happily arrange for their daughters to suffer the same fate			1
@entity77 was subjected to @entity6 as a child and said many @entity2 girls are at risk @entity19 explains : ' the cutting season in the @entity2 means holidays			1
if you do n't get this done , you wo n't be married to the right family so your status is questioned			0
' the anonymous victim added : ' it 's a business for the person doing the cutting and the family as once the child has been through @entity6 , whoever they will marry will pay a higher dowry , it 's all about money			1
' actress @entity96 , who presents the @entity98 documentary , flew to @entity99 to meet one of the women making money as a result of cutting thousands of girls who are taken to her from around the world			1
despite suffering the pain of @entity6 herself as a child , the elderly cutter said she 's happy to cut others - using a pair of sharp scissors she carries around in her handbag			1
she said families from across the @entity2 , @entity115 and @entity116 travel to @entity99 for her services			2
the cutter said : ' when i had fgm i was cut with thorns , i can still feel it now			0
then they used thorns to stitch me back up			0
' justifying why she now inflicts this on other girls , she said : ' the girls father gives permission , the mother as well , her whole community gives permission and i get paid			0
' she added why her community believe @entity6 to be so important : ' if the girls are n't cut , they will start to love and start to chase men , they should be cut before they are 12 otherwise they will start to get horny			1
' our tradition is to cut them and make them bleed to calm them down			0
if you do n't cut them , they will think about pleasure all the time , they ca n't help themselves			0
' pleasure has been far from the mind of @entity147 , 23 , a @entity2 resident @entity96 meets who had type 3 fgm when she was a child			2
after she was cut , she was sewn back up with and left with a hole no bigger than matchstick that has left her with a host of health problems - and infertile			1
she said : ' i was seven when i was cut			0
it happened , i was cut and i got this pain every night , abdominal pain			0
' actress @entity96 , right , travelled to @entity99 for a @entity98 documentary to meet @entity161 , left , the founder of @entity26 funded project which helps girls escape @entity6 @entity147 's stomach pains where due to the fact she could n't have a normal period because of the tiny hole she had been left with			1
blood that was supposed to leave her body remained trapped inside causing internal damage			0
she has had a number of operations to try and restore her health and wellbeing but will never be able to have children			0
now married to a man she met in the @entity2 , @entity147 said she feels guilty she will never be able to have a family with the man she loves			2
@entity19 also has to live with the mental as well as physical consequences of her fgm			0
she said : ' i live at home with a panic alarm , i have to carry a personal alarm with me wherever i go , it 's difficult			0
' she added that many people may be surprised to learn she 's a victim of @entity6 because of her western appearance but she said many @entity2 girls like her are at risk			1
she said : ' there 's this code of silence , i associate it with the @entity198			0
we describe ourselves as the " @entity6 " survivors			1
we are @entity202 girls so do n't narrow it to one particular image			2
' the documentary reveals how many are duped into travelling out of @entity2 when they are young as they are told they are going on holiday or to a party			2
@entity77 , 31 , who lives in @entity31 , campaigns against @entity6 after having it done to herself as a child , agreed that the practice is more rife in the @entity2 than people realise			1
she said : ' many are afraid to speak out as there is that fear of being judged			0
everyone thinks it 's not the girl in @entity218 , in @entity219 or @entity31 being taken away and having fgm but it 's exactly these girls , they are not girls who are immigrants or here on holiday			0
@entity96 with some of the children who are being helped by the @entity26 supported project in @entity99 ' they are the girl at the back of your classroom or the girl you could bump into on @entity232 but you do n't know they have just been through @entity6			1
' the documentary reveals the steps that are being taken to try and stop the practice continuing			0
in an @entity31 school , @entity6 workshops are held to educate young men and women on why it 's wrong , while border police operate at airports to try and stop girls they deem to be at risk leaving the country			1
nine new red nose characters , pictured , are available for shoppers to collect in the run up to @entity249 on friday 13th march			0
at least 60p from each £ 1 nose goes to help transform the lives of some of the poorest and most disadvantaged people in the @entity2 and across @entity59			1
@entity254 ’s is the official retailer of @entity255 and @entity256 merchandise @entity96 sees that change is also happening in @entity99 where it has also been made illegal and where education is helping to empower girls and break the cycle of @entity6			1
in @entity262 , @entity99 , where up to 95 per cent of girls have undergone @entity6 in traditional @entity265 tribes , one of the world 's leading @entity268 campaigners , @entity161 , runs a rescue centre for girls who rebel against @entity6			2
the centre gives the girls a safe home , food , clothes and an education			0
@entity26 is supporting their fight against @entity6 as well as those working to end it in the @entity2			1
