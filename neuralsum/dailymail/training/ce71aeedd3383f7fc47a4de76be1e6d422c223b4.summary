by @entity0 published : 10:32 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 07:24 est , 1 may 2013 a huge landslide that saw tens of thousands of tonnes of chalk give way without warning from 120ft cliffs yesterday took place along @entity7			1
the massive section of the cliffs near the beauty spot of @entity11 in @entity12 collapsed and wiped out part of the 630 - mile @entity14			1

collapse : a giant pile of rocks now nearly reaches the height of the cliffs after the slump , turning the turquoise water a powdery white colour the coast path is popular with walkers , but officials have closed off the area and are urging people to stay away for fear of more rock falls			1
the crew of an army safety boat monitoring their nearby firing ranges alerted the coastguard to the landslide yesterday at 8am			1
a spokesman for @entity41 said : ‘ it is quite extraordinary			2
a massive fall has taken out part of the cliff , it is huge			1
' the cliff has broken away right from the top and has left a pile of chalk that is as high as the cliffs			1
there have been several landslides along the coastline recently but this is by far and away the biggest			0
‘ the message is for people to stay away from the area and not to ignore the signs that are going up advising them not to go any further			1
’ meanwhile two ramblers were photographed deciding to walk dangerously close to the edge hours after the slippage yesterday			1
location : a huge section of the cliff near the beauty spot of @entity11 in @entity12 gave way and wiped out part of the 630 - mile @entity14 a @entity71 spokesman said : ‘ what do you think they are doing on the edge of a collapsed cliff ? there 's a reason we give advice			1
’ ' anyone who is tempted to go and have a look must stay away			1
the edge there is still unstable			0
the path is being diverted and signposted ' @entity71 the agency said it was believed that the landslide happened on monday night - and it did not know if anyone had been injured in the incident			1
it added : ‘ anyone who is tempted to go and have a look must stay away			1
the edge there is still unstable			0
the path is being diverted and signposted			0
' please do not go past the sign that says : “ do not go past the sign ”			0
by doing so , you are putting yourself at risk and anyone trying to rescue you			0
’ but a woman claiming to be in the photograph with her son got in touch with @entity105 last night to say she was unhappy with the agency ’s comments			0
ignoring warnings : these ramblers decided to walk dangerous close to the edge of the 120ft cliffs near @entity11 in @entity12 just hours after a slippage she said : ‘ i take exception to the coastguard saying : “ what do you think they were doing on the edge of a collapsed cliff ? ” it is misleading and unfair			1
we , and the other walkers who were there at 10am when the coastguard took the photos , were not aware of the landslip			2
' the coast is eroding and there is not a lot that can be done about it			0
it is something we have to live with ' @entity136 , @entity137 chief geologist ‘ there were no warning notices - the area was not roped off at the time			0
other people in fact were walking much closer to the collapsed cliff			2
' my son and i took a different path because we were not comfortable walking too close to the edge of the cliff , which we all thought was part of the path			2
it 's unfair for the coastguard to imply that we were stupid to walk near a collapsed cliff despite their warning			1
’ yesterday 's landslip is the latest in a series that have changed the face of the protected @entity137			2
earlier this month a pile of chalk boulders , some the size of cars , left the beach to the west of @entity11 blocked off following a fall			1
nearby : the landslide happened close to the beauty spot of @entity11 ( pictured ) in @entity12 , one of the most photographed landmarks along the @entity137 in march , a section of the coast near @entity170 , @entity12 , was effectively split in two after a 150ft long crevasse appeared on the clifftop			1
repeated landslides further along the coast near @entity175 have also led to the demolition of £ 1million of beach chalets that were made unsafe			0
' it is quite extraordinary			0
a massive fall has taken out part of the cliff , it is huge			2
the cliff has broken away right from the top and has left a pile of chalk that is as high as the cliffs ' @entity41 spokesman and last summer , holidaymaker @entity189 , 22 , was tragically killed at @entity190 when 400 tonnes of falling rocks fell on her			2
@entity136 , chief geologist for the @entity137 , said : ‘ today 's ( tuesday 's ) landslip is an exceptionally big rock fall			0
‘ the land along parts of the @entity137 is made up of soft clay rock and when it gets saturated by heavy rain over long periods followed by dry weather like we have had , landslips take place			0
we have also had some big seas recently lapping at the base of the cliffs			2
' so that may have been a factor in what has happened			0
these landslips are taking parts of the coastal path away			0
the coast is eroding and there is not a lot that can be done about it			0
it is something we have to live with			0
that is the reason why the coast is so dramatic and beautiful			0
