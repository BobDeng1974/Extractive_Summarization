by @entity0 published : 12:11 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 12:17 est , 14 november 2013 love them or hate them , @entity2 sprouts are a @entity6 day staple			1
and now one veggie - loving juice company thinks that we should be slurping our sprouts the rest of winter too			1
the @entity11 's first ever @entity2 sprout juice has been launched by @entity13 , going on sale at the exclusive food store @entity15			1
hoping to become this season 's super juice staple , this intriguing health drink promises to deliver lots of health benefits and help keep bugs at bay			1
can you stomach it ? @entity13 have launched the first - ever @entity2 sprout juice and it is available now at luxury store , @entity15 the makers claim the juice offers a ' distinctly clean and punchy way to enjoy the @entity31 super food ' and they 're convinced it will rival the oh - so - virtuous kale in the health stakes			1
sprouts are rich in vitamin c and @entity37 , which helps fight off infection			1
they also contain sulforaphane , which reduces risk from cancer , as well as lowering cholesterol			0
for those hard - core vegetable juice addicts ( yes you , @entity45 ) , the @entity2 sprout can be combined with spinach and kale or enjoyed as a clean shot on its own			1
for the less adventurous foodies , the sprouts can be mixed into a punchy £ 3.95 concoction of pears , cinnamon and spices or apples and cranberry			1
will they dare ? @entity45 ( @entity59 ) and @entity60 are huge super juice fans , but will @entity2 sprout juice become their new health essential ? @entity65 , bartender of cult cocktail bars @entity67 and @entity68 , said : ' the limited edition flavours are perfectly enjoyed on a chilly morning walk to work or to revitalise yourself before another festive party			1
' @entity73 , @entity74 at @entity75 said : ' @entity77 sprouts are a cruciferous vegetable that are packed with vitamin k , vitamin c , folic acid , calcium and magnesium			1
' as a juice i ’d imagine the taste may be very intense , but by adding pear , cinnamon and spice or apples and cranberry would surely improve it			0
combined with spinach and kale it ’d become a super shot of green goodness			1
' if you have thyroid issues , i would n’t have it too often , as @entity2 sprouts are goitrogenic especially when consumed raw , meaning they can interfere with the absorption of iodine , which is essential for thyroid function			1
'' @entity106 from @entity106 's @entity108 food blog , said : ' @entity2 sprouts are considered to be a super food			1
they are packed with numerous vitamins , minerals , antioxidants , and phytochemicals			0
good stuff : @entity2 sprouts provide a good source of vitamin a , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity37 , potassium , manganese , folate acid , iron , glucosinolates , riboflavin , and thiamin ' @entity2 sprouts juice does provide a great source of vitamin a , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity37 , potassium , manganese , folate acid , iron , glucosinolates , riboflavin , and thiamin			1
by juicing @entity2 sprouts , it allows your body to absorb all the nutrients found inside easier than if eaten			1
' many people find that @entity2 sprouts are difficult to digest and cause bloating therefore juicing them is a good alternative ' i do not support the claim that this juice is sure to keep winter infections at bay , it may help if used in combination with a balanced diet			1
stress and lack of sleep also effect our immune system			0
' i saw that you can buy a small shot of @entity2 sprout juice for £ 2.00			2
a typical shot is around 50ml			2
you can buy 1 kg of sprouts for less then £ 2 and make more then 10 shots with a good juicer			2
' it concerns me that we are buying into the premise that juicing is a quick fix to optimising our health where as in fact juices like these are expensive and not a substitute for healthy eating			1
' @entity60 , who has one of showbiz 's most enviable figures , recently praised her ‘ delicious green juice ' which she described as ' a great way to start the day			0
' but what ’s behind this mysterious concoction ? along with other super healthy ingredients such as cucumber , kale and parsley , the @entity181 wholefood @entity182 is added to the juice			0
and it ’s not just @entity60 who ’s caught the @entity190 bug , @entity45 has admitted that she takes @entity192 supplements to keep her skin in check			0
green vegetable smoothie @entity196 , who ’s a nutritionist and green food expert at @entity192 , has shared her tips for the perfect morning smoothie ...			0
' with everyone from @entity60 to @entity202 drinking green smoothies recently , you ’d be forgiven for thinking this is just another beauty fad			0
' we all know that we ’re probably not eating enough greens , yet our greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat , and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy			0
@entity215 smoothies can be high in vitamin @entity216 , which can help reduce tiredness , and magnesium , which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature ’s tranquiliser , helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it ’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it ! you ’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices , to up their nutrient intake even further			1
for instance , a daily serving of the @entity181 wholefood @entity182 contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach ( 270g ) and the same @entity216 content as a 32oz steak			0
perhaps most importantly , these drinks provide large quantities of whole food natural vitamins and minerals and help increase our daily intake of fruit and vegetables – for busy people who still want to remain healthy , this is hugely important			2
smoothies are also full of fibre and water along with a whole range of nutrients which naturally makes us feel fuller which reduces the desire to consume food generally especially sugar and carbohydrates			0
we recommend the @entity260 of blenders , the @entity263 blender , as it breaks down the cell walls of fresh , whole foods to deliver the full benefit of nutrients			0
it also saves time as all of the ingredients can be added at once			0
' @entity45 and @entity60 ’s green juices and smoothies are so nutritious , simply because greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat , and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy			2
combining these into an easy to drink smoothie can help busy people cram as many of these vegetables into their daily diet as possible			2
juicing and blending raw green vegetables and living micro greens ( sprouts ) containing fresh vibrant green chlorophyll are extremely nutritious ways of creating optimum health and energy			1
just juice : @entity60 has revealed that she loves @entity192 ( like those pictured right ) green juices juicing or blending any raw green vegetable , especially the living leafy varieties , is an effective way of increasing oxygen in the body and helping to build healthy tissues			2

@entity215 smoothies containing the ingredients seen in @entity60 and @entity45 ’s can be high in vitamin @entity216 , which can help reduce tiredness			2
the spinach in @entity60 ’s signature smoothie is high in magnesium , which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature ’s tranquiliser , helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it ’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it ! you ’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices , to up their nutrient intake even further			2
for instance , a daily serving of the @entity181 wholefood @entity182 contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach ( 270g ) and the same @entity216 content as a 32oz steak – vitamin d in particular is important for winter , as this nutrient is produced by natural sunlight , and long cold winters can cause @entity334 to become deficient , meaning it ’s important to top up where possible			2
