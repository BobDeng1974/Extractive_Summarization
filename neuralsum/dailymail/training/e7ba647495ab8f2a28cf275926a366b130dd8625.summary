by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:10 pm on 23rd june 2011 an @entity3 user has been banned from selling an inch - high war games model of @entity5 on the grounds that it could be seen as @entity9 propaganda			1
@entity10 , 38 , paints models from war games and sells them around the world on the popular website			2
in the past he has sold other ' hate ' figures including those of @entity17 and the @entity18 without a problem - but when the father - of - three came to sell a tiny model of @entity5 worth just £ 10 @entity3 removed it			1
stunned : @entity10 was amazed to receive a warning from @entity3 after listing a tiny @entity5 figurine and he was ' stunned ' to be told that site regulations do not ' permit members to list items that contain propaganda or memorabilia with @entity9 or @entity30 markings			1
' he also received a warning that if he tried to list similar items in the future they ' may be removed and affect your account negatively "			2
mr @entity10 , an aerospace programmer from @entity37 , @entity38 , said of the decision , ' i quite agree that @entity5 was a horrible individual but if you look at the model there are no @entity30 markings on him			0
' if i painted him blue he could be mistaken for @entity45 from ' @entity46			0
' there are still lots of @entity9 branded products on @entity3 , and if this is their policy they should apply it more thoroughly			1
' and if you are have the good guys you have to have the bad guys too			0
i do n't think i have been treated fairly			0
" mr @entity10 bought the @entity5 model four years ago from an online shop when his son @entity56 , now aged 14 , was studying @entity57 at school			0
it was made by @entity60 which produced a @entity57 range of figures including @entity63 and @entity64			0
he put the model up for sale on @entity3 on june 13 with a £ 2 reserve price , and had already received nine bids before @entity3 removed it six days later with bidding at £ 9			1
@entity3 told him in an email , ' we know it is frustrating to see items removed from the website but people are not allowed to list items that promote or glorify hatred , violence or racial intolerance			1
' tiny dictator : the figurine measured just 28mm in height - and was thought to be worth around £ 10 despite removing mr @entity10 's model from its listings , @entity3 continues to stock other memorabilia including three - inch high figures of @entity5 and @entity88 which are currently available and have attracted bids of up to £ 115			2
mr @entity10 's experience is similar to that of @entity92 who was banned from selling a rare @entity94 board game on @entity3 in january 2010 after it breached their ' offensive material policy '			1
mr @entity92 , of @entity98 , @entity99 , bought the game - suitable for children as young as eight - second hand from a car boot sale for just £ 1 more than 20 years ago			0
he decided to sell the game on @entity3 with a starting price of 99p but received an email from the online giant telling him they were taking it off the site because it could ' promote violence , hatred , racial or religious intolerance '			1
removed from sale : but @entity3 continues to list other similar items of memorabilia the company even suggested a swastika symbol on the board and on the front of the box constituted ' memorabilia associated with the @entity123 ' which breached their offensive material policy			1
mr @entity92 , who came across the game while clearing out his loft , said at the time , ' instead of making a few quid and clearing some space , i 've been made to look like i 'm a racist or @entity9 sympathiser			0
' he accused @entity3 of vetting content on the site ' without looking into anything properly			2
they allow coins and stamps with swastikas and there are hundreds of novels which are war stories that have them			0
it 's ridiculous that they ca n't use common sense ' .			0

@entity146 had *previously* *auctioned* models of @entity17 and @entity18
previous items pulled from @entity3 for same reason include a @entity94 board game
