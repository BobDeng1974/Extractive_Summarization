they were standing 10 - deep at the end of @entity2 , squinting through the afternoon sun as they waited for the riders			1
a @entity7 - language commentary , was jabbering from a nearby loudspeaker , and a big man in the front row was laboriously translating			1
the commentator grew more excited and the interpreter turned to his audience : ‘ he says @entity15 is giving it a real right go , ’ he announced			1
‘ come on @entity15 ! ’ they yelled , as the leaders flashed by			1
his face changed , and he quietened the cheering with his message			2
‘ he ’s crashed , ’ he said			2
‘ he ’s only bloody crashed ! just down the road			2
’ there was a groan which ran down the cul – de – sac , through @entity29 and across the breadth of @entity78			2
on the day the @entity33 came to @entity27 , we had provided our own luckless victim			1
yet even the sight of an hugely accomplished home contender being swept off to hospital could not obscure the essential triumph of the day			2
contrary to blokeish opinion , the @entity85 appreciate other sports beside football			1
consider the @entity90 miracle of the @entity91 , or the ravenous appetite for @entity93 or international rugby			2
recall how the glories of the incomparable 2012 @entity96 held the nation in thrall			2
as a nation , we love an event , and we turn out in dramatic numbers when that event is both significant and accessible			1
few things in sport are as significant or as important as the @entity59			1
bridging the gap : the riders cross a bridge as they make their way over @entity110 flying the flag : the residents of @entity113 were out early to secure the best vantage points as @entity33 passed through their town packed : it was standing room only in @entity29 as thousands of spectators thronged the historic @entity27 town colourful : thousands of fans lined the route of the first leg of the @entity59 here they come : @entity15 and @entity125 lead the @entity126 along the @entity127 in @entity28 at the ceremonial start of the @entity59 @entity129 out : riders in the 101st @entity33 cross the start line in front of thousands of spectators in @entity28 on the 118 - mile first stage to @entity29 any vantage point : it was a scramble to find the best view as the race passed through @entity28 yet there was a moment , somewhere between @entity140 and @entity141 , when it seemed that the @entity33 was no longer a sport , more the fantasy of a romantic director			1
the rain had yielded to brightness , and the moors and dales sprawled languidly to the horizon			2
every cliché was obeyed , from the picture - postcard villages of mellow stone to the sturdy @entity154 churches , the barns bulging with hay and the fluffy clouds wafting across broad blue swathes of sky			2
the whole affair seemed like an adoring advertisement for the glories of @entity27			2
which , to a great extent , it was			0
the @entity166 spoke of the world ’s greatest cycle race coming to the world ’s greatest county			0
@entity171 will not consider that a boast , more a statement of fact			0
sport with a view : early arrivals look out over @entity110 as they wait for @entity33 to pass by absent friend : this message lamented the absence of 2012 winner sir @entity180 from this year 's tour stereotype : two groups of fans dressed as the @entity7 compare outfits teamwork : riders scale the @entity188 on the 190km route from @entity28 to @entity29 no room to move : crowds got up , close and personal with the riders all the way along the route @entity195 : the @entity166 spoke of the world 's greatest cycle race coming to the world ¿ s greatest county @entity200 ? this fan was dressed for the occasion in @entity113 as the @entity203 came to @entity27 for the first time warm @entity27 welcome : the locals picked up some of the @entity7 lingo as @entity33 swept through what a spectacle : the riders race through @entity113 , with the entire town seemingly out to enjoy the occasion delicious ! a fine assortment of homemade cakes on display in @entity113 @entity216 - eyed view : spectators on top of @entity219 in @entity113 await the @entity33 riders inspired : the coming of @entity33 to @entity27 will certainly encourage quite a few to get out on their bikes then there was the small matter of brass , which does not go overlooked here			1
the figure of £ 100 million benefit to the local economy may have been plucked from the air by an ambitious publicist , but it is thought to be close to the truth			1
certainly , the investment has proved hugely successful			0
all the conventions were observed			0
at daybreak in @entity28 , later in @entity29 , and in possibly in every town and village en route , a breakfast television hack could be found pleading with crowds for a spot of raucous enthusiasm : ‘ are we excited about the @entity59 coming to @entity27 ? ’ ‘ @entity242 ! ’ it is the squirming tradition they observe for royal weddings and it ’s a knockout			1
but the response was everything the sport could have wished			1
quite aside from the tumult of town and city , the way in which the crowds closed in on the climbers — urging , cajoling , doing everything short of hauling them to the peak — was every bit as fervent as their cousins in the @entity262			0
these were not curious observers , these were people who understood what they saw			0
just yesterday , sir @entity266 , the @entity267 of the sport in this country , announced his belief that @entity78 is the world ’s premier cycling nation			1
certainly , the public appears to ‘ get it ’ , an underestimated affection which has its roots in the achievements of such as @entity125 and sir @entity180 , and which will increase when the next generation of cyclists states its case			0
but you can discern authentic knowledge , as contenders such as @entity283 of @entity284 , @entity285 of @entity286 and the @entity288 @entity287 are earnestly discussed			0
@entity289 takes historic opening stage they 're coming ! the peloton leaves @entity293 and enters the @entity31 national park in the spirit : this house in @entity293 was decked out in yellow bunting and the flags of @entity7 and @entity78 yellow bloom : this lovely colourful display in @entity293 marked the big race calm before the storm : the scene in @entity293 on the morning of the race celebration : @entity37 @entity21 wins the first stage of the 101st edition of the @entity59 and cycling ’s appeal was easily understood			1
it felt like a unique occasion ; a day which challenged the imagination			0
@entity313 offers few finer sights than that of the peloton unfolding like some exotic insect , writhing its way through @entity319 and @entity320 , @entity321 and @entity322 and a whole litany of place names which have rarely been spoken with @entity326 intonation			0
in truth , the collision of cultures was intriguing : @entity330 meets @entity331			0
organisers were staggered by the numbers which turned out			0
it is estimated that two million will come out to cheer this @entity27 weekend			1
most seem to be wearing yellow jerseys , indeed , only @entity336 has more			0
and their optimism is heartening , but this is @entity27 , and the locals are not easily carried away			0
at breakfast in a @entity28 hotel yesterday , an elderly man noticed me studying the @entity33 handbook			1
‘ you going to the bike race ? ’ he asked			0
‘ where ’s it going ? ’ he inquired			0
i told him of the winding route through moor and dale and the circular tour of @entity27			0
there ’s quicker ways of getting to @entity29 ’ , he said			0
@entity27 may have embraced the @entity33 , but there is still work to be done .			1

contrary to opinion , the @entity85 appreciate other sports beside football
