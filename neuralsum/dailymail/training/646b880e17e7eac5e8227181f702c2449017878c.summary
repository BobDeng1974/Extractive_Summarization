a glamour model has spoken of how her career was shattered in an instant when she was paralysed in a freak accident while out clubbing			2
@entity4 , 40 , from @entity5 , was left in a wheelchair and with severely limited movement in her upper body when a fellow clubber high on drink and drugs fell from a balcony and landed directly on top of her			1
she said : ‘ i did n't want to live at first after being told i would need 24 hour care , using a catheter and being washed and dressed			2
@entity4 , 40 , a former glamour model , was paralysed from the neck down when a man fell from a balcony and landed on top of her in a nightclub in @entity5 in 2004 ‘ but my family said “ let 's fight this until one day you get back on your feet again ”			1
from that day i just thought that is it ! fight it will be ! ’ she is now on a huge fundraising drive to raise funds into spinal research in the hope like people such as her will one day be able to walk again			1
ms @entity4 , who was just 30 at the time , was in a nightclub in @entity37 in 2004 when @entity38 , who had been taking ecstasy and drinking heavily , landed on top of her			1
she says she felt a sudden ‘ thud ’ on her neck and shoulders and fell to the ground as she was hit by the 6ft 3ins man			1
' my initial thought was that i 'd been punched and i remember falling backwards , ' she says			2
' but when i hit the floor i knew something was dreadfully wrong as i could do nothing other than blink			2

' ms @entity4 , who appeared on @entity70 as well a model in various national newspapers , was rushed to @entity73 in south @entity5 , where she underwent six hours of emergency surgery to stabilise her neck			1
she was told her neck had been broken and her spinal cord compressed			1
she told @entity76 : ' i think there was something telling me not to go out that night - i did n't really want to go and my gut feeling was that i should n't			2
' but i did n't want to let my boyfriend down so i went anyway			0
' she added : ' i knew immediately something was terribly wrong when i was lying on the floor			0
' the first thing i asked the paramedics was if i was going to be in a wheelchair but they said it was too soon to say			2
ms @entity4 ( pictured , left , before the accident ) says that when she realised the extent of her injuries she initially thought she did not want to live any more ms @entity4 ( pictured with friends ) now focuses on raising awareness of spinal injuries and on raising money for research into a cure for these injuries ' being in the hospital was daunting - it was like a scene from @entity102			1
i knew by that point that it was quite serious			0

when she arrived at the hospital she was unable to move anything other than her head			0
she said : ' i thought i could n't live like that			0
i thought it was the end of my life			0
' i was not accepting it , i did n't want to hear about it and i was in denial			0
i think most people feel suicidal in that position			0
' ms @entity4 ( pictured in rehabilitation ) says her dream is to eventually walk again and to regain her independence despite the treatment and a strict exercise regime , she only regained some of the movement in her arms and none of the movement in her legs			1
and while she can now move her arms a little , she is still unable to move her wrists or her hands			0

mr @entity38 was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm and was jailed for two years			1
ms @entity4 told @entity76 : ' i do n't let him ruin my life - i do n't think about it			1
he was never really apologetic but i do n't wish bad upon him and i do n't want to be ruined by anger			0
@entity38 , the man who fell on ms @entity4 , was found guilty of causing gbh and was jailed for two years ' i do sometimes wonder what i did to deserve it , you think " why me ? "			1
' i had so many gut instincts telling me not to go out but i ignored them - it happened and there is nothing i can do about that now			0
' she now dedicates her time to raising awareness of spinal cord injuries and to raising money for research into a cure			1
she said : ' my hope and my dream is getting back on my feet and regaining my independence			0
