food poisoning affects one in six @entity1 every year caused by rotting meat and vegetables , dirty water and unhygienic kitchens			1
but a new technique using just electricity and water could one day make food safer , without damaging the environment			2
researchers claim that tiny nano - sized droplets of electrically charged water filled with free radicals could be sprayed onto food to kill pathogens lurking on the surface			1
researchers claim that tiny nano - sized droplets of electrically charged water filled with free radicals , could be sprayed onto fruit and vegetables , to kill pathogens lurking on the surface ( illustrated ) scientists at @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 believe that with more research , droplets called @entity29 ( @entity30 ) could replace current methods used to disinfect food , such as applying mild solutions of bleaches and chlorine			1
‘ fruit and vegetables can become contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms anywhere in their production chain , starting from the field or orchard , during harvest , transport , processing , distribution , and marketing , or during preparation in food - service establishments and in the home ( from farm to fork route ) , ’ the scientists write in their study , published in the journal of @entity38			2
‘ possible pathogen sources include contaminated irrigation water , animals , birds , insects , soil , manure , and infected workers / food handlers			0
’ depending on how long fruit and vegetables were exposed to the spray of nanoparticles , lab tests showed that between 80 and 98 per cent of bacteria were destroyed			1
an @entity71 image of @entity72 is shown think of food poisoning and you may immediately consider raw meat to be the culprit			2
but raw or minimally processed fruit and vegetables can be a source of pathogenic microorganisms , such as bacteria , viruses , and parasites the study said			2
every year in the @entity1 , approximately 48 million people get sick , 128,000 are hospitalised , and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases			0
between 1990 and 2005 , contaminated fresh produce accounted for 13 per cent of all reported food borne outbreaks and for 21 per cent of reported illnesses			0
in @entity93 , fresh produce of non-animal origin accounted for 10 per cent of the outbreaks , 26 per cent of the cases , 35 per cent of the hospitalisations , and 46 per cent of deaths between years 2007 − 2011 , according to the @entity97 ( @entity97 )			0
to create the charged droplets , which measure just 25 nanometres , the team led by @entity99 , sprayed water though a strong electrical field - a technique known as electrospraying			2
the water molecules split into hydroxyl and superoxide radicals , which are usually unstable , @entity105 reported			0
but in the electrospray , a thin layer of charged water captures the radicals and stabilises them			1
the electrical charge serves to boost each droplet ’s surface tension so that it stops the radicals evaporating			0
‘ ewns possess unique properties ; they are 25 nm in diameter , remain airborne in indoor conditions for hours , contain @entity120 and have very strong surface charge , ’ the study said			0
to test the efficiency of process , three strains of bacteria known to cause illness - @entity72 , @entity124 and @entity125 - were applied to tomatoes and stainless steel surfaces			1
tomatoes were then sprayed with nanoparticles in an enclosed chamber for between 30 and 45 minutes , while the steel samples were exposed for 15 to 45 minutes			0
scientists believe that with more research , droplets called @entity29 ( @entity30 ) could replace current methods used to disinfect food , such as applying mild solutions of bleaches and chlorine			1
they tested their technique on tomatoes ( stock picture shown ) depending on how long fruit and vegetables were exposed to the spray of nanoparticles , lab tests showed that between 80 and 98 per cent of bacteria were destroyed			1
the study added : ‘ the results presented here indicate that this novel , chemical - free , and environmentally friendly intervention method holds potential for development and application in the food industry , as a “ green ” alternative to existing disinfection methods			0
’ the scientists claim that the charged water does not change the taste or texture of food			1
however , it could be years before it can be used to treat produce sold in supermarkets because current rules stipulate that treatments must kill 99.999 per cent of bacteria .			0

*experts* made droplets using electrically charged water and free radicals
sprayed onto fruit and vegetables , they can kill up to 98 *%* of bacteria
@entity72 , @entity124 and @entity125 were tested in the *experiment* on tomatoes
the method could one day replace current ways of disinfecting food
