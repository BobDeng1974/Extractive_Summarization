vintage vehicle enthusiast @entity16 said the couple 's labour of love would not even move when they bought it eight years ago			1
he said : ' i used to live in a similar bus and was trying to do cinema from that but i could never really take it to a public space			2
' @entity96 said buy @entity98 's cinema bus and i went to see it and it was a big old grey rusty heap			2
' the engine was seized , the breaks were seized , so it was a mess			0

' i did most of the work with a really good friend			0
it was the same mechanics as the bus i used to live on			0
' as we went along i tried not to think about the fact i was spending so much money on it			0
' people appreciate it because it 's a piece of cinema history but other people see it as a piece of automative industrial history			0
' his partner - of - seven - years miss @entity15 , added : ' it was a beast really - the inside was gutted and it was just a complete mess			1
' @entity16 was a visual arts student specialising in cinema and he 's also a vintage vehicle enthusiast			1
' so when someone told him about the bus , it married together his two loves			0
' it has taken a lot of @entity143 to reach this point , plus help from volunteers			0

the remaining six were resigned to the scrapheap the seven buses were operated by @entity150 , the @entity151			0
in 1974 the government sold off the buses ' it looks great			0

it 's quite a unique piece of heritage			0

they then hit the road , touring towns and villages in @entity181 showing eight 20 - minute films featuring clips about the region that had laid buried in archives , away from public view , for 50 years or more			1
the pair now take the historic bus across the country for company 's to hire out for events			2
