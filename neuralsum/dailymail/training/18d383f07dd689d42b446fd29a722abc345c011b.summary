we came home and we both had the same answer so we gave it one more shot and it worked , ' he said			0
the couple had never planned on having triplets			0
initially they were told they were having one baby , then two and then an email came into @entity8 's work address stating ' triplets at nine weeks '			1

a @entity15 couple who had travelled to @entity13 to bring home twins born via surrogate left the world reeling after they left their disabled son @entity4 in @entity13 internet whiz @entity8 stumbled across a forum online for prospective surrogate parents			1
with over 500 members on the site it was a reassuring presence for the men , who would speak to people about what contact they had managed to make with @entity13 agencies			2
their nerves grew as reports surfaced on the forum that some surrogate mothers were resorting to aborting their babies as they had not heard from the parents in weeks			2
as the weeks rolled on , minister for foreign affairs @entity145 stepped in			1
posting on the forum , her government told the couples that she would speak to the @entity13 military			2

after spending two months filling out streams of paperwork , @entity8 and @entity9 were finally able to bring their babies home to @entity1			1
life at home would never be the same for @entity8 and @entity9			1
jet - lagged and exhausted , the first - time parents did n't sleep for 24 hours			0
their friends and family had told them that triplets would be challenging but the men did n't realise how demanding it would be			0
' we had no idea			0
people were warning us but we just thought it wo n’t be any different because we ’ll just go straight into a triplet situation without stressing because we wo n’t know any better , ' @entity8 said			0
now at 12 - weeks - old the couple admit that being the parents to triplets is demanding but rewarding			0

' its still hard because they 're changing and when you want to sleep you just ca n’t get it , ' he said			0
the parents admit that cooking a meal is out of the question when the girls are awake and they survive on just four hours sleep a night to get them through			0
' with mum being here i could do a bit of house work and feed the two little puppies , but in general it takes it ’s toll			0
' @entity9 returned to work a week after the triplets came home			0
