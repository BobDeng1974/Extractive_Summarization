unsightly speakers with trailing wires are an unwelcome feature of many living rooms			0
but now there is an alternative that claims to be ' invisible ' and able to disappear into its surroundings as the main bulk of the speaker is completely transparent			2
a @entity11 firm has developed an ultra-thin clear acrylic speaker that will cost $ 350 ( £ 215 ) – which is a cheaper alternative to embedding speakers into walls and does not require @entity16 skills either			1
it uses a 1mm thin sheet of acrylic to create the sound and is wireless			1
traditional speakers generate sound in one direction but the curved surface of the @entity25 model emits sound in multiple directions , according to @entity44 of @entity45 in @entity46			1
there is no grill or cover between the speaker and your ears – so that the sound is clearer than ever , it said			2

' mr @entity66 said that the company wants to give consumers the same experience if walking into a purposely designed room with speakers embedded in walls and ceilings , at a fraction of the cost			1

the base comes in three colours to help it blend n further with the decor of a room traditional cone speakers push sound from behind , but vibrations are driven along the outside of the clear glass ' thin membrane in the @entity25 speaker			2
