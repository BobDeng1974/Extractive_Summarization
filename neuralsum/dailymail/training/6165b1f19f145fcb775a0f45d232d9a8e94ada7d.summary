created : 03:30 est , 27 may 2014 this is the moment a schoolboy carried out a light - hearted prank – and found himself at the centre of a police investigation			2
year 13 pupil @entity5 lies in wait for his head of year , a custard pie in hand			1
it was the last day of term at @entity12 , when pupils are allowed to take playful revenge on their teachers who laugh it off and join in the fun			2
after the incident , @entity5 was expelled from the school and quizzed by police but when @entity5 slapped the custard pie – actually a plate of whipped cream – in the teacher ’s face he did not get the reaction from her he was expecting			1
she reported him and a week later the 18 - year - old was hauled to a police station for questioning on suspicion of common assault			1
after being questioned by @entity46 about his behaviour , he was told to apologise to the teacher , @entity48 , 54			0
in trouble : @entity5 , 18 , has been expelled from school and grilled by cops for throwing a custard pie at his teacher 's face but after a video of the prank was posted on @entity56 , @entity5 was expelled and allowed to return only to sit his a-level exams			1
part of the reason for his expulsion was that he would not reveal who posted the footage online			2
fearing for his university and job prospects , the star pupil has now launched an online petition begging to be allowed back			1
the campaign has been backed by comedian @entity68 and attracted more than 750 signatures			0
writing on the petition , @entity5 said : ‘ during the last day of school – where it is tradition to prank teachers – i pranked my head of year by pieing them in the face with the traditional combination of a paper plate with whipped cream on it ; all as a prank and with no harm intended			1
‘ other teachers had been victims of pranks throughout the day so i thought mine would go down in the same manner			0
the school treated the prank as “ common assault ” and pursued to punish myself by means of contacting the police			1
‘ there were other pranks throughout the day , for example a student threw a water balloon at a teacher and it exploded all over them			0
’ furious teachers failed to see the funny side and reported @entity5 to the police before expelling him after finding a video of the incident online @entity5 , 18 , was celebrating his last day of lessons when he grabbed the paper plate topped with whipped cream and threw it at the schoolmistress @entity110 , in @entity109 where @entity5 ' slapped ' a female teacher 's face with a custard pie during an end - of - term prank speaking to the mail , @entity5 said he regretted the prank but claimed the school ’s response had been ‘ disproportionate ’			1
‘ mrs @entity48 came out and the opportunity arose , my friends were egging me on , so i just did it , ’ he said			0
‘ but we ’re not the best of friends , she ’s just not got a sense of humour when it comes to me			0
i think that ’s why they ’ve taken it that far			0
if it was another pupil she liked she would have reacted completely differently			0
’ @entity68 has retweeted @entity5 ’s petition , calling the pie attack ‘ p * * * funny ’			1
two days after the incident @entity5 , 18 , was expelled by his school after a video of the pie attack was posted on @entity56 but the school maintains the incident on may 16 was a ‘ planned assault ’ on a teacher			1
head @entity143 said : ‘ like many schools we like to mark the end of @entity147 and students have enjoyed clever , tasteful , and original pranks that have neither harmed nor humiliated			0
‘ @entity5 ’s behaviour was not a prank			2
‘ his slapping of a teacher in the face was a planned assault			2
’ he said the school would always take a firm stance against students who assaulted staff .			0
