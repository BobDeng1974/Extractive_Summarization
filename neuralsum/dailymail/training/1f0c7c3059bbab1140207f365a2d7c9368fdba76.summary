by @entity0 a controversial scheme to give new mothers vouchers to breastfeed will not be rolled out nationwide , @entity1 said today			1
a pilot study in @entity5 , his home city , will see mothers receive £ 200 in shopping vouchers if they feed their babies breast milk for up to six months			1
but the deputy prime minister insisted it is not going to become government policy to pay people to breastfeed			1
shelved : @entity15 vouchers are being given to some new mothers to persuade them to breastfeed , bu it will not be rolled out nationally a feasibility study has begun aimed at increasing rates of breastfeeding in an area where it is very low , and it was suggested if successful it could be rolled out nationwide			1
critics rounded on the scheme saying money was not the way to increase take - up of breastfeeding , and the scheme would penalise women who were unable to do so			1
but mr @entity1 said on his weekly radio phone - in on @entity32 said : ‘ it ’s not going to be @entity35 policy to say we ’re going to pay people			0
’ mr @entity1 added : ‘ we ’re not going to start paying people for that			0
but i do want to do everything we can in @entity35 to change the environment such that all women who want to breastfeed feel that they are supported and that they are free to do so			2
women who ca n’t or do n’t want to are of course free to take that choice			2
’ deputy prime minister @entity1 insisted the idea of paying people to breastfeed was not government policy while he said it was not something government should pay for , he added : ‘ but am i going to say the academics and others who are looking into this somehow should stop doing that study ? no ’			1
he was asked by a caller what he thought of the pilot , unveiled by academics at @entity60 earlier this week , and also about evidence for the health benefits of breastfeeding			2
one recent study estimated that breastfeeding saves the @entity66 at least £ 40million a year by preventing respiratory and gastrointestinal problems and reducing breast cancer			2
mr @entity1 told the caller , @entity70 : ‘ i had n’t heard that figure that if you could get more mums breastfeeding that would make a massive saving for the @entity66 , probably be good for their sons and daughters too			0
‘ but i have to stress there are some women who ca n’t breastfeed and they should n’t feel in any way guilty about that			2
‘ it ’s all about making their choices available to them			0
if you can and if you want to you should feel free and empowered and happy to do so			0
’ but he said the topic did need to be addressed , adding : ‘ this is a research study about what to do with those mothers who are the hardest to reach , who are the hardest to persuade , to take that step of breastfeeding in the first place			0
‘ compared to other countries , we have lower rates of breastfeeding and the health effects on children do suggest breastfeeding can be very helpful ’			0
around 130 mothers in @entity101 and @entity102 , including his @entity104 constituency will get shopping vouchers for @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 or supermarkets worth £ 120 if their babies receive breast milk until they are six weeks old , and a further £ 80 if their babies are still breastfed at six months			1
the initiative will not be rigorously policed and will simply require the participating mother and their health visitor or midwife to sign off to say they are breastfeeding			0
@entity118 : research reveals 34 per cent of @entity121 women feed their babies milk formula for the first six months the @entity124 is funding the project but health minister dr @entity127 stressed that he did not believe ‘ financial incentives ’ were the best way to encourage mothers to do it			1
dr @entity131 , senior research fellow at the @entity60 said only 34pc of @entity121 babies are breastfed at six month months , and only 1pc breastfed exclusively at that stage			0
she said : ‘ breast milk is perfectly designed for babies and provides all they need for the first six months of their life			0
‘ the scheme offers vouchers to mothers who breastfeed as a way of acknowledging both the value of breastfeeding to babies , mothers and society , and the effort involved in breastfeeding .			1
