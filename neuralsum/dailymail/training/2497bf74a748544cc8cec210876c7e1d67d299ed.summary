@entity0 was today accused of ignoring a ' mega problem ' with the nation 's finances as the amount of taxes which went unpaid rose to £ 34billion			2
the so - called ' tax gap ' in 2012 - 13 rose to 6.8 per cent of all taxes owed going unpaid , thanks to evasion , avoidance , error and criminality			1
ministers admitted there is ' still more work to do ' to deal with the problem , but the head of the @entity18 spending watchdog warned law - abiding taxpayers are ' losing out massively '			0
the gap had been shrinking , but last year hit the highest level since before the coalition was formed , topping £ 34billion			2
some 6.8 per cent of tax that was due was not collected in 2012/13 , compared to 6.6 per cent in 2011 - 12 , resulting in an increase of £ 1 billion in the gap			1
the increase in the overall tax gap was due to an increase in the vat gap of £ 0.9 billion and an increase of £ 0.3 billion in uncollected tobacco duty			1
ministers insisted that the gap was lower now than under @entity48 but critics seized on the figure to claim the government was failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion			1
@entity54 , chairman of the powerful @entity55 , told @entity56 : ' it is a mega problem that has got worse and this is a very conservative figure			1
the taxpayer who pays their proper taxes is losing out massively			0
' i am worried that what is happening with the @entity25 and the government is they talk the talk but they do n't walk the walk			1
' they say they are committed to tackling the tax gap , they say they are committed to accuracy , better control of their figures and customer service			1
' but then we have to find out that things are much worse than they admit to			0
' the health service has got a gap of £ 30billion			0
it is a big elephant in the room			0
the government is not facing up to that and if they just got on top of the tax gap , they could protect the @entity89			1
' the long - term trend is downward , with the tax gap falling from 8.5 per cent in 2005/06 , @entity25 insisted			1
@entity25 attributed £ 3.1 billion of the gap to tax avoidance , down from £ 3.4 billion			1
some £ 14.2 billion of income tax , national insurance contributions or capital gains tax went uncollected , along with £ 12.4 billion of vat			2
corporation tax made up £ 3.9 billion of the gap , with excise duties accounting for £ 2.9 billion			2
financial secretary to the treasury @entity101 said : ' since 2010 - 11 the percentage tax gap has stayed lower than at any point under the previous government , saving the country £ 4 billion			1
' today 's figures show that there 's still more work to do but our continued drive to tackle avoidance means that avoidance is down			0
@entity54 , chairman of the @entity55 , warned chancellor @entity0 warns failing to tackle the problem of the tax gap ' in 2012 - 13 @entity25 achieved a compliance yield of £ 20.7 billion , rising to a record breaking £ 23.9 billion in 2013/14			1
' the @entity118 has one of the lowest tax gaps in the world but @entity25 will continue to deploy its resources and skills to maintain the downward pressure that has proved so effective in recent years			2
' @entity48 's shadow exchequer secretary @entity125 said : ' these damning figures show that this government is totally failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion			2
a squeeze on wage growth helped blow a £ 25 billion hole in income tax receipts for the last financial year compared with expectations at the time the @entity137 came to power , the government 's budget watchdog said today			2
@entity118 's deficit of £ 108billion for 2013 - 14 was £ 48 billion larger than predicted by the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) in june 2010			2
in an evaluation of its earlier forecasts , the @entity140 said the single largest factor in its over-optimistic prediction was the shortfall in income tax			0
the body said this reflected lower wages and salaries and a lower effective tax rate on that income - with the level of tax - free personal allowances increasing			0
national insurance contributions were also £ 7.4 billion below forecast			0
' according to @entity25 's own assessment , the amount of uncollected tax rose again last year and has now gone up by £ 3 billion on @entity0 's watch			1
' at a time when working people face a cost - of - living crisis , our @entity89 is going backwards and the deficit is still high , it 's even more vital that everyone pays their fair share of tax			0
' @entity48 has set out a clear approach to tackling tax avoidance , including measures to help raise revenues for our @entity174			0
in contrast , @entity0 is failing to tackle the tax gap while giving the top one per cent of earners a £ 3 billion a year tax cut			1
' it came on the day @entity25 said it would close another 14 offices and cut more than 400 jobs			0
the @entity183 claimed that more than 1,000 jobs would be lost – and warned it did not make economic sense to impose cuts on the department that should be collecting revenue			0
@entity189 , of the @entity190 , said ordinary people were ‘ an easier target ’ than those who set out to cheat the system			0
almost £ 24billion of the tax gap was from businesses – suggesting that the government must tackle the complex tax - avoidance schemes used by multinational corporations			1
@entity125 mp , a @entity200 spokesman , said yesterday : ‘ these damning figures show that this government is totally failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion			0
’ but @entity101 , the financial secretary to the treasury , said that since 2010 - 11 the percentage tax gap has been lower than under @entity48			1
he said : ‘ today ’s figures show that there ’s still more work to do but our continued drive to tackle avoidance means that avoidance is down			0
‘ the @entity118 has one of the lowest tax gaps in the world			0

6.8 *%* of all taxes owed were not paid in 2012 - 13 , @entity25 admits
