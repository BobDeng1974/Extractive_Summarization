by @entity0 last updated at 10:52 pm on 30th july 2011 @entity2 chiefs were yesterday ordered by @entity3 to stop sending threatening letters to people who owed them money , warning that cars and televisions would be seized and sold off for a pittance			1
in a scathing rebuke , tax bosses were told by the @entity13 that the ' widely used ' practice of mailing out threats to auction off people 's property was ' completely inappropriate '			2
@entity19 mp @entity18 , deputy chairman of the committee , even suggested that @entity21 had been breaking the law by sending out the ' horrifying ' letters			1
' horrifying threats ' : @entity2 has been sending out letters to people threatening to auction off their property and he accused chancellor @entity29 of turning a blind eye to the abuse after one of his treasury ministers appeared to condone it			1
earlier this year , @entity35 exposed how the tax office was targeting thousands of people among @entity38 's ten million self - assessment taxpayers who had failed to respond to tax demands			2
in a damning report this weekend on @entity21 's performance , the treasury committee said : ' these letters appear to have been widely used without sufficient thought to whom they were sent to , even being sent to people who did not actually owe money			1
' such language is appropriate only where there is strong evidence of persistent and deliberate non-payment			2
' mr @entity18 , who led the inquiry , praised @entity35 for exposing the @entity21 tactics			1
he said : ' this was one of the most disturbing things uncovered in our inquiry			2
they were sending these out to taxpayers , seemingly on a random basis , and telling them to pay up within weeks			0
' there was no question of saying we would like to discuss this with you , or you can phone this number , and you have a right of appeal			0
' it was just : pay up this money – and it was often a four - figure number – within weeks or we will seize your goods			0
' imagine the effect on someone elderly and vulnerable living on their own if they got a letter like that			0
' ' disappointing ' : treasury minister @entity81 was on the receiving end of stern criticism from the committee the @entity86 mp also warned that unless the letters were being sent to people who had repeatedly and deliberately refused to pay up , they were illegal			1
he also voiced his anger that treasury minister @entity81 , who oversees @entity21 , appeared to condone the practice			1
mr @entity18 said : ' the minister came before us and i was disappointed because he took the line that they owed money and they had to get it			0
' he seemed to think it was acceptable but the committee did n't			0
' earlier this year , @entity35 exposed how @entity21 was targeting thousands of people among @entity38 's ten million self - assessment taxpayers who had failed to respond to tax demands			1
in a provocative twin - track tactic , tax chiefs set out to humiliate people into paying up by threatening to seize their possessions and auction them off publicly for a fraction of their real value , and warning them that if they refused the government would run out of money to treat the sick and educate the nation 's children			0
one letter sent from the @entity21 office in @entity117 described in graphic terms how ' embarrassing ' and costly it would be for the taxpayer if a debt of more than £ 2,000 was not settled			1
' we must collect this tax from you to pay for the hospitals and schools we all rely on			0
we will do that by taking your possessions and auctioning them publicly			0
' we do n't like doing this because people have told us it is embarrassing for them and it will cost you so much more to pay this way			0
' for instance , if your car is worth several thousand pounds , it might sell for only a few hundred pounds at auction , a flat - screen tv costing £ 2,000 would typically sell for about £ 200 - £ 300 , and an £ 800 laptop would sell for about £ 100			0
' praised : the @entity35 story from earlier this year that exposed how @entity21 was sending menacing letters to late payers in their report , mps painted a dismal picture of @entity21 as an organisation in deep crisis , with ' endemic delays '			1
staff were so over-stretched that more than half of calls from the public went unanswered and letters were ignored for months			2
the report comes after @entity21 admitted last year that six million people had paid the wrong amount of tax in previous years			2
last night @entity21 remained defiant about the letters , saying most of the them were sent to people who either repeatedly failed to respond or refused to pay up			1
the @entity160 declined to make a statement last night .			0

@entity21 warned letters could be breaking the law
