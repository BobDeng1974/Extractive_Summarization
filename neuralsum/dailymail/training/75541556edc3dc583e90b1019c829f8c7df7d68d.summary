by @entity0 published : 07:19 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 01:55 est , 28 may 2013 @entity1 may have given the world a glimpse of the @entity4 - or played an elaborate practical joke on millions of @entity6			1
the firm 's latest @entity8 advert shows a user listening to an @entity8 , but with a mysterious gadget on his wrist			1
although the screen can not be clearly seen , many online users have speculated that the gadget is in fact @entity1 's much rumoured @entity4			1
the speculation has let to hundreds of @entity1 fans creating their own mockups of an @entity4			1
however , some onlookers have also pointed out that the device looks uncannily like @entity1 's current @entity39 , which has wrist mounts available for it it turning into a basic watch			1
the advert comes just weeks before @entity1 's @entity44 event for developers , where it tradictionally reveals new products			1
this year it is expected to reveal a major overhaul of its @entity49 software , which reports claim will replace the current software with a ' flat ' design being overseen by the sir @entity53 , the firm 's @entity54 - born design boss			1
however , it has also been rumoured the firm could also reveal details of its much rumoured tv service - and even unveil the @entity59			1
recently @entity61 magazine revealed its idea for the watch , shown below			0
' we worked with 3d artist @entity65 to conceive , design and construct a plausible @entity1 watch , ' said @entity68 , editor in chief of @entity61 magazine			1
' the brief we gave ourselves was that it had to feel like something we could actually imagine buying from an @entity71			0
' we came to the conclusion that @entity1 ’s most likely play would be to keep its watch as conventional as possible , with the feel of something classic rather than excitably innovative			1
' this ruled out the ‘ slap wrap ’ design featured in a recent @entity1 patent , which harked back to the 1980s toy craze			1
' we came back to the classic leather strap , something @entity1 could make well – like the @entity83 , for example – but for which third parties could also offer alternatives			2
@entity88 's vision of the @entity4 : it believes the watch would look similar to the @entity8 , and work with @entity1 's handset to display information the @entity4 will have a leather strap rather than the ' slap wrap ' band recently revealed in a patent application , the magazine reveals the magazine also believe the watch will look similar to @entity1 's current iphone 5 design			1
' we based the body of the watch on the @entity8 , because its jewel - like bevelled finish seemed ideally suited to a device in the form of jewellery , ' said @entity68			0
the team believe a first generation @entity4 may not include a webcam , and will rely on an iphone for its data connection			0
it also believes @entity1 may come up with a clever solution for conserving battery life			2
' @entity1 would surely find a nice solution : it has numerous patents on motion and position sensors , and could come up with a way of guessing when you 're going to look at your watch			1
' a simpler solution might be to formalise the wrist - twisting gesture that typically accompanies checking the time			0
' however , @entity68 also admits the magazine has no insider knowledge			0
' anyone who tells you they know what @entity1 is planning does n’t know @entity1 ’s planning			2
' but anyone can guess , and those who know @entity1 best can guess better			2
' figure one of @entity1 's @entity133 no. 20130044215 : it describes a ' wearable accessory device ' which mounts a touchscreen on the user 's wrist using the same technology as a slap wrap earlier this year it was revealed @entity1 had patented several technology that could be used in a watch			1
@entity144 patent application no. 20130044215 , filed by @entity1 in august 2011 , specifies the technology for a ' wearable accessory device ' with a ' flexible display '			2
it describes : ' a wearable video device ... comprising : a flexible substrate having a flat state and a curled state [ and ] a flexible display disposed upon a first surface of the flexible substrate			0
' the wrist band type device described in the patent application would attach to users ' wrists using the same kind of mechanism as a slap wrap toy			0
unexpected : the design , published for the first time today , shows that even without @entity164 at the helm , @entity1 still has the ability to surprise popular among youngsters in the late @entity169 and early - @entity170 , slap wraps are bracelets consisting of layered , flexible stainless steel bi-stable spring bands sealed within a fabric or plastic cover			2
the bracelet can be straightened out , causing tension within the springy metal bands , then slapped against a wearer 's forearm , causing the bands to spring back into a curve that wraps around the wrist			0
as expected by many @entity1 observers , the @entity4 - like device described in the ' 44215 patent app would be ' configured to display information wirelessly transmitted from a portable electronic device ' , most likely an @entity8			2
as well as the touch - sensitive display , the application says it would include ' a communication link , allowing two - way communication between the slap bracelet and the portable electronic device			0
' ' information generated on either device can be displayed on either the host device display or the flexible display , ' the application says			0
some of the most interesting innovations described by the application involve the manner in which the device could be powered			0
' the battery can take many forms , ' it suggests			0
' for example , the battery can be distributed in nature by which it is meant that portions of the battery can be placed in disparate locations in the accessory			0
' it also describes methods in which the battery life could be extended , including a ' solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory device ' , or ' a kinetic power source similar to those found on some wristwatches			0
' ' an accessory device designed to be worn on a leg or arm could greatly benefit from this sort of power generation , and could lengthen the amount of time between charging , ' the application says			0
how the @entity4 might look and work : @entity233 's translucent concept is made from a new type of flexible glass will it look like this ? this concept was created by designer @entity239 @entity242 designer @entity241 's beautiful rendition of the @entity4 could easily pass for the real thing from @entity1			1

@entity1 is rumoured to have a team of over 100 *people* working on a watch
comes ahead of @entity1 's developer *conference* in june where the firm *traditionally* makes new product *announcements*
