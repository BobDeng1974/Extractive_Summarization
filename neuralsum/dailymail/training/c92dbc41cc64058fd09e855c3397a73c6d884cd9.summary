' tech writer @entity9 , of the @entity10 , says she recently received a pitch by @entity12 , of the questions - and - answers app need , that came with a basket of swag			1
inside : a @entity18 vibrator , a tube of @entity20 , raw oysters and @entity22			1
tech reporter @entity9 , of the @entity10 , says @entity23 app founder @entity12 recently gave her a bizarre basket of swag during a pitch for coverage @entity12 says he 's sent similar baskets to both male and female journalists and that his company was simply trying to ' stand out , ' according to @entity9 @entity12 told @entity9 he ' wanted to get [ her ] attention ' after she did n't reply to his emails			1
his plan worked — but not in a good way			0
' i wondered whether the point of the gift had more to do with my gender than his company , ' she wrote on a friday column for the @entity10			2
' it seemed as though @entity12 , the founder , was addressing me as a woman , but not a journalist			2
' what ’s more , the vibrator seemed to say that my sexuality was for some reason on display			0
' @entity9 says she emailed @entity12 for an explanation , but he did n't seem to quite get it			2
' at first he was defensive , ' she wrote			0
' he said he was sorry i felt uncomfortable with his choice of swag , but also appeared genuinely surprised at my discomfort			0
' he did n’t want to offend me , but also did n’t understand why i would be offended in the first place			0
@entity12 did n’t seem to grasp that sex — or a woman ’s sexuality — is n’t a topic appropriate for a professional setting			2
' the tech writer says @entity12 explained all the products had been recommended on his app , @entity23 , and that each of the gifts came with a screenshot showing in what context the product had been mentioned			1
@entity9 says @entity12 ' basket included a @entity18 vibrator ( stock image ) the tech founder also included @entity20 brand lubricant and a bottle of tequila ( neither pictured ) , @entity9 says @entity12 said he 'd sent the same items to both male and female journalists , according to @entity9			1
but , the writer , pointed out , ' people in the @entity23 community have also recommended solar phone chargers and stores for buying high - quality letter paper , as well as doled out advice for first date spots in @entity86			0
' @entity12 said his company picked the items that would ' stand out , ' @entity9 says			1
' in retrospect we did not use good judgment , ' he told her , according to the @entity10 @entity9 says what happened to her is an example of a rampant misogyny that permeates the tech industry @entity9 says that the incident is an example of how ' misogyny is a tech industry institution that has yet to be disrupted			1
' ' i rarely meet a woman in tech who does not have a similar story to share , be it of the venture capitalist who hit on her , the co-worker who makes too many sexual jokes or the boss who does n’t invite the women on the team to big meetings , ' she wrote			0
' sometimes the sexism is overt , but more often it seems unintentional — the byproduct of an industry where subtle sexism is so entrenched in the culture that it is unrecognized as sexism in the first place			0
' @entity121 could not reach @entity12 for comment on sunday .			0
