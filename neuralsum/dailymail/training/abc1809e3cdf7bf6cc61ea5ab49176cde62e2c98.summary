it said evidence from @entity14 , the @entity54 and @entity55 that health problems linked to drugs are ' dramatically ' reduced when users are given medical support and advice rather than being prosecuted			0
@entity61 from the drugs charity release said the figures exposed the futility of the government 's war on drugs			0
he said : ' with recent statistics showing that cocaine and ecstasy use in the @entity2 remains among the highest in @entity71 , it reveals that the government ’s approach of strict criminalisation is failing to have an impact on levels of use			2

' over 90 percent of people who use drugs in this country do so recreationally , many of them are young and the greatest risk they face is criminalisation			0

‘ @entity123 might once have been a drug used only by the wealthy but it ’s been getting cheaper and cheaper since the mid- 90s and is now easily accessible in most towns and cities			0

' indeed , it is likely that other countries are under - reporting their drugs use - artificially elevating @entity5 ( and other @entity2 countries ) relative position			2
' here in @entity5 , we are recognised as having some of the most robust information available in the world and despite what this report says , our national statistics , drawn from a range of sources and independently analysed and assessed by the @entity180 , show that drug use in @entity5 is falling among the general adult population and young people			0
