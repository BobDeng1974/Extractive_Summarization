@entity1 ’s improbable quest to get back into this series was hampered by rain in @entity5 ’s hill - country , but not before @entity6 confirmed his @entity8 spot with six wickets			1
the match will resume on thursday at 2.30pm local time ( 9am in the @entity12 ) , with @entity1 needing 240 on a turning @entity14 track to reduce the deficit to 3 - 2 in this seven - match series			1
since @entity5 have included four spinners in their team – including @entity20 for his first game since remodelling an illegal bowling action – it will not be straightforward			2
@entity6 , celebrating getting @entity23 , took six wickets in @entity14 @entity6 acknowledges the crowd after taking his fifth @entity26 wicket @entity27 celebrates taking the first wicket of the day after having @entity29 caught at slip @entity31 is bowled by @entity32 after a typically expansive innings @entity34 jumps for joy after dismissing @entity36 , his first wicket of a fruitful innings but the @entity1 management will take heart from the performance of @entity6 , whose figures of six for 48 mean he can now boast two of @entity1 ’s three six - wicket hauls in one - day internationals			1
@entity6 claimed six for 45 at @entity46 in january 2011 , but @entity1 ’s best one - day analysis remains an unlikely six for 31 by @entity48 against @entity49 at @entity50 in 2005			1
and with @entity52 and @entity53 both set to return from injury in time for the @entity8 , and @entity27 having put his confidence - sapping @entity56 tour behind him , the form of @entity34 will convince @entity1 they can match other teams for seam - bowling depth in @entity60 and @entity61			1
@entity34 ’s first spell had been a below - par three - over burst costing 17 after @entity27 had removed @entity29 third ball for a duck , caught by @entity32 at second slip			0
@entity66 then brought @entity6 back for a two - over burst that produced the prized scalp of @entity36 , driving carelessly to the reliable @entity69 , this time stationed at a widish first slip			1
but it was n’t until his final spell that @entity6 cashed in			2
in 2.5 overs he claimed five wicket for 19 runs , including @entity23 , caught at deep midwicket by @entity77 after a typically classy 91			1
@entity79 was caught and bowled after top - edging a pull on to his helmet , @entity20 was bowled , @entity78 caught at deep midwicket , and @entity82 bowled middle stump first ball			0
it meant @entity5 failed by six balls to bat out their 50 overs			0
if @entity6 picked up the wickets , he was grateful to @entity91 – back in the side after missing out on the last two games so the selectors could take a look at @entity96			2
@entity91 conceded only 33 in 10 high - class overs and trapped @entity98 lbw for just eight – a useful retort to his puzzling omission from the fourth game on a turning pitch in @entity103			0
@entity23 plays the ball through the covers on the way to his 91 @entity107 , the controversial spinner back in the @entity5 side , is bowled by @entity34 @entity6 ( left ) successfully signals for a review after @entity79 was given not out the ball flicked up off @entity79 ' bat on to his helmet and into @entity34 ' hands for the catch @entity6 6 - 45 vs @entity60 2011 @entity116 6 - 47 vs @entity5 2014 @entity117 6 - 31 vs @entity49 in 2005 @entity32 continued his rise with the prize scalps of @entity31 and @entity120 , but the @entity1 attack again let themselves down by bowling too many wides			1
the 15 they sent down here took their tally for the series to a scandalous 56			0
@entity5 , in one innings fewer , have conceded 22			2
but that will all be forgotten on thursday if @entity1 ’s batsmen – minus @entity131 , who has been left out for the returning @entity66 – can chase down the runs			0
@entity1 : @entity66 ( c ) , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity77 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity69 , @entity6 , @entity91 , @entity27			0
the ground at @entity14 after the rain came and forced the abandonment of the day 's play			0

@entity5 score *239* in their innings before *weather* forces abandonment
match will resume on thursday at 2.30pm local time ( 9am *bst* )
@entity6 takes six for 47 - second time he 's taken six wickets in @entity152
@entity23 top scored with 91 for @entity5
