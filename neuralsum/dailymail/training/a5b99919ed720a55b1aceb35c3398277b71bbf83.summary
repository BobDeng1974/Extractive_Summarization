by @entity0 former foreign secretary @entity1 suggested last night that he may have been sacked by @entity2 following pressure from @entity5 ’s @entity4			2
mr @entity1 , who was foreign secretary during the @entity7 war in 2003 , was demoted three years later to @entity8			0
yesterday , he said hawkish allies of mr @entity5 may have had a hand in his removal after he ruled out @entity12 ever joining an attack against @entity14			1
sacked : @entity1 , who was foreign secretary during the @entity7 war in 2003 , was demoted three years later to @entity8 after , he believes , the intervention of senior figures in the @entity5 administration he said neo-conservatives in the @entity4 such as @entity20 ambassador @entity19 were ‘ never terribly keen on me ’			0
but he conceded that his public insistence in 2004 that war against @entity14 was ‘ inconceivable ’ also led to a rift with mr @entity2			1
asked by @entity24 whether he believed the @entity5 administration played a hand in his sacking , he replied : ‘ people say that			0
the neo-cons , people like @entity19 , were never terribly keen on me , but i ’ve no idea what observations were made through the back door			0
‘ @entity2 and i were getting to a different place on handling @entity14 , and @entity2 certainly felt disconcerted when i said that it was inconceivable that the @entity12 would go to war with @entity14 and described a nuclear attack as nuts			1
close : former prime minister @entity2 , left , with former president @entity5 , whose allies mr @entity1 says plotted his removal from the @entity40 after he ruled out @entity12 involvement in an attack on @entity14 ‘ as events have proved , we have n’t been involved in military action in @entity14 – it ’s inconceivable now – there ’s no way a @entity49 would approve any kind of military action in @entity14			1
' and a nuclear strike remains nuts			0
’ mr @entity1 suggested he could have extended mr @entity2 ’s tenure at @entity54 if he had remained at the @entity55 , but mr @entity2 ’s decision to exile him to the @entity58 in 2005 made it impossible for him to save the prime minister from himself .			2

he says @entity63 hawks plotted his removal after he ruled out @entity12 attack on @entity14
and he concedes that his *stance* also led to a rift with @entity2
but he suggests he could have ' saved @entity2 ' if he stayed on the front bench
