the mother 's father , @entity14 ( right ) said the decision to turn off the babies ' life support was one he would have to live with for the rest of his life ' i said would head over there straight away on foot			1

the crews passed me on the way and saw me dashing along but obviously did n't know i was @entity32 's mother			2
' when they got there , they could n't get her to open the door and the police officer smashed through panel so they could get in			0

all i could see were her lips turning blue and she was n't breathing			0
' previously mr @entity14 said neighbours in the block of flats refuse to answer their buzzers to police following a recent raid			2
' if any residents see flashing blue lights they do n't answer their calls because they fear it 'll be another raid			0
' no one answered their buzzers when the paramedics tried them			0
' there are vulnerable people living in that building and the council has a duty of care for them			0
