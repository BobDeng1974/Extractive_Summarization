@entity0 could face the same transfer ban imposed on @entity2 after @entity3 opened an investigation into their signing of under age players			1
the club will on monday present @entity9 midfielder @entity8 just three days after making a huge financial commitment to sign 16 - year - old @entity11			1
and , according to @entity14 , the suspicion in @entity13 is that the club are preparing for the worst after @entity3 's merciless exclusion of @entity2 from the transfer market for the next 12 months - scuppering any potential @entity0 move for @entity19 goalkeeper @entity18			1
@entity0 's new teenage signing @entity11 was presented at @entity22 training ground last week @entity8 could be the last signing @entity0 make in a while as @entity3 investigate their transfer activity @entity8 arrives at @entity26 before his official unveiling as a new @entity0 player the investigation into @entity0 focuses on two 12 - year - olds brought from @entity31 in 2012			1
@entity32 and @entity33 were on a tour of trials with big clubs but before they could reach @entity37 and @entity38 , @entity0 snapped them up via an intermediary who has a soccer school in the @entity13 capital			2
the first was signed by @entity0 in 2012 and the second of the two players signed aged 14 in 2013			1
he is currently in the youth system of @entity47			0
@entity48 sealed three points and a 2 - 1 win for @entity0 at @entity51 on saturday the victory kept @entity0 one point in front of @entity2 at the top of the @entity56 @entity0 have a month to file all relevant paperwork to @entity3 and demonstrate they have not contravened the governing body ’s @entity58 , which only allows the signing of @entity61 from outside the @entity62 if the player ’s parents have had to move to the country where the club is based , for non-football reasons			1
the rule is in place to prevent clubs relocating families from @entity73 countries in order to sign a young player			0
in a statement released by the club on monday evening , @entity0 added context and clarified the reports and their position on the issue that has seen @entity2 handed a two - window transfer ban as a result			1
the ban could scupper @entity0 's reported transfer bid for @entity19 goalkeeper @entity18 @entity86 signed for @entity2 while the club were appealing the transfer ban handed out by @entity3 @entity2 appealed to the @entity88 when they were hit by the transfer embargo for breaching rules on signing young players but the @entity3 sanction was upheld and they will not be able to sign any players in 2015			1
they were also fined 450,000 @entity94 ( £ 293,000 )			0
the players concerned were registered and turned out between 2009 and 2013			0
while the appeal was pending , @entity2 signed @entity86 from @entity97			2
real remain top of the table , one point better off than @entity2 with a game in hand , after @entity48 's late penalty sealed a 2 - 1 win over @entity51 on saturday			1
in view of the reports that have appeared in some sections of the media concerning the request for information that @entity3 has carried out in recent months with different @entity13 clubs in order to verify that the @entity113 on the @entity114 ( @entity115 , @entity116 2009 ) on the first registration and international transfer of foreign minors have been adhered to , @entity0 would like to outline the following			2
@entity0 defends the protection and the correct and healthy development of minors via its strict adherence , without exceptions , to the @entity113 , and is in complete agreement with such investigations being carried out to this end			1
@entity0 have responded diligently , supplying all the information required by the @entity129 within the established deadlines and in complete documentary detail			2
both @entity0 and the @entity134 , through which the informative investigation is being processed , have been left totally satisfied with the information supplied and have verified the strict adherence to the registration regulations in absolutely every case			1
for the purpose of clarifying to the full the contents of the informative investigation , this club would like to highlight that the information required by @entity3 refers to 51 players , of which : – 1 player appeared twice on the list			2
– 10 players had @entity13 nationality at the time they were registered , for which reason they are exempt , as the regulations in question deal exclusively with foreign players under 18			0
– 6 players were 18 or over at the time of their registration , for which reason they are also excluded for the reasons outlined in the previous section and , in addition , because they had obtained the mandatory @entity3 authorisation ( @entity161 , @entity162 )			0
– 2 players under 18 were registered after the obtaining of the mandatory authorisation from the sub-committee to @entity166 ’ @entity129 – 2 players were registered prior to the @entity116 2009 coming into effect , without prejudice to the consideration that , being sons of an @entity174 first - team player , they fulfilled the exceptions subsequently contained in article 19			0
– 23 players ( 24 , if the player who appears in duplicate in the information request is taken into account ) were registered in second or subsequent registrations as they came from other @entity134 member clubs , for which reason they are also exempt as these were not international transfers or first registrations			0
– 2 players have never belonged to @entity0 as they were rejected by the club because it considered in its reasonable judgement that their registration contravened the provisions of article 19 of the @entity115 , @entity116 2009			1
@entity0 regrets and profoundly rejects that the identity of these minors was revealed today by any section of the media , with no responsibility attributable to the club concerning this			2
– 1 is not recorded as being registered at the club , given that the sub-committee rejected his registration and the case is pending a final resolution in the @entity88			0
it should be underlined that whatever the final resolution , @entity0 has complied conscientiously with the regulations , having requested this registration via the legal channels without the player having been registered for the time being			0
– and , finally , 4 players under the age of 12 were registered via first registration in compliance with both the regulations of the @entity134 and the regulations of @entity3 , in accordance with the exceptions contained in article 19 of the @entity115 , @entity116 2009			0
additionally , and for the purpose of clarification , @entity0 communicates that it has passed on to @entity3 all the collaboration agreements signed with amateur clubs , whose only aim is to avoid the abuse of its position of superiority over these clubs via the search for balanced agreements with absolute respect for the rights of the players , and fair and equitable compensation for the club that has trained the player , working as a mechanism of solidarity in recognition of this work			2
as @entity3 are already aware , these agreements , 40 in total , have in no case been used to contravene any regulations			0
all the above shows the extraordinary diligence that @entity0 has maintained at all times in the transfer and registration of foreign minors , and the unfounded and purely speculative nature of certain reports published on the matter .			0

the investigation focuses on the signings of two youngsters in 2012
@entity0 could receive a ban similar to that of @entity2 's
the club presented @entity9 midfielder @entity8 on monday
@entity56 *giants* *confirmed* a deal for @entity11 just days *ago*
any ban would end hopes of signing @entity18 from @entity19
