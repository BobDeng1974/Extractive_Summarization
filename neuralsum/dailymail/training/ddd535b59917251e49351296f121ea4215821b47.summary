mothers are being told to feed their babies chocolate and crisps in an advice leaflet from an @entity7 hospital , it emerged last night			1
the guidance – given to parents at feeding clinics – recommends giving young children over eight months snacks to help overcome feeding problems			1
but the leaflet from @entity15 has raised concerns children will be encouraged to eat unhealthy foods from an early age			2
@entity21 , who works with the @entity22 ’ and @entity20 , said parents should give their children ‘ healthy foods that are not going to get them into bad habits ’			2
( file picture ) he told @entity37 : ‘ there are lots of foods out there that you would try before the foods being suggested in this leaflet			0
’ wotsits and @entity46 are among the snacks recommended in the leaflet to help a child ‘ bite and dissolve ’ food , while @entity52 are said to be good ‘ if a child sucks food well ’			2
@entity55 , director of nursing at @entity15 , defended the advice			0
she said that the leaflet was the ‘ first of several documents given to a small number of parents with babies and toddlers who have significant feeding problems and are failing to progress onto solid food for a variety of medical or developmental reasons ’			1
wotsits and @entity46 are among the snacks recommended in the leaflet to help a child ‘ bite and dissolve ’ food crunchies were said to be good ‘ if a child sucks food well , ’ in the advice given to parents at feeding clinics she also said the foods are ‘ not intended as meal replacements or as a means to put on weight ’			1
consultant dietitian @entity81 , a spokesman for the @entity82 , said giving youngsters sugary food was usually not a good idea			0
she said : ‘ in a healthy child who is having a balanced diet , it would not be necessary for them to include things like chocolate			0
’ and she said there were certain circumstances when specialist advice given might ‘ surprise or appear to be at odds with the majority of what people eat for a healthy diet ’			0
the dietitian said this could apply to children who might attend a feeding clinic			0
@entity15 ( pictured ) has defended the advice , that they say is only given to a small number of parents needing to overcome ' significant ' feeding problems			1
