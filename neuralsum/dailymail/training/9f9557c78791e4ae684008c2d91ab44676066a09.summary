for more than half a century , d - day and the military invasion known as @entity2 have been synonymous with the @entity4 victory in the @entity5			1
but new never - before - seen documents have revealed the codenames for these campaigns were changed almost three weeks before the invasion of @entity11 - occupied @entity10			1
the top secret documents - discovered among the possessions of a late army officer involved in the planning of d - day - were discovered when the officer 's son presented his father 's belongings to an expert on @entity22			1
the urgent memo was sent to senior officers on may 19 , 1944 , 18 days before the june 6 raid , stating : ' @entity2 should be swapped for @entity26 and @entity16 should be referred to as @entity27			1
' the documents ( pictured ) show senior officers were briefed to use three replacement code names of ' hornpipe ' , ' @entity27 ' and ' @entity32 ' the documents were discovered by @entity34 when he cleaned out his parents ' home in 1999 and found his father @entity37 ( left ) had kept the secret documents			1
pictured on the right is an illustration of @entity41 taken from a book about men who served in the @entity5 the memo also said the codename ' @entity32 ' should be used to signal a 24 - delay to the operation			0
the last - minute change came following concerns the original codenames had been compromised when many of them , including @entity2 , appeared in crosswords in a national newspaper			1
the @entity4 high command had referred to the the planned mass invasion of occupied @entity10 by the codename @entity2 ever since it was conceived in 1943			2
the remarkable development was discovered when @entity34 was clearing out his late father @entity57 's house and stumbled upon the documents			1
@entity60 had helped plan the logistics for d - day , which was masterminded by @entity65 @entity64 , and had somehow ended up keeping the papers , stamped ' top secret '			1
mr @entity37 took them to show experts at the @entity70 's @entity22 at @entity71 - and they were left stunned when he explained what they were			1
mr @entity37 , 67 , from @entity71 , said : ' my father joined the army at the outbreak of war and worked his way up through the ranks , eventually joining the 21st @entity80 in 1944			0
' they were based at the army 's headquarters in @entity84 and was responsible for the planning of the @entity16 invasions			2
' my father was involved in the logistics of the invasion and so would have been close to these messages being passed back and forward			0
labelled ' top secret ' , the files ( pictured ) were kept by @entity57 , who was involved in planning the logistics of d - day , or as it was later called , @entity27 the documents ( pictured ) also stated the term ' @entity32 ' should be used for a 24 - hour delay to the invasion ' it was only when i was clearing out my parents ' house following the death of my mother in 1999 that i found these documents			1
' i showed a few of my friends but no - one thought much of them			2
' when i heard the @entity22 was coming to @entity108 i thought i would take them along and that 's when people started getting excited about them			2
' it 's amazing to think i have had them for all these years and my father had them before me			0
' @entity115 , an expert on @entity22 , said : 'd - day is such a well - documented moment in time that i was amazed that something new could come out of it			1
' i was very intrigued when these documents were brought onto the @entity22			2
they seem to suggest there was a different set of codewords used briefly in the run - up to @entity16			2
' our interpretation of what happened is that because of security fears a new layer of codewords were introduced			0
' there was a risk that the @entity2 codename had been compromised			2
there 's a well - known story of how @entity2 and many other codenames appeared in a newspaper crosswords which aroused suspicion			1
expert @entity115 ( left ) and @entity34 ( right ) discuss the remarkable discovery during the filming of @entity22 ' the documents make it very clear these are replacement codewords for the established ones in use			1
' they say @entity2 would have to be replaced with hornpipe and d - day replaced by @entity27			1
there was also a new codeword for ' delay ' , which was @entity32			0
' the documents were issued on may 19 1944 and we think they went into use very quickly			0
because d - day was a success the replacement codenames were then abandoned and everyone went back to @entity2 and @entity16			1
' the new codenames would only have been used by the very high echelons of officers			0
they were afraid the @entity165 might have picked up the existing codewords and know that something was about to happen			0
' new codewords were quickly conceived and circulated on a need - to - know basis			0
the documents we saw definitely had signals sent that incorporated these words			0
' these documents may exist in the national archives but no - one has ever drawn attention to them			0
' they are completely genuine and come from a very clear source with links to @entity64 's office			0
' none of the many books published about d - day mention these codewords and as far as we know this story has never been told before			0
these documents could change history			0
' the story will feature on the @entity22 on december 28 .			0

officers ordered @entity16 and @entity2 to be *renamed* @entity27 and @entity26
it was feared the original top secret codenames had been compromised
the new names have been discovered in never - before - seen documents
son of army officer @entity57 found them when clearing parents ' home
@entity34 then showed them to an expert on @entity22
