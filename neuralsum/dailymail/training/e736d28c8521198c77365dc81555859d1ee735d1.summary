@entity0 showed just why @entity1 are refusing to consider letting him return to @entity2 just a year after arriving from @entity3 for £ 22million as the @entity5 champions demolished @entity6 in @entity7			1
the @entity9 forward has been strongly linked with a move to @entity11 following a forgettable first season in @entity13 in which he spent much of his time on the treatment table , making a total of two @entity5 starts			0
but @entity18 insists that @entity0 is going nowhere and @entity1 duly demolished @entity11 ’s neighbours by scoring four goals inside the opening 26 minutes at @entity21			1
@entity0 made a key contribution to an emphatic win , scoring twice and only missing out on a hat - trick because another well - taken effort was ruled out for offside			2

‘ he is a very important player for our team			0
maybe there are a lot of rumours about his future but @entity0 will stay with us			0
' as good as @entity0 and @entity1 were last night , @entity6 defended atrociously			1
they looked every inch a fallen giant that finished eighth in @entity105 last season and lost their opening game in this @entity110 competition 3 - 0 to @entity111 last week			2
when they met @entity1 in the @entity112 in @entity113 last summer , they were five down before half - time before recovering to 5 - 3 and this encounter had similar hallmarks			2
@entity1 threatened to run riot even though they left @entity63 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 to work on their fitness back at the club ’s training base in @entity124			2
they went ahead after 12 minutes when @entity67 slipped the ball through to @entity126 in the right - hand channel			2
former @entity128 defender @entity72 was painfully slow to react and @entity70 could not get across in time to prevent the @entity1 forward steering the ball inside @entity38 ’s near post			0
@entity59 doubled the lead two minutes later when @entity70 made a mess of dealing with @entity47 ’s cross from the right , and he hooked the loose ball beyond @entity38 into the top corner			0
@entity57 should have made it three when @entity51 ’s cross found him unmarked in front of goal but the next was not long in coming as @entity53 attempted to meet @entity0 ’s crossfield pass with an ambitious bicycle kick which took a deflection off @entity68 and crept in at the near post			0
battle : @entity145 is challenged by @entity1 's @entity55 ( right ) and @entity59 fanatics : two fans get on the pitch at @entity21 to get a selfie with @entity29 in the closing stages unbelievable : city fans celebrate after going 4 - 0 up within 26 incredible minutes in @entity7 watching on : @entity85 and @entity50 watch the ball face off : @entity79 and @entity67 vie for the ball @entity153 triallist @entity34 , still not sufficiently signed up to @entity1 ’s books to warrant a name on the back of his shirt , then scored his second goal in as many games to make it 4 - 0			1
there seemed little danger when the ball fell to the teenage striker on the edge of the area but he needed almost no backlift to send in a left - foot shot that @entity38 could only help on its way into the net			0
a linesman ’s flag chalked off an even better finish from @entity0 before @entity79 pulled one back for @entity6 , tapping in at the far post from @entity78 ’s corner			1
half - time storms caused the restart to be held up by half an hour as players and fans sheltered from the lightning , which was perhaps appropriate given that @entity6 were preparing to introduce explosive striker @entity29 off the bench against his old club			1
@entity183 delighted at rampant city overseeing : new @entity6 coach @entity185 invested in the action @entity187 : @entity59 celebrates a rare @entity1 outing with a goal comeback : former @entity191 midfielder @entity79 pulls one back for @entity6 at 4 - 0 down fun times : two fans watch on at @entity21 in @entity7 @entity29 had the ball in the net within 10 minutes only to see it ruled out for offside but it was a more lively @entity6 in the second half who threatened to further reduce @entity1 ’s lead			1
however , @entity0 killed off any hopes of a comeback in the 58th minute with his second goal of the game			0
there was still plenty of work to do when the @entity210 met @entity51 ’s low cross , and @entity0 dinked the ball past one defender with an exquisite touch of his right foot and despatched it into the net with his left			0
@entity29 still almost stole the show in the last minute when two fans in @entity6 shirts invaded the pitch and race over to the striker			0
@entity29 could have overreacted but instead posed coolly for a photo with the pair before they are hauled away by stewards			0
storm brewing : fans are advised to head to the concourse as heavy rain and storms gather over the stadium run for cover : the entire stadium emptied at half - time while the heavy shower passed the @entity237 @entity238 , wet , wet : the game was back underway half an hour later than planned in @entity7			1

@entity242 nets a brace as @entity1 thump @entity6 in @entity7
@entity210 opens scoring before @entity59 , @entity67 and @entity34 put @entity1 4 - 0 up inside 20 minutes
@entity79 pulls one back for @entity6 before @entity0 completes scoring
game delayed by *30* minutes before the second - half as *thunderstorm* passes over @entity21 stadium
