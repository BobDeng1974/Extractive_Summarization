@entity0 face a race against time to secure @entity3 's availability for the home match against @entity5 on @entity6			1
it is situation that remains as clear as mud as @entity0 attempt to break through the red tape and ensure he can play			2
here is everything you need to know : what is @entity3 's contractual situation ? @entity3 is in fact on a short - deal at @entity0 that began in the summer and expires at midnight on @entity6			1
@entity3 trains with his team - mates but may not join them in the side on @entity6 @entity3 has been a hit for @entity0 since joining on loan from @entity26 so he is not on loan from @entity28 as things stand ? no. @entity3 agreed a pre-contract agreement in the summer with the @entity32 side and he was then unveiled as their player			1
however , his deal in @entity28 does not commence until january 1			1
how can @entity0 secure his services for the second half of the season ? for @entity3 to remain a @entity0 player , the club must agree a loan deal with their sister outfit in @entity28			1
@entity43 would like that deal to last until the end of the season			0
there was initial opposition from the @entity48 but it is understood that that tension has now subsided and an agreement has been reached with the sides			0
it is most likely that an indefinite loan deal will be agreed that allows @entity3 to stay with @entity0 until the end of the season			1
however , it would also include a break clause that could allow @entity3 to return to @entity28 for the start of the @entity59 season in march or later if @entity0 's quest for trophies was to fall apart			1
how have they managed to reach a compromise ? we imagine it all went a little bit like this : @entity68 , chief executive officer of @entity0 calls up @entity68 , chief executive officer of @entity26 and the two chaps found an agreement			0
@entity68 is the chief executive officer of @entity0 and @entity26 so what is the sticking point ? @entity3 's @entity0 deal expires at midnight on @entity6			1
it is understood that if a @entity78 club wishes to amend an existing contract of a player - as @entity0 wish to do with @entity3 - then they require the permission of the @entity78 board			2
this is the process that is continuing			0
so is he ineligible to play on @entity6 ? if this can not be resolved , he can not play			2
the situation remained ' live and complex ' as of wednesday afternoon , according to our sources , but @entity0 are still hopeful			0
@entity0 boss @entity43 is keen on keeping hold of @entity3 is there an issue with renewing his registration as the transfer window does not open until january 3 ? although the transfer window does not open until january 3 , @entity3 's registration is not in doubt as the timespan for registering players goes from transfer window to transfer window , rather than being defined by the length of a player 's contract			1
so what remains to be done ? however , the @entity78 board must sanction the amendment to the contract for this to happen			0
this , it is hoped , can be done outside of the transfer window			0
there remains a significant amount of paperwork to resolve that must pass through the @entity78			0
it must be squared off by the @entity78 to allow @entity3 to play			2
senior sources at @entity0 maintained on wednesday that they remained hopeful of securing his registration			0
he is very much in @entity43 's thinking for the matchday squad .			0

@entity0 are keen on keeping hold of @entity3
it is *unclear* if @entity3 can play against @entity5 on @entity6
@entity3 will be registered as a @entity28 player on january 1
the *midfielder* is likely to stay at the @entity131 until march
