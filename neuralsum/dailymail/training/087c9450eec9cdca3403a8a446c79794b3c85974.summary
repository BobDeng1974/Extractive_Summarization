by @entity0 the last thing @entity2 need when @entity3 goes is a repeat of @entity7 ’s @entity6 trauma			1
spurs raked in a world - record £ 86million for @entity6 a year ago and then wasted it on seven underwhelming signings , like £ 25m flop @entity11			0
to avoid the same pitfalls , @entity14 boss @entity13 has already done his homework and made plans to rebuild a @entity2 team that can challenge in the @entity19 and @entity20			1
so has 20 - year - old defensive midfield player @entity37 from @entity38			2
even bigger fish are set to follow			2
@entity24 winger @entity21 is due for a medical on thursday before completing his £ 20million move from @entity42			2
@entity44 ’s @entity32 striker @entity43 is in advance talks			2
a left back , possibly @entity47 ’s @entity46 , is needed			0
@entity48 wants to join from @entity34			2
the average age of the new squad will be among the youngest in the @entity19 which perfectly fits the profile demanded by owner @entity52			0
there will be some familiar faces			0
@entity55 will continue as captain albeit @entity13 will not play him every week so he lasts the season			1
@entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 will have parts to play			0
but overall as the washing powder commercials go , this @entity2 will be new and improved – even without @entity30 - bound @entity3			1
at least that is what @entity13 is counting on			2
@entity21 quest : @entity24 forward @entity21 is expected to join @entity2 in a £ 20million deal @entity2 set to seal double signing ‘ new and improved ’ ... how @entity68 could line up 2014 - 15 goalkeeper – @entity71 made an immediate impact at @entity14 last season with a match - winning penalty save on his debut against @entity78			1
now 26 , he should be coming into his prime as a goalkeeper			0
right back – @entity83 just 21 , local boy @entity83 has filled in across the defence to help the team but this could be his breakthrough season in his favoured position with @entity60 showing the first signs of decline			0
centre back – @entity48 the @entity93 @entity32 defender has made it no secret he ’d like to join the @entity13 revolution at @entity14 from @entity34			1
but a fee still has to be agreed with the @entity99 ’s club			0
shoring up : @entity34 's @entity48 was one of the outstanding defenders in the top flight last season centre back – @entity103 uncomfortable first season but excelled in the @entity32 for @entity105 – where he was picked ahead of @entity107 ’s @entity106 – and now ready to show @entity108 what £ 17m was spent on			1
@entity110 – @entity46 @entity13 has been searching for a left back ever since he arrived at the club			2
@entity2 have been linked with plenty but £ 6m @entity114 would be right up their street if @entity47 sell			2
@entity117 midfield – @entity37 the @entity118 has just signed in a £ 10m deal from @entity120 and does n’t lack confidence – agreeing to wear the no 23 shirt made famous by @entity123			2
just 20 , he is improving each year			0
@entity125 : @entity2 have already signed @entity37 from @entity38 for £ 10m this summer @entity117 midfield – @entity55 / @entity126 @entity13 knows @entity55 ca n’t play every week as he did last season , particularly with the club also back in @entity129			1
when he wants to go for it , the excellent @entity130 can provide genuine trickery , with can dropping back in to @entity55 's deeper role			0
@entity117 midfield – @entity35 @entity2 ’s most expensive signing of the summer so far at around £ 25m , @entity35 ’s ability to keep the ball moving and pick a pass means he will be essential to @entity13 ’ plans			1
right wing – @entity139 one of the few @entity33 players to return from the @entity32 in credit			0
hard to believe he ’s still only 19 , the ultimate modern forward with pace , technique and courage on and off the ball			0
@entity139 work : the @entity33 winger was a standout performer for the @entity150 last season @entity152 – @entity153 35 goals in 49 games for @entity2 is an astonishing return for a player who did n’t make it at @entity159 or @entity160			1
@entity161 will be desperate to show he can score goals without @entity3			0
@entity163 - @entity21 the 20 - year - old @entity164 is rated one of the best young talents in @entity129 and @entity13 hopes his signing from @entity24 will give @entity2 a genuine threat down both flanks			1
striking it rich : @entity161 ( left ) finished as the top flight 's second highest goal scorer behind @entity3 last season substitutes @entity174 – @entity13 wants cover for @entity176 in goal and @entity47 ’s @entity178 is his no 1 target			1
@entity60 – not the force he once was but in a youthful squad , @entity60 ’s experience will be vital in @entity129			0
@entity183 - found it hard to adapt to the passing style being imposed by @entity13 , but he decided to stay at @entity14 and was one of their most consistent performers last season			1
@entity189 – @entity13 ’ first signing , for £ 15m from @entity47 , the @entity190 is among the most accurate passers in the @entity19 and a growing influence on the pitch			0
case for the defence : @entity60 ( left ) and @entity59 ( right ) will still have a role to play next season @entity199 – one of few @entity201 signings to survive and thrive under @entity13			1
possesses a fantastic midfield engine and is versatile			0
@entity36 – the @entity203 had a roundabout route to @entity14 via @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity34 but he ’s happy to be back ‘ home ’ after a £ 4m summer move from @entity34			1
@entity43 – one of the new stars to emerge from the @entity32 , @entity210 ’s pace and trickery make him a natural replacement for @entity161 if the @entity33 man ever needs a rest			0
options : @entity210 ( left ) and @entity36 ( right ) would allow @entity13 to mix it up up front @entity2 confirm @entity36 deal			1
