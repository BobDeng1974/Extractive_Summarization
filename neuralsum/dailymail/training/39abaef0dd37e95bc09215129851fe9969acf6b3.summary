volcanoes lurking hidden under the world 's oceans may play a far greater role in climate change than previously thought , according to a new study			1
scientists have found that underwater volcanoes , which were long assumed to ooze lava at relatively steady rates , in fact erupt in pulses			1
a new study has shown that these submarine eruptions follow regular cycles that can range from just a couple of weeks to 100,000 years			1
scroll down to see a video of an underwater volcano erupting eruptions from underwater volcanoes , like this one in 2013 that formed a new island off the coast of @entity22 in @entity23 , appear to wax and wane with changes in the @entity26 's orbit around the sun the researchers claim these eruptions appear to be linked to changes in the @entity26 's orbit that occur over time			1
one of the most intriguing findings by the new study of underwater volcanic eruptions is that they appear to follow a seasonal pattern			2
data collected by dr @entity36 from @entity37 showed that almost all undersea eruptions recorded in the past 25 years occur in the first six months of the year			1
this may be because january is the month when the @entity26 is closest to the sun and july is when it is at it 's farthest , creating slight squeezing and unsqueezing as it moves			1
this may be similar to the effect that dr @entity36 detected on longer timescales as the shape of the @entity26 's orbit changes			1
there may also be some affect caused by changes in sea level as water trapped in the ice around the @entity57 and then melts			0
dr @entity36 said : ' if you look at the present - day eruptions , volcanoes respond even to much smaller forces than the ones that might drive climate			2
' surprisingly the researchers also found that these eruptions also appear to be clustered during the first six months of each year			2
the findings may now mean that models predicting how human activity will change the climate will need to be adjusted			2
volcanic eruptions are known to throw huge amounts of gas into the atmosphere , including carbon dioxide that are thought to increase global warming			2
however , volcanoes also release aerosol gases that are now known to reduce global warming by creating a reflective barrier against the sun. dr @entity36 , a marine geophysicist at the @entity81 at @entity37 , said : ' people have ignored seafloor volcanoes on the idea that their influence is small , but that ’s because they are assumed to be in a steady state , which they ’re not			1
' they respond to both very large forces , and to very small ones , and that tells us that we need to look at them much more closely			0
' underwater volcanoes are known to be widespread on the floor of the world 's oceans at joins in the tectonic plates			1
most are located in the deep ocean , where their activity can be difficult to measure , although some in shallow water can erupt with enough lava to create new islands			0
others erupt with explosive results			0
in 2009 huge plumes of smoke rose from the sea about 34 miles off the coast of @entity113 's capital @entity114 when a volcano there erupted			2
underwater volcanoes , however , are known to behave much differently from those on the land			1
the presence of water quickly cools the emerging lava to create volcanic glass and pillow like structures			0
lava from underwater eruptions behaves in different ways than on land , creating pillow shapes shown above this eruption in 2009 34 miles off the coast of @entity113 threw huge amounts of smoke and gas into the air in the deep ocean , the high pressures there mean the surrounding water do not boil and instead forms supercritical fluids			0
in some cases hydrothermal vents that spew clouds of sulphur and soot under water appear , known as black smokers			0
the new research by dr @entity36 , which is published in the journal @entity152 , found that the undersea volcanoes , which mainly appear along the growing edges of the tectonic plates beneath the ocean , are currently in a relatively weak phase			2
she believes that despite this they may produce maybe eight times more lava than volcanoes on land but similar levels of carbon dioxide - about 88 million metric tons a year			0
however , she warns that as the cycle of undersea eruptions change , this could mean more of this gas being produced			0
dr @entity36 and her colleagues monitored 10 submarine eruptions using seismic instruments placed on the sea floor			1
they also used underwater mapping to produce high - resolution maps providing evidence of past lava flows and analysed seismic data from the ocean ridges in the @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity57 oceans			0
she found that during the coldest periods when ice ages occur , undersea volcanism seems to surge , producing visible bands of hills			0
dr @entity36 used maps of ocean ridges like this one to study lava eruptions from up to 700,000 years ago this , she says , is because sea levels drop as water becomes locked up on the land in glaciers , relieving pressure on the undersea volcanoes and allowing them to erupt more often			1
changes in the gravitational pull on the @entity26 as it orbits the sun is also thought to influence these eruptions			2
the planet gets squeezed and squashed as it travels on its elliptical orbit around the solar system			0
over time the @entity26 's orbit changes shape , altering the pressure placed on the tectonic plates and so the rate of eruptions			1
these changes in the rate of eruption can occur over hundreds of thousands of years			0
dr @entity36 said similar affects can also be seen in shorter time frames due to the gravitational pull of the moon , causing undersea volcanoes to pulse into life roughly every two weeks			0
she found that seismic signals that indicated eruptions coincided with fortnightly low tides in eight out of nine study sites			0
@entity227 , a senior scientist at @entity228 not involved in the research , said the findings could have important implications for understanding how underwater volcanoes influence the climate			1
however , he warned that seismic activity could be due to rumbles and cracking on the sea floor and not actual eruptions of lava			1
@entity239 , a senior ocean scientist at the @entity240 , added : ' the most interesting takeaway from this paper is that it provides further evidence that the solid @entity26 , and the air and water all operate as a single system			0

geophysicists at @entity37 have found underwater volcanoes erupt in regular cycles that range from a fortnight to 100,000 years
they claim that volcanoes on the sea floor are currently experiencing a lull
they warn an increase in eruptions will contribute more to climate change
some climate models have assumed they erupt at a steady rate over time
the new research shows they change with the seasons and @entity26 's orbit
