' we did n't change our football , we tried always to play			0
we tried fresh people to give us a bit more in attack but the game was always difficult for us			2
' @entity45 was impressive in his role restricting the attacking space for @entity6 's midfielders the most controversial point in the match came from a moment apparent clumsiness rather than brilliance as @entity54 's flailing arm caught @entity55 in the face			2
the @entity58 - born forward had already been lucky to escape punishment after he kicked out at @entity60 , but @entity0 had no complaints with referee @entity63 's performance			1
