@entity0 could be forgiven for taking next @entity1 off after yet another festive refereeing row			2
a week after upsetting @entity5 by showing @entity6 a red card that was later overturned , the @entity4 referee was again under fire after this bruising encounter at @entity10			1
@entity11 were furious that @entity0 only booked @entity12 for dragging back @entity13 when he was clear on goal moments before awarding @entity15 a decisive penalty when @entity17 went down under considerably less contact from @entity19			1

goal : @entity17 ( pen ) 38 booked : @entity12 , @entity73 , @entity68 manager : @entity86 7 referee : @entity0 4.5 @entity88 man : @entity17 click here for all the stats , goals and heat maps - including matchwinner @entity17 's ( above ) - from @entity10 the little @entity94 took it himself and beat @entity41 convincingly despite being targeted by a laser pen in the crowd , crowning a classy performance amid the driving rain and thundering challenges			1
it was the second @entity48 in a row that @entity0 has been involved in controversy			0
last year , @entity104 was fined £ 8,000 for criticising him following @entity106 ’s costly defeat at @entity107			0
@entity17 went off with a back injury midway through the second half but , according to @entity15 manager @entity86 , he had already answered any questions about his ability to perform in such testing conditions			1
‘ if people see any weakness in @entity17 ’s play , they say he ’s not quite right for the @entity118 game , ’ said @entity86			1
‘ i think he ’s knocked those thoughts on the head			0
’ @entity11 and @entity15 players observe a minutes applause to mark the 100 years @entity123 in @entity124 @entity11 striker @entity59 battles for the ball against @entity15 duo @entity72 ( left ) and @entity70 @entity44 ( bottom right ) was left with a cut above his right eye after a nasty clash of heads with @entity59 ( bottom left ) @entity15 midfielder @entity72 ( bottom ) slide tackles @entity135 during their @entity137 encounter @entity58 was another @entity11 player to be injured during the game after suffering a bloody nose @entity52 ( left ) and @entity12 battle for the ball during a wet and windy match at @entity10 @entity52 ( centre ) winces in pain after going over on his ankle following a collision with @entity12 @entity11 , though , were furious over @entity0 ’s decisions			1
the 43 - year - old official certainly had his hands full on friday			0
he had to add 10 minutes of injury - time in a first half that left with @entity15 skipper @entity44 with a heavily bandaged head and @entity11 ’s @entity58 with a bloodied nose			1
indeed , at times it felt as though these two teams were taking @entity48 a little too literally			0
@entity44 was injured after an early collision with @entity59 who , to be fair , had his eyes on the ball when they were involved in a clash of heads which inflicted a nasty cut over his opponent ’s right eye that required stitches at half - time			0
@entity135 was the next player to need treatment after a crunching tackle by @entity72 which allowed @entity17 to set @entity76 free on goal , but @entity52 got back to make an excellent block			1
@entity52 was injured shortly afterwards when he stumbled over @entity12 , and by then @entity58 was making regular trips to the touchline for running repairs on his nose injury			0
at one point the two team - mates were stood @entity178 next to the dug - out with the home side temporarily reduced to nine men			0
@entity11 ’s response was robust			1
@entity74 needed treatment on his right ankle following a crunching challenge by @entity55 , and @entity57 was cautioned for a late tackle on @entity17			2
when @entity55 followed him into @entity0 ’s notebook in the second half , he became the first player to reach a century of yellow cards in the @entity137			0
then came the turning point			0
@entity12 escaped with a yellow for grabbing hold of @entity13 as he moved on to @entity55 ’s through ball , and soon after @entity17 outpaced @entity19 down the left flank and just kept the ball in play			1
@entity11 felt @entity15 should have had @entity12 ( right ) sent off after bringing down @entity13 ( centre ) @entity41 had to come off at half - time after injuring his calf to add to a miserable first half for @entity66 's side @entity59 ( left ) and a bandaged @entity44 cross paths once more as they contest a 50 - 50 ball @entity76 's ( right ) cross is blocked by @entity51 during their @entity48 encounter you have to wonder if the @entity11 midfielder ’s lack of match fitness after a month out played a part , as @entity17 wriggled past him and then went down under the slightest of touches			1
up to that point , @entity11 ’s best chance had fallen to @entity55 , who could not direct @entity56 ’s corner into an empty net at the far post after the @entity221 ’s shot had been deflected inches wide			2
but they twice went close to equalising at the end of the first half			0
@entity67 came out to punch a corner from @entity13 and @entity57 ’s follow - up header was nodded off the line by @entity227			0
then @entity57 set up @entity56 , who had time to draw @entity67 out of his goal before sliding a shot wide of the near post			2
@entity52 ’s ankle injury meant he did not appear for the second half and neither did @entity41 , a calf strain bringing @entity49 off the bench to replace him in @entity11 ’s goal			1
the @entity237 keeper had little to do except try to keep warm in the driving rain as @entity11 dominated the second half			2
@entity15 were happy to drop deep and protect their lead , with @entity227 particularly impressive in securing a valuable win			2
‘ in the second half we expected @entity11 to come back , ’ said @entity86			2
‘ but i do n’t think they gained any real momentum to ask any questions of us , and i thought we saw it out quite comfortably			0
’ @entity55 ( left ) and @entity50 ( right ) sandwich @entity17 as the @entity15 forward tries to force his way past the @entity11 duo			1

@entity15 forward @entity17 proved their matchwinner with the only goal of the game at @entity10
@entity17 converted his own penalty on 38 minutes after being fouled by @entity19
result sees @entity15 *leapfrog* @entity11 into 11th place on 22 points , while the @entity11 *remain* on 21
