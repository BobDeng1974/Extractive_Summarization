@entity1 captain @entity0 is not expecting @entity3 fans to change their tune when he runs out at @entity5 for his final @entity8 @entity7 derby			1
only @entity10 has scored more goals against the @entity3 than the 34 - year - old , but , with his time in @entity15 football coming to end , the last few months of the season are being seen as a chance to celebrate his career and contribution to his boyhood club			1
it is not a sentiment entertained across @entity23 , where @entity0 has been the target for abuse from almost the moment he made his debut in 1999			1
@entity0 has revealed he is looking forward to his last derby match as an @entity3 player @entity1 captain @entity0 is expected to face arch rivals @entity3 on saturday afternoon @entity1 's @entity33 captain accepts his summer departure to the @entity35 does not mean @entity3 fans will change their stance			1
' i doubt it very much , ' he said			2
' we 'll have to wait and see on that one			2
' i had some stick from an @entity3 fan yesterday but it is part of my life living in this city			1
' i love the banter with @entity3 fans			1
it 's what it 's all about			2
it 's about rivalries and big games of football			2
' i 'm up for all that			2
i do n't mind it at all			2
bring it on , as far as i 'm concerned			2
' it will be my last derby and it will be someone else 's turn to be in the spotlight			0
' it becomes @entity60 's problem ( as he is likely to succeed @entity0 as captain ) and @entity63 's problem ( as a local lad ) because the @entity3 fans will soon turn on them			1
' @entity0 has a habit of getting under @entity3 's skin , whether it is on the pitch - where he has scored 10 goals in 32 appearances , including the first @entity72 hat - trick in 77 years in 2012 - or off it			1
@entity0 believes @entity60 and @entity63 will be the target of ' banter ' at @entity5 @entity1 playmaker @entity75 has been in fine form during the last few weeks after the 2 - 2 draw at @entity5 in october 2012 , @entity0 was forced to backtrack on comments likening their near neighbours to @entity80 in being a long - ball team			1
he admitted his frustration got the better of him and he went ' too far '			0
' i 've got respect for all the @entity3 players and the @entity3 fans , ' @entity0 , who picked that hat - trick and the @entity85 semi-final win at @entity86 in 2012 as his derby highlights , told @entity91			1
' i think they 're a terrific football club but , once that whistle goes , i want to beat them			0
that 's a good problem for me			0
' it 's the fixture that i look for at the beginning of the season			0
' i love playing against @entity3			1
i 've got friends and family members who are big @entity101 and it 's all about the bragging rights in the city			0
@entity105 believes his side are ' operating at a really good level ' ahead of the @entity7 derby ' i 'll focus on ( saturday 's game ) exactly how i have done in the previous derbies i 've played in			0
' it 's a bit different from a normal league game , but i 'm looking forward to that one and hopefully i can add to my good derby record			0
' @entity1 's key players in their recent resurgence have been the likes of @entity119 , @entity75 , @entity120 , @entity122 , @entity60 and @entity121 and all are aged 24 or under			1
but despite their relative youth - sterling , @entity123 and @entity120 are all just 20 - manager @entity105 is confident they will cope with the atmosphere of an away derby against more experienced opponents			0
' they understand the nature of playing for the club and the nature of derby games , ' the @entity128 said			0
' a lot of these young players have been involved in derby games ( elsewhere ) but this will be a new experience			0
' @entity1 are unbeaten in their last seven league matches , having won the last three , while @entity3 recorded their first win in seven league matches at @entity142 last weekend			1
but if the @entity143 have any psychological advantage , @entity105 is not playing it up			0
' at this moment in time we as a team are operating at a really good level , ' he said			0
' we should have won the game earlier in the season , that is the reality , but we are hoping going to @entity5 we can put in a performance			0
' it was a difficult part of the season ( for @entity3 ) , like us they had a lot of games , but @entity158 ( @entity159 ) is a good manager and he will be looking to build some sort of momentum			1
