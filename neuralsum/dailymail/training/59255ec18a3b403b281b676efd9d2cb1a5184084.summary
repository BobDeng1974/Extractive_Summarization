by @entity1 reporter published : 08:47 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 09:53 est , 25 november 2013 @entity3 police who gunned down 34 striking miners in the tragedy dubbed the @entity7 had put in an advanced order for enough mortuary vans to carry 32 bodies , an inquiry heard			1
the revelation adds weight to suggestions that officers were preparing for the worst when they confronted up to 3,000 workers near the marikana mine in august last year			0
the marikana commission of inquiry , which was set up to investigate the tragedy , has heard how police had asked the health department for four mortuary vans , which were each able to carry eight bodies , to be sent to the site hours before the clashes			1
a separate request for 4,000 rounds of ammunition for @entity50 assault rifles had also been made , it was reported by @entity51			1
that afternoon , police opened fire on the miners , killing 34 and injuring more than 70 in one of the most shocking incidents since the end of white rule in 1994			2
the killings , caught on camera , shocked the world and reminded many in @entity3 of apartheid - era police brutality			2
taking cover : protesting miners can be seen cowering within the gun sights of an police officer surrounded : police form an armed cordon around strikers			2
it is unclear whether these miners are injured or lying down for officers to conduct searches at the centre of violence : the @entity78 mine , near @entity32 , 100km north - west of @entity79 , where around 3,000 miners walked out on august 10 over wages			1
since then there have been several fatal incidents under pressure : president @entity85 in the days after the killings , @entity3 prosecutors then sparked outrage when they charged 270 miners with the murders of their striking colleagues at the @entity31 near @entity32			0
the men were charged under a law dating from the apartheid era that alleges they had a ' common purpose ' in the murder of their co-workers			0
the @entity100 , whose members used to be gunned down by apartheid police at protest rallies and targeted with draconian laws , was severely criticised for using similar tactics now that it is in power			0
earlier this month , @entity3 president @entity85 , who set up the inquiry , gave the commission an extra six months to finalise its probe into the events that led to the massacre on august 16 , 2012 , including the conduct of police			2
the investigating commission - led by appeals court judge @entity118 - began deliberations on october 1 , and the inquiry was originally scheduled to finish within four months			0
however , the process has been marred by accusations of police lying about events , violence against witnesses and stoppages caused by a shortage of legal fees for the miners			0
violence : a mine worker is pictured licking his spear at @entity133 platinum mine in @entity3 , where police opened fire on striking miners armed with machetes and sticks bloody scenes : the shooting was one of the worst in @entity3 since the end of the apartheid era sticks and stones versus bullets : miners can be seen between police vehicles throwing rocks at officers			1
victims on both sides have been killed in recent days gun battle : in the heat of the incident , dust flies and police take cover			0
water cannon and tear gas had been fired at miners before police opened fire the inquiry has heard evidence that highlights not only police incompetence but also suggests commanders may have been under political pressure to embark on an operation that risked many deaths			0
the inquiry was told how police fired at least 600 rounds , while just five 9mm pistols which could only have fired a total of 24 bullets were found the areas occupied by the strikers			1
police have argued that they acted in self - defence against protesters who charged at them with spears and machetes			1
while it is accepted they faced a volatile situation , their defence has been marred by claims that officers have distorted the facts - including comments by the commission 's senior evidence leader who feared the police 's version of events ' were in material respects not the truth ' .			1

police chief said he was going to ' close down the miners ' , commission told
' he asked the health department for four mortuary vans to be sent to scene '
' separate order also made for 4,000 rounds of ammunition for assault rifles '
police claim self - defence over the shootings at the @entity133 platinum mine
