by @entity0 published : 06:32 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 10:34 est , 25 august 2013 an attention seeking zebra showed how to get himself noticed when he bared his full set of teeth to get a treat from a passing visitor			1
the savvy animal was sharing an enclosure with a group of giraffes in a zoo in @entity12 , @entity13 , when he noticed a visitor handing out carrots			1
not one to miss a snack , or a photo opportunity , he quickly strolled over to @entity19 and his family , flashing his rotting teeth to show just how hungry he was			1
baring it all : the hungry zebra approached mr @entity19 when he realised he was handing out carrots mr @entity19 from @entity25 , @entity26 , was visiting @entity27 while on holiday with his family in @entity13			2
he said : ' the place was amazing , like no zoo i 've ever visited before			2
it 's very popular with tourists			0
' the giraffes were in the same enclosure as the zebra , who is the only one at the zoo , and although the enclosure walls were barely tall enough to enclose them , they had no intentions of escaping			1
' with just a few pesos , we purchased some treats to feed the animals and started to feed them to a giraffe			0
' mr @entity19 had to get up close and personal with the animal in order to capture his rotting teeth in all their glory just as he started feeding the giraffes , mr @entity19 noticed the approaching zebra who wanted a piece of the action			1
' he was just hungry			2
' the zebra was one of the friendliest animals in the entire zoo , i could n't stop laughing at him as his mouth and teeth got closer and closer to my camera			1
baring it all : the hungry zebra approached mr @entity19 when he realised he was handing out carrots ' it was almost impossible to not spare him a carrot while i snapped the hungry beast			2
' luckily he did n't try and go for my camera , the carrots were more than enough for him ! ' mr @entity19 , 25 , took out his camera as soon as he saw the animal approaching			0
' to get the best picture , i was forced to get really close to the zebra 's mouth			0
' i was probably only a few feet away from him and i was zoomed to 75mm on my camera so i luckily did n't have to get any closer ! ' mr @entity19 stayed at the enclosure for a few minutes before leaving , much to the disappointment of his new friend			0
' he was a very happy chap , the only movement he made towards us was following us with his mouth open , begging for more carrots			0
' when we walked away , he followed us all the way to the end of his enclosure , to try and get some more treats			0
