one of @entity1 's most famous and smelly tourist attractions has gone under - water that is - but it seems inevitable the boisterous star - attractions will come sliding right back			0
a colony of sea lions who have resided on the wooded decks of @entity9 for more than 20 have made a sudden exit , just as they made an expected arrival in october 1989			2
shortly after the @entity14 earthquake hit @entity1 , the sea lions began taking up residence at the pier and forming an urban colony			1
the pier soon became a tourist attraction and by november 2009 , the colony reached an all - time high of 1,701			0
this week the decks , once full of the blubbery sun bathers , were empty with tourists left to look out over rows of empty wooden decks			0
it is thought the sea lions may have headed south to breed , as this is n't the first time the colony has disappeared on mass. tourists look out over the empty wooden decks of @entity9 where not a single sea lion can be seen scientists believe the sea lions went south to breed in 2009 their numbers rose to more than 1,500 , but a month later only 10 remained			1
at the time experts said the length of their stay , rather than their exit , was surprising			0
sea lions are migratory animals so it is in their nature to move around , @entity1 's @entity61 said at that time .			1

@entity1 pier was once home to more than 1,700 sea lions
the mammals arrived following the 1989 earthquake
in 2009 numbers *swelled* to more than 1,500 then *dropped* to just 10
