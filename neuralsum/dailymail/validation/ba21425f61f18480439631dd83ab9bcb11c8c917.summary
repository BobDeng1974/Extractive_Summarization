the @entity0 @entity1 held in @entity2 this week has given the first indication that the @entity5 presidential election in may might not be a procession to @entity8 ’s fifth term in office			1
the confederation had been expected to give @entity8 a unanimous vote of support			1
but the motion was never put to the 10 delegates , in the knowledge that it would not be fully backed			2
the @entity0 ( @entity0 ) @entity1 was held in @entity16 this week there were signs that @entity8 may not have the unanimous support of @entity20 @entity0 has long been a @entity8 stronghold , but a number of the old guard have been replaced by football federation leaders , including president @entity25 , who wo n’t necessarily back @entity8 at all costs			1
the significance of the @entity0 snub to @entity8 is that it was the first confederation gathering since three genuine challengers — prince @entity31 , @entity33 ’s @entity32 and @entity35 ’s former world footballer of the year @entity34 — declared their candidacy for the @entity5 presidency			1
@entity8 ’s overwhelming shows of support in @entity40 and @entity41 occurred when the @entity5 president was n’t expected to face any realistic opposition			1
but all the challengers were in @entity45 , @entity46 on the campaign trail			2
all the challengers , including @entity34 , were in @entity45 , @entity16 on the campaign trail @entity50 have made little ballyhoo of their considerable coup in having @entity53 on their team for the @entity55			2
natural broadcaster @entity53 has done no media work since leaving @entity57 — where he has been hugely missed — after they changed their racing production company from @entity60 to @entity61			2
@entity63 ’s caution at promoting @entity53 ’s exciting return is understood to be because 5 @entity65 do not yet know how much time he will be available to work			2
@entity50 have made little fuss of capturing @entity53 for their team for the @entity55 the disproportionate financial power of the clubs compared to the national ruling body is such that @entity72 — a key member of @entity75 technical director @entity74 ’s staff at @entity76 as head of talent identification — can be attracted away to become chief football officer at @entity80 by the offer of nearly four times his @entity75 salary			1
the @entity75 ’s £ 1.5m - a - year official beer brand deal with @entity84 for the @entity85 until 2018 at least gives them small respite from the scrutiny around their year - long failure to land a lead sponsor — ironically to replace @entity84 — for the most famous club knockout competition in football			1
the @entity84 contract will also give them exposure on the interview backboards for the quarter - finals at the weekend which were giving the impression that @entity99 , the betting partner , were the main sponsor			0
the @entity75 have a new £ 1.5m - a - year official beer brand deal with @entity84 for the @entity85 until 2018 the @entity102 are now faced with a number of counties believing the @entity106 monopoly of cricket must end , with more of the game shown on terrestrial tv to help address falling participation			1
so , in their wisdom , the @entity102 have appointed @entity113 greatest disciple @entity112 as their new director of communications — as @entity115 predicted			0
during 24 years as a @entity106 spokesman , @entity112 was seemingly programmed only to be super-positive about his employers			0
@entity119 ’s former sponsorship chief @entity118 fell on his sword two years ago			0
it came after he told a reporter the @entity123 , which own the course , were seeking a single , bluechip sponsor from outside the betting industry for three of its top races , including the @entity129			0
yet all four of the marquee races at the @entity55 still have bookmaker names attached to them			0
a @entity123 spokesman said @entity119 had three new sponsors from outside the betting industry and were pleased with the portfolio			0
@entity136 and @entity137 charge away with the @entity138 at @entity139 @entity140 , highly combative head of racing pr for @entity99 , is leaving the bookmakers after @entity119 to join agency @entity143 who conveniently have just renewed their consumer pr contract with @entity99			0
meanwhile , the bookmakers have still to appoint a communications director five months after the search started for a job paying as much as £ 200,000 - a - year to the right candidate .			0

@entity8 may not have full support of @entity0 in election
all the @entity5 presidential election candidates were at the recent *conference*
the @entity75 have lost @entity72 to @entity80 who *quadrupled* his salary
the @entity85 has a new official beer ( it *'s* the same as the old official beer )
