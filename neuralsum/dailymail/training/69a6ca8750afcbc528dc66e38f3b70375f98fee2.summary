published : 07:20 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 08:41 est , 28 february 2013 it may look identical to the spirograph patterns created by children - but in fact this incredible image shows the path of a space telescope			1
it shows @entity9 's @entity8 , which orbits our planet every 95 minutes , building up increasingly deeper views of the universe with every circuit			1
its wide - eyed @entity8 ( @entity8 ) sweeps across the entire sky every three hours , capturing the highest - energy form of light -- gamma rays -- from sources across the universe			2
the blast simultaneously shattered the star and compressed its core into a body as small as a city yet more massive than the sun. the result is an object of incredible density , where a spoonful of matter weighs as much as a mountain on @entity48			0
equally incredible is a pulsar 's rapid spin , with typical rotation periods ranging from once every few seconds up to hundreds of times a second			2
the amazing images were captured over the 51 months the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) on the @entity8 gamma ray observatory was observing the @entity57 pulsar			1
' the pattern reflects numerous motions of the spacecraft , including its orbit around @entity48 , the precession of its orbital plane , the manner in which the @entity8 nods north and south on alternate orbits , and more , ' said @entity9			1
@entity67 , a physicist at the @entity68 and the @entity69 at @entity70 in @entity71 , has transformed data of a famous pulsar into a mesmerizing movie that visually encapsulates the spacecraft 's complex motion			2
the movie renders @entity57 's position in a fisheye perspective , where the middle of the pattern corresponds to the central and most sensitive portion of the @entity8 's field of view			1
' the pattern created in the @entity57 movie reflects numerous motions of the spacecraft , ' says @entity9			1
' the first is @entity8 's 95 - minute orbit around @entity48 , but there 's another , subtler motion related to it			1
' the orbit itself also rotates , a phenomenon called precession			0
' similar to the wobble of an unsteady top , @entity8 's orbital plane makes a slow circuit around @entity48 every 54 days			1
' the amazing images were captured over the 51 months the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) on the @entity8 gamma ray observatory was observing the @entity57 pulsar the movement creates beautiful patterns over time as engineers tweak to position of the spacecraft in order to capture the entire sky every two orbits , scientists deliberately nod the @entity8 in a repeating pattern from one orbit to the next			1
it first looks north on one orbit , south on the next , and then north again			0
an original spirograph set spirograph was a hugely popular children 's toy in the 1970s and 70s			0
it was developed by @entity122 engineer @entity121 and first sold in 1965			0
the geometric drawing toy produces mathematical roulette curves of the variety technically known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids			0
it was able to create a huge range of different patterns when the ' wheels ' used were changed , allowing an almost limitless number of variations			0
a spirograph consists of a set of plastic gears and other shapes such as rings , triangles , or straight bars			0
there are several sizes of gears and shapes , and all edges have teeth to engage any other piece			0
for instance , smaller gears fit inside the larger rings , but also can engage the outside of the rings so they rotate around the inside or along the outside edge of the rings			0
patterns created using the @entity134 every few weeks , the @entity8 deviates from this pattern to concentrate on particularly interesting targets , such as eruptions on the sun , brief but brilliant gamma - ray bursts associated with the birth of stellar - mass black holes , and outbursts from supermassive black holes in distant galaxies			0
the @entity57 movie captures one other @entity8 motion			1
the spacecraft rolls to keep the sun from shining on and warming up the @entity8 's radiators , which regulate its temperature by bleeding excess heat into space			2
the @entity8 's sensitivity to gamma rays is greatest in the center of its wide field of view and decreases toward the edge			2
@entity8 scientists regard the effective limit of the instrument 's field of view to be 78.5 degrees ( red circle ) from its center			2
