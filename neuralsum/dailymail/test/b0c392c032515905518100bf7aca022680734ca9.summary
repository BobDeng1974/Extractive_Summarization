today , the former judge has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident the stand at the @entity29 ground burns after a fire in 1985			1
56 football fans were killed in the tragedy today sir @entity21 was asked about the new allegations in an interview on @entity43 , where he rubbished mr @entity11 's claims			1
the retired judge said the main flaw in the argument that the fire was arson was that the stand involved had no insurance value as it was due for demolition			1
he also added that the fire was examined by experienced and thorough investigators , who found nothing suspicious and that no question of arson was ever raised in civil legal proceedings			2
he explained : ' i 'm sorry to spoil what is obviously a very good story but i 'm afraid it 's nonsense for a number of reasons			0
' sir @entity21 also rejected claims his inquiry was held too quickly , three weeks after the fire			1
he added : ' i can quite understand after having previous fires some suspicion being raised but , as far as i ’m concerned , we conducted our inquiry perfectly properly and i have no reason believe it was other than an accident			1
' the new claims about the fire at @entity29 are contained in the book @entity77 by mr @entity11 , who was 12 at the time and escaped the blaze			1

the book , published today and being serialised in @entity104 , does not make any direct allegations but mr @entity11 says mr @entity15 ’s history with fires , which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around £ 27 million in today ’s terms , warranted further investigation			1
he asks : ' could any man really be as unlucky as @entity15 had been ? ' the disaster also occurred at a time , according to mr @entity11 ’s evidence , when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it would cost £ 2million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by @entity30 ’s promotion from the old @entity120			1
the fire at the ground broke out close to half - time during @entity3 's home game against @entity92 on may , 11 , 1985 an official inquiry found that the fire was started by accidentally when a fan discarded a cigarette on to rubbish below the timber stand mr @entity11 is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry , which took place three weeks after the fire mr @entity11 is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry , describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event			1

he told told the @entity139 : ' when you actually do your homework and see what he did for @entity30 it is a sickening accusation			2
it is just absolutely ridiculous			0

the stress of it is what killed him eventually			0
' he ’s no longer here to defend himself			0
it ’s a real shame it has come to this			0
