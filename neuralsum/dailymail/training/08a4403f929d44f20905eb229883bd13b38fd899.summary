by @entity0 fugitive whistleblower @entity2 is guilty of treason for leaking details of eavesdropping operations by @entity6 and the @entity7 , @entity1 declared yesterday			1
in a speech in the @entity10 , the former defence secretary said the former spy has endangered the lives of @entity14 spies and their families by revealing the techniques used by the intelligence agencies to @entity18 and foreign enemies			1
and he accused the editor of @entity21 of ‘ egotism and self - importance ’ for continuing to print @entity2 ’s revelations after being warned that they damaged national security			1
former secretary of state for defence @entity27 accused @entity2 of ' treason ' for leaking secret @entity7 documents to @entity10 journalist @entity31 dr @entity1 ridiculed the claims of @entity2 sympathisers that his revelations have been in the public interest because they have cast light on the extent of cyber surveillance by the security services			1
he told the @entity40 think tank : ‘ @entity2 thinks of himself as a cyber-age guerrilla warrior but in reality , he is a self - publicising narcissist			0
‘ he did not find or expose anything illegal			0
let us not imbue his cowardice with higher motives			0
let us not confuse his egotism with public service			0
let ’s not call his treachery by lesser terms			0
for once , let ’s say what we mean			0
let us call treason by its name			0
’ dr @entity1 pointed out that @entity2 , who has said he did not want to live in a surveillance society , first took his revelations to ‘ the internet - blocking , cyber-attacking and increasingly militaristic ’ @entity60 state and is ‘ currently snuggled up with @entity64 ’s henchmen ’ in @entity65			1
dr @entity1 accused @entity21 of showing ‘ contempt ’ for the government ’s efforts to limit the damage from the leaks			1
dr @entity1 said the information released by @entity2 ( pictured ) could be used to identify @entity14 intelligence assets and their families @entity14 spies destroyed computers at the paper ’s offices which contained the @entity2 documents on the grounds that terrorist groups and foreign spies could hack into them			1
but the paper simply sent a further copy of the data to the @entity85 so they could continue working on the story outside the @entity14			2
@entity21 journalist @entity31 ’s partner @entity87 was caught travelling with a computer hard drive containing 58,000 ‘ highly classified @entity14 intelligence documents ’			2
dr @entity1 said : ‘ it is clear that the material seized from @entity93 contained personal information would allow security staff to be identified , including those deployed overseas			2
this poses serious dangers to staff including a risk to life , both to intelligence officers and their families			0
’ dr @entity1 accused @entity21 editor @entity104 ( pictured ) of showing ¿ no sense of understanding , never mind remorse , about what damage might have been done to the security of the country ¿ accusing @entity2 ’s collaborators of ‘ pathetically amateur behaviour ’ , he added : ‘ their toxic mixture of ignorance and arrogance is compounded by basic incompetence in the way in which information has been handled			1
’ dr @entity1 said @entity21 editor @entity104 has shown ‘ no sense of understanding , never mind remorse , about what damage might have been done to the security of the country ’			1
‘ this attitude is testament not only to the egotism and self importance of the man but the feeling of impunity that both he and @entity31 seemed , and still seem , to exhibit			2
’ @entity2 released the top - secret cables to @entity10 journalist @entity31 ( right ) who used his partner @entity87 to courier computer drives containing the information through @entity134 the former minister , who is tipped to return in @entity137 ’s next reshuffle , said there is a ‘ legitimate debate ’ about ‘ whether @entity6 have infringed on the personal privacy of citizens ’			2
but he said too little attention has been given to ‘ the material threats posed by the @entity2 disclosures ’			0
‘ we have actually seen chat among specific terrorist groups at home and abroad , discussing how to avoid what the now proceed to be vulnerable communications methods , ’ dr @entity1 said			1
‘ no doubt these terrorist groups are extremely grateful to @entity2 and @entity31 and their accomplices for these useful tools in their war against our citizens , our @entity158 and our way of life			0
’ he added : ‘ it is not our security agencies who undermine freedom or democracy			0
it is the terrorists , the criminals and the enemies of our country who seek to do so			0
what sort of distorted logic suggests that compromising our security agents , potentially putting their lives in danger , is a service to democracy ? ’ dr @entity1 said @entity2 's leaks did not show any evidence of @entity6 ( pictured ) acting illegally			1

dr @entity1 accused @entity21 editor @entity104 of ' egotism and self - importance '
former defence secretary said revelations risked the lives of @entity14 spies
dr @entity1 said terrorists had *changed* their communication methods as a result of the leaks
claimed whistleblower did not uncover ' anything illegal ' concerning @entity6
