by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 when @entity5 had lunch with @entity8 head coach @entity7 at a village pub outside @entity10 - on - @entity11 earlier this month , @entity4 ’s cross-code move was high on their mutual agenda			1
by the time they went their separate ways , the two men had a mutual vision too – of club and country being best served by the recruit from rugby league wearing no 12 on his back			1
in time , @entity8 may utilise @entity4 as a back - row force of nature , but initially at least , he will serve a midfield apprenticeship , which suits @entity25 just fine			1
for now , the 25 - year - old is focused on propelling his @entity28 club , @entity27 , to the @entity31 title as a fitting sign - off before coming home and preparing for a crash course in the 15 - man game , starting in october			1
soon enough though , @entity8 expect him to be wreaking havoc at centre and @entity39 will monitor his progress in the hope that it leads him all the way into next year ’s @entity44 squad			2
highly - rated : big things are expected of @entity4 when he makes the switch from rugby league to union international : @entity4 dives for the line representing @entity25 's rugby league team @entity7 revealed that he and the @entity25 head coach held face - to - face talks about @entity4 and that it was very much a meeting of like minds : ‘ i went for lunch with @entity5 and we discussed it , ’ said the long - time defence coach of the national team			1
‘ we ’ve both got the same view really , in terms of where he is best off starting			0
‘ i think if he ’s got any chance of playing for @entity25 at the @entity44 , it is going to be at inside centre			1
i can understand that if he impresses at 12 for us ; that is probably where @entity25 will look to put him			2
i spoke to @entity5 about that			2
‘ i get a sense that they ( @entity25 ) are looking at him for his leadership qualities as well			2
when the opposition have a purple patch , who are the guys you turn to ? he is certainly one guy who would just say , “ give me the ball and i ’ll get us back on track now ”			0
‘ every coach is looking for a player like that			0
we talked about the way @entity5 wants to play the game and clearly the 12 is a massive player in what you can and ca n’t do			1
he ’s pretty clear , @entity5 , in what he wants			2
his view on @entity4 is , “ let ’s see how he goes at @entity8 ” and if he plays really , really well they will probably look at him for their wider @entity44 squad			1
’ future planning : @entity5 , @entity25 head coach , has big plans for powerful @entity4 new boy : @entity8 coach @entity7 will welcome @entity4 to the fold in october despite the impression that @entity8 ’s positional deployment of @entity4 will suit the national cause , @entity104 was adamant that no pressure was applied – once the @entity109 had abandoned their intention to assist with the transfer fee			1
‘ he is our player , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity115 ( @entity114 , @entity8 ’s owner ) paid for him			2
it was a normal transaction and we decide on how he is developed			0
’ as a former league international himself , @entity104 believes that @entity4 will be in the right place for his education in union			1
he travelled to @entity122 to visit the player and his family back in june , armed with a hefty manual on the ‘ @entity8 way ’ and words of reassurance for a worried mother			1
‘ i spent eight days in @entity27 , ’ he said			2
‘ i saw him for three or four days			0
he has a ritual , every night before a game his brothers come over for spaghetti bolognese – i got invited to that			0
i spoke to his mum about his move ; she is from @entity138 , her little boy is going back to @entity25 and she is upset			2
i said , “ look , i ’ve got three boys , there ’s one in @entity8 , one in @entity143 , one in @entity144			0
you are quite lucky that all your boys are playing for the same team ”			0
’ league connection : new @entity8 team - mate @entity150 knows @entity4 from his time in rugby league double act : @entity154 and @entity4 could link up for @entity8 and @entity25 @entity4 has watched the @entity27 - based @entity155 – the @entity156 champions – in training and spent time with their coach , @entity159			1
he was also in the stands to watch @entity122 draw with the @entity161 earlier this month			0
he is gradually trying to adopt a rugby union mind - set , without detracting from the pressing task of finishing his league career on a glorious high			1
there is a buzz of anticipation at @entity8 about the high - profile arrival from the rival code			1
some of the playing are ‘ stalking him on @entity170 ’			0
@entity150 , who has already made the switch from league at @entity174 to @entity8 and into the @entity25 team , is looking forward to renewing an old acquaintance , even though he and @entity177 may be competing for the same starting place			1
‘ i ’ve known @entity4 since i was 12 , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve played with him all the way through ; for @entity184 against @entity185 , training camps , representative , national			0
i know what he ’s like			0
he ’ll come in here , work hard , be patient , learn the game			0
‘ he ’s a great player and a friend of mine , so i ’m looking forward to him getting here			0
in camps with him , @entity4 was always a stand - out player , he loves the contact , is always flying around making tackles and he has gone on to have a great career			1
i hope he ’s going to have a great career in union			0
‘ it ’s unbelievable , to think all those years ago all we thought of was playing rugby league and here we both will be at @entity8			1
it ’s going to be awesome and nice to have someone with you that you ’ve been playing with since you were a young lad			0
’ there is history between @entity4 and @entity154 too			0
@entity7 ’s son ; the @entity8 and @entity25 fly half , recalled an amusing first meeting between them , saying : ‘ he was at @entity10 , i was about 15 , 16 and i was making the decision whether to go to @entity10 or @entity205			1
he came to the house with @entity208 ( @entity10 coach at the time ) and basically said , “ @entity211 , it ’s going places , we ’ve got a young team … ”			0
six months later he signed for @entity27 – and i went to @entity205 ! ’ now , several years on , belatedly the pair will be joining forces , in what could emerge as a potent 10 - 12 combination for @entity8			1
in time , they could form an effective double - act for @entity25 too .			2

@entity4 will link up with @entity8 in october for his high - profile cross-code switch
currently playing rugby league for @entity28 club @entity27
@entity5 and @entity104 met up to discuss the best position to play him
@entity4 is expected to be a *key* player for @entity25
@entity7 travelled to @entity122 to meet the player 's family
new @entity8 team - mates will *include* fellow league *convert* @entity150
