their crimes were committed decades ago but these @entity3 crooks are as menacing as ever as they gaze out of their police mugshots taken way back at the turn of the 20th century			1
the motley crew , including many women and children , were arrested on charges ranging from petty theft to murder and photographed before being hauled before the @entity13 @entity12 between 1902 and 1916			1
the fascinating images were given to @entity15 back in november 2010 and over the last few weeks historians have been adding to the set which now holds over 1000 mugshots			1
killer : @entity21 @entity20 was jailed for 15 years in 1904 for murdering labourer @entity22			2
the judge said of @entity21 : ' if there was anything that distinguished a @entity21 from the native of any other country , it was the hotness of his blood and the constant use of the knife ' @entity32 : both @entity33 , left and @entity34 , right , were arrested on charges of indecent exposure in june 1902 and february 1905 respectively @entity37 , left , was arrested for larceny in august 1903 while @entity39 , right , was arrested for the same crime in 1904			1
larceny was a form of theft which involved ' taking and carrying away ' property from someone else , but without committing or threatening violence @entity47 , an archivist at @entity48 said : ' as the photos piled up we thought this would be a good opportunity to find out more about the stories behind them			2
' the mugshots include quite a few of children			1
' these can really tug at the heartstrings			2
' among the crooks on display are youngsters @entity62 , 15 , and @entity63 , 14 , who were arrested on 10 november 1902 for larceny , a form of theft			1
historians from the archive have been trying to find out more about the pictures and found a report in the @entity71 which said that the boys were charged with ' stealing on the 8th inst. from a wash - house in @entity76 brushes and a box worth 3s , the property of @entity79 '			2
the @entity71 for 17 november 1902 then revealed that the boys pleaded guilty to the offences and their parents were bound over in the sum of £ 5 for their good behaviour during the following 6 months			1
young offenders : @entity62 , 15 , left , and his accomplice @entity63 , 14 , right , were both convicted in november 1902 for stealing ' brushes and a box worth 3s ' from a wash house , alongside his accomplice @entity63 , 14			1
the @entity71 reported that the boys pleaded guilty to the offences and their parents were bound over in the sum of £ 5 for their good behaviour during the following 6 months @entity93 and @entity94 were both arrested for larceny in january 1904 and february 1905 respectively			0
the offence was abolished in 1968 , and replaced with the broader crime of theft rogues : @entity100 , left , was arrested in july 1905 while @entity101 , right , was arrested in june 1906 the offences are unknown but by the far the most terrifying @entity3 criminal featured is @entity104 , who was jailed for 15 years in 1904 for killing labourer @entity22			0
mr @entity47 added : ' while the images of child prisoners really caught my attention , there was another case featured in the album , which had the same effect for completely different reasons			1
' rather than generating sympathy for the prisoner , this mugshot sent a shiver down my spine			0
' there was something menacing about the prisoner 's appearance and the word ' murder ' on the board he was holding did n't help matters either			0
' the case would have been featured in countless newspapers around the country but i was able to find a particularly good account by searching the @entity133 newspapers collection on the findmypast website			2
' the account appeared in the @entity135 for 26 november 1904 and it revealed that the prisoner @entity20 ( who also went under the alias of @entity139 ) was a 27 - year old @entity21 who had spent the previous four years at sea as a fireman			0
' the @entity135 reported that the man was accused of murdering labourer @entity22 who lived on @entity143 , @entity13 ( with two brothers named @entity145 ) , almost directly opposite the lodgings occupied by the accused			1
@entity148 was arrested for larceny in august 1903 , left , while @entity150 , right , was arrested for the same crime in december 1904 @entity152 , left and @entity153 , right , were both arrested for unknown offences in 1905 and 1908 respectively			0
little more is known about the two women @entity156 , left , was arrested for larceny in august 1902 while @entity158 , right , was arrested for an unknown offence in february 1908 mr @entity47 added : ' the judge 's summing up is interesting in the rather casual way that it stereotypes @entity21			2
' did @entity163 single out @entity20 because he was a foreigner ? ' the report states that @entity166 , in his summing up , said that ' if there was anything that distinguished a @entity21 from the native of any other country , it was the hotness of his blood and the constant use of the knife			0
' the jury found @entity20 guilty of manslaughter and he was sentenced to fifteen years penal servitude			0
mr @entity47 said : ' by bringing together information from different sources , in this case a photograph album and local newspapers , it 's possible to bring some fascinating , if tragic , stories to life			0
' to my mind the mugshot album is particularly interesting because it relates to a port town			0
' it gives us an insight into the lives of both locals and transient visitors such as @entity20			0
' at the turn of the century @entity13 , which is eight miles east of @entity195 , was an important fishing town and shipyard			1
it was also crucial to the industry of the @entity201 , leading to widespread urban poverty which might explain some of the crime documented in these photographs .			0
