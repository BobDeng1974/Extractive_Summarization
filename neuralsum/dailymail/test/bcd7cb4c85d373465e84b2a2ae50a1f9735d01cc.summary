and afterwards @entity35 admitted : ' we were pretty sure the three - stop strategy would work for us			0
' we probably went a bit too aggressive on set - up , which pushed us into a direction of a three - stop			0
' but in the circumstances , with the high temperatures , they were able to go at a faster pace over long runs than us			0
' we need to analyse why that was the case , and it clearly shows it 's not going to be an easy one			0
' it is clear they won the race , which is worrying			0
it would n't be right to say we lost it			0
