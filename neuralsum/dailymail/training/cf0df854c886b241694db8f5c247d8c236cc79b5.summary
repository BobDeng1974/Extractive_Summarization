@entity0 has been likened to @entity1 with his quiff when most families show off their newborns for the first time many draw similarities with their mother 's nose or eyes			1
but when @entity10 was born there was only one comparison - @entity1			1
the ten week old child was born with a full head of black hair which has formed into a natural quiff and sideburns			1
the youngster 's hair style has opposed any attempts to brush his style flat and has retained his quiff			2
his parents @entity22 and @entity23 hope to nurture their son 's musical links and have bought an @entity26 for his nursery			1
mrs @entity28 , 29 , said : ' when he was born he had lots of hair - and i mean lots			2
it was already a little quiff which was about three centimetres high			0
' i took his little brush into hospital and as soon as i saw his hair i thought ' oh my god , he 's got a little quiff			2
we 've got the next @entity1 '			0
' it is growing so quickly and it is already two inches high			0
' i 've compared him to pictures of @entity1 and it is the same mop of hair , with the quiff on the top and flat at the back and sides			1
' what 's even better is it does it all on its own			0
i do n't have to do anything to it			0
' the couple , from @entity55 in @entity56 are both @entity57 and suspected their first born might have long locks when he arrived on august 11			0
but former - hairdresser mrs @entity28 puts her son 's hair down to lots of @entity64 bars and and digestive problems she had during pregnancy			1
she suffered with ulcer colitis - a form of irritable bowel syndrome - when she fell pregnant , and doctors even suggested she terminate her pregnancy			0
mother @entity28 thinks her son 's quiff may be due to the daily @entity64 bars she ate during her pregnancy @entity0 was born with his hair shaped into a natural quiff ( left ) and has kept the @entity1 style hairdo @entity0 is now 10 weeks old and people often comment on how similar the youngster looks to @entity1 the couple hope @entity0 will be inspired by his @entity1 hairstyle and have bought an @entity82 for the nursery but she persisted and kept up her energy with a @entity64 bar a day			1
she added : ' i read that digestive problems like indigestion can result in children having more hair so it might be that			0
@entity0 was born with a full head of hair ( left ) and still bears a striking resemblance to @entity1 @entity0 's parents suspected their @entity57 heritage would leave their son to be born with a full head of hair people regularly stop baby @entity0 's parents to remark on how his hair makes him look like the music icon @entity28 continued with her pregnancy despite doctors advising her she should terminate it mrs @entity109 said she played a lot of music while she was pregnant , but @entity112 rather than @entity1 ' but i also had a @entity64 bar every day and each time @entity0 would give a little kick , so maybe it was that			1
' i did listen to a lot of music when i was pregnant , mostly @entity112 , @entity119 , and @entity120			0
' no @entity1 , but we are certainly going to get him cds now - i 'd love if he was a musical baby			2

@entity10 was born with full head of black hair shaped into a quiff
@entity128 have compared baby @entity0 to @entity1 and bought @entity82 for his nursery
mother thinks digestive issues and @entity64 bars during pregnancy are to blame
@entity22 and @entity23 hope son will follow in @entity1 ' musical *footsteps*
