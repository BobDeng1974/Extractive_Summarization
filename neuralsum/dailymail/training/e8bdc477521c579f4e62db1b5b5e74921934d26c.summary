@entity0 can reveal a further tranche of offensive texts and emails between former @entity5 manager @entity4 and club official @entity6			1
in the most disturbing message , @entity4 calls @entity5 ’s @entity10 owner @entity9 a ‘ chink ’			1
on another extraordinary day of drama in the wake of @entity0 ’s exclusive revelations , @entity4 appeared on tv to deliver a personal apology for his previous abusive texts			1
as the affair reverberated across football , @entity5 called for @entity20 chief executive @entity19 to resign after his organisation dismissed @entity4 ’s behaviour as ‘ friendly text message banter ’			1
the @entity20 insisted @entity4 had sent only two offensive messages , when in fact there were three listed in the two letters sent by @entity5 ’s lawyers to the @entity40 in the past eight days			1
@entity4 admitted to three in his interview on friday night , even though he will be aware that the club is in possession of more			2
@entity0 has discovered details of four more messages recovered during @entity5 ’s £ 750,000 investigation into club transfer business , three of which were sent by @entity4 and include the offensive reference to @entity5 ’s owner			1
@entity4 has already admitted referring to @entity52 midfielder @entity51 and his representatives as ‘ fkn chinkys ’			0
sorry : @entity4 made a public apology on friday following @entity0 's exclusive revelations live : @entity4 apologised on @entity57 and insisted ' they came from a man under pressure rather than a bigot ' on june 5 last year , @entity4 , then manager of @entity5 , contacted the club ’s head of recruitment , @entity6 , about a player they were trying to sign			1
a message was sent from @entity4 ’s phone that read : ‘ not taking no for an answer from the chink until the 20th time or unless somebody big blows us out of the water			2
can you tell him that			0
’ @entity9 controlled club finances at the time and investigators at @entity5 are understood to be confident it is @entity9 to whom @entity4 refers			1
a week later came another illuminating exchange , offering what appears to be a startling observation about @entity4			0
at the time , @entity4 was concerned that a player they were pursuing had been linked with a rival club			0
he relayed his feelings to @entity6 , who replied : ‘ he told me he had an offer to go there but will never accept because the manager is a racist			2
thankfully he has n’t met you			0
’ exclusive : chief sports reporter @entity95 's story in thursday 's @entity96 @entity97 : @entity0 broke the story of @entity4 and @entity6 's text message exchanges @entity0 has also been made aware of a note @entity4 is claimed to have attached to an email in september 2012			1
it is understood the former @entity103 manager was inadvertently forwarded an email from a gay season - ticket holder at @entity106 , who had contacted that club complaining of feeling intimidated by homophobic chants during a match between @entity103 and @entity111			0
@entity4 is said to have forwarded the email to @entity6 , apparently declaring ironically : ‘ a must read ! ! ’ finally , a reference to a female colleague in an exchange of emails does not reflect well on @entity4 either			2
@entity4 had complained that the trouser press in his hotel room was not working			0
one colleague suggests he get a female colleague to fix it			0
‘ she ca n’t , ’ @entity4 replied			0
she ’s shovelling * * * * for my roses			0
’ on friday night , @entity0 tried to put the latest revelations to @entity19 as @entity4 ’s representative , without success			1
claim : it is understood @entity4 , at @entity103 , forwarded a message to @entity6 from a gay season - ticket holder @entity4 went on @entity130 last night and made what he described as an unreserved apology for the ‘ three messages ’ he sent			1
he said he was not ‘ racist , anti-semitic , homophobic or sexist ’			2
a chastened @entity4 also said ‘ banter ’ was not a word he would have used , suggesting he allowed the @entity20 to send the apology without first letting him read it			1
he sought to distance himself from @entity6 , who resigned as @entity139 ’s sporting director in the wake of @entity0 ’s revelations , stressing that he had merely received many of the messages			1
@entity4 also denied any wrongdoing in the transfer market , mistakenly believing he is the subject of an @entity40 investigation into transfers at @entity5			1
at this stage the @entity40 have only received information regarding text messages			2
he said : ‘ out of 10,000 text messages in and out of someone ’s phone i have sent three and they are completely unacceptable , inappropriate			0
for that i sincerely apologise			0
i did it in a period when i was under immense pressure			0
that does n’t excuse anything			0
’ @entity4 also said he would be ‘ asking about equality and diversity training ’ , while insisting he would ‘ come back from this ’			0
@entity0 ’s revelations will provide further questions for @entity4 and @entity6 to answer should an @entity40 investigation end with a charge			1
yesterday the @entity40 did not respond to developments , in particular the ill - advised apology issued on @entity4 ’s behalf on thursday , to avoid prejudicing their investigation			1
but @entity0 understands there is a real appetite at the @entity40 to pursue the case			2
disgraced : @entity4 is being investigated by @entity40 shock : @entity6 , @entity139 's director of football and @entity4 's former colleague , has also been reported the @entity20 , and in particular @entity19 , came under huge pressure yesterday after daring to dismiss @entity4 ’s racism as ‘ banter ’			1
the use of the word sparked widespread anger among anti-racism campaigners and eventually led to an apology for the initial apology , issued yesterday morning , by the @entity20			0
a statement from the @entity20 said : ‘ the @entity20 apologises for some of its wording , in its release yesterday , which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist , sexist or homophobic nature			1
that was certainly not our intention			0
‘ any comments that are discriminatory , even used in private , are totally unacceptable			0
the @entity20 will not be commenting further on the allegations relating to @entity4 whilst the @entity40 conducts its investigation			1
’ that , however , did not satisfy @entity5 , who said : ‘ the @entity20 is the representative voice of managers , and whilst we understand it seeks to act in the best interests of its members , one of its major aims is to “ encourage honourable practice , conduct and courtesy in all professional activity ”			2
reported : @entity5 were required to tell the @entity40 , found by investigators from the @entity211 law firm ‘ regrettably , we feel that the @entity20 has done no such thing in its representation of mr @entity4 and mr @entity6			1
the @entity20 were aware of the allegations from the morning of the search order , and their lawyers acted for mr @entity4 and mr @entity6 throughout the legal process			1
‘ that the @entity20 has sought to criticise the club for the timing of the report to the @entity40 is preposterous , because the offensive communications have been in the possession of the @entity20 for many months			2
when the messages came to light , over three months ago , the @entity219 strongly encouraged and advised mr @entity6 and mr @entity4 to deal with the issue directly with the @entity40			1
it was made clear to them , and their @entity20 appointed lawyers , that the nature of the communications meant the @entity219 was under a duty to report their findings to the @entity40 if they did not take appropriate action them - selves			2
nevertheless , with the backing of the @entity20 , mr @entity6 and mr @entity4 chose to do nothing			1
‘ the @entity20 were therefore complicit in the attempt to conceal these messages ( of which there were many more than the two acknowledged by @entity240 )			0
‘ we also point out that the @entity20 members have a ‘ ‘ @entity242 ’ ’ incorporated into their managerial contracts			0
one of the requirements is “ a manager shall not use racist or other discriminatory language ”			0
we therefore find it entirely reprehensible that the @entity20 should itself put out a statement which seeks to dismiss deeply offensive racist comments as “ friendly banter ”			1
sorry : @entity4 issued a poorly - worded statement through the @entity20 ‘ if that is the view held by the @entity20 , as appears from its statement , we consider that @entity19 ’s position is untenable and we call for his resignation			2
’ to add to the pressure , @entity257 , one of @entity259 ’s few black managers , has threatened to resign from the @entity20			0
he said : ‘ if the @entity20 are going back into the dark ages to support people then i might have to withdraw my support			0
‘ in over 70,000 text messages i ’ve sent i ’ve never used inappropriate language and i ’m sure neither have the vast majority of people			0
‘ i know the @entity20 are trying to protect their member , but in doing so i feel they are almost abusing another member , like myself			0
’ today ’s revelations will pile further pressure on @entity4 and @entity6 and will also add fuel to those calling for @entity19 to step down .			2
