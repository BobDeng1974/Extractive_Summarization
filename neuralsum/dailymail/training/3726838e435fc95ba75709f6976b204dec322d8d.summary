@entity1 hooker @entity0 is set to be caught in a club versus country tangle this weekend after coming on as a replacement for @entity5 in their 22 - 15 @entity7 defeat by @entity8 at @entity9			1
@entity0 came on for the last seven minutes of the match which will infuriate @entity12 national coach @entity11 who did not include him for selection against @entity15 in @entity16 on saturday due to an ankle injury			1
fly - half @entity18 kicked four penalties and replacement @entity22 landed one for @entity5 against tries for @entity8 by number eight @entity25 , flanker @entity26 and wing @entity27 , with fly - half @entity29 booting a penalty and two conversions			1
@entity5 's @entity0 ( centre ) turns his head after making a controversial late appearance @entity0 's appearance from off the bench will leave @entity1 boss @entity11 seething @entity0 practices a throw during the warm up at @entity9 but it was the sight of @entity0 running out onto the field as a replacement for hooker @entity43 that will have @entity11 seething			1
earlier on friday , @entity1 forwards coach @entity44 said he would ‘ jeopardise his position ’ with them if he came off the bench			0
on the pitch , @entity18 , at stand - off instead of @entity50 who was called up by @entity1 during the week and was one of seven @entity5 men on international duty , who made the biggest impact in the opening half			1
@entity18 , returned from the national squad this week , gave @entity59 coach @entity58 something to think about ahead of the clash against @entity62 at @entity63 in eight days			0
he was in fine form around the pitch and booted four out of six first - half penalties , one from just inside his own half to put the @entity69 into a 12 - 0 lead			0
harlequins celebrate their last minute try during their 22 - 15 win at @entity5 harlequins try scorer @entity26 makes a break during the @entity7 match at @entity9 and it could have been more as @entity8 , with six regulars on international duty , struggled to get out of the starting blocks for half an hour			1
a desperate tackle from @entity8 centre @entity82 just denied full - back @entity84 a try after he was put in by winger @entity87			0
suddenly , @entity8 woke up and wing @entity27 almost got a touchdown as his kick ahead on the right bounced near the line			2
home wing @entity93 made a hash of collecting the loose ball and nearly handed it back to @entity27 but somehow saved his own bacon			0
it was only temporary relief , though			0
@entity5 seemed to lose their thread and , from an attacking line - out five metres from the @entity69 end , @entity8 rolled an maul for lock @entity104 to drive skipper @entity105 over the line			1
@entity29 converted and then landed a 35 penalty five minutes from the break to put his team right back in the match			0
@entity5 captain @entity18 kicked four penalties during his side 's home defeat @entity5 @entity113 leads the players off the pitch after defeat by @entity8 and the @entity117 grabbed the bull by the horns after the interval			2
tight - head prop @entity121 was a thorn in the @entity5 defence ’s side and wing @entity126 came within 10 metres of a try on the left but was bundled into touch			2
for all their endeavour , @entity8 failed to score as the @entity69 slowly re-gained their composure , forced mistakes but , now , @entity18 had lost his accuracy and failed with two long - range penalties			0
but @entity8 burst back into life and the rolling maul tactic which brought @entity105 his try did the trick again as they swirled the home eight around left and right for flanker @entity26 to touchdown in front of the posts , making @entity29 ’ second conversion simple			2
@entity145 landed a fifth @entity5 penalty to claw it back to 17 - 15 but the victory was sealed when @entity29 kicked through a gap to send @entity27 over for the score to give @entity8 a great win on the road and @entity5 only a losing bonus point .			1

@entity0 was a controversial *inclusion* in the @entity5 squad
seven - minute cameo will leave @entity1 boss @entity11 seething
@entity1 hooker was left out of @entity15 clash on saturday with ankle injury
