by @entity0 the ' @entity2 ' @entity1 was an idol to a worldwide network of men obsessed with the rape , murder and the ' eating to death ' of women			1
but his obsession with consuming human flesh and death started as a six - year - old and may have been strengthened by the death of his son , @entity12 , as a one - year - old baby			1
the 57 - year - old , who was today found guilty of grooming a girl for sex online , told his trial that his fetish was also driven by anger towards his domineering mother , who made drunken passes at him while he was a teenager			1
the father - of - four , who was married for more than 30 years , had a secret double life as ' meatmarketman ' , a stalwart user of the sinister @entity26 where he got pleasure from fantasising about the most sickening crimes			1
investigation : @entity1 , pictured with a snake draped around his shoulders , was arrested after his connection to @entity35 's ' @entity34 ' case emerged , which revealed how he was at the centre of a worldwide network of men obsessed with the rape , murder and eating of women his closest confident was the ' @entity34 ' @entity43 , who was convicted of plotting to kidnap , murder and eat women , although this verdict was later overturned			1
the pair bonded as they discussed a joint plan to kidnap a schoolgirl ' slut ' in @entity51			0
@entity1 had regularly boasted he had eaten the ' sweet ' flesh of a white child and a black woman , but when arrested said these claims were ' jokes ' and ' all a fantasy '			1
he maintained his perversion ' never went beyond the chat room ' but later it emerged he had set up a meeting with a @entity63 14 - year - old he planned to slice up and eat			1
@entity1 began having fantasies about cannibalism at the age of six and would daydream at nursery about girls being taken to the kitchen to be cooked and eaten			1
' by the time i got to 14 , i turned into the villain of the piece and i wondered what it would be like to eat a girl , ' he had said			2
he blamed his ' very domineering ' and ' weird ' mother for his behaviour , particularly because she made drunken sexual advances towards him when he was a teenager			0
@entity1 's @entity82 father was absent , so he says he was suppressed by his mother			1
his cannibalism fetish ' was less to do with sexual gratification and more to do with anger ' , he said			0
' i think it was more to do with disliking my mother more than hating women			0
' he trained as a nurse at the @entity92 in 1979 , later working on the cardiac ward in @entity94			0
he married his wife @entity95 in @entity96 and they were together until two years ago			0
they had four children , including a boy called @entity12 who had died before the age of one			0
@entity1 told his trial that his sexual fantasies were limited to cartoons of cannibalism , but these led him to the @entity26 where he spoke to people ' willing to accept anything '			1
@entity43 , who could have faced life in prison , was acquitted of kidnapping conspiracy charges , the most serious count he faced evidence : emails and message exchanged between @entity1 , 57 , a @entity117 police officer @entity43 , 28 , where they discussed their fantasies to abduct women and cook them in the oven or on a spit desires : both men talk about who they would eat and meatmarketman said the meat of black women is ' very very good ' he claimed he would say things to try to shock the people he was chatting and enjoyed how people came to him for advice where he claimed he would fabricate gruesome stories about eating women and children			1
he told the jury : ' initially , i was looking to find people with like minds and to see where they came from , but it soon spiralled down into trying to shock people '			0
it was there he got to know @entity43 , who he spoke to regularly when he was not working for the @entity145 on the @entity147 coast			2
an email in @entity1 's name said he would be happy to fly to @entity150 to help him kill and butcher a woman , offering to bring anaesthetic gas and a meat cleaver			1
@entity43 responded that he had ' measured the oven ' and would cook her after they hit her over the head with a baseball bat and kept her ' naked ... trussed and gagged ' in the boot on the drive from @entity161 to the police officer 's home in @entity35			1
the nurse 's plan was uncovered by the @entity166 - who found him posting about murder , rape and cannibalism on a site called @entity26			1
the organisation then alerted @entity174 police who arrested the man last year the @entity178 resident had egged on his @entity51 associate , also using the @entity180 , and even recommended eating a victim alive , saying ' i think of it as eating her to death			1
' by kidnapping and eating a variety of women they could evade capture , unlike the @entity190 , he added , saying , ' girls go missing all the time '			0
but it never happened because @entity1 , who also called himself @entity194 , said : ' i 've been let down before , that 's why i tend to work alone			2
' however , they still chatted before and after work about their fantasies of cutting living victims ' feet off and barbecuing them before their eyes			0
feet meat was a delicacy , @entity1 claimed			2
when @entity43 suggested a particular woman as a victim			2
@entity180 said he would like her liver ' lightly cooked to keep it sweet and tender '			0
@entity43 replied : ' i 'm dying to taste some girl meat			2
' @entity180 responded : ' the meat is n't quite like pork , but very " meaty " ... i 've eaten a black woman and a white person '			2
the @entity215 cannibalism enthusiast also bragged about his own eating habits , spelling out a recipe for ' human haggis ' using lungs and stomach and how he used the fat from female breasts to make @entity226 puddings and roast potatoes			0
their transatlantic relationship ended last year when @entity43 was arrested			1
his trial heard that among his intended victims were his wife and other acquaintances , one a @entity35 primary school teacher			0

in march 2013 he was convicted of plotting to kidnap , murder and eat women and also was found guilty of accessing a national crime database			1
he was told he faced life in prison and had served 21 months when a federal judge overturned his conviction for a plot to kidnap , kill and eat young women because he believed it was ' role - play '			1
judge @entity255 ruled that insufficient evidence to support the conviction and his ' internet communications about kidnapping are fantasy '			2
it led to @entity43 apologising for his views , but reiterated the argument of his legal team that ' ugly thoughts ' are not a crime			2
@entity35 police officer @entity43 was charged with plotting to kidnap , rape , torture and cook women alive before eating them - but a judge overturned his conviction because he believed it was all a fantasy @entity272 : the websites visited by @entity43 contained images of women with apples in their mouths during the trial @entity166 agents had alerted @entity174 police to the internet exchanges between @entity43 and his friend @entity1			1

none of this is real			0
