it has been a long standing puzzle to astronomers : why is the @entity3 's orbit tipped 7 degrees relative to the sun 's equator ? now a new theory suggests that violent stage of our solar system 's history , an errant young star strayed close and pulled our developing planets out of whack with the sun 's equator			1
@entity16 of the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , suggests that our star had a near stellar neighbour at the time @entity3 formed			1
our solar system : all the planets in our system orbit at angles to the sun 's equator			1
a new theory suggests they may have been pulled out of whack by a nearby stellar neighbour that has long ago left the scene it is the gravitational of this nearby star on our developing system that explains why the planets do n't orbit neatly around the sun 's equator			1
dr @entity16 outlines his theory in a letter published in the journal @entity42 titled a primordial origin for misalignments between stellar spin axes and planetary orbits			0
the work explains the phenomenon of planets outside the solar system discovered following tilted or even backward orbits			1
it was thought that such planets were victims of violent events in which the gravitational force of another planet kicked them on to their odd paths			0
a ‘ homeless planet ’ which floats through space without orbiting a star had been discovered for the first time			0
scientists have speculated on the existence of such a planet and have been trawling the night skies for more than a decade , although the hunt was described as looking for a ‘ needle in a thousand haystacks ’			0
the isolated planet , shown below in an artist 's impression , which astronomers believe may have been flung away during its formation , is not tied by gravity to a star and in 100 light years away			1
but dr @entity16 contends that young suns may develop in clusters , with the disks of matter surrounding them and nearly always spreading from the equator being tugged by a neighbouring star			2
in his letter to @entity42 , he calculates how a young star 's protoplanetary disk can be yanked off its equatorial orbit by a second star			0
' i think somewhere in the @entity90 , there 's a star that 's responsible for tilting us , ' he writes , adding that it probably then fled the after the planets formed			2
@entity97 , an astronomer at the @entity98 in @entity18 , told @entity99 that he thinks dr @entity16 's theory is ' an entirely plausible idea '			0
' the best thing about it is we can test it , ' he added , telling the online magazine that he hopes to use instruments to observe multiplanet systems and to evaluate the theory			0
@entity112 's @entity111 spacecraft has so far measured the tilt of just one multiplanet system , @entity111 30 , whose three planets all line up with their sun 's equator			1
of course , there are many solar systems that still have more than one star , for example our nearest neighbour @entity124 , which has three stars - one of which has a planet similar in size to our own			2
' there 's a good chance that astronomers will find misalignment in the @entity124 , ' dr @entity16 says .			0

theory suggests that gravity from errant star travelling near to our solar system pulled the planets out of whack
