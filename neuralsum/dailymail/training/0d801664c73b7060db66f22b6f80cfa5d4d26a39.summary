but this young family were able to escape the @entity8 mall massacre by having the remarkable presence of mind to play dead in their fight to survive			1
dramatic new video has emerged that shows the mother lying completely still with her arm around her youngest child as terrorists storm the complex			1
it was this calmness in the most terrifying of situations that enabled them to evade detection and gave a police officer the chance to help them to safety			1
having been alerted to their location , the plain - clothed officer can be seen crawling on the floor towards them			2
he carefully edges his way around a barrier which the family are cowering behind in what appears to be a cafe			0
petrified : the mother looks over her shoulder in fear that the gunmen may be closing in on their location lucky to be alive : at least 61 shoppers have been killed in the five - day siege but it is clear the mother is initially too petrified to move and the rescuer spends quite some time trying to persuade her to come with him			2
shouts can be heard from behind them , possibly from the gunmen , and it appears this is what convinces her to move			0
eventually , the police officer picks up the elder girl and then scoops up the toddler as they brace themselves to make a run for it			1
when they believe the coast is clear , they crouch down and dash out the exit to safety			0
a photograph later shows the elder girl being carried away by a @entity8 soldier still clutching the bag of shopping			1
duck and run : the elder child sprints ahead as the officer carries the younger child out of the store heading for safety : the family crouch down as they run for the exit freedom : the elder child is later pictured being carried away from the scene by a soldier still clutching the bag of shopping that was seen with them as they played dead in the mall at least 61 civilians have been killed since @entity112 gunmen stormed the @entity114 shopping centre on saturday			1
the number of victims , gunmen and hostages has been unclear throughout the crisis as has the progress of the operation to secure the mall			0
@entity8 's president last night announced that his country had ' ashamed and defeated ' its attackers , but even as he spoke shots were heard inside the mall			0
gunshots also rang out this morning , but government spokesman @entity128 said they came from @entity8 forces going room to room , firing protectively before entering unknown territory			0
@entity133 terror group @entity112 today claimed that 137 hostages they had seized in @entity136 's @entity114 shopping mall had died .			2
