by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 1 june 2012 updated : 10:01 est , 1 june 2012 vanishing act : @entity2 was set to take the starring role of legendary @entity5 entertainer @entity4 the star of a new @entity8 musical left his fellows fuming when he popped to the loo just an hour before the play 's debut - and never came back			1
the bizarre bolting incident occurred at the @entity14 in @entity15 , north @entity8 , where leading man @entity2 was due on stage for the opening night of @entity18			2
the actor was set to take the starring role of legendary @entity5 entertainer @entity4 , and no - one thought anything of it when he took a toilet break before curtain - up			1
after 15 minutes , though , the worried cast went to check on mr @entity2 - only to find he had fled into the night			1
shocked theatre bosses were forced to refund 30 tickets bought in advance of the opening night , and turn another 30 people away from the door			1
mr @entity2 , who has just done worldwide tours of @entity33 and @entity34 , never returned to the theatre after apparently walking out for personal reasons			1
@entity37 , artistic director of @entity38 , said : ' we did the dress rehearsal and everybody was happy			0
' at about six o'clock some of the actors went downstairs to eat and then the leading man got up from the table and we have never heard from him since			0
' at that time we were hoping that maybe he was just sick , but he had done a runner			0
' he added : ' it was like being left at the altar			2
' mr @entity37 said it was the first time in his career that he 'd seen an actor flee his own play			2
the incident is hardly a first in theatre - land , though : in one infamous episode 17 years ago , comedian @entity56 quit a @entity59 production without notice and disappeared to @entity61			2
' at first we felt sorry for @entity2 because he obviously had a problem , but then we felt really angry because he had let down so many people , ' said mr @entity37			1
the @entity65 : bosses at the @entity8 venue say the show must go on last - minute replacement : @entity70 ( shown here ) has taken the play 's leading role at the last minute after @entity2 ran out on proceedings to make matters worse , theatre bosses had already spent £ 350 on a fake nose for @entity2 , who needed the prop because his character @entity4 had a huge hooter			1
' the lead role in the musical is @entity4 , a famous @entity5 entertainer in the 1940s , who was known as " the big schnozzola " because of his big nose , ' said mr @entity37			0
' @entity2 did n't have a very big nose so we got a prosthetic nose especially made for him at quite considerable cost			1
' because it was moulded especially to his face it sadly ca n't be used again			0
' the theatre has since been told by @entity2 's partner that he has returned to his mother 's home in @entity98			1
luckily for theatre - goers , a new leading man , @entity70 , who appeared last year in the @entity65 's production of @entity101 , has replaced mr @entity2 at zero notice			1
' @entity70 has stepped into the breach and the show will go on , ' said mr @entity37			0
@entity56 is perhaps the most famous example of an actor who went missing during a play 's run			0
his walk - out took place in 1995 on the set of @entity59 play @entity113 , and he later revealed it was prompted by his manic depression			0
in 2008 , @entity116 star @entity115 made a swift exit from @entity118 's @entity117 , claiming he was suffering from mercury poisoning			2
the actor 's spokesperson said doctors had advised him to step down two months early , but director mr @entity118 was sceptical , saying : ' he told me that he discovered that he had a very high level of mercury			0
so my understanding is that he is leaving showbusiness to pursue a career as a thermometer			0
' @entity130 , star of 70s sitcom to the @entity132 , at least produced an interesting excuse when he walked off the stage during a 2007 performance of @entity136			2
though it was later reported that he had been suffering from a viral infection , the thespian told the audience he ' was going to put the cat out ' .			0

@entity2 left for ' toilet break ' - but 15 minutes later he 'd fled theatre
shocked bosses forced to refund tickets as *punters* *queued* for debut performance
angry staff say theatre spent £ 350 on absent star 's prosthetic nose , which no - one else can wear
