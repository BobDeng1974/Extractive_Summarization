firemen were called to a house fire that broke out after a mechanical cleaning gadget somehow switched itself on and destroyed itself by moving onto a kitchen hotplate			2
local media in @entity7 have referred to the incident as ' robot suicide ' and even suggested it was fed up with the constant cleaning it had to do			1
fireman @entity12 was one of those called to tackle the blaze at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity7			1
did he blow a fuse ? the remains of the cleaning robot that destroyed itself on a cooking hob he said : ' the home - owner had put the small robot on the work surface to clean up some spilled cereal			2
once the robot had done its job it was switched off but left on the kitchen sideboard			1
' the 44 - year - old house owner , together with his wife and son , then left the house and were not home when the robot set off			2
' somehow it seems to have reactivated itself and made its way along the work surface where it pushed a cooking pot out of the way and basically that was the end of it			0
' it pretty quickly started to melt underneath and then stuck to the kitchen hotplate			1
by the time we arrived , it was just a pile of ash			0
@entity50 from @entity51 ' @entity52 was always depressed ' the entire building had to be evacuated and there was severe smoke damage particularly in the flat where the robot had been in use			1
' i do n't know about the allegations of a robot suicide but the homeowner is insistent that the device was switched off - it 's a mystery how it came to be activated and ended up making its way to the hotplate			1
' it took an hour to clean and make the building safe			0
but the family at least for the moment is homeless as their apartment is no longer habitable thanks to the smoke damage			0
the homeowner said : ' the company that makes the robots is selling dangerous devices , i intend to sue to get compensation			0
it has ruined my home as everything is smoke damaged			0
