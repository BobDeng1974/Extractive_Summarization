the shocking moment a driver was forced off the road when he was cut off by a lorry has been captured in a terrifying dash - cam video			1
@entity5 was driving his van to work when a huge articulated truck pulled into the road ahead of him , apparently without checking for oncoming traffic			1
he immediately took evasive action and swerved his vehicle onto the grassy verge , coming to a stop as the lorry continued down the road without stopping to check mr @entity5 was unhurt			1
mr @entity5 , who was travelling from his home in @entity31 to his fruit and veg business in the @entity35 town of @entity36 , has now posted the video on @entity37 in a bid to shame the driver			1
' i was just driving along listening to music on my way to work and i saw the guy coming from the right side , but i assumed he would come to a stop , ' the 52 - year - old said			1
' but then i just saw the truck come right across and nearly crash into me			0
i thought i was dust			0
everything seemed to happen very fast and incidents like this have happened at this junction in the past			0
shock : the lorry was going at a high speed and did not appear to see mr @entity5 's van emergency : the van driver swerved out of the way of the lorry , dislodging snow from the roof of his vehicle ' after the incident i drove after him and he stopped in a lay - by three or four miles on where i explained to him that he nearly killed me and after that he apologised			1
' i ride a motorbike too and people do it all the time because they 're harder to see , but i do n't know how you can miss a van			2
' the whole point of putting the video online is because people have been trying to get something done about that junction			0
' i have seen so many close shaves there myself and you draw your teeth in , but i think this one was the closest			0
it is happening every week and someone will eventually get killed			0
' visibility : mr @entity5 's windscreen was hard to see through as he swerved onto a grassy verge blind ; the lorry ignored the near - miss accident and simply carried on down the road local councillor @entity89 said : ' i have seen the video and it is just terrible			1
the thing is , there are near misses at this junction all the time			0
' i get emails weekly about this and fortunately this driver saw it coming and took evasive action , which was lucky because there was a lorry coming up behind as well			2
' i think with evidence like this it is crucial that people send in their accounts of things like this happening			0
' a spokesman for @entity112 confirmed they were aware of the incident			2
@entity115 , the company which owns the lorry , refused to comment on the video .			2
