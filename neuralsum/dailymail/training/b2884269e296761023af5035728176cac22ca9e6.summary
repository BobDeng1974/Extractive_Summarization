by @entity0 published : 11:23 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 11:36 est , 18 december 2012 when @entity2 and @entity3 booked a professional photography session , they had hoped to get treasured family snaps of their son @entity6 at just a few weeks old			1
they never imagined it would show up tell - tale signs that he was seriously ill. @entity6 had appeared the picture of health when he was born and no - one was too worried that he looked slightly purple - assuming he was simply a bit bruised by his arrival			1
@entity17 had appeared the picture of health when he was born and no - one was worried that he looked slightly purple - assuming he was simply a bit bruised by his arrival but when the photos were developed , his parents noticed the purple blotches on @entity6 's skin had got worse and his hands and feet looked almost blue			1
this sparked a chain of events that ended in life - saving treatment at @entity30 , where @entity6 was diagnosed with the rare heart defect pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect ( @entity34 )			1
this is a very rare congenital malformation of the heart where the pulmonary valve fails to develop properly , obstructing the flow of blood from the heart to the lungs			1
this is coupled with a defect in the lower chamber walls dividing the left and right - hand side			1
two days after the photo session , mrs @entity3 mentioned her concerns about the blotches to a community nurse who sent them to their gp to get @entity6 's oxygen levels checked			1
unfortunately , the doctor 's surgery had only an adult 's machine available so when @entity6 's oxygen levels were reading at 50 per cent ( rather than the expected 97 per cent ) - it was assumed it was because it was n't a children 's device			1
but when the photos were developed , his parents noticed the purple blotches on his skin had got worse and his hands and feet looked almost blue - and he was diagnosed with a rare heart disorder to be on the safe side , @entity6 was then sent to @entity66 in @entity67 so a proper test could be performed			1
after two hours of trying to get a normal reading , he was sent to the paediatric cardiac centre at @entity30			2
mrs @entity3 , 23 , from @entity71 near @entity72 in @entity73 , said : ' at this point , we were remarkably calm and still did n't think it was that serious			2
' the next thing we knew we were ushered through to a private room and told @entity6 had a very rare congenital heart condition and was critically ill. he was struggling to get oxygen around his body and we were told the next 24 hours were critical			1
' we could n't quite believe how quickly he 'd deteriorated : we went from thinking our son was a healthy newborn to being told his life was in danger within the space of a few hours			2
' in fact , we were told that if we 'd taken 15 minutes longer to get to @entity30 , @entity6 might not have made it - it was almost unbelievable			2
' within two hours of arriving , @entity6 was in theatre as doctors tried to deal with the rare heart condition			1
the condition had affected @entity6 's ability to get oxygenated blood around his body , which is crucial for survival			0
by the time he was diagnosed , his condition was so severe that arriving 15 minutes later at the hospital could have killed him			0
pictured here today , aged two the cause of @entity34 is unknown and it accounts for only around three per cent of congenital heart problems			1
@entity6 remained in theatre for more than 10 hours as consultant cardiac surgeons @entity102 and @entity104 struggled to stabilise him			0
it was a nail - biting time for full - time mother @entity106 and mr @entity17 , 22 , a mechanic			1
' the doctors came through to us to say the next 24 hours were critical and that @entity6 's life was at risk , ' said mrs @entity3			1
' we were told that he would need to go on an @entity112 machine when he came out of theatre , which would keep him alive in what was a desperate situation			0
' extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( @entity112 ) provides both cardiac and respiratory support			0
blood is oxygenated outside the body and returned to allow the heart and lungs time to rest and recover while maintaining a good blood supply to the brain and other organs in the body			1
this technique is a method of life support and is used only when all other options have been exhausted			0
@entity6 , here with father @entity2 and mother @entity3 , may need a lung and heart transplant in the future one of the nurses caring for @entity6 , @entity135 , explained : ' these were some of the worst nights the team had ever experienced as his deterioration was so unexpected			2
he came in looking like a healthy little boy and went downhill so quickly			0
@entity112 really was the last resort and gave us time to allow @entity6 's body to recover			0
' after seven days @entity6 came off the machine but remained in hospital for another four months , undergoing further surgery to reconstruct his heart and help it work more efficiently			2
finally , in october 2010 , @entity6 was allowed to return home			0
he is now two , has a little sister called @entity151 and has a new home more suited to his care			0
but he has now undergone a further 12 procedures and will need to come to the cardiac ward at @entity30 throughout his life			0
he has also been referred to @entity157 in @entity158 to see if further treatment , including the possibility of a heart and lung transplant , will help him			2
' we realise what @entity6 has is n't curable but @entity30 is doing all it can to give him the best life they can , and we 're so pleased to have them , ' mrs @entity3 said			0
' we expect to have many more visits to the hospital but we know we are in safe hands and @entity6 is given the best care we could hope for			0
' @entity172 , consultant in paediatric cardiology , said : ' @entity6 is one of the most complex patients we have ever seen and has been through an incredible journey in his short life			0
' he 's such a fighter and has quite a fan base here			0
we will continue to do everything we can for @entity6 and give him the best outlook in the coming years			0

@entity17 looked slightly purple when he was born , but doctors assumed he was simply bruised by his arrival
had professional pictures taken of him at just a few weeks old
when the snaps came back , his parents noticed the purple blotches had worsened
tests *reveled* he had low oxygen levels caused by rare heart defect
