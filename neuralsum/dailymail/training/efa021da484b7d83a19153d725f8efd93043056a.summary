among groups that have expressed an interest in changing the wedding laws is @entity3 , the organisation that represent naturists and campaigns to combat prejudice against outdoor nudism couples may be allowed to get married naked in naturist weddings under a rethink of marriage law ordered by ministers			1
the prospect of brides walking down the aisle of @entity16 rather than one in a church will also be on the cards in a full - scale inquiry into how and where weddings should be staged			2
the move to reform wedding law follows @entity26 ’s introduction of same - sex marriage			1
the 2013 legislation that allowed gay weddings also said the government would examine changes to the way marriages are solemnised			0
as a result , the wedding law review , ordered by ministers to start this week , will look at sweeping reforms which could allow weddings in the open air or in people ’s homes and gardens			1
it will explore whether weddings may be conducted by non-religious organisations from humanists to political pressure groups			0
a paper published yesterday by justice secretary @entity49 confirmed that among groups that have expressed an interest in changing the wedding laws is @entity3 , the organisation that represent naturists and campaigns to combat prejudice against outdoor nudism			1
it said naturists could qualify to conduct weddings if the rules were changed			1
and , the paper said , there was concern that liberalising wedding law could bring in commercial competition , with rival private wedding companies vying to attract the custom of brides and grooms , and even supermarkets might be turned into venues for couples to take their vows			1
that would mean @entity74 could open wedding parlours alongside its pharmacies and banks , and the co-op could expand its funeral services into an all - round ‘ match and despatch ’ operation			0
independent marriage support groups said it was important that people take their weddings seriously wherever they are held			2
@entity87 of the @entity88 , which campaigns to promote marriage , said : ‘ i have no objection to people getting married jumping out of an aeroplane or on a beach as long as they mean it and the marriage is properly registered			1
a paper published yesterday by justice secretary @entity49 ( above ) said there was concern that liberalising wedding law could bring in commercial competition , with rival private wedding companies vying to attract the custom of brides and grooms ‘ but some of these ideas are just silly			1
i hope there will be guidance for the best man at a nude wedding on where to keep the ring			0
’ at the moment wedding law allows couples to have a traditional wedding in church , under rules set by the @entity116 and other churches with the right to conduct the ceremonies , or a civil wedding in a register office or ‘ approved premises ’			1
approved premises , which include stately homes , hotels and sports ground entertainment suites , have proved highly popular since they were introduced in the 1990s			0
only @entity126 and @entity127 are allowed to marry in their own homes , under laws from 1753 which released them from the requirement to be married by the @entity116			0
@entity132 ’s government tried to introduce a law to allow people to get married anywhere they liked in 2000 , but dropped the idea in the face of the complications involved			2
the 2013 @entity139 said ministers would review whether ‘ non-religious belief organisations ’ , like humanists , should also be able to conduct weddings			1
the consultation response from the @entity145 yesterday said that humanists were anxious to hold weddings in the open air or at places couples find ‘ meaningful ’ , which could mean a preferred holiday beach , the place where they met , a place where a parent ’s ashes were scattered , or even a football pitch			0
but it said that there was a risk that criminal gangs running sham or forced marriages would move in , and that ‘ inappropriate ’ organisations could win the right to run marriages			0
‘ there was a risk that any group , including those with a cult following , could potentially qualify if they could show their purpose as the advancement of beliefs and the ethics associated with those beliefs , or could successfully have it determined that they were being discriminated against if excluded from conducting legal ceremonies , ’ the paper said			2
it added : ‘ the groups identified as a risk included political organisations , @entity184 , @entity185 , radicalised groups and criminal gangs involved in forced marriage			0
’ one critic of reform , it said , feared that pressure groups would try to conduct marriages to raise funds for their cause			0
the @entity145 paper said that the government law reform advisers , the @entity195 , will be asked to ‘ begin as soon as possible a broader review of the law concerning marriage ceremonies			2
‘ an independent review should be able to examine all the issues arising from the consultation alongside all other relevant matters			0
the government will start to work with the @entity195 in january to consider the scope of such a review			2

a wedding law review is to start this week ordered by ministers
paper published by justice secretary @entity49 said naturists could qualify to conduct weddings if rules were changed
reforms could also allow people to get married jumping out of aeroplanes
