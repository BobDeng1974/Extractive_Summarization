by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 24 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:12 est , 24 february 2014 @entity3 was kidnapped and murdered almost 25 years ago by @entity4 and @entity5			1
controversy around @entity4 's execution on wednesday threatens to overshadow her memory friends of murdered schoolgirl @entity3 have expressed frustration that the debate over lethal injections threatens to overshadow the 25th anniversary of her death			1
@entity3 was kidnapped while on her way to school in @entity18 in 1989 , raped and then stabbed to death by @entity4 and @entity5 , who were both sentenced to death			1
on wednesday @entity4 is due to be killed by lethal injection , but last - minute legal appeals over the type of drug to be used have threatened to forestall the execution			1
@entity26 , who was in @entity3 's class at school , has said the focus should be on remembering the ' wonderful spirit ' of @entity3 , not debating the fate of her killers			1
in an interview with the @entity33 , she said : ' we would rather the world focus on @entity3 , and who she was , instead of controversies over death penalty drugs and the death penalty itself			2
' @entity3 deserves to be remembered for the wonderful spirit that she was , and continues to be , for her family , friends and community			0
' on march 22 , the date of @entity3 's disappearance , ms @entity26 plans to hold a ceremony to commemorate @entity3 's life along with other former friends and her parents			1
however the national debate caused by @entity4 's legal appeal over the drugs to be used in his execution mean the event could be overshadowed			1
due to difficulties in obtaining pentobarbital , a powerful sedative used in lethal injections , from a licenced drug supplier , @entity57 officials have been forced to seek out smaller compounding pharmacies to make the drug			2
but the use of compounded pentobarbital is controversial as it has been linked to at least one prolonged , painful execution in the case of of @entity69 , 38 , in @entity70			2
@entity69 , who was executed on january 9 , said he felt his ' whole body burning ' before he died after being injected with compounded pentobarbital			0
@entity4 's lawyers argue that the use of the chemical would cause their client ' severe , unnecessary , lingering and ultimately inhumane pain ' , violating the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment			1
@entity4 ( left ) has argued that injecting him with compounded pentobarbital would cause him ' inhuman pain and suffering '			1
in january @entity69 ( right ) said he felt his ' whole body burning ' after being given the drug the @entity81 , a pharmacy in @entity82 , @entity70 , which was due to supply the lethal chemical for @entity4 's execution , has now refused to do so			1
@entity57 state officials say the execution will go ahead as planned as they have found another supplier , though they have refused to name the company for fear that bad publicity would drive them away			0
both @entity4 and @entity5 have faced execution once before and have been granted last - minute reprieves			1
@entity4 was just hours from death in 2006 when a judge ruled the procedure should not go ahead			2
but despite the controversy @entity3 's parents , @entity98 and @entity99 , say they are determined to see the punishment through			1
speaking to the @entity102 , @entity99 said : ' people talk about closure			0
there ’s no such thing as closure			0
what we want is justice for @entity111 ' while the @entity112 's have so far avoided the executions , @entity98 has vowed to be there on wednesday if @entity4 is put to death			1
he said his drive to see the case through to the end is the thought of what @entity3 went through during her last few minutes of life			0
' that ’s the part i ca n’t stop thinking about , ' he said			0
' that ’s the part that makes them need to have this punishment			0
' lethal injections rely on three chemicals which have been in short supply since an @entity131 ban on exports in 2011 introduced in @entity70 in 1977 , the lethal injection is by far the most commonly used method in executions in the @entity136			1
standard procedure sees iv drips inserted into both arms of the prisoner - one for the injection and another in case the main line fails			0
the convict is then given three chemicals in order to kill them			0
the first is a barbiturate , a heavy sedative which puts them to sleep and will eventually stop their breathing even if the second two drugs are not administered			0
the second is a paralytic , usually pancuronium bromide , which causes complete paralysis of all muscles , including the diaphragm , and would again cause death by asphyxiation if administered alone			0
however in order to achieve the most painless death a third drug , potassium chloride , is then administered which stops the heart and causes death by cardiac arrest			0
but following a ban in the @entity131 in 2011on exporting drugs to be used in lethal injections , a shortage developed			2
licensed @entity136 manufacturers have also been refusing to supply the chemicals required , due to fears over bad publicity			2
now authorities have been forced to seek out small compounding pharmacies which are not licensed by the @entity178 , but can produce the drugs on a case - by - case basis			0
some states have also started experimenting with different combinations of lethal drugs due to the scarcity of those commonly used			0
however , this has left officials open to legal challenges , the most common of which is based on the constitutional guarantee to a death free from cruel or unusual punishment			1
lawyers argue that untested drug combinations , or contaminated drugs from smaller pharmacies , will lead to lengthy , painful and ultimately inhumane deaths			2
in january , @entity69 was executed using compounded pentobarbital and said he felt his ' whole body burning ' before he died , which his lawyers agreed was the result of contamination			0
later the same month @entity204 was put to death in @entity206 using an untried combination of drugs , but appeared to gasp and snort during the procedure which took an unusually - long 25 minutes .			2

@entity3 was kidnapped , raped and murdered in 1989
@entity4 admitted his part in crime and was sentenced to death
anniversary of @entity3 's death will be next month when a ceremony is planned
however controversy over @entity4 's execution threatens to overshadow it
@entity4 is due to be executed wednesday , but has issued a legal appeal over the drug to be used , saying it will cause him ' inhuman pain and suffering '
a shortage of lethal injection drugs in the @entity136 has seen authorities use new chemicals and those made by smaller suppliers
this has meant a spate of legal challenges due to several prolonged and apparently painful deaths during executions
@entity4 was almost executed once before but got a last - minute reprieve
