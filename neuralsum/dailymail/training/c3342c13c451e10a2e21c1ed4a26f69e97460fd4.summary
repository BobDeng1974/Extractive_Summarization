by @entity0 published : 14:41 est , 8 december 2013 updated : 14:48 est , 8 december 2013 fraud : conmen are using fake bottles , such as the ones pictured , to dupe wealthy wine connoisseurs wealthy wine connoisseurs are being duped into buying fake bottles of vintage @entity9 wine , it has been revealed			1
the huge fraud not only sheds light on an increasingly sophisticated counterfeit trade , but highlights how little some self - styled ' experts ' really know about wine			1
one billionaire businessman unknowingly spent more than £ 3million on between 500 and 600 bottles of counterfeit @entity18 wine			1
others are believed to have spent similar amounts of money - but are too embarrassed to confess to being the victims of fraud			2
the fake bottles - most of which were picked up in @entity28 - were exposed by @entity9 customs and fraud agents			1
they are among thousands proved to be fake at a specialist lab in @entity18 , run by the @entity9 @entity34			1
some are outrageous amalgamations of vintage @entity9 wine , such as bottles with labels reading ' @entity40 ' and ' @entity41 '			1
however , others are just trying to give consumers a taste of glamour - with ' @entity46 ' imitating the 1947 @entity47 , one of @entity41 's finest wines			0
to the untrained eye , some of the labels might appear real - but they are , in fact , too new looking and printed on the wrong kind of paper			0
conmen can earn millions of pounds through producing counterfeit wine - with bottles of @entity47 currently selling for a staggering $ 11,5000 at auction , according to @entity59			1
' wines are becoming a currency in themselves , ' said @entity62 , a senior analyst of the alcoholic drinks market at @entity64			0
' and as with every currency , at some point , people want to find ways to manipulate that and make more money			0
' examinations : authenticity tests are carried out on bottles of wine at a specialist lab in @entity18 , @entity41 fake : this counterfeit bottle of @entity9 wine features a label reading ' @entity40 ' and ' @entity79 ' alarmingly , fraudsters are becoming increasingly sophisticated as bottle prices rise due to huge demand in new markets , such as @entity84			1
many purchase old , empty bottles from the most prestigious @entity9 vineyards , so that the wine passes tests that sample the bottle 's glass or inspect the label			1
a recent search on @entity94 revealed several old , empty bottles were for sale , including a 1958 @entity97 , a 1928 @entity98 and a 1971 @entity99 - all of which are some of the most counterfeited wines			2
for this reason , several wineries have begun laser - engraving their bottles with unique serial numbers to deter conmen			1
deterrence : many genuine bottles now feature hologrammed or bar - coded stickers that help prevent fraud @entity113 : @entity114 , of @entity18 's winegrowers ' professional association , holds a bottle of real wine others are experimenting with hologrammed or bar - coded stickers - placed half on the bottle , half on the ' capsule ' ( the foil that covers the cork ) - which will shred if removed			1
the @entity18 winegrowers ' professional association has even created an app - called @entity18 - which provides information on individual wines and wineries			2
@entity131 , who runs the specialist lab in @entity18 , performs authenticity tests on suspected counterfeit wine products on a daily basis			2
counterfeiting has plagued the wine industry for as long as the beverage has been produced			0
in the 18th century , @entity139 ordered the makers of @entity141 to brand their barrels with ' @entity143 ' before export to prevent fraud			0
in @entity28 , criminals took advantage of the country 's weakness : consumers who were new to wine , but had the money to buy counterfeit brands for show			2
this resulted in an explosion of fake products , whose labels featured the names - or near names - of as many famous vineyards and locales as possible			2
today , the counterfeit trade is becoming increasingly sophisticated as bottle prices rise due to huge demand in new markets , such as @entity84			0
it is impossible to know the size of fake wine industry as many sales happen privately - with many victims too embarrassed to report fake products			1
however , experts agree that the quantity of rare bottles from illustrious vineyards being auctioned is just too high to not include fakes			0
these include measuring isotopes to determine which country a wine comes from , and measuring the trace radioactivity of bottles to determine their age			2
neither of these tests is definitive - but when put together , they can generally identify any fakes			0
however , counterfeit bottles still make it into both consumer and business markets across the world			2
billionaire businessman @entity194 , whose cellar includes 43,000 bottles of wine , has become a vocal crusader against fakes after becoming the victim of fraud			0
since starting to collect wine about 40 years ago , he has bought some of the most sought - after beverages in the world - including counterfeit bottles that purported to be part of @entity209 's private collection			1
in total , he has unknowingly spent a staggering $ 5million ( £ 3.05million ) on between 500 and 600 bottles of fake wine			1
mr @entity194 said one of the main issues affecting the wine industry is that forgeries are dealt with in a quiet , discrete manner			0
he said many businessman opt to swallow their losses , instead of admitting their own ignorance - adding : ' there 's a code of silence in the entire industry '			0
@entity227 , who is in charge of winemaking at @entity230 in @entity18 , added : ' i think the ostrich strategy - hiding yourself and saying we 'll figure it out later - is not satisfying			0
' it is best to speak about it openly and let consumers know what means there are to verify that they have the right product			0
' however , it is believed not all wineries feel the same way - with some declaring their wine is ' too good to be faked '			1
renowned : @entity18 is known for its fine wine products			0
