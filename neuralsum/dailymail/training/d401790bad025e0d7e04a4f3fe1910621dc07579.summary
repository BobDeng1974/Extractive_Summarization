woolly mammoths could roam @entity1 again , according to one eminent scientist who believes frozen dna from newly discovered frozen mammoths could be the key to the species ' resurrection			1
stem cell scientist sir @entity10 who is best known for cloning the world 's first mammal , @entity8 the sheep , thinks modern techniques could be used to create a replica of the prehistoric animal			1
while he believes the ancient animal could be re-introduced to the world - an idea reminiscent of @entity20 - there are ethical dilemmas			2
stem cell scientist sir @entity10 who is best known for cloning the world 's first mammal , @entity8 the sheep , thinks modern techniques could be used to create a replica of a woolly mammoth like @entity26 ( pictured ) who is on display in @entity29 having been pulled from the @entity31 permafrost sir @entity10 said told @entity33 : ' i 've always been very sceptical about the whole idea , but it dawned on me that if you could clear the first hurdle of getting viable cells from mammoths , you might be able to do something useful and interesting			1
' ' i think it should be done as long as we can provide great care for the animal			0
if there are reasonable prospects of them being healthy , we should do it			0
we can learn a lot about them			0
' the source of viable mammoth cells could come from a number of frozen bodies discovered in the @entity31 permafrost in recent years			1
the source of viable mammoth cells could come from a number of frozen bodies discovered in the @entity31 permafrost in recent years			1
here you can see frozen tissue and blood the giant beasts lived in the late @entity62 period , tens of thousands of years ago			2
their numbers were thought to have fallen across @entity65 and on mainland @entity66 around 10,000 years ago , probably as a result of hunting by our ancestors as well as a changing climate			0
just last month , the most complete body of a woolly mammoth was recovered and captured the science community and the general public 's imagination about the possibility of seeing the giant creatures walk @entity80 's plains again			2
the baby mammoth , called @entity26 , lived around 39,000 years ago and her body is currently on display in @entity85 , @entity29 , where visitors can see her incredibly preserved fur and tissue			0
the baby mammoth pictured lived around 39,000 years ago and her body is currently on display in @entity85 , @entity29 , where visitors can see her incredibly preserved fur and tissue samples from the little mammoth have been sent to laboratories in @entity98 and @entity80 researchers hope to clone her			0
interestingly , sir @entity10 told the newspaper he is not terribly optimistic about the scientist 's chances as there are many technical challenges			1
writing for academic publication @entity107 , sir @entity10 said in order to clone a mammoth , hundreds of thousands of eggs from closely related species such as the @entity112 and plenty of healthy mammoth cells would be required to even stand a chance of achieving the scientific feat. mammoth cells are needed that still have their dna intact , but they degenerate quickly as the snow and ice that has kept them preserved for so many years melts away			1
the study , published in the journal @entity124 , involved dna sequencing of a large number of mammoth remains found across northern @entity66 and @entity65 sir @entity10 wrote : ' by the time you 've got a bone sticking up in the sunshine , it 's effectively too late			2
you need to get it straight out of the deep freeze , as it were			0
' the process of cloning also requires a female - in this case probably an @entity141 elephant - to provide eggs and carry a baby , which would be part created using a cloned embryo , but elephants themselves are rare			0
sir @entity10 believes it is ' inappropriate ' to collect 500 eggs from the animals when they themselves are at risk of extinction			2
he suggests that the best way to create a woolly mammoth is to re-programme good quality cells extracted from frozen mammoths using modern stem cell techniques			1
sir @entity10 suggests the best way to create a woolly mammoth like @entity26 , whose foot is pictured , is to re-programme good quality cells extracted from frozen mammoths using modern stem cell techniques the cells - if they exist - could be transformed into different types , including sperm and eggs , which could create a new mammoth life			1
the technique has already been used to give birth to mice			0
sir @entity10 thinks it could be 50 years before the technology is developed enough to create a woolly mammoth , but at least the time frame could give scientists a chance to work out if the idea is a good one , in order to avoid a disastrous scenario reminiscent of @entity20			1
scientists are reportedly concerned that a ' modern ' mammoth would not be able to adapt to cold conditions , when its mother lived on hot , dry plains			0
they also worry that the science must be developed enough to create friends for a mammoth very quickly in order to care for the animal 's welfare			0
however , none of these concerns will matter if scientists can not get good quality cells from bodies of frozen mammoths and while sir @entity10 says the prospects of reintroducing the mammoth to the @entity1 is ' fairly unlikely ' he thinks there is a chance			1
heaps of mammoth bones found piled up at the foot of a cliff were initially thought to be the results of @entity206 driving the creatures over the edge			0

sir @entity10 said the best way to create a woolly mammoth is to *reprogramme* good quality cells extracted from frozen mammoths
but he thinks cloning a mammoth presents many technical challenges and ethical dilemmas
the @entity219 scientist believes the best source of viable cells could come from the bodies of frozen mammoths discovered in the @entity31 permafrost
it could be 50 years before the advanced stem cell technology is available to create a woolly mammoth
