researchers have found all manner of nasties lurking between the buttons of hotel remote controls			1
scientists from the today programme 's @entity10 investigated hotel rooms at five major hotel chains in the @entity14 after housekeeping had finished cleaning them			1
filthy : in every room they tested , scientists found sky - high levels of bacteria using an ultraviolet backlight to show up dirt unseen by the human eye , they uncovered suspicious stains throughout the room , such as on a sofa and a curtain			1
the researchers used a special meter which provided readouts of the bacteria counts - areas which scored over 100 on the scale , were seen as having an unacceptable level of bacteria			2
the telephones were found to contain double acceptable limit			0
but the remote controls had levels of up to 498 - which was the highest bacteria reading they measured			1
light switches alarm clocks @entity40 @entity41 curtain rods bathroom door handles remote controls telephones bathroom sinks bathroom floors sofas curtains hotel telephones were found to be teeming with over double the acceptable amount of bacteria further laboratory testing even revealed traces of @entity55 in one remote control			1
another remote was even harbouring the highly contagious @entity59 bacterium , which is resistant to antibiotics			2
bacteria expert dr. @entity61 , a microbiologist at the @entity63 , said : ' this indicates there was fecal contamination on the remote			0
' so perhaps someone used the restroom and did n't wash their hands when they were done			0
' meanwhile , the cleanest areas in the rooms were found to be the light switches , which had readings as low as 6 , and the alarm clocks and nightstands			0
the experts suggested that hotel guests protect themselves from bacteria by washing their hands , using hand sanitizer and wiping down surfaces with a disinfectant wipe			0
the findings come after a previous study , led by @entity86 , an undergraduate student at the @entity88 , and colleagues from the @entity90 , tested for levels of total aerobic bacteria and fecal bacteria in hotel rooms across @entity14			1
they found that the dirtiest surfaces were bathroom sinks and floors as well as tv remote controls			2
surfaces with the lowest level of contamination were headboards , curtain rods and bathroom door handles .			0

researchers found high levels of bacteria in remote controls in hotels
traces of @entity55 and even @entity59 were found , when remotes were tested
study took place in the rooms of five major hotel chains in the @entity14
