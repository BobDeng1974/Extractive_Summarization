@entity0 took acting lessons before standing trial for the murder of his girlfriend @entity4 , a @entity6 journalist has claimed in an open letter to the so - called ' @entity0 '			1
@entity9 - born columnist @entity8 says @entity0 had been tutored by one of her ' close friends ' before taking the stand in @entity14 , continuing that the paralympian was a ' faux hero ' who has ' betrayed people and disappointed his fans			1
' @entity8 's letter reads : ' i have it from a reliable source that you are taking acting lessons for your days in court			1
your coach has an impossible task			1
' video : scroll down for footage from the trial performance ? @entity6 journalist @entity8 accused @entity0 of taking acting lessons for his trial source : @entity8 claims @entity0 has been tutored by a close friend and says he is a ' faux hero ' ' @entity0 , i look at you mewling and puking in the witness stand			1
you truly represent everything that the @entity41 loathes about white @entity6 who live extravagant lives in their expensive laagers			1
' asked about her letter , she told @entity47 : ' i have this information from extremely reliable sources			2
' she also compares @entity0 to @entity50 , who served three years in prison for assaulting a petrol station attendant and for the attempted murder of a black security guard around 1996			2
she said of him : ' @entity55 was cut from the same cloth as you , @entity0			2
' he was given to boasting , vain in all things , narcissistic in the extreme and flying into terrible rages when things did n’t go his way			2
i suspect this description fits you			0
' the @entity65 superstar has frequently wept and been sick during the more difficult moments of his trial			0
@entity4 's mother @entity68 has also accused the @entity6 of acting out , referring to moments he has wept uncontrollable while sitting in the dock			1
in the early stages of his trial dr @entity72 analysed his body language			0
curious : the claims came just weeks after @entity4 's mother accused the paralympian of acting she said : ' @entity0 has to project a complex image of innocence and grief to the mass media and court			1
' his squeaky clean image comes natural to him with his short hair , relaxed wide - eyed response in social interaction and charming smile			0
' what @entity0 has to juggle in court is his three public personas : the boyish wonder he stage - managed for the global media – who will challenge any obstacle and which refutes his disability ; the humble , controlled , grieving @entity0 for public consumption in the courts and the suave flash harry , fast cars , gung - ho image of @entity0 with adoring women draped on his arm			0
' his dramatic , tearful breakdown in court - when the brutal wounds on @entity111 ’s @entity4 ’s body were discussed - is more likely to be conveniently staged			0
i believe such behaviour serves to hide his feelings of sickening guilt and vulnerability			0
' @entity0 admits shooting 29 - year - old @entity4 on @entity117 last year but denies premeditated murder and two counts related to shooting a gun			0
the trail continues on may 5			0
acting ? on many occasions throughout the trial he has been seen cowering in the dock with heads in his hand distracted : the paralympian has even been caught looking at his phone during court proceedings trial : @entity0 admits to shooting @entity4 on @entity117 2013 but denies premeditated murder			2
