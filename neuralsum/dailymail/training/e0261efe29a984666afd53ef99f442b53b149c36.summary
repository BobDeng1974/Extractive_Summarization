by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent in a speech in @entity3 , @entity4 , called @entity7 's government ' bullying and thuggish ' and said the @entity9 's failure to act has encouraged him the @entity9 must take a much tougher line against @entity7 - otherwise no country with a @entity13 population will be safe , @entity4 warned last night			1
the former defence secretary said @entity7 ’s government was a ‘ bullying and thuggish regime ’ , but @entity15 and other leaders had been weak in tackling him			1
in a strongly - worded speech in @entity3 , he criticised the @entity20 and @entity21 for doing little more than threatening to suspend @entity13 from the @entity23 group of major nations - saying it should be permanently expelled			1
he also called for @entity26 air defences to be permanently beefed up to protect the @entity28 republics , and said any planned sales of weaponry should be scrapped			2
‘ we must be firm in our response to this challenge to international law , ’ he said			0
‘ this must be seen as the point where we fundamentally reassessed our attitude to the @entity7 government			2
‘ this can not be a suspension of the @entity23			0
it must be the end of the @entity23 until there is a profound change in @entity13 behaviour			1
‘ the beefing up of @entity28 air defences must be permanent , not temporary			0
@entity26 exercises must become more extensive and frequent and we must halt defence exports to @entity13 , including the 1.2billion euro @entity51 warship order			0
’ he added : ‘ make no mistake , this is an expansionist @entity13 echoing its imperialist past			1
’ @entity13 annexed the @entity57 province of @entity58 last month , and is accused of stirring up nationalist sentiment in the east of the country			0
dr @entity4 said the @entity9 ’s failure to act against @entity7 in the past had encouraged him			1
they did little to punish him for his invasion of @entity66 , or the cyber attack on @entity3 - and the @entity20 failure to oppose @entity70 ’s aggression in @entity71 led @entity7 to draw the ‘ obvious ’ conclusions			0
@entity4 said @entity7 's actions represented ' an expansionist @entity13 echoing its imperialist past ' @entity13 seized control of the @entity57 province of @entity58 in march and has since been accused of stirring up anti-western sentiment in the east of the country ( file pic ) ‘ for too long , the serial bad behaviour of @entity81 has been ignored , ’ he said			1
‘ the strong desire to see @entity13 develop as a pluralistic democratic society has allowed wishful thinking to take the place of critical analysis on far too many occasions			0
‘ what we are witnessing in @entity57 today is not a new @entity13 pattern of behaviour			0
' we have seen a former @entity93 officer , who views the world in the same way the old @entity96 did , biding his time until he perceived the balance of power tip his way and he has been well rewarded for his wait as the @entity9 fails to deliver on some of the most important issues of the day			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity7 watched the reaction of the @entity9 while he bullied @entity57 over the supply and price of @entity13 gas and he saw that we did nothing			1
‘ @entity7 ’s government is a bullying and thuggish regime			1
@entity13 has ruthlessly deployed its gas exports as a strategic weapon			0
' just as a drug dealer gets their addict hooked and can then demand any price they like , @entity7 had no qualms about exploiting the weakness of neighbouring energy - dependent states			0
’ @entity4 also took a swipe at @entity123 first minister @entity122 , saying he is ' astonished and appalled ' whenever a @entity125 politician speaks of their admiration for @entity7 dr @entity4 said @entity13 was already eying up the @entity129 part of @entity130 , and could also seek to increase its influence in the @entity132			1
he also suggested @entity7 would use oligarchs ’ money to influence elections in @entity13 ’s near neighbours			2
‘ @entity7 has observed weak @entity125 leadership , with electorates tired of external conflicts after @entity140 and @entity141 , neglecting their outside space and too focused on increasingly internal short - term interests , ’ he said			1
‘ we must be firm in our response to this challenge to international law			0
this must be seen as the point where we fundamentally reassessed our attitude to the @entity7 government			2
’ in a swipe at @entity123 first minister @entity122 , he said : ‘ i am astonished and appalled when i hear @entity125 politicians talk about their admiration for @entity7			2

@entity4 called @entity7 's government ' a bullying and thuggish regime '
