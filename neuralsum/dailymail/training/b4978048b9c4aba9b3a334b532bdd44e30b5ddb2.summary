pictured are prisoners at @entity33 the report found that the @entity4 misled the @entity35 and public about its torture of detainees at secret prisons around the world after 9/11 , and acted more brutally and pervasively than it had acknowledged			2
' despite the fact that this inquisitorial torture was used by @entity4 agents outside @entity12 territory , this does not remove their responsibility for these deliberate actions , ' @entity16 said			1
' we urge the human rights community , the appropriate international organisations and institutions to pressure @entity51 to disclose the information on rights violations in full ... and hold the guilty responsible			2
' he pointed out that only an executive summary was released and urged international organizations and rights groups to push for the release of the full report and the prosecution of those involved in abuses			0
@entity63 and @entity51 often spar about each other 's human rights records , with @entity0 saying that the @entity12 turns a blind eye to its own abuses while lecturing the rest of the world			1
the @entity71 crisis has brought relations between the two countries to their lowest point since the @entity75			0
@entity0 joins countries like @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity28 , all frequent targets of human rights criticism from @entity51 , to use this week 's report as an opportunity to turn the tables on the @entity12 yesterday @entity29 's supreme leader @entity82 labelled the @entity12 as a ' symbol of tyranny against humanity ' , while @entity28 urged the country to ' correct its ways ' and begin following international conventions			1

@entity122 minister of foreign affairs @entity121 ( pictured ) hoped the report would serve as a ' guarantee ' the torture would never be repeated @entity117 foreign minister @entity126 , whose country is in a strategically critical location between @entity129 and the @entity130 , told reporters in @entity132 the report is being analyzed to determine whether any @entity117 citizens were involved			1
from what has already been read , however ' we see that there was inhumane and really unacceptable torture and treatment , ' he said			0
@entity126 praised the release of the report , saying ' transparency is important , ' but , he added ' this does n't legitimize the torture that was inflicted			0
' ' i hope our friend and ally , the @entity12 , wo n't repeat these kinds of actions , that inhumane acts are not repeated , ' he said			0
speaking alongside @entity126 , @entity122 foreign minister @entity121 said the use of illegal camps and ' unacceptable methods of interrogation ' detailed in the report had been known , but he welcomed the report 's publication			2
' i see it as a sign of the @entity12 distancing themselves from these practices of the past , ' he said			0
' and it should also serve as a guarantee that things like that will never happen in the future			0
' the @entity168 's 500 - page report concluded that the @entity4 inflicted suffering on @entity92 prisoners beyond its legal authority and that none of the agency 's ' enhanced interrogations ' provided critical , life - saving intelligence			2
meanwhile , a number of former @entity4 officials have hit back at the report 's findings , saying it was partisan , one - sided and biased			0
former vice president @entity179 branded it a ' terrible piece of work ' and claimed president @entity183 was fully informed of the programme , and even authorised it			0
former vice president @entity179 ( pictured ) branded the @entity18 report a ' terrible piece of work ' furthermore , the @entity4 never tortured anyone under the legal definition of the word , as asserted by @entity192 lawyers at the time , he said			0
the explosive report could yet open the floodgates for a wave of costly lawsuits for those countries complicit with the programme			0
experts who have spent years working at @entity12 detention centres said yesterday 's report did not contain any surprises , but suggested that now detainees ' torture allegations are supported by an official government report , claimants have far more evidence to back any legal action .			2
