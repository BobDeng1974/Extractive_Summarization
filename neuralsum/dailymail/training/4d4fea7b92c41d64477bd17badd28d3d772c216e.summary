by @entity0 it has been dubbed ‘ @entity2 ' – the herbal supplement for women that claims to boost libido and satisfaction between the sheets			1
launched this spring , the makers of @entity9 claim it works by improving poor circulation , which they claim causes a lack of sexual desire			1
the key ingredient is a @entity16 pine bark extract called @entity17 , plus rose hip extract and amino acids			1
dubbed the ' female @entity21 ' after the little blue pills that treat erectile dysfunction in men , herbal libido booster @entity9 is on sale on the high street taken once a day , this herbal mix is said to encourage blood flow to the reproductive organs and the brain , making sex more enjoyable for women			1
three clinical trials with 255 women published in @entity35 – the @entity36 - found the supplement improved female sexual pleasure			1
all participants who supplemented with @entity9 showed a significant improvement in desire , arousal , lubrication , orgasm satisfaction and also recorded less discomfort and pain during intercourse			1
around 87 per cent reported an improvement in their sex lives after eight weeks , and scientists concluded the pill , on sale at @entity53 at – many would argue – a hefty £ 37.95 for a month ’s supply , ‘ significantly improves sexual function ’			1
the product is the female version of @entity9 for men			1
launched in 2010 , annual @entity61 sales for @entity9 now top £ 10 million			1
so is it really any good ? we asked two women to take the pill and report how it affected their sexual desire … @entity68 , 42 , is an operations manager			1
she lives in @entity69 , @entity70 , with her husband @entity71 and two children revived : @entity68 , 42 , says she had little sexual desire and just wanted to get sex ' over and done with ' having quite a few older friends , i had heard people talk about the menopause and the symptoms that go with it			2
so , when i started noticing i had some of the same things - tiredness , mood swings , difficulty sleeping - i wondered if i was going through the change			2
i was n't sleeping very well which meant i was tired throughout the day and would snap at my husband for no reason			2
i did n't feel like myself but was powerless to stop how i felt			2
in general , i just did n’t feel great and my sex drive was affected by that , too			2
my husband and i were having sex – about once a week – because knew sex was important to the relationship , but i just saw it as something i needed to tick off the to - do list			2
after taking the herbal supplement , she had ' more energy , was less stressed and more interested in sex ' as a woman , desire works differently to men and we need to be in the right mood to be intimate			1
but the way i was feeling meant the mood was never quite right			2
i would have sex but would n't really enjoy it , instead i would just want to get it over and done with			2
’ my husband @entity71 did n't really notice something was wrong with our sex life until i started taking the supplement and it improved			1
then he saw a huge difference in me			1
but before this point , my moods were bad and i was terrified we ’d get to the point where we were n’t having any sex at all			2
then , in november , a colleague mentioned she had been taking @entity9 tablets as one of the participants in a clinical trial			1
knowing it was herbal meant i did n’t really have anything to lose			0
i would n’t have wanted to take a chemical tablet			0
because it ’s natural , it took some time to work - but two months of taking it i noticed i felt different			0
i had more energy , was less stressed and more interested in sex			0
instead of seeing it as a chore i would find myself thinking about when my husband and i could get a moment to ourselves			0
i was more passionate and instead of slapping his hand away if he was being amorous , i encouraged it			0
the quantity of sex we are having is the same , but the quality is much better - and @entity71 has definitely noticed a difference			1
in general , i feel better within myself in so many different ways			0
intimacy is so important in a relationship and now i feel we ’ve got that back			0
i ’d recommend it to anyone who wants to get the spark back in their sex life			0
@entity156 , 33 , is a teacher from @entity157 and a mother - of - three i became single a year ago after a long - term relationship and i was left feeling really daunted by the idea of dating			0
being a busy working mum i never really had time to think of myself and was always rushing around			0
it meant i never really thought about dating and finding a new relationship , until recently			0
no energy for a relationship : busy mother @entity167 said she had no libido , but now feels happier and ready to date again i do n’t want to be on my own forever and would like to meet someone but at the same time , at the end of last year , i was just left feeling exhausted			0
i did n’t feel very sexy or particularly interested in being intimate with someone - the desire to have sex had just gone away - and i knew that needed to change before i would meet someone			0
@entity17 is derived from the pine bark of a tree known as @entity178 ( pictured ) i was also daunted about being on my own and trying to get to know a new partner			1
so , i went to see a sex therapist who suggested i try @entity9			1
‘ she explained it was a completely herbal supplement that supposed to help women with low libidos and who , generally , felt unsexy			1
since it was herbal i knew i did n't have anything to lose , so the sex therapist gave me some boxes to try			0
after just four weeks of taking it , i felt so much better			2
i was happier in myself , i felt more attractive , more feminine and less anxious			0
in turn , my libido came back and i began to be interested in the idea of dating and having a relationship with someone			0
i know that my sex drive was so low before because i was so exhausted – but these pills seemed to reverse that			0
now i ’m confident that when i do meet someone , i ’ll be able to have a full relationship – and will definitely keep taking the tablets .			0
