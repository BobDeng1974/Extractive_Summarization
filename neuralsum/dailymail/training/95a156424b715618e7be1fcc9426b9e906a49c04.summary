lord @entity5 , who was allegedly told to ' f * * * off ' by mr @entity2 before retiring early this year , was named @entity7 at a glitzy @entity9 awards lunch			1

today lord @entity5 , who now sits in the @entity39 , told the audience at the awards bash that @entity37 had been through a difficult period			1
in an apparent suggestion that mr @entity2 's days in his job might be numbered , he added : ' i 've every confidence common sense and good governance will prevail before very long			1
' the room of mps , peers and reporters cheered			0
but mr @entity2 's place setting at the lunch remained empty throughout			0
politicians and journalists gathered at the @entity25 in @entity56 for the 27th @entity57 of the @entity27 mrs may hosted the awards , but struggled at times with technology as the projector used during her speech failed her during her speech mrs may used a series of photographs to poke fun at @entity68 , the constituency of @entity71 mp @entity70 who landed herself in hot water last week for appearing to sneer at working class voters organisers say he had been expected to attend , after he had chaired questions in the commons this morning			1
but a spokesman for the speaker said the invitation had been declined ' several weeks ago because of a prior engagement '			0
awarding the prize to @entity5 , @entity84 editor @entity5 said : ' our winner knows more about the @entity22 and its history than any other living soul – he has , quite literally , written the book on parliament			2
' after the expenses scandal and the demise of speaker @entity94 , it was our winner who plotted the restoration of parliamentary grittiness which has been wonderfully evident in the past few years			0
' he did so with impeccable impartiality			0
he did so with humour , scholarship , charm , a flinty adherence to democracy and the most splendid mutton chop whiskers in @entity9			0
' other prize winners included politician of the year @entity30 ( left ) and @entity31 , who was given a lifetime achievement award @entity108 , who this year became @entity110 's first elected mp after defecting from the @entity111 , was named ' insurgent ' of the year during his acceptance speech , mr @entity30 produced a handkerchief from his pocket bearing a @entity116 mr @entity30 said he was ' honoured ' to receive the award for a second time , having previously been recognised in 2011 after the @entity120 's landslide win in the @entity122 elections mr @entity2 sparked a major row with mps earlier this year when it emerged he hoped to replace lord @entity5 with @entity126 @entity125 the £ 200,000 post			1
in the @entity22 , @entity129 mp @entity128 claimed mr @entity2 had sworn at @entity5			2
in a debate in july , he said : ' now , we do not know why he has chosen to retire early , though his working environment , behind closed doors , has not always been easy , as those in the know have already alluded to			0
' in that respect , despite sir @entity137 having studied @entity138 at @entity139 , being told at least once in front of others to f * * * off by you , mr speaker , would not have encouraged him to stay			0
' at the ceremony mr @entity30 said he was ' honoured ' to receive the award for a second time , having previously been recognised in 2011 after the @entity120 's landslide win in the @entity122 elections			2
the former @entity120 leader said : ' this has been a momentous year for @entity122 and , while the @entity153 campaign may not have won in the referendum , there is no doubt that @entity122 has been changed utterly			0
' with the @entity120 now the third biggest party in the @entity165 with more than twice as many members as the @entity158 , and support for the party surging in the polls , there is a determination in @entity122 to ensure that real progress is delivered			0
