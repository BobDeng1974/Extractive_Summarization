sir @entity0 has revealed the trauma his family went through during his father ’s battle with dementia - and has begged ‘ not to be judged ’ by people ‘ who have n’t been through it ’ for his decision to stop visiting once the disease got worse			1
the former @entity12 all - rounder ’s father , @entity10 , began suffering from rapidly - debilitating alzheimer ’s disease from the early 2000s			1
@entity10 ’ condition swiftly worsened and , before his death in december 2005 at the age of 82 , @entity0 could no longer face the pain of seeing his father struggle to recognise his loved ones when they visited			1
‘ i did n’t want to see my dad like this – all that i was looking at was a cavity of what was my father , ’ @entity0 told @entity40 ’s @entity41 special on @entity42 ’s in the first interview he has given on the subject on television			1
‘ and i said “ mum , you ’ve got to stop going ” but she said “ no i ca n’t ”			1
i said : “ mum you come back and it ’s tearing you apart			0
you sit there , you ’re in tears – he does n’t know who you are anymore			1
he does n’t recognise us			0
” we ’d come in and he ’d look up			0
he ’d have someone on his arm and he ’d say : “ are you staying here ? ” ‘ he had no idea who i was or who my mum was			0
so i said : “ @entity69 , i am making a decision now			0
i have got so many great memories of my father – i am not going anymore and i really wish you would n’t because it ’s not doing you any good			1
i ’m not going because it ’s destroying everything i loved about my father			2
i do n’t want to have to see him like this in this vegetable state			0
” and i just refused to go			0
‘ the way to deal with it for me was not to see him			0
everyone ’s different , and please i beg everyone please do n’t judge unless you ’ve been there because it is horrendous			2
to see someone that you have so much time for , who you spent so much time with , so much quality time with , who drove me around as kid and what have you – i do n’t want to see that person in that state			2
’ @entity0 ’s father had been one of the biggest influences on his sporting career and also his life , but @entity12 ’s leading @entity96 wicket - taker simply could not see someone he loved rapidly disappear mentally anymore			1
@entity0 says his father was one of the biggest influences on his sporting career and throughout his life the former all - rounder did attend a pre-ashes @entity42 ’s @entity100 event earlier this year , however , in order to support a cause which is close to his heart			1
and the @entity105 cricket pundit , who scored 5,200 runs and took 383 wickets in @entity96 , was knighted for his charitable exploits in 2007			0
he has raised more than £ 12million since 1985 by covering more than 10,000 miles on foot and he hopes to continue raising money for various causes – one of them being to help cure dementia			2
the 58 - year - old continued : ‘ i think it was @entity120 who wrote : “ we start life as a child and we end life as a child			2
” that ’s exactly where @entity10 was going – he was going the full cycle			2
‘ so we got him into a home and my mother would go down religiously every day and as this went on , i went with her when i was there			1
it actually came to it where there was no point in going – he had to be sedated to have a shower , he got violent , he lost all his bodily controls , he was totally dysfunctional			0
the @entity105 cricket pundit says it was heartbreaking to see his father develop into a ' vegetable state ' ‘ he was fit , healthy , bright , clever , a sportsman , a father , a grandfather			0
he would have been horrified to see himself and i was n’t prepared to keep on looking at him like that and seeing this person who did n’t even know who he was			0
‘ that ’s why i did n’t go			1
unless you ’ve been in that situation , you ’ve made those decisions and you ’ve seen what can happen – that ’s why i ’m so pleased they seem to be making advances with the disease and they are coming up with medication			1
‘ i know you ’ll never be able to cure it – we probably will in many , many years ’ time – but we can certainly prolong and give that person more quality of life			0
’ @entity0 even believes his mother ’s death was accelerated by the trauma of watching @entity10 slowly fade away			1
‘ it had taken its toll on her to such an extent she had a heart attack - it was just too much for her , ’ he explained .			0

sir @entity0 told his mother she had ' to stop going ' to the specialist home when the disease worsened and his father did *n't* know who she was
‘ i did n’t want to see my dad like this – all that i was looking at was a cavity of what was my father , ' admits the former @entity12 all - rounder
@entity0 believes his mother ’s death was accelerated by the trauma of watching his father slowly fade away *due* to his battle with dementia
