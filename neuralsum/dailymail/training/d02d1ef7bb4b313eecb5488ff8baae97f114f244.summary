@entity11 , who paired with @entity12 during the hoax on @entity3 's @entity14 , has been named the ' next top jock ' of the station and now describes himself as being ' at the top of my game			1
' his comments come despite the fact that the nurse who took his initial call @entity23 , 46 , was found hanged three days after the incident			1
@entity3 djs @entity12 ( right ) and @entity11 ( left ) were responsible for hoax calls to the hospital treating the @entity6 nurse @entity23 ( left ) was found hanged three days after the hoax call			1
mr @entity11 ( right ) has now been named ' next top jock ' at his radio station and said he was ' at the top of my game ' along with the award he has won a trip to @entity36			1
in a statement after receiving the gong , @entity11 said : ' from the start , i felt like i had something to prove to myself ... regardless of all that 's happened in the past few months , i 'm still at the top of my game			1
prank : the @entity3 djs rang king edward vii hospital where the @entity6 was being treated for morning sickness and tried to get information about her condition ' so it felt good to see my name at the top of the final leader board ! ' @entity11 and @entity12 called king edward vii hospital where the @entity6 was being treated last december pretending to be the @entity54 and prince @entity55			1
mrs @entity56 failed to see their poor impersonations and transferred them through to another nurse who revealed some details about her condition			2
the stunt drew widespread criticism with the the hospital 's boss @entity64 saying : ' this was a foolish prank call that we all deplore			1
' three days later @entity23 was found hanged at her @entity69 accommodation			1
only two months ago , it emerged that in one of the three letters she left , mrs @entity56 directly accused the two @entity3 djs of driving her to her death			2
she even said they should pay the mortgage for the @entity79 home where her accountant husband @entity80 , 49 , and children @entity82 , 17 , and @entity83 , 14 , still live			0
in the handwritten note , addressed to her managers at the @entity87 hospital , she said : ‘ please accept my apologies			2
thank you for all your support			0
‘ i hold the @entity91 @entity12 and @entity11 responsible for this act			1
please make them pay my mortgage			0
’ despite the furore , the owners of the @entity3 station , @entity98 , have decided to name @entity11 as its top @entity100 accepting the award the 26 - year - old said : ' if this competition has taught me anything , it 's that there 's a lot of talent in this company			1
' plus it 's given all our announcers access to ideas , ways of thinking and people we might ( not ) normally have day - to - day contact with			2
' mp @entity119 , said giving an award to @entity121 was ' distasteful and disgraceful '			1
the chairman of the @entity123 : ' it is ludicrous that the company that employs this dj , having faced such international condemnation , should have given the award to him			0
' it sends out completely the wrong message at the wrong time for the wrong reasons			0
' the family are still grief - stricken and await the results of the inquest , which will resume in september			0
' twitter users also took to the social network to express disgust at the decision			0
@entity140 wrote : ' i do n't think @entity142 should have received that award			0
that prank caused so much harm , intentional or not			0
' @entity146 added : ‏ ' @entity148 radio prank dj @entity11 gets @entity150 dj award ... wtf ? ? ? be a man dont accept it ... # noshameor not			2
' mr @entity11 's award comes as co-host miss @entity154 is said to be still suffering remorse over the prank @entity121 's reaction is a far cry from the tearful interview he and @entity154 gave in the aftermath of mrs @entity56 's death			1
he said at the time : ' our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of all those affected			0
' obviously @entity12 and myself are incredibly sorry for the situation and what ’s happened			2
we hope that they [ mrs @entity56 ’s family ] are doing ok and they ’re getting the love and support that they deserve and need right now			0
' @entity121 's co-host @entity154 is said to be still suffering remorse over the prank and the nurse 's death - and has reported being frozen out by @entity180			2
of the pair , she is the only one who has offered to travelled to @entity69 to give evidence at the inquest of 46 - year - old @entity56 - expected to be held in september - and remains in limbo with her bosses saying they are working for her to return to work ' at a time that 's right for her '			1
@entity3 's communications minister mr @entity189 has condemned the decision to give @entity121 the award			1
the inquest into the death of @entity23 , pictured with her husband @entity194 , is expected to be held in september he said : ' i think there 's a bit of bad taste involved there , ' mr @entity189 said on @entity202 radio station @entity201			1
' there were some very serious consequences of what was a prank and to be seen to be rewarding people so soon after such an event i think , is just in bad taste			1
' @entity3 author and former @entity14 presenter @entity210 said industry insiders are ' bewildered and embarrassed ' by the decision			1
writing in the @entity214 she said : ' what a slap in the face for @entity218 ’s family			0
what an appalling message to send to staff			0
' did they mean to say : “ get your face out there			0
whatever it takes ” ? ' because that ’s how this is being read			0
and to say it ’s not a good look is a wild understatement			0
' news of @entity121 's award comes after it was reported by @entity236 's @entity235 newspaper that the radio station 's management had distanced themselves from @entity154 , 30			2
an unnamed source told the paper that the producers who were involved in the prank and mr @entity11 had not been having much contact with miss @entity154			2
' it seems as though everyone has gone back to work as though nothing has happened , ' the source said			0
miss @entity154 's lawyers have said she wants to testify at the inquest into miss @entity56 's death			0
the newspaper suggested that @entity154 had been stopped from sending a condolence letter to the nurse 's family			0
as part of mr @entity11 's award trip to @entity36 he will be taken on a tour of the studios of the city 's leading radio station			1
the apparent split between himself and miss @entity154 was not foreseen by either of them when they pulled off the prank in december , as they later admitted in an interview with an @entity3 current affairs tv programme			2
receptionist : ‘ hello , good morning , @entity271 ’ female presenter ( @entity12 , impersonating the @entity54 ) : ‘ oh , hello there			1

she 's stable at the moment			0
' [ @entity302 removed due to patient confidentiality ] @entity12 : ’ i ’ll just feed my little corgis then			2
when is a good time to come and visit her , because i ’m the @entity54 and i need a lift down there ? ’ [ in background : @entity310 , mummy ] ‘ @entity55 ! when can you take me to the hospital , @entity55 ? ’ @entity121 : ‘ when will it be alright to come down and see her ? maybe in the morning or something if that ’s ok ? ’ nurse : ‘ i would suggest that any time after nine o’clock would be suitable because the doctor will be in in the morning and will just be getting her freshened up			1
i would think any time after nine			0
’ @entity121 : ‘ @entity320 still there or has he gone home ? i have n’t spoken to him yet			0
’ nurse : ‘ he went home probably at about nine o’clock last night , to be fair			0
’ @entity121 : ‘ lovely , but are they all ok ? everything is alright ? ’ nurse : [ removed due to confidentiality ] @entity121 : ‘ of course , it ’s hardly the palace is it ? ’ @entity12 : ‘ it ’s nothing like the palace , is it @entity55 ? when are you going to walk those bloody corgis ? ’ @entity121 : ‘ @entity335 , i ’ll go and take the dogs outside ’ @entity12 : ‘ i need to go visit @entity6 in the morning			1
