uniformed inspectors are seen raiding homes and shaming families to an emotive soundtrack from the @entity10 ’s much respected journalist and presenter @entity11			1
one man is apparently left crying on his doorstep , while the faces of some children are pixilated to protect their identity – as happens with genuine documentaries			0
the manufacturer , which trades on the marketing slogan ‘ like it , hate it , just do n’t forget it ’ , appears to have misjudged the response of viewers			0
after the commercial was seen during a break in @entity42 on @entity43 on monday night , the brand ’s @entity37 and @entity38 page were hit with a critical backlash			1
among the many @entity37 complaints , one read : ‘ your new advert is very bad taste			1
animal abuse is no laughing matter and i think it ’s very wrong to jokingly use such a subject as a marketing scheme to increase your sales			0
uniformed inspectors are seen raiding homes and shaming families to an emotive soundtrack from the @entity10 's much respected journalist and presenter @entity11 the premise is that these owners have neglected their @entity1 which are then rescued by the pseudo @entity27 inspectors before the jars are re-homed many animal welfare campaigners have hit back against the advert which they say makes a mockery of child cruelty ‘ people would be more inclined to buy @entity1 if you donated a tiny percentage of each jars sale to the @entity27 to show that you meant no disrespect to the hard work that it does			1
‘ another wrote : ‘ what on earth were you thinking ? ! poor taste , at best			0
’ while a third added : ‘ disgraceful advert ! the implications are dreadful and shame on @entity11 for taking part ! hope you take this off air straight away ! ! ! ! ’ the commercial was seen during a break in @entity42 on @entity43 on monday night however , the critics were matched by a deluge of positive comments from fans who enjoyed the humour and defended what they insisted was a funny message			1
@entity1 apologised to those shoppers who were offended on its website , saying : ‘ sorry you feel that way			2
’ the manufacturer trades on the marketing slogan ' like it , hate it ' it added : ‘ the plot focuses on a fictitious world where teams of people are dedicated to salvaging unused jars and giving them to people who actually eat @entity1 with the only animal that appears being a much - loved family pet			1
‘ we worked really hard to create an ad that we hoped people would watch in the light - hearted way it was intended			0
’ the @entity27 said it understood the concerns of some viewers			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we understand that animal lovers are concerned on our behalf - people either love the advert or hate it			2
' we plan to talk to the makers of @entity1 about how we can work together on animal welfare			1
’ a spokesman for @entity127 , which makes the spread , said : ‘ it is never our intention to cause offence			0
this is the first time @entity1 has been on television for two years and we have made every effort to ensure that this commercial entertains anyone who watches it			2
‘ it ranked highly throughout our rigorous testing process and with clear branding from the outset , as well as the comedic tone , we believe we have created an unmistakably @entity1 ad – people will either love it or hate it and they certainly wo n’t forget it			0
' we hope that everyone will watch and enjoy this commercial in the light - hearted way it was intended			0
