by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:18 am on 14th september 2011 ' @entity3 's toy ' : @entity4 , the @entity5 , admitted only the wealthy can afford rail travel rocketing fares mean that the railways have become a ‘ rich man ’s toy ’ , transport secretary @entity4 admitted yesterday			1
he acknowledged that inflation - busting ticket increases meant that customers who travel by rail have ‘ significantly higher incomes ’ than the general population			0
he added that some fares on the @entity18 had become ‘ eye - wateringly ’ expensive and that the planned new high speed link would probably be out of reach to ‘ factory workers ’			1
his comments to mps on the @entity24 will enrage commuters because the increase is blamed on the government ’s decision to reduce the costs to the public purse of running the rail network			2
' uncomfortable fact number one is that the railway is already relatively a rich man 's toy , ' mr @entity4 told the @entity35			1
' people who use the railway on average have significantly higher incomes than the population as a whole - simple fact			1
' the minister described ticket prices on the @entity18 as ranging from ' eye - wateringly expensive to really quite reasonable if you dig around and use the advance purchasing ticket options that are available '			0
but he insisted that even those who are too poor to enjoy rail travel would still benefit from projects like the planned @entity50 high speed rail link between @entity51 and northern @entity52 - because their bosses will be able to get around easier			1
' if you are working in a factory in @entity56 you might never get on @entity50 but you would certainly be benefiting from it if the sales director from your company is routinely hopping on it to jet round the world from @entity63 in a way that brings in orders that keep you employed , ' he said			1
' eye - wateringly expensive ' : mr @entity4 said it was a ' simple fact ' that people who travel by rail on services like the @entity18 earn more than most commuters reacted with horror last month when the government announced it was changing the formula for calculating fare increases from the rate of inflation according to the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) plus 1 per cent to @entity77 plus 3 per cent			1
with july 's @entity77 remaining unchanged at 5 per cent , it means season ticket holders face a hike in fares of an average 8 per cent in the new year			0
worse still , the 8 per cent rise can be taken by train companies as an average , meaning passengers could face even higher increases in their commuting costs			2
at the time , mr @entity4 said raising fares was ' a difficult decision ' but extra money was needed to guarantee improvements to ensure railways were better value for money in future			0
that would allow us ' to put the era of above inflation rises in regulated fares behind us ' , he added			0
but shadow transport secretary @entity101 said the @entity102 was ' totally out of touch with the cost of living crisis facing commuters ' and failed to understand how ' eye - watering rail fare rises ' would add to the burden on families			1
@entity110 , director of rail customer watchdog @entity111 , said regulating some fares was in passengers ' interests but allowing train companies to set fares on individual routes was ' deeply unfair '			0
transport workers union the @entity119 even warned that the price rises could cost the @entity122 key marginal seats as passengers voiced their anger at the ballot box			2
economic benefits : mr @entity4 said the extra investment higher fares could bring would help executives do business more easily responding to mr @entity4 's comments , @entity132 , chief executive of the @entity133 said : ' @entity4 's description of rail fares as " eye - watering " must lead the minister to reconsider the steep fare rises currently planned by @entity102			2
' far from being simply " a rich man 's toy " trains are also vital for many of those on more moderate incomes who need to get to work , and the government will price many off the railways if it carries on with its plan to increases rail fares at three per cent above inflation over the next few years			0
' instead , the @entity5 's promised fare review must deliver simpler , fairer and affordable rail fares			0

' simple fact ' that train passengers are richer than average @entity157 , says @entity4
claims the ' factory workers ' can benefit from projects like @entity50 - though they ' might never get on '
@entity162 says government ' totally out of touch with cost of living crisis facing commuters '
