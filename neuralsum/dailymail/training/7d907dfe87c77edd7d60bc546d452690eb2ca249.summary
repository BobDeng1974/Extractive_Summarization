by @entity0 published : 04:01 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 04:40 est , 5 july 2013 more celebrities could be arrested and charged with historic sex abuse offences , one of @entity5 's top prosecutors has hinted			2
@entity6 , chief crown prosecutor for the @entity7 , supervised the case against former it 's a knockout presenter @entity9 , 83			1
he has also recently approved the the charging of @entity12 stars @entity13 and @entity14 , who both facing upcoming trials over alleged child abuse			2
more to follow : @entity6 , chief prosecutor for the @entity7 , said he expects more arrests and charges for historic sex crimes @entity14 , 48 , denies 19 sex offences with a child while @entity13 , 81 , denies child sex charges relating to five alleged victims in the 1960s			1
but mr @entity6 acknowledged these cases could just be the ' tip of the iceberg '			1
he said : ' i do n't know how big the iceberg is but what i do know is that in the last year i have dealt with more historical abuse cases than i have ever dealt with in my life			1
' i think that is true of us as an organisation nationally			0
' yes there will be more cases and i have no qualms about it and neither am i ashamed of it			1
' mr @entity6 , who also oversaw the landmark prosecution of the @entity43 sex gang , dismissed claims by critics that the pursuit of historic sex abuse cases has become a ' witch hunt '			1
charged : @entity12 actors @entity14 , left , and @entity13 , right , are both set to go on trial over alleged child sex offences he insisted such vile behaviour can not simply be judged as being from ' another time '			0
he made reference to the recent @entity55 case - the former @entity57 choirmaster who was jailed for child sex offences			0
one of his victims , @entity61 , a 48 year - old mother - of - four , committed suicide during his high - profile trial			0
mr @entity6 said : ' children are children and they always have been children			1
compelling : mr @entity6 said the case of @entity9 showed that victim 's testimony alone is enough to bring charges for historic sex offences ' it really came home to me and i hope it comes home to other people following @entity61 's tragic death			1
' she lived with the abuse she suffered for 34 years and i know from speaking to her family how it impacted on her all her life			0
' just because it happened all that time ago does not mean that we should not deliver justice			0
' the fact that they were not able to talk about it for years is our failure - not theirs			0
' however , mr @entity6 acknowledged that historical sex cases are more difficult to prosecute because they often amount to ' one person 's word against another '			1
he said : ' it 's more challenging but not impossible			0
' recent cases have shown that when you deal with recent allegations of sexual abuse you would ordinarily expect physical evidence , medical , or forensic evidence you might even have witnesses or @entity101			2
' all of that is unusual in historical cases			2
what we do have is very clear accounts from complainants saying what happened to them several years ago			0
' that 's not enough for us , we have to ensure the defendant gets a fair trial - it 's a balancing exercise			0
' there are many occasions when people criticise us for taking a bit of time over it but ultimately we want to make sure that only the right cases are brought to court with the right charges			2
' referring specifically to the case of @entity9 , mr @entity6 added : ' and then , as recent examples have shown , they can so strong and so compelling the defendant can plead guilty and that means it spares the victim from having to give evidence in the first place			1
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
