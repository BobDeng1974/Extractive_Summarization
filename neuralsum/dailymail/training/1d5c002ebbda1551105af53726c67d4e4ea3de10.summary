in the skies over @entity3 in the summer of 1940 , the @entity1 @entity0 was an all too familiar sight			1
but few examples of the @entity3 bomber survived the fall of @entity8 and some 70 years later military historians say there is only one left			1
that unique aircraft has finally been raised from the bottom of the @entity14 in the biggest salvage operation of its kind in @entity19 waters			1
it will eventually be restored and go on display as an ‘ evocative and moving ’ reminder of the young men of both sides who lost their lives in the battle for air supremacy in 1940			2
it was shot down during the ' @entity3 ' in 1940 by @entity35 fighters			1
two of its four - man @entity38 crew were killed as it crashed into the sea , but the other two were captured by the @entity19 and became prisoners of war @entity43 : the team watches as the aircraft is painstakingly lifted out of the sea			0
aviation enthusiasts are excited because the bomber is in ' remarkable condition ' the wreck was salvaged from 50ft of water on @entity52 , off the deal coast in @entity54 , after a three week delay because of strong winds			1
despite being shot down and spending more than 70 years under the sea , it is said to be in remarkable condition			1
it crashed after being attacked by @entity61 fighters on august 26 , 1940 , at the height of the @entity3			1
two of its four - man crew were killed and the other two became prisoners of war			0
the @entity0 – nicknamed the ‘ flying pencil ’ because of its narrow fuselage – was one of the principal bombers used by the @entity38 in the early years of the war , including during the @entity71			0
the recovery of the aircraft from the seabed is a £ 600,000 project by the @entity77 in @entity78			1
its team were able to raise the aircraft by placing metal cables around the strongest part of the frame and lifting it whole			2
success : earlier attempts to raise the craft from the sea bed were thwarted by high winds but the project finally came to fruition today			0
some parts of the aircraft fell into the seas as it was being raised , but the @entity77 tweeted that these parts will be recovered by divers			1
the wings and engines are intact , amazingly recovery : workers secure the remains of the crashed @entity0 , the only surviving one of its type			1
it is known as the ' pencil bomber ' because of its extremely thin fuselage in the air once more : despite the nearly 73 years it has lain on the sea floor , the @entity1 bomber is in remarkable condition , with the wings and engine still attached rise : a salvage worker stands next to one of the @entity38 bomber 's water - damaged engines rise : a salvage worker stands next to one of the @entity38 bomber 's water - damaged engines			1
it will soon go on display at the @entity77 in @entity78 from the depths : the second world war dornier 17 aircraft is lifted from waters of the @entity14 today			1
it was first detected at @entity52 in 2008 in action : a @entity0 bomber similar to the one which crashed into the sea during the @entity3			1
the planes were 52ft long with a wingspan of 59ft , and could carry 2,000lb of explosives while manned by a crew of four			0
none of the aircraft were believed to have survived for long after the end of the @entity139 @entity140 , of the @entity77 , said : ‘ the discovery and recovery of the @entity0 is of national and international importance			2
the aircraft is a unique and unprecedented survivor from the @entity146			0
‘ it will provide an evocative and moving exhibit that will allow the museum to present the wider story of the @entity3 and highlight the sacrifices made by the young men of both air forces			2
it is a project that has reconciliation and remembrance at its heart			0
experts say that apart from being covered with barnacles and teeming with marine life , the @entity0 is largely intact			0
the undercarriage tyres remain inflated although the propellers were damaged when the aircraft crashed			0
@entity163 , a writer on the @entity38 , said the discovery of the plane was a ‘ fantastic find ’			0
he said : ‘ this aircraft is going to be the only one of its type in existence			0
this aircraft is complete and therefore its price from a historical viewpoint is invaluable			0
’ the plane was found on @entity52 by divers in 2008			0
sonar scans by the @entity77 , @entity177 and the @entity178 confirmed its identity			2
the recovery was backed by a @entity182 grant of £ 345,000			0
a two - year restoration will take place at the @entity77 ’s site in @entity186 , @entity187 , and it will later go on display at the @entity77 in @entity189 , @entity78			2
delight : the bomber will eventually be housed at the @entity77 in @entity189 , @entity78 underwater images of the @entity193 lying in 50ft of water off the @entity54 coast			1
it is the only surviving @entity139 @entity8 bomber to be raised from its watery grave in the @entity14 under the sea : the @entity0 bomber lay off the coast of @entity54 and is remarkably well - preserved			2
even the tyre pressure of the landing wheels is believed to be intact			0

@entity1 bomber has lain in @entity14 since the @entity3
part of £ *350,000* project to retrieve the plane and display it at the @entity77
aircraft is in ' remarkable condition ' and the wings and engines are intact
museum staff say they are ' delighted ' that the plane is out of the water
it was shot down by fighter pilots in the @entity3 in 1940
