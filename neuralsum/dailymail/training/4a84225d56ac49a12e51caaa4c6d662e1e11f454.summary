by @entity0 a baby boy born with a rare condition causing parts of his skull to fuse required a four - hour lifesaving operation to reshape and replace parts of the bone , to allow his brain to grow			1
@entity9 was devastated when at a 32 - week scan she was told her unborn child had the rare condition craniosynostosis			1
the condition caused sections of her son @entity15 's developing skull to fuse together			1
at nine months old he was taken into the operating theatre to undergo a four - hour procedure to put his skull back together			1
@entity20 was born with the rare condition craniosynostosis , which causes parts of the skull to fuse			1
where the bone fuses it prevents growth , causing other parts of the skull to ' overgrow ' to compensate and allow the brain to grow at nine months old surgeons told @entity15 's mother @entity9 her son would require risky surgery to correct the condition , reshaping and replacing parts of the affected bone the condition , which affects around one in every 3,000 children , had caused @entity15 's head to grow irregularly			1
ms @entity40 discovered her unborn son was suffering the condition at a 32 - week scan scheduled because she was suffering preeclampsia - a potentially life - threatening condition ms @entity40 , of @entity47 , @entity46 said : ' the fusing meant @entity15 's skull could n't grow out sideways , only forwards			1
as a result he was developing quite an abnormally - shaped head			0
' it meant his development was severely restricted in the first months			2
' there was no choice but to let surgeons correct the problem			2
the operation was n't free of risk - i was so nervous during the procedure that i could n't think straight			2
' the trained midwife was told of her unborn son 's condition after a 32 - week scan , booked because the 42 - year - old was suffering preeclampsia - a potentially life - threatening condition affecting pregnant women , caused by raised blood pressure that can lead to severe fits if untreated			1
she said : ' i was told one of @entity15 's cranial sutures - the breaks between the sections of his skull bone - had fused prematurely			1
' he was the first baby from my area to have been born with it in seven years			0
' normally sutures are able to mould fairly easily as the baby is delivered from the birth canal and to help development , but for some reason , one of @entity15 's sutures had healed over			1
' the fusing meant @entity15 's skull could n't grow out sideways , only forwards			1
as a result he was developing quite an abnormally - shaped head ' - mother @entity9 ' it was a serious concern because the brain needs room to grow			1
' @entity15 , whose older brother @entity93 is 17 , was born weighing 5lb 9oz on november 3 , 2011			1
ms @entity40 said : ' my first words when @entity15 came out were , " my , you 've got a big head , have n't you ? " his body was quite small but his head was large			1
' i made sure he was wearing a hat when @entity93 came in to see him			0
i did n't want the first thing @entity93 noticed about his brother was how different he was			0
ms @entity40 , a trained midwife , said : ' the fusing meant @entity15 's skull could n't grow out sideways , only forwards			1
as a result he was developing quite an abnormally - shaped head ' now two , @entity15 made a quick recovery from his operation , trying to sit up on his own for the first time just three days after the treatment @entity111 is a rare condition which causes a baby to be born with an abnormally shaped skull			1
a child 's irregularly shaped head can cause headaches , learning difficulties and eye problems			0
most symptoms develop later in childhood and usually result from increased pressure within the skull			0
the condition is usually diagnosed after a doctor conducts a visual examination of the skull , although further tests may be @entity129 does it happen ? @entity131 is the result of premature fusion of different secions of the skull			2
it means the skull is unable to grown in affected areas			0
as one area of the skull is restricted , other parts of a baby 's head ' overgrow ' to compensate and limit the pressure developing around the brain			2
the lack of growth in some areas and compensatory growth in others , often leads to a altered head @entity151 common is the condition ? @entity131 is rare , affecting around one in every 1,800 to 3,000 children , according to @entity155			0
three of every four cases affects @entity158 craniosynostosis the primary treatment for the condition is surgery			1
the procedure can be carried out during the first year of your baby 's life , or delayed until later in childhood			0
most children recover well from the operation and the appearance of their skill improves significantly			0
however , around one if 15 children may have on - going problems with their skull 's development as they get older			1
in these cases , often the child will need further surgery to correct changes as they age			2
source : @entity155 ' @entity15 was extremely slow to develop in the first few months while we awaited the date of the operation			1
he could n't even sit up , because his neck muscles were too weak to support his head			2
' i 'd joined a @entity187 group of mothers who were all expecting in the same month and it was upsetting to realise all their children were reaching milestones which @entity15 was nowhere near			2
' surgeons at the @entity192 in @entity193 , @entity194 , told ms @entity40 her tiny son required an operation to remove sections of his skull allowing them to reshape and replace the affected pieces of bone			1
they warned the mother - of - two her youngest child could suffer brain damage as a result of the treatment			2
she said : ' i was extremely nervous because the surgery was not without risk			0
' i learned that in other hospitals some children had not survived , although it 's extremely rare for that to happen			0
' if bleeding starts , it difficult to stop			0
the consequences can be severe			0
' we did n't have much of an option			0
if we left it any longer , then his brain would become severely restricted			0
' nevertheless , i made two return trips to hospital to talk to the surgeons before making my mind up			0
it turned out the surgeons were absolutely fantastic			0
' during the four - hour operation @entity15 did experience some bleeding and required an urgent blood transfusion			1
ms @entity40 said : ' i tried to keep my mind occupied while @entity15 was in theatre			2
' after a while i went back up to the ward to see if there were any developments			0
' when i got there i noticed that his cot had been taken away			0
i thought , " my @entity235 , what 's happened ? " ' it turned out that the surgeons had simply requested for @entity15 's cot to be taken to the operating theatre so he could be placed in it			1
' @entity15 made a quick recovery , attempting to sit up by himself for the first time three days after surgery			1
ms @entity244 praised the ' fantastic ' surgeons at the @entity192 in @entity193 , @entity194 for saving @entity15 , pictured shortly after he was born in november 2011 the now two - year - old has since been diagnosed with a chromosomal deletion disorder and developmental challenges which affects his ability to learn to walk and crawl , and his sensory perception			1
ms @entity40 said : ' he 's two - and - a - half now and he 's only just started to walk , so he 's got some way to catch up			2
his development only truly began after he had the surgery			0
' he 's a great little boy			0
he 's extremely cheeky and laughs a lot , but he can be a monster too - a normal two year old , in other words			2
' he 's got a lot of challenges but he 's doing well			0
' the consultants were amazing at the time of the surgery and i 've got lots of specialists - speech therapists , physiotherapists and health visitors within reach			1
' ms @entity40 has found a network of support among other parents at the @entity187 group of @entity274 , a charity supporting families with craniofacial conditions in the @entity277 and overseas			0
she said : ' when you 're a parent facing these conditions it 's easy to feel alone , but the truth is there are thousands of families out there who know what you 're going through			0
