the glamorous new lady of @entity1 has told of her regret that her father - in - law the @entity4 chose to boycott her wedding two months ago			1
@entity6 , daughter of a @entity8 oil tycoon , became @entity10 ’s first black viscountess when she wed lord @entity4 ’s son and heir @entity11 , @entity13			1
but the eccentric lord @entity14 , nicknamed the @entity15 of @entity1 for his string of ‘ wifelets ’ , stayed away from the nuptials after a furious dispute over the moving of some of his famous erotic murals from the couple ’s apartment within the stately home			1
regret : @entity6 , has spoken of her regret that her father - in - law did not attend her wedding ‘ it ’s very sad he did n’t come to the wedding and that the misunderstanding has escalated to this point , but what can i do ? ’ @entity6 says in an exclusive interview with @entity36 ’s @entity35 today			1
‘ i hope in time it can all be resolved			0
’ in an attempt to assuage her father - in - law , she added : ‘ i can assure you that none of the murals that were previously in place in our apartment have been “ binned ”			1
‘ the ones @entity46 has moved have been very carefully preserved			0
’ @entity46 , 39 , took over the running of @entity1 and its safari park three years ago , and his engagement and marriage to @entity6 was welcomed by many as bringing a breath of fresh air to the @entity10 aristocracy			2
' because we have this shared background , @entity46 and i are very comfortable with each other ' @entity6 and @entity46 on their wedding day @entity61 in 2002 in the nursery at @entity1 , which he painted between 1970 and 1980 but @entity6 , 27 , whose mother is socialite @entity64 and who has known her husband since she was four , insisted she would run a more old - fashioned household at @entity1 than the bohemian lifestyle preferred by @entity4 , 71			1
‘ i like the traditional way , ’ she says , adding she prefers dressing up to dressing down			0
it is believed @entity14 , who spends most of her time in @entity72 , objected to @entity6 marrying her son at @entity1 because she thought her too ambitious and keen to use @entity1 to promote her career as a cook			1
undeterred , @entity6 insists that she would like to expand her healthy cookery ‘ brand ’			2
she jokes her new family name – @entity11 – makes a neat fit with a career as a celebrity chef			0
@entity6 also believes children will bring @entity1 to life			2
‘ to maintain a place like this , you need to move with the times			0
it ’s a special thing to be treasured , but it needs to have lots of youth and energy to be alive			0
‘ i guess i ’m young to be getting married and thinking about babies but i feel , hopefully , i will be able to get on with it as soon as it happens			0
i think i want two children – i say that now but i might get addicted and have , like , ten ! ’ @entity97 , @entity98			0
