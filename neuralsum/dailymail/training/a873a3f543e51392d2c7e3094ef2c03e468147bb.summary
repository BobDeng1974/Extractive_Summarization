by @entity0 published : 06:40 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 10:09 est , 18 september 2013 this is the dramatic moment a ferocious lightning bolt crashed against the @entity3 as dusk fell over one of the world 's greatest natural wonders			2
the spectacular images captured the breath - taking landscape , which is thought to be 17million years old , being electrified into life as mother nature fired the fierce bolts towards the canyon walls			2
huge streaks of white light illuminated the surrounding skies as the thunderstorm 's gloomy , grey clouds gathered in @entity20 in front of the setting sun. electrifying : stunning images show lightning striking the @entity3 landscape : photographer @entity26 managed to capture multiple strikes hitting the canyon under atmospheric stormy skies			1
natural : the @entity3 is awe - inspiring as it is , but these jaw - dropping shots of lightning bring more drama to the natural wonder using low exposure techniques , photographer @entity26 managed to capture multiple strikes hitting the canyon under atmospheric skies for the photo titled ' @entity39 at @entity3			1
mr @entity26 specialises in taking photos of wide - ranging landscapes			1
he told @entity42 : ' it was such a wonderful experience to witness this beautiful thunderstorm far across the @entity3			2
' in his blog , @entity45 , he wrote : ' the raw power of it thrilled me equally as much as the fragility and simplicity in a picture of a seagull flying with the ocean gusts			0
' @entity55 , @entity56 and i decided to do a sunset trip to the @entity3 , a two hour drive from @entity59			0
the evening and sunset was very hazy			0
so we decided soon to return home , taking it slow and visiting some more viewpoints			0
' and then , at the @entity65 , we could enjoy this incredible lightning storm emerging at the east end of the canyon			0
' gloomy : grey clouds gather over the @entity3 as lightning starts to strike in the distance next to a break in the clouds backdrop : @entity26 used low exposure techniques to capture multiple strikes , which are caused by humid conditions in late summer according to the @entity81 , @entity79 alone averages more than 26,000 lightning strikes per year			1
the lightning strikes are a probable result of the late summer @entity85 , where storms can be seen every day in a variety of locations across the area			1
the monsoon delivers waves of moisture from the southeast , causing dramatic , localised thunderstorms fueled by high temperatures			1
the other time the area receives showers is during winter when @entity100 storms deliver widespread showers and snow at the highest points the @entity3 is 277 miles long , up to 18 miles wide and is of over a mile			2
nearly two billion years of the @entity106 's geological history has been exposed as the @entity107 and its tributaries cut their channels through layers of rock while the @entity112 was lifted			0
recent evidence suggests the @entity107 established its course through the canyon at least 17 million years ago			0
since then , the @entity107 has continued to erode and form the canyon to its present - day configuration			0
before the storm : @entity26 took some stunning shots of the floor of the canyon and its surrounding walls before the lightning bolts arrived clouds gathering : the gloomy sky starts to form over the @entity3 as late summer conditions begin create variable weather over @entity20 dusk : photographer @entity26 captures a glimpse of the sun before it drops over the horizon			1

photographer @entity26 captured the multiple strikes under the stormy skies as the sun set over @entity20
the area experiences localised *thundertsorms* in the summer as high temperatures *combine* with moisture
