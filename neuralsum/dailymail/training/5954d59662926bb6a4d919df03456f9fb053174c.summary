wind farms have just half the useful lifespan which has been claimed , according to new research which found they start to wear out after just 12 years			1
a study of almost 3,000 turbines in @entity6 – the largest of its kind – sheds doubt on manufacturers claims that they generate clean energy for up to 25 years , which is used by the government to calculate subsidies			1
professor @entity14 , an economist at @entity15 and former energy advisor to the @entity17 , predicts in the coming decade far more investment will be needed to replace older and ineffective turbines – which is likely to be passed on in higher household electricity bills			1
new research : wind farms have just half the useful lifespan which has been claimed , according to new research which found they start to wear out after just 12 years he said the performance of the @entity6 ’s wind turbines over the past 11 years had ‘ deteriorated markedly ’ and that ‘ the subsidy regime is extremely generous if investment in new wind farms is profitable despite the decline in performance due to age and over time			1
’ the research will fuel criticism of wind farms which are already unpopular among many local communities who say they blight the landscape , generate noise and may disrupt wildlife			1
but the government which plans to increase the number of turbines from the current 3,873 to 10,000 within the next decade , insists they are essential to fight climate change			0
predictions : professor @entity14 , an economist at @entity15 and former energy advisor to the @entity17 ministers are currently drawing up plans to compensate local communities affected by them with investment – which have critics have dismissed as bribery			0
prof @entity14 ’ study of 280 wind farms in @entity6 and more than 800 in @entity53 from 2000 to 2011 , found the larger wind farms typical in @entity6 are less effective than smaller ones			1
in @entity53 , where wind power has been used for longer , the decline in output was less dramatic , which he said could be down to their smaller size and possibly better maintenance			0
for onshore wind , the monthly ‘ load factor ’ of turbines – a measure of how much electricity they generate as a percentage of how much they could produce if on at full power all the time - dropped from a high of 24 per cent in the first year after construction , to just 11 per cent after 15 years			1
for offshore wind – examined only in @entity53 where it has been used for longer - it declined even more dramatically from over 40 per cent at the start , to just 15 per cent after ten years			2
he believes they become uneconomic after around 12 years			0
the decline in output was put down to wear and tear of the blades , and more frequent breakdowns for older turbines			0
his report for the anti-wind farm charity the @entity84 ( @entity85 ) , noted : ‘ onshore wind turbines represent a relatively mature technology , which ought to have achieved a satisfactory level of reliability in operation as plants age			2
unfortunately detailed analysis of the relationship between age and performance gives a rather different picture … ’ prof @entity14 told the @entity99 the trend for larger wind turbines in @entity6 , which reach up to 400feet tall in some areas increased wear and tear			1
future : the research predicts in the coming decade far more investment will be needed to replace older and ineffective turbines - which is likely to be passed on in higher household electricity bills he added : ‘ i strongly believe the bigger turbines are proving more difficult to manage and more likely to interfere with one another			2
’ he said the data was verified by a statistician at @entity115			0
it will give ammunition to many @entity119 mps who are sceptical about the merits of wind farms and believe the subsidies given to the industry are too high			1
more than 100 wrote to the prime minister this year saying they were inefficient			0
but the @entity126 say wind produced enough energy to power 2.4million homes in 2011 and they hope this will increase to 7.7million by 2020			2
a spokesman said : ‘ our expectations of wind turbine lifetimes are based on rigorous analysis and evidence			0
@entity6 ’s oldest commercial turbines at @entity138 in @entity139 have only recently been replaced after 20 years of operation , and the technology has come on leaps and bounds since that project started generating in 1991			1
‘ consumer support for renewable power is based on the actual power generated			0
that ’s why it is in the interest of wind farm operators that they keep their turbines well - maintained and running at optimum capacity			2
’ the wind farm industry point out that turbines are improving all the time , and say that subsidies are only paid when turbines produce electricity so there is a strong incentive for operators to protect them from wear and tear .			0
