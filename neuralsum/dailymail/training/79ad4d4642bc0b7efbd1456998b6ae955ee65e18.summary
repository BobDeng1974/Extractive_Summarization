a woman claims the air conditioning in her office helped save her life after she discovered a lump in her breast as she hugged herself to keep warm			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , had always complained about the air con being on , even in the middle of winter			1
now she credits it with saving her life , after it alerted her to the tumour last december			1
the 35 - year - old , said : ' it was a freezing cold morning and the air - con was on full blast			1
i think it was colder in the office than outside			0
@entity6 , 35 , had a cast of her new chest created after losing both her breasts to cancer ( right )			1
before she was diagnosed ( left ) she found a lump but thought she was too young to get breast cancer ms @entity6 discovered the lump after her hugging herself to try and warm up in her air conditioned office and now credits the air con with saving her life after a double mastectomy , ms @entity6 found out she could n't have reconstructive surgery until it was certain she was cancer - free			1
she says she struggled to accept her new body ms @entity6 celebrated her 34th birthday with friends days before she found a lump in her breast that turned out to be cancerous ' i hugged myself to try and keep warm and felt a small grisly lump about the size of a grape			1
' after asking a colleague to examine it , i decided to mention it to my doctor at a check - up i 'd booked for something else three days later			1
' the office manager , who also volunteers for homeless charity crisis , took her mother @entity48 , 70 , who is also a breast cancer survivor , along with her for support			1
while she was aware of the history of cancer in her family , having just celebrated her 34th birthday ms @entity6 thought she was too young for the lump to be anything serious			1
but by the time of her appointment , the lump in her left breast had swollen to the size of a golf ball and the gp also found a smaller growth in her right breast			1
' i was sent to hospital for scans and it was then i started to worry , ' she said			0
' @entity68 had been diagnosed with breast cancer five years earlier so i knew what could be ahead			2
' getting started start with a visual exam			0
look in the mirror with your arms over your head and then with your hands on your hips being sure to check both the front of your breasts as well as the sides and ask yourself : do my breasts look the same ? are my nipples the same shape ? are there any indentions , bruises or bulges ? is there any discharge coming from my nipples ? are the veins more noticeable on one breast than the other ? @entity94 next , lie down on your back with one hand behind your head			1
this flattens the breast tissue against the chest wall and makes it easier to evaluate			1
use the pads of your three middle fingers from your opposite hand to examine each breast			2
step 2 move your three fingers in penny - sized circles			0
do three circles in one spot , starting with light pressure , then medium and lastly use deeper pressure			0
now ' walk ' your fingers to the next area			0
do not lift your fingers off your breast , ' walk ' them to the next spot			2
step 3 starting at your breast bone , work your way down your breast and back covering your entire chest			1
continue to do penny - sized circles , moving into the armpit area continuing all the way into the inside of your arm			0
your last line will be up your side just below the outer edge of your breast , finishing on the inside of your armpit			2
step 4 be sure to spend extra time in the armpit			0
it 's important to go all the way to the inner arm area to make sure you cover all the lymphatic systems in your armpit and arm area , as this is where many breast cancers develop			2
repeat these steps for both breasts			2
step 5 lastly , gently squeeze each nipple			0
you are looking for any discharge or pain			0
some women normally have breast tenderness around the time of their period			2
the best time to check your breasts is about a week after your period ends			2
it 's important you check at the same time every month			0
remember you are looking for differences from what is normal to you			0
the more you get in the habit of checking your breasts the more you know what is ' normal ' for you			2
if you notice any changes , make an appointment to see your doctor immediately			0
source : @entity163 after an ultrasound , mammogram and biopsy , ms @entity6 had to wait three weeks for her results			1
she said : ' it was surreal			0
i was celebrating @entity171 , but i did n't know what the future held for me			2
' she eventually found out the lumps in both breasts were stage 3 cancer - where the cancer is more developed , there are cancer cells in the lymph nodes and there is a risk it has spread to the surrounding tissues			2
she was told she would need eight rounds of chemotherapy and a double mastectomy			1
' i 'd prepared myself for the cancer part , i just could n't come to terms with the fact i would lose my breasts , ' said ms @entity6			1
' doctors said that even if chemo did destroy the cancerous cells , i 'd still need a double mastectomy to be sure i was cancer free			1
' ms @entity6 cut her hair short in preparation for chemotherapy , but after six sessions she had a reaction			1
she said : ' i got a tingling feeling in my hands and feet which got worse			0
at one point i could n't even do up buttons			2
' my doctor decided i should have the mastectomy then complete my course of chemo			2
during the operation i 'd also have a breast reconstruction			2
' however , prior to surgery , an mri scan showed that the cancer could be spreading			2
' it meant i could n't have the breast reconstruction until they knew i was cancer - free , ' she said			1
' it was another blow			0
' afterwards , with my mum by my side , i looked down at my flat chest			0
' i do n't think it 's something i 'll ever completely come to terms with but two months on , i did start to feel more comfortable with my body			0
' while researching breast cancer on the internet ms @entity6 came across a charity called @entity232 , which uses art to help prevent the disease			1
intrigued , she went along to see the charity 's art display and ended up meeting the artist			0
she said : ' the founder @entity238 was holding an exhibition of her work			0
' she makes plaster casts of breast cancer survivors ' chests , and then sends them off to be painted vibrant colours			1
' i met @entity238 and she showed me her work			0
it was so inspiring and powerful			0
' two days later she asked if i would be interested in having a cast made , and i jumped at the chance			1
' it 's not finished yet but i ca n't wait to see the final version , which will be displayed in her studio			0
' it shows how far i 've come , and how important it is to know what 's happening with your body			0
' ms @entity6 , who is hoping to have reconstructive surgery in the future , is now urging women to carry out monthly self - checks , particularly young girls who see breast cancer as an older woman 's issue			1
she 's working with @entity163 to spread the message using the hashtag , # @entity266			0
ms @entity6 took her mother @entity48 , 70 , a breast cancer survivor to the initial appointment for support			1
here the pair are pictured on holiday in @entity273 ms @entity6 has run a @entity274 to raise money for breast cancer and is working with @entity163 to spread the message about carrying out monthly self - checks they 're encouraging people to download the app @entity282 , which helps you master the breast self - exam			1
looking back , ms @entity6 said she is grateful her office was so cold , because it led to her being diagnosed with cancer before it was too late			1
she said : ' if i had n't hugged myself that day , things could 've been very different			0
' so now i want to encourage women to do it properly			0
' being cold saved my life			0
i never thought i 'd be thankful for the office air con			1

@entity6 , 35 , always complained the air con was on all year round
hugging herself to warm up she discovered a small lump in her left breast
within three days it had grown to the size of a golf ball , she says
doctors also discovered a tumour in her right breast after running tests
ms @entity6 was told she would need to have both breasts removed , but *complications* meant she could n't have reconstructive surgery
after a double mastectomy , she had a plaster cast of of her chest made
