by @entity0 last updated at 10:28 am on 27th september 2011 @entity1 insisted @entity2 was not ‘ profligate ’ with taxpayers ’ money yesterday – while demanding £ 44billion of extra government spending			1
the @entity6 suggested @entity7 should immediately pump nearly £ 23billion of public cash into the economy to kickstart the recovery			1
and he said @entity2 opposes a further £ 21billion of cuts the government is already making			1
mr @entity1 sought to win back authority for @entity2 on the economy by saying he would submit to ‘ iron discipline ’ on spending if the party gained power again			1
speech : @entity1 , pictured addressing the @entity2 conference in @entity21 , has set out a five - point plan for economic growth but he was accused of having ‘ zero credibility ’ because he flatly refused to apologise for @entity2 ’s wasteful use of public cash , which left @entity7 vulnerable before the financial crash			1
opponents also pointed out that he could make all the extravagant claims he wants because , with an election up to four years away , they will never be tested			2
‘ do n’t let anyone tell you that @entity2 in government was profligate with public money , ’ he told the party conference in @entity21			1
and later at a fringe meeting , he said he has no intention of apologising for @entity2 ’s public spending record			1
‘ i do n’t believe in a mea culpa strategy , ’ he said			2
‘ the @entity40 would like nothing better than for me to say that public spending caused the crisis but it ’s just not true			1
i think politically it would be very foolish			2
’ in his first speech to conference as shadow chancellor , he set out a five - point plan to kick - start the flagging economy			1
he called for an immediate one - year cut in vat to 5 per cent on home improvements , repairs and maintenance			1
the @entity57 said that would cost £ 2.2billion – four times mr @entity1 ’s estimate of £ 500million			1
he also demanded a one - year national insurance tax break for every small firm which takes on extra workers – a fresh cost of £ 900million			1
ovation : mr @entity1 is congratulated by @entity2 's deputy leader @entity65 after his speech leadership : ms @entity65 , mr @entity1 and mr @entity68 at the side of the stage eastern @entity72 workers should face restrictions on their movement to prevent big business benefiting from ‘ cheap labour ’ at the expense of @entity7 workers , one of @entity68 ’s closest advisers said yesterday			1
@entity80 , a personal friend of the @entity2 leader , also said @entity83 trawlers should be restricted from fishing in @entity7 waters			1
in a @entity87 - tinged intervention at the party conference , the peer launched a stinging attack on @entity2 , saying it had built a strong economy before the recession on the back of cheap labour from abroad			1
@entity80 called on mr @entity68 to challenge the @entity94 on its doctrine of free movement of labour			2
‘ the idea that workers in @entity100 are working in an equivalent economic space to workers here is just not true , ’ he said			2
‘ wages are far , far lower there so the incentives to move and come where wages are higher – that disrupts family life , that disrupts economic growth in @entity100 and creates a dependent culture			2
i think we should have a treaty change to stop it			2
the idea that treaties can not be negotiated is anti-political			2
’ at another fringe meeting , former communities secretary @entity117 admitted that under @entity2 , ‘ immigration was too high , too fast ; communities changed before people ’s eyes and put strain on public services ’			1
she added : ‘ this is how people feel			2
it ’s almost like we ’re frightened to say it			2
i think we got this sense that we have got this great melting pot which is @entity132 and some of our big cities			2
but that ’s not necessarily reflected in other communities			0
‘ we ca n’t have a party that ’s simply @entity132 - centric that looks through the prism of a very multi-cultural community but also a very middle - class community			0
that is n’t the reality for very many people out there			0
’ mp @entity145 said mass immigration was here to stay and politicians are ‘ lying ’ if they claim they will slash it			0
she said all parties should stop ‘ competing on numbers ’ and instead focus on tackling feelings that the system is unfair			0
she insisted the government ’s vow to cut net immigration to the tens of thousands ‘ will fail ’			0
mr @entity1 said @entity2 would reverse january ’s rise in @entity157 – costing £ 12.1billion – and bring forward capital investment projects at a likely cost of £ 8billion			1
call it @entity163 it @entity165 i do n’t care want they call it – @entity7 just needs a plan that works , ’ he said			2
his aides claimed the proposals would be financed by slowing the speed of deficit reduction – condemning @entity7 to years more with the national credit card in arrears			0
mr @entity1 admitted that if @entity2 won power in 2015 he would not be able to reverse all the @entity177 ’s austerity measures			1
but he condemned cuts to the police , child benefit , tax credits , pensions , the axing of the @entity184 and regional development agencies			2
without those savings , government borrowing would be £ 21billion higher than now – bringing the black hole in @entity2 ’s plans to a staggering £ 44billion			1
mr @entity1 acknowledged that there was no area in which it was more important for @entity2 to win the public ’s trust than on the economy			1
with the world facing ‘ the darkest , most dangerous times for the global economy in my lifetime ’ , @entity7 is threatened with ‘ a lost decade of economic stagnation ’ if growth is not revived , he warned			0
the @entity204 programme of deep and swift cuts is ‘ not working ’ and risks plunging the world into a 1930s - style depression , he added			1
mr @entity1 claimed @entity2 bequeathed the @entity177 a golden economic inheritance			1
in fact total debt rose between 1997 and 2010 from a little under £ 350billion to more than £ 550billion			1
the highly respected @entity212 has concluded : ‘ on the eve of the financial crisis , the @entity7 had one of the largest structural budget deficits among either the @entity217 or the @entity219 countries			0
’ and both @entity220 and former chancellor @entity221 have admitted that @entity2 was spending too much			1
mr @entity1 sought to curry favour with voters by admitting @entity2 made mistakes on bank regulation , the 10p tax rate , @entity228 ’s paltry 75p pension rise and on immigration from @entity230			1
but he also resorted to a crude class - war attack on @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 , saying those with ‘ independent means ’ did not care about those suffering in the downturn			0
@entity239 , the economic secretary to the treasury , said : ‘ this speech failed the credibility test			0
everyone can see that @entity1 is dangerously addicted to debt			1
a teenage schoolboy became the star of the @entity247 and was hailed as ‘ brilliant ’ after a rousing speech in which he ripped into the ' vicious ' @entity177			0
in echoes of a teenage @entity251 addressing the @entity204 conference in 1977 , @entity249 received a standing ovation from thousands of delegates and had @entity68 rushing to shake his hand			0
@entity249 , 16 , who lives with his mother @entity256 and eight - year - old sister @entity257 in @entity258 , @entity259 , had the week off school to attend the @entity261 became involved with politics after his family home was repossessed as his mother struggled to find work			0
@entity266 : 16 - year - old @entity249 from @entity258 addresses the @entity247 conference he told thousands of activists : ‘ two - and - a - half years ago , the home i had lived in since birth was repossessed			0
‘ i owe my entire well - being and that of my family to the welfare state			0
that is why i joined the @entity247			0
‘ that very same welfare state is being ruthlessly ripped apart by a vicious , right - wing , @entity204 - led @entity277			0
‘ i would n’t be here today if it was n’t for that system , that safety net			0
so i take this opportunity to plead with the government to reconsider their measures			0
‘ their measures for young people , which will divide a generation and seriously threaten the @entity7 promise that @entity68 has spoken about , where one generation does better than the last			0
' their measures on welfare , such as the housing benefit cap , which will potentially make 40,000 people homeless and hammer the most vulnerable people in society			0
’ his impassioned plea was hailed as ' brilliant ' by @entity1			0
@entity249 is studying four a-levels – @entity302 literature , geography , politics and history – at @entity306 in his home town , having gained seven @entity308 in his gcses			0
after the speech , he said : ‘ i think a lot of my friends are quite angry at what this government is doing with tuition fees			0
' it 's important to get more young people involved			0
' @entity249 , who only joined the party after the last general election , said he did not know what he wanted to do after school but added he would ' quite like to go into politics in the future ' .			0
