@entity7 had to undergo open heart surgery just hours after being born and surgeons warned he might not survive			1
even after the surgery , he suffered a huge heart attack , underwent two more operations , and was hospitalised countless times after developing infections			1
@entity7 was born with half a heart and was given just a 50 per cent chance of survival			1
he has amazed medics by flourishing - and his mother believes it is thanks to his swimming lessons but ever since his mother , @entity21 , 26 , first took him to the pool the one - year - old has flourished			1
ms @entity21 , a nursery practioneer from @entity25 , said : ‘ he just seems to thrive in the water and it seems to have helped him since day one			0
‘ i 'm no doctor but i certainly believe it has helped him so much with his recovery and we go every week			0
‘ when he is running around he can get so breathless - but not in the pool			0
he can just get that exercise which has to be good for his heart and make it stronger , with the support of the water			0
‘ i 'm not a cardiologist but it has given him a huge step in the right direction			0
‘ his cardiologists ca n't believe how well he is doing , and quite often when we take him in to appointments the nurses ca n't believe he actually has the condition he has			0
’ @entity7 ( pictured with his father , @entity46 ) had to undergo open heart surgery just hours after being born and surgeons warned he might not survive			1
he then suffered a heart attack and had to have two more operations @entity7 's mother , @entity21 , takes him swimming once a week and she believes that this has helped him to build up his strength			1
she says his doctors are amazed by how well he has done ms @entity21 and her partner @entity55 , 28 , were told 20 weeks into her pregnancy that her unborn son had hypoplastic left heart syndrome - a rare congenital heart defect where the left ventricle of the heart does not develop properly			1
they were asked to make a life - changing decision about whether or not to continue the pregnancy			0
they pledged to fight on for their little boy - even though he was given just a 50 per cent chance of survival			1
ms @entity21 was told 20 weeks into her pregnancy that @entity7 had hypoplastic left heart syndrome - a rare congenital heart defect where the left ventricle of the heart does not develop properly he had his first open - heart surgery operation at one - day - old , and recovered remarkably well			1
but hours before he was due to be discharged , @entity7 had a cardiac arrest in his mother 's arms and was rushed to intensive care			2
ms @entity21 , said : ‘ the doctors did n't think @entity7 would wake up after the cardiac arrest and he was moved to the high dependency unit for three weeks before we were allowed to bring him home			2
‘ he will always have half a heart , but he is just doing so well now			0
he 's 17 months now and he 's walking , talking , running around - and of course swimming			2
’ @entity84 left heart syndrome is a condition where the left side of the heart has not developed properly			1
the condition usually causes the left ventricle , which should pump oxygenated blood to the body , to be very small			1
it also often results in a blockage between the ventricle and the aorta - the artery which carries blood to the body - and in the aorta being much too small			2
many babies with the condition are diagnosed before birth			0
the condition is very hard to treat and the heart defect can not be corrected			2
surgery is sometimes carried out to allow the right side of the heart to take over the work of the left			2
however , this procedure is risky and requires three operations			0
occasionally , babies with the condition will be given a heart transplant			0
children with the syndrome sometimes experience breathlessness and often tire easily even after treatment .			0

@entity7 was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome
condition *prevents* the left ventricle of the heart from developing normally
he was given a 50 *%* chance of survival when he was born and had to have open heart surgery when he was just one - day - old
@entity7 then had a heart attack and had to have two more operations
but he is now thriving and his mother thinks his weekly swimming lessons have been the *key* to his *improvement*
