' 12:45 is a good kick - off time			1
i like it , ' @entity1 says			0
that is despite early saturday defeats last season to @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
four goals scored , 17 conceded			2
@entity6 will be hoping to replicate their 6 - 3 performance at the @entity11 , while @entity1 insists his game will be on their guard this time			1
but what is it about 12:45pm @entity17 kick - offs and @entity18 ? well , even before last season @entity18 promised to entertain , defy the odds and occasionally fall apart when kicking off early			1
four goals early on though , and the game was over			0
similarly at @entity8 , early strikes for the hosts plus a sending off to @entity33 put @entity18 out of the tie on @entity35			2
' would you rather kick off at three o’clock or 12:45 ? ' @entity1 asked on thursday			2
' it ’s two hours and 15 minutes			0
that does not produce a miracle in your physical recovery			0
' @entity18 were beaten 6 - 0 by @entity8 at @entity41 last season after a 12.45pm kick - off @entity8 players celebrate @entity45 's first half goal which gave the @entity46 an early 2 - 0 lead the 6 - 0 defeat by @entity8 was @entity1 's ( above ) 1,000th game in charge of the @entity23 2013/14 august 24 : @entity51 ( a ) won 3 - 1 october 26 : @entity52 ( a ) won 2 - 0 december 14 : @entity6 ( a ) lost 6 - 3 february 8 : @entity7 ( a ) lost 5 - 1 @entity53 march 8 : @entity54 ( h ) won 4 - 1 march 22 : @entity8 ( a ) lost 6 - 0 but @entity18 were noticeably unprepared for the early fixtures , and have been in the past , too			1
over the last three seasons @entity1 's side have won seven , drawn two and lost seven of their 12.45pm kick - off 's			1
not too bad a record when considering last season			0
32 goals scored and 38 conceded in these 16 fixtures tell you one thing , while the games themselves are surprising , almost random			1
beating @entity70 5 - 2 , drawing with relegation contenders @entity72 3 - 3 , beating @entity8 5 - 3 away from home but falling to @entity74 in a seven - goal thriller at @entity76			0
@entity77 put @entity6 ahead before a 6 - 3 win for @entity80 's side in december @entity6 put six past @entity18 shortly before @entity81 last season in one of the early kick - off defeats per @entity84 argues with @entity85 ( right ) after @entity18 's 6 - 3 defeat at the @entity11 the @entity23 have enjoyed some early kick - off success , beating @entity8 5 - 3 in 2011 @entity18 conceded 17 goals against their title rivals last season including five at @entity26 over the last three seasons , @entity18 have treated neutral fans to some high - scoring matches ... 2013/14 : l 6 - 0 @entity8 , l 5 - 1 @entity7 , l 6 - 3 @entity6 2012/13 : w 5 - 2 @entity70 2011/12 : @entity93 , @entity94 5 - 3 @entity8 , l 4 - 3 @entity74 the only notable high - scoring fixture @entity18 avoided in these early kick - offs was an 8 - 2 defeat to @entity98 ; luckily for the statistics that was on a sunday			1
@entity1 protests that the results last season were purely a coincidence , and more a combination of a great performance from the opposition and a poor @entity18 showing			2
after all , a 4 - 1 win against @entity54 in the @entity53 came at 12:45pm			0
@entity18 have the chance to right what was wrong last season against the league champions			0
they have already beaten @entity80 's side , albeit in the @entity113 , and are armed with the fire power to blow @entity6 away			2
but @entity1 must prepare his team better mentally , and perhaps more importantly physically to get the required result			0
either way , expect goals at the @entity119			0
@entity18 's summer signing @entity121 ( left ) takes time out during the training session @entity18 boss @entity1 is adamant the @entity23 will manage to perform in saturday 's early kick - off @entity18 players get physical in training before their tough encounter with @entity6 on saturday			1
