by @entity0 for @entity1 a student who has fulfilled her dream of a career in the army officer has also set up a successful fashion company , designing accessories made from upcycled surplus military apparel			2
and @entity9 , 24 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , now employs 35 veterans to stitch the high - fashion bags together and has recycled 15,000lbs of material - as well as serving as an intelligence officer			1
she got the idea to re-purpose excess materials while she was a senior at @entity19 in @entity20 two years ago , inspired by a talk by investor @entity22 about recycling - based businesses			2
they now run fashion firm @entity37 , while @entity9 works as a serving intelligence officer with the @entity39 in the 10th @entity40 ( @entity41 ) at @entity42 , @entity43			1

as an officer in the @entity53 your job is to lead soldiers and to motivate them to accomplish a task			0
' as the ceo , my job is to ensure that we 're accomplishing our social mission while keeping the team excited about what we 're doing , ' she tells @entity71 's digital series @entity70 , which profiles the lives of military veterans who are doing unique things in the civilian world			1

and sister @entity27 had every faith in her ideas			0
' when she first told me about her idea i was so surprised and happy that she shared that with me , ' says @entity27			0

from that conversation the sisters continue to build on the idea and business model			0
@entity9 also works as a serving intelligence officer at @entity42 , @entity43 for @entity9 and @entity107 - a biblical phrase to ' turn swords into ploughshares ' - means re-adapting military technology for a peaceful civilian purpose			2
