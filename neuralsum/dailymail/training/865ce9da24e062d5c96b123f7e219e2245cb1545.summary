by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:44 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:44 est , 23 december 2013 @entity3 is promoting the christian values of @entity5 in his sermon , praising those who help their communities @entity3 will today issue a highly religious @entity5 message in a bid to rescue his @entity12 concept			1
the prime minister praises those who help out in their communities for putting ‘ their faith into action ’ , saying : ‘ it is more blessed to give than to receive ’			2
mr @entity3 once likened his @entity20 faith to the reception of @entity22 in the @entity23 , admitting that ‘ it comes and goes ’			1
but he is keen to reaffirm his @entity25 in his message today , showing that he is more than happy to ‘ do @entity27 ’			1
‘ for me , this season is a time to think about the meaning of @entity5 – the birth of @entity31 and the hope that gives to millions , ’ he says			0
‘ in @entity35 , these words from the @entity34 are brilliantly put to music : “ his name shall be called @entity38 , @entity39 , the mighty @entity27 , the everlasting father , the @entity31 ”			0
’ mr @entity3 also invokes scripture in a bid to revive the @entity12 , his concept that charities and other groups should step in to help at times of austerity , which failed to win over voters at the election			1
the idea has been periodically revived but many @entity51 mps believe that the prime minister ’s failure to explain it properly to voters helped to cost him a majority in 2010			0
‘ there are those millions who keep on strengthening our society too – being good neighbours , running clubs and voluntary associations , playing their part in countless small ways to help build what i call the “ big society ” , ’ he says			0
‘ many of these people are @entity70 who live out to the letter that verse in acts , that “ it is more blessed to give than to receive ”			0
these people put their faith into action and we can all be grateful for what they do			0
’ mr @entity3 also uses his message to reflect on the past year , claiming that the country has pulled together in tough times			1
the remarks will also be seen as an attempt to revive the @entity12 concept he says : ‘ looking back , 2013 has been a year when our country pulled together to overcome the challenges we face			1
‘ together we have made real progress on strengthening our economy and creating more decent jobs so that people can provide for their families			0
‘ this progress is down to the efforts of millions who go out and work hard every day , putting in the hours , running businesses and keeping our economy going			0
’ mr @entity3 welcomes the arrival of @entity97 as the new archbishop of @entity99 and @entity100			2
‘ both have come in with exciting plans to rejuvenate their respective churches , which should inspire @entity70 around the world , ’ he says			0
the prime minister also praises the ‘ brave service women and men who are helping bring peace here and around the world ’ and those in ‘ the emergency and caring services who are working hard to support those in need this @entity5 ’			2
more than @entity25 : @entity116 ( left ) and @entity117 ( right ) , who both do n't believe in @entity27 , stress the importance of spending time with family in their @entity5 messages in messages delivered by other party leaders , deputy prime minister @entity117 , an avowed atheist , insists that @entity5 is about more than @entity25			1
it is , of course , one of the biggest events in the @entity25 calendar – a time for hope , kindness , family , and goodwill , ’ he says on video			1
‘ for @entity70 it is a celebration of the birth of @entity31 as a gift from @entity27 and someone who embodied the values of love and forgiveness to which we should all aspire			2
but what is so extraordinary about this time of year is that it brings together the whole country – religious , non-religious , @entity25 , @entity147 – to embrace these values and celebrate together			1
’ labour leader @entity116 , who was raised in a @entity150 family but is not a believer in @entity27 , made clear that his @entity5 break would not have religious connotations			1
‘ @entity5 is a special time of the year for many people , ’ he says			0
‘ lots of us take a break from the everyday pressures of work to spend time together with friends and family , strengthening the relationships that mean so much to us			2
‘ i would like to pay particular tribute to the many people , churches and charities who will be looking after those who are alone or homeless this @entity5 time			0
‘ we should also pay tribute to those who will be working so that the rest of us have an enjoyable break , especially our medical staff , our police and our @entity174 , thank you for your service			0
’ mr @entity3 ’s @entity25 message comes after shadow foreign secretary @entity179 suggested public figures have allowed ‘ political correctness ’ to prevent them talking about faith and the persecution of @entity184 , and prince @entity186 warned that @entity25 was beginning to ‘ disappear ’ from its own birthplace , as @entity188 ‘ deliberately target ’ communities .			1

@entity3 has stressed @entity25 values of helping others in speech
comments seen as a revival of the @entity12 message delivered at election
@entity116 and @entity117 - both atheists - stressed importance of family
