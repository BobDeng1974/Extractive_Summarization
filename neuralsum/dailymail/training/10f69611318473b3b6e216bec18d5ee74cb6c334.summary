by @entity0 published : 03:53 est , 2 november 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 4 november 2013 new theory : @entity3 , a former @entity4 employee , may have stolen @entity5 in revenge for losing his job after stealing money to fund a drug habit , reports claim the key suspect being investigated over @entity12 's disappearance who died in a freak tractor accident was a heroin addict who robbed apartments to fund his habit , it has been claimed			1
@entity3 was fired from his job in the restaurant at the @entity20 's club in @entity21 a year before the @entity22 's came to stay in may 2007			1
but reports claim he was caught stealing from the tills and raiding the resort 's rooms for valuables to sell in exchange for drugs			0
an investigation is now under way to determine whether @entity3 , who was run over by a tractor at the age of 40 in 2009 , took @entity34 in revenge for losing his job			1
close friend @entity36 , 44 , a builder from @entity38 , told the @entity39 : ' @entity40 was a good guy but he had some serious drug problems			0
he would smoke heroin and become a slave to it			0
' i know he would sometimes break into apartments and rob them			0
he was taking valuables from rooms at @entity50 and selling them for drugs			2
' police identified him as their main suspect after mobile phone records indicated he was around the @entity55 ’ holiday apartment in @entity21 when @entity34 disappeared on may 3 2007 the flat is a 15 - minute drive from the town of @entity38 where he was living after he stopped working at the @entity50			1
yesterday , it emerged @entity3 , from @entity62 in @entity63 , was convicted of theft in 1996 but escaped deportation after a presidential pardon			1
however , his family deny the allegation			0
motive : police are investigating whether @entity3 , who died in 2009 in a tractor accident , killed @entity5 prime suspect : e-fits of the man seen carrying a child 500 yards from the @entity55 ' holiday apartment @entity3 's widow @entity77 , who has been questioned by police , told local media : ‘ they are looking for a suspect that ca n't defend himself			1
‘ @entity84 ' lives ca n't be exposed this way			0
’ a source told @entity88 newspaper @entity87 that police believe he may have killed the youngster to ‘ shut her up ’ when he saw the huge media response to the disappearance - and are now trying to find her body			1
@entity88 ’s attorney - general gave the go - ahead for the investigation into the girl ’s disappearance to be reopened last week at the request of local police – more than five years after the original inquiry was shelved			2
@entity87 claimed : ‘ police suspicions about the former @entity50 employee arose during the review of the case carried out by a @entity108 team from @entity109			1
‘ this was the strongest new lead presented to state prosecutors which led to the investigation being reopened			0
‘ the man , who died aged 40 in a tractor accident in 2009 , was not on the list of employees handed over to police during the initial investigation by the @entity50 because at the time of @entity5 ’s disappearance he was not working there			1
’ it described his departure from the @entity50 as ‘ frictious ’ and said : ‘ the motives that could have caused the ex-employee to kidnap the youngster are still being investigated			2
’ hope : the @entity22 's lawyer said that the couple , seen here with a computer generated image of how @entity5 might have looked in 2012 , are still motivated by the belief that she is still alive it suggests that he may ‘ have committed the kidnap as a form of retaliation against the @entity50			1
his aim could have been to call into question the security of the holiday club but something went wrong and the youngster disappeared			0
’ @entity88 police and a spokesman for the @entity55 declined to comment on the newspaper report yesterday			1
it emerged over the weekend that police were planning to reinterview several @entity50 employees			2

@entity88 police are thought to have returned to the @entity21 area about a month ago to carry out mobile phone tracking work			1
last week it emerged that @entity162 and @entity22 are to apply under @entity88 law to become private ‘ prosecutors ’ and may now be able to influence the course of the investigation and any prosecution			2
their status as ‘ assistentes ’ will allow their legal team to work alongside state prosecutors , keeping the @entity55 informed of all new developments in the case			0
they could also bring a parallel private prosecution against any suspects charged over @entity34 ’s disappearance			0
a secrecy order put on the case by @entity88 ’s attorney general could also be lifted just for them , giving access to all case files			0
