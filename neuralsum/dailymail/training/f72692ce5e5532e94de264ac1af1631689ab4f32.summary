if you ’ve ever sent a text to the wrong person , or regretted texting someone while drunk , then the @entity1 app could offer some piece of mind			1
it works in a similar way to @entity10 , by automatically deleting messages , photos and videos seconds after they ’ve been viewed			1
however , unlike @entity10 , @entity1 lets you also delete messages remotely , from another person ’s device , before they get a chance to read it			1
it lets people send self - destructing messages , photos and videos when using the ‘ off the record ’ mode			1
users can see when people have read their messages and if a text is sent by mistake , it can be deleted from the other user ’s device the free @entity1 app is available on @entity39 and @entity40 and was created by 23 - year - old @entity21 from @entity22			1
‘ @entity1 is the safest place to let go , and be yourself with friends , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ it ’s the only messaging app that lets you communicate like you do in person , without leaving a record behind			0
‘ with @entity1 you can go ‘ off the record ’ , and have full conversations that automatically disappear ; send self - destructing photos and videos that only last for seconds ; and take back the messages you already shared using synced deletion			1
’ videos and photos only appear when a user clicks ‘ tap to view ’ , and once viewed it is visible for 60 seconds before being deleted			1
however , people do n’t have to use the ‘ off the record ’ function , and can use @entity1 to save conversations in a similar way to other messaging apps such as @entity64 or @entity65 @entity1 ( pictured left ) is the latest in a line of @entity10 rivals , which include @entity69 's @entity68 ( pictured centre ) and @entity71 ( pictured right ) only users of the app can message each other in ' off the record ' mode			2
the self - destruct feature does not apply to messages , photos or videos sent using traditional methods or through other apps			2
videos and photos only appear when a user clicks ‘ tap to view ’ , and once viewed are only be visible for 60 seconds before being deleted from both users ’ phones			1
photos and videos can also be annotated , and captions can be added			0
however , people do n’t have to use the ‘ off the record ’ function , and can use @entity1 to save conversations in a similar way to other messaging apps such as @entity64 or @entity95 by not enabling this tool			2

this directly followed once - popular social network @entity108 ’s attempts to get back into the game with @entity110 , their own video messaging service			0
