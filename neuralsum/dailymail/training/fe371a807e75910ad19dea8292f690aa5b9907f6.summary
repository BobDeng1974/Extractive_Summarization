local resident @entity91 , 38 , said : ' she got compensation following an accident and was in a coma for about a year			0
' they bought the house outright and moved up here from @entity98 which is a more downmarket area			0
' it was a bit of a shock when it all happened			0
' they seemed to have a lot of support from family members who were always coming and going			0
' but there were also coppers everywhere so we knew something was wrong			0
' they told all of us it was cot death which seemed a bit suspicious because he was too old			2
' i asked her a couple of months ago if she 'd had the funeral yet but she said they were still waiting for toxicology results			0
crime scene : @entity7 consumed the drugs in the £ 200,000 home in @entity43 he lived in with his mother and father ( pictured ) until he died in may 2012 ' i knew they smoked weed because you could constantly smell it coming from the house			1

shame : @entity7 lived in a home strewn with drug paraphernalia , which the parents tried to hide from the authorities ' @entity7 was ever such a sweet little boy , he called himself ' @entity143 ' because he always wore a t - shirt with the red and yellow 's ' on it			1

' away from the areas where people may visit , the main bedroom was untidy and strewn with drug paraphernalia and this is the room in which the family slept			0
' it seems that during his short life , @entity7 became accustomed to living amongst these items and , tragically , consumed a quantity of heroin that ultimately led to his death			1
' we do n't know exactly how the youngster came to ingest the illegal drug - but we do know that he should never have been exposed to them in any case			0
' those who should have been caring him for him ultimately caused his untimely and tragic death			0
