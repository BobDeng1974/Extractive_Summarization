the @entity0 will push the equivalent of 2.3 million full - time workers out of the @entity4 labor force by the year 2021 , according to a stunning report from the nonpartisan @entity6 on tuesday			1
the office 's latest estimates threaten to puncture the @entity11 administration 's argument that @entity0 wo n't be a long - term job killer , since incentives built into the health care law appear to be discouraging taxpayers from working			1
' @entity6 estimates that the @entity0 will reduce the total number of hours worked , on net , by about 1.5 to 2 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024 , ' the @entity6 reported			2
not just computer trouble : @entity11 , taking a picture of a student today , dispute the cb report on the effects of @entity0 on the job market released today this , the office 's analysts determined , will be ' almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor – given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive			1
' in 2001 the @entity6 estimated that the economy would lose the equivalent of 800,000 full - time jobs as the @entity0 was implemented			1
the new numbers for 2021 represent a near - tripling of that estimate			0
' the reduction in @entity6 's projections of hours worked represents a decline in the number of full - time - equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017 , rising to about 2.5 million in 2024 , ' the @entity6 report said			2
@entity45 @entity44 sen. @entity44 lashed out at the @entity46 after the @entity6 report was made public late on tuesday morning			1
' so in addition to people getting canceled policies or sticker shock and finding out that their health care costs did n’t go down , they went up , or finding that if you like your doctor , you ca n’t keep them , ' @entity44 said on the @entity58 floor , ' what we ’re finding is that these same people may find themselves out of work as a result of the policies of the @entity0			1
' ' the @entity6 looked primarily at how employers would respond to a new penalty for failing to offer insurance to employees that work more than 30 hours , ' he said			0
' that response would include cutting people ’s hours , hiring fewer workers and lowering wages for new jobs			2
' blow : the report said jittery employers would choose to hire fewer people ¿ a focus that a @entity46 official told reporters was ' incomplete , ' ' overwrought ' and ' misinterpreted			2
it is another woe for @entity11 after the botched roll out of the internet sign up , above early reporting on the congressional bean - counters ' pronouncement focused on job losses expected because jittery employers would choose to hire fewer people – a focus that a @entity46 official told reporters was ' incomplete , ' ' overwrought ' and ' misinterpreted			1
' he said during a hastily assembled conference call tuesday afternoon that the @entity6 report found that ' overall there 's very little impact on labor demand ' from @entity0			0
a @entity46 statement issued a half - hour earlier had insisted that ' @entity6 's findings are not driven by an assumption that @entity0 will lead employers to eliminate jobs or reduce hours , in fact , the report itself says that there is ' no compelling evidence that part - time employment has increased as a result of the @entity0			1
' the official on the conference call emphasized that workers are exercising ' voluntary choices ' brought on by ' a new set of options , ' including the chance to retire earlier than they may have planned			0
he compared the shift of full - time to part - time labor to a hypothetical situation in which the federal government stopped paying social security benefits			0
' i do n't think there 's any debate that if you got rid of @entity128 and @entity129 , more 95 - year - olds would work , ' the senior official said			0
pressed to explain how increased unemployment could be seen as a net benefit of @entity0 , the official emphasized the availability of ' new choices and new options that will – ' adding after an awkward pause , ' lead to different choices			2
' critic : @entity45 @entity44 sen. @entity44 lashed out at the added hardship forced on normal people who are already ' getting canceled policies or sticker shock and finding out that their health care costs didn ¿ t go down ' @entity46 press secretary @entity145 also spun the news as a positive for workers who may ' no longer be trapped in a job just to provide coverage for their families , and would have the opportunity to pursue their dreams			1
' ' over the longer run , ' he said , ' @entity6 finds that because of this law , individuals will be empowered to make choices about their own lives and livelihoods , like retiring on time rather than working into their elderly years or choosing to spend more time with their families			0
' @entity163 , a conservative pressure group , was unimpressed			0
' @entity166 is hurting @entity4 by leading to cancelled plans , lost coverage , and rising costs , ' the group 's president , @entity164 , said tuesday in a statement , ' but it 's also proving to be detrimental to economic growth , just as many of us predicted			0
' ' the @entity6 's numbers speak for themselves , ' he said			0
' the reality is , big government programs like @entity0 do not and can not create lasting prosperity or opportunity for anyone			1

@entity181 says @entity0 will pull the equivalent of 2.3 million jobs out of the economy by 2021
@entity46 insists it ’s a good thing *consumers* have ' choices ' and says the job losses wo n’t come from employers hiring less
@entity45 senator *slams* @entity11 administration for *heaping* more unemployment on @entity4 already suffering from ' sticker shock '
conservatives say the new forecast is evidence that the @entity0 ca n’t ' create lasting prosperity or opportunity for anyone '
