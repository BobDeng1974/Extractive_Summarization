should the day ever come when the dead do rise from their graves a new disaster preparedness kit could give you an edge in those chaotic first hours for the reasonable cost of $ 1,499			2
called the @entity7 24 , the 12 '' by 9 '' waterproof and dust tight kit includes a revolver , flashlight , emergency signals , fire starter , compass , 550 para cord , batteries , and a battery caddy			2
to ensure that all of this stays in good condition while on the run from the ravenous hordes , the case is also resistant to uv , solvents , corrosion and fungus			2
' the revolver , dubbed the ' @entity53 ' by the company , a three inch barrel gun that can take both 45 @entity57 ammo for long distances and .410 2 - 1/2 '' shotshells for close - range targets			0
buyers can customize it with fiber optic front sights , fixed rear sights , and a rubber grip			0
as for the knife , it is a fixed blade tactical knife with two edges made of what the company calls a ' nearly indestructible form ' of carbon steel			0
and with power grids likely failing along with the rest of society , it 's a good thing that the case include a @entity78 flashlight , the same model that won the @entity80 's @entity82 award			0
assuming you get into a situation where rescue might be possible , there are also plenty of emergency signals			0
the @entity44 company notes that being prepared can make the difference between life or death in the first hours of a national disaster the entire kit is built to be waterproof and withstand shocks so it stays together on the run through chaos the kit 's @entity98 , also from @entity100 , can be seen for up to a mile and can be set to fast strobe , slow strobe , and steady			0
the lights are also waterproof , dustrproof , and shockproof just like the case			0
for absolute basic survival needs a good fire starter is a must , and @entity44 covers that with a @entity109 from @entity110 that contains a flint wheel ignition to light up water - resistant @entity112			0
a 550 @entity114 cord , the same kind of nylon rope used in @entity118 parachute suspension lines , rounds out the kit and could have multiple applications			0
while these items will no doubt be helpful anywhere , a new study suggests you 'd be best off having them in the hills			0
researchers from @entity129 @entity128 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 used an approach for modelling disease to work out how an actual outbreak might play out			1
new research suggests the kit might be most effective if you 're already safely hidden in the mountains ' modeling zombies takes you through a lot of the techniques used to model real diseases , albeit in a fun context , ' said researcher @entity128 they found that cities would fall quickly , but it would take weeks for zombies to penetrate into less densely populated areas , and months to reach northern parts of the mountain - time zone			1
their advice is to head for the @entity154			1
the research involved results from simulations the researchers wrote themselves , similar to modelling chemical reactions			1
also in the kit is an emergency light , compass , fire starter , and knife ' modeling zombies takes you through a lot of the techniques used to model real diseases , albeit in a fun context , ' @entity128 told phys.org			1
there are four states a person can be in ( human , infected , zombie , dead zombie ) , and these are dependent on possible interactions ( zombie bites human , human kills zombie , zombie moves etc )			1
' given the dynamics of the disease , once the zombies invade more sparsely populated areas , the whole outbreak slows down - there are fewer humans to bite , so you start creating zombies at a slower rate , ' says @entity128			1
' i 'd love to see a fictional account where most of @entity192 falls in a day , but upstate @entity192 has a month or so to prepare			0
' the researchers aim to add more complicated social variables to their simulation such as awareness of the outbreak and ability to make a run for it			1
the group were inspired by graduate statistical mechanics class and by reading ' @entity203 : an oral history of the first zombie war ' by @entity206			2
characters on ' @entity208 ' have tried several different hide outs from the zombie apocalypse , including a remote farm and a prison , but researchers at @entity129 think they have found the ideal place to go @entity215 has had @entity217 survivors taking refuges in a shopping mall in ' @entity220 ' ( left ) , while @entity221 choose to head to their local pub in ' @entity223 ' ( right ) indeed the conclusions of their research match up with some of the plot points of the book , which sees the @entity217 abandon two - thirds of the country and retreat behind the @entity154 to regroup before launching a counterattack			1
the @entity129 team are less optimistic about our prospects			1
the abstract for their research ends with the line : ' we build up to a full scale simulation of an outbreak in the @entity217 , and discover that for " realistic " parameters , we are largely doomed			1
' despite this , since 2011 the @entity241 has playfully used a zombie apocalypse as a learning tool for teaching emergency preparedness			2
the group presents its findings during the 2015 @entity248 , on thursday , march 5 in @entity249 , @entity250 .			0

researchers from @entity129 created a simulation of a zombie outbreak using techniques for modelling real diseases
they found that cities would fall quickly , but less densely populated areas could hold out for months
with fewer humans to bite you , rural areas create zombies at a much slower rate
their advice is to head to the @entity270
however they conclude that using realistic parameters in their simulation ' we are largely doomed '
