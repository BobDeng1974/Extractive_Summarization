by @entity0 published : 06:30 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 09:55 est , 15 january 2014 a woman of ‘ very limited means ’ has launched a legal battle for the right to ‘ harvest ’ her seriously - ill partner ’s sperm so that she can have his children , it was revealed today			1
the action at @entity14 ’s @entity13 is being seen as a potentially important test case , involving a man kept alive medically after a devastating series of heart attacks who could die at any time			1
the woman - known as ‘ @entity22 ’ - says her partner - a wealthy retired investment banker who is being called ‘ p ’ - would have given his written consent had he known ‘ he would be in his current state ’			1
landmark : the action at @entity14 's @entity13 ( pictured ) is being seen as a potentially important test case , involving a man kept alive medically after a devastating series of heart attacks who could die at any time her lawyers say she is @entity35 ’s common law wife and they have been together for several years and had extensive talks about raising a family			1
@entity35 proposed marriage with a ring last year , and she accepted			0
@entity22 is challenging a decision of the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) preventing her partner ’s sperm being retrieved from him and stored for future use , possibly abroad			2
high court judge @entity46 discharged a court order @entity22 obtained in an emergency telephone application made to another judge on christmas eve allowing a hospital to carry out a harvesting operation pending the outcome of her judicial review application against the @entity41 , the @entity56 regulator that monitors the use and storage of human eggs , sperm or embryos			2
her legal challenge is due to be heard over two days next month			0
@entity22 ’s lawyers had argued the order was urgently needed because @entity35 was subject to a ‘ do not resuscitate ’ ( @entity66 ) order and might die before the hearing , but mrs @entity46 ruled this week the order was legally flawed and should never have been made			1
important case : the woman of ' very limited means ' has launched a legal battle for the right to ' harvest ' her seriously - ill partner 's sperm so that she can have his children ( file picture ) the judge also directed that the @entity13 judge who hears @entity22 ’s legal challenge should sit at the start of the hearing as a judge of the @entity85 - a court set up to safeguard vulnerable people - to consider ‘ what is in @entity35 ’s best interests ’ before going on to hear @entity22 ’s arguments against the @entity41			1
@entity22 ’s lawyers told mrs @entity46 that @entity35 suffered his first cardiac arrest and was taken to intensive care in early december			0
a @entity56 widow made legal history last august by using her dead husband 's sperm to try to conceive a child - even though it is still illegal			0
the businesswoman , who is in her early 40s , had his sperm extracted without his consent in an ' act of desperation ' while he was in a coma and close to death with a heart condition			1
it is against @entity56 law to take , store , transport and use in @entity110 a man 's sperm without his written consent			1
the woman has since his death undergone fertility treatment abroad			2
she obtained an emergency ruling by a judge to have her husband 's sperm extracted because he was so close to death			0
the judge agreed to the procedure being carried out to allow her time to find proof of his consent			1
despite this never being produced , she was later permitted to take the sperm to another country to begin @entity110 treatment			0
the case was the first time a @entity56 woman went ahead with such treatment without a court hearing			1
the @entity41 did not oppose her bid , meaning the regulatory body effectively supported her and her doctors in breaking the law			0
@entity140 and @entity141 are among a handful of @entity144 countries where it is legal to use a man 's sperm without his consent in @entity110 treatment			1
this case was different to @entity22 and @entity35 in that the @entity41 was not asked to give permission before the retrieval of the sperm took place			2
her case follows that of @entity157 , whose husband fell into a coma after developing bacterial meningitis in 1995 and later died			2
doctors extracted @entity163 's sperm while he was unconscious			0
the @entity41 instructed @entity56 fertility clinics not to treat mrs blood , from @entity167 , @entity168			0
however , after a two - year legal battle , the @entity169 ruled that it was her human right to travel to a different country to have ivf using mr @entity163 ’s sperm			0
but it also ruled that this was only because of the unique circumstances of the case and it must not set a precedent			2
by @entity181 he had suffered four heart attacks and the @entity66 order had been issued			1
@entity22 said she had been advised he was in a ‘ permanent vegetative state ’ and could die at any moment			1
the @entity41 told @entity22 ’s lawyers that there was no power to issue a special licence to allow the hospital caring for p to retrieve and store his sperm because of provisions of the 1990 @entity41 ( @entity196 ) @entity195 requiring @entity35 ’s consent			2
the @entity41 also said @entity35 ’s hospital was not licensed to store gametes - the reproductive cells in sperm - and they should not be harvested ‘ in circumstances where they can not lawfully be stored ’			0
lawyers for @entity22 are accusing the @entity41 of misapplying the law when it decided it did not have power to grant a special licence for storage			0
the latest medical update , received by the @entity13 this week stated that @entity35 ’s condition had stabilised and the @entity66 notice had been lifted			2
but it remained grave , and he relied on a tracheotomy for air and a nasogastric tube for feeding			0
the judge refused to make a protective costs order in favour of @entity22 to limit the amount she will be exposed to if she loses her legal challenge			2
her counsel @entity221 said she was ‘ a person of very limited means ’ - and her case raised important legal questions			1
mr @entity221 said : ‘ there is clearly a public interest in having this issue settled once and for all			0
she ( @entity22 ) wants to obtain a decision she genuinely and sincerely believes her partner would want			0
’ rejecting the application , the judge said the case did raise a question of general public importance , but the information provided to the court about @entity22 ’s assets and means was ‘ wholly inadequate ’ to justify a protective costs order			1
she said : ‘ at least at some time @entity35 has been a wealthy man , having made a great deal of money from investment banking before retiring			1
’ a @entity41 spokesman told @entity246 today : ' the @entity41 has every sympathy with this couple and the difficult situation they find themselves in			0
' however , the law on consent to storage and use of sperm is clear : the @entity41 has no discretion to grant special permission for sperm to be stored without the person ’s consent			0
' we have carefully considered this case , in which the @entity41 has , for the first time , been asked to give permission to retrieve and store sperm from someone in a coma who has not given the consent required by the law governing @entity110			1
' we will continue to be responsive to the court and the claimant and take every step to ensure the case can be rapidly resolved			0

@entity13 action being seen as potentially important test case
man being kept alive medically after heart attacks and could die any time
woman is ' of very limited means ' and partner is ' wealthy retired banker '
she says he *'d* have given written consent had he known of current state
man was issued with a ' do not resuscitate ' order after four heart attacks
