raffles , cake sales , coffee mornings … all would have gone down a treat and made a tidy sum			2
but the women of one village were set on doing something rather more risque to raise funds for their crumbling community hall – volunteering to strip for a charity calendar			1
and they became even more determined when some members of the village hall committee unkindly suggested they might have more success if they kept their clothes on			1
naked ambition : the @entity17 were set on doing some rather more risque than cake sales and raffles to raise money for the community hall some feared the calendar would damage the reputations of villagers in positions of responsibility , while others argued the idea was a little tired , after the success of @entity31 starring @entity32 , the hit movie based on the antics of the @entity35 in @entity36			1
but for those brave enough to flick through the pages , the calendar starring the ladies of @entity17 in the @entity39 is perhaps more daring than the original , in which strategic positioning of cakes helped protect the modesty of the models			1
the @entity17 girls are made of sterner stuff			1
in one shot ten ladies pose naked on hay bales – with the farmer ’s permission , of course			2
in another a local beautician , the parish council clerk and a sales rep run hand - in - hand – bottoms bared – across a cornfield			2
@entity17 organiser @entity60 , 45 , said : ‘ the original @entity31 calendar is lovely , but they are hiding behind their buns			1
we are in for a penny , in for a pound and it is all out there			2
it is more @entity71 than @entity36 in that respect			2
’ after miss @entity60 ’s idea was rejected at the hall ’s committee meeting , she decided to take matters into her own hands			1
‘ it made me quite annoyed , ’ she recalled			2
‘ i was so determined , i literally went out that night and knocked on people ’s doors to ask them if they were willing to do it			0
daring : the group of women from @entity84 , @entity85 , who are attempting to raise funds by appearing in the calendar ‘ i was amazed how many people said “ yes ” , even though we did n’t know each other			1
’ soon well - wishers – many of them men – were pouring money into the project to cover publishing costs , and local photographer @entity95 offered her services for free			0
all were keen to save the 100 - year - old hall , built through steelworker subscriptions , which is the centre of the community , hosting everything from bingo to dance classes			0
the @entity17 girls include parish council clerk @entity105 , 27 , who is seen tending her plants in the buff			1
pensioner @entity108 , 76 , known locally for her bra - fitting skills , was the oldest of the group to undress			0
she said : ‘ my wedding reception was held in the village hall , so i knew i had to do something			0
first of all , i thought it was just sponsoring them , then they asked me to take my clothes off			0
i am naked when i go to bed each night anyway , so i thought , “ why not ? ” ’ film : the @entity17 calendar is perhaps more daring than the original , which inspired the 2003 film starring @entity122 ( left ) , as @entity123 , @entity32 ( centre ) , as @entity125 , and @entity126 ( right ) as @entity127 now even the women ’s critics are starting to come round to the calendar , which costs £ 10			1
@entity131 , 42 , a committee member , explained her initial opposition			0
‘ even if the calendar pictures are classy , there will still be a minority who wo n’t approve , ’ she said			1
‘ we did n’t want to offend anybody			0
as a committee , we decided we did n’t want to commit to funding it ourselves			0
’ @entity141 , 70 , chairman of the committee , said : ‘ there were a few members who were rather circumspect			0
there were concerns it had been done before and would n’t work			0
‘ but having seen how the whole community has got into the idea , we are delighted to have their help			1
it ’s certainly a talking point in the village			0

women of @entity17 , @entity39 , have stripped for a charity calendar
some feared damage to reputation of those in positions of responsibility
others argued idea was tired after success of the film calendar girls
but the @entity17 calendar is perhaps more daring than the original
