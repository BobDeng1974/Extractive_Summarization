' he then escalated what was already very serious offending to a new level by a prolonged and terrifying sexual assault on a female burglary victim alone in her dwelling			0
' it was for financial gain to live a glamorous lifestyle well beyond what he was able to afford			0
' the sexual assault was gratuitous , probably unplanned , but nevertheless devastating for the victim concerned			0
' for @entity4 , defence counsel @entity112 said the teenager had suffered a ' feeling of rejection ' after discovering , when he was 13 , that he was adopted			2
she said : ' the reason why he wanted to make money was in order for him to pay off a drug debt '			0
