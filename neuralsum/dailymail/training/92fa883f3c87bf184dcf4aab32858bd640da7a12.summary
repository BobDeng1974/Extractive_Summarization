when @entity2 , 21 , from the @entity4 district of central @entity5 , fell in love with a local boy , her family was delighted - even more so when he asked her to marry him			1
but less than two months after the marriage , @entity2 , now 22 , found herself in hospital doubled up in pain			2
the reason ? her husband @entity12 , incensed by her family 's inability to pay a dowry , had tricked her into drinking a glass of acid in a bid to murder her and clear the way to marriage with someone else			1
tragically , @entity2 is by no means alone			0
at @entity25 in @entity26 , a specialist burns unit funded by the @entity28 , the wards are packed with men , women and children who have fallen prey to acid attacks			1
a year on from the attack , she is still in hospital agony : @entity40 , 47 , was attacked by a cousin during a land dispute while @entity43 , 29 ( right ) , also found herself the victim of a relative 's attack globally , the majority of acid attacks occur in @entity49 , @entity5 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , although the numbers of @entity56 victims are increasing and include , most famously , model - turned - presenter @entity57			1
the reasons are legion , with many occurring between husbands and wives although others happen because of rejection , as a way of removing a business rival or even as revenge for a relationship gone wrong			0
one man who knows all too well the implications of what can happen when a business deal goes wrong is muezzin @entity40 , 47 , who was left scarred for life after a cousin threw acid in his face during a dispute over land			1
others , such as @entity79 , 14 , were caught in the crossfire when someone close to them was attacked			1
the teenager , who comes from the city of @entity84 in @entity5 , was splashed with acid as he slept next to his mother - the intended target - one night			2
innocent victim : @entity79 , 14 , was hurt in an attack on his mother by neighbours angry that she refused to have an affair with them while his father was away @entity95 plans : despite the injuries inflicted on @entity98 by her husband , the 22 - year - old is currently studying for a degree in finance horrific : @entity102 , 27 , was attacked by a cousin during a family row while @entity105 , 45 , was hurt by the husband of a woman he had an affair with now @entity79 , @entity2 and @entity40 's stories have been brought together in a heartbreaking collection of photographs by @entity114 - based @entity113 photographer , @entity112 , 35			1
' @entity2 was one of the hardest to photograph , ' he reveals			0
' she was really crying before we did the interview and pictures			0
' and for good reason : since the attack , @entity2 's badly burned mouth , digestive tract , stomach and trachea have left her unable to eat without pain			1
' it was pretty shocking to see so many victims of acid attacks , ' adds mr @entity112 , ' but apart from that , doing the shoot was n't difficult			2
all the survivors were very friendly and helpful			0
when you start working , you get so focused on getting the right pictures that you almost forget how bad some of the victims look			2
' particularly badly hurt was @entity135 , now 22 , who was 15 when she had acid thrown into her face and upper body by her husband , @entity139 , a man 20 years older than she is			2
like so many victims , @entity142 's injuries came about following a series of violent rows with her husband - rows that left her so traumatised , her parents had threatened to take her away from her husband			2
shocking : student @entity148 , 24 , was attacked by her fiance and father 's employer @entity152 following a dispute between the two men appalling : @entity155 , 43 , was attacked by a neighbour rejected by her sister while @entity158 , 43 , was left blind after refusing to have an affair dispute : @entity161 , a 58 - year - old farmer , was attacked by a neighbour with industrial acid following a wrangle over a stolen bicycle sadly , they were n't in time to stop the attack which left @entity142 badly scarred and forced to give up her dreams of becoming a dancer			1
nevertheless , @entity142 , who is currently studying for a degree in finance , has big plans for the future - much to delight of @entity112			2
' i really respect those people , ' he adds			0
' some of them are very badly hurt and yet , they are still fighting to live as normal a life as possible which must be incredibly difficult following such a devastating attack			0
' entitled survivors , the project includes photos of 18 acid attack victims - all of whom come from @entity5 , although the problem extends far beyond the south @entity189 country 's borders			1
this is something mr @entity112 hopes to highlight			0
' not enough is being done to help these people , although things are getting better , ' he says			0
' the reason i wanted to do the project was to draw attention to the issue and make people aware that it 's still going on			0
' hopefully , that will mean fewer people will become victims in future			0
the @entity204 has done a lot to help people in @entity5 but much more could still be done			0
' for more on survivors , see kenhermann.dk			0
@entity2 , @entity142 , @entity40 and @entity79 just some of the victims helped by the @entity28			1
for more on their work , see @entity212 rejected : @entity213 , 30 , was attacked after she turned down the offer of an affair with her neighbour - a story that is regularly repeated among acid attack victims painful : male acid attack victim @entity219 , 48 , a day labourer , was left disfigured after a row with a neighbour turned deadly hurt : @entity223 , 25 , paid the price for her family 's dispute with a neighbour while @entity228 , 30 , mother of 14 - year - old @entity79 , was attacked after refusing an affair			1
