@entity1 manager @entity0 believes his rejuvenated squad could yet hunt down @entity3 and @entity4 in the @entity6 title race to emulate the class of 1997/1998			1
the @entity8 - who earlier this week completed the signing of @entity12 defender @entity11 from @entity14 - host out - of - form @entity13 on sunday looking to record a fifth win in the last six league matches which would see them move back within striking distance of the top four			1
with @entity3 and @entity4 drawing 1 - 1 at @entity21 in saturday 's late kick - off , the @entity8 are now 14 points off the pace			1
@entity25 scored in @entity1 's last game against @entity13 , a 3 - 0 win in september @entity28 shone in @entity1 's 3 - 2 win against @entity30 and will look repeat his display on sunday @entity32 inspired @entity1 to an important three points over @entity4 two weeks ago it is a similar scenario to that faced in the 1997/98 campaign , @entity0 's first full season in charge			1
@entity1 trailed @entity39 by some 12 points at the end of february before embarking on a nine - match winning streak which saw them go on to lift a first title in seven years and then complete the double with victory over @entity48 in the @entity50 final at @entity51			1
given the likes of @entity53 and @entity25 , who both scored in the @entity50 fourth - round win at @entity30 , are fighting fight , and with @entity57 also around a month away , @entity0 feels the ability is there to put together the needed run of results			1
he said : ' it ( to challenge for the title ) is our target , but we have to be realistic			2
what we want is to win every game we can , but at the moment we are 14 points behind @entity3 , they need to lose five games , and they have lost only two until now			1
' what we want to do is focus on our performances and show that we can produce consistent results			0
after , where we will finish , it is difficult to say			0
' @entity75 ( left ) competes for the ball with fellow midfielders @entity28 ( centre ) and @entity25 ( right ) defender @entity11 , a new signing from @entity81 side @entity14 , trains alongside his new team - mates @entity83 ( left ) talks with @entity1 manager @entity0 ( right ) during training @entity0 added : ' yes , it is true that i have some real selection dilemmas			1
' we have got three players out ( on loan ) - ( @entity93 ) @entity92 , ( @entity94 ) @entity95 and ( @entity97 ) @entity96 - so you imagine before the number of offensive players we have			2
' now we have a good squad , compact , but of quality and with the competition it will be very hard			0
' @entity11 is expected to go straight into the squad against @entity13			2
@entity0 is confident the 24 - year - old can follow in the tradition of @entity12 's having a positive impact on the club			1
' we were lucky as we also had @entity111 and @entity112 , who is from @entity113 , and so it @entity114			0
we were very lucky with the @entity12 , they are top - level class people , ' he said			0
' football is a big meaning for them , they have the hunger and the love for football , it is in their country and it is a religion			0
' @entity53 ( left ) looks on as @entity28 ( centre ) tries to keep the ball away from @entity25 ( right ) @entity126 ( right ) controls a pass from team - mate @entity128 ( left ) as @entity11 closes them down @entity57 catches his breath as he continues his comeback from injury in @entity1 training @entity0 is now the longest - serving manager in the @entity6			1
the 65 - year - old is often a sounding board for issues within the game , and reflected on the recent developments in the @entity141 presidential campaign			0
whomever is eventually chosen , @entity0 feels continuing to improve the game in emerging nations is paramount to progress			2
' you would say to keep developing the game in @entity144 and to structure the game in @entity145 and as well to give better education to young people and young players , ' @entity0 said			2
' i believe there is a great job to do at @entity141 and you look at some continents with great potential and not enough players come out			0
in some continents football has become hugely popular to watch and the next target is to develop football in there			0
' it is difficult to imagine that @entity161 has 1.4billion and they do not find 11 good players , or maybe there are too many and you do n't find the right one			0
' @entity0 , though , is not about to follow the likes of former @entity169 midfielder @entity168 into football politics			2
he said : ' i have great experience on the technical front , but after that , on the administration front , i am a bit limited in my experience and i am not really interested in a lot of hand shaking			0
