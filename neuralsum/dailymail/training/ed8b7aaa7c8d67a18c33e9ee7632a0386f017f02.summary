for even the slightest misjudgment in ballistics , distance or breathing rate is the difference between life and death			0
you play captain @entity12 , aka ‘ @entity15 ’ , who travels the world with his spotter , taking out various high - profile targets			0
view to a kill : in ghost warrior 2 you travel to a variety of real - world locations , using a selection of authentic weapons and equipment similar to its multi-million - selling predecessor , this first - person shooter focuses on sniping – with the popular @entity27 returning to show off skilful long range kills			1
thankfully , to avoid the somewhat linear nature of the original , @entity29 have improved close quarters combat , too			1
secure the area : unlike its predecessor , close - quarters combat does n't feel disjointed , with knife takedowns , in particular , a real highlight there ’s now a much greater array of short - range pistols and assault rifles on offer , while brutal knife - takedowns act as a perfect incentive to get up close and personal			1
graphically , the game improves on the original in every way			0
powered by the @entity50 , war - torn cities and dense jungles boast spectacular lighting effects , backed up with the engine ’s trademark motion blur and depth of field			1
waiting in the shadows : those after @entity58 - style thrills may want to look elsewhere			0
it pays to be patient in ghost warrior 2 speaking to @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and marketing director for @entity65 said : ' naturally , we wanted to improve the game and build on the success of the original sniper : @entity70 to ensure @entity71 will provide fans with an incredible , immersive sniping experience			2
vantage point : you 'll have to listen to your spotter 's advice if you 're to eliminate your target ' thanks to the use of the immensely powerful @entity50 , the game looks stunning and provides an incredibly realistic experience			1
' with a wide variety of weapons and missions to get to grips with and shots that require the player to consider a whole host of environmental factors , sniper : @entity71 will deliver the most authentic sniping experience to date			2
’ stunning : compared with the rather dull and drab original , @entity70 2 looks wonderful across all platforms			0
however , expect the @entity50 3 to look best on pc follow @entity0 on @entity96 : @ @entity97 and on @entity98 : @entity99 .			2

realistic ballistics ensure truly authentic experience
