by @entity0 for @entity1 a series of photos celebrating the majesty of the @entity6 landscape have been released to celebrate 50 years of a landmark act put into place to preserve vast swathes of untamed and beautiful land			1
the photos , featured in the september issue of @entity13 , show the rugged vistas of @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
president @entity18 signed the @entity19 in 1964 to give future generations a ' glimpse of the world as it was in the beginning '			1
the @entity19 was signed into law by president @entity18 on september 3 , 1964			1
but to understand the genesis of the act , you have to go back another three decades , to the 1930s , writes @entity13 's @entity29			2
@entity30 : forty years before the @entity19 , 755,000 acres in @entity15 ’s @entity31 , including the @entity32 of the @entity33 , became the world ’s first designated wilderness icy calm : day breaks on the @entity37 in @entity16			1
the mountains and plains in this region shelter a rich collection of plants and wildlife , including grizzly bears @entity45 , @entity17 , is part of a thousand - acre national monument created last year by president @entity48			2
@entity19 , a higher form of land protection , covers 350 acres of the @entity51 — but only @entity52 can designate a wilderness during the @entity55 tens of thousands of @entity54 were put to work by the federal government in national parks and forests			1
they cleared trails , erected shelters , and laid down mile after mile of pavement			0
the @entity63 in @entity64 was opened in 1933 , @entity65 in @entity66 in 1939			0
the new highways opened up the parks to millions more visitors			0
but the very success of these efforts troubled many conservationists , who worried that the country 's most majestic landscapes were being turned into so many roadside attractions			0
a group of them , including @entity79 , got together to defend the national parks and forests against overuse			0
they called themselves the @entity84 , and their first mission statement denounced the roadbuilding ' craze			0
' ' the fashion is to barber and manicure wild @entity54 as smartly as the modern girl , ' it said			1
' our duty is clear			0
' in 1924 , while working with the @entity94 in @entity15 , @entity79 had persuaded his superiors to designate 755,000 acres of the @entity31 as roadless wilderness			1
the challenge was to persuade @entity52 to give that idea national scope			0
@entity100 clings to aspens near @entity102 , @entity15 , in the @entity103			0
a proposal to protect 45,000 acres here in the @entity106 is one of some 30 wilderness bills before @entity52 @entity110 yuccas soak up morning light in southern @entity15			1
' i am not finished , ' the president said in may , as he created this newest national monument			2
' i ’m searching for more opportunities ' the @entity19 went through more than 60 drafts before it finally passed			0
it created a new category of federal lands that could be overlaid on the old like a transparency on a map			0
@entity52 — and only @entity52 — could place land in the new category			0
once designated as wilderness , a tract would be off - limits to commercial ventures like logging and new mines			2
it would be available for humans to explore , but not with mechanized vehicles			0
horses and canoes are allowed ; mountain bikes have been ruled out			0
' a wilderness , ' the statute observed in surprisingly lyrical terms , is ' an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man , where man himself is a visitor who does not remain			2
' the 1964 act set aside 54 such areas			1
the pictures feature in september 's edition of @entity13			2
right , @entity149 in @entity150 , @entity151 ' if future generations are to remember us with gratitude rather than contempt , ' president @entity18 said after signing the act , then ' we must leave them a glimpse of the world as it was in the beginning , not just after we got through with it			1
' since @entity18 signed the act , the number of wilderness areas has increased to more than 750			1
they range from the tiny @entity164 in central @entity165 , which is just 5.5 acres , to the immense @entity150 – @entity19 , which at nearly 9.1 million acres is bigger than @entity166			1
all told , officially designated wilderness covers five per cent of the @entity54 , an area larger than @entity169			1
the newest wilderness area , part of @entity172 on @entity173 , was added just this past march .			2

there are now 750 wilderness areas , covering five per cent of the @entity54 landmass
the act was signed into law in september 1964 by president @entity18 to preserve the landscape
some are just a few acres , while the largest covers 9.1 million acres and is larger than @entity166
