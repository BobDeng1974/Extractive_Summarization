@entity0 , @entity1 is one of @entity3 's daughters undoubtedly the @entity4 would sympathise with his predicament			1
an elderly baron with eight daughters and a 6,000 - acre estate faces his title being passed to a distant cousin – because he has no sons			1
the dilemma echoes the plot of @entity16 series @entity14 , where the @entity4 grapples with the problem of having three daughters but no male heir			1
but in the real - life drama , the case of the 10th @entity3 has prompted a campaign to change the ancient law that stops daughters from inheriting titles			1
peers are asking the government – which is already legislating so that if the @entity29 and @entity29 of @entity31 ’s firstborn is a girl she can accede the throne – to make an amendment to the rules covering hereditary titles			1
his eldest daughter , @entity37 , scaled down her business as an interior designer to take over the reins at the vast estate			1
but when her father dies , his title – created in 1788 – will pass to a distant cousin she has never met , because peerages can only go to male heirs			0
mrs @entity37 , 50 , said she was aware the predicament of herself and her sisters – who include @entity0 , @entity1 – might arouse public irritation rather than sympathy , but added : ‘ it boils down to this : if i was a boy , i would be sitting pretty			1
‘ my poor father had no son , just lots of daughters			2
in this day and age , with supposed equality , why am i not allowed to inherit my father ’s title ? it is discriminatory			0
‘ i am managing the estate , including the steam railway , so i am already doing a man ’s job			2
’ it was a similar scenario in the @entity16 drama when the @entity4 , played by @entity70 , was horrified to discover that @entity14 would pass on his death to distant cousin – and ‘ country solicitor ’ – @entity74 , played by @entity75			0
but in the series , the problem was solved when @entity74 fell in love with and married @entity79 , the eldest of the @entity4 ’s three daughters			2
a similar problem also affected @entity82 and her four sisters in @entity85 ’s @entity84			0
they faced being left penniless because , with no male heir , their fortune was due to pass to cousin @entity90 , whom none of them wanted to marry			0
in real life , upon the 10th @entity3 ’s death his title will pass to @entity96 , a fourth cousin once removed			1
mr @entity96 , 35 , is single and owns a flat above a hairdressing salon in @entity99			0
mrs @entity37 said she knew nothing about him , although mr @entity96 has said he has met the baron and some of his other daughters , and rode on the @entity105 miniature railway in the 1980s			2
the entrepreneur , who has a stake in events and venue website thehandbook.com , has declined to discuss the baronetcy			0
real life dilemma : @entity3 ( pictured centre with his wife , right , and one of his daughters , @entity37 second from left ) will leave his estate to a distant cousin they barely know heir apparent : @entity96 ( pictured with an unknown woman ) , a fourth cousin once removed , is set to inherit the 6,000 - acre estate			1
he currently lives in a flat above a hairdressing salon in @entity99 but while he will inherit the title , it remains unclear whether he will automatically gain ownership of the estate			2
@entity105 is a 17th century country house and renowned as one of the finest @entity130 houses in @entity131			0
it was requisitioned during the @entity132 and used by the @entity133 , the forerunner of @entity134			0
mrs @entity37 said her father had examined whether the title could skip a generation and pass to her son , who is 20 – but the law is clear that it may not			0
stately home : the @entity130 - style @entity105 powerless : in @entity14 , the @entity4 's daughters ( pictured ) can not inherit the estate because they are girls heir : the character of @entity74 ( pictured ) was set to inherit @entity14 , even though he is a distant cousin			1

the 10th @entity3 has prompted a campaign to change the law that stops daughters inheriting titles
aged 80 he can not manage the estate so his daughter has taken charge
she said : ' it boils down to this : if i was a boy , i would be sitting pretty . '
