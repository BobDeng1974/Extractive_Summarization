by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 07:05 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 07:08 est , 18 july 2013 @entity3 and @entity4 today stepped up government pressure on @entity7 golf club to end its ban on women members			1
as the prestigious @entity11 began at the historic course , the prime minister condemned policies which ' look more to the past than they do to the future ' while his deputy tore into the ' inexplicable ' and ' anachronistic ' rules			1
culture secretary @entity18 is boycotting the @entity11 in protest as her @entity21 opponent @entity20 called for male - only clubs to be banned by law			1
row : @entity3 and @entity4 spoke out against the ' anachronistic ' male - only rules which they said belong in the past teeing off : the controversy erupted as play got under way at the @entity11 which is being held at @entity7 , @entity29 but boycotted by senior ministers @entity7 , in @entity29 , has been home to the @entity7 - one of the oldest clubs in the world - since 1891			1
@entity35 ’s first minister @entity34 , culture secretary mrs @entity18 and sport minister @entity37 have all announced they will boycott this week ’s golf for its perceived sexism			1
however it has faced a storm of controversy in the run - up to the @entity11 because it still refuses to admit women members			1
the prime minister 's spokesman said mr @entity3 was not attending the @entity11 and ' entirely understands ' why mrs @entity18 was not going			1
asked about all - male clubs , he added : ' the prime minister has a great deal of sympathy with the view that exclusive memberships of this sort look more to the past than they do to the future			1
' mr @entity4 used his @entity58 phone - in to voice his opposition to the male - only policy : ' i was just dismayed and incredibly surprised to hear this still goes on in this day and age			2
' i find it so out of step with everything else that 's happening in the rest of society			0
' i think many people will just shake their head and say " how on earth is this still possible in this day and age ? "			0
' demand for action : @entity18 wants further action after the offensive comments were made however the head of golf 's governing body claimed male - only golf clubs are ‘ for some people a way of life that they rather like ’			1
@entity84 , chief executive of the @entity85 , insisted that it was not sexist to exclude women from clubs			0
he said yesterday : ‘ i really do n’t think that a golf club that has a policy of being a place where like - minded men or indeed women go , play golf together and do their thing together , ranks up against some of these other forms of discrimination			2
‘ for some people , it is a way of life they rather like			0
i do n’t think they are intending to do others down			0
you can dress it up to be a lot more if you want			0
‘ but if on a sunday morning the guy , or the lady , gets out of the marital bed , if you like , and plays golf with his chums and comes back in the afternoon - that is not on any kind of par with racial discrimination or anti-semitism			0
’ the row comes after culture secretary mrs @entity18 also delivered an extraordinary attack on the @entity118 ’s sexist sports coverage			1
in a scathing letter to the director - general lord hall , she expressed her anger at presenter @entity123 ’s remarks about @entity124 singles champion @entity125			1
mrs @entity18 , who also called for better coverage of women ’s sport , demanded updates on ‘ further action that is likely to be taken ’ over the comments , which prompted hundreds of complaints to the @entity118			1
earlier this month @entity132 , who is thought to be paid about £ 600,000 a year , said of @entity134 during coverage of the @entity124 women ’s final : ‘ i just wonder if her dad did say to her when she was 12 , 13 , 14 maybe : “ listen , you are never going to be , you know , a looker			2
‘ “ you are never going to be somebody like a [ @entity18 ] @entity142 , you ’re never going to be 5 feet 11 , you ’re never going to be somebody with long legs , so you have to compensate for that			2
you are going to have to be the most dogged , determined fighter that anyone has ever seen on the tennis court if you are going to make it			0
” and she kind of is			0
’ the comments generated more than 700 complaints , and led to demands that @entity132 should be sacked			2
but the 55 - year - old escaped severe sanction by writing a letter of apology to the @entity159 champion , and apologising on - air the day after the final			0
@entity159 tennis player @entity125 , was the subject of @entity163 's comments			1
the beleaguered presenter faced criticism several years ago after he seemed to joke about the @entity167 ’s appearance she told @entity169 : ‘ i am writing to express my concern over the comments made by @entity123 about @entity125 , during the @entity118 ’s radio coverage of the @entity124 women ’s final			1
’ she added : ‘ it is ... a matter of some concern to me that any comment on the looks and stature of a female athlete could be made in the context of one of the highlights of the @entity184 ’s , and indeed the world ’s , sporting calendar			0
‘ i am sure you will agree with me that it is vital that young women and girls in this country feel motivated both to take part in and to watch coverage of sport , and to know that they are included in the enjoyment of sport , and catered for by the media just as much as the male audience			2
‘ whilst i note that mr @entity123 has apologised both on - air and in writing to ms @entity125 , i would be grateful for an update on any further action that is likely to be taken following [ the ] complaints , and whether there may be positive steps that the @entity118 could take in the future to ensure that the perception of and commentary on female athletes , and women ’s sport generally , are as positive and inclusive as possible			1
’ the 55 - year - old escaped severe sanction by writing a letter of apology to the @entity159 champion , and apologising on - air the day after the final the letter was also copied to the chairman of the @entity216 , @entity217			0
@entity132 is already set to be replaced as the @entity118 ’s main athletics presenter by a woman , @entity218 , who agreed that his comments on @entity125 ‘ was n’t appropriate ’			1
the beleaguered @entity132 faced down criticism several years ago after he seemed to joke about the @entity167 ’s appearance			0
in a radio interview with @entity226 in 2006 , he asked if his studio colleagues could remember the name of the horse @entity230 rode when she won the @entity231 in 1971			0
when no answer was forthcoming , he suggested : ‘ @entity233			0
’ his latest comments drew a furious response from other sports stars and politicians			0
men ’s singles champion @entity239 ’s mother @entity238 described it as a ‘ huge gaffe ’			0
a @entity118 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity118 has made clear that @entity123 ’s comments were unacceptable and fell well beneath the standards expected of our presenters			1
‘ @entity123 sincerely regrets that he made such an inappropriate statement and for the offence caused			2
as he said on - air the following day , he has written to @entity125 to apologise and the @entity118 has also apologised for @entity123 ’s remarks			1
’ he added that ‘ the @entity118 has a proud record of supporting women ’s sport , with the current coverage of @entity253 [ the women ’s football @entity254 ] the most recent highlight in a summer of unprecedented coverage ’			2
of the 16 @entity253 matches it will show , 14 will be on @entity257 , with just two on @entity118			0
the letter was also copied to the chairman of the @entity216 , @entity217 the spokesman also stressed that the @entity118 has appointed an ‘ editorial lead ’ for women ’s sport ‘ which has helped ensure significantly increased coverage across our daily sporting output ’ , while the company as a whole ‘ is taking steps to clearly communicate to those who work for us what constitutes inappropriate behaviour or language ’			1
a @entity118 source claimed the @entity163 controversy was a ‘ one - off ’			2
however , the outrage following the @entity125 comments does not mark the first time the @entity118 ’s sports coverage has been criticised due to sexism			1
@entity281 , who became @entity283 ’s first woman commentator in 2007 , said she had a ‘ very difficult time ’ due to outdated attitudes			0
‘ mentally it was a huge challenge			0
i did n’t enjoy it for a second , i ca n’t pretend i did , ’ she said			0
the @entity118 also drew criticism when no women made the ten - strong shortlist for the @entity292 award in 2011			2
in the row over @entity7 ’s men - only policy , mrs @entity18 is to be joined in her boycott of the @entity11 by sports minister @entity37 and @entity34			2
last weekend mrs @entity18 accused golf of turning a blind eye to sexism , saying : ‘ @entity11 is the biggest tournament in golf and it sends out completely the wrong message for it to be held at clubs that do n’t allow women members			1
‘ @entity304 ’s governing bodies should be doing all they can to promote equality and address the sexism that still exists in some quarters , not turning a blind eye to it			0
