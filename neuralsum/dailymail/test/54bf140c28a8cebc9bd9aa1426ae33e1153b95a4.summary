parents @entity1 and @entity2 want their children to have the best possible start in life			1
and like many others , they have come to believe that a private education is the best way to achieve it			0
but so desperate are they to get their son @entity1 – known to them as @entity12 – into a local prep school that they ’ve put their house on the market in order to pay the fees			1
and that ’s not all			0
they ’ve also slashed their weekly grocery bills by more than half , taken in lodgers , and have pinned their hopes on a ‘ crowd - funding ’ initiative , hoping members of the public will help them achieve their dream			1
they are selling it for £ 185,000 to help pay for @entity34 's prep school fees ‘ we believe any child will benefit more from what a private education has to offer , ’ said mrs @entity2			1
‘ there is simply no comparison			0
’ @entity46 , from @entity33 in @entity47 , settled on the idea of a private education for their children after @entity12 , who they say is academically gifted , found that he was n’t being stretched at his state primary school			1
‘ we always knew @entity12 was very bright , ’ mrs @entity2 said			1
‘ by the age of two he could recite the continents and at nursery he was identified as gifted and talented			2
‘ by six he knew what every road sign meant and was reading paperbacks			0
teachers say he is at least two years ahead academically compared with other children of the same age			2
and we ’ve been told if he continues as he is doing with his maths , he is likely to gain a maths scholarship when he goes to senior school			2
’ despite his success at the local school – rated as outstanding – the @entity46 felt he was too bright for state education and not achieving as much as expected			1
and then , they say , came a problem with playground bullying			0
‘ he won a trophy for his go - karting hobby and after taking it to school he was constantly taunted by two boys , ’ mrs @entity2 said			1
‘ he started coming home in tears			0
‘ the final straw came when one yob yelled in his face and another punched @entity12 for nothing			0
the staff agreed it was an unprovoked attack but @entity12 no longer wanted to go to school			2
he started biting his nails and becoming withdrawn			0
‘ friends and family ca n’t understand why we are giving up everything ' to send @entity12 to the £ 4,000 a term school , says mum @entity2 heartbroken , the @entity46 kept their son at home and contacted their local council to see if he could be transferred to a different primary school , but no places were available			1
eventually in august 2014 – and with @entity12 refusing to return to his state school – he sat the entrance exam for @entity99			1
mrs @entity2 said : ‘ he sailed through the exam and when we looked round the school , we all fell in love with it			1
there is a big emphasis on good manners there – something that simply was n’t emphasised as important at @entity12 ’s old school			2
he loved it and in september started as a day pupil			0
’ but at £ 4,000 a term , the fees were crippling for the family , particularly as their income depended on mr @entity118 ’s work as a taxi driver			1
however , having seen their son join the choir and become part of the water polo and hockey teams , all within just a term , the family decided to cash in the only real asset they possessed			2
‘ our net monthly household income is £ 2,300 , ’ said mrs @entity2			1
‘ after bills and the mortgage have been paid , i ’m often left with just £ 50 a week for food			0
but we just want the best for @entity12			0
‘ friends and family ca n’t understand why we are giving up everything			0
they think we are mad to pauper ourselves to give @entity12 – and ultimately his four - year - old brother @entity36 – a private education			0
’ as well as putting their house on the market , the @entity46 have taken in a number of lodgers and have set up a ‘ gofundme ’ account in the hope of attracting donations of £ 115,000 from the public			1
mr @entity118 works as a taxi driver meaning the @entity149 fees were crippling for the family , forcing them to sell their house , take in lodgers and attempt crowd - funding to afford them ‘ holidays are out and even day trips are n’t possible as we ca n’t afford the petrol , ’ said mrs @entity2			1
‘ @entity12 and @entity36 have given up their bedrooms so we can rent them out			0
it means they have to sleep in the same bedroom as @entity1 and me			1
’ private school fees are a growing problem for parents , with those on middling incomes finding themselves increasingly forced out			1
since 1990 , fees have quadrupled , with the average cost of sending two children to private school now estimated at more than half a million pounds			1
even so , figures from the @entity174 suggest that demand for private education is increasing			0
mrs @entity2 said : ‘ the fees include extras such as some after - school clubs and trips			1
his uniform alone with its different pairs of sports shoes and pe kit cost us £ 500			0
we owe £ 9,800 on three credit cards but can only afford to pay off the minimum amount every month			0
’ to help cut costs , the family ’s £ 120 weekly grocery bill has already been slashed to £ 50 , thanks to bulk - buying and plenty of home - cooking			2
the @entity46 have had to slash their weekly grocery bills by more than half to try and give @entity12 , and in future his brother @entity36 , the private education they believe they deserve ‘ our clothes come from second - hand shops and we ’ve even stopped the boys ’ pocket money , ’ mrs @entity2 added			1
once their house is sold , the @entity46 plan to rent a property , using about £ 85,000 of equity they have in their home to pay the fees			1
‘ ironically , as our mortgage is only around £ 200 a month and renting will cost about £ 1,000 , it is going to add to our outgoings , ’ mrs @entity2 said			1
‘ but this way we can sleep at night			0
we can clear our debts and , most importantly , pay for @entity12 ’s school fees			2
‘ of course some people ’s children are lucky – they sail through a state school and go on to become lawyers or doctors			2
everyone has a choice and some parents would simply not want to make the sacrifices we are doing			0
but , the facilities , the ambiance , the atmosphere – it is all so much better than any state school			2
if your child is at a private school he is simply far more likely to reach his potential			0
‘ every day i pick @entity12 up from school he has a smile on his face			0
he is full of enthusiasm and inspired by his lessons			0
‘ @entity1 and i will always know we did the very best we could			2
