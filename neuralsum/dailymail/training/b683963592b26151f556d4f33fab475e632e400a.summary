briton @entity5 , 23 , and @entity7 @entity6 , 32 , were snatched at gunpoint by a gang of kidnappers in @entity13 's @entity12 nature reserve close to the @entity15 border			1
the pair were dragged away from the river into the jungle where they were robbed before their kidnappers realised the military was closing in			1
talking on @entity39 ms @entity6 said : ' we were very scared , but we could often hear the helicopters above us and that was very comforting while we were in the jungle			1
' when the helicopters got right above us the kidnappers made us hide in the bushes and the kidnappers got scared			1
' they were , we think , close to maybe killing us			1
and then for some reason they changed their mind and told us to run and we ran out , towards the helicopters yelling , trying to get their attention			1
' @entity5 , pictured , and her fellow hostage were rescued close to the lawless @entity15 border after a farmer heard their cries for help @entity13 defence minister @entity60 said : ' they released them because of military and police pressure			1
' around 260 men from the armed forces , 150 police officers , three helicopters were involved			2
' the women were said to be in ‘ good condition ’ last night despite their terrifying ordeal			2
their nightmare began on friday afternoon as they travelled towards @entity13 ’s @entity74 with three other foreign tourists and two local guides			2
the nature reserve – made up of rivers , lagoons and forest covering 2,000 square miles – is home to more than 500 different species of birds , pink freshwater dolphins , 250 species of fish , including piranha , and alligators			2
the pair had booked the four to five - day expedition with a local tour company after arriving in the @entity94 region of @entity96 province , in the north - east of @entity13			2
the kidnappers – whom locals say have links to a notorious @entity15 drug - running gang – robbed the tourists of their cameras and phones before taking miss @entity5 , from @entity105 in @entity106 , and @entity7 miss @entity6 , 32 , at gunpoint and escaping into the forest			1
the women were abandoned later that evening after their kidnappers realised they were being tracked			2
