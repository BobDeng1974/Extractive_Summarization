the painting , which shows the silhouette of a child swinging a sledge hammer at a fire hydrant , appeared on the @entity16			1
rival graffiti artists , angered by a new presence on their ' turf ' , have raced to destroy the works , leading to some residents putting up metal shutters and plexiglass to protect them			1
several masked men tried to scrawl over the new work , but were apparently stopped by onlookers			1
while hundreds of street art enthusiasts have welcomed the @entity30 - born tagger to their city , mayor @entity27 has said he does not consider the work art and the illegal activity ' should not be permitted '			1
the work is @entity4 's 20th in the city , as he puts up one a day for his show entitled @entity39			2
vandals have so far removed the doors and wheels from a car painted by @entity4 , while other works have been painted over and pieces chipped from walls which have been ' tagged '			0
one rival was even unmasked and tackled by a security guard on camera after defacing a painting , though he escaped before police got there			2
as well as his traditional graffiti , during his stay in the city @entity4 has also set up a street stall in @entity57 selling original signed works for $ 60 each , despite being worth an estimated $ 30,000			0
his other works have included two paintings hung in an underpass in @entity74 , a car and wall painting depicting horses hunting men , and spray - painting the words ' the musical ' after other slogans painted on walls			0

it is the 20th artwork to be unveiled in the city as part of a month - long exhibition which has seen a new one appear every day the ' art ' has sharply divided opinions , with some property owners putting up shutters and screens to protect the works scrawled in their buildings , while mayor @entity103 said the activity ' should not be permitted ' several attempts have been made to unmask the as - yet unidentified artist during his stay across the pond , with one determined follower attaching a tracking device to the slaughterhouse van , though a note on @entity4 's website later revealed ' you 're now following a car service in @entity116 ' after the device was moved			1
another @entity119 user posed pictures of three men packing away one of the vans in a @entity125 cap park , saying he had found @entity4 because one of the men spoke with a @entity5 accent			2
since rising to fame during the early 2000s @entity4 's work has appeared all over the world , from @entity132 to @entity133 , and he has even made a film called @entity135			0
