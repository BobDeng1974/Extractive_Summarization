@entity0 passed another landmark on his way to becoming @entity4 ’s highest runscorer as he pursued the equally important prize of cementing his place as their @entity8 captain			1
when @entity0 slapped a @entity10 full toss to the boundary in the early stages of his reply to @entity14 ’ 299 on wednesday , he moved beyond @entity15 into second place among @entity4 ’s great test accumulators			1
now only @entity18 , the man @entity0 returned to earlier this year to try to restore his batting to full working order , stands above an @entity4 captain who is very much fighting for his leadership future in this series			1
@entity0 passed @entity15 's 8,463 runs to become @entity4 's second highest test run - scorer @entity0 had watched @entity14 ’ last pair of @entity27 and @entity28 add an unlikely 52 to undo much of the good work provided by a welcome burst of wickets from @entity32			1
it lifted the hosts to a score that should have been beyond them and left @entity0 and @entity37 , both under pressure after their failures in @entity41 , with the final session of the second day to begin the climb towards a total big enough to press for a priceless victory			1
@entity37 had been frenetic on his return to the side in @entity41 but here he was much more like his old self , scratching away at the crease and meticulous both off his pads and on the drive			2
anything short , particularly from the pacey @entity28 , was swiftly ducked			0
@entity0 , meanwhile , looked comfortable with his new stance even though he could easily have fallen on 29 off the leg - spinner @entity27			2
when bad light stopped play they had reached 74 and @entity4 , perhaps , were back on top			1
one man who definitely looked back to his best form was @entity32 , who bowled beyond 90mph for the first time since returning from surgery while claiming three wickets for 19 when rain finally relented			2
earlier the crowd for only the third test to be staged on the spice island , which included thousands of @entity4 supporters , had to display extreme patience as cricket again embarrassed itself in the face of weather problems			2
yes , there was nothing the umpires could do about the squally showers that wiped out the bulk of the morning session but there was plenty they could do as the sun shone throughout the lunch interval			0
then they could have avoided an additional 10 - minute delay when they were slow in coming back out after an afternoon shower because they said the outfield was still wet			2
what difference does 10 minutes make ? when the weather relented there was plenty of drama , not least when @entity95 gave his wicket away just two balls after reaching a century that had @entity4 , in particular @entity99 , cursing him on the first evening			1
@entity100 had clenched his fist and roared into @entity95 ’ face , earning himself a rebuke from the umpires , after making a breakthrough @entity4 badly wanted			0
the sight of his strike partner fired up seemed to bring the best from @entity32 , who then bowled his best and fastest spell of a troubled winter			0
it has taken broad time to get back to his best after knee surgery before the @entity116 but there was evidence he was approaching it here as a beauty clocked at 91mph took @entity122 ’s edge			0
@entity0 and @entity37 shared a first half - century stand after safely negotiating the final session on day two @entity32 bowled beyond 90 miles per hour for the first time since returning from knee surgery there have been serious concerns about @entity32 ’s speed , or lack thereof , since his comeback from a knee injury			1
at times in this test he has dipped below 80mph , a far cry from his best and well short of @entity136 ’s @entity135 , who will send down 90mph snorters in the @entity8			0
but @entity32 ’s speed picked up markedly in his fourth spell and he regularly touched 90mph			0
@entity140 ‘ he is much more effective when he ’s above 85mph			0
yes , it ’s hard on the body , but at 82 , 83 , there ’s nothing on it			0
’ @entity145 ‘ we saw @entity148 bowl very well in moments today			0
’ @entity150 ‘ @entity151 is certainly up ! good gas ! ’ @entity32 followed that up with the wickets of @entity155 and @entity10 , the heroes of @entity41 , but not before we had another example of the limitations of technology and another display of @entity155 ’s rich batting promise			0
@entity155 , who made a hundred in frustrating @entity4 in the first test , really does look like a proper batsman at @entity165 , as he showed when hitting two mighty sixes off @entity100 and @entity32			2
he also perhaps had a slice of luck when he pulled @entity169 to deep mid-wicket only to pick out @entity171 , who appeared to take a low catch but admitted he could not be sure he had claimed it cleanly			0
as ever , the pictures were inconclusive and @entity175 said he could not be sure whether the call had carried or not			0
this time it cost @entity4 just six runs before @entity155 was undone by @entity32 but the @entity180 really should look at this and perhaps go back to @entity183 ’s quest for the fielder ’s word to be taken on catches			1
when @entity10 fell three wickets had gone in eight overs from @entity32 at a cost of 19 runs but any hopes @entity4 had of quickly ending @entity14 innings was held up by @entity27 and @entity28			1
their stand left @entity4 running out of time if they were to move into a strong position but at least @entity0 , without a century in 33 innings , and @entity37 looked at ease against an attack lacking the best bowler in @entity41 in @entity201			1
the pair survived the odd nervous moment , notably when the captain was missed in the slips off @entity27 , as they reached their first half - century partnership as an opening pair			1
they need plenty more if @entity4 are going to have a chance of winning this second test			0
@entity4 paceman @entity32 grabbed four wickets including wicket of @entity122 @entity32 ( left ) celebrates the dismissal of @entity14 batsman @entity155 on wednesday @entity95 ( right ) celebrates reaching his century alongside @entity122			1

@entity4 paceman @entity32 back to his best with four - wicket haul
openers @entity0 and @entity37 shared first half - century stand
the *tourists* closed on 74 - 0 in reply to @entity14 ' first innings total of 299
