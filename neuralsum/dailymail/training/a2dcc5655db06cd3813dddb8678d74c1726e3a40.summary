@entity0 completed his medal collection by winning @entity3 gold in the 4x100 metres relay on saturday night and then announced this would be his first and last appearance at the @entity7			1
it was not another alleged dig at @entity10 , which @entity0 insisted put on a ‘ great competition ’ despite the weather , but an acceptance that the quickest man in history will be 31 by the time the @entity7 on @entity17 ’s @entity16 come around			1
‘ i want to be there , ’ he said , ‘ but maybe not as an athlete			1
‘ i ’ve always said that after @entity32 i will retire , ’ said the six - time @entity39 champion			1
‘ but they keep saying i should go on to 2017 so i think i might just do that			2
‘ i think that will be my last championships			2
i ’m just happy i ’ve done what i wanted to do in the sport			2
‘ i remember asking @entity46 why he retired when he was at the top and he told me that there was nothing else for him to accomplish so i think that when you ’re in the sport and you ’ve accomplished everything else then you should just retire			2
‘ there ’s all these young kids coming up and i might start getting beaten and i hate losing			2
’ the @entity23 is prone to making off - the - cuff statements about his legacy and ‘ legend ’ but , as he looked to his right and saw @entity60 ’s silver medal - winning relay quartet — with an average age of just 23 — his words seemed to carry particular resonance			1
at 27 , @entity0 is far from finished , despite seeing much of this season wiped out by the foot injury he suffered in april , but it is getting harder , even for him			1
his appeal is stronger than ever — he signed hundreds of autographs and smiled for umpteen ‘ selfies ’ during a protracted 45 - minute lap of honour wearing a tartan bonnet and scarf on saturday — but , physically , time is starting to take its toll in terms of the effort he has to put into training			1
funny man : @entity0 is known for his larger than life personality as well as his outstanding running ability admiration : athletics will be losing a sporting icon when @entity0 does choose to retire from the sport @entity87 see out ' outstanding ' @entity21 ‘ track-wise , you can feel the difference sometimes , especially after the workouts , ’ he said			1
‘ i have to take more ice baths now , which is not so much fun			0
‘ you have to work a little bit harder , put a little bit more work in and i do n’t go out as much as i used to			0
’ the nagging question of how @entity0 can remain motivated after achieving everything in his sport is more pertinent than ever , but the @entity23 still feels he has one more world record left in him			1
@entity0 thinks he has ‘ done the 100m ’ after running 9.58secs in @entity106 five years ago , but believes he could become the first man to break the 19 - second barrier for the 200m			1
his current world record is 19.19secs			0
he said : ‘ i want to run under 19secs			0
that is one of my biggest goals , one of my biggest dreams			0
‘ i do n’t know whether breaking nine seconds for the 100m is possible			0
the world keeps going round , and you never know who will show up next and dominate			0
‘ for me , my main aim is the 200m , not the 100m			0
i think i have done the 100m			0
i want to do something special for me over the 200m .			0

@entity0 is thinking about hanging up his spikes in the near future
