pay : dr @entity0 is one of around 70 executives earning more than the recommended £ 125,000			1
she takes home £ 175,000 @entity4 bosses are awarding themselves six - figure salaries far in excess of the pay they are entitled to , it emerged last night			1
some 70 executives of new regional bodies earn more than the £ 125,000 maximum recommended by the @entity4			1
twenty of the bosses , including nine specialist doctors and @entity14 , earn more than the £ 142,000 paid to the prime minister			1
one took home £ 280,000 last year , although this included the fees of the recruitment agency that headhunted him			1
mps said the huge salaries were ‘ shocking and obscene ’ given the increasingly tight constraints on the @entity4 budget			1
many of the trusts these executives run are trying to save money by rationing routine procedures such as cataract surgery , hip and knee replacements and @entity31			0
the salaries were uncovered by e-reward , an online pay research service , which analysed the pay of more than 2,500 managers at the 211 clinical commissioning groups in @entity38			0
these regional health bodies replaced primary care trusts in 2013 to control local @entity4 budgets			2
@entity42 said 56 per cent of the 225 top executives – chief officers and chief finance officers – were paying themselves more than that recommended by @entity38 , which runs the @entity46			2
the approved salary range is £ 95,000 to £ 125,000 a year , depending on the size of the clinical commissioning group			1
the biggest was paid to @entity50 , chief financial officer for @entity51 in @entity52 , at £ 280,000 , including the cost of his recruitment			1
dr @entity0 , chief executive of @entity55 in @entity56 and a doctor specialising in public health , earns £ 175,000			2
to make matters worse , some of the executives received generous redundancy payoffs when primary care trusts were abolished – before walking straight into almost identical roles at @entity65 weeks later			0
mps said the huge salaries were ‘ shocking and obscene ’ given the increasingly tight constraints on the @entity4 budget ( file image ) figures published at the weekend showed the @entity4 has spent £ 225million on the so - called revolving - door payoffs on 5,200 staff since 2013			1
the average was £ 43,000 , although some received more than £ 500,000			0
@entity76 mp @entity75 , who sits on the @entity77 , said : ‘ it is incredible that senior managers are getting paid this kind of money when the @entity4 is struggling for funds to meet soaring demand			0
‘ not only are they raking in obscene salaries , they are also unaccountable , with no regulatory body like doctors and nurses have			0
@entity76 mp @entity75 said the salaries were ' obscene ' ‘ if executives think it is okay to accept this kind of pay , it suggests they either do n’t understand the financial pressures on @entity4 finances , or they do n’t care			1
either way , most people will find this utterly shocking			0
’ dr @entity101 , chief executive of the @entity102 , said : ‘ the @entity4 needs good managers , especially in an environment of perpetual change			1
‘ however , it is galling and disheartening for many frontline nursing staff , who have been dealing with the realities of austerity year on year , to see the disproportionate rewards being given to bosses			0
‘ besides the disparity of this for hard - pressed staff enduring a pay squeeze , this is also strong evidence of the high cost of reorganising the @entity4			2
to meet the demands on the service , @entity4 funds should be going to the front line , not spent on managers or restructures			0
’ the @entity4 budget is under increasing pressure from the demands of a growing and ageing population			0
last year , its chief executive @entity127 said an extra investment of £ 8billion was needed over five years merely to maintain standards			2
@entity130 , head of executive remuneration research at e-reward , said bosses were paid a lot to ensure they did not take lucrative private - sector jobs			0
he added : ‘ there is already quite a bit of activity in the labour market for @entity65 executives , even though it is only a couple of years since their establishment			0

one executive took home £ 280,000 last year - double the prime minister
some 70 other executives earn more than the £ 125,000 recommended *cap*
mps said the salaries were ' shocking and obscene ' given tight @entity4 cuts
