by @entity0 published : 16:46 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 17:13 est , 7 september 2012 scholars at @entity2 in @entity3 believe a collector may have what would be just the second known photo of @entity7			1
the college says the collector , who wishes to remain anonymous , bought the photo in 1995 in @entity10			1
he took it to the college 's archive and special collections staff in 2007 , and they 've been researching it ever since			2
coming of age : in this , the second ever photograph of @entity7 ( left ) is pictured with her friend @entity20 ( right ) last month , it was publicly shown during the @entity23 conference in @entity24 , @entity25			1
the daguerreotype , dated around 1859 , appears to show @entity7 sitting next to a friend , @entity20			2
there 's strong evidence it 's @entity7 , including comparisons of high - resolution digital images of the newer photo with the known image , from 1847 , said @entity34 , head of the archive and special collections department at @entity2			1
@entity34 said perhaps the best evidence is an ophthalmological report that compared similarities in the eyes and facial features of the women in the photos			0
' i believe strongly that these are the same people , ' concluded the doctor who wrote the report			0
researchers are also trying to get higher resolution pictures of the dress in the picture , to see if it matches fabric samples known to belong to @entity7			2
researchers ca n't yet definitively say the photo is @entity7 , but ' i think we can get beyond reasonable doubt , ' @entity34 said			1
younger life : in the only other photograph of @entity7 she is seen as a frail , teen girl that could shift some perceptions about the @entity64 native , @entity34 said			1
for instance , a book in the 1950s was the first to propose @entity7 had a lesbian relationship with @entity20 , @entity34 said			0
' this is photographic evidence of their friendship , whatever the nature of that friendship was , ' he said			0
the photo contradicts a misconception that @entity7 never left her house , when in fact she was quite social in her younger years , @entity34 said			2
the revelation has got scholars at @entity2 in @entity3 excited it also offers a strikingly different image from the existing photo of @entity7 as a frail , teen girl , which was taken before she began writing poetry			1
the newer image was taken when she was roughly 30			0
' this is really when she 's coming into the height of her powers , ' @entity34 said			0
' to see her as this fully mature woman rather than this sickly little girl , i think it just shifts the way people think about what she 's writing			0
' @entity64 's collections department has a copy of the daguerreotype , which it says can be viewed on request .			0

only the second ever photograph of @entity7
owned by an anonymous collector who bought the image in 1995
scholars at @entity2 in @entity3 have been researching the photo since 2007
