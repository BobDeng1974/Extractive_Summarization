a plan to ban a new drug that would help thousands of women with an incurable immune system disease has been put on hold			1
the @entity6 rationing body said @entity7 was too expensive at £ 9,000 a year despite there being no alternative treatments for lupus			1
but patient groups , doctors and drug makers @entity11 won an appeal against the decision not to fund the drug on the @entity6			1
@entity17 : benlysta can help treat the symptoms of lupus the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) will now reconsider banning the drug , which is available in the @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			2
around 25,000 @entity25 , mostly women , suffer from lupus , in which the body turns on itself by producing antibodies that attack tissue and organs , causing pain , fatigue and potentially life - threatening damage			2
@entity7 is the first treatment specifically developed to treat the disease for half a century and trials show it improves patients ’ health and wellbeing			2
at present patients are given cheap , off - patent steroids to reduce inflammation and occasionally an anti-cancer drug that has no proven efficacy			0
an estimated 5,000 patients a year whose disease can not be controlled would be eligible to receive the new drug , given monthly by infusion			2
but in april @entity20 , which covers @entity51 and @entity52 , and its @entity54 equivalent the @entity50 said @entity7 , also known as belimumab , was not cost - effective			0
however , @entity11 claims it has priced the drug ‘ responsibly ’ through a discount scheme that will cut the amount actually paid by the @entity6			1
the appeal to @entity20 was made by @entity11 and the charity @entity61 and the @entity62 , representing gps			0
the @entity64 also called for a re-think , saying a ban could have a ‘ devastating international impact on the survival of this important new treatment			0
‘ it may have a chilling effect on the future development of new lupus drugs thereby denying physicians and patients appropriate treatment options ’ it said in a 5,000 - strong petition			0
@entity78 , general manager , @entity11 @entity61 said the drug was the first specifically developed for lupus in 50 years			0
he said ‘ the outcome of the appeal is a positive step towards potentially gaining @entity6 access to @entity7			1
support : @entity11 brought the appeal against plans to ban the drug ‘ however , the restrictive nature of the @entity20 appraisal and appeal process remains a challenge and we continue to be concerned about our probability of achieving a successful outcome and reversing the negative determination			1
‘ ultimately , gaining access to @entity7 for @entity61 patients remains our primary objective and we are committed to making this happen , as we believe that this is a really important treatment innovation for certain types of adult patients living with lupus			1
’ the ban heightened criticism of @entity20 by drug companies and campaigners who say @entity6 patients are failing to benefit from drugs – some of which have been developed here – because they are judged too expensive			1
a @entity20 spokeswoman said ‘ the appeal panel has upheld two points and has directed that the final appraisal determination be returned to the independent appraisal committee			0
‘ once this has been added to the committee ’s work schedule the website will be updated accordingly			0
‘ @entity124 is not in a position to make any further comments on the appraisal until after the committee has had the opportunity to consider and address the points which have been upheld by the appeal panel			0

the @entity6 rationing body said @entity7 was too expensive at £ 9,000 a year despite there being no alternative treatments for lupus .
but an appeal has ruled that a ban on the drug is put on hold
