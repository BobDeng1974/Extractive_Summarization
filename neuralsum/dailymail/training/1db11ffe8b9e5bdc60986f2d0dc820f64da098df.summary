a @entity1 plane flew 13 times with structural damage after a turbulence event on approach to @entity6 , a preliminary report has found			1
an initial investigation by the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) found damage ' consistent with an overstress condition ' was likely to have occurred on february 20			1
while the 68 passenger @entity14 turbo - prop was initially removed from service and an inspection carried out , it was back in the air the next day			2
a report has found a @entity1 plane flew 13 times with structural damage after the aircraft suffered during turbulence it was not until five days later , following a suspected bird strike as the plane descended into @entity26 , that the damage linked to the february 20 event was discovered			1
in the five - day period , the plane had already flown 13 more times			1
according to the @entity9 report , it was about 4.40pm on february 20 when , as the aircraft made its approach to @entity6 at an altitude of 8500 feet , that ' the crew noticed the air speed going up quickly and the speed trend excessively high '			1
the first officer reduced engine power and used touch - control steering to temporarily disconnect the autopilot before manually raising the nose to control the speed			0
but the captain was unsure if the first officer 's control inputs were sufficient to avoid an ' overspeed ' and put one of his hands on the controls and disconnected the autopilot to raise the nose further			0
the aircraft was approaching @entity6 in february when the damage was suffered ' the captain believed he indicated his intention to take over control , and while the first officer could not recall it being verbalised , he was aware of the captain 's actions , ' the report says			1
' the first officer recalled that he took his hands off the controls , releasing touch - control steering in the process			0
shortly after , concerned about a high nose - up attitude , the first officer put his hands back on the controls			0
to both crew members , what happened next was unexpected and unclear			0
' ' suddenly , the crew felt high positive ( g - force ) , the controls felt different and spongy , and cockpit warnings activated			0
' ' at some point , the cabin crew called the cockpit and advised that the senior cabin crew member had injured her leg and that it might be broken			0
' the inspection on february 25 ' found broken carbon plies , cracked joint sealant , and deformation in and around the area where the horizontal stabiliser attaches to the vertical stabiliser '			0
' there was also some minor damage to the rudder , ' the report says			2
the @entity9 says its initial examination showed that ' differential force on the control column that resulted from the captain and first officer applying an opposing force exceeded the differential force required to generate a pitch disconnect '			2
' each pilot was then controlling the elevator on their side of the aircraft in opposite directions for a brief period before the first officer released his control column			0
' the @entity9 investigation is ongoing			2
in a brief statement , @entity1 said the safety of guests , crew and aircraft was its no.1 priority			1
' while this is an isolated issue , we are working with the @entity9 , the aircraft manufacturer and our maintenance provider to identify what has occurred , ' the airline said .			1
