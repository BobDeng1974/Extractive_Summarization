twelve months ago , @entity0 was playing @entity2 second - tier football in front of just 10,000 short - sleeved supporters on the holiday island of @entity6			1
life was good ; he was turning out for his hometown club and his friends and family were in the stands to enjoy his breakthrough season			2
twelve months on and the 21 - year - old is a @entity15 regular playing in front of 52,000 at @entity17 , some 2,500 miles from his @entity19 nest			1
@entity0 ( left ) has already received heavy praise from his manager at @entity22 , @entity23 the @entity22 team celebrate with @entity0 after he scored the winning goal against @entity26 at @entity17 ' life , however , is even better ; he is scoring goals as part of a winning team – his audacious back - heel at @entity32 ‘ the best i have ever scored ’ – and earning plaudits aplenty , from his @entity22 manager @entity23 to club legend @entity36			1
but the surrounds are very different			0
gone are the balmy winters which would welcome late - night tapas and trips to the beach			2
instead , friday night sees @entity0 and his brother , @entity42 , don their coats and head to @entity46 to watch @entity48 rugby team , even picking up fish and chips on their way home			1
one thing which the drop in temperature has not dulled , however , is @entity0 ’s goalscoring instinct			1
sixteen for @entity6 last term has been followed by three from as many starts for the @entity60			0
it ’s little wonder that his fish - and - chip paper has been carrying his name in recent weeks			2
‘ i ’ve settled in much quicker than i ever imagined i would , ’ says @entity0 , who headed the decisive goal at @entity66 , nicked the winner against @entity26 and added his goal - of - the - season contender at @entity69			1
@entity0 spreads his arms wide in celebration after scoring at @entity69 against @entity32 the @entity73 @entity72 international ( second left ) has a shot blocked by @entity77 goalkeeper @entity76 ‘ being in @entity22 is a very different way of life to @entity6			1
for a start the climate is very different			0
‘ the city itself is beautiful and i really love being here and i ’m trying different traditions			0
i have been to the rugby and have even tried fish and chips			0
yes , i do feel the cold and i have been told by a lot of people that this is nothing and there is much more to come			0
‘ but i have lots of coats and jumpers ready and i am happy to adapt			0
it wo n’t be a problem			0
’ nothing , it seems , is a problem for the @entity73 under - 21 striker at present , on or off the pitch			1
@entity23 says @entity0 is ‘ a nice , bright boy and low maintenance to manage ’ while labelling him ‘ a fearless predator ’ on the field			1
in the wake of his £ 1.6million arrival in june , however , @entity23 suggested this would be a season of adaptation for the rookie , who spoke very little @entity112			0
as it is , with @entity114 struggling for fitness and others out of form , @entity0 is leading the line in a side which has won six on the spin			1
@entity0 takes the applause of the @entity22 faithful as he leaves the pitch at @entity17 @entity0 takes on @entity77 defender @entity125 during @entity22 's @entity15 match on november 22 ‘ i am a bit surprised at how quickly i have adapted ( on the pitch ) and how well things are going , but i have never questioned whether i would be a success because being confident is a really important part of being a footballer , ’ adds @entity0 , who enjoyed his best game yet during saturday ’s 1 - 0 win over @entity77 which lifted @entity22 to fifth			1
‘ i know my own ability and what i can achieve			0
i know i am smaller than a lot of players and that i have to improve physically , but i enjoy going to the gym and training on my own because i can see the benefits of it further down the line			0
‘ i am aware i still have a lot to improve on , but the most important thing is that @entity22 are at the right end of the table and if i can play my part in that i will be very satisfied			1
’ this , then , is still very much the start of @entity0 ’s story , although he admits the narrative is gathering pace			1
indeed , two months ago he was playing for @entity154 ’s under - 21s against @entity155			1
‘ things have changed quite a lot for me in just a few weeks , ’ he reflects			0
‘ the @entity66 game was a great opportunity for me			0
making the team was a great honour and i knew i had to grab that chance with both hands			0
‘ to score was a dream come true - and i do n’t score with too many headers			2
‘ in the past , i have only scored one or two so if you had told me my first @entity15 goal would be a header , i would not have believed it			2
‘ then to score the winner against @entity26 was amazing			0
this is a memory i will cherish for the rest of my life			1
i will always remember that game and what the goal meant , the celebrations with the fans and the noise inside the stadium			0
‘ whatever happens for the rest of my career and in my life , that will live with me forever			2
’ with @entity0 , you get the impression the best is yet to come .			2
