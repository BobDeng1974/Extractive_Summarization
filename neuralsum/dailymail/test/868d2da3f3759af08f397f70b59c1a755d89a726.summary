the father of the little girl who starred in a photograph that sent the internet into a frenzy because of a mystery pair of boots has ' no idea ' what the object could be			1
@entity10 , 38 , photographed his young daughter - who he wished not be named - standing near a rocky outcrop in @entity13 , @entity14 , in july 2014			1
he said he was living and working in @entity15 , around an hour north , and wanted to send a picture ' to my wife , who was at work '			2
' i took a series of them , ' mr @entity10 said via email			1
' it was n't until i was checking them later in the evening that i just happened to notice the boots behind her in that one shot			2
' ' i showed my wife immediately			2
she was considerably more upset by it than i was , to be honest			0
@entity10 ( pictured with his daughter , who he wished not to be named ) said he had ' no idea ' what the item could be a trick of the light or paranormal forces at play ? there is chatter online about what the cause of this apparent black boot apparition is eerie : a pair of black boots are clearly seen behind the little girl - even though her photographer father apparently does not recall a person standing there the @entity50 user who posted the controversial image online suggested they could be samurai boots - although others are not so sure mr @entity10 gave permission for his friend , @entity55 , to post the image to @entity50 - where it became a topic of ' mostly negative ' discussion - until it resurfaced this week ' i just kind of obsessed over that one photo for a couple of hours that evening and then tried to forget about it			1
' i really do n't like dwelling on stuff like this , to be honest - it freaks me out			1
' the photograph has sparked considerable debate on the website @entity50 , with sceptics arguing whether the picture was modified , if there was a person standing behind the girl or if it was all a trick of the light			1
mr @entity10 insisted there was ' no one ' else in the vicinity - and said it had not been photoshopped , despite sceptics believing otherwise			1
' i certainly would have noticed someone standing behind her in one of the shots , ' he said			0
' she likely would n't even have posed for the picture in that case , because she 's incredibly shy '			1
in this picture from the same set , no one appears to be standing behind this little girl however , in this other supplied picture , the black boots have returned ' i have no idea what the boots are , where they come from or what they could represent			1
' all i can tell you is that i totally get the cynicism ...			0
if i saw that online i would view it exactly the same way			0
' i can assure you , though , that it was just the two of us in the area and the photo is 100 % untouched			0
he said he showed his friend @entity108 , 38 , the picture on a camping trip around a month later			2
mr @entity108 , a @entity111 , then posted it to @entity50 under the username @entity114			0
' we 're not saying it 's a ghost , ' said mr @entity108 , who is working in @entity14 , where his friend was also living until a few months ago			0
friends : @entity55 ( left ) posted the picture to @entity50 , where it took off			0
both @entity10 and @entity55 sceptics have noted the presence of a blue piece of fabric lingering behind the little girl he added that he had just been ' speculating ' previously when he said on @entity50 that the boots appeared to be ' samurai boots '			1
he said there were more convincing posts on @entity50 that argued it was actually the image of an @entity131 era uniform			0
particularly given a flash of blue fabric that appeared above her left arm			0
' i hope someone can put this through some sort of image - analysis software , ' he said			0
' we are n't trying to pull some sort of scam here			0
we 're just saying " we ca n't explain this , and it 's a bit unsettling "			2
' mr @entity10 , who lives in @entity147 with his wife and child , has an open mind			2
' i 'm about as skeptical as they come when it comes to the paranormal , so your guess is as good as mine			1

no one else was there , says the little girl 's father , who took the picture
@entity10 said their picture was not photoshopped
he also said no one was standing behind the girl
sceptics believe it could be a rocky outcrop or trick of the light
