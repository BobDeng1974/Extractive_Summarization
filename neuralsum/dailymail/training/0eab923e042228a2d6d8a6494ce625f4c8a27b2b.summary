you may or may not have noticed , but the grand global football extravaganza that is the @entity2 begins this thursday in @entity3 – and the clamour to fit in with this sporting hurrah and share in a little of its thunder is now reaching a state close to frenzy			1
and the latest interloper to climb onto what is already a fairly crowded bandwagon – along with all the beer makers , fast - food manufacturers and sugary drink producers – is the @entity17 , the iconic sculpture which dominates @entity20 ’s @entity19			1
going for gold : the @entity17 as it will appear if @entity22 win the @entity2 ( left ) , and as it usually looks this enormous , elaborate pile of steel rises to 114.5 metres ( 376ft ) in what is now officially known as the @entity19			1
famously and strikingly red , it has announced that it will swap its ruddy hue for a celebratory coat of gold if @entity22 make it to the @entity32 on 13 july – and end up lifting the fabled trophy			2
some might say that this is a promise akin to a parent telling their child that they can go to @entity39 if they come top of the class in every single one of their summer exams ( including maths ) , then win every race at school sports day ( including the 1500 metres )			0
after years of hype and over-expectation , levels of belief in @entity22 ’s football team are generally low , and many would deem it a success if @entity55 ’s men were to emerge from a group stage where they face @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 – let alone go on to eclipse the likes of @entity3 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 to win the entire tournament			1
but there is no doubt that the @entity17 would look very fetching in gold – as the mock - up image above demonstrates			2
a very modern artwork : the sculpture was put in place as a striking companion piece to the @entity73 the move would echo the decision to honour @entity77 ’s many champions at the @entity78 , which saw post-boxes in gold medallists ’ home towns given the @entity82			0
the @entity17 was created by artist sir @entity83 and designer @entity84 , designed to be a landmark structure to stand next to the @entity73			0
like much of the rest of the @entity19 , the sculpture was closed off after the games as the space around the stadium was transformed for public use			0
the sculpture and the park reopened at the beginning of april , offering a two - tier observation deck with views that stretch across the capital – encompassing football sites such as @entity99 in the distance , and @entity101 ’s @entity90 nearer at hand			0
the @entity17 will further embrace the spirit of the @entity2 with screenings of all @entity22 fixtures at the @entity106 at its base			1
tickets for the observation decks are £ 15 for adults , £ 7 for kids ( arcelormittalorbit.com ) .			0
