' ruins capture the viewer ’s imagination with their ability to tell stories			0
they are a window into human histories , silent rooms with dust covered furniture , discarded objects that are left behind and a smell of mustiness lingering in the air echoing a past long gone			0

their presence can still be felt			0

a swathe of prefab homes were built to house those whose homes were destroyed after the @entity128 packed up : this suitcase was found in a forlorn cottage on the side of the busy @entity132 towards @entity133 in the village of @entity135			2
a luggage tag still attached to it reads ' @entity137 ' @entity18 said he uses ordinance survey maps , and an ancient @entity139 , the @entity141 equivalent of the @entity142 , in order to track down the long forgotten sites			1
he added : ' checking out the auction pages in local newspapers is useful and ' @entity148 ' websites also come in handy			0
