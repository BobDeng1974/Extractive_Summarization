@entity7 woke to the sound of her cat hissing and found the snake *coiled* around her baby daughter 's arm
as she tried to prise it off the serpent bit the infant three times in the hand - however the bites were not venomous
snake catcher says the *animal* was not trying to harm the child , but merely find a place to warm itself up
