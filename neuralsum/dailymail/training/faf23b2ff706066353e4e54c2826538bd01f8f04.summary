by @entity0 published : 20:12 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 20:12 est , 25 november 2013 lord @entity1 said the present system of 43 forces in @entity4 and @entity5 ' creates unnecessary duplication ' a number of police forces should be merged because the present national police structure is inefficient and ‘ untenable ’ , a former @entity8 chief said yesterday			1
lord @entity1 said the present system of 43 forces in @entity4 and @entity5 ‘ creates unnecessary duplication ’ and often gets in the way of joint ‘ cross border ’ operations by police			1
he outlined plans for a radical shake - up as he presented the findings of an independent review of the future of policing , commissioned by the @entity22			1
seven years ago @entity22 tried unsuccessfully - while in @entity23 - to streamline the number of forces in @entity4 and @entity5			1
but lord @entity1 , who headed the @entity26 for @entity22 , said the time was right to reconsider the idea as his inquiry team could find nobody in favour of retaining the current structure of 43 separate police force			1
he added , however , that there was no consensus about a better alternative			0
he said : ‘ @entity37 makes a clear recommendation that change is essential and believes there are three serious options			0
‘ these are locally - negotiated mergers and collaboration agreements , a co-ordinated amalgamation into approximately ten regional forces , or the creation of a national police service			2
’ in recognition of policing scandals including @entity50 and the @entity52 row involving former chief whip @entity53 , @entity1 also recommended a fundamental shake - up of professional standards in forces in @entity4 and @entity5			1
the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) and @entity58 ( @entity58 ) would be scrapped and replaced by a new @entity59 ( @entity59 ) , he said			0
his report - much of which will feature in @entity22 ’s next general election manifesto - also recommended a new status of ‘ chartered police officer ’ , in addition to the office of constable			1
the reform would bring the police into line with other professions such as nursing and accountancy , with officers registered with the @entity74 which could strike them off for failing to meet professional standards			0
the @entity74 would decide misconduct hearings in public , unlike the current , behind - closed doors , disciplinary process			0
lord @entity1 outlined plans for a radical shake - up of policing as he presented the findings of an independent review of the future of policing , commissioned by the @entity22 the @entity1 report said : ' the presumption should be for total transparency - with open , public hearings for decisions on serious misconduct - rather than the muddled regime of partially open hearings and judgments which currently prevails			1
' police officers found to have committed serious misconduct by the @entity100 should be struck off from the register			0
' @entity1 - who was @entity102 chief between 2000 and 2005 - said there were 37 ' radical ' recommendations in his report , including a commitment to neighbourhood policing as the ' building block of fair and effective policing '			1
his report , billed as the most comprehensive inquiry into policing for half a century , said : ' a spate of organisational failures and scandals over recent years has badly damaged public confidence in the integrity of the police			2
‘ it is vital this situation is put right			0
recent experience has found wanting the existing system which separates the monitoring of organisational performance from the investigation of police complaints			2
’ @entity126 said she expects her party to implement majority of the commission 's recommendations the @entity1 report also said the elected police and crime commissioner model is ' systemically flawed as a method of democratic governance ’ and should be scrapped in 2016 , at the end of the term of office of the 41 serving @entity138			1
shadow home secretary @entity126 , who was at the launch of the report with @entity22 leader @entity141 , said she expects her party to implement majority of the commission ’s recommendations for policing reform			2
she ruled out a national police force , saying : ' our preference is for a voluntary and collaborative approach involving local communities and we also want more work done on savings that can be made to plough back into policing			2
' we will not support a national force as we believe that would be too large , too centralised and the wrong approach			0
' the last police mergers plan followed a report published by @entity58 in 2005 which highlighted ‘ significant weaknesses ’ in the 43 force structure			0
the report said larger amalgamated police forces would be better suited to tackling the modern threats of organised crime and terrorism			0
but amid huge embarrassment for the @entity23 , the plan proved deeply unpopular amongst police chiefs and fell apart the following year .			0
