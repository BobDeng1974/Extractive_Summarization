@entity0 , the elephant who wept after being released from chains is facing more misery - after his owners have launched a legal battle to win him back			1
the creature captured the hearts of people from around the world when he cried as he was freed from chains after 50 years , and was taken to join five female elephants at @entity15 's @entity14 and @entity16 in @entity17			1
but now his former owners have launched a legal bid to reclaim him - insisting he is their ' rightful property '			2
his owner is arguing that @entity0 is his property , which must be returned to him for his use			1
' we are hoping the courts will see sense that this can never happen as @entity0 was treated with such appalling cruelty and torture in his hands in the first place and the man claiming ownership of @entity0 has no legal grounds to claim him back under @entity17 law			1
' the thought of him being forced to go back to a life in chains is just horrific			1
' we are starting a @entity0 legal fund that will help us fight such legal battles to protect @entity0 and elephants like him that suffer in silence			2
one of @entity0 ’s friends @entity53 who was rescued by @entity15 from @entity54 suffers a similar fate where her previous owner is claiming her back as property			1
' the creature captured the hearts of people from around the world when he cried as he was freed from chains after 50 years @entity0 's fate will be decided at a court hearing in @entity66 , on september 4 @entity0 's fate will be decided at a court hearing in @entity66 , on september 4			1
mr @entity27 added : ' we are planning to fight tooth and nail through the courts to ensure this ca n’t happen			0
we will take it to the highest legal levels and to the @entity75 if required			0
' we will argue that he broke wildlife protection laws and animal cruelty laws through his treatment of @entity0 , and that he was being kept illegally after being trafficked from handler to handler from being poached as a calf			2
' we want this case to set a precedent across @entity17 to change the way elephants are treated and abusers are punished and justice prevails for these magnificent creatures that suffer in silence			0
' @entity0 ’s story first came to light in july this year when the @entity92 - based charity @entity15 - @entity93 along with their counterparts , @entity95 , rescued him in a daring midnight operation in @entity17			2
a ten - strong team of vets and wildlife experts from the charity @entity15 along with 20 @entity102 and @entity103 officers seized @entity0 in the @entity105 region			2
@entity27 said : ' he 'd been poached as a calf from the wild ; poachers either slaughter the mother , or they drive the herd into traps that are small enough only for the babies to fall into			0
the mother cries for her baby for days after he 's been stolen – the illegal elephant trade is sickening			2
the calves are then tied and beaten until they submit to their captors – their spirits are effectively broken			0
' @entity0 's case was particularly tragic as we believe he has been sold again and again and might have had 27 owners – he 's been treated as a commodity and beaten into accepting his new handler every two years of his life			1
' by the time we found him he was in a pathetic condition			0
he had n't been fed properly and tourists started giving him sweet food items and because he was in a state of hunger and exhaustion he began eating plastic and paper he had no shelter at night , and was being used as a prop to beg with from dawn until dusk or being used for giving tourists joy rides			2
and most heartrendingly of all – the chains that cut into his legs had been there for 50 years			1
' it took us 45 minutes to remove the shackles that had torn into the flesh on his legs for the past 50 years – an act of unthinkable cruelty			1
@entity0 's story first came to light in july this year when the @entity92 - based charity @entity15 - @entity93 along with their counterparts , @entity95 , rescued him in a daring midnight operation in @entity17 ' his legs were so covered in abscesses and his feet so damaged by walking on hard tarmac roads , that we have spent much more than expected on his medical treatment , and we still have a long way to go as he has a serious limp and open wounds			1
' @entity0 arrived at @entity15 ’s @entity162 , in @entity163 , @entity17 , two months ago , where he joined five female elephants			2
mr @entity27 said : ' we are delighted @entity0 has fitted in so well with the first family he 's ever had since he was orphaned by poachers as a calf			1
the creature captured the hearts of people from around the world when he cried as he was freed from chains after 50 years @entity0 still faces years of treatment to heal both the physical and psychological wounds from his time in chains ' he had been so terribly brutalized for 50 years that we feared he ’d be unable to live with his own kind			1
he did n’t even know how to be an elephant			0
but now it ’s like he ’s always been with them			0
when we first released him , he held back and he was clearly wary			0
three of our female elephants @entity53 , @entity182 and @entity183 ( also known as @entity184 ) ran up to him – their ears flapping wildly – a sign they were excited and delighted to meet him			0
they also made high - pitched trumpeting sounds – a greeting			0
then each of them touched him with their trunks , clearly reassuring him before they wandered off into the grazing land			0
it was incredibly touching after all he ’d been through			0
' @entity0 still faces years of treatment to heal both the physical and psychological wounds			1
' the thought that he may have to leave all this behind if his owner gets his way – is absolutely heartbreaking for us and for the other elephants			0
' all we want is for him to taste freedom for the first time in their lives and live out his days in dignity , free from suffering and pain and we are determined to make that happen			0

the creature captured the hearts of people from around the world when he cried as he was freed from chains after 50 years
now his former owners , who used him to beg , are trying to get him back
@entity0 's fate will be decided at a court hearing in @entity66 , on september 4
