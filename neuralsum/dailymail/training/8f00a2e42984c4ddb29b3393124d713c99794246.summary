booked : @entity44 , @entity40 referee : @entity56 @entity5 created four clear chances in the final eight minutes but some poor finishing cost them and allowed @entity60 's men to move up to third spot in the @entity17			1
with @entity62 rested , @entity19 came into the @entity4 team for the first time since being injured in an alleged assault in @entity66 last month			2
the @entity67 was tested within 90 seconds when midfielder @entity46 made space to shoot from 25 yards and the goalkeeper held at the second attempt			0
@entity5 manager @entity71 dropped striker @entity72 to the bench and brought in defender @entity40 , who took @entity46 's normal role at left - back			1
@entity47 played up front for @entity5 but he was largely isolated in the opening half as a five - man midfield played close to a back four			2
@entity4 got behind the mass of blue shirts early on when @entity28 cut the ball back for @entity1 but the @entity7 sent a first - time effort over the bar			1
@entity26 had a shot deflected wide after @entity46 had given the ball away in a dangerous area but @entity5 were looking comfortable			2

@entity46 fired over from 22 yards after good play from @entity95 just before the break			0
@entity4 's @entity93 and @entity5 's @entity47 battle for the ball @entity4 manager @entity60 during the @entity17 match at @entity18 @entity4 's @entity9 ( right ) goes down trying to get to the ball during the first half @entity4 's @entity29 and @entity5 's @entity38 ( right ) vie for the ball the game exploded into life when @entity9 won the ball midway inside the @entity5 half before giving the ball to send @entity29 on the charge			1
@entity5 were suddenly exposed and , although @entity29 under - hit his pass to @entity1 , the @entity7 managed to work enough space to fire past two defenders and beat @entity37 with the power of his strike			1
however , the visitors were furious with referee @entity56 for missing what they claimed was a pull on the shirt of @entity48 by @entity9 when he won possession			0
@entity47 was booked for protesting and the controversy continued moments later when @entity1 had two penalty appeals rejected in quick succession			2
the on - loan @entity120 forward claimed handball when his shot was blocked as several visiting players dived at his feet and then appeared to be bundled over by @entity40 , but a free - kick was given against him after he fell on the ball			0

@entity1 scores the opener for @entity4 in the early stages of the second half and the forward celebrates his goal in somewhat emphatic fashion on the @entity18 turf the visitors had a good chance to level when @entity46 fed @entity48 but the left - winger fired over from 15 yards			1
@entity26 and @entity40 received yellow cards for late tackles as the game remained tetchy			0
it was also far more open with @entity5 bringing on @entity145 , @entity45 and @entity72 in the hunt for an equaliser and consequently leaving more gaps at the back			0
@entity46 shot wide with the aid of a deflection from a decent position before @entity23 missed a good chance at the other end			0
and @entity5 put @entity4 under intense late pressure			1
@entity42 blazed over from 16 yards after @entity45 's shot was blocked and @entity40 nodded over after @entity157 had headed a corner into the six - yard box			0
@entity38 set up another opportunity in injury - time but @entity72 could not get enough on the ball from six yards and @entity19 pounced to smother , before the @entity67 saved @entity40 's downward header and scrambled the bouncing ball over the bar .			0
