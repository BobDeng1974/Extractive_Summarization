having started at the top of the diamond , @entity0 finished the game on the left wing			1
in truth , his contributions were limited in both positions but the tactical switch brought the consolation of a quick exit			2
@entity11 was well placed to dart straight down the tunnel , with a dark look on his face which failed to reflect the relief that @entity16 had rescued a late point from a game they seemed set to lose			1
he was almost off the pitch when he twisted his upper body towards the @entity16 fans in a distant corner of the ground and offered them some over-the - shoulder applause , but he did not allow the after - thought to interrupt his stride			2
@entity0 ( left ) struggled to make an impact as @entity16 nicked a draw at @entity28 @entity11 had a difficult afternoon , and not a lot went right for the @entity31 playmaker @entity34 football ’s most expensive signing could not get off fast enough			1
mind you , he was n’t alone			0
only @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 took the trouble to trudge over to the supporters			1
again , not a lot had gone right for @entity11 during 90 minutes best summed up by one moment , 13 minutes into the second half when @entity38 , searching for a long pass to the @entity16 right , crashed the ball into the £ 60million @entity31 , who was just a yard or two away			1
it was not @entity50 ’s most stylish offering and he shrugged an apology as he digested the contents of a filthy glare from @entity54 , who could have done without another pain in the backside			0
it had not been a good few days			0
perhaps the horror of the robbery at his home was still playing tricks on his mind			0
it has not been a great first campaign in @entity34 football			0
eight months have ticked by since he was the man of the match in @entity70 ’s @entity69 final success			2
@entity71 played a diamond formation against @entity28 , but some players struggled with the style @entity75 proved to be ineffective , and squandered a chance to get on the scoresheet at @entity78 he has not played in the competition since , and might start to wonder if he will be back in it next season			1
@entity16 are fighting in the pack behind @entity83 and @entity84			0
it is going to be close if they continue to follow each sign of progress with a backward step			0
@entity11 is finding it difficult to influence games as he did when he first arrived from @entity70			1
it is four months since his last goal in the @entity94 , although he got one at @entity96 in the @entity97			1
at @entity28 , flashes of promise were swallowed up by the peculiarities of @entity71 ’s system , seemingly designed to cram as many creative players as possible into the team , but rarely in their preferred positions			1
they lacked pace , width and aggression and were easily neutralised by the midfield endeavour of @entity110 and the defensive strength of @entity112 and @entity113			0
@entity75 ( right ) knocks the ball past @entity115 in the @entity28 goal , but it goes wide of the post @entity11 ( left ) makes a pass under pressure from @entity28 midfielder @entity120 at @entity78 on sunday @entity11 ’s most significant offerings were a fierce drive into the arms of @entity115 in the first half , and a free - kick whipped over the bar in the second			1
in open play , he struggled in a side where the attackers are playing without fluency			0
while @entity133 made saves and @entity39 defended well , no one dazzled in @entity138 ’s front five until the introduction of @entity137 added some useful muscle			0
@entity75 and @entity139 were both guilty of missing clear chances as @entity16 searched for the equaliser			0
like @entity11 , @entity142 and @entity36 seemed lost on the edges of the diamond			1
@entity36 operated in areas of the pitch where he had little positive impact on proceedings , having defended poorly on @entity113 ’s opener			2
@entity36 memorably scored from halfway at @entity78 last season			2
this time @entity16 can cherish their point and little else by way of satisfaction .			0

@entity0 started at the top of @entity71 *'s* diamond formation
he finished the game on the left wing , and left the pitch in a *hurry*
not a lot went right for the @entity31 , summed up in the second half when @entity38 crashed the ball into him from a yard or two away
@entity11 seemed lost , and has not scored a league goal in four months
