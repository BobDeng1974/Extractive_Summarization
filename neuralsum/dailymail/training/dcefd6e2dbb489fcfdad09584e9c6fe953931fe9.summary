a @entity1 team of engineers has developed an artificial tree that can generate electricity using the wind			2
' the idea came to me in a square where i saw the leaves tremble when there was not a breath of air , ' said @entity13 , the founder of the @entity15 start - up which will market the @entity16 in 2015			2
he added the energy ' had to come from somewhere and be translatable into watts '			0
it uses tiny blades housed in the ' leaves ' that turn in the wind - regardless of its direction - and has the added advantage of being completely silent			1
he hopes they can eventually be used in people 's own homes and in urban centres			1
the tree , which will sell for £ 23,500 , can reportedly generate electricity on twice the number of days as a conventional wind turbine because it can generate power on winds of just 4.5mph			2
mr @entity54 said the tree - which has not yet been tested by an independent laboratory - is profitable after winds of 7.8mph on average over one year			0
' the idea came to me in a square where i saw the leaves tremble when there was not a breath of air , ' said @entity13 , the founder of the @entity15 start - up which will market the @entity16 in 2015 he hopes the tree can be used to exploit small ' deposits ' of air currents flowing into town along the buildings and streets to feed , for example , @entity76 street lamps , or a charging station for electrical cars			1
he admits there are more consistent winds 160ft in the air but they require ' monstrous machines ' , far from where energy is consumed , he added			0
he hopes the tree can be combined with other means of power generation such as photovoltaic , and geothermal , combined with energy - efficient buildings			0
in the future mr @entity13 hopes to develop a ' perfect tree that has leaves with natural fibres , roots that could generate geothermal energy and ' bark ' covered with photosensitive cells			0
however , @entity98 an engineering expert at the @entity100 ( @entity101 ) , says the potential of small wind turbines in the city remains ' quite low ' .			1

the ' @entity16 ' uses tiny blades housed in the ' leaves ' that turn in breezes
developers hope they can be used in people 's homes and city centres
they *claim* the tree is less *obtrusive* and more *viable* than wind turbines
