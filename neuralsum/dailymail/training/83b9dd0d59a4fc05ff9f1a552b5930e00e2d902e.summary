by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 will protect his young players from burnout even if it means gambling with @entity8 ’s ambitions at the @entity9 on friday afternoon			1
@entity8 ’s @entity10 need a point from their final @entity13 game against @entity14 to qualify for sunday ’s third - fourth place play - off , but @entity2 will make at least seven changes to the side that drew 1 - 1 with @entity18 on wednesday			1
the past 11 days for this squad have been taxing , given they also faced a @entity22 qualifier against @entity23 , and though no @entity25 or @entity26 clubs have spoken to the @entity27 , @entity2 is conscious of the workload			1
cautious : @entity2 will protect his young players from burnout at the @entity9 tournament @entity32 of @entity33 , @entity35 midfielder @entity34 and @entity37 winger @entity36 will be given a break and head coach @entity2 is happy to take responsibility if eliminated			1
‘ we do n’t want to pick up any unnecessary injuries , so we ’ve got to respect the clubs and the welfare of our players , ’ he said			2
‘ the only difficulty of the tournament is that there ’s just one day between games			2
it is impossible for the lads who have played three games to play again			0
if i was a club manager and saw my player playing three games in five days , i could understandably say we were negligent if they suffered an injury			0
‘ we will have to make seven changes			0
if we get through , we ’d do the same again			0
but we could n’t ask @entity32 and @entity34 to play ( against @entity14 )			2
to do that would be asking for trouble			0
we ’ve got to trust the rest of the group to get the result we need			0
’ a game against either @entity64 or @entity65 in @entity66 on sunday would be beneficial with @entity22 in mind , and @entity2 added : ‘ the chance to play better sides is even more important			1
these boys have been taken out of their comfort zones and benefited for it			0
’ double trouble : @entity74 gets away from two @entity76 players during @entity8 's 1 - 1 on wednesday @entity8 ( probable line - up , 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , march , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87			1
