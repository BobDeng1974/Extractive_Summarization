officials @entity1 was just looking for a warm place to sleep on a frigid night last month when he curled up in an enclosed stairwell on the roof of a @entity6 apartment building where he was arrested for trespassing			1
a week later , the mentally ill homeless man was found dead in a @entity11 jail cell that four city officials say had overheated to at least 100 degrees , apparently because of malfunctioning equipment			1
the officials told @entity15 that the 56 - year - old former @entity16 was on anti-psychotic and anti-seizure medication , which may have made him more vulnerable to heat			1
he also apparently did not open a small vent in his cell , as other inmates did , to let in cool air			1
@entity26 and her daughter @entity27 hold a photo of @entity1 's son , @entity1 , 56 , a mentally ill , homeless former @entity16 who died in a @entity11 jail cell that was at least 100 degrees ' he basically baked to death , ' said one of the officials , who all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to discuss specifics of the case			1
the medical examiner 's office said an autopsy was inconclusive and that more tests were needed to determine @entity1 's exact cause of death			2
but the officials , all with detailed knowledge of the case , say initial indications from the autopsy and investigation point to extreme dehydration or heat stroke			2
advocates for mentally ill inmates in @entity57 say the death represents the failure of the city 's justice system on almost every level : by arresting @entity1 instead of finding him help , by setting bail at a prohibitive $ 2,500 and by not supervising him closely in what is supposed to be a special observation unit for inmates with mental illnesses			1
source of pride : a letter to @entity26 from the @entity16 announcing the promotion of her son @entity1 to the rank of private first class @entity77 spokesman @entity76 said in a statement that an internal investigation will look into all circumstances of @entity1 's death , ' including issues of staff performance and the adequacy of procedures			1
' @entity76 acknowledged that the temperature in @entity1 's cell was ' unusually high ' and that action has been taken to fix mechanical problems to ensure safe temperatures , ' particularly in areas housing vulnerable inmates			1
' @entity1 's 75 - year - old mother , @entity93 , said she did not learn of her son 's death until the @entity15 contacted her last week , nearly a month after he died			1
his public defender was told of the death three days after the inmate was found , the @entity77 said			2
' he was a very lovely , caring guy , ' said @entity1 , adding that her son had bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and that she had not seen him in about three years			2
' he had beer problems			0
other than that , he was a very nice guy			0
he 'd give you the shirt off his back			0
' grieving mother : @entity93 's son was arrested last month for sleeping in the roof landing of a @entity57 public housing project during one of the coldest recorded winters in city history family members say @entity1 grew up in @entity119 and joined the @entity16 right out of high school , doing at least one stint in @entity122 , @entity123			1
when he returned from the service , his family said , both his mental illness and thirst for alcohol became more pronounced , and he would often disappear for months at a time , finding warmth in hospitals , shelters and the streets			0
' when he wanted to venture off , we let him , we allowed him to come and go , ' recalled his sister , @entity27			0
' he always came back			0
' @entity1 's criminal record included 11 misdemeanor convictions for trespassing , drinking in public and minor drug charges , said @entity139 , a public defender who represented him at his arraignment on the trespassing charge			1
according to the city officials , @entity1 was locked alone into his 6 - by - 10 cinderblock cell at about 10.30pm february 14 , a week after his arrest			1
because he was in the mental - observation unit , he was supposed to be checked every 15 minutes as part of suicide watch , they said			0
but @entity1 was not discovered until four hours later , at about 2.30am february 15			1
he was slumped over in his bed and already dead			0
warrior : @entity1 grew up in @entity119 and joined the @entity16 out of high school , doing at least one tour of duty in @entity122 , @entity123 when @entity1 was found and his cell opened , his internal body temperature and the temperature in the cell were at least 100 degrees			1
those temperatures could have been higher before he was discovered because the cell had been closed for several hours , the officials said			2
dr. @entity160 , an associate professor at @entity161 and a national expert on heat - related deaths who monitors heat conditions at @entity11 , said psychotropic medications can impair the body 's ability to cool itself by sweating , making it retain more heat than it should			1
exposure to intense heat for a couple of hours by someone on such medications could be fatal , she said			2
last year , only three @entity11 inmates died from non-natural causes , according to @entity77 statistics			0
of the 12,000 inmates who make up the nation 's second - largest jail system , about 40 per cent are mentally ill , and a third of them suffer from serious mental problems the department said			0
advocates and others have long argued that correction officers are not sufficiently trained to deal with mentally ill inmates whose needs are complex			0
downward spiral : after leaving the military , @entity1 started indulging in alcohol , and he would often disappear for months at a time @entity192 , a member of the @entity193 , an agency charged with overseeing the city 's jails , suggested at a recent public meeting that @entity1 should have been referred him to psychiatric care , not to @entity11			1
@entity199 , an attorney at the @entity57 - based @entity201 's @entity200 , said @entity1 appeared to be a man in need of care			2
' so mr. @entity1 violated the trespass law			0
so he suffered the consequences by going to jail , ' @entity206 said			0
' but the jail system committed more serious harm to him			0
and the question is , " will they ever be held responsible ? " ' @entity213 , another of @entity1 's sisters , said the family wants an explanation			2
' we want justice for what was done , ' she said			0
' he was n't just some old homeless person on the street			0

@entity1 , 56 , had internal body temperature of at least 100 degrees when he was found dead in a cell in @entity11 february 15
@entity1 was arrested a week earlier for trespassing for sleeping in internal stairwell on the roof of a @entity6 apartment complex
city officials said inmate 's anti-psychotic medications made him more *sensitive* to heat , and he also failed to open a vent in his cell
