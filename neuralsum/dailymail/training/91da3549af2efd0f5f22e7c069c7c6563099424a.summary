unknown : the ritually slaughtered meat could be present the non-jewish market as well beef and lamb from animals killed in ‘ cruel ’ ritual ceremonies are being sold in mainstream butchers , restaurants and supermarkets across @entity9 , @entity10 has found			1
our investigation has discovered that kosher meat – which is slaughtered in accordance with strict jewish food preparation rules – is being sold as ordinary fresh beef and lamb , or ending up in ready - made meals and burgers			1
the @entity21 ‘ shechita ’ method of slaughter – the practice of slitting an animal ’s throat and allowing it to bleed to death – has been slammed as ‘ inhumane ’ by vets and animal rights groups because the creature is conscious when it happens			1
@entity21 law governing shechita strictly forbids pre-stunning , as do some @entity35 groups for the production of halal meat			1
however , recent research suggests that unstunned animals can feel pain for up to two minutes			0
in conventional methods of slaughter , animals are rendered unconscious with an electric shock before their throats are slit or they are shot			2
jews who observe strict kosher rules also eat only the front part of a cow or sheep because the rump and hind - quarters are deemed ‘ unholy ’			2
but the @entity53 can reveal that a number of abattoirs in the @entity9 and @entity56 that practise shechita are selling these ‘ unholy ’ parts to @entity9 suppliers and retailers , including supermarkets and butchers			2
as a result , many consumers are buying their meat unaware of how it was produced			0
although the number of animals killed in the @entity9 under shechita rules is not known , @entity67 , which campaigns for humane slaughter methods , claims 1.4 million sheep and goats , 32 million chickens and 70,000 cattle are slaughtered for meat without being stunned first			1
experts say meat from an equal number of animals killed by similar methods in @entity56 finds its way into the @entity9 , one the biggest markets for @entity56 abattoirs and suppliers			1
' unholy ' : the parts marked with an ' x ' are potentially making their way into the food chain @entity90 , international sales director of @entity91 in @entity92 – one of @entity56 ’s biggest abattoirs – said all leftovers from its shechita slaughter is sold to mainstream suppliers in both @entity56 and the @entity9			1
the firm kills about 600 cows a week using the un-stunned method , mainly for the @entity21 market			1
@entity102 , managing director of @entity103 , in @entity104 , @entity105 , also admitted that left - over kosher meat ends up in the main food chain			1
he said : ‘ what if we are doing kosher meat ? it ’s been legalised by the government			0
it ’s fit to go into the food chain , and we pass it on to lots of outlets			2
if animals cost £ 1,200 to £ 1,400 a piece , providing it ’s fit for human consumption , it ’s all got to be sold somewhere			2
preparation : animals are usually stunned before being killed for their meat , but @entity21 law forbids this ‘ i ca n’t afford to throw away half of the beast , so it gets sold into the food chain			1
i have a business to run here			0
’ @entity132 , a technical and legal adviser at the @entity133 , said : ‘ the shechita meat is ending up in the entire @entity136 market , without any kind of labelling			2
' i know the names of the meat suppliers and even the supermarkets that are selling the meat , but i ca n’t tell you that because of commercial sensitivity			0
’ earlier this month , @entity145 , chief of the @entity146 , was accused of stoking up anti-semitism and @entity148 after claiming the religious slaughter of animals without stunning should be banned because it is cruel			0
but @entity152 @entity9 , which regulates religious slaughter for the @entity21 community , insisted that when trained slaughtermen carry out shechita , the animals feel little pain			1
spokesman @entity159 said : ‘ we too advocate better labelling , but a more comprehensive one			0
' rather than saying just “ stunned , ” it should say “ electrocuted ” , “ gassed ” or “ shot with a bolt gun ”			0
then consumers will be fully informed			0
’ celebrity chef @entity165 also called for clearer labelling			0
‘ people have a right to know what they are eating , ’ he said			0
‘ i am going to ask my own suppliers next week if any unstunned meat comes into my own restaurants			0

according to @entity21 law , animals can not be stunned during slaughter
vets and animal rights groups have *attacked* the ' inhumane ' practice
mail on *sunday* finds meat butchered for @entity21 market is being sold on
it then ends in the regular food chain *alongside* normally - slaughtered meat
since *publication* of this *article* , @entity152 @entity9 has asked us to point out that the number of animals slaughtered in the @entity9 each year by shechita is as follows : *poultry* 1 million , cattle *20,000* , sheep *60,000* .
