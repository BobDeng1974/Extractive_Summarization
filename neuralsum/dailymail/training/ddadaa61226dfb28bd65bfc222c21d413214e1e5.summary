by @entity1 reporter published : 02:53 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 02:16 est , 14 august 2012 there were more than a few raised eyebrows at the @entity6 closing ceremony last night - and not solely thanks to @entity8 's dance moves			0
onlookers in the 70,000 - strong audience at the @entity11 were baffled by the inclusion of @entity14 's high end designer label in a fashion hall of fame that featured in the lavish show			1
the @entity18 's fledgling brand took its place on the list of showcased designers with @entity22 and @entity23			1
shoe - in : @entity25 wore a gold fit - and - flare @entity14 design on stage during the closing ceremony of the @entity6 last night @entity25 ( second from right ) in @entity14 's design took her place alongside fellow models , from left , @entity34 , @entity35 ( back row ) , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 mrs @entity14 – who only launched her fashion range in 2007 - was included on a supposedly selective roll call of the finest fashion designers the country has ever produced			1
only nine of the very best – namely @entity23 , @entity22 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 - were featured			2
with her fashions only a few years old – and receiving lukewarm reviews among some critics – observers will question whether her presence on the list is little more than a giant advert			0
there was a supermodel for each great @entity64 fashion designer featured in the fashion segment , with @entity25 modelling @entity67 ’s wares			2
giant advert ? onlookers were baffled to see @entity14 's fledgling label included in a showcase of @entity64 's most legendary designers ms @entity14 designed the bespoke fit - and - flare piece in gold gazar especially for yesterday evening 's event , saying in a recent interview that when she created it , she was thinking of ' the ideas of high performance - in terms of quality , fit , fabric and stitching , ' and adding that she revisited one of her signature designs			1
eleven cutters and designers are reported to help mrs @entity14 to design the clothes lines that bear her name			2
and the results have received mixed reviews in the fashion world			0
there have been accusations that the designs are seriously overpriced , with dresses in her mainline brand costing around £ 1,650 each , and a pair of leather leggings bearing her name once priced at £ 1,250			0
one of her lines - entitled , ‘ @entity14 , @entity14 ’ – was recently marketed as being affordable and good value for money			0
but the marketing caused ridicule when it emerged that a sleeveless wool shift dress cost £ 500 while a long - sleeved day dress cost £ 750			1
she has also been criticised for marketing herself as a ‘ @entity64 ’ designer while having her clothes made overseas in @entity111 and @entity112 , instead of in @entity64 .			0
