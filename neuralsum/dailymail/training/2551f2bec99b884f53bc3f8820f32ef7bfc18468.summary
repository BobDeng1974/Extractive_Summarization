by @entity0 a @entity2 woman has started transporting her two - foot tall miniature horse in the boot of her @entity5 after finding it impossible to safely secure him in a horse box			1
@entity9 , 23 , said she had been stopped by police several times while driving in her hometown of @entity13 in @entity14 , but has always been able to prove that four - year - old @entity15 - who is about as tall as a medium - sized dog - is properly secured			1
the @entity18 student said she was forced to adopt unorthodox methods to transport the @entity20 after realising he was far safer in the boot of her car than in a full - sized horse box , where he is too small to be suitably fastened			1
taken for a ride : @entity15 - a four - year - old @entity20 - has to travel in the boot of his owner 's @entity5 because he is too small to travel in a normal - sized horse box unusual : @entity15 's owner @entity9 ( pictured in white ) said she was forced to adopt unorthodox methods to transport him after realising he was far safer in the boot of her car than in a horse box cute : the four - year - old stallion is an @entity34 @entity20 - one of the smallest breeds of horse in the world ms @entity9 contacted local media to explain her reasons for transporting @entity15 in the back of her black @entity5 after photographs started appearing in national media			1
she felt she needed to explain that not only was @entity15 traveling in the boot for his own safety , it was also a perfectly legal way of transporting an animal of his size			0
' i have actually been stopped several times by the police , but once they see that @entity15 is properly secured in the back of the car and in fact that he seems to be quite enjoying it in there , they always let me carry on , ' ms @entity9 said			1
' in the horse box it is not possible to properly secure him because he is so small , and he only has a white wall to look at which is nowhere near as interesting as having a window in the car , ' she added			1
entertainer : two - foot tall @entity15 now routinely travels in the back of a smart car whenever he needs to travel to perform in a show or an event strapped in : @entity9 said she had been stopped by police several times while driving in her hometown of @entity13 in @entity14 , but has always been able to prove that @entity15 is properly secured adorable : ms @entity9 adopted @entity15 two years ago after seeing him advertised on the internet bad fit : ms @entity9 started transporting her two - foot tall miniature horse in the boot of her @entity5 after realising he was too small secure properly in a normal horse box			1
it also allows him to look out the window ms @entity9 said @entity15 now routinely travels in the back of her @entity5 whenever he needs to travel to perform in a show or an event			2
' it is particularly practical for short journeys just to put him in the boot , ' she said			0
ms @entity9 adopted @entity15 two years ago after seeing him advertised on the internet			2
he had been badly treated and underfed by a previous owner and required a lot of extra care and attention to become calm enough to perform at local horse shows			0
the four - year - old stallion is an @entity34 @entity20 - one of the smallest breeds of horse in the world			0
for the record : @entity9 contacted local media to explain her reasons for transporting @entity15 in the back of her black @entity5 after photographs started appearing in national media loved : @entity15 had been badly treated and underfed by a previous owner and required a lot of extra care and attention to become calm enough to perform at local horse shows trot : despite the fact they seldom grow much taller than a medium - sized dog @entity110 are classed as horses , not ponies			2
because they are so small , they are not suitable for riding what a sight ! @entity9 felt she needed to explain that not only was @entity15 traveling in the boot for his own safety , it was also a perfectly legal way of transporting an animal of his size despite the fact they seldom grow much taller than a medium - sized dog @entity125 are horses , not ponies			2
although the difference between the two is usually based on height , the actual definition is in fact based on phenotypes - the physical characteristics and temperament of the animal			0
in short , despite being smaller than many ponies , the character and physicality of an @entity20 has far more in common with a horse , and they are therefore defined as such			0
because they are so small , @entity34 @entity125 are not suitable for riding			0
they are , however , highly intelligent and are occasionally used as an alternative to a guide dog for blind people .			0

@entity20 ' @entity15 ' is too small to travel in a normal horse box
owner @entity9 , 23 , instead transports him in the boot of her smart car
student from @entity13 , @entity2 says police *regularly* pull her over
but she has always been able to prove that @entity15 is happy and secure
