@entity7 , 71 , bought the abandoned black - and - white timber - framed home in @entity9 , @entity10 , for just £ 300 in 1968 after discovering it was about to be demolished			1
she has spent the last 46 years restoring it ms @entity7 pictured at the property in the early 1970s , towards the start of the lengthy renovation process ms @entity7 ( pictured today ) said she has spent £ 20,000 transforming the property , which she will now sell despite spending most weekends and holidays scouring skips and breakers yards for beams and fixtures to use in the house , she has never spent a night in the property			1
ms @entity7 , a retired library clerk , lived in a house three doors down from the ruined house , and now hopes it will be bought by a family			1
she has spent an estimated £ 20,000 doing the work and finally completed it earlier this summer			1
the grandmother - of - three said : ' no - one wanted the property as it was about to have a demolition order slapped on it by the @entity9 borough surveyors			1
it was in a really bad state			2
' we live very close by and we just fell in love with the house			1
' we did n't want it to be knocked down so just went for it when we realised no - one else was going to step in and buy it			1
we bought it purely out of self - interest			1
nobody else would have been stupid enough to buy it			2
' we took the building to the ground ourselves			2
it was daunting because we did not have a lot of money			2
the house , named @entity14 , was built in 1623 and had been set for demolition when bought by ms @entity7 she has scoured scrap yards and timber sites to find the specific beams and interior to refurbish the property despite spending decades restoring the house , ms @entity7 has never spent a night in the property and instead lives in a house on the same road			1
she said she took on the project with her late husband out of ' self - interest ' ' we had no idea how much property restoration cost - it must be around £ 20,000			1
' we put scaffolding up ourselves and over the pavement , which would not be allowed today			1
' we took it down and marked up all the timbers and detailed where they had come from			2
' in 1967 , the @entity88 was introduced and this awarded town scheme grants			0
this was crucial for us			0
' @entity9 was the first conservation town in @entity92 , and @entity93 was the first property awarded a grant of about £ 3,000			1
' that gave us hope			0
the county conservation team were very supportive			0
we were in the position then to employ a knowledgeable student architect			0
' the couple , who had three children , split up in the early 1990s and mr @entity103 died in his sixties several years ago - but she continued to restore the building			1
she added : ' we kept running out of money and we were poor most of our lives			0
' we had lots of help from skilled local craftsmen			0
for instance , we learned how to lay the traditional local tiles			0
' most modern tiles are nailed on , but if you drill old tiles they split and are lain on traditional lime mortar			0
' we even went through skips			0
we found timbers , pieces of sandstone , @entity121 panelling and piles of things we needed			0
' it is a bit of a wrench to sell it , considering i have never even spent one night in the property but i 'm immensely proud of what we did			1
ms @entity7 said : ' we bought it purely out of self - interest			1
nobody else would have been stupid enough to buy it ' the property was completed earlier this summer and has been put on the market this week for £ 200,000 ms @entity7 said she hopes a family will buy the property and said restoring it has been a ' remarkable journey ' the house was originally a general store selling pewter , iron supplies and food to people living in @entity9 ' the two estate agents who have looked at the property have both valued it at about £ 200,000 but said it was difficult to value			1
' they noted that is in the flood plain and is vulnerable to flooding , there is no garden and it is on the main road			0
it is not madly attractive			0
' but i have got to sell it now			0
all my savings are tied up in it			0
i probably need to go to a care home soon so i need to move out			2
i can not care for the building anymore			0
' having spent most of my life rebuilding it , i am not going to just sell it to someone who thinks it is quaint			2
' i am not walking around saying " i am proud of this and that "			0
it was just really interesting to do			0
' it enabled me to do , in that day in the 1960s , a lot of things women were unable to do			0
it has been an education			0
it is like some people spend time on rebuilding classic cars			0
money was not relevant , it was a remarkable journey			0
' the house was originally a general store selling pewter , iron supplies and food to people crossing the medieval bridge into @entity9			1
it was then turned into a pub before finally being converted into a private house when it fell into a state of disrepair at the beginning of the 20th century			1
ms @entity7 ( centre right ) , pictured in the early 1970s with joiner @entity198 ( left ) , architect @entity199 ( centre left ) , and her late husband @entity103 ( right ) , who all contributed over the years to the restoration ms @entity7 said : ' i have never even spent one night in the property but i 'm immensely proud of what we did ' she said estate agents have found it difficult to value the property because it is situated on a flood plain and there is lack of a garden ( above )			1
it is also on a main road			0
the grandmother added : ' it is not madly attractive ' ms @entity7 said : ' there were lots of reasons why the renovation project took so long to complete but mainly because it was the money			1
' we had three children to bring up and jobs to do and we also did n't want to rush into renovating the house			2
we wanted to take the time to do it right			0
' we spent a long time tracking down the exact materials we needed			2
for example , it took us a long time to track down the correct bullnose bricks for the wall which were unique to @entity9			1
' before the children were born myself and @entity13 spent hours driving around @entity9 in a @entity235 scouring scrap yards and building merchants			1
' at that time people did n't value historic buildings so usually they would strip out the original features of a house , the tiles and panelling and just dump it all			2
' we got quite skilled at finding out where demolitions were taking place and negotiated with the people who were taking the properties apart			0
' because we were doing most of the work ourselves , we got a lot of things wrong			0
' on one occasion we bought a large section of sandstone wall for the foundations but did n't realise that turns back to sand when it goes in the ground			2
' we both wanted the house to be renovated properly because otherwise there would have been no point doing it in the first place			2
