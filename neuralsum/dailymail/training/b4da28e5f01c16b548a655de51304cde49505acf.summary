by @entity0 published : 16:42 est , 7 july 2012 updated : 08:18 est , 8 july 2012 a children ’s author and illustrator has been awarded £ 250,000 in compensation seven years after botched laser eye surgery left her with blurred vision			1
@entity7 , 47 , who was shortlisted for a @entity8 for her book mr @entity10 , went to a private eye clinic to cure her short - sightedness but ended up permanently scarred			1
in 2007 , dr @entity14 , the ophthalmologist who carried out the routine operation , was found guilty of professional misconduct but mrs @entity7 had to spend a further five years fighting for compensation			1
' nearly destroyed her ' : children 's author @entity7 ( left ) has been awarded £ 250,000 in compensation after a botched laser eye operation by dr @entity14 ( right ) left her with blurred vision yesterday , she said she would return the money ‘ in an instant ’ if she could reverse years of suffering that ‘ nearly destroyed ’ her			1
mrs @entity7 , who had the procedure at the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , in april 2005 , said : ‘ the scarring on my eye is something i am aware of every waking hour of every day			1
every conscious moment , i am staring through a scar			2
i wish i could have just one day when i do n’t have to worry about my eyes			2
’ she added : ‘ i dread the winter months with the reduced daylight hours			2
whenever my eye is tired or particularly blurry , i wonder , “ is this it ? am i going blind ? ” ’ the @entity37 procedure is designed to permanently change the shape of the cornea – the clear covering at the front of the eye			2
to prepare the eye , very high pressures are applied via a suction ring			0
a cutting instrument is then used to make a flap in the cornea , before laser energy is applied to remove corneal tissue			0
mrs @entity7 told the @entity50 in 2007 that dr @entity14 , of @entity52 , @entity53 , ‘ fumbled ’ with the laser equipment before removing it from her eye			1
he then apologised and said that he could not continue			0
highly regarded : mrs @entity7 's book mr @entity58 's @entity10 was short - listed for a @entity8 mrs @entity7 told @entity60 that dr @entity14 denied anything was wrong when she questioned her impaired vision			1
‘ he knew full well i had irreversible scarring and that was the reason my vision was poor , but he chose to lie , ’ she said			0
the @entity50 ruled dr @entity14 ’s actions were ‘ inappropriate , unprofessional and not in mrs @entity7 ’s best interests ’			1
he had incorrectly tried to achieve suction on her left eye more than once , which resulted in a tear to her cornea			0
however , the @entity50 did not suspend his registration as a doctor after he agreed to training and supervision			2
mrs @entity7 had two operations to correct the damage but still has blurred vision and sees double lines when she reads			1
in a settlement with dr @entity14 ’s insurers , the author has now been awarded £ 250,000			1
mrs @entity7 said that the compensation represented five years ’ earnings and that it meant she no longer had to worry about losing her home			1
she continued : ‘ i would return it in an instant were i able to return to the day before my surgery was botched			0
creating picture books for children is my life			0
' when my eye was ruined , i was determined not to stop working , no matter how difficult and uncomfortable the injury made things			0
’ she explained that she had improvised by working at a much larger scale and experimenting with collage in her works			0
mrs @entity7 added : ‘ working this way also helped me to restore my shattered confidence , which was crucial because following the botched operation , every time i questioned my impaired vision , the surgeon told me that i was “ mistaken ” and that i was “ imagining it ”			1
‘ to have someone in a position of trust and power abuse that position in that way is despicable			0
it made me question the very things i was seeing , which is catastrophic for an illustrator			0
’ her lawyer , @entity121 , of @entity122 - ctts , added : ‘ mrs @entity7 felt incredibly let down by the way her complaint was handled			1
she felt ignored and abandoned			0
her only recourse was to bring a compensation claim			2
the amount fairly represents the significant effects of her injury on her life			0
however , it can never restore her damaged eyesight			0
’ dr @entity14 ’s solicitors declined to discuss the case			0
a spokesman for @entity27 said : ‘ we are aware that mrs @entity7 has been engaged in a civil action with mr @entity139 but as we were removed from legal proceedings in 2009 we do not have any detail upon which to provide further comment			1
‘ duty and quality of care will always remain our key priorities and we sincerely empathise with mrs @entity7 ’s situation			2
