by @entity0 follow @ @ kie1410 @entity1 : @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 @entity48 's youngsters got their @entity50 season off to a losing start after a red card , an own goal and a 92nd - minute strike from substitute @entity24 won @entity1 the match			1
@entity25 's @entity56 could do little to prevent the 2 - 1 defeat on friday night after @entity29 was sent off for two bookable offences , leaving @entity1 with 10 minutes to attack			1
@entity60 manager @entity59 will leave @entity62 sensing fortune was on his side , while @entity25 right - back @entity22 will return north feeling the opposite			1
a goal from @entity22 just two minutes in - his first at @entity67 level - got @entity25 en route to three points , only for the @entity70 to find his own net and gift @entity1 an equaliser 13 minutes from time			1
it was a melee in the box that allowed @entity22 to capitalise for his opener , before a tricky cross from @entity1 's @entity12 caused problems for the 17 - year - old who , in truth , did n't deserve such rotten luck			2
it got worse for @entity25 as , four minutes later , they were reduced to 10 men with @entity29 the culprit receiving two yellow cards			2
' it was a really tough game against a really strong , physical team			0
they caused us problems but the game was everything i expected it to be , ' he said			0
‘ it was nice for @entity24 to score because it was a difficult decision for me to leave him out			0
he ’s had an outstanding pre-season , scoring and creating goals , and he was unlucky to miss out tonight but he responded in the perfect way			0
’ @entity29 's first came in the 56th minute for holding back @entity12 , before he committed the same foul on @entity17 less than half an hour later to be sent for an early shower in the @entity62 changing rooms			2
@entity1 sensed the win was within reach , and their persistence paid off			0
@entity12 , a thorn in @entity25 's side all evening , burst down the right and a deflected cross fell kindly to substitute @entity24 , whose low shot found the bottom corner			1
it was too little , too late for @entity25 to muster a comeback , and the @entity50 season started with advantage @entity116 over @entity48			0
