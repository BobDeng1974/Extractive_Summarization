by @entity0 published : 10:59 est , 21 september 2012 updated : 14:09 est , 21 september 2012 titanic captain @entity1 failed his seafaring exams on the first attempt it emerged his sterling reputation meant some members of the upper class would voyage with no one else , but it has now emerged that the captain of the @entity10 ' failed his original navigation test '			1
@entity1 , who famously went down with the ' unsinkable ship ' when it hit an iceberg on its 1912 maiden journey , finally received his masters certificate in february 1888 at the age of 38			1
he is among the well - known seamen to appear in the @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 1850 - 1927 , which were published today on the family history website @entity23			1
the 280,000 documents , released in partnership with the @entity26 , detail the seamen who passed examinations designed to test their experience , general good conduct and sobriety			1
the question ' what shall we do with the drunken sailor ? ' led to @entity37 politicians imposing stricter regulation on seamen with new regulations aimed to combat drunk and disorderly behaviour , which was rife in the @entity42 during the early 19th century			1
launching the newly accessible records in @entity44 today historian @entity46 's @entity45 , said : ' @entity1 who was eventually the man in charge of the @entity10 when it sank failed his exams the first time round because he did not have sufficient navigating skills			1
' in the mid 19th century there was an incredible problem in @entity19 's @entity42 , which was essentially that all the sailors were getting hammered all of the time			1
' it 's quite understandable			1
they were away from their homes for years on end , away from any port for months on end with nothing to do on the ship			2
' in addition to that , water went off very quickly			2
it went brackish and alcohol is obviously quite a robust preservative so they were drinking far more rum than you or i would think to be appropriate			2
' as sailors began to earn a more generous wage , increasing amounts of money were spent on alcohol			2
' x ' marks the spot where the ship sank in the middle of the @entity94 the bow of the @entity10 at rest on the bottom of the @entity94 , about 400 miles southeast of @entity98 ' in the early 1800s , doctors were becoming much more interested in health generally and they realised that this was a real social problem			1
there 's one doctor that i 've read was working on a ship and described one sailor as being so drunk that he had " lost the ability to look after his personal attention " , and somebody else had been drunk non-stop for ten days			1
' the @entity111 documented and recorded all of this and set tests which would ensure that there senior staff were sober and could exhibit good conduct			1
' upon passing , men were awarded a masters certificate as proof that they were fit for service			0
certificates specified the recipient 's name , address , certificate number , birth date , birth place , port of issue , examination date and the previous ships on which they sailed			2
it was the @entity134 of 1850 that led to the introduction of @entity122 by the @entity138 @entity137 and all ranks , from mates to captains , were required to sit these examinations			0
this year marked the 100th anniversary of the @entity144 , immortalised here in the 1997 @entity147 blockbuster of the same name captain @entity149 , the master of the @entity150 was awarded his certificate in @entity152 in 1861 before captaining numerous voyages to @entity154			0
the famous ship is pictured here in @entity157			0
after the new law was introduced in 1850 , disorderly sailors were quickly forced to clean up their act			0
crucially , legislation stated that seamen were no longer permitted to ' sell bad drugs ' , ' work under the influence of alcohol ' or ' fraudulently alter ' their @entity122			2
another famous captain who successfully passed his examinations is captain @entity169 of the renowned @entity138 tea clipper the @entity150 , who was awarded his certificate in @entity152 in 1861 before captaining numerous voyages to @entity154			0
delving into the past : the information came to light following research by tv presenter @entity46 for the programme @entity45 despite running away to sea aged 15 , sir @entity178 qualified as a master in december 1900 and went on to captain the @entity182 , a large ocean liner that was later used as a troopship carrying @entity186 soldiers to the @entity138			0
' all of this stuff is hand - written and the ink has faded , often there 's very bad handwriting and mistakes are made or rats ate the documents , ' said @entity46			1
' so it 's a complex activity , cleaning this up and putting it online , but the more people that become interested in family history the more cost effective it becomes			2
' @entity23 international content director @entity201 said : ' these records provide fascinating insight into @entity42 life at the turn of the @entity37 and signal the end of the stereotypical " drunken " and disorderly sailor			2
' they also went a long way to helping the @entity42 become respected the world over			0
' they are also a rich source of information for anybody looking to find out more about a seafaring relative , or trace the career of a famous captain			0
' @entity218 has used the newly released documents to learn more about the life of his ancestor , the @entity42 's captain @entity221			1
' one of the things i was missing was his masters certificate , which was a very important document to prove that he was actually a qualified captain			0
' captain @entity221 first went to sea in the 1800s as a cabin boy at the age of 15			0
from there he progressed through the ranks to the post of @entity227 , eventually becoming a ship owner			0
' he actually ended up spending 50 years at sea and covering one million miles , which was always his ambition , ' said mr @entity218			0
' during that time he got married and had 10 children , all of whom sailed with him			0
' he actually trained at @entity243 @entity242 hospital to become a midwife so that he could be on hand ( to help deliver his children )			0
