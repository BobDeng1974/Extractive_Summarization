by @entity0 and @entity1 invasive probes into borrowers ' finances and a potential end to short - term mortgage deals has been ordered by the @entity9 , its head @entity2 pictured a massive crackdown on mortgages will come into force next week , with borrowers facing a forensic probe into their personal finances			1
cheap , short - term , fixed - rate deals could also be scrapped in a bid to ensure the irresponsible lending that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis is not repeated			1
the reforms , ordered by the @entity9 , are expected to slow the growth in property prices at a time when experts believe the market is in danger of overheating			1
traditionally , people applying for a mortgage are asked for three months ’ pay slips and recent bank statements			0
but from saturday they will face ‘ invasive ’ questions about their finances and lifestyle , warned @entity2 , chief executive of the @entity9 – from their weekly food bill to the cost of their childcare arrangements and even how much they spend on gym membership			1
the rules , which will hit everyone from first - time buyers to homeowners looking for a new loan , are likely to mean : speaking exclusively to the @entity47 , mr @entity2 admitted the changes would create some problems in the short term			1
‘ in reality is it going to be perfect on day one ? probably not , ’ he said			0
he added that while the new rules would deliver some benefits , there would also be ‘ some things that we are going to have to think again about ’			0
those wanting to move or remortgage in a hurry could face a much longer mortgage application process			0
the action will see a rapid slowdown in house price growth as mortgages become harder to get and take longer to be agreed ( library image ) and families could miss out on buying their dream home as they wait for an interview slot with their lender			1
the interviews themselves could last up to three hours			0
asked if people were ready , or even aware of the changes , mr @entity2 said : ‘ if i ’m honest , no. ’ the reforms mean nobody will be allowed a mortgage unless the lender decides they will be able to afford it , even if interest rates rise sharply			2
at present , nine in ten mortgage borrowers opt for a fixed - rate arrangement , such as a two - year fixed deal			1
from next week , such deals will be much harder to find			0
mr @entity2 said the changes were likely to mean fewer ‘ teaser ’ rates			1
for example , a family might be able to afford a mortgage when they are paying a rock - bottom , fixed rate of two per cent interest			2
but their loan becomes unaffordable when this deal ends , unless they can find another deal at an equally cheap rate , which might not always be possible			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ we have some concerns about those short - term teaser rates that suck people into something			1
the question is : “ can you afford whatever it resets to at the end of that rate ? ” interest - only mortgages will virtually disappear under the new rules			1
the @entity9 head predicted there would be problems with the reforms in the short term lenders will have to ‘ stress test ’ all loans to check the borrower could still afford them if interest rates hit seven per cent			1
at present , the average two - year fixed rate mortgage charges 2.37 per cent			2
for a family with a £ 100,000 loan , this means monthly repayments of £ 442			0
if the rate was seven per cent , the monthly bill would balloon to £ 707 , an increase of £ 265 a month or nearly 60 per cent			0
mr @entity2 said the changes could affect house prices , which are currently rising by around ten per cent a year			2
the @entity9 ’s own analysis found if prices were set to rise by 34 per cent over the next eight years , the rate of growth would fall to 23 per cent as a result of the changes			2
cheaper interest - only mortgage deals , which allow people to pay only the interest on their loan and none of the capital , will virtually disappear			1
mr @entity2 admitted the rules , known as the @entity147 , mean these deals will become ‘ a niche ’			2
@entity150 , senior technical manager of mortgage advisers @entity152 , said many of the questions lenders were being forced to ask were ‘ just ridiculous ’			0
he said : ‘ if the new rules were applied to car insurance , nobody under the age of 25 would be able to drive a car because they would be deemed too risky			0
’ mr @entity150 warned the new rules were ‘ too black and white ’ and had been designed for the ‘ lowest common denominator ’ .			0

short - term , fixed - rate deals could be scrapped in latest reforms
could also see borrowers facing a probe into their finances and lifestyle
