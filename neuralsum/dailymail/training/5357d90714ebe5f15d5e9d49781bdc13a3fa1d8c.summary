a company that helps you get back at your enemies by posting them parcels of glitter has been sold for more than $ 100,000			1
@entity6 , set up the @entity7 only 10 days ago , on a whim			1
the 22 - year - old @entity9 , who admits ' he hates glitter ' created the website that offers to mail a package full of the stuff to anyone , along with a letter telling the recipient they are a horrible person , anywhere in the world for $ 9.99			1
9 @entity21 reported that after mr @entity6 put the website up for sale on start - up marketplace @entity22			1
it was listed with a starting bid of just $ 1 , and ended up selling for $ 105,927 after attracting 345 bids			1
the buyer is reportedly online entrepreneur @entity30			1
' this was only intended to be a small side project			0
it â€™s taken on a life of its own , and i want to watch it continue to grow under a new owner , ' mr @entity6 said			1
an envelope full of millions of tiny , plastic pieces of glitter is all that is needed to tip someone right over the edge , with the sparkly misery promised to last weeks			0
the website was just a day old when mr @entity6 spoke to the @entity71 earlier this month as their sales escalated rapidly			1
' i 'm a 22 year old dude that has too much free time apparently because now my plans for the next few weeks will consist of sending stupid glitter to terrible people , ' @entity6 told @entity71 at the time			1
' people call it the herpes of the craft world , ' the website said			2
' pay us money , provide an address anywhere in the world and we 'll send them so much glitter in an envelope that they 'll be finding it everywhere for weeks			0
' in just 24 hours of the website launching it had gone viral worldwide , with over 1.3m visits , and 250k social shares			2
rave reviews , as well as complaints from unhappy envelope recipients , indicate the product 's effectiveness the glitter will stick to every possible surface of the recipient 's body and home and will continually and inexplicably appear for weeks after the ambush part of the appeal was that each package individually was ' wrapped with hate ' by @entity6 himself for the incredibly low price of $ 9.99 per envelope			1
the hateful envelopes may seem harmless , with some people on @entity115 initially expressing confusion at the concept due to their personal love of glitter			2
however , the frustration felt when covered with seemingly endless pieces of glitter can not be fully understood unless one has experienced the twinkly torture			0
it sticks to clothes , skin , hair and furniture and somehow has the creepy ability to pop up when least expected for weeks after the glitter ambush			0
these envelopes from hell , also known in some circles as ' glitter bombs ' , were soon an overnight sensation , and just hours after launching the website was forced to suspend purchases			0
' you guys have a sick obsession with shipping people glitter , ' remarked @entity6			2
the website has a helpful @entity144 section , although they point out ' yes , somehow we do have frequently asked questions ' the website enjoyed glowing reviews from thrilled customers , including gleeful @entity151 : ' i bought this for my husband , he opened the mail before work & got it everywhere ! he had to change , was late for work and might be getting fired , @entity159 ' however , @entity160 warned people to not underestimate the power of glitter			2
' for my one year anniversary i did n't know what to get my wife , so i bought this thinking it would be funny			0
' it was n't , i 'm now divorced , broke and living with my best friend			0
i 'd like to talk with the owner to get a refund and discuss damages			0
' a thrilled customer wrote a reference , explaining : ' i bought this for my husband , he opened the mail before work & got it everywhere ! he had to change , was late for work and might be getting fired , @entity159 '			0
