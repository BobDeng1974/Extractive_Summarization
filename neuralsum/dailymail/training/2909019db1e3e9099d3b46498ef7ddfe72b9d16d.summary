by @entity0 @entity1 has less than two years to live after being diagnosed with terminal cervical cancer three years after being told her smear test was clear a 45 - year - old woman is today dying of terminal cervical cancer three years after doctors reassured her a routine smear test was clear			1
@entity1 says she has been handed a death sentence as the hospital responsible admitted they had made a fatal mistake in reading the test results			1
ms @entity1 , from @entity13 in @entity14 , has been told by doctors she could have as little as two years left to live			1
@entity15 and @entity16 has admitted full liability for the error , but say no incompetence on the part of staff was involved			1
they are expected to make a financial settlement with ms @entity1 , but she said no amount will ever be enough			1
' i 've been sentenced to death , ' she said			2
her smear test was carried out at her local gp surgery but reviewed by staff at @entity30 in 2008			1
ms @entity1 , an administrator at a haulage company , said : ' this has left me totally devastated			1
it 's changed my life			0
' you think you ’re going to live forever and it ’s taken away from you and it ’s really hard to accept and come to terms with			0
' when i was told i had cervical cancer it felt like i was on a bungee string and it was n’t reality			1
it makes it harder to accept because there was an error			0
' you put your trust in the system to do a smear to have it correctly read and to be told it was n’t , it ’s hard , and i want them to change how little time they spend looking at slides			2
' it was n’t just one person that looked at my slide it was two people , and if both of them misread it , there ’s obviously some kind of error in how it has been dealt with and it needs to be reviewed and changes made			2
' ms @entity1 , who has a long - term partner but no children , feels her future has been snatched away			1
she said : ' money will never be enough because this is my life			0
' had i been murdered by somebody they would be doing time with a possibility of a life sentence and i ’m not going to get that and i have n’t done anything wrong			0
' the trust says its systems are robust and that the staff involved are fully trained , adding that smear tests are not diagnostic tests and are not 100 per cent effective			2
a report of the internal investigation states : ' guidelines were followed			0
false negative results are inevitable in screening even in the best laboratories			2
' it says human error was a factor in the case , saying the ' abnormal cells were in clumps and difficult to interpret '			1
the trust admitted liability but say no incompetence was involved			2
@entity1 , pictured before her cancer diagnosis , was told by doctors in 2008 that the results of her smear test were clear			1
@entity30 and @entity16 have admitted liability for an error in reading the results , but said no incompetence was involved the @entity108 offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25 - 64 every three to five years			1
it is not a test for cervical cancer , but it identifies early abnormalities which , if left untreated , could develop into cancer of the cervix ( neck of the womb )			1
a sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis			0
those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and , if necessary , treatment			0
currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young			1
according to @entity138 statistics , not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009 - 2011			2
the lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the @entity141 on @entity142 ( @entity143 ) advised the @entity108 in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good			0
the committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord , and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children , and could cause significant anxiety			0
many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25 , including @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			0
in @entity164 , women are invited to be checked from the age of 20 , though it is due to go up to 25 next year			0
in @entity167 women are invited from 18 , @entity168 from 20 , and in the @entity170 two years after women become sexually active			0
meanwhile , other countries start cervical screening later			0
both the @entity173 and @entity174 offer screening to women only once they are 30 , and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in @entity180 , and in @entity182 it is for women over 31			2
ms @entity1 ’s lawyers at @entity185 in @entity186 said abnormalities that signalled she was at severe risk of developing the deadly disease were missed on a cervical smear test carried out in 2008			1
@entity191 , ms @entity1 ’s medical negligence solicitor at @entity185 , said : ' once someone is diagnosed with cervical cancer the @entity108 does a review of their case to see if anything could have been picked up earlier			1
' three separate screeners then looked at @entity1 ’s test and all three of them spotted the pre-cancerous cells			2
' we have had our own independent expert review on @entity1 ’s case which revealed that if she had been diagnosed in 2008 she would n’t have needed chemotherapy , could have been treated with a routine procedure and would have made a complete recovery			1
' the solicitor explained that a smear test slide is checked twice			2
the first check takes about eight minutes and any abnormalities should be picked up then			0
any that are reported as clear are sent for a rapid review – a safeguard that is supposed to ensure any signs of cancer that were missed first time around are detected			0
but she said as the second check only takes a minute there is greater room for error			0
' as a safeguard to pick up on signs that were missed first time it ’s inadequate , ' she said			0
@entity227 , chief executive at @entity30 , said : ' we are desperately sorry to hear about mrs @entity1 ’s illness			2
' we fully investigated the circumstances of mrs @entity1 smear test report from 2008 , and found that her screening test did not identify a problem that might have then been treated earlier			1
' we have accepted full liability for this and apologised			1
' when we investigated the smear report , we also checked all the training , practice and standards of our screeners , and found it to be all correct			0
' the screeners who provide the programme are trained to the highest standard			0
their work is continually quality assessed on a routine basis , and external quality assurance visits are in place to check those standards			0
' screening reduces the chance of cervical cancer by about 75 per cent , but no screening programme can be 100 per cent effective			1
' @entity257 and regional quality experts advise that false negative tests do occur , and can not be completely avoided			0
' it is really important that women go for their cervical smear test when invited – more than half of all cervical cancers occur in women who are eligible for screening , but do n’t attend			1

@entity1 went for a routine smear test at her gp surgery in 2008
after medics at @entity30 reviewed the results she was told the test , which looks for **precancerous** cells , was clear
three years later the 45 - year - old was diagnosed with cervical cancer
she has been told it is terminal and that she has as little as two years to live
@entity30 and @entity16 has admitted full liability for the error but say no incompetence was involved
@entity16 has apologised to ms @entity1 and is expected to *pay* *compensation*
hospital bosses explained smear screening programmes are never 100 *%* effective , but accepted human error did play a part in misreading the test
ms @entity1 's lawyer said had the **precancerous** cells been spotted in 2008 the 45 - year - old would have made a full recovery
ms @entity1 said : ' i 've been sentenced to death *...* i *'m* totally devastated '
