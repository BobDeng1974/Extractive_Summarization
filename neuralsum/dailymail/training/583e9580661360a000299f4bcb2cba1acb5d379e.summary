by @entity1 reporter published : 14:48 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 11:46 est , 20 october 2013 when you think of fine dining , @entity2 is probably not at the top of your list , but that did n't stop a group of chefs attempting to turn the chain 's fast food into gourmet cuisine			1
with creations ranging from kung pao @entity16 to tapas and slow - cooked beef with @entity21 gnocchi , the foods appeared to be worlds apart from the usual fast food fare of burgers and fries found at the golden arches			0
award - winning chefs @entity28 , of @entity30 ’s @entity29 , @entity31 of @entity33 fame , @entity36 winner @entity35 and @entity2 in - house chef @entity34 all competed against each other at an event in @entity39 to create some exotic dishes			1
@entity42 workers : chef @entity35 , @entity44 's @entity43 chef @entity34 , @entity45 , chef @entity31 and chef @entity28 teamed up to create gourmet recipes using @entity2 's ingredients happy meal : guests enjoyed a unique gourmet dish made with @entity44 's @entity43 quality ingredients created by chef @entity52 @entity53 with @entity54 and @entity56 's @entity55 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 not coming to a restaurant near you : the dishes were all created for a one - off event ... but it shows you what can be achieved ! meanwhile , the rest of us will have be content with a @entity75 and fries the transformation wizardry did n't stop at the food either			1
among the drinks being offered were a mango pineapple mojito , made with the mango smoothie base , and a bacon old fashioned			0
the first dish , from chef @entity28 , was kung pao @entity16			0
three nuggets doused in sweet and sour sauce , rice wine vinegar and peanuts atop a small bed of shredded @entity75 lettuce with sliced orange , according to @entity93			0
would you like fries with that ? @entity44 's @entity43 chef @entity34 , @entity45 , prepared dishes featuring only @entity44 's ingredients @entity99 ( @entity100 ) featuring @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 slow - cooked beef with @entity106 and @entity107			1
featuring @entity44 's @entity108 , @entity57 , @entity109 , carrots and the 100 % beef ground for the @entity2 ' hamburger patties @entity113 upgraded : chef @entity35 prepared a @entity115 dish drink up : @entity34 , @entity45 , created unique cocktails including a @entity118 base and @entity44 's @entity119 fancy a drink ? @entity121 with @entity122 's @entity119 , @entity123 next up was chef @entity31 ’s tortilla espanola			1
made with @entity44 ’s hash browns and eggs , combined with both chipotle bbq and honey mustard sauces , as well as a garlic and saffron aioli , @entity93 called it ‘ the most transformative dish of the night			2
’ ‘ you could tell it was @entity44 's ingredients , ’ the site added , ‘ but it did n't taste like anything on the actual menu			1
’ the next dish was the one most likely to end up on a @entity44 ’s menu			2
from chef @entity35 , it boasted sliced crispy chicken stacked on top of hash browns and topped with a fried egg , jack cheddar cheeses and applewood smoked bacon on a bed of chipotle bbq sauce and espresso			0
ideas unlimited : event provided diners with a new perspective on @entity44 's food and quality ingredients @entity163 's @entity162 , @entity55 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity57 , @entity119 and salad variety : the evening included cocktails , appetizers and several entrees chef @entity34 , perhaps due to her unparalleled and intimate knowledge of ingredients at the fast food giant , created what appeared to be the two best dishes of the night			1
the first was a slow - cooked beef with blueberry pomegranate sauce and @entity21 gnocchi			0
the blueberries and pomegranates come from the smoothies and the fries were turned into a potato gnocchi			0
the slow - cooked beef was the same meat used by the fast food chain prior to turning it into burger meat			0
dessert looked just as mouthwatering as chef @entity34 made a doughnut from the chain ’s biscuit mix and topped it with pumpkin spice latte syrup			2
but do n’t hold your breath and expect these new creations to be on the menu at your local @entity2 - it was strictly a one - off event , one that truly provided food for thought !			2

the one - off event was held earlier this month in @entity39
top - *flight* chefs from @entity39 , *television* and @entity2 took part
@entity44 's chef @entity34 *handily* beat her *competition*
