this is the painful moment a man infested with parasitic ‘ jigger ’ fleas is forced to have them cut out of his foot with a scalpel			1
the man 's foot is massively swollen and disfigured , having been plagued with jiggers for years , leaving him unable to walk			1
the skin on his foot is flaky and pitted from previous infestations			1
the resulting wounds can lead to infections like gangrene and hepatitis jigger fleas cause swelling , ulceration , itching and infections and the pain leaves many people with walking problems			1
the only way to remove the jiggers is to cut them out of the feet - usually with no anaesthetic @entity37 , or chigoe fleas , are sand fleas found in @entity20 climates that burrow into the skin and lay eggs			1
they cause swelling , itching and infection which can lead to amputation and even death in the worst cases			1
a healthcare worker cuts away nodules where the jiggers have buried into the man ’s foot , wiping away the flea and the surrounding pus and blood with cotton wool			1
cutting the fleas out of the foot and soaking it in alcohol or another disinfectant is the only way to treat the disease once an infestation has occurred			2
cutting out the jiggers is a painful process , and often all the jiggers can not be removed in one sitting			0
in @entity71 , an estimated 1.4 million people ( translating to four per cent of the total population ) suffer from jigger infestation			2
jiggers are small chigoe fleas that live in the dust , and are found on the dirt floors in schools and the homes of many families in @entity80 and other similar climates			2
these parasitic insects cling to livestock and transfer jiggers into homes primarily in rural areas			0
the female jiggers burrow into the surface of skin that has been exposed to the flea			1
once embedded in the body , the jigger lays eggs and creates up to pea - size egg sacks and continues to multiply by laying more eggs			1
these wounds are painful , and cause difficulties for victims in daily activities such as walking , playing , and attending school			0
the infection can lead to severe inflammation , ulceration and fibrosis			2
it can also cause lymphangitis , gangrene , sepsis , and the loss of toenails , amputation of the digits , and death may also occur			2
there is also a social stigma and shame associated with the victims of jiggers which causes them to hide the problem which makes it worse			0
while jiggers in small numbers are not deadly , the secondary infections ( gangrene , tetanus and other diseases ) caused by jiggers can be fatal			1
source : @entity128 they leave most victims unable to walk work , or carry out any activities such as going to school			0
areas of @entity80 , @entity135 and other @entity137 countries with similar climates also have large areas of infestation			0
the female jiggers burrow into the skin , usually of the hands and feel , and lay egg sacks which can grow up to the size of a pea			1
the flea continue to multiply by laying more eggs , causing an infection which leads the body to become ulcerated and inflamed			2
it can also cause lymphangitis - a swelling of the lymph nodes , as well as gangrene , tetanus and blood poisoning			1
victims often lose their toenails and are forced to have their digits amputated			0
while in small numbers jiggers are not deadly , the secondary infections such as gangrene and tetanus can be fatal			2
there is also a social stigma and shame associated with the victims of joggers which causes them to hide the problem , making it worse			0
patients often use the same scalpel or pin to cut out the jiggers , therefore infections such as hiv / aids are passed from person to person			1
@entity37 also burrow into the skin of animals like dogs , cats , rats , pigs , cattle and sheep , so people living in rural areas are likely to catch them			0
but they are also found in the dust and on dirt floors of many homes and schools			0
for a complete eradication of the bug , thorough fumigation of homes , schools and animals need to take place			0
charities in infected regions also encourage the local populations to wear shoes and observe cleanliness to prevent future infestations			0

here , a nodule has been cut away on the man 's foot to reveal the jigger underneath ( green , centre of foot ) the health worker removes the jigger with a scalpel , leaving a pitted wound the jigger is wiped in cotton wool and the scalpel cleaned before another flea is cut out			1
