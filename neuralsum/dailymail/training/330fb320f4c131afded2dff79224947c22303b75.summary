red - faced defence chiefs squandered millions of pounds on 6,000 pistols that were scrapped after just five years			1
in a damning example of waste of the @entity5 , top brass bought the @entity7 handguns before ditching them in favour of @entity11 - made glocks			1
the embarrassing fiasco came at a time when the cash - strapped department was axing 30,000 troops , fighter jets , warships and tanks in a desperate bid to save money			1
but in january last year the @entity31 announced that after extensive tests it was replacing the ageing standard - issue @entity34 - era @entity36 pistol - introduced nearly 50 years ago - with the @entity38 gen 4 handgun			1
more than 25,000 are being purchased for @entity29 ’s @entity39 under a £ 9 million contract			0
the firearm - made famous in countless @entity42 movies such as @entity43 - is lighter , carries more bullets , fires more quickly and accurately , and is safer to handle than the @entity36			1
but it has fuelled fresh criticism of the @entity5 's procurement policies , raising questions over why taxpayers ' cash was splurged on the @entity51			1
the @entity52 has spent £ 6 billion on @entity53 , or @entity54 , which has involved rushing new kit into service in @entity57 and @entity30 when existing equipment proves to be dangerously inadequate			2
obsolete : used between 2008 and 2013 , the pistols were @entity7 models similar to the one above major @entity61 , who served in @entity63 with the @entity64 , hit out at the purchase of the @entity51 as an example of waste , rather than long - term capital investment			1
he said : ' what we 've been having is the military equivalent of a fast - food diet			1
we need to get back to a more sustainable , balanced diet			0
' major gen @entity74 , the head of the @entity31 's @entity75 , denied that public money had been wasted			0
he said the @entity51 had been used in @entity30 and some of the money spent ' may well be recovered when they 're disposed of '			2
an @entity5 spokesman said : ' it is wrong to suggest the @entity5 wasted money on @entity7 pistols , which were bought in 2008 to meet an urgent operational requirement and used by @entity29 forces in @entity57 and @entity30 for five years			1
' by 2013 , extensive tests showed the @entity38 pistol offered a better long term solution to replace the @entity36 in terms of its capability and value for money			2
' meanwhile , it has emerged that a freak 30 - minute hailstorm caused £ 10million damage to @entity96 planes in @entity30			1
damage : cricket ball sized hailstones also punched holes in @entity100 transporter planes like the one pictured cricket ball - sized hailstones punched holes in five @entity100 transport planes			0
up to 15 other aircraft , including two vip jets and @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 helicopters were damaged , but the repair bill has not yet been calculated the storm last april bombarded the huge @entity115 airbase in @entity116 causing ' serious damage '			0
the hail damaged 851 aircraft panels including wings , flying controls , windscreens and fuselages			0
four @entity100 , which operate as a ' taxi service ' shifting troops , equipment and supplies around the warzone , were returned to the @entity29 for repair work under @entity130 at a cost of around £ 3million			0
the fifth was repaired in @entity30			2
the storm caused damage to 80 coalition aircraft - more in the space of an hour than the @entity137 has managed in 12 years of war			0
it was so severe that three @entity30 civilians were killed by falling balls of ice			2
defence minister @entity143 finally confirmed the details in answer to a parliamentary question			0
some of the planes are still out of action			0
an @entity5 spokesman said : ' while we monitor the weather , this storm could not be predicted			0

troops given the @entity7 guns for urgent self - protection in @entity30
but they were scrapped last year in favour of @entity11 - made @entity38 *17s*
@entity161 came as @entity5 axed fighter jets , warships , tanks and 30,000 troops
