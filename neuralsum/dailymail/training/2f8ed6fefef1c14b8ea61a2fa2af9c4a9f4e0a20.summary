by @entity0 three daring @entity2 men have been captured on film using their thongs to fight a grass fire caused by a firecracker on the @entity7 ’s annual day to set off fireworks across the state			1
@entity10 erupted from bemused onlookers as the bare foot men made the halfhearted attempt to put out the billowing blaze with one man encouraging them to ‘ keep going for it ’ while fireworks can be heard going off in the background			1
the footage shows another man using the garden hose in an attempt to control the fire before a fire engine turns up to save the day , and a fireman extinguishes the blaze with a hose from the truck			1
‘ i was down there in amongst it and there were a lot of people doing a lot of strange things , so i ’m not really surprised , although it has n’t been brought to our attention , ’ she said			0
more firecrackers wreaked havoc in @entity59 with a boat catching alight and at @entity61 where a firecracker torpedoed into a hayshed and burnt it down			2
despite these dramatic scenes , authorities were impressed with the behaviour of most @entity68 on the only day of the year when it is legal for locals to let off firecrackers as part of the @entity74 celebrations			1
@entity37 director @entity36 had expected 30 to 50 significant fires , however there was just one main incident where 100 hectares were burned at @entity79 , but was n’t a threat to homes or people , and just nine fires in total			0
mr @entity36 described the actions of the men who used their thongs as ' inappropriate '			2
he advised people should have a bucket of water nearby on firecracker night in case of a fire			1
there have been 15 people so far who have turned up to emergency departments and clinics with fire cracker injuries , with most suffering burnt hands and fingers			0
the most major incidents were when a 19 year - old woman was struck in the ear while another suffered burns to the neck			1
the garden hose was put to use before the fire brigade turned up @entity112 registrar @entity111 said this was a significantly low number compared to last year with 25 – 35 incidents reported			0
‘ although it varies from year to year – we have been monitoring it since 1998 and there seems to be no overall trend , ’ she said			0
but ms @entity111 said it was expected more people would come forward with injuries over the coming days as their condition worsened and possible further firecrackers being let off			0
the men breath a sigh of relief as the @entity128 arrive on the scene the blaze is extinguished by a professional fire fighter			2
