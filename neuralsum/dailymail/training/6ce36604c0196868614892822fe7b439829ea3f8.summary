what was once a hub for ski lovers and home to more than 100 ice sheets may be stripped of its very identity as climate change affects the ecosystem			0
@entity9 may have to undergo a name change in the next 16 years -- the time the @entity9 's namesake glaciers are expected to disappear completely , the @entity13 reports			1
@entity14 reports that the @entity9 's glaciers have rapidly declined in number since its establishment in 1910			1
the @entity13 reports that the @entity9 was once home to some 150 ice sheets , now that number is less than 30			2
decline : above are photos of the @entity21 in 1913 ( left ) and the glacier photographed in 2012 ( right ) illustrating the decline in the size of the @entity9 's glaciers the cause of the glacial recession in the @entity9 that boasts nearly 1,600 square miles is no secret : climate change			1
the @entity13 reports that small ski areas that once riddled the park have since closed due to shorter winter seasons and snows too light to keep them open			0
streams in the @entity9 that are fed by melted snow are reaching peak spring flows earlier than in the past and low summer flows earlier than usual			1
glaciers : above are photos of the @entity40 in 1910 ( left ) and photographed again in 2012 ( right ) farmers who depend on the snow melt in the warmer months fear that the water they need will not be available			2
dried out soil from warmer , drier summers have resulted in an increase of wildfires in the park , according to the @entity13			0
even the wildlife is suffering , the @entity13 reports that the @entity51 population is decreasing as water temperatures rise			2
ecosystem : @entity54 , a @entity14 research ecologist , ( above ) said that the dwindling glaciers impact the @entity9 's ecosystem the @entity58 park has been called the center of the ' @entity60 , ' -- the @entity61 joining northwest @entity58 , southwest @entity62 , and southeast @entity63 , according to the @entity64			1
@entity54 , a @entity14 research ecologist , said that dwindling glacier size means ' we 're on the cusp of bigger changes			0
' ' we ’re a snow - driven ecosystem , and glaciers are just a part of that , ' @entity54 said			1
' the way the snow goes is the way our ecosystem goes			0
' @entity58 : @entity9 is located in @entity58 on the @entity76 – @entity78 border and is nearly 1,600 square miles			0

@entity9 may be losing its namesake as rising temperatures have *claimed* nearly all of its glaciers in the last century
the disappearing glaciers are affecting wildlife , farmer 's livelihoods , and the *safety* of the @entity9 itself
ecologist : ' the way the snow goes is the way our ecosystem goes . '
