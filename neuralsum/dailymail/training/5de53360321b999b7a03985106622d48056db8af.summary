double mastectomy : @entity1 opted for pre-emptive surgery after discovering it would virtually eliminate her high risk of breast cancer @entity6 understands better than most the heartbreak behind @entity1 ’s double mastectomy			1
@entity1 opted for pre-emptive surgery after discovering it would virtually eliminate her high risk of breast cancer due to a faulty @entity11 gene — the same gene linked to her mother ’s death from ovarian cancer at 57			1
the film star also plans to have her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to reduce her higher risk of ovarian cancer			2
and just this week it was revealed that the star ’s aunt had died of breast cancer , aged 61			2
@entity24 , the sister of @entity1 ’s mother , also carried the faulty @entity11 gene			1
@entity6 , 39 , has the same faulty gene			1
the occupational psychologist from @entity29 was , like @entity1 , given frightening odds of developing these gynaecological cancers			1
she was tested for the faulty gene nine years ago after her mother , who had ovarian cancer , was found to carry it			1
her mother died a few months after she took the test			2
but @entity6 agonises over whether to have her breasts and ovaries removed			1
‘ i ’m not convinced that having a double mastectomy will make a real difference to my health prospects , given the effectiveness of breast screening , ’ says the mother of a three - year - old girl			1
‘ but i feel that getting rid of my ovaries is critical , mainly because ovarian cancer is hard to detect and treat , and it will also have a preventative impact on breast cancer			0
yet it ’s terrifying as it will propel me into an early menopause , with everything that involves			0
’ but some experts are n’t convinced that removing healthy tissue is protective			0
furthermore , they fear that genetic tests such as the one @entity1 had could create an ever - growing group of ‘ worried well ’ : women and men whose life is changed for the worse as the discovery of the faulty gene means they face surgery to remove healthy body parts			1
for while it ’s relatively rare to have faulty @entity11 and @entity68 genes , a far larger group of ‘ cancer predisposition genes ’ have been identified , with a new test for these due to be launched in 2014			1
known as the @entity70 , the test — which costs a few hundred pounds — checks for 97 genes linked to a greater risk of cancer			0
from next year , it will be available to all newly diagnosed cancer patients ; it ’s estimated around 2 per cent every year will be found to have one or more of these genes			1
the relatives of these patients will also be offered the test			0
the results will enable doctors to tailor therapies to patients with cancer			0
for their relatives , the information will mean that ‘ screening or preventative measures can be employed ’ , explains professor @entity90 , head of genetics at the @entity92			0
yet such tests open up the possibility that not just breasts and ovaries , but other healthy body parts — such as the thyroid gland or moles — could be removed as a preventative measure			0
last week , it was reported that a 53 - year - old @entity29 man has become the first person in the world to have his prostate removed after discovering he has a faulty @entity68 gene			1
this is despite the fact there ’s only limited evidence that having the faulty gene will mean a man has an increased chance of developing an aggressive form of prostate cancer			1
‘ removal of the prostate is radical surgery that can cause serious long - term side - effects including erectile dysfunction and incontinence			0
we do not advocate at this stage that other men with this gene fault but no known cancer are offered prostate removal , ’ says dr @entity129 , of @entity131 @entity130			1
one leading expert who is not convinced about the case for removing healthy tissue is @entity135 , professor of surgical oncology at @entity137 , @entity29			0
‘ future generations will look back in horror at the practice of cutting off a woman ’s breasts in the belief that it will prevent cancer , ’ he says			0
‘ sadly , for some women this may prove a vain hope			0
’ professor @entity135 was one of the first clinicians to recognise the potential for ‘ difficult consultations ’ resulting from the breakthrough in identifying the faulty @entity11 and @entity68 genes			1
passing : @entity1 's aunt @entity153 passed away early sunday morning hours after being taken off life support writing in the @entity156 in 1998 , he warned that he and his colleagues would be faced with ‘ an increasing number of well ‑ informed young women with pathological mutations ’ for whom ‘ no proved preventative approaches will obliterate the risk ’			0
in the @entity164 , professor @entity135 called for all cases of preventative mastectomy to be recorded on a central register , so women subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer could be identified to show if the operation was beneficial			2
‘ i discussed it with the @entity181 , but nothing was ever done , ’ he told the @entity171 this @entity172 , the predictions about how much preventative surgery reduces the risks are based on studies of small groups of women over short periods of time			0
for instance , one carried out at the @entity185 followed 139 women with the faulty genes , 76 of whom underwent a preventative mastectomy			2
after two - and - a - half years , there were no cases of breast cancer in the group who had surgery , compared with eight cancers in those who did not have the op. another study at the @entity201 in the @entity202 found that three out of 214 women developed breast cancer over three years following a preventative mastectomy			1
mother and daughter : the star 's mother , @entity207 , tragically passed award from the disease in 2007 ‘ we ’d have much better information if we ’d been able to follow every woman with the faulty gene who has undergone a preventative double mastectomy , ’ says professor @entity135			1
‘ as it is , we do n’t even know how many women have had the operation in the @entity130			0
’ and while we do n’t have a clear picture of how extensively the surgery prevents cancer , there is evidence non-surgical preventative strategies do work			0
last year , the @entity226 ( @entity226 ) recommended preventative anti-oestrogen treatment for women at increased risk of breast cancer but who ’ve never had the disease			2
for the first time , hormonal medications , particularly tamoxifen , are recommended for healthy women with the faulty @entity11 gene — with research suggesting these reduce the incidence of breast cancer in cancer gene carriers by 49 per cent			1
a major study by @entity241 following 5,000 men and women with the faulty genes is also investigating how far changes in lifestyle , such as exercise and nutrition , reduce the cancer risk			2
there ’s evidence , too , showing the risk of dying is reduced by annual screening ( with mri scans for women with the faulty @entity11 and brca2 genes between the ages of 30 and 50 ; after that age , annual mammograms )			1
a major @entity202 study published in the @entity262 in 2010 analysed survival rates in women with the cancer genes and found that those who undergo intensive surveillance live as long as those who have their breast tissue removed — though they are more likely to develop breast cancer			0
but it is also important to note that having the faulty gene does not mean cancer is inevitable , says @entity272 , clinical nurse specialist at the charity @entity273			1
‘ breast cancer is not a genetic disease like @entity275 ’s where the defective gene guarantees the development of the disease			2
having a cancer gene increases the risk of cancer , but you may also die in old age of something else entirely			2
’ fighting on : @entity1 , pictured with fiance @entity284 , bravely revealed she had undergone a double mastectomy in february after being identified as carrying the @entity11 cancer gene yet psychologically , it seems , there ’s much appeal in ‘ being proactive ’ , as @entity1 put it , by surgically removing healthy tissue			1
indeed , the opportunity for prophylactic surgery can give women found to have the cancer gene the feeling of being back in control , says dr @entity297 , breast oncologist at @entity299			2
‘ it ’s a different option to picking up a cancer that has already developed and which may require radiotherapy and chemotherapy as well as surgery within a short time frame , ’ she says			0
‘ prophylactic surgery can be planned with plenty of time to consider breast reconstruction options and almost certainly avoids the need for further treatment			0
’ @entity6 has so far chosen intensive surveillance — with annual breast scans and ultrasound of her ovaries			2
a few weeks ago , however , news of a cousin with terminal ovarian cancer at the age of 31 has forced her to reconsider			0
as a mother already , @entity6 ca n’t imagine wanting more children , not least as she was divorced last year			1
‘ yet making a decision that ends that option is also tough — even though keeping my ovaries feels as though i ’m playing @entity326 roulette with four bullets in the gun			0
’ despite her concerns , @entity6 has no doubt where she stands on genetic testing			2
‘ for me , knowledge is power			0
the fact that my mother was dissuaded from being tested and did n’t know that she had the @entity11 gene until it was too late still plagues us as a family , ’ she says			1
‘ i spend lots of time going to screening appointments , and the knowledge that i ’ve got to bite the bullet torments me			0
but i am the lucky one — i have the power to make an informed choice			0

@entity6 has the same faulty @entity11 gene
the 39 - year - old has been given frightening odds of developing cancer
mother - of - three is not convinced a double mastectomy will make a different
