this exceptionally rare moment nearly ended in disaster			0
@entity2 , a freediver who was spearfishing off the @entity6 , @entity7 , coast , came face - to - face with an angry sea lion			1
thankfully , quick - thinking @entity2 used the butt of his speargun to scare the animal away - just seconds after it charged towards him with its mouth open			1
@entity2 , a freediver in @entity7 , experienced an exceptionally scary - and exceptionally rare - moment as a pasing sea lion attacked the day started out harmless enough			1
@entity2 was enjoying a peaceful dive , along with his camera , used to capture the lovely underwater views , when a colony of sea lions swam toward him			0
one sea lion seemed particularly curious about @entity2 and , after swimming by several times , made his move			2
quick - acting @entity2 , however , used his spear to push the animal away , before the sea lion could charge him			1
' i am guessing the sea lion were patrolling in the open ocean and were attracted to the bait fish that were nearby , ' @entity2 said			2
' at first , it looked like they were just curious and approached me from the blue water			0
one of them made several passes and then as it got closer , it rushed towards me with its mouth open			0
while spearfishing yellowtail off the coast of @entity6 , @entity2 was greeted by a colony of sea lions the encounter began peacefully enough , but one particular adult sea lion tore away - and charged toward @entity2 thinking quickly , @entity2 brandished the aggressive animal with his spear gun , sending it into retreat ' i was not hurt at all , just a bit shaken when it first occurred			1
i 've had them do mock rushes before where they blow bubbles in your face , but this one came much closer and as soon as it rushed toward me , i swung the butt of my gun up and it stopped short			0
i was n't sure if it was going to rush me again , so i swung the gun back up with the muzzle towards the group and they took off			0

@entity67 @entity2 came face to face with an aggressive sea lion
thinking quickly , he used his speargun to brandish the animal
