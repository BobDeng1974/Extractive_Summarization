it turns out you do n't need to eat your spinach to get the world 's biggest arms			2
@entity8 bodybuilder @entity7 eats seven pounds of protein , nine pounds of carbohydrates and three gallons of water each day to help maintain upper arms that measure 31 inches around — as big as a small man 's waist			1
skeptics say there must also be steroids or some other artificial means behind @entity7 's beyond - bulging biceps and triceps , and @entity21 is wavering on whether to recognize him			1
he can lift up to 600 pounds diet : @entity7 eats lunch at his favorite @entity41 restaurant after his daily workout			1

' it 's not easy having the world 's biggest arms			2
generous amounts of poultry , seafood and shakes provide the protein he needs to fuel daily two - hour workouts in which he lifts as much as 600 pounds			1
he also takes mineral and vitamin supplements and drinks plenty of water to flush out his system			1
then there 's clothes shopping			2
the rest of @entity7 's body is average , so it 's a challenge finding shirts that fit his arms without making him look like a little kid playing dress - up			2
not to mention the controversy that ensued when @entity21 decided to recognize him as having the largest upper arm muscles on earth and critics accused him of using steroids or other artificial methods			1
he lost a night of sleep but then decided the criticism ' is motivation for me — it 's not something that 's gon na put me down			2

he went , but then the controversy started			2
strangers claimed online that he used steroids or had implants in his arms			0
others speculated that he might have injected his muscles with a synthetic oil substance , synthol , used by bodybuilders to fluff muscle tissues			0
' it is hurtful , ' @entity7 said , noting that he has no scars that would have resulted from surgery and that supporting a wife in the @entity110 and family members in @entity25 does n't leave him with spare cash to buy pricey synthetic oils			1
he even went to @entity156 to appear in a @entity158 documentary program in which independent doctors collected blood samples and x-rayed his muscles			0
they found nothing abnormal , he said			0
still , @entity21 hastily removed references to @entity7 from its website			0
spokeswoman @entity165 said in october that @entity21 was conducting research with medical specialists and reviewing @entity7 's category			0
she did not respond to emailed questions later seeking details about when @entity21 would conclude the review and what it entails			0
some fellow amateur bodybuilders at his gym , however , support @entity7 and say they believe his arms are natural			0
' when i first saw him i thought " @entity179 , he 's a freak " — the big @entity0 arms , he 's incredible , but he works out hard , so good luck to him , ' said @entity183			0
@entity7 has lifted as much as 600 pounds but said he does n't typically focus on how much weight he is hoisting			0
' it 's not about me lifting heavy weights , ' he said			0
' it 's about me making the right techniques , even with the light weights , but getting good results out of that			0
' namesake : but unlike the original @entity0 ( right ) ' @entity193 ' says he hates spinach , preferring his high protein , high carbohydrate diet			1
he can now lift an incredible 600lbs he has a daily exercise regime of 5am until 8am during which he concentrates on cardio , strength - training and body sculpting , using heavy and light isolated weights			1
' working out makes my mood better			0
' and i like that in this type of sport you can see your improvement in your shape , ' he says			0
' i know they are growing , my chest , my shoulders , my arms			0
