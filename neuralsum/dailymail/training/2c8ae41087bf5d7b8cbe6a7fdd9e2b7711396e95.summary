by @entity0 like magic : @entity2 , 76 , pictured with wife @entity3 , has been helped with his ' trigger finger ' @entity2 is renowned for his sleight of hand , whether dealing a pack of cards or saw his wife and assistant , ‘ the lovely @entity10 ’ , in half			1
but a year ago , while the veteran magician was performing a card move for a packed audience , he realised things were n’t going according to plan			2
the old dexterity was missing			0
‘ the ring finger of my right hand had locked into a bent position , ’ he says			1
‘ i improvised my way out of it by pressing the finger against my body and clicking it back into shape , before continuing the trick			2
‘ one of the reasons my magic tricks do n’t go wrong is because i never tell the audience what i ’m going to do , so i can swing round and change direction			0
but it was a close - run thing ! ’ after consulting his gp , @entity2 , 76 , was referred to @entity34 , a specialist hand surgeon , who treated him two years earlier when he severed his left index finger with a saw while making props for his act			1
mr @entity34 diagnosed the problem as trigger finger , also known as stenosing tenosynovitis , which causes the fingers or thumb to catch or lock when bent or straightened			1
about three in every 100 people are affected			0
‘ usually , the tendon [ a band of tissue that connects the muscles and bones ] fits perfectly in a tunnel [ sheath ] and glides easily , ’ he says			2
‘ but if it wears in a particular area , the fibres break and form a lump where they heal			0
‘ when you flex your fingers and try to open them again , the tendon snags in the narrowest part of the tunnel and sticks , leaving your finger in a bent position			1
as the lump repeatedly rubs against the narrowest part of the tunnel , the tendon becomes inflamed and soon begins to hurt			0
’ the condition arises among people from all walks of life and ages – even young children			0
‘ you rarely find a cause , although trigger finger is more common in people with diabetes and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis , ’ says mr @entity34			1
‘ @entity2 ’s condition was probably longstanding and , i suspect , aggravated by the fact that he makes his own magic props			1
’ mild trigger finger may improve without treatment or after taking anti-inflammatory drugs , but if the problem does n’t disappear after a few days it is advisable to visit your gp , who may be able to treat it by a cortisone ( steroids , an anti-inflammatory ) injection			1
@entity98 fix : how the six - minute operation to treat stenosing tenosynovitis is carried out this cures about 50 per cent of patients			1
for more severe cases , the injection may buy time , but the condition is likely to resurface			0
@entity2 says : ‘ it is painful – a shooting pain up my finger			1
last year i had an injection which flattened the tendon and released the finger , but when the problem returned , the specialist suggested a minor operation , which would probably mean it never came back			1
’ @entity2 underwent the six - minute procedure under local anaesthetic at @entity118 in @entity119 earlier this year			1
‘ the preparation and injections took longer than the op itself and i did n’t feel a thing , ’ he says			0
the surgeon makes a 1cm cut across the base of the finger at about the level of the palm crease			0
a small incision is made into the place where the tendon is stuck , which is usually enough to release it , or a piece of the sheath can be removed			2
the wound is then stitched and dressed			0
mr @entity34 says : ‘ i always stress to patients that it ’s vital to keep the hand above the level of the heart afterwards , otherwise the finger swells and you may experience bleeding around the tendon , which might cause it to stick again			2
in @entity2 ’s case , i put his hand in a sling to keep it elevated			2
you must also keep flexing the finger through the full range			0
’ mr @entity34 is confident that @entity2 will regain full use of his finger			1
@entity2 ’s stitches were removed after two weeks and his finger is much improved			1
‘ i have enough movement to get back to work			0
there is such a range of magic that if the sleights of hand have to be changed , so be it			0
and if they become impossible , there are thousands of tricks that can be done without digital dexterity			0
’ @entity2 and @entity3 tour in their new magic show , @entity170 ... despite @entity171 , from september 18			2

magician @entity2 , 76 , was diagnosed with trigger finger
