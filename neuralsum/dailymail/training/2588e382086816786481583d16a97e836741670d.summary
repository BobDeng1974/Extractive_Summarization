hoods , tattoos and big hair : another half dozen suspects police want to identify pictures of suspected rioters are being displayed on huge advertising vans being driven around @entity79 and @entity98 , where hundreds took part in disorder earlier this week			1
and while this resort is helping to identify suspects it is also prompting those involved to turn themselves in			0
a youth handed himself in after his friend saw his picture on the ad vans and called him to say his image was all over @entity79 and he had no place to hide , a @entity107 police spokesman said			1
and in @entity115 a mother frogmarched her 15 - year - old daughter to the police station after she saw cctv images of her released by police			1

mr @entity126 said : ' we said we would be coming for you , and we are			0
' within minutes of the ad van being launched in @entity79 with the faces of some of those people involved , we have been inundated with information from members of the public about who these people are			1
the faces of frenzy : these are just some of the people police want to identify in connection with the riots ' these are just some of the good arrests we have made			1
i have been told of countless more by officers who are using every piece of information and every available avenue to find these people and bring them in			2
' with the help of our communities we are identifying these people and arresting them			0
this is just the start - we will not rest until we have identified everyone involved			0

the hunted : can you identify any of the people in these pictures ? if so , contact police meanwhile there is growing friction between politicians and police as chancellor @entity239 signalled the government 's determination to press ahead with cuts to police budgets			2
he said that dealing with the violent disorder meant tackling ' deep - seated social problems ' , not scaling back austerity measures			2
' we are committed to the plan we have set out for police reform , ' he told the @entity251 - insisting that a 20 per cent real - terms budget cut need not reduce ' visible ' policing			2
' but this is not just about police budgets ; this is about a far bigger challenge for our society , which is dealing with people who we have ignored for too long and helping them feel they have a stake in society			0
' he strongly backed the decision by prime minister @entity263 to bring in @entity266 ' @entity265 ' @entity264 as an adviser on how to prevent a repeat of the riots			0
