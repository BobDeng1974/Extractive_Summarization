a two - year - old girl born without a windpipe has become the youngest patient in the world to receive a bio-engineered organ after doctors implanted her with a special tube grown from her own stem cells			1
@entity8 has been unable to breathe , eat , drink or swallow on her own since she was born in @entity9 in 2010			1
until the april 9 operation at the @entity12 of @entity13 , the toddler had spent her entire life in a hospital in @entity16			1
doctors there told her parents there was no hope and they expected her to die			1
the stem cells came from @entity8 's bone marrow , extracted with a special needle inserted into her hip bone			1
they were seeded in a lab onto a plastic scaffold , where it took less than a week for them to multiply and create a new windpipe			2
about the size of a 3 - inch tube of penne pasta , it was implanted in a nine - hour procedure			1
new windpipe : in this april 26 , 2013 photo provided by @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity13 , @entity8 , 2 , lies in bed in a post-op room at the @entity39 in @entity40 , after having received a new windpipe early signs indicate the windpipe is working , although she is still on a ventilator			1
they believe she will eventually be able to live at home and lead a normal life			2
' we feel like she 's reborn , ' said @entity8 's father , @entity54			1
' they hope that she can do everything that a normal child can do but it 's going to take time			0
this is a brand new road that all of us are on			0
' he added : ' this is her only chance but she 's got a fantastic one and an unbelievable one			0
' @entity54 choked up and his wife , @entity68 , was teary - eyed at a hospital news conference today			0
@entity8 did not attend because she is still recovering from the surgery			2
she developed an infection after the operation but now is acting like a healthy two - year - old , her doctors said			2
miracle : @entity8 , 2 , pictured with her parents @entity68 - mi and @entity54 at @entity77 in @entity16 , @entity9 , piror to the breakthrough surgery @entity54 said he hopes the family can bring @entity8 home for the first time in a month or so			1
@entity8 turns three in august			2
' it 's going to be amazing for us to finally be together as a family of four , ' he said			0
the couple has an older daughter			0
only about one in 50,000 children worldwide are born with the windpipe defect			0
the stem - cell technique has been used to make other body parts besides windpipes and holds promise for treating other birth defects and childhood diseases , her doctors said			2
the operation brought together an @entity98 surgeon based in @entity99 who pioneered the technique , a pediatric surgeon at @entity39 in @entity40 who met @entity8 's family while on a business trip to @entity9 , and @entity8 — born to a @entity106 man and @entity9 woman who married after he moved to that country to teach @entity109			1
@entity8 's parents had read about dr. @entity112 's success using stem - cell based tracheas but could n't afford to pay for the operation at his center , the @entity117 in @entity118			1
breakthrough : surgeons perform a landmark windpipe transplant operation on @entity8 , 2 , at @entity39 in @entity40 on april 9 , 2013 so dr. @entity122 helped the family arrange to have the procedure at his @entity40 hospital , bringing in @entity112 to lead the operation			1
@entity12 waived the cost , likely hundreds of thousands of dollars , @entity122 said			0
part of @entity39 , the @entity130 hospital considers the operation part of their mission to provide charity care , but also views it as a way to champion a type of stem - cell therapy that does n't involve human embryos , the surgeons said			2
the @entity130 opposes using stem cells derived from human embryos in research or treatment			1
@entity112 has been involved in 14 previous windpipe operations using patients ' own stem cells — five using man - made scaffolds like @entity8 's but in adults ; and nine using scaffolds made from cadaver windpipes , including one in a 10 - year - old @entity153 boy			1
he said only one patient died , a 30 - year - old man from @entity156 , @entity157 , who had the operation in november 2011 to treat late - stage cancer of the windpipe			0
he died about four months later of uncertain causes , @entity112 said			0
brave : the little girl is recovering with her parents , left , after the nine - hour surgery on april 9 similar methods have been used to grow bladders , urethras and last year a girl in @entity99 got a lab - made vein using her own stem cells and a cadaver vein			1
scientists hope to eventually use the method to create solid organs , including kidneys and livers , said dr. @entity179 , director of @entity181 's @entity180			0
he said the operation on @entity8 ' is really showing that the technique is workable			0
' @entity8 had breathing difficulties at birth and @entity9 doctors soon discovered the missing windpipe			1
they reconfigured her esophagus so that a breathing tube could go down it from her mouth to her lungs			0
the esophagus normally runs behind the windpipe and carries food to the stomach			0
@entity9 doctors said she could n't live long with the tube and told her parents there was nothing more they could do			1
@entity8 outlived their expectations and has thrived despite the grim prognosis and other abnormalities including an undeveloped voice box that prevented her from speaking			0
tears of joy : @entity54 and his wife , @entity68 , tearfully stand on tuesday april 30 , 2013 , after being introduced at a press conference in at @entity12 of @entity13 , in @entity40 , @entity13 doctors : dr. @entity112 , center , holds a replica of a windpipe like that implanted in little @entity8 at a news conference today now that she has a windpipe and can breathe more normally , doctors expect the larynx to grow and function normally			1
she will work with speech therapists to help her learn to talk			0
@entity122 said @entity8 will likely need a new windpipe in about five years , as she grows			2
she breathes with help from a ventilator but no longer has a tube in her mouth that she 'd lived with since shortly after birth , @entity122 said			0
she 's not yet able to eat normally , but doctors let her have her first taste ever of food — a few licks on a lollipop			2
her father said she already has discriminating taste and prefers chocolate @entity9 lollipops to the @entity234 kind			0
' i asked her , " is it good ? " ' he said , ' and she immediately nodded her head			0

@entity8 was born without a windpipe in 2010 and has been unable to breathe , eat , drink or swallow on her own since then
doctors in her home country of @entity9 told her parents that she would n't live
stem cells from @entity8 's bone marrow took less than a week to multiply and were created into the windpipe
the pipe , *resembling* a 3 - inch tube of penne pasta , was implanted in a nine - hour surgery at the @entity12 of @entity13 on april 9
