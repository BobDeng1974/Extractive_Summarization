@entity1 midfielder @entity0 may need surgery on a toe he broke in the last game of last season and is in danger of missing the start of pre-season under new manager @entity9			1
the @entity11 captain will see a specialist this week and if he requires an operation to correct the injury he is likely to be out for at least a month			2
any absence would be another blow for the 30 - year - old who only returned to first team action at the turn of the year after a lengthy lay - off due to a bowel problem			0
under the knife ? @entity0 could miss @entity1 's pre-season if he needs surgery for a broken toe he is desperate to get a full close season of preparation under his belt after making a full recovery from ulcerative colitis which had threatened to end his career and troubled him for more than two years			1
@entity0 made 12 appearances after his return in december , including the 1 - 1 final day draw at @entity37			0
he started and finished the game and was only made aware of the broken toe after the game			0
@entity1 medical staff and doctors decided the injury did not need surgery initially but the toe has been slow to heal properly and the club and player want a fresh opinion to decide if an operation is now necessary			0
got guts ! @entity0 made 12 appearances last season after recovering from a bowel condition			1
