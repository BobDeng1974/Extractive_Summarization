a retired teacher was sent an @entity2 bill after he received hospital treatment in @entity4 – because he lived in @entity5			1
@entity6 , 64 , was taken ill while visiting relatives in @entity8 in december			1
he was stunned when staff at @entity10 , near @entity11 , said he would be getting a bill for almost £ 2,000 in the post because he was ‘ technically a foreigner ’			2
@entity6 , 64 , from north @entity5 , was taken ill while visiting relatives in @entity8			1
after a three - day stay at @entity10 he was sent a bill for £ 1,775 because he was classed as a ' foreigner ' the hospital have since apologised , and claim they explained to mr @entity6 that he could pass the bill on to his gp so they could arrange for it to be paid by the local health board			1
however last week mr @entity6 was shocked when he received an ‘ unsettling ’ demand in the post saying that the £ 1,775 bill was overdue			1
‘ it was very stressful , ’ he said , adding : ‘ i ’ve worked for 40 - plus years and always paid my taxes , so to be suddenly told that i was going to be charged for treatment on the @entity2 was shocking			0
’ @entity10 has admitted that the invoice was sent to mr @entity6 in error and should have been sent to his local health authority mr @entity6 , who lives in the village of @entity32 in @entity33 , fell ill while visiting relatives shortly before @entity35 and spent three days undergoing tests at @entity10 – the first @entity2 hospital to be run by a private company			1

moments before the procedure in january , mr @entity6 claims he was ushered into a side room by an administrator and told he would be sent a bill for the examination and his previous stay			2
the father - of - two said : ‘ she said that because i lived in @entity5 i was technically a foreigner and would be sent a bill – my wife nearly fell off her chair			0
for them to have been talking to me about payment moments before they took me for treatment was totally wrong			0
’ a few weeks after the procedure , which found he was suffering from a hernia , mr @entity6 received a bill for £ 1,775 – marked ‘ important ’			1
initially he ‘ did n’t worry too much ’ as his gp had told him that the health board would deal with the invoice , so he simply passed it onto his surgery			2

a spokesman for @entity71 denied referring to mr @entity6 as a ‘ foreigner ’ and claimed they sent him the invoice at the request of his gp surgery			2
they added : ‘ we agreed with the @entity20 that we would send the invoice directly to the patient , and he would pass it on to the practice			0
