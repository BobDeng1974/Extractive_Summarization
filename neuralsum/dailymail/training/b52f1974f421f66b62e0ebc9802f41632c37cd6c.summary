by @entity0 published : 12:09 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 19:42 est , 15 november 2013 a former @entity1 has broken his own record for @entity5 's deepest ever freedive			2
in a competition in the @entity8 , @entity6 , 42 , swam to a depth of 328ft ( 100m ) using only a fin on his feet for propulsion and a rope to make sure he stayed in a straight line			1
the dive was deeper than the height of the @entity17 , otherwise known as @entity17 , and meant @entity18 held his breath for nearly three minutes			1
@entity20 , 42 , originally from @entity21 , has broken his own freediving record by reaching a depth of 328ft ( 100m ) using only a fin on his feet and a rope to keep him in a straight line during the dive board 's lungs would have been crushed to a quarter of their normal size , which made him black out on a previous attempt just a few days beforehand during the dive @entity20 held his breath for nearly three minutes			1
on land the former @entity37 can hold his breath for six minutes and 32 seconds at that depth the air in his lungs would have become compressed , crushing them to a quarter of their normal size , which can lead to blackouts			1
speaking after the event the freedive instructor said : ' the dive felt good			2
i was obviously apprehensive having blacked out in my previous attempt a few days before but i changed a few things for this dive , took a little less weight down , and had less pre-dive nerves			1
' not everything went right though , my nose - clip was not tight enough and i was losing air on the descent so i almost ran out of equalisation before the bottom and only just made it			0
' however the ascent felt strong , the light was much better which really helped right at the end of the dive when surfacing			2
' the previous record , set by @entity18 in january this year , was 315ft ( 96m )			1
he managed to dive to 100m on that occasion but was disqualified because his nose peg fell off			2
the freedive instructor became interested in the sport while scuba diving and after realising he could hold his breath for longer than his friends @entity18 has actually reached 100m three times before but was disqualified when his nose peg fell off , ruptured an eardrum , and blacked out the freedive instructor now lives in @entity73 in @entity74 with his girlfriend @entity75 who holds the @entity77 record for @entity79 freediving @entity6 , who now runs a diving school in @entity74 with his girlfriend @entity75 ( no relation to the @entity82 ) , became interested in free diving while working as a scuba diving instructor			1
he used to get into contests with his friends to see who could hold their breath the longest and found he was quite good at it			0
so good , in fact , that on the surface he can hold his breath for six minutes and 32 seconds			0
he said : ' i wanted to do more of it and learned to become a freediving instructor			0
i 've been doing if for four - and - a - half - years now			0
' the last freedive records not to be held by @entity6 was 298ft ( 91m ) and held by @entity95 , a geography teacher from @entity96 who set it in 2009			2
the world record holder for free immersion diving is @entity100 , from , @entity77 , which stands at 397ft ( 121m ) , nearly twice the height of @entity102			1
the previous record holder before @entity18 was held by @entity95 , a geography teacher who set it in 2009 the @entity106 freediving competition is an annual competition which takes place at @entity109 , the world 's deepest known blue hole with saltwater the current world record for freediving stands at 121m , nearly twice the height of @entity102 , and was set by @entity100 , from , @entity77 @entity20 's record - breaking dive was his fourth attempt at reaching the 100m mark			1
the @entity119 failed in his first attempt at last 's years @entity106 , where he was disqualified for taking too long to complete the necessary surface protocol			0
his second try was this year at the world championships in @entity125 where he had trouble equalising and ruptured his eardrum , which took eight weeks to heal			0
his third attempt , a couple of days before his record - setting dive , saw him suffer a small blackout on the surface , before eventually succeeding with his forth			1
the former @entity37 says he spends most of the year in @entity73 in @entity74 where he runs the @entity136 school with @entity75 , who holds the @entity77 record for @entity79 freediving			0
he added : ' i have my own 25m pool there and unlimited depth but it is open water diving so conditions are not always ideal like here in the @entity147			0
' however it does allow me to maintain dive fitness and flexibility throughout the year			0

@entity6 , 42 , originally from @entity21 , broke his own record
at 328ft his dive was deeper than the height of @entity17
his lungs were crushed to a quarter of their regular size
he blacked out on a previous attempt just days before
world record stands a 121m , twice the height of @entity102
