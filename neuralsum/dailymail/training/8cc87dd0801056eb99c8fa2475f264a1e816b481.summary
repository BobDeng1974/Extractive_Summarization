police in @entity2 are investigating whether a 13 - year - old boy thought to have murdered his police officer parents , his grandmother and his great - aunt was actually the fifth victim of a massacre carried out by criminal cops who wanted his mother dead , it was reported today			1
schoolboy @entity11 had been named as the only suspect in the horrific family bloodbath after it appeared he shot each victim in the head early monday morning at their home in @entity19			1
in a tragedy which has shocked @entity2 , the teenager then spent a normal full day at school , before returning home where he apparently killed himself			1
it is believed she may have been targeted because she was a police informant but doubt has now been cast on the police 's version of events after it was revealed @entity11 's mother , @entity37 , 36 , had been involved in turning over criminal cops in the months leading up to her violent death			1
col @entity41 , commander of the 18th @entity42 where ms @entity37 worked , told a radio station that the policewoman had passed on information about officers who were allegedly stealing money from bank cash machines			0
he added that she had provided details about various colleagues suspected of being part of a criminal gang within the police force , which had led to them being removed from their duties			1
and he added that he had doubts about the involvement of @entity11 in the massacre , who has been described as a quiet boy who loved his parents and never as much as got into a fight at school			1
col @entity41 told @entity66 : ' she never exactly said , that one , that one and that one			0
but , in the context of our investigations , she confirmed a number of details			0
' @entity74 footage from a security camera shows @entity11 casually walking to school in the early hours of monday morning he said none of those accused had been charged with a crime because the investigation was still ongoing			1
but he said policemen suspected of being involved in the robberies had been transferred to other police departments : ' those ones , we removed them from the picture , those who were supposed to be part of the ' group ' inside the battalion			2
' col @entity41 called on investigators into the family 's murder not to ' rule out ' the hypothesis that @entity11 might have been framed by criminal policemen who wanted his mother dead			1
he said : ' let 's not throw it out , let 's look at things carefully , lets see if there is reasoning in what we already have , if the pieces of the puzzle really do fit together			2
' police chief @entity107 , in charge of investigations into the massacre , said he would look into col @entity41 's accusations , but insisted that they ' would n't alter the direction of the investigation			2
' police believe that @entity11 murdered his family at their home in the northern @entity19 district of @entity119 in an overnight massacre beginning on sunday night and continuing into the early hours of monday			1
he then stole his mother 's care and calmly drove it to school , where he waited for five hours before lessons started			1
after getting a lift back home at the end of the day by the father of a schoolmate , investigators believe he stroked his dead mother 's hair before shooting himself in the head			1
his father , @entity134 , 40 , a police sergeant with 19 - years service , was found in bed			0

@entity176 , mrs @entity166 's brother , said he did not believe the boy had the strength to lift and fire the hefty .40 calibre weapon			1
he said : ' it makes no sense			0
this is a heavy gun and he could n't have had the strength to shoot it '			0
and @entity11 's cousin , @entity184 , said : ' if it was a @entity11 who did it , then it was a force of evil			0
he was a boy who was loving and loved by all			0
