by @entity0 last updated at 5:17 pm on 8th december 2011 less than a year after their father was jailed after pleading guilty to sexually abusing his daughters , members of the 5 @entity2 have spoken about their ordeal and the life - long scars it has left them with			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 appeared on the today show in the hope they will inspire other victims of abuse to come forward and to ultimately have the @entity17 for child abuse changed , so there are no time restrictions for victims to come forward			1
daughter @entity22 , who was also abused at her father 's hands , chose not to appear on the show			1
they were the first family of five siblings to be accepted at the same time into @entity46 ’s @entity45			2
the @entity48 siblings released three albums that got to number one in the @entity51 classical chart			0
the @entity52 described them as ‘ the biggest classical music sensation in years ’			2
@entity54 said they are ‘ button - down cute and somewhat otherworldly ’			0
they have performances coming up in @entity46 , @entity56 and @entity57 in november - before going to @entity58 in december			0
when asked what made them want to speak out after they initially tried to hide the story from the media , @entity27 said : ' i think we want to reach out to people and want to change the laws and @entity17 so there are none for victims of childhood sex abuse			1
' sex abuse within families is so rampant and we want to speak out so people are not ashamed any more			2
the more people who are aware , the less it will happen			0
' i think abusers make you feel like you should n't tell anyone , they make you embarrassed			0
' @entity9 said : ' we 've been really blessed to have had the support to get through all this and to be able to speak about these horrible things			1
' their brother @entity11 revealed that as well as the actual victims , the abuse affects the whole family			1
he said : ' people do n't realise how many other people it affects			0
but it was important for me to be there for them			0
it was really a cut and dry situation - you support the victims not the perpetrator			2
' the 5 @entity2 are a @entity48 piano - playing group consisting of three sisters and two brothers			1
they have set up @entity104 to help those victims come forward and offer support			1
@entity107 assaulted : the @entity11 daughters only wanted to see their father jailed for a certain amount of time they are also hoping to get the backing of some senators to change the @entity17 so that a child does not have to come out about the abuse when they are still living under the same roof as their attacker			1
@entity9 said : ' there will be life long scars from abuse suffered and hopefully a child of that age will be able to find that support they need , whether it 's within the home or a foundation or something they can reach towards and find what they need			1
' the @entity11 daughters kept the abuse a secret for years , even from each other , until 2007 when they were discussing separate issues and it came up			1
@entity27 explains how they broached the issue with their parents to try to deal with it discretely : ' we approached my father and mother and thought we could deal with it in the family and for him to take full accountability and show extreme remorse			0
but unfortunately that was lacking in our situation			0
' when he heard he wanted to manage other children , it boiled down to , " if he does n't go to prison he could do this to someone else "			2
the situation has made the five of us closer than ever			0
' unity : sisters @entity27 , left , and @entity9 kept the abuse a secret for years , even from each other brother : @entity11 said it is not just the actual victims who are affected but the whole family @entity34 was sentenced to spend ten years to life in prison for the abuse of his daughters after he pleaded guilty in february to one felony count of sodomy and two felony counts of sexual abuse			1
judge @entity175 sentenced the 55 - year - old to ten years to life on the first count , and 15 years to life for each of the others			2
he said @entity11 was a ' danger to society ' but was given a lighter sentence by the consent of his victims			2
his crimes were close to being kept a secret from the public and were only uncovered by the media following a car accident near @entity192 that he was involved in just days after he was charged			0
@entity11 drove his @entity193 off a road and it fell 300ft into the @entity195 as he returned from a ski resort on @entity197 with his wife - with police saying he was travelling too fast			0
