his role will be expanded to include responsibility for the @entity18 following publication of the @entity21 report			2
@entity3 's conduct as chairman of @entity24 was today described as ' ill - judged ' by @entity21 mr @entity3 was heavily criticised in the report , with his record in the @entity27 attacked by media regulator @entity21			1
@entity4 was cleared to continue airing programmes , as @entity21 today said @entity24 remained a ‘ fit and proper ’ broadcaster despite the phone - hacking scandal			1
it found no evidence that @entity4 was directly or indirectly involved in any of the wrongdoing either admitted or alleged			0
@entity24 has been cleared as a ' fit and proper ' broadcaster despite its parent company being embroiled in the phone hacking scandal @entity37 ’s @entity10 owns a 39 per cent stake in @entity24			1
@entity10 had hoped to buy the rest of @entity24 but was forced to drop its bid as the phone hacking scandal erupted			0
the review was launched last year after @entity43 , also owned by @entity10 , was forced to close the @entity44 after a wave of allegations of phone hacking at the sunday tabloid newspaper			0
@entity3 was chief executive of @entity43 and chairman of @entity24 when the scandal erupted			1
he remains a non-executive director at @entity4 and an executive director at @entity10 @entity21 said his failure to get to the bottom of the allegations sooner was ‘ difficult to comprehend and ill - judged '			1
but it said there was no evidence that @entity3 knew of widespread wrongdoing or that he was complicit in a cover - up			0
@entity4 welcomed the licence decision today , insisting it was ‘ committed to high standards of governance ’			0
‘ as @entity21 acknowledges , our track record of compliance in broadcasting is good , ’ the firm said in a statement			0
but @entity21 was critical of @entity3 ’s failure to act			2
it said : ‘ we consider @entity3 ’s conduct , including his failure to initiate action on his own account on a number of occasions , to be both difficult to comprehend and ill - judged			2
' he was not involved with @entity43 until the end of 2007 , almost a year after the sentencing of @entity44 's royal editor @entity76 and private investigator @entity77 for phone hacking			0
but after he took over as chief executive , he received an email suggesting that criminal activities were more widespread , although he claimed he failed to read the correspondence fully			0
@entity37 dropped his bid to buy @entity24 outright in the wake of allegations about phone hacking @entity21 added : ' we consider that the events set out above raise questions regarding @entity3 's competence in the handling of these matters and his attitude towards the possibility of wrongdoing in the companies for which he was responsible			1
' @entity21 said its duty to be satisfied that a licensee is fit and proper is ongoing			2
' should further relevant evidence become available in the future , @entity21 would need to consider that evidence in order to fulfil its duty			0
' in july 2011 , @entity21 announced it had a duty to investigate whether @entity4 was fit and proper to continue to hold its broadcast licences , in light of allegations about phone hacking			1
in a statement today the regulator said : ' @entity21 considers that , on the evidence currently available and having taken into account all the relevant factors , @entity4 is fit and proper to hold its broadcast licences			2
' @entity114 , @entity115 's shadow culture secretary , said : ' while @entity21 has found @entity4 is fit and proper to hold a broadcasting licence , its criticisms of @entity3 are damning			1
' his continued presence on @entity4 ’s board casts a shadow over one of our most important national broadcasters			0
' @entity3 and @entity37 give evidence to the @entity124 last july in march @entity3 wrote to the @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 to apologise for his conduct			0
he conceded he should have ' asked more questions , requested more documents and taken a more challenging and sceptical view of what i was told			0
' @entity115 mp @entity134 , a leading critic of the @entity3 empire , said he was ' disappointed but not surprised ' by @entity21 's ruling			1
mr @entity134 said : ' i do think it shows the flaws in @entity21 methodology			2
they can not do deep investigations in the way that other organisations can			0
' they also do hedge their bets , they say that the test can be applied at any time if there is new evidence , and were also critical of @entity3 where they say his conduct was n’t that becoming of a chairman or a chief executive			0
so they ’re not entirely cleared by the report			0
' mr @entity134 also suggested there could be more revelations in the future which could reopen the question of the @entity3 empire 's governance			1
' i think the share arrangements of @entity10 that ’s two tiered and effectively means that @entity37 and his family effectively control the entire organisation , will ultimately come back and haunt both him and @entity3			0
' i think there ’ll be more revelations in the years to come that mean that @entity21 might have to apply that fit and proper person test in the near future and they might be regretting this report today			1
' @entity10 welcomed @entity21 's decision but defended @entity3 , saying he deserved credit for leading @entity4 to its outstanding record as a broadcaster			1
it said in a statement : ' we are pleased that @entity21 recognises @entity24 as a fit and proper holder of a broadcast licence and remain proud of both @entity10 's and @entity3 's distinguished record in facilitating the transformation of @entity4 into @entity27 's leading pay television and home communications provider			1
' we disagree , however , with certain of the report 's statements about @entity3 's prior actions as an executive and director , which are not at all substantiated by evidence			2

watchdog says it is ' difficult to comprehend ' why @entity3 did not investigate hacking claims sooner
@entity24 cleared as a ' fit and proper ' broadcaster
@entity115 's @entity134 says further revelations are likely and @entity21 will ' regret ' its report
