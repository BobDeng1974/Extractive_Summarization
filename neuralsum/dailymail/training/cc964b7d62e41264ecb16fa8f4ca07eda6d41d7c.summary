judge @entity0 has blasted the @entity1 for handing out 170 bogus workers border chiefs have been blasted for ‘ catastrophic ’ failures over a £ 500,000 scam that allowed more than 170 bogus @entity7 workers and their relatives to illegally enter @entity9			1
a senior judge branded it a ‘ scandal ’ that the discredited @entity1 had handed out so many work permits to a company which even its own inspector warned was a front for a massive immigration racket			1
the firm , @entity18 , claimed it had lucrative it contracts with private and public sector giants including @entity21 , @entity22 and the @entity23 – even though a single phone call would have exposed this as a fraud			2
bosses told officials that they needed staff from their sister firm in @entity31 , @entity7 , to work in highly - skilled £ 40,000 - a - year jobs at their plant in @entity34			1
but many of those who travelled to the @entity9 on false pretences actually got jobs in fast food restaurants and stacking shelves in supermarkets			0
in a highly unusual move , the judge hauled a senior border official into court to explain the scandal and accused the @entity46 of attempting to cover up the fiasco to ‘ spare their blushes ’			1
it is the second time in a week that the now - defunct @entity1 has been condemned by the courts over shocking failures			1
last thursday , a vicar suspected of running @entity9 ’s biggest sham marriage racket walked free last week after his £ 1million trial dramatically collapsed as a result of ‘ serious misconduct ’ by the former @entity46 agency			2
two disgraced public servants , since suspended from duty , are facing criminal charges themselves after the case of @entity65 - born clergyman reverend @entity64 , 54 , was thrown out of court			0
the latest criticism from the judiciary is a huge embarrassment for the @entity46 and raises urgent questions about the state of the nation ’s beleaguered immigration controls			2
he said : ‘ it is a scandal that no one checked with the organisations that were supposedly contracting with @entity18 @entity9			2
many of them were in the public sector			0
it would have been so easy but everything was just taken on the nod			0
‘ the applications kept coming time and time again			0
this was a company apparently growing exponentially and no one thought : “ hang on ”			0
’ home secretary @entity92 brought the under - fire @entity1 back under the government 's control incredibly , a @entity1 official who visited the @entity31 office placed the company on a ‘ watchlist ’ because he feared it was a front for an immigration racket			1
but staff who were responsible for overseeing permits for @entity18 @entity9 were never alerted			2
the judge said : ‘ [ the inspector ] went to the @entity31 office and realised there was something seriously wrong , that this company was going to lose half its workforce to the @entity9 and there did n’t even appear to be that number of people there go start with			1
’ ‘ why when the company was placed on a so - called watchlist did no one bother to tell the case workers ? ’ @entity18 @entity9 was set up by @entity7 nationals @entity118 , 42 , and @entity119 , 35 , both of @entity34 , supposedly to contract it work for other firms , @entity116 @entity115 was told			2
the pair submitted letters and emails to the @entity46 claiming ‘ partnerships ’ with organisations including the @entity23 , @entity21 and @entity128			0
in fact , this so - called proof was actually welcome messages they had received for signing up to services on those companies ’ websites and the contracts did not exist			0
despite this , the company was classified as ‘ low - risk ’ by the @entity46 and awarded a licence to grant certificates of sponsorship – a significant step in someone being awarded a work permit			2
between 2009 and 2012 , the @entity1 handed out 117 certificates to @entity18 @entity9			1
this led to 55 three - year visas being issued to people travelling from @entity7 supposedly to work for the loss - making company			2
prosecutors estimated that more than 120 family members were also granted visas to join them – making a total of at least 175 @entity7 nationals brought here illegally			0
@entity1 officials made two visits to the company ’s offices in @entity34 and one to the plant in @entity31 , @entity7 , but no - one verified the existence of the supposedly lucrative it contracts			1
@entity118 and @entity119 , the company directors , are estimated to have made at least £ 500,000 between them by selling the work permits for up to £ 4,500 each			1
border chiefs have been blasted for ‘ catastrophic ’ failures over a £ 500,000 scam that allowed more than 170 bogus @entity7 workers and their relatives to illegally enter @entity9 the pair may have got away with their duplicity had it not been for a separate tax investigation by @entity175 which uncovered the scam			1
judge @entity0 also criticised the @entity46 for failing to disclose vital information to the prosecution until the last day of the trial – jeopardising the entire case			1
he said : ‘ whether it was to spare blushes or simply as a means of efficiency i do n’t know			0
’ the @entity1 ’s head of sponsorship unit , @entity187 , was hauled into the witness box to explain the debacle			1
he said the unit had ‘ tightened up its checks ’ on companies			0
@entity118 was jailed for six years for fraud and money laundering and @entity119 was imprisoned for six - and - a - half years			0
the judge said : ‘ you sought what was a wholly fraudulent application for a licence to grant sponsorship agreements , so that people who would not otherwise be entitled to enter the @entity9 would come in to the @entity9 and inevitably were able to stay here after			0
this was about making money			0
’ the @entity1 , which was axed last year after a series of scandals and replaced with @entity206			1
the @entity207 was created after being hived off from the agency in 2012 .			0
