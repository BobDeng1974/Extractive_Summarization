by @entity0 would you class yourself as a night owl or more of a morning person ? be careful how you answer because it could give clues to your personality traits			1
@entity9 researchers have discovered that a preference for staying up late or into the early hours has a direct link to anti-social behaviour and so - called @entity14 traits			1
the @entity14 traits consist of narcissistic and selfish actions , cunning or deceitful machiavellian behaviour and psychopathic tendencies			1
@entity9 researchers have found a direct link between night owls , people who stay awake into the early hours , and narcissistic or psychopathic behaviour			1
these behaviours form what 's called the @entity14 of personality traits and the study claims people who prefer evenings to mornings are more anti-social the @entity14 is a group of three personality traits : narcissism , machiavellianism and psychopathy			1
the narcissistic personality is characterised by a ' grandiose self - view , a sense of entitlement , lack of empathy , and egotism			2
the machiavellian personality is characterised by manipulation and exploitation of others , with a disregard for morality and a focus on self - interest and deception			0
a psychopathic personality is characterised by thrill - seeking , selfishness , callousness , lack of personal affect , superficial charm , and remorselessness			0
the paper from dr @entity56 from the @entity57 surveyed 263 students online			0
the average age was 24 and there were 74 men and 189 women involved			0
participants were asked about their chronotype			0
a person 's chronotype reflects at what time of the day their hormone levels , temperature , brain function , eating and sleeping are most active , change or reach a certain level			0
people who are more active and feel more alert in the morning are referred to as ' larks ' , while people who prefer late evening hours are classed as ' owls '			2
questions included , ' during the first half hour after you wake up in the morning , how do you feel ? ' people were then rated based on a narcissism scale and were asked how strongly they agreed with statements including ' i have a natural talent for influencing people			2
' future studies are being planned to look at whether larks , people who function best in the morning , portray certain behaviour types as well , in a bid to see whether bodies actually do function at different times of the day , or whether people just perceive that they do they were additionally asked how they felt about statements made on the psychopathy scale , for example , ' i think i could beat a lie detector ' , and a machiavellian scale , such as ' it is hard to get ahead without cutting corners here and there '			2
across the 263 students , the darker a participant 's personality score , the more they tended to be an ' owl ' and said they functioned more effectively in the evening hours			0
people who feel more active and alert in the morning are referred to as ' larks ' , while people who prefer late evening hours are classed as ' owls ' this was also the case when the three traits were analysed separately ; each trait was stronger in people who considered themselves to be night owls			1
the paper claims the results are consistent with a ' niche - specialisation ' hypothesis			0
niche specialisation is the process where traits have developed over time , through evolution			0
dr @entity56 said in the study : ' it could be adaptively effective for anyone pursuing a fast life strategy like that embodied in the @entity14 to occupy and exploit a low - light environment where others are sleeping and having diminished cognitive functioning			1
such features of the night may facilitate the causal sex , mate - poaching , and risk - taking the @entity14 traits are linked to			1
' for example , humans and animals may have evolved to be night owls because the low - light conditions made it possible to carry out these behaviours and actions without being seen			1
dr @entity56 concludes that more work is needed , but the results highlight an important step in the study of the darker aspects of human nature			0
future studies are being planned to look at whether larks portray certain behaviour types , in a bid to see whether bodies actually do function at different times of the day , or whether people just perceive that they do .			2

researchers find a link between night owls and anti-social behaviour
people who prefer low - light conditions have higher @entity14 traits
the @entity14 includes narcissism , machiavellianism and psychopathy
future study plans to see if morning people , larks , share personality traits
