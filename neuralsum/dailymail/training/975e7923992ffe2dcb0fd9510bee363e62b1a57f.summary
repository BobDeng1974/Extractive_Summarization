@entity5 ’s mother , @entity40 , said : ' i understand that the school does have rules and regulations			1
the problem is i ’ve never heard of this one			0

ms @entity5 said her daughter was stopped at the gate and told to remove the yellow flower she had worn for a year to show her support ms @entity5 said her daughter was stopped at the gate and told to remove the yellow flower she had worn for a year to show her support			1
after she refused to remove the badge , she was excluded for ' refusing a reasonable request '			1
ms @entity5 said she has since had two meetings with the school but is still unclear when she can return and why she suddenly was n't allowed to wear the badge she had worn for a year			1
ms @entity5 , of @entity7 , said : ' it is just a small , little yellow flower , it has been there for a year and is the only badge she wears on a her black blazer			1
' @entity5 asked the teacher if she could work in seclusion but with the badge on but he would n't have it			2
he wanted her to put it on her bag , that seems to be to only reasonable way			0
' now there is no sign of her going back to school unless she removed the badge			2
' the choice has always been hers , i know she would take it off if i asked her but i would n't ask her to do that outside school and i would n't ask her to do it in school			2
' this is simply a 14 - year - old girl who has chosen to promote awareness			0
' @entity6 has defended its decision to suspend pupils for wearing charity badges on their school uniform			1
several pupils were suspended last week for wearing the badges on their blazers			0
the school says pupils are free to wear the badges on their bags and outdoor coats , but not on their blazers			0
a spokesman said in a statement : ' @entity105 has a proud record of supporting charities and encouraging each student to take part in charitable activities			0
our trust actively supports the @entity114 charity amongst others			0
' there are some students who were wearing five or six badges , some that include football , music or fashion , on their lapels and we feel this detracts from the drive to support individual charities			0
' we organise a number of charity events throughout the school year which are highly successful in raising the profile and the importance of many charities			2
' students are given the opportunity to show their support for charities at particular times of the year to coincide with national or international appeals which often includes students wearing a particular badge , poppy , bangle or ribbon			0
' to highlight the importance of these activities we ask that students refrain from wearing them throughout the year ; a poppy , for example would lose its impact if it just became another badge			0
' however we are more than happy for students to wear multiple charity badges on their bags or outside coats as this does not form part of the uniform			0
' ms @entity5 said : ' i think that is ridiculous to say that a poppy loses its importance over a year , the person wearing it just chooses to remember all year round			1
' it does n't make it more important if they just remember for a short period of time			0
' @entity5 wants to remember all year round , every day , every minute			1
she has the opportunity to explain to people this is a @entity10 flower and what it means to her			0
' @entity5 added : ' it makes me feel rather upset , i just wore it to remember my aunt			2
