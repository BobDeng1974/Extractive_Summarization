by @entity0 published : 13:25 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 13:34 est , 14 march 2014 barely three hours into our stay in @entity3 , and we are obsessed			2
not just with all that pickled herring and its alarming tendency to repeat on you			2
or the wonderful restaurants and dark bread and handsome architecture and the very attractive men			1
or even the alarming number of gigantic , wiry red beards bobbing about the streets			2
apparently big , red beards are all the rage at the moment , which is serendipitous for the @entity19 ’s new @entity18 exhibition which opened in @entity20 this month			1
no , our obsession is a little shallower			2
drama : picturesque @entity3 felt like a huge movie set for @entity26 - drama fan @entity0 because , if you ’ve watched as many @entity29 box - sets as my husband and i — three series of @entity33 , two of @entity35 and two of @entity37 , for starters — @entity3 is one enormous film set			1
everywhere you look , it ’s familiar			2
the @entity42 buildings , where @entity35 ’s prime minister @entity44 click - clacks about in very tight suits and shiny heels , negotiating like mad with the @entity47 , or the @entity48 , or whoever it is this week			1
there are the docks , bound to be overflowing with murder victims			2
and the bridge to @entity53 which @entity37 detectives @entity55 and @entity56 whizz over every ten minutes in their quest for national security in both @entity29 and @entity53			1
sadly , we never quite made it to the five - mile long @entity62 — we were planning on taking the train to @entity64 while we alternately sang the haunting theme music to @entity37 and said ‘ tak ’ ( @entity29 for ‘ thank you ’ ) to each other , but for some reason we just could n’t leave the opulent splendour of the brilliantly luxurious @entity71			1
( i have never stayed in a hotel room with quite so many soft towels or @entity76 products )			0
famous locals : the @entity29 city is the backdrop to popular tv dramas @entity37 , featuring detectives @entity80 and @entity37 ( l ) and @entity33 whose main character @entity33 ( r ) has become a global style icon tense : popular show @entity35 follows the political dramas of ( l - r ) @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 over the past few years , @entity3 , @entity29 and indeed , pretty much everything @entity91 ( apart from perhaps their 22 million intensively farmed pigs ) , has become super cool			1
they boast @entity96 and @entity97 — two of the best ( and most expensive ) restaurants in the world , amazing social welfare ( thanks to astronomical taxes ) , endless happiness ( @entity29 routinely come out top on global happiness surveys — although worryingly , they ’re also in second place for the number of anti-depressants consumed per capita ) , fabulously stylish design , @entity110 and , more recently , the slew of tv drama series that have taken us all by storm			1
even their royal family is cool			0
queen @entity120 ( who ’s been on the throne since 1972 ) studied at @entity123 , the @entity124 and the @entity125 , speaks @entity29 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity53 and @entity119 , is an accomplished painter and fashion designer and , aged 73 , is a committed chain smoker — though not in public any more			1
award - winning : @entity3 restaurant @entity96 is often hailed as one of the world 's best the shops ( particularly @entity134 — a bit like @entity136 , but calmer , sleeker and more stylish ) are quirky and eclectic , and full of things you desperately want to buy , should n’t because the exchange rate is n’t great and then do anyway			1
such as my husband ’s new ( very slim - fitted ) shirt covered in daisies			1
and the enormous industrial - style pendant lights we ordered as soon as we got home			1
and the three vast loaves of the world ’s best ( and probably most expensive ) sourdough bread from the @entity150 on @entity151 ( owned by @entity152 of @entity96 ) which we rammed into our hand luggage and have been eating ever since			1
the @entity29 are big on cosiness — or @entity155 , as they call it			1
they ’re the masters of attractive ambience — candles , wonderful lighting , pleasing lines and smooth wood , even in @entity163 ’s			0
given time was short over a weekend , we spent it mostly being ‘ cosy ’			0
from the launchpad of our incredibly central hotel , we concentrated our efforts in an array of cafes , wine bars ( particularly the brilliant @entity172 10 , near @entity173 ) , restaurants and , thanks to visiting in the middle of the ‘ @entity3 jazz and art festival ’ , experienced @entity29 ‘ supergroup ’ , the @entity180 ( surprisingly good ) and the truly wonderful @entity29 pianist @entity181			1
harbour view : @entity183 is part of the city 's ' masculine and pleasing ' architecture even my husband — who with a name like @entity190 knows his jazz — was impressed			1
so impressed ( and refreshed , courtesy of the @entity172 wine bar ) that he did n’t notice when the lovely waitress at the @entity195 accidentally charged us for someone else ’s dinner			0
‘ it seems a bit expensive			0
everyone knows @entity3 ’s not cheap , but £ 76 for two glasses of red wine			0
’ and it is expensive			0
but it ’s worth it			0
and the best thing about it is that , while it ’s all lovely and stylish , it ’s not that super-sleek @entity212 stylishness where you end up feeling dowdy and lumpy by comparison			0
it ’s far more accessible			0
the architecture is masculine and pleasing , without being twee			0
the people are attractive ( particularly , it turns out , the red - bearded @entity18 crew ) , but not ridiculously so			2
and joy of joys , they drink enthusiastically , smoke like chimneys ( perhaps the reason they have the highest cancer rates on the planet ) dance badly and are highly cultured			0
this is , after all , a people who , back in the dark ages ironed their clothes , combed their hair and scooped wax from their ears with specially designed spoons			0
scene of the crime : the imposing @entity62 between @entity29 and @entity53 unlike @entity212 , you can actually imagine living among them , fancying them , them fancying you			1
it helps , of course , that they all speak @entity117 better than we do and are incredibly friendly			0
our last ( herring - free ) morning was spent mostly making a list of all the things we ’d do the next time we come — hug the @entity247 , potter around the @entity249 ( closed in winter ) , visit the extraordinarily beautiful old @entity251 building , have dinner in the brilliantly bouncy @entity253 on @entity254 — and gushing to our taxi driver @entity255 about how brilliant all the @entity29 murder tv series are			1
‘ it ’s always good to be good at something , ’ he says			2
‘ and murder ’s as good as anything , is n’t it ? but here we mostly watch @entity263 and @entity264 — that ’s a very good programme			2
you should watch it some time			0
’ picture perfect : pretty painted houses line the @entity269 canal @entity270 ( 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com ) flies to @entity3 from @entity271 , from £ 104 return			0
double rooms at the @entity71 , dangleterre.dk start at £ 392 room only .			0

the @entity29 city is the backdrop to @entity35 , @entity37 and @entity33
good - looking locals are big on ' *hygge* ' ( cosiness )
restaurants @entity96 and @entity97 often named best in the world
