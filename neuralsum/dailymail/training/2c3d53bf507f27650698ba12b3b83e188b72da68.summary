the high - profile murder trial of dr. @entity0 , 72 , has been underway for almost six weeks , during which time the jury has heard from a plethora of former employees who have shared startling stories of the practices they allegedly witnessed			1
he is charged with killing four infants during botched abortions as well as a 41 - year - old woman who died of an overdose after the procedure at his women 's @entity24 clinic in urban @entity8			1
he could face the death penalty if convicted			0
prosecutors said @entity0 ran a clinic where women went for late - term abortions			1
@entity0 's defense lawyer , @entity32 , characterized the prosecution of his client , who is black , as ' elitist , racist ' he added that there is no evidence that the babies were delivered alive , noting ' the first rule of homicide is someone has to be alive '			1
earlier this week , three of eight murder charges were thrown out , apparently because the judge had not heard sufficient evidence that the three babies were viable , born alive and then killed			0
the defense questioned testimony from staffers who said they had seen babies move , cry or breathe			2
@entity32 argued that each testified to seeing only a single movement or breath			0
tragic : he faces a murder charge in the overdose death of @entity54 , left , who died in 2009 scene : a police car is seen outside the the @entity58 in 2011 following @entity0 's arrest ' these are not the movements of a live child , ' @entity32 said			2
' there is not one piece - not one - of objective , scientific evidence that anyone was born alive			0
' the jury will also ponder third - degree murder charges against @entity0 for the 2009 overdose death of 41 - year - old @entity70 , who died after an abortion at his women 's @entity24			1
former staffers have testified that patients received heavy sedatives and painkillers from untrained workers while @entity0 was offsite , and were then left in waiting rooms for hours , often unattended			1
despite that , the workers testified that they had never seen a woman go into distress before @entity70			0
yet a 2011 grand jury report alleges that dozens of women were injured at @entity0 's clinic over the past 30 years , calling it a ‘ house of horrors			1
’ house of horror : a grand jury photograph shows what police say are plastic bags hiding body parts in a refrigerator inside the @entity8 practice operating table : women were often given such high doses of drugs that they gave birth in the toilet mess : the interior of the clinic , which an report noted smelled of cat urine and was splatted with blood some left with torn wombs or bowels , some with venereal disease contracted through the reuse of non-sterilized equipment , and some left with fetal remains still inside them , the report alleged			1
and the report blamed @entity0 for an earlier maternal death that was not charged			2
assistant district attorney @entity121 , in defending the @entity54 charge , said it stemmed from the totality of the circumstances at @entity0 's clinic			2
they included the repeated medication dosages given by medical assistants ; the doctor 's absence during most of her two - day visit ; and the hour it took to open a locked side door and take her by stretcher to an ambulance			0
the prosecutor questioned why else @entity0 and his staff would ' snip ' babies if they were not born alive			2
the brains were intact , so it was not done to make the delivery easier , he said			0
' why would you cut a baby in the back of the neck unless you were killing it ? ' @entity121 argued			0
the doctor : @entity0 charged : @entity150 employee : @entity152 arrested : @entity153 assistant : @entity155 worker : @entity157 accomplice : @entity159 mugshot : @entity161 held : @entity162 @entity0 had also been charged with five counts of abuse of a corpse , for removing the feet from aborted fetuses and storing them in specimen jars			2
@entity32 argued that his client did so to keep dna samples , and @entity171 agreed to dismiss those counts			0
@entity171 upheld charges that @entity0 violated @entity175 's abortion laws by performing abortions after 24 weeks and failing to counsel women 24 hours before the procedure			1
last week , a medical assistant told a jury that she saw one late - term baby who survived an abortion ' swimming ' in a toilet ' trying to get out			1
' @entity185 also claimed she saw the spines of at least 10 babies snipped using scissors during unorthodox late - term abortions at a @entity8 clinic			1
other employees at the clinic also confirmed that babies were often expelled from their mothers into the toilet			2
on at least one occasion the toilet had to be removed from the floor to ' get the fetuses out of the pipes			0
' charged : dr. @entity0 , a @entity8 abortion doctor , is accused of killing 4 babies allegedly born alive many pregnant women were given drugs to induce labor			1
@entity185 , who worked at the clinic from 2005 to 2009 , was so disturbed by its operation that she took photos and called authorities , although she gave a relative 's name			0
@entity212 said ' one or two babies fell out of patients each night			0
they dropped on lounge chairs , on the floor , and often in the toilet			0
' the 2011 grand jury report blasts state and city officials for failing to inspect or shutter @entity0 's busy clinic in @entity8			1
the 300 - page grand jury report , that initially laid out the charges against @entity0 , details the appalling conditions of the @entity8 clinic the doctor operated			1
clinic : when @entity70 fell unconscious , staff took an hour to unlock a side door to get her out , pictured discarded : bags stashed with body parts , pictured , were also found in the @entity8 clinic it was described as reeking of cat urine , with walls splattered with blood and patient rooms filled with unsanitary instruments and broken - down equipment			1
the tiny fetuses and many of their bodyparts were piled high throughout @entity0 ’s clinic in cabinets and freezers , in plastic bags , bottles , even cat - food containers			2
jars with severed feet lined shelves , prosecutors said			0
