a supply teacher has resigned from a primary school after she allegedly put sticky tape over the mouth of a nine year - old child to ' keep her quiet '			1
the teacher , who has not been named , taught at @entity6 in the pretty village of @entity6 , @entity8			1
the incident , which took place earlier this month , was apparently meant as a joke but concerned parents at the school have slammed it as ' worrying ' and ' completely unacceptable '			1
@entity14 in @entity8 ( pictured ) has apologised to the pupil 's parents following the incident the school , which is rated ' good ' by school 's inspectorate @entity17 , has apologised to the girl 's parents and said the matter was investigated and the teacher has now resigned			1
a @entity25 spokesman said : ' a full investigation has taken place and the supply teacher spoken to			1
' although there was no ill intent or unkindness intended , it is clear this incident should not have happened and the member of staff has resigned from their post			2
' we have spoken to the child 's parents and apologised as this fell below the standards we expect			1
' but the incident has left parents concerned			2
one parent , who did not want to be named , said : ' it does n't matter whether it was a joke or not			2
however tempting it is to do something like this it is completely unacceptable and very worrying			1
' @entity51 , a former @entity6 school governor and a district and parish councillor for the village , said she was satisfied with the response from the school			0
she said : ' i have every confidence that the people in charge at @entity6 , the headteacher and the governors , have done whatever was needed to be done and have handled this properly			0
' the teacher has resigned and i would think there is really no further need for any parent to be concerned			2
' however , @entity70 , a former headmaster and chairman of the @entity72 , said the supply teacher should be retrained			1
he said : ' you simply can not do this with children , the incident would have been very damaging to the child			1
' if you feel the need to tape a child 's mouth up you should not be in the profession at all			1
a @entity25 ( pictured ) spokesman said : ' although there was no ill intent or unkindness intended , it is clear this incident should not have happened ' ' the only explanation is that the teacher must have lost control , they must have not been able to cope with the child			2
' saying it was a joke is a feeble excuse			0
you can not inflict that sort of harm as a joke , it is n't a joke for the child			2
' if you are resorting to those tactics you may as well pack it in and go home , and that seems to be what this teacher has done			0
' this is completely inappropriate , it ca n't be allowed to happen			0
the teacher needs to be retrained			0
' @entity110 , director of children 's charity @entity111 , said the act was a form of child abuse			1
she said : ' an affective and properly trained teacher would not use that action			0
children should know there is a time for quiet and a time for speaking and there are ways and means to do that			0
' but putting sticky tape on a child 's mouth can never be seen as acceptable			1
it 's child abuse really			1
the parents of that child should rightfully be up in arms			2
it makes them a laughing stock to their peers			0
' it 's a way of ridiculing the child , it 's a hard - hitting form of bulling			0
it says to the rest of the class that it is acceptable for them to do that so it has a ricochet effect on how that child is treated by their peers			0
' the imbalance of power makes it a very sinister development , it 's a breach of trust that is severe for the child			0
saying it 's a joke is an immature excuse			0
' this is not the first incident of its kind			0
in march this year , an art teacher at a @entity158 school was suspended following claims she lined up pupils , put sticky tape over their mouths and demanded they keep it on for the duration of the lesson .			1

supply teacher allegedly placed the sticky tape on the child 's face ' as a joke '
@entity14 in @entity8 has since apologised to pupil 's parents
@entity175 says the matter has been investigated and the teacher has resigned
but worried parents have slammed the incident as ' completely unacceptable '
children 's charity @entity111 say the incident could constitute as child abuse
