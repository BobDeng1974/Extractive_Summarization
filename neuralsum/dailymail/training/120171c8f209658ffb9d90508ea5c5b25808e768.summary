by @entity0 one in five women admit to being more turned on by a pair of shoes than by their boyfriends , finds a new study , and one in six say the same of their husbands			1
additionally , half of those surveyed by @entity11 fessed up to lying about the true price of a new pair of heels			1
most women are n't too proud to own knock - offs however , with 82per cent admitting to possessing fake designer shoes			0
shh : one in five women admit to being more turned on by a pair of new shoes than by their significant other , finds a new study , and half are willing to lie about the price they really paid for them the study , which focused on 1,000 women between the ages of 35 and 44 , also revealed that the subject of shoes is a hotbed for female cattiness			1
nearly half admit to having judged someone based entirely on their shoes ; and it 's an even split on whether or not those judgements were positive or negative - depending , presumably , on the caliber of said shoes			2
quite what it is about fancy footwear that has such an enduring appeal among women remains something of a mystery , but its prevalence is undeniable			0
revealed : the study also indicated that women can be catty about shoes , with half admitting they have judged someone else on their footwear alone new shoes you say ? as @entity57 infamously once said in @entity58 , ' men i may not know , but shoes , shoes i know ' in the immortal words of @entity58 front - girl , @entity57 : ' men i may not know , but shoes , shoes i know			2
' @entity67 echoed the sentiment when she proclaimed : ' give a girl the right shoes , and she can conquer the world			0
' and shoe designer to the stars @entity74 famously delivered the verdict : ' a woman can carry a bag , but it is the shoe that carries the woman			0
' in an ironic twist on the fashion staple that entices more lust in some women than their spouses , high - heeled shoes were actually first invented in the 1500s , for men on horseback to stay in their stirrups			2
' a woman can carry a bag , but it is the shoe that carries the woman ' that trend evidently failed to endure for the men , but these days , the average @entity93 woman owns 17 pairs of shoes , and admits to only wearing three pairs regularly			0
and in a final testament to women 's utter devotion to their shoes , the recent study reveals that a quarter refuse to kick their high heels off in the interest of comfort , no matter how painful they might be .			1

@entity11 's new study also found that half of women lie to their spouses about the true cost of their shoes
a quarter refuse to take off their high heels , no matter how painful
