fifty years after the bound body of a dairy farmer was pulled from a river , a new theory has emerged in the unsolved case of his death			1
prosperous but unpopular dairy farmer @entity7 disappeared in the wee hours of @entity8 1957 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
searchers pulled his bound body from the river nearly three months later			1
the case remains officially unsolved , but it 's been widely accepted for decades that a small mob of drunken townspeople incensed by rumors that @entity7 had beaten his elderly hired man kidnapped him , tied him up and threw him in a car trunk , where he suffocated			1
they threw his body into the river			1
he had been bound at the ankles , and with his hands behind his knees			0
a new book claims that he staged an elaborate sucide the crime was deemed a ' lynching ' by editorial writers from @entity34 to @entity35 to the civil rights - era @entity36			2
( all the players in @entity10 were white , but white supremacists in the @entity36 used the story to cry they were being unfairly singled out for the mob killings of black men			2
) the story spread across the globe , even earning a feature in @entity45			0
@entity7 was a successful dairy farmer who had many enemies in the community of @entity9 ' you can go anywhere , quite a ways off , and if you say you 're from @entity9 they 'll bring it up , ' said @entity52 , 72 , who was related to @entity7 by marriage			1
two men later went on trial but were both acquitted			0
so what really happened ? judge @entity57 , who as a new lawyer in 1960 helped represent one of the accused , recently published a book in which he argues @entity7 killed himself , with some ingenuity and difficulty , in a largely successful attempt to get revenge on his neighbors by pinning the blame on them			1
in @entity69 's revenge : the anatomy of a @entity71 , @entity57 argues that @entity7 , broken by the criminal charge he was facing in the hired man 's beating and by the enmity he had created among his neighbors , staged evidence at his farm , walked over a bridge to @entity79 , climbed out on a pier , tied himself up and rolled himself into the water			1
' he was very proud , quick to hold a grudge , and his whole life was crashing down upon him , ' @entity57 said in an interview			0
@entity57 has taken his conclusions to the @entity10 attorney general 's office , whose investigators plan to take another look			2
they could reclassify the case and remove it from the list of @entity10 's unsolved homicides			1
not everybody buys @entity57 's theory			2
' i do n't know why a supposedly intelligent man like judge @entity57 would say that , ' said @entity99 , 75 , @entity7 's niece , who still believes some of her neighbors know what happened to her uncle			1
@entity99 and the @entity103 offer - point - by - point rebuttals of why they believe @entity57 's book is inaccurate , getting basic facts wrong and ignoring others that do n't fit his thesis			2
they speak of threats they believe were intended to keep people quiet , including one in which a note was stuck with a knife to a tree outside the home of a potential witness			0
@entity57 's theory is n't entirely new , but the book lays it out in detail			2
the idea that @entity7 could have tied himself up was brought up during the second trial , but investigators did n't accept it			1
@entity7 , 47 when he died , came to @entity9 with his family as a child			2
he purchased the farm out of foreclosure several years before his death			0
over the years , he built it up to be one of the richest properties in the fertile land along the river			2
but he never fit in			0
he and his wife were n't part of the partying crowd			0
he drew resentment for being the early bird at the courthouse to purchase his property , beating more established townspeople who wanted it			0
@entity7 's barn following his disappearance in 1957			1
evidence of a crime , including depressions in a grain bag where it appeared two men had sat , drag marks on the floor and a crushed milk pail , was found widow @entity156 crying as she sees photo of husband @entity69 in the newspaper			0
his body , which had been bound at the feet and with his hands behind his knees , was pulled from the river three months after his disappearance on @entity8 1957 judge @entity57 demonstrates how it would be possible for someone to tie themselves up and roll themselves into the water and then came the last straw â€” the story about the beating of his hired man			1
@entity7 was charged with a crime , though some argue the man 's injuries were exaggerated by the town rumor mill. the day @entity7 disappeared , he had planned to visit a lawyer			1
@entity52 's husband , @entity182 , now 71 , responded the day of the disappearance to a call from @entity7 's wife when her husband did n't return from the morning milking			1
in the barn , he saw evidence of a crime , including depressions in a grain bag where he believed two men had sat , drag marks on the floor and a crushed milk pail			0
' it was pretty plain that something happened there ; there was not a question in your mind , ' @entity52 said recently			0
police dragged the river but found nothing until the end of march , when troopers discovered @entity7 's body miles downstream			1
he was wearing his farm clothes , his ankles were bound and his hands were tied behind his knees			2
his body was in remarkable condition			2
the death certificate cites ' suffocation ( means unknown ) '			0
it was n't until fall 1958 that a doctor told investigators he had driven by @entity7 's barn the morning the farmer disappeared and saw a car he recognized and two men he knew			1
those two men - @entity224 ' @entity223 and @entity225 - went on trial separately			2
@entity223 was acquitted after the judge ruled there was n't enough evidence to convict him			0
a jury cleared @entity225 , represented with help from @entity57			0
@entity57 , who became a judge in 1970 and retired in 1998 , argues investigators never allowed themselves to consider possibilities other than a vigilante killing			0
he is seeking the support of the @entity237 , a private organization of sleuths that specializes in solving old crimes			0
video from @entity241 the barn where @entity7 disappeared on the morning of @entity8 1957 sits alongside on @entity243 in @entity9 , @entity10 ( pictured last month )			1
almost 60 years after he disappeared and was later found dead , a retired @entity10 judge is arguing in a new book that @entity7 's death was a suicide			1
for decades many thought @entity7 's death was vigilante revenge for his beating of a hired man society member @entity252 said he believes @entity57 's explanation			1
if vigilantes had killed @entity7 , his body would have been beaten to a pulp			1
and by killing himself , @entity7 was able to take control of a life that was spiraling down , he said			2
' if you look at @entity69 's behavior pre-crime , you 'll find that a lot of people had tried to take control of his life , ' @entity252 said			0
by now , most of the original players are dead			0
@entity7 's wife died in 1973			1
@entity223 died two months after the trial			0
despite the ugly memories it dredges up , @entity7 's niece said she thinks it 's good people are talking about her uncle again			1
' we would just like to know the answers , ' @entity99 said			0
' i do n't think there 's any purpose of trying to arrest anyone			0
it 's way past time for that			0
' a bridge crosses the @entity285 from @entity9 , @entity10 , into @entity286 , @entity79			0
@entity7 , a prosperous but unpopular dairy farmer , disappeared in the wee hours of @entity8 1957			1
