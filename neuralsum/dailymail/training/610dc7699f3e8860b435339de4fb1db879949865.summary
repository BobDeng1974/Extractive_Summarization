by @entity0 published : 14:27 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 15:24 est , 29 november 2012 wrong : the behaviour of the press during the search for @entity4 and their treatment of her parents was ' outrageous ' having spent 16 months taking ' the most concentrated look at the press this country has ever seen ' , @entity9 has attacked the ' reckless ' abuses of @entity15 newspapers			1
people who found themselves in the public eye for reasons ' beyond their control ' were treated as ' commodities ' , left with no rights to privacy , dignity or basic respect , he said			1
the parents of @entity26 and @entity4 were used as examples of people who had been abused most			0
the @entity28 received the fiercest criticism as the now - defunct tabloid had a general ' loss of direction ' and ' lack of respect '			1
' at the @entity28 , quite apart from phone hacking , there was a failure of systems of management and compliance , ' he wrote			2
' none of the witnesses were able to identify who was responsible for ensuring compliance with an ethical approach to journalism and there was a general lack of respect for individual privacy and dignity			2
' it was said that the @entity28 had " lost its way " in relation to phone hacking ; its casual attitude to privacy and the lip service it paid to consent demonstrated a far more general loss of direction			1
' the judge also declared the @entity64 had ' failed ' at keeping newspapers in line and protecting the public			1
' there have been too many times when , chasing the story , parts of the press have acted as if its own code , which it wrote , simply did not exist			0
this has caused real hardship and , on occasion , wreaked havoc with the lives of innocent people whose rights and liberties have been disdained , ' he said			2
' this is not just the famous , but ordinary members of the public , caught up in events ( many of them truly tragic ) far larger than they could cope with but made much , much worse by press behaviour that , at times , can only be described as outrageous			0
slammed : the @entity28 ' lost its way ' , @entity9 said , which led to its demise after 168 years ( editor @entity94 holds the final edition ) ' almost everyone accepts that the @entity64 has failed in the task , if indeed it ever saw itself as having such a task , of keeping the press to its responsibilities to the public generally , and to the individuals unfairly damaged			1
there must be change '			0
@entity105 and @entity106 gave moving evidence to the inquiry about their treatment at the hands of the press following the disappearance of their daughter			0
disclosures that @entity118 ’s phone was hacked by journalists and voicemails deleted - giving her parents ' false hope ' that she was still alive - was the scandal that prompted prime minister @entity124 to launch the @entity125			0
' mr and mrs @entity106 were subjected to intrusive and insensitive press reporting at a time of intense personal distress , ' today ’s report said			0
unfair : @entity131 and @entity132 were denied dignity in their treatment by @entity15 newspapers but the report found that mrs @entity106 ’s ' false hope moment ' was unlikely to have been caused by journalists deleting or tampering with messages , but instead by the automatic deletion of messages			2
' the fact remains that the @entity145 hacked the phone of a dead schoolgirl called @entity4 , ' he added			0
the @entity150 ' rights to privacy , dignity or respect were ' trumped ' by the interest in them , the report says			1
' they were also treated as if they were a commodity in which the public , and by extension the press , had an interest or stake that effectively trumped their individual rights to privacy , dignity or basic respect			1
the report added : ' if ever there were an example of a story which ran totally out of control , this is one '			0
statutory press regulation would not have ' prevented the horrors of the past ' , @entity173 said tonight as he reacted to @entity9 's recommendations			2
delivering a lecture at the @entity178 , the chairman of the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) thanked @entity9 for taking time ' to diagnose what has been seriously wrong in the world of newspapers and magazines '			1
acknowledging the ' unacceptable and outrageous behaviour ' of a small minority of journalists , he said the report into press standards was ' impressive ' .			0

lord @entity9 : ' families like the @entity150 and @entity191 found themselves commodities with no rights to privacy , dignity or basic respect '
@entity28 had ' lack of respect ' and ' loss of direction ' , report said
@entity64 ' failed ' to regulate newspapers and protect the public
