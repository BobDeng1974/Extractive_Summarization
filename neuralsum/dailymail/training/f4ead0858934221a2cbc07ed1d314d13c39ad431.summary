by @entity0 @entity1 is no one ’s idea of a soft touch			1
weighing 17st and with the physical attributes of a world - class athlete , the @entity8 - born son of a chemical processor is a tough man earning a hard living in a sometimes brutal sport			2
but @entity1 , just like every professional sportsman , is also a human being			2
last season , at the end of a breakthrough @entity21 which saw the 26 - year - old centre lay down a significant marker for next year ’s @entity24 , the physical and emotional demands of an eight - week campaign away from his family caught up with him			1
roar : @entity1 was driven to tears and broke down after physical and emotional demands last year charge : the eight - week campaign away from his family caught up with @entity1 towards the bitter end bags of potential : the 26 - year - old @entity34 centre laid down a significant marker for next year ’s @entity24 ‘ i generally keep things close to my chest and do n’t tend to share my feelings with other people , ’ @entity1 told @entity36			1
‘ but the week after the @entity21 was really tough			1
things caught up with me and i had to speak to [ @entity43 director of rugby ] @entity42			2
‘ it was a pretty emotional conversation			0
i was a bit embarrassed because i ’d never done that [ broken down ] before			1
but speaking openly about how i was feeling lifted a huge weight off my shoulders			1
the tournament had taken a lot out of us emotionally			0
’ @entity1 ’s emotional fragility was understandable following an intense tournament which began with bitter - sweet news for the former @entity54 and @entity56 star			1
his joy at being handed a first @entity34 cap , against @entity59 in february , had been tempered by learning his mum , @entity60 , had only just been given the all - clear following a major cancer scare			1
‘ @entity62 had a lump and she and the doctors thought it was breast cancer , ’ he said			1
‘ they had to send off a sample for tests and it was a long time before she got the all clear			1
it was a huge time for my family			1
they were obviously overjoyed when they heard i ’d been picked and there were plenty of tears			1
‘ but i was disappointed how the news came out about mum			2
‘ @entity62 and dad had n’t really kept me in the loop because they did n’t want me to worry			1
it was a huge time for our family			1
’ tough : @entity1 's first @entity34 cap took a backseat after his mum , @entity60 , got the all - clear from a cancer scare as is the lot of professional sportspeople , @entity1 had to suppress his personal worries and focus on winning matches			1
he scored a superb debut try as @entity34 lost a pulsating game to @entity59 before crossing twice more in the tournament as @entity97 ’s men came agonisingly close to winning the @entity21			1
the subsequent meeting with @entity42 saw @entity1 reset his sights and he went on to help his club lift the @entity101 and @entity102 title with victory over @entity105 in the final			2
the next day he proposed to his childhood sweetheart @entity107 — after nearly doing so on the @entity109 pitch — before flying halfway around the world to play in @entity34 ’s last two @entity111 defeats against the @entity112 in @entity113			2
‘ it was a funny tour because it had been a big season for the @entity105 and @entity43 boys , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity105 had also been in the @entity117 final against @entity118 and then played against us in the @entity102 final			0
then we flew to @entity113 and played the first test with a lot of emotional things going on			0
‘ we felt a bit of pressure to deliver , flying out two days after the final to start in the second test			2
that pressure of trying to back up what was a successful @entity21 but with less time spent together made it a tricky period			1
i think everyone involved learned a lot from that tour			0
’ with another huge season , beginning with the @entity102 opener this friday night against @entity137 at @entity138 , and hopefully finishing with a home @entity24 on home soil next october , @entity1 has taken up the saxophone in an attempt to keep an even keel			1
' i did n’t want to learn the guitar because that is what everyone wants to play so i decided to buy a saxophone , ’ he said			2
‘ i listen to the @entity150 and a bit of @entity152 for inspiration			1
i ’d like to play at our wedding			0
i had a chat with @entity158 the other day and he ’s going to play the guitar			0
we just need to find a singer			0
pressure : @entity1 admits he felt he needed to do well for his country and ' deliver ' what was expected gearing up : @entity1 has taken up the saxophone and listens to ' @entity150 and a bit of @entity152 for inspiration ' ‘ i said “ between you and your missus [ saturdays popstar @entity168 ] you can find a singer ”			1
’ injuries notwithstanding , @entity1 — whose footballing abilities surprised many last season — is set to be a key figure in @entity97 ’s squad despite fierce competition from other centres @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and soon - to - arrive rugby - league convert @entity182			1
‘ ideally i ’d like to be in the midfield with @entity177 but you just have to respect whatever pairings the coaches come up with , ’ @entity1 said			1
‘ i saw @entity186 at @entity187 say originally that @entity0 was going to play back row so i ’m happy with that ! ‘ it ’s an incredibly exciting time to be involved with @entity34			1
a home @entity24 is going to be absolutely huge and i ’m desperate to be part of it			0
just look at the @entity194 and @entity195			0
‘ i ’ve said to the coaches that this year is about making small sacrifices for what could be a life changing opportunity at the end of it			0
’ but while @entity1 has the world at his feet today , it could all have been very different had mum @entity60 not emailed @entity205 — in his former role as @entity208 director at @entity54 — to express her displeasure at her teenage son being overlooked in favour of a rival			1
‘ one of my team - mates at @entity8 got invited to @entity215 and i was really unhappy about it , ’ @entity1 said			1
‘ it really got under my skin and i went home and sulked			0
eager : @entity1 says a home @entity24 will be ' absolutely huge ' and the centre is ' desperate to be part of it ' ‘ i told @entity62 this lad had been picked and she fired off an email			1
the secretary replied saying @entity97 was happy for me to come along if i was confident i could cut it			0
’ a dual contract with @entity54 and the @entity230 followed and @entity1 spent a precarious four years living on £ 200 a month in student digs in @entity232 alongside five other aspiring professionals			2
only @entity1 has gone on to make it into the top - flight			2
‘ i had nothing else to fall back on , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’d done my gsces and sports science a-levels but after that it was all rugby			2
i had to make it work			0
it did n’t bare thinking about if i did n’t make it			0
‘ when me and @entity107 talk about it now we always say how fortunate we are that i can do this and that it ’s given us such a comfortable life			0
i ’ve seen the other side when it does n’t work out and i ’ve seen people drop off the edge			0
it ’s keeps me humble and motivated to keep getting better because once you get into a hole as a professional sportsman it ’s hard to claw your way out			0
’ a frustrating spell at @entity56 following @entity215 ’ relegation in 2011 led to @entity1 signing a two - year deal with @entity262 in 2012			2
last season , after touring @entity263 with @entity34 , he extended that deal by three years			0
‘ i ’ve managed to turn my career around , ’ he said			0
‘ i really did think @entity43 was my last shot and i knew i could n’t afford to not make it work			0
thankfully it ’s paid off and i ’m loving my time here			0
‘ @entity97 always said i ’d be a late developer and he was right			0
’ on the up : @entity1 acknowledges he has ' managed to turn ( his ) career around ' and is glad his efforts paid off @entity1 is a part of the @entity274 family			2
