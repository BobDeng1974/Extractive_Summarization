the investigation also disclosed that the captain and crew failed to spot the boat on two separate radar screens			1
and @entity13 marine accident investigators also discovered that the ferry 's fog horn had been turned off because it was thought that the sound of the vessel 's engines would be enough to warn craft in the surrounding area			1
a transcript of the conversation on the bridge of the @entity28 showed that crew had no idea that danger was imminent			0
minutes before the fatal impact with the whelk fishing boat @entity58 , the ferry 's unnamed master said to colleagues : ' yesterday evening i watched @entity3 on the tv			2
i 'm an idiot because after that i slept very badly			0
' the first officer replied : ' catwoman ? ' the master said : ' she was jumping from everywhere like a cat			2
she was wearing sexy outfit			1
' the conversation turned went on to talk about drug testing and how long various substances remained in the body			0

her captain @entity82 , 42 , was killed			0

' poor visibility : the 40 mile stretch of sea between @entity21 , @entity22 , and @entity23 , @entity13 , was shrouded in thick fog the day of the collision it added : ' this behaviour , as well as the visibility contributed to the accident			1
' when @entity28 approached the @entity139 waters , both officers did not detect two vessel echoes ahead on starboard , the first was a ship that would be passing a hundred metres on starboard , the second was @entity144			0
' in its findings the report also explained what happened in the final moments on the fishing boat before the collision			2
out of the fog one of the deck hands ' suddenly heard an engine noise very close ' and alerted his colleague who shouted at the skipper ' full astern , full astern '			0
