mr @entity3 ’s determination to give @entity11 official @entity14 the powerful job of @entity16 has sparked an all - party revolt			1

' less stuffy ' : the determination of commons speaker @entity3 ( left ) to give @entity11 official @entity14 ( right ) the powerful job of @entity16 has sparked an all - party revolt the dispute took an extraordinary turn last night after one of ms @entity22 ’s senior colleagues at the @entity35 effectively branded her unfit to do the job			1
@entity37 , clerk at the @entity35 – the equivalent of the post planned for ms @entity22 – said the ‘ embarrassing ’ appointment was ‘ an affront ’			1

mr @entity3 reportedly sees her as a ‘ less stuffy ’ replacement and part of his drive to ‘ modernise ’ @entity87			2
but critics claim it is a secret power grab because she will be unable to challenge his rulings			0
their claims are reinforced in the email sent last week by ms @entity37 , who works closely with ms @entity22			1

‘ @entity14 comes from the state public service			0
it is not simple to move to serving @entity87 if there is a lack of understanding of @entity87			0
’ ms @entity37 echoes mps who say mr @entity3 would ride roughshod over ms @entity22			1
‘ @entity78 heads [ such as @entity14 ] have a lack of appreciation and respect for mps and senators and an over-emphasis on the authority of @entity121 [ such as @entity3 ]			1
’ referring to claims that ms @entity22 ’s department used @entity125 to spy on the office of an @entity11 senator , ms @entity37 said : ‘ i was surprised a resignation did not follow			1
’ she backed calls for mps to quiz ms @entity14 before she becomes @entity16 and chief executive			0
it would be ‘ enormously embarrassing , ’ said ms @entity37			2
she added : ‘ the only thing more embarrassing would be to make the proposed appointment			0
’ sir @entity49 refused to comment on claims that he had kept a diary of the volatile speaker ’s tantrums and alleged four - letter outbursts			0
a well - placed source said : ‘ @entity49 could see the writing on the wall and took the necessary precautions			0
’ @entity145 mp @entity144 said : ‘ it would be wrong for the @entity55 to approve this appointment before mps have been fully consulted			0
’ but last night , the speaker refused to back down , insisting via a spokeswoman that ms @entity22 ’s appointment was ‘ open and fair ’			0
