by @entity0 published : 09:04 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 11:17 est , 31 july 2012 the @entity2 dreams of @entity4 judoka @entity3 ended in tears and heartbreak today as she was controversially disqualified from her first round bout			1
there were boos from the partisan home crowd at the @entity11 when @entity3 , 22 , picked up a passivity penalty with two minutes remaining of her clash with reigning world and @entity16 champion @entity15 of @entity17			1
but things got worse when , with only 30 seconds to go , the fighters fell to the ground and video referees ruled that @entity3 had illegally grabbed her opponent 's leg - meaning an automatic disqualification			1
@entity24 in hands : @entity3 reacts with despair after her disqualification marching orders : an official breaks the bad news to @entity3 after video referees reviewed a tussle on the ground			1
they adjudged that @entity3 had grabbed the leg of her @entity17 opponent @entity15 direct attacks to the legs have been outlawed under new rule changes introduced since the last @entity2			1
@entity3 , one of @entity40 's @entity39 whose progress this paper has tracked since 2005 , had taken the fight to her opponent during the early stages at the start of her under - 63kg category bout , roared on by the home crowd			1
but the judoka from @entity50 could have no complaints about the ruling			2
she said : ' i think it was the right decision			2
i was down a penalty towards the end of the fight and knew she was ahead on attacks , so i had nothing to lose			2
' i felt it was a situation which a few years ago would have been fine , but it is not allowed any more			0
i went for it and i should n't have			0
' @entity3 and @entity15 grapple on the floor with 30 seconds remaining in their first round bout at the @entity11 @entity3 clearly has a hold of her opponent 's foot as they try to score the winning points too late , @entity3 realises that she 's committed a foul and is likely to be disqualified @entity3 , who trains at the @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73 , battled through injury in order to reach the @entity76 and her bout with @entity15 represented a big step up in class			1
nine months ago , she suffered anterior cruciate ligament knee injury which put her @entity2 participation in severe doubt			0
she only resumed full training in march after surgery and months of rehabilitation , making the @entity4 team in june			1
she added : ' maybe when i go home and look at it again i can be positive , but right now i am completely gutted			0
' i did n't come here to fight hard , i came here to win it , so i did n't do what i wanted to			0
' it 's what makes being an @entity2 champion in judo so special - that you do only get that one chance every four years			1
' @entity99 will be the next big thing for me now , but i will just have to wait for that			0
' an official has the task of delivering the bad news to the home favourite after a referral to a video official despite facing the second seed , @entity3 had taken the fight to her opponent in the early stages , encouraged by a large and partisan crowd elsewhere , @entity113 offered no excuses after seeing his hopes of judo gold shattered with defeat to @entity119 @entity118 in the men 's under - 81kg			1
@entity113 , 33 , had once been ranked as high as fourth in his weight division , but last year struggled to make an impact at either the @entity16 or @entity123			1
@entity118 was not the expected opposition for the @entity125 , after knocking out @entity126 of @entity127 , the reigning @entity16 champion who won @entity2 gold at under - 73kg in @entity129			1
however , the @entity119 again produced the goods , this time with an ippon throw to end @entity113 's @entity2 dream before it had the chance to get going			1
' i lost in the biggest tournament in the world , the biggest @entity135 is ever going to see in my lifetime , i do n't really know what else to say , but that is judo , people can get caught , ' said @entity113 , who was choking back the tears afterwards			1
@entity3 bows out of the @entity144 , but said she was already thinking about the next games in @entity99 @entity135 's @entity113 ( in blue ) was defeated by @entity119 's @entity147 in the men 's 81kg category today ' i have caught people quickly in the past , and people have caught me quickly before			1
the fight was pretty even up to that point , but i felt i was going to be able to dominate the fight			0
i did not feel any particular threat until then , but it was a beautiful bit of judo			0
' @entity113 felt he was in top condition to deliver			1
' i felt fantastic , my preparation probably could not have gone any better , that is the most disappointing thing , ' he said			0
' if i had poor preparation , things had not gone well , then you can use all of the excuses , but there are no excuses			0
' i came in feeling one million percent that i could win the tournament and that i was in the best shape of my life			0
' if you are in the best shape of your life and you go out in the first round , then maybe that is telling you something			2
' @entity147 ( right ) , who had defeated the reigning @entity16 champion in the first round , won the bout by @entity176 elsewhere on the fourth day of the @entity2 in @entity177 , @entity135 picked up their fourth medal with silver in the equestrian three - day eventing			1
the @entity4 quintet , which includes the @entity183 's granddaughter @entity182 , finished second behind @entity184			1
@entity185 entered the final showjumping round knowing a run consisting of less than seven points would earn @entity190 silver and she responded with just one time penalty to the delight of the home crowd			2
their brave gold medal challenge ultimately came up short as @entity16 champions and @entity2 title favourites @entity184 took gold , with @entity200 clinching bronze			2
@entity201 crashed out of the canoe slalom after finishing below the cut - off qualification time for the final			0
the 29 - year - old from @entity206 is the world number one but his effort of 106.16 seconds , including a two second penalty , was n't good enough			2
he has another chance of a medal when he competes in the semi-final of the @entity213 - the two - man boat - on thursday with team - mate @entity215			0
@entity216 said : ' i am very disappointed obviously that it did n't go well enough			0
i have wanted to perform at this event for the last four years and not to do so is very frustrating			0
' but it 's part of the sport of canoe slalom - some days it does n't go your way			2
as far as i am aware , i did n't go fast enough anywhere on the whole course			0
there was n't one mistake that cost me time , it was the whole way			0
' all i was trying to do was put in a great run the whole way and that is all i was really concentrating on			0
it 's easy to say it was the pressure of the home crowd ( that got to me ) but this is a very up and down sport and today i was n't good enough			2
' highlights later in the day include the women 's team gymnastics final and the women 's football match at @entity242 between @entity190 and @entity243			2
@entity216 , the world number one , found it tough going in the c - 1 canoe slalom heats and failed to qualify for the final			0

@entity4 hope pulled up for grabbing her opponent 's leg with 30 seconds of first round bout remaining
@entity3 , 22 , had held her own against @entity255 and @entity16 champion @entity15 of @entity17
rules had been changed since the last *olympics*
disappointment too for @entity113 in the men 's 81kg *competition*
