by @entity0 nothing sums up the gap between @entity3 and their first @entity6 opponents @entity4 quite like the sight of manager @entity8 conducting his opening press conference in the lounge of an old bungalow overlooking the club ’ s picturesque @entity14 training ground			1
it used to be the home of @entity3 ’s former groundsman and 1960s striker @entity17 which might explain the anaglypta wallpaper			1
' i grew up with this , ’ says @entity8 admiringly			1
' i remember stripping it off my bedroom wall			2
no health and safety or nothing			2
’ the 43 - year - old probably would n’t think twice about doing the same now			2
after all , he celebrated @entity3 ’s promotion from the @entity29 in april by putting together a bed for his son @entity31 on a high : @entity8 guided @entity3 to the @entity6 last season ready for battle : @entity8 and @entity3 will face @entity4 in their first game back in the @entity6 as this old @entity37 town prepares to welcome @entity6 football for the second time when @entity4 visit @entity40 on monday , @entity8 remains typically unaffected by the hype			1
‘ i put together a bed for my son and it brings normality to me , ’ he said			1
‘ i cut the lawn for a reason – the kids have to learn that ’s what dads do			2
‘ it keeps me a bloke because i am just a bloke			0
i do n’t get too worried about “ oh look at you , @entity6 ! ” it ’s not really my bag that			0
‘ the @entity6 manager tag does n’t make me feel any different			0
i still go home and take the kids into the garden for a game of football , and i let my daughter do my head in asking for a new dress , every day			0
she ’s nine going on 16			0
my life is the same outside of this			0
’ comparisons : @entity8 has the nickname ' the ginger @entity71 ' and will face the real deal on monday keeping things largely the same is the key to @entity8 keeping @entity3 in the top - flight			1
there have been six new signings so far and changes are inevitable ( the home dressing - room has been upgraded , for instance , though not the away one )			0
but he has to draw on the togetherness and team sprit that took @entity3 up against the odds if they are to defy the bookmakers again by not going straight back down , as happened in 2010			1
the fixture list has not been particularly kind			0
the season starts with @entity4 and a match - up between @entity71 and the man they call the @entity71			1
@entity3 ’s second game at @entity40 is against @entity91 , the team they beat in their home opener five years ago			1
chance to shine : @entity93 celebrates scoring for @entity3 in pre-season ‘ there will be a vast gap in resources available , that ’s the reality of it , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ there are probably still eight @entity29 clubs i could name off the bat who have got a better player wage level than we have now			0
‘ but look at what you ’ve got not what you have n’t			0
we have to find a way of operating to get where we want			0
behind my extremely bouncer - like look , there are a couple of brain cells in there			0
was it @entity117 who got three points off @entity120 early last season ? i do n’t think many would have been expecting that			1
‘ there are no guarantees in any division in any season , let alone the @entity6 , so we have to earn the right and fight hard to get what we can off anyone			2

@entity8 and @entity3 kick off new season against @entity4
@entity3 boss celebrated promotion by putting together a bed for son @entity136
