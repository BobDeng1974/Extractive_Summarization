by @entity0 a 36 - year - old man has a rare condition that means his jaw will not stop growing			1
just like @entity5 , who played the @entity7 villain @entity8 , @entity4 has acromegaly which occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone			1
in mr @entity4 's case , the condition is caused by a two - and - a - half centimetre tumour on his pituitary gland			1
@entity4 has a tumour on his pituitary gland which means too much growth hormone is produced			1
as a result , his jaw keeps growing			0
he is pictured ( left ) in 1999 before the problem developed and ( right ) in 2011 now he is facing painful surgery to have his jaw broken and realigned because it has grown by 2cm			1
mr @entity4 said : ' i started noticing facial changes about ten years ago , my jaw was growing outwards and my teeth were becoming misaligned			1
' i thought i was going mad - nobody else seemed to notice that my face was slowly changing shape			0
' if you look back at photos of me in a timeline you can see the slow facial changes to a horrendous asymmetrical cross bite			0
' my jaw just kept changing over time			0
' mr @entity4 , from @entity33 , started noticing changes to his face shape at 25 - years - old when he realised his teeth no longer lined up			1
mr @entity4 ( pictured in 2006 ) had to have surgery to remove the tumour but it failed to solve the problem mr @entity4 has the same condition as @entity5 ( pictured ) who played the @entity44 villain @entity8 in the film @entity46 he also developed strange sensations in his head and low moods before finally being diagnosed in 2012			1
oral drugs and injections failed to control the tumour and eventually it had to be removed during surgery through his nose			1
acromegaly develops when the body produces too much growth hormone			1
this leads to excess growth of body tissues over time			0
it can cause abnormally large hands and feet , large facial features , an enlarged tongue and abnormally great height			0
it is caused by a tumour on the pituitary gland			1
most patients can be successfully treated - brain surgery will often return hormone levels to normal			2
when the tumour is too large to be removed , medication can often help normalise hormone levels			2
source : @entity77 mr @entity4 , a student at @entity78 studying wildlife conservation and zoo biology , said : ' i was diagnosed in 2012 after i got terrible headaches , broke out in sweats and had other strange symptoms			2
' it is fair to say that i have always been conscious about my strong jawline - but there have been noticeable changes in my jaw over the last ten years			0
' i could n’t believe i ’d had the condition for so long without knowing - i should have spent more time looking in the mirror and found a new dentist			0
' mr @entity4 has bee warned by doctors that the condition can result in severe disfigurement , serious complicating conditions , and premature death if left unchecked			2
mr @entity4 's surgery was thought to be successful but in january last year his symptoms returned			2
he said : ' i ’m now on monthly chemical therapy which controls the residual tumour and the hormones it emits			0
' i sometimes do feel tired with a loss of energy , but compared to where i was before my operation and treatment it ’s massively improved			0
' i am out running every weekend but without the amazing care of the @entity77 healthcare professionals at @entity111 , @entity112 and my gp dr j @entity113 , i would not be where i am today			0
' mr @entity4 ( pictured , left , in 2003 and , right , in 2005 ) was only diagnosed with the tumour when he developed severe headaches and a low mood			2
he also experienced strange sensations in his head mr @entity4 ( pictured in 2011 ) is now facing painful surgery to have his jaw broken and realigned because his teeth are out of alignment as a result of the bone growth a spokesperson from @entity127 said : ' acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that results from too much @entity130 ( gh ) in the body			1
' @entity128 is caused by a benign tumour of the pituitary gland , which is called an adenoma and this causes the pituitary to produce too much gh			1
' the nasal bone enlarges and teeth may be spaced out			0
an overgrowth of bone and cartilage can lead to arthritis and when tissue thickens it may trap nerves , causing carpal tunnel syndrome which results in weakness , numbness or pain in the hands			0
' organs in the body , such as the heart can also enlarge			0

@entity4 had a two - and - a - half centimetre tumour on his pituitary gland
this causes too much growth hormone to be produced in his brain
so , his jaw has *lengthened* by 2cm causing his teeth to become misaligned
he had surgery to remove the tumour but this failed to solve the problem
he now takes medication to keep the condition under control
