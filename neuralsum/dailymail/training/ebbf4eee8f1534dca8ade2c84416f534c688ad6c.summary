animal - rights campaigners have criticised @entity1 for allowing users to sell unwanted pets and exotic animals online			1
some people even use the photo - sharing website to sell animals for slaughter as sacrifices at religious rituals			1
thousands of household pets such as puppies , kittens and rabbits are sold through @entity1 posts with the hashtag # forsale			2
sale : this is one of thousands of live animals being offered for sale via photo - sharing app @entity1 advertising : some users have effectively turned their accounts into streams of classified ads for animals users can also browse through a selection of exotic animals requiring specialist care such as snakes , horses and turtles			1
the adverts come in the form of photographs of the animals on sale , with details written in the captions , and can be read online through a computer or via @entity1 's smartphone and tablet apps			2
searching for # forsale brings up more than 1million offerings - most are innocuous items such as clothes , shoes and jewellery , but many are live animals			2
@entity1 users in the @entity54 run accounts selling animals such as sheep which are intended to be slaughtered			1
an account based in @entity59 boasts : ' we have them all , sacrificial and carcasses of all ages			0
we will bring them to you for all events and birthdays			0
' exploitation : campaigners have urged @entity1 to crack down on postings like this one @entity71 : these sheep are being offered for sacrifice by an @entity1 user based in @entity59 animal aid is now calling on the social media site , which is owned by @entity77 , to ban this ' careless slave trading ' of animals			1
' this is a shocking situation to see animals being bred for money and traded like commodities , ' the charity 's director @entity80 said			2
' and this will only lead to suffering and more abuse towards animals			0
' animals are being manufactured and traded as products and this will encourage people to breed carelessly			0
' the easier you make it to buy and sell animals online , the more casual and callous an approach people will take			1
we live in an age where people see animals as disposable and it 's not right			0
unrestricted : @entity1 does not currently have rules against the sale of animals on the site or app ' i urge everyone of conscience to join us and i urge @entity1 not to play host to this careless , selfish and thoughtless trading of animals			1
' this is a dismal development and @entity1 need to recognise it as a very negative thing			0
' the site 's terms of use do not currently contain any guidelines on the advertisement of items for sale , and do not mention the sale of animals			1
by contrast , the leading online sales sites @entity126 and @entity128 both strictly prohibit the listing and sale of live animals			0
@entity1 has declined to comment on the controversy .			0
