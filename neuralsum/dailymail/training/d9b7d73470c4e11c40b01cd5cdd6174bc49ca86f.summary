@entity0 announced this morning it had successfully test launched its new nuclear - capable missile which could hit @entity3 and @entity4 - and beyond			1
the country 's government hopes the $ 500million @entity8 missile , which was launched at 8.07am @entity0 time , will turn the nation into @entity12 's main superpower			1
the @entity8 missile has a range of 5,000km ( 3,100 miles ) , and is seen as key to helping @entity0 in its border disputes with @entity4			1
defence minister @entity31 said : ' the nation stands tall today			0
' @entity33 , head of @entity0 's @entity34 , said : ' @entity0 has emerged from this launch as a major missile power			1
' @entity22 bosses said the weapon rose to an altitude of more than 600km ( 370 miles ) , that its three stages worked properly , and that the missile deployed its payload as planned			1
the test missile was launched from @entity44 off @entity0 's east coast			1
it rose on a pillar of flame , trailing billows of smoke behind , before arcing through the sky			0
@entity4 is far ahead of @entity0 in the missile race , with intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching anywhere in the country			2
' while @entity4 does n't really consider @entity0 any kind of a threat or any kind of a rival , @entity0 definitely does n't think in the same way , ' said @entity61 , a defence analyst in @entity62			2
close : a bird flies perilously near to the missile launch area pioneering : here are the first artist 's impression of @entity8 , which was seen and tested this morning @entity67 , the former head of the @entity68 , said : ' at the moment there is a huge assymetry in @entity4 's favour			1
' after it adds the missile to its arsenal , however , ' @entity0 's deterrent profile in the region would be appropriately burnished '			1
@entity0 already has the capability of hitting anywhere inside arch - rival @entity79 , but has engaged in a splurge of defence spending in recent years to counter the perceived @entity4 threat			0
the @entity0 navy took command of a @entity87 nuclear submarine earlier this year , and @entity0 is expected to take delivery of a retrofitted @entity90 - built aircraft carrier soon			0
the new @entity8 , named for the @entity92 word for fire , is part of this military build - up and was designed to hit deep inside @entity4 , @entity61 said			0
currently , the longest - range @entity0 missile , the @entity96 , has a range of only 2,100 miles or 3,500 kilometres and falls short of many major @entity4 cities			2
@entity0 has also been suspicious of @entity3 's efforts to increase its influence in the @entity102 in recent years and sees the weapons race as a way to fight back			2
' it will be a quantum leap in @entity0 's strategic capability , ' said @entity108 , spokesman for @entity0 's defence research team , which built the missile			1
government officials said the missile should not be seen as a threat			0
' we have a declared no - first - use policy , and all our missile systems , they are not country specific			0
there is no threat to anybody , ' @entity108 said			0
' our missile systems are purely for deterrence and to meet our security needs			0
' the launch window for the missile test , which is being conducted on @entity44 off @entity0 's east coast , opens wednesday evening and closes on friday			1
the @entity8 is a solid - fuel , three - stage missile designed to carry a 1.5 - ton nuclear warhead			0
@entity128 it stands 57 feet tall , has a launch weight of 50 tonnes and was built at a reported cost of 25 billion rupees , and will be moved around the vast country by road or rail			0
rival : @entity4 has long been able to fire missiles to every @entity0 city but now they have fought back and could easily strike @entity139 in the heart of @entity3 , pictured ' @entity8 is a game - changer and a technological marvel , ' @entity141 , scientific adviser to the defence minister , told the @entity145 newspaper			2
the missile could also be used to carry multiple warheads or to launch satellites into orbit			0
the planned test comes days after @entity152 's failed long - range rocket launch			2
@entity152 said the rocket was launched to put a satellite into space , but the @entity156 and other countries said it was a cover for testing long - range missile technology			0
@entity0 's launch sparked none of the same global condemnation aimed at @entity163 , an internationally isolated regime that has been banned by the @entity165 from testing missile technology			1
even if @entity0 's test is deemed a success , the missile will need four or five more trials before it can be inducted into @entity0 's arsenal at some point in 2014 or 2015 , @entity61 said .			1

@entity8 can travel 3,100 miles so could also reach into @entity27 and @entity28
the launch window for the test , to be conducted off @entity0 's east coast , ends on friday
@entity22 chiefs say test launch reached 600km and went as planned
