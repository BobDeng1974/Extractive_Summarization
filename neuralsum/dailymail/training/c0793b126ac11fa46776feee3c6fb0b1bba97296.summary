it was only our love for one another that kept us going after everyone else let us down			0
' mr @entity6 was a resident at @entity34 homeless accommodation in @entity9 for more than two years prior to his ordeal			1
but after breaching the terms of his tenancy by offering @entity7 - who herself was sleeping rough - shelter in his one - bedroom apartment , the pair were kicked out , according to mr @entity6			1
@entity6 , 50 , who relies on crutches to walk , said living in the 15ft wide cave left him at his ' lowest ebb ' as he struggled with the cold and wet conditions the couple had just two sleeping bags to keep them warm and would spend their days looking for firewood with no other home available , the only safe haven they could find was a cave off a popular dog - walking route overlooking @entity9 bay			1
' i 've always been from the area so i knew the cave was there , ' said mr @entity6			1
' it was all we had and our only option - the only place we could go if we hoped to survive			0

' but it was so uncomfortable			0
just imagine yourself what it 's like sleeping in a cave every night			2
' as well as the problems i have with my legs , i 've got depression too			0

life in the cave left me at my lowest point			2
' the cave 's walls were covered in insects and cobwebs with rainwater - which would blow in during the night - seeping in through cracks in its stone ceiling			2
@entity6 said : ' we 'd wake up every morning with the bells going at the church and go down to use their toilet			1
sometimes my legs would be so bad though that i 'd struggle to walk that far and just have to go in the trees beside the cave			2
mr @entity6 and his partner @entity7 had to use public bathrooms to wash themselves and use the toilet ' we had no showers and had to wash under the taps in the local public halls just to make ourselves clean			1

his legs are degenerating so at times he struggles to move at all			0
