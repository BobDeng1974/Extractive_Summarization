by @entity0 a baby who had a heart attack 48 hours after being born and faced never walking or talking has finally returned home to join his twin brother			1
@entity5 had been out of hospital less than 24 hours when mother @entity7 , 25 , noticed he was grunting unusually and took him back to @entity9 where he went into cardiac arrest			1
while his twin @entity11 was thriving at home in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity5 spent two months in hospital fighting a life - threatening infection and meningitis when doctors gave his parents the grim warning that he might never wake up			1
back home : @entity7 , 25 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , and her baby @entity5 who suffered a heart attack @entity7 rushed @entity5 to hospital where he had a heart attack and his condition deteriorated even further and he began to have constant seizures but @entity11 visited him in his hospital cot for ' twin time ' every day and now he 's returned home and his parents count themselves lucky to finally be changing double the number of nappies			1
when non-identical twins @entity5 and @entity11 were born weighing 6lb 1oz and 5lb 3oz on march 28 @entity7 's biggest worry was how she was going to manage a double buggy			1
it was only when first born twin @entity5 started making grunting noises at just two days old that @entity7 started having other concerns			1
she rushed him to hospital where he had a heart attack and his condition deteriorated even further and he began to have constant seizures			2
he was diagnosed with @entity44 - a normally harmless bacteria found in 25 per cent of humans that , if passed onto babies during labour , can have terrible consequences			0
the newborn spent three and a half weeks in intensive care and parents @entity7 and @entity53 were told he was unlikely to survive and were given the chance to take him off the ventilator keeping him alive			1
baby @entity5 with twin @entity11 in hospital			1
@entity5 spent two months in hospital fighting a life - threatening infection and meningitis three weeks after his heart attack @entity5 had started breathing independently and within two months he was back at home like any other baby @entity5 had a heart attack at just 48 hours old and faced never walking or talking doctors gave his @entity5 's parents the grim warning that he might never wake up doctors warned that even if he did wake up it was possible he would never be able to walk , talk or move			1
but just three weeks later @entity5 had started breathing independently and within two months he was back at home like any other baby			1
his hearing is perfect and now his family are waiting on other tests to confirm that he has n't been affected in any other way			0
back together : non-identical twins @entity5 and @entity11 were born weighing 6lb 1oz and 5lb 3oz on march 28 @entity7 said : ' when they were born i was worried about changing all the nappies and the sleepless nights but now i could n't be happier to be doing it ' @entity5 ( left ) was diagnosed with @entity44 - a normally harmless bacteria found in 25 per cent of humans that , if passed onto babies during labour , can have terrible consequences now @entity7 and her family are fundraising for @entity91 where @entity5 was treated and campaigning for all pregnant women to be offered the test for @entity44			1
if a simple test in the final weeks of pregnancy proves positive for the bacteria , antibiotics during labour can minimise the chances of babies developing the infection			2
in the @entity101 , the test is currently only recommended for mothers deemed at specific risk but 40 per cent of cases develop where there are no known risk factors			0
@entity7 said : ' one of the best things is having us all together as a family and the boys back together ' @entity7 and her family are fundraising for @entity91 where @entity5 was treated alright now : @entity5 is back home where he belongs with his family @entity7 said : ' i 'm just overjoyed that the twins are back together			1
' when they were born i was worried about changing all the nappies and the sleepless nights but now i could n't be happier to be doing it			0
' the simple things mean a lot now ! ' when they asked if we wanted to turn the life support off we knew it was touch and go			0
' but he just needed a bit more time and he was such a fighter he was soon munching on the tube trying to breath for himself			2
' the doctors really did n't know what his chances were			0
it 's more common for babies who have been through what @entity139 has not to make it			0
' so the fact that he 's here with us and his hearing has n't been affected at all in incredible			0
he 's doing more every day			2
' one of the best things is having us all together as a family and the boys back together			0
' you can tell they know they 've been reunited			0
they 're more settled when they 're together			0
although they had ' twin time ' during @entity5 's hospitalisation when @entity11 went to sit in his cot for a bit each day it was n't the same			1
' now they cuddle up and they 've always got one body part touching the other			0
them having that time together in hospital must have helped him through			2
' i 'd definitely tell pregnant women to get the test for @entity44 done			0
' if we 'd have known about it before @entity139 was born it would have prevented everything			0
it 's heart - breaking to know that other parents could be in the same situation as us but not be so lucky when it could have been prevented			2

@entity5 spent two months in hospital fighting infection
doctors warned parents @entity7 and @entity53 that he might never wake up
@entity11 visited him in his hospital cot for ' twin time ' every day
but now he 's returned home and his parents count themselves lucky
