@entity33 , a volunteer member of the @entity35 advocacy group @entity34 , claimed he was left feeling like a ' lesser person ' when his order was turned down			1
it had been ordered for a private function marking @entity40 last may			0
mr @entity33 told the court yesterday that he was left ' shocked ' and in ' disbelief ' when mrs @entity0 rang him and told him she would not be processing the order he had already paid for			1
today mrs @entity0 told the court : ' the problem was with the message on the cake because , as a @entity1 , i do not support gay marriage			1
' district judge @entity49 heard that nine members of the @entity52 family work in the business , which makes and delivers cakes across the @entity55 and @entity28			0
mrs @entity0 and her husband @entity56 , who belong to @entity57 , are the only shareholders with voting rights on how the company is run			1
under cross-examination from @entity62 , mrs @entity0 told the court she had been a born - again @entity1 since the age of seven and ' sought to please @entity65 ' in how she led her life			1
she claimed she only took the order from mr @entity33 in order to avoid a confrontation			1
' i did not want to embarrass him or have a confrontation in the bakery , ' mrs @entity0 told the court			1
public opinion on the landmark civil case has been split in @entity28 and beyond			0

mr @entity118 said that , over the next few days , mrs @entity0 expressed concern about the requested cake design with her daughter - in - law , @entity121 , and the matter was then discussed with her son , @entity123			1

@entity157 said : ' the defendants neither knew nor cared about mr @entity33 's sexual orientation or his religious beliefs , if any , or his political opinions			1

' as far as i can recollect , either on the saturday or sunday we were both of the same opinion that we could not proceed and make the cake			2
' meanwhile , @entity141 , @entity110 general manager , said the decision to decline the order had been made regardless of the legal consequences			0
even though he was unaware of the ' ins and outs ' of equality legislation , mr @entity52 said he could not compromise his deeply held @entity1 beliefs opposing gay marriage			1
he said : ' the reason for the decision was that , as @entity1 , we just did not feel that putting the message on a cake - gay marriage is clearly in contradiction of the @entity229			1
' we felt as @entity1 we could not put that message on a cake			1
' he told the court : ' we knew the decision in our conscience as @entity1 was one that we had to make			1
' that 's why i said to mum regardless , as @entity1 we are bound by what we believe			2
' this is what we are bound to do			0

he said the family had not taken legal advice but he had telephoned a church elder to ' ask his thoughts ' on the matter			0
' we were not doing it in defiance of the law , ' added mr @entity52			0
' i think it is quite obvious that we do not know a lot of the ins and outs of the law			0
' our @entity1 faith is of utmost importance to us			2
it is how we run our lives ; it is how we live our lives ; it is how we bring up our families			0

on the other side of the large dock , normally used to hold criminals facing trial , mr @entity33 sat listening intently , supported by male and female friends			2

@entity9 , which employs around 80 people , has been backed by the @entity302 lobby group , which has arranged public meetings and garnered financial backing for the legal action			0
same - sex marriage remains a contentious issue in @entity28 and attempts to have it legalised have been repeatedly rejected by the devolved @entity309 at @entity310			0
the cake row has prompted a proposal to include a so - called ' conscience clause ' in equality legislation			0
