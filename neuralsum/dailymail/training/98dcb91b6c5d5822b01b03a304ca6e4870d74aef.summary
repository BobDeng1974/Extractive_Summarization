@entity2 ’s @entity1 captain @entity0 admitted on monday he was deeply concerned about @entity4 ’s prospects of being fit for the @entity1 at @entity5 in september			1
‘ it concerns me because it is an injury that he ’s tried to correct , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ this does n’t bode well right now			0
’ even if @entity4 somehow declared himself fit , the worry for @entity0 would be that his back might go again in @entity11 , as it did at @entity12 on sunday when he had to withdraw after nine holes of his final round of the @entity15			1
while he did that , his caddie @entity28 made his way to @entity31 and mapped out the course being used for the @entity33 this week , which certainly earned him full marks for blind optimism			1
woods played the following week after withdrawing with a back spasm at the @entity38 in february but was in such pain by the end he had difficulty standing over a putt			1
a fortnight later , he underwent an operation for a herniated disc that kept him out for four months			0
difficult time : the 14 - time @entity48 winner 's caddie @entity28 is scouting the @entity33 course @entity50 contrast : @entity4 looks a shadow of the player that dominated golf a decade ago @entity56 highlights @entity4 has 14 major championships to his name , but has not added to his tally for six years			1
@entity60 , whose record haul of 18 majors @entity4 is chasing , once went six years without winning one before his remarkable 1986 @entity65 victory , aged 46			2
@entity4 is still on course to match @entity60 , though			2
aged 38 , he has the same number of majors as @entity60 did at that age , with the latter winning his 15th before his 39th birthday			0
we await to see what his next move will be on this occasion but surely under consideration is to take the rest of the year off and try to get fully fit in time for a serious tilt at the majors next season			0
what was really noticeable during the nine full rounds he has played to date was just how badly he struck the ball			0
woods put it down to ‘ needing more tournament reps ’ and the usual stock cliches he fobs reporters off with , but this is the man who used to take the winter off and win his first tournament back in @entity92 almost as a matter of routine			0
even before sunday , the after - effects of the injury were clearly still playing their part in preventing him doing what he needs to do behind the scenes to perform at even a fraction of his best , so what is the point in carrying on until he is healthy ? following on from the @entity33 is the four tournament @entity104 series and @entity4 has next to no chance of qualifying for that anyway			1
only the top 125 make it to the tee for the first event and right now he is outside the top 200			0
doubt : @entity4 's agent has said he might play at the @entity33 at @entity31 this week even if by some act of fool - hardiness he made it to @entity31 he would need something like a top - three finish to make the @entity119 and the chances of that happening are right up there with @entity123 going a month without selling someone			1
next up after that , following a week ’s break , is the @entity1			2
if somehow selected , there has been some talk that @entity4 would be prepared to play in the @entity129 the week before @entity5 to get ready but that appears highly fanciful			1
the great fear right now , of course , is that he has suffered something more than a temporary spasm that might be within the healing powers of a good physio , and has a recurrence of the original injury			0
@entity4 has had four surgeries on his right knee but , as we know , backs are an altogether different matter			2
changing of the guard : @entity145 holds the @entity15 trophy aloft after winning at @entity12 you can not keep going under the knife for a bad back			1
what we can say for certain at this stage is that all those years of pushing his body beyond its natural limits , of training with army seals and the like , have wreaked a terrible vengeance			2
with the best will in the world , with all this physical scarring , can anyone see @entity4 ever again reaching the heights @entity145 has touched in the past month and that he used to reach himself so frequently ? we surely have not seen the last of @entity4 , by any means			0
but the best of him ? sadly , that might be the case .			0

@entity4 had to withdraw from the @entity15 on sunday nine holes into his final round at @entity12
@entity4 is seeing specialists in @entity25 after feeling his back spasm
@entity2 captain @entity0 has expressed his concern for @entity4 , with september 's @entity1 at @entity5 on the *horizon*
@entity178 ' caddie @entity28 has travelled to @entity31 to scout the @entity33 course
the 14 - time @entity48 winner 's body appears to be *paying* the price for gruelling training *regime* of early career
