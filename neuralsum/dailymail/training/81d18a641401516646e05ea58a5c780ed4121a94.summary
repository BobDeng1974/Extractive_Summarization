a dog has become the first pet in @entity2 to be killed by an electronic cigarette			0
@entity4 died within hours of chewing on a bottle of nicotine - laced liquid used to fuel the smoke - free vaporiser			1
her owner @entity9 , 56 , bought the device in a bid to cut down on his tobacco habit			0
the battery - powered aid works by heating up the ' e-liquid ' into a gas which the user inhales like real cigarette smoke			1
@entity4 died after chewing on a bottle of nicotine - laced liquid used in an e-cigarette coach driver mr @entity9 , of @entity21 , @entity22 , had left a bottle of the liquid on his dining room table when 14 - week - old @entity4 bit into it			1
she immediately started frothing at the mouth and vomiting and @entity9 rushed her to the vets , where she was given huge doses of steroids , but died from nicotine poisoning early the next day			1
there are currently warnings on the bottles but grandfather @entity9 wants to see e-liquid become a controlled substance before it kills another animal			0
he said : ' i peered round the corner from the kitchen and the dog was on the floor with the bottle of e-liquid			1
' she had chewed it and pierced the plastic container			0
she had only ingested the tiniest amount but by the time i picked her up she was frothing at the mouth			1
@entity9 with an e-cigarette similar to the one which killed his pet dog @entity9 says @entity56 bull terrier @entity4 died of nicotine poisoning hours after chewing on the e-cigarette nicotine is a highly poisonous substance that can kill both humans and animals			1
in the @entity65 by @entity66 , @entity64 detective @entity63 investigates when one character , sir @entity68 , was poisoned with nicotine , a colorless , odorless liquid lethal at just a few drops			1
toxicology experts warned that drinking the equivalent of just two bottles of e-liquid could deliver enough nicotine to kill a human			1
there were nine @entity2 deaths from nicotine poisoning in the three decades leading up to the 1970s , when nicotine was available in liquid form in insecticides			1
the lowest fatal dose was between 50 and 60 milligrams - equivalent to smoking about 20 to 30 cigarettes or drinking two high strength bottles of e-liquid containing 24 milligrams of nicotine each			1
nicotine poisoning induces vomiting , muscles spasms and seizures			1
in fatal cases it interferes with the central nervous system and causes respiratory failure			0
it is also highly poisonous to cats and dogs			0
common signs to watch for include vomiting , abnormal heart rate , uncoordination , tremors , weakness and collapse			1
nicotine is a rapid acting toxin and , often , pets will show signs of poisoning within 1 hour of ingestion , the @entity104 helpline warns			1
the toxic dose for nicotine in pets is 1/2 - 1 mg per pound of pet body weight , while the lethal dose is 4 mg per pound of pet body weight			1
so a 40lb dog would get very sick after eating one cigarette - but would need 11 cigarettes to die from nicotine poisoning			1
pets ingesting small amounts of nicotine often vomit spontaneously and may self - decontaminate			1
however , even when vomiting occurs , veterinary evaluation after ingestion is typically recommended so that the heart rate , blood pressure and neurological status can be monitored			2
treatments including additional decontamination , iv fluids and medications to slow the heart rate , decrease the blood pressure or stop tremors may be needed			0
' i attempted to cool her down with cold water but i do n't know any dog first aid , i just did whatever came into my mind			0
' her tongue was blue , her lips were blue			0
she messed herself , then she vomited			0
' my partner was on the phone to the vet who said get her here as quickly as possible			0
' when we got there the vet went on to the veterinary websites but could n't find anything about nicotine poisoning			2
' he eventually went away and got an old book on poisons			0
he shook his head and told us it was n't good			0
' he gave her an injection of steroids , then put her on a drip and promised to phone us every couple of hours through the night			2
' they said the first 12 hours were critical and we received a call after 12 and a half hours saying she had passed away			2
her lungs and heart had given up			0
' @entity9 - who uses an @entity171 fuelled by @entity172 - is one of an estimated four million people in @entity2 who have turned to electronic cigarettes			2
the @entity175 has refused to endorse the device until long - term trials prove they are safe			2
the e-liquid itself contains chemicals such as propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol 400 which are mixed with vegetable glycerin and various flavourings , plus varying amounts of nicotine			2
while it would take a large dose of nicotine to harm a human , experts say a dog would only have to ingest 10 milligrams per kilogram of animal weight to be in danger			2
there have been reports of pets fatally chewing on tobacco but @entity4 is believed to be @entity2 's first canine victim of e-liquid			1
@entity9 wants to see much clearer health warnings on bottles and wants them sold as controlled substances like medicines or alcohol			0
@entity4 , who came from an @entity208 rescue centre , was treated at @entity209 in @entity210 , @entity22			1
vets there confirmed that @entity4 's symptoms , which included vomiting , diarrhoea , difficulty in breathing and heart problems , are all typical of nicotine poisoning			1
a spokesperson said : ' the dog started to get a reaction after 30 seconds of piercing the bottle			1
' we managed to keep her going for a few hours , but she died in the early hours of monday morning			1
' the fluid is potentially fatal for dogs and they are perfectly capable of putting a tooth through the packaging			0
' @entity9 's vaporizer was a @entity233 electronic cigarette , produced by a different company , @entity2 - based @entity234			2
neither company has responded to a request for comment			0
nicotine is also a highly toxic to humans			2
professor @entity240 , professor of toxicology at @entity242 , said : " make no mistake nicotine is a potent and highly toxic chemical that kills			2
' when you smoke cigarettes the concentration of nicotine is small and delivered over a period of time so the compound is metabolised and broken down in the body			0
' but when it was used in insecticides there were quite a few cases of humans dying as a result of drinking it , either deliberately or accidentally			0
' certainly these bottles of e-liquid should come with clear warning labels and they should be kept well away from children			0
' @entity264 , public health adviser at the @entity266 , added : ' @entity267 is a toxic substance and poisonous to children			0
' this is why it is important to treat electric cigarettes and its components - including the e-liquid - in the same way as you would household chemicals , by storing them out of the sight and reach of children in a locked cupboard			0
' if you believe that your child has ingested nicotine , seek medical advice immediately			0
