by @entity0 last updated at 11:40 am on 8th september 2011 @entity1 is likely to be freed , according to one of the lawyers opposing her murder appeal			2
a prosecutor in the @entity1 appeal case has said ' an ill wind is blowing ' as she predicted the @entity8 would be acquitted of the murder of @entity10			1
@entity11 , who is one of two prosecutors involved in the appeal of @entity14 against her conviction for the murder of student @entity10 , 21 , said she was convinced the @entity8 would be freed			1
@entity11 made her comments just hours before the appeal hearing resumed today , with prosecutors and defence lawyers again contesting crucial dna evidence			2
hopeful : @entity1 , seen here at her appeal hearing in @entity24 , is another step closer to freedom after a judge 's ruling today @entity14 , 24 , is serving 26 years for the murder of @entity10 , 21 , who was found with her throat slashed and semi naked in the bedroom of the house she shared with her and two other women in november 2007			1
her former boyfriend @entity36 , 27 , was also convicted of murdering and sexually assaulting @entity10 and he is serving 25 years with both claiming they had nothing to do with the killing			1
miss @entity11 said : ' there is an ill wind blowing in this case			0
' the judge and his assistant are clearly against us			2
i can see both @entity14 and @entity36 being freed which will be a shame as they are both involved			1
' @entity14 is led into court in @entity24 by a police officer as her appeal hearing comes towards its conclusion the prosecutor spoke as the judge in the case denied her a further re-examination of forensic evidence			1
an earlier review had cast doubt on dna findings used by the prosecution			0
key to the case is a 30cm kitchen knife found at @entity36 's apartment , on which dna from @entity14 was on the handle and that of @entity10 was discovered on the blade			1
however the independent report by @entity69 and @entity70 of @entity72 's @entity71 has questioned the reliability of the findings by forensic scientists			0
although they do not doubt @entity14 's dna is on the handle they have questioned the findings related to @entity10 , insisting that the level is so low it should not have been admitted as evidence in the first trial			1
the experts have also questioned the reliability of dna evidence found on @entity10 's bloodied bra clasp which was found at the scene and then ' missed ' for six weeks			1
the original trial heard there were traces of @entity36 on the clasp after it was examined by forensic scientists but the experts say the fact it was left for six weeks at the scene leaves it open to contamination			0
@entity100 forensic scientist @entity99 , who led the original investigation , has dismissed any suggestion of contamination and insisted she and her team followed strict guidelines			0
however , earlier in the appeal the court was shown a video which showed the forensic team collecting evidence with dirty gloves and using their hands instead of tweezers to collect items			0
@entity36 , seen left arriving at the appeal hearing in @entity24 yesterday , is disputing his part in the death of student @entity10 , right @entity11 added : ' we are going to ask for a second review of the evidence			1
there are to many aspects that are incomplete and we believe the experts are wrong so we want another review			0
' this could take another sixty days but i 'm not confident that the judge will grant the prosecution request - it 's very obvious this time that they are against us			0
' @entity11 said that the tests , if granted , would be carried out using new techniques which had not previously been available when the first tests were carried out almost four years ago			0
she also said she would request that @entity135 mobster @entity134 who had earlier testified that @entity14 and @entity36 were innocent of the murder be called back			1
denial : @entity14 has appealed her murder conviction at the court in @entity24 after always denying she played a part in @entity10 's killing investigation : forensic teams search the @entity24 flat in november 2007 where @entity10 's body was found @entity147 has told the hearing that it was his on - the - run brother and fellow mobster @entity151 who had carried out the killing after he was disturbed by @entity10 during a botched break in			1
@entity11 said : ' @entity147 was a key witness for the defence in this appeal but he has now contacted me to retract everything he said so it is only right that we ask for him to be called back so he can testify again			0
' the findings of the review had given hope to @entity14 and @entity36 that they would be acquitted at the end of september when the court is expected to give its verdict			1
however a request to have a second review plus @entity147 heard again could delay a verdict by as much as two months , meaning no decision before november at the earliest - four years after @entity10 was murdered			1
after the hearing @entity14 's father @entity171 , said : ' i 'm very happy with the decision to stick with the original independent review - it 's a tell tale of how the court feels the report was effective			1
bereaved : @entity183 , with her mother @entity178 and father @entity180 in @entity24 in 2007 , have pleaded for their daughter to ' not be forgotten ' ' the court truly believes in what the experts have told them			0
we are still hopeful and this tells me that the court believes what these experts are saying			0
' @entity1 is happy and hopeful that she wo n't be spending too much more time in prison but it 's still up to the judges in the court and we will start those arguments later this month			0
' these were court appointed experts and if you ask me it looks like an act of desperation from the prosecution			0
i personally did n't believe that another review was necessary			0
' it seems as if they are unwilling to listen to common sense - there was no trace of @entity1 or @entity36 in the room where @entity10 was murdered			2
' the prosecution should be seeking the truth and i 'm sure that is something the @entity214 would want			0
' @entity10 , from @entity215 , @entity216 , was in @entity24 as part of her @entity218 and had only been in @entity219 for two months before she was brutally murdered			2
a third defendant , small - time drug dealer @entity10 , an immigrant from the @entity222 , was also jailed in connection with the brutal killing			2
he was handed a 30 - year sentence for murder and sexual violence following a fast - track trial in october 2008 which was later cut to 16 years .			2
