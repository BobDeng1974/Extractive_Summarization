it is a battle to send a drone supersonic - and pits @entity2 against @entity3			1
experts have claimed that @entity2 's drone , called @entity6 , is under secret development			1
it was unveiled in 2006 at an airshow , but has since disappeared from public view			1
however , it has now reappeared in a report on the the website of the country 's national broadcaster cctv			0
the @entity6 - known in @entity2 as " @entity12 " - made its debut at the @entity14 in southern @entity2 's @entity15 province			0
the model was subsequently exhibited at the @entity24 - but was then never heard of again			0
some claim the project has already been scrapped due to insufficient funding or other reasons , while others believe the development of the drone is now being kept secret as it is undergoing further research and testing , according to @entity34 @entity2 aviation expert @entity35 told @entity34 that while he does not know the status of the @entity6 project , the drone could become the world 's first supersonic uav if it proves a success			1
he said he would not be surprised if the project is still ongoing in secret as a lack of transparency is nothing new for the aviation industry and is an approach commonly taken by the @entity49			2
the craft has ' less emphasis on stealth in comparison to other 601 - @entity54 , but instead , more emphasis is on maneuverability , ' according to reports			0
however , the developers have stated that the primary focus of @entity6 is to develop it into a hypersonic @entity39 , in order to fulfill the requirement of a low - observable , high maneuverability , hypersonic @entity39 to support tests conducted for @entity2 air defense and air - to - air weaponry the drone will be pitted against @entity69 system 's @entity67 in the supersonic race			1
earlier this year @entity3 ’s next generation military drone has ‘ surpassed all expectations ’ in its first test flight			2
@entity67 , which is named after the @entity75 god of thunder , is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single - wing stealth design			1
@entity69 also announced its @entity80 demonstrator @entity67 has successfully completed a second phase of flight testing			1
during tests , @entity67 ( pictured ) flew in a fully ' stealthy ' configuration , making it virtually invisible to radar @entity67 is the @entity3 's next generation military drone , named after the @entity75 god of thunder			1
it is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single - wing stealth design			1
the autonomous vehicle made its first test flight in august , when it took off , rotated , climbed and landed at various speeds and altitudes			0
@entity69 which made the aircraft , described it as ‘ the most advanced aircraft ever built by @entity3 engineers ’			2
@entity67 cost £ 185million to develop and was funded jointly by the @entity100 and @entity3 industry			2
the drone is around the same size as a @entity105 fighter jet and is the result of one - and - a - half million hours of work by @entity3 engineers from over 250 companies			2
the pilotless combat aircraft made ‘ a perfect take - off , rotation , “ climb out ” and landing on its first flight , ' according to @entity69 , which made the drone			1
the @entity3 defence firm described its largest drone as ‘ the most advanced aircraft ever built by @entity3 engineers ’ and test pilot @entity118 tried it out for a 15 minute flight at ‘ an undisclosed test range ’ in august			2
the advanced weapon , which could spearhead the fight against terror in @entity124 , cost £ 185million to develop and was funded jointly by the @entity3 mod and @entity3 industry			0
it made a number of flights last year at a variety of altitudes and speeds for periods of up to one hour , the company said			0
@entity67 is the result of one - and - a - half million hours of work by @entity3 engineers from over 250 companies , but only a select group have a lot of access to the secret aircraft			1
‘ @entity67 is providing vital insights that will help shape future capabilities for our @entity141 in coming decades			2
' its advanced technology is testament to the @entity3 's world leading engineering skills that keep @entity3 at the cutting edge of defence , ’ @entity143 , minister for defence equipment , support and technology said			0
@entity67 ( graphic pictured ) is named after the @entity75 god of thunder and designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single - wing stealth design			1
during tests , @entity67 also used latest stealth communications systems to stay in touch with its commander without revealing its position military chiefs believe @entity67 ’ ground - breaking technology will allow a powerful new generation of drones equipped with deadly payloads to fly from @entity3 bases and attack targets worldwide			1
but the new developments in pilotless aircraft are controversial as they allow the possibility of autonomous computers targeting and killing enemy combatants outside human control			0
experts have previously warned that the new technology would potentially lead to a nightmarish scenario of out - of - control robots waging war on humans and have even called for a global ban on autonomous technology			0
the new drone has made a number of flights last year at a variety of altitudes and speeds for periods of up to one hour , @entity69 said @entity3 ’s armed drones are currently piloted remotely by aircrews on the ground , but @entity67 will follow a set flightpath using on - board computers to perform manoeuvres , avoid threats and identify targets			1
only when it needs to attack a target will it seek authorisation from a human controller			0
‘ this is a very dangerous move			0
' once it has been developed , who knows what new governments who inherit the technology will do with it , ’ professor @entity202 , a robotics engineer specialising in autonomous military systems at @entity204 , said last january			0
last year @entity212 warned that the fight against terrorism in @entity124 could last decades , meaning futuristic drones could dominate counter-terrorism strategy in the region			0
@entity3 forces operate armed drones in @entity220 , where they target @entity223 insurgents and the @entity224 has committed itself to a new generation of pilotless aircraft which can fly distances of more than 2,000 miles .			0

drone was shown off at airshows until 2006 - then disappeared
claims the project is undergoing secret testing and could be ready for flight
@entity69 is also *hoping* to create supersonic drone with its @entity67
@entity67 - named after the @entity75 god of thunder - is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and to evade enemy radar
