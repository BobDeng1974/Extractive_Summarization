@entity8 claims that pet food at her store is healthier than some food for humans
her vow to eat pet food for 30 days is aimed at *informing* people about healthy eating for humans and their furry friends
@entity38 says she 's lost two pounds after one week of her pet food diet and has more energy at the end of the day
her co-workers think the food is ' a little dry ' but ' not too bad '
her favorite food is canned ' succulent chicken ' and freeze dried blueberry and *vegetable* snacks
