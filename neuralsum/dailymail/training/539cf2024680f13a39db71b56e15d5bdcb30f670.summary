by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:07 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 18:07 est , 11 march 2014 the @entity3 were are considering appealing against an independent disciplinary commission for the second time in a week after @entity6 manager @entity5 escaped with a seven - match ban for butting @entity9 ’s @entity8			1
the punishment , made up of a three - match stadium ban and a four - game touchline suspension , is a record for a @entity15 manager but it is sufficiently lenient to spare @entity5 further censure from @entity6 amid fears that he was in danger of being sacked by owner @entity21			1
but any sense of relief could soon disappear if the @entity3 choose to appeal when they receive the written reasons for a judgement that has left @entity27 officials slightly baffled ; not least the decision to split the suspension between a stadium ban and a touchline one			1
only last week it emerged that the @entity3 wanted to see @entity66 ’s @entity65 suspended for double the five - match ban he received for his ‘ quenelle ’ goal celebration in a game against @entity71 in december			1
the @entity3 are considering an appeal against that judgement as well , with an announcement anticipated thursday			0
clearly , the @entity3 thought @entity5 deserved a harsher punishment for his attack on @entity8 during a game his team were winning comfortably			1
in the wake of @entity83 ’s five - match stadium ban for a physical confrontation with a fourth official in the tunnel earlier this season , a stadium ban as long as 10 matches was thought to be possible			1
revisited : the @entity3 were left frustrated last week when @entity65 only received a five - match ban for his ' quenelle ' gesture clash : @entity83 was handed a five - match ban when he clashed with the fourth offical while manager of @entity94 clash : @entity5 reacted in unprecedented fashion to being barged by the @entity97 international scuffle : the incident started after @entity8 pushed @entity5 out of the way with the ball rolling towards him off you go : @entity5 is sent to the stands by referee @entity104 @entity6 are disappointed with the actions of its manager @entity5 this afternoon ( saturday , 1st march )			1
his behaviour was unacceptable and is not the behaviour we expect from the manager of @entity6			0
it is most disappointing that this incident has taken the focus away from what was a fantastic performance by the team and an excellent result away from home which leaves the club in eighth place in the @entity15			0
sadly , the headlines tomorrow will not be focused on the result or the efforts of the players , but instead on the actions of our manager			0
@entity5 unreservedly apologised immediately following the game to the player , to @entity9 and its fans , and to the fans of @entity6			1
we have held discussions this evening with @entity5 who has offered his sincere apologies to the @entity9 and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions			2
@entity5 has accepted a formal warning from the @entity9 in relation to his behaviour today and also a @entity9 fine of £ 100,000			2
@entity139 is now drawing a line under this matter and will be making no further comment			0
as things stand @entity5 will not return to the @entity6 dug - out until the final three games of the season , at the end of april			1
@entity5 attended the two - hour hearing at @entity27 and an admission of guilt , as well as the mitigation he offered , was clearly well - received by the commission			2
nevertheless he will not be present for @entity6 ’s visit to @entity43 on saturday			0
he will also miss home clashes with @entity45 and @entity47 , handing control to assistant @entity156 before returning to the stands for the visit to @entity48			0
then he misses home games against @entity50 and @entity53 and the trip to @entity52			0
he will return for the @entity54 game at the @entity162 on april 29			0
@entity5 has also been fined £ 60,000 , on top of the £ 100,000 fine he received from @entity6 immediately after the incident			2
@entity5 said : ‘ as i have made clear , i deeply regret the incident and again wholeheartedly apologise to all parties for my conduct , which i understand was not acceptable			0
‘ i will accept the punishment handed down by the @entity3 today			0
my focus now turns to preparing the team for this weekend ’s game against @entity43 and finishing the season as strongly as possible			0
’ after the @entity3 announced its decision , @entity6 issued a statement confirming their manager ’s punishment			2
from above : @entity5 ( centre ) looks on from the stands as @entity6 secured a 4 - 1 win opinionated : @entity179 , who managed @entity6 in 2009 , slammed @entity5 for his headbutt it read : ‘ @entity6 can confirm that manager @entity5 will serve a seven - match suspension with immediate effect after admitting an @entity3 misconduct charge following an incident with a @entity9 player in the 72nd minute of the @entity15 fixture on saturday , 1st march			1
‘ an @entity189 today ( tuesday , 11th march ) ruled the first three - matches imposed are a stadium ban with the remaining four a touchline ban			1
‘ @entity5 was also fined £ 60,000 and warned as to his future conduct			0
@entity139 and @entity5 have accepted the decision and now wish to draw a line under the matter			0
’ bittersweet : @entity197 also laid into @entity5 for his actions as @entity6 ran out 4 - 1 winners hot water : @entity5 called @entity202 boss @entity201 a ' f * * * * * * old c * * * ' in january spitting feathers : @entity5 was banned for two matches after pushing a linesman against @entity208 in 2012 room with a view : the @entity6 boss was banished to the @entity212 stands after the push heated : @entity214 took exception to @entity5 's over-zealous celebrations in the 2011 @entity217 november 2006 : @entity5 had earlier in the year criticised @entity54 boss @entity218 for failing to field an @entity220 player in the @entity222 match against @entity223 and matters came to a head in @entity71 's 1 - 0 win over @entity54			1
then @entity71 boss @entity5 's enthusiastic celebrations appeared to irritate @entity218 , who claimed he was ' provoked in a disrespectful way ' , with the pair having to be kept apart by the fourth official			1
on this occasion , it was the @entity233 boss who was fined by the @entity3 , with @entity5 cleared of all charges			2
march 2012 : in a @entity217 , it perhaps comes as no surprise that the tension boiled over , with @entity5 , now @entity6 boss , clashing with @entity214 following his celebration to @entity241 's late equaliser in a heated match			1
both managers pledged afterwards to keep their emotions in check in future			0
august 2012 : @entity5 came under severe criticism and then afterwards labelled his behaviour ' ridiculous ' when he shoved linesman @entity250 in the @entity252 ' season opener against @entity208 after disagreeing with the official 's decision to award @entity208 a throw - in			1
@entity5 once again apologised for his actions but the @entity3 took a dim view and hit him with a two - match touchline ban and a £ 20,000 fine			1
january 2014 : @entity5 became involved in another touchline row , less than a month after having heated words with @entity48 boss @entity262 , with @entity202 manager @entity201			2
television cameras clearly showed the @entity6 boss launching an expletive - laden volley at the @entity266			2
@entity5 was spared punishment but said later : ' it was a heat of the moment thing , words we always have as managers , to a degree			0
i 've apologised and i 'm fortunate that he 's accepted that			0

the @entity3 are considering an appeal after @entity5 was given a seven - match ban for headbutting @entity9 's @entity8
the governing body are baffled that the decision was split between a stadium and touchline ban
the @entity3 were left frustrated by own disciplinary process just last week when @entity65 only received a five - match ban for his ' quenelle ' gesture
after @entity83 was banned for five matches earlier this season for his clash with a fourth official , a sterner penalty was expected for the @entity6 boss
