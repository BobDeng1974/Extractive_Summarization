reader @entity40 spotted the story and recognised the bear as a family heirloom he lost while travelling through the airport on his way to @entity46			1
he said : ' i was stunned when i got a cutting of the @entity38 in the post and saw my bear on the front page			2
' i thought it was lost forever , i was convinced it had been destroyed			0
' the bear was found in 2012 and staff spent 14 months trawling flight records to see if they could find any two passengers with the same names as those mentioned on the back of the picture			2
when they could not they appealed for help from the public and a number of experts stepped forward to help with the search			0
they were able to trace the date of the picture after they discovered a second message on the picture , which said : ' taken on @entity76 's birthday march 4th 1918 , one year and five - months - old			0
' but , despite tracing who the children were they were unable to find them			0
