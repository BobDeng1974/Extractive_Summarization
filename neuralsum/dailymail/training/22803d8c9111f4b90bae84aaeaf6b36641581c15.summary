@entity0 wants to use new anti-lout powers to ban ' inappropriate dress ' on stag and hen weekends			1
the seaside town – once famous for its ' kiss me quick hats ' – says public nudity during the daytime sends out the wrong message			0
but critics say the move would be the equivalent of criminalising women for showing too much cleavage or wearing a short skirt			1
ministers insist the so - called public spaces protection orders ( @entity45 ) are intended to clamp down on anti-social behaviour , such as spitting and aggressive begging			0
but the rules have been so widely drawn that councils are also planning to apply them to the likes of ' nuisance parking ' , children playing ball games and parents parking outside schools			0
council officers can put up signs banning an activity in a specified area , either round the clock or during specific hours			0
anybody flouting the order will be liable for an on - the - spot fine , normally ranging from £ 70 to £ 100 , issued by a police officer , @entity64 , council worker or private security guard employed by the local @entity67			1
@entity0 has long been regarded as fun town and in what is often thought of as its heyday ( 1900 – 1950 ) , it thrived as the factory workers of northern @entity74 took their annual holidays there ( file photo ) refusing to pay will be a criminal offence that can land the person responsible in court			1
yesterday , @entity81 cabinet member @entity80 said @entity82 could be used to target the dress of stag and hen parties			0
@entity0 councillor @entity80 said @entity82 could be used to target the dress of stag and hen parties			1
this would involve a restriction on ' public nudity ' or inappropriate dress in the daytime this would involve a restriction on ' public nudity ' or inappropriate dress in the daytime			0
@entity94 , of the @entity95 , said : ' this move to regulate public dress - and to make it a criminal offence to dress inappropriately - represents a worrying move of the state into questions of fashion and mores			0
' there are laws against public disorder - a measure such as this will make the mere showing of cleavage into a criminal offence			2
' and who in the council will be appointed the judge of what is and is not inappropriate dress ? will there be official measures issued for the length of ladies ' skirts ? @entity0 has been trying to change the town 's image			2
earlier this year , tourism boss @entity23 originally said ' kiss me quick , stag and hens ' should ' go somewhere else ' – suggesting @entity27 or @entity28 as alternatives			1
the way @entity0 would like to see itself portrayed - as a glamorous holiday destination @entity0 pleasure beach at night featuring the iconic tower which was opened to the public on may 14 , 1894 and was inspired by the @entity133 in @entity134			2
the @entity135 is 518 feet tall amid an outcry from tourism firms , mr @entity23 later clarified that he only wanted to deter the more unruly groups who behave in a lewd and drunken way , putting off other visitors			2
the town also rebuffed a bid by tv reality show @entity146 to come to @entity0 and restrictions have been placed on its lap - dancing clubs , insisting dancers do not remove all their clothing			1
in a statement , mrs @entity80 said yesterday : ' we have a strong record of tackling anti-social behaviour , however , we know that doing so is a never ending process and we can not rest on our laurels			0
@entity0 's image to the rest of the @entity159 is typified by the hat this holidaymaker is wearing ( file photo ) ' we wo n't hesitate to use and test these new powers to send a message loud and clear ; anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated in @entity0			1
' pspos replace three existing kinds of order : gating orders , which allow for the closure of alleys used for anti-social behaviour ; @entity171 ( @entity172 ) , which allow for the confiscation of alcohol ; and @entity175 , which can prohibit dogs or require that they be on leads .			0
