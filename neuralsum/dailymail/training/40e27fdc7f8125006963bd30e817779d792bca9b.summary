by @entity0 the @entity1 have a score to settle after surrendering the @entity3 back in 2012 after a sensational comeback from the @entity5			1
@entity6 @entity0 gives @entity7 the lowdown on the opposition as he aims to retain the trophy on home soil			1
( top row @entity12 ) @entity14 , @entity15 , vice captain @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , vice captain @entity19 , ( middle row @entity20 ) @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , vice captain @entity26 , ( front row @entity20 ) @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 of the @entity1 @entity3 team pose @entity17 @entity3 record ( @entity34 ) : 3 - 5 - 0 so unorthodox , but you have to say it ’s impressive the way he gets it around			1
do n’t think he will be getting the crowd to applaud on the first tee this week , will he ? it was great last time , though			2
' @entity44 ' @entity17 says he wo n't be goofy in @entity45 @entity31 @entity3 record : debut			1
do n’t know a lot about him , to be honest			2
played with him recently and he seems quiet and shy			2
certainly hits it a long way			2
one of those swings where you would n’t think he ’d be long , but he is			2
plenty of short game , too			0
@entity29 @entity3 record ( @entity34 ) : 6 - 4 - 1 i admire him a lot			1
done it his way since day one			0
shut at the top of his backswing and hits it with a big draw but look how much he ’s won			0
and he ’s like @entity70 in the @entity3 — never knows when he ’s beaten			1
@entity14 @entity3 record ( @entity34 ) : 14 - 18 - 6 the most accomplished member of this @entity1 team			1
i just love the fact he ’s only ever had one caddie and what discussions they have ! sometimes it ’s like they ’re auditioning for the @entity81			0
@entity14 ( right ) and his long - time caddie @entity82 @entity23 @entity3 record : debut			1
reminds me a lot of the young @entity86 in the way he has burst on the scene and looks so at home out there already			0
i think it ’s brilliant the way he keeps churning out results			0
i do n’t think he was ever off a leaderboard for his first 15 months on tour			0
@entity22 @entity3 record ( @entity34 ) : 0 - 1 - 2 can be risky changing your swing but @entity101 has turned it around and @entity22 was just amazing in the majors , with the lowest average score of anyone			1
a gutsy guy and one to watch this week , that ’s for sure			0
patriotic @entity22 has had ' @entity1 ' shaved into the side of his head for the @entity3 @entity18 @entity3 record ( @entity34 ) : 3 - 2 - 2 the 20 - teeth plodder ! sorry @entity111 , i mean it in the nicest sense			1
another who does it his way and another who makes it work			0
hardly ever misses a fairway and while his putting stroke is pretty unique , it gets the job done			0
@entity32 @entity3 record ( @entity34 ) : 9 - 17 - 4 it ’s not going to be easy for him after last time , is it ? there must be some scar tissue in there , but you have to say his play over the last six months has been fantastic			1
relies on his wedge play and there ’s plenty to rely on			0
a dejected @entity32 after his loss on the 18th in @entity136 in 2012 @entity24 @entity3 record : debut			1
i ’ve barely spoken to him but he ’s won three times so he ’s obviously got a very decent game			0
would he hold it against me if i said that claiming to be a world top five player is probably stretching it , though ? @entity15 @entity3 record ( @entity34 ) : 3 - 1 - 0 you wo n’t be surprised to learn i love the fire he brings to the @entity3			1
okay , the caddie went over the top last time , swirling the flag above his head , but @entity15 gets it and that ’s great to see			0
@entity15 practised alongside @entity14 , @entity22 and rookie @entity31 on wednesday @entity28 @entity3 record ( @entity34 ) : 2 - 2 - 0 got ta be honest — i ca n’t remember anything he ’s done this season			1
but he ’s steady , he ’s a major winner and putting is his strong suit , which is never a bad thing at a @entity3			2
@entity25 @entity3 record ( @entity34 ) : 3 - 2 - 3 will be itching to make amends after @entity163			2
an understandable wildcard pick , given he won a tournament this month			0
makes lots of birdies , so watch for him in the fourballs .			0

@entity1 out for *revenge* after @entity5 pulled off the ' @entity173 ' in 2012
this year *'s* @entity3 gets underway at @entity45 on *friday*
