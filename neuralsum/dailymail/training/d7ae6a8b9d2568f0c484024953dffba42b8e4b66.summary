@entity0 is set to launch its much awaited ' @entity2 ' app allowing users to ' undo ' accidental deletes in the @entity5 within weeks			1
the service has already been tested in the @entity7 , but is now about to launch in the @entity5 , according to @entity8 - with an expected price of $ 6.99 per month			1
the paid update is expected to allow allow users to search in other locations , although they may be charged extra for this			0
the function is due to be rolled out in the @entity7 and elsewhere , but will require a premium subscription to @entity2 , which could cost up to $ 20 ( £ 12.50 ) a month @entity2 will be the premium version of the free @entity0 dating app. @entity2 will include an ' undo ' button which will let its users undo their swipes - meaning they can revisit profiles they may have been too hasty to dismiss and swipe left			1
a ' passport ' button will also allow users to search for dates in extra locations			2
currently , the app automatically searches within a certain distance from a user ’s location , whereas @entity2 users will be able to toggle between different locations			2
' both of @entity0 ’s mobile apps recently received updates on the respective app stores where the feature was mentioned in the app ’s update text – hinting at an imminent arrival , ' @entity8 said			2
' however , @entity0 says that @entity2 is not yet being enabled for end users in the @entity5 at this time – and the app ’s update text descriptions will be edited to reflect this			1
' instead , the dating service says its @entity5 launch is still on track for a mid-to - late march time frame			0
' the current version of the free dating app allows users looking for love to swipe right to ‘ like ’ someone and left to pass			0
if both users like each other , they can chat and share photos with each other			0
@entity0 sees more than 850 million swipes and more than 10 million matches made every single day , with 2 billion matches made to date - but so far has not monetised its app. a new version of the app will display a big yellow ‘ undo ’ button on the home screen , which members of @entity2 will be able to use , but regular users of the free version of the app will be able to see – in a bid to lure them into paying for the service			1
the app also plans on launching a button on its home screen called @entity83 , which will let users search for potential dates in extra locations			1
currently , the app automatically searches within a certain distance from a user ’s location , whereas @entity2 users will be able to toggle between different locations			2
the new feature could offer restaurant and sightseeing recommendations in a variety of locations			0
while this feature may well be used by well - travelled bachelors to plan holiday hook - ups , the company hopes it will be useful to people who travel frequently for work and hope to meet the love of their life			0
ceo and president of @entity0 , @entity0 ( who will be leaving the firm as ceo ) told @entity8 : ‘ the most - requested feature we get is a button to go back and have a second chance with people that users swipe left on			1
’ mr @entity121 said : ‘ we often hear that people want to be able to start swiping in a location before they ’ve left to go on a trip or vacation … we also hear people saying that they want to get recommendations for places to go and where to eat in a new city and @entity2 can do better at that			0
’ there is no date when @entity2 will launch in the @entity7 and the trial will only be available to around 40 per cent of users in the first instance			1
@entity0 says this is because it is testing different prices to see whether 99cents ( 62p ) , $ 4.99 ( £ 3.10 ) , $ 9.99 ( £ 6.30 ) , or $ 19.99 ( £ 12.50 ) will be the best fit for consumers			0
‘ we want to find that sweet spot that most users can agree on , ’ @entity121 said .			0
