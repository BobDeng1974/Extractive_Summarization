some days she would eat better than others , so it was hard to tell			0

' i would find it difficult to comment on staff shortages			0
' miss @entity1 replied : ' she had n’t eaten for ten days before that operation			2
' @entity6 coroner @entity78 also heard miss @entity1 had agreed to allow her mother , who had worked at @entity80 in @entity6 for 25 years , to be fitted with a feeding tube before the operation - but it never happened			1
dr @entity84 , a consultant orthopaedic surgeon who treated @entity85 after her second admission , said : ' when a patient has difficulty with oral intake , a tube is one of the ways we give them food			0

@entity156 deteriorated to such an extent that she was taken out on a stretcher and died shortly after			0
when she was admitted to hospital as an emergency case her family claimed she resembled a ' concentration camp victim '			2
recording a narrative verdict the coroner said : ' her basic care and medical requirements were not satisfactorily met and her decreased mobility during her time at the @entity147 increased her risk of developing a chest infection			2
' the @entity140 has fought a long - running battle to improve standards in hospitals and care homes with its dignity for the @entity176 campaign			0
launched in 2002 , it has highlighted public anger over the way elderly people who have worked and saved all their lives are stripped of their homes to pay care bills of several hundred pounds a week			0
