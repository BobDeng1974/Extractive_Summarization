happily ever after : pro-marriage campaigner @entity0 and his wife @entity1 , who argue that policy must be changed to support married couples children are more likely to be in single - parent families in @entity7 than anywhere else in @entity9 , figures have revealed			1
almost one in four live with a lone mother or father , compared to about one in six across the rest of the @entity13			0
@entity7 is now ahead of @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , where the number of youngsters living with just one parent is dropping – or rising more slowly			1
the figures point to the dramatic impact of family breakdown and have been linked to a ‘ meteoric rise ’ in cohabiting relationships			0
a pro-marriage group is calling on politicians to do more to encourage couples to wed – and stay together			0
the @entity29 obtained a breakdown of the most recent figures – for 2012 – from the @entity13 ’s statistics arm @entity32			0
according to its analysis published yesterday , 24 per cent of dependent children in the @entity7 lived in single - parent families – up three percentage points on 2010 and marginally ahead of @entity14			1
the figure for @entity14 , rounded to 24 per cent by @entity32 , was up by just two percentage points since 2010			1
in @entity15 , @entity17 and @entity16 , the percentage fell			0
the only @entity13 country with a higher figure than @entity7 was the eastern state of @entity44 , where sky - high divorce rates have pushed up the number of single parents			1
in @entity7 , by contrast , divorce rates have been falling and family break - up is largely a matter of collapsing cohabiting relationships			2
@entity0 , of the @entity29 , said : ‘ while most lone parents do an amazing job with fewer resources , few have chosen lone parenthood as their lifestyle choice			0
' our research clearly shows that in the @entity7 ’s case – and that of other countries in @entity9 – this rising rate of lone parenthood is a symptom not of a rising divorce rate , but instead by the meteoric rise in the numbers of children brought up by unmarried parents			1
’ he said it was ‘ essential ’ for policymakers to face up to the realities of a generation brought up in single - parent households to avert a ‘ host of negative social and economic implications ’			1
he added : ‘ @entity9 policy must focus on supporting existing marriages			2
being brought up in a stable two - parent household is essential in affording children the decent start in life they deserve			1
’ the number of @entity7 children in lone - parent families rose rapidly in the 1980s , helped by rising divorce rates and increasing numbers of single young women who chose to bring up children alone with help from the benefits system			1
the @entity29 report said : ‘ while the phrase “ lone parenthood ” is a good indicator of the trend , it understates the full extent of family breakdown , as many lone parents go on to form new relationships			0
‘ those who do so have still experienced family breakdown , but are no longer classified as lone parents			0
’ children who have been through break - ups are said to be less likely to do well at school and more likely to suffer from adverse effects such as poor physical and mental health , unemployment and drug abuse and crime			2
couples are married in only 56 per cent of @entity7 families , according to the results of the 2011 national census			1
meanwhile , the number of cohabiting couples with children has risen to more than a million			2
such relationships are estimated to be three times more likely to end in break - up than marriages , and a typical cohabiting relationship that does not lead to marriage lasts no more than three years			0
marriages , by contrast , last 11 years on average and a high proportion of couples are separated only by death			0
@entity134 has spoken regularly about the need to encourage marriage			0
but so far @entity138 ministers have offered only a minor tax break , worth up to £ 200 a year , to lower - income married couples			2
some senior @entity142 , including former chancellor @entity143 , have called for fully transferable tax allowances for married couples with children .			2

in 2012 around 24 per cent of @entity7 children lived in single - parent households
eastern state of @entity44 was only country in @entity9 to have higher figure
campaigners call on *government* to do more to make sure couples marry
