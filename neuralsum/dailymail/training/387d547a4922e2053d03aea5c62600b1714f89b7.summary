by @entity0 when @entity2 was faced with the tragic news of @entity5 ’s suicide , it was his band - mates who rallied around him			1
amazingly , after fifty turbulent years - there have been punch - ups , fall - outs and even affairs with each other ’s lovers - the @entity7 remain tight			1
so as unlikely as it might sound - perhaps there ’s some truth in an unusual theory from dr @entity18 , a doctor of organisational behavior in the @entity20 , that within @entity7 ' bond lies many of the qualities to making relationships last			1
@entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity2 celebrated 50 years together in 2012 ( above ) and are now into their sixth decade her theory , which appeared in @entity20 magazine @entity30 , even sites the band 's many acrimonious moments as being key to their strength			1
' they ’re like brothers who will always be there for each other and at times of tragedy that ’s when you really see them stepping up and expressing that love , ’ dr @entity18 tells @entity45			1
' they have n't always been an example for marital bliss , but couples have a lot to learn from the @entity7 when it comes to how the band members conduct their professional relationships , ’ she says of the rockers now into their sixth decade together			1
‘ the secret ingredient that ’s helped them stay bonded is a priceless lesson for marriage			2
’ @entity2 and @entity5 before her recent tragic death			0
the rocker 's band - mates have rallied around him in his hour of need and luckily dr @entity18 has discovered exactly what that secret ingredient is			1
‘ it 's about prioritising commitment above all else , ’ she explains			2
‘ @entity7 are a perfect example of how you can make a relationship work -- despite anything -- if you are totally committed			0
’ and in their case ‘ despite anything ’ encompasses a fair few misdemeanours			0
they 've slept with each other ’s girlfriends – @entity2 famously had an affair with @entity25 's long - term girlfriend @entity79 , then @entity80 slept with @entity2 's lover @entity81 , which @entity80 admits in his memoir life , was pure retaliation			1
‘ while you ’re missing it , i ’m kissing it , ’ he poetically puts it			0
‘ there ’s been violence and verbal abuse too -- @entity24 punched @entity2 for calling him “ my drummer ” and @entity25 and @entity24 called @entity2 “ that bitch @entity94 ” , ’ says dr @entity18			1
' there were other hurtful moments too			0
@entity2 did a solo deal with their label without telling the band			2
he went on the road on his own and played @entity7 songs , which they saw as riding on the band 's success without them			2
' ' that was really hurtful to the others			0
and when i researched it further i found there was often a clash of egos and a battle for attention and credit			0
' in @entity80 book , life , he 's quick to point out that he created the riff in certain songs and @entity2 just wrote the words			2
he 's constantly trying to even out the perception			2
' ‘ any one of these incidents would be enough to tear most bands apart , ’ dr @entity18 points out , but it ’s their ‘ for better or for worse ’ commitment that ’s kept them together			1
‘ they made a choice … are we going to let these differences break us up ? but they decided “ no ”			0
they ’re totally bonded to each other			0
’ as @entity80 once said , ‘ the @entity7 are bigger than any of us			0
’ ‘ they may have arguments but they know that nothing compares to the magic they create when they ’re together , which none of them could do alone , ’ says dr @entity18			1
famous bust - ups : @entity2 had an affair with @entity25 's girlfriend @entity79 , ( pictured above right with @entity80 and their son @entity147 , ) and @entity80 retaliated by sleeping with @entity2 's girl @entity81 ( above left with @entity2 ) -- but despite it all the band have remained committed to each other in fact , dr @entity18 says the ageing rockers ' many indiscretions have ironically been a source of relationship strength			1
‘ their continual blow - ups have given them countless opportunities to assess and ultimately reaffirm their commitment to each other , which in the long - run has made them stronger , ’ she explains			1
‘ every time their relationship was tested , they remade that choice to stay together			0
' @entity18 ’s theory is backed up by a study in the @entity170 , which found commitment , is more important in a marriage than doing or saying the right thing			1
the @entity7 have stood the test of time and according to dr @entity18 are a great role model for romantic relationships ' the study found that commitment on its own is the number one predictor of marital success			1
if you ’re not committed , you 're not going to do what it takes -- which can mean forgiving and moving on even in the toughest of times			0
' when you ’re committed you need to forgive and forget			0
it 's the strongest predictor of longevity			2
‘ if you do n’t have that commitment , there will always be an easier option			0
when relationships get complicated it takes less effort to leave than to stay			0
' but if you have that commitment ingrained then you 'll do what 's necessary to save it			2
' ‘ what the @entity7 have is like a family love , ’ she explains			0
at times they ’ve driven each other nuts but when it comes to it they ’d do anything for each other			0
as dr @entity18 concludes , ' if all married couples shared their attitude , we 'd see a lot more marriages lasting			1

dr @entity18 says married couples have a lot to learn from the rockers
commitment is the main ingredient that 's helped them into sixth decade
they 've stuck together through many rows and punch - ups
expert says the band have ' for better or for worse ' commitment
