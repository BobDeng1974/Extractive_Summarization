from witnessing the breathtakingly beauty of the @entity2 mountain range to getting food poisoning in @entity4 , @entity5 experienced more than just feats of brilliance while filming @entity8			1
the 31 - year - old co-host of the interactive talent show , which will be broadcast for the first time tonight , travelled to @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity4 and caught up with four people from each country			1
his first stop on the tour was @entity12 , a place he ventured through on planes , trains and bikes and described as ‘ crazy on every single level ’ – a billing that stunt couple @entity28 and mrs @entity29 certainly lived up to			2
discussing the stunt , @entity5 told @entity43 : ‘ the local village came down to watch the event and all of them were really calm – i was this flappy @entity48 bloke who was n’t sure about it			1
‘ i was genuinely worried			2
my facial expression as it is seen on the show was real			2
’ according to mr @entity33 , he approaches the stunt by removing the audience and consequences from his thoughts and remaining calm – a state of mind every @entity12 competitor seemed to possess , remarked @entity5			2
mr @entity33 demonstrated his ability to rest a coconut on his wife ’s throat and slice it in two with a machete mr @entity33 says that he approaches the stunt by removing the audience and consequences from his thoughts and remaining calm @entity64 was also a theme in @entity15 , where @entity5 got to witness what would retrospectively become one of his favourite performances of the series – gaucho cowboy @entity70 performing horse yoga			1
‘ @entity70 was one of my favourite performers for personal reasons – i ’m a bit wary of horses , ' said @entity5			2
‘ his relationship with the horse was just so good , so calming			1
he uses no equipment and never uses violence or a whip , the bond is created by total respect and trust – it was a real moment			2
’ the @entity86 - based presenter even admitted that had he been able to adopt an ability for himself , he would have chosen mr @entity70 ’s , as the skill would impress his partner – a horse enthusiast			1
@entity92 cowboy @entity70 exerted complete control over a horse while performing yoga with it @entity5 admitted that had he been able to adopt an ability for himself he would have chosen mr @entity70 's so that he could impress his partner ‘ it would have to be the horse yoga , even though there are things that were definitely cooler			1
she [ his partner ] would be pleased if she came in and saw me with one relaxed on the floor , ’ he said			2
‘ also , i like the idea of serenity and chilling out , especially as i live in @entity86 , and @entity70 ’s performance was the purest moment of utter serenity			1
’ despite the moments of tranquillity experienced on the trip , @entity5 also endured his fair share of turmoil and a bout of food poisoning in @entity4 certainly took its toll			1
@entity5 said : ‘ we filmed @entity12 and @entity4 together and i was careful that everything was piping hot and that i was n’t going to eat meat in @entity12 – i was militant			1
@entity5 described @entity121 as a real showman and was impressed by his strength and ability the presenter noted that the road had been closed and 500 people had turned out to witness @entity121 's show of strength ‘ so when i got to @entity4 i felt like i had survived @entity12 and paid a hefty price for playing with the rules			1
all i ’m saying is do n’t have the @entity132 in @entity133			2
’ @entity4 however did bring about some of @entity5 ’s favourite moments and he recalls going to visit strongman @entity121 , who holds off accelerating cars and keeps hold off accelerating motorbikes			1
‘ he was one of my favourite spectacles – a real showman			2
he told us that he had spoken to the government and that they were shutting down the roads for his stunt			2
‘ we were dubious , but we drove to the place and there must have been about 500 people , which included police and motorbike gangs outside the town hall			0
pizza freestlyers @entity152 and @entity153 throw pizza dough among the young and hip people of @entity14 @entity5 was impressed by the youngster 's showmanship and stated that he had a ' @entity160 level of attitude ' ‘ there was a lady there who must have been about 700 - years - old , her son , or grandson , [ the performer ] wheeled her to the front and there were motorbikes doing wheelies next to her – i thought she was going to pass out			2
‘ their crowd control was motorbikes doing doughnuts			0
health and safety would never allow that to happen in the @entity178 , but no one was hurt			0
’ moving on to @entity14 , @entity5 found more excitable people and none encapsulated the sentiment more than father and son team @entity186 and @entity153 , the pizza freestylers			0
‘ @entity14 is a really nice place , ’ said @entity5 , ‘ the people look like they have walked out of a beauty advert			0
not sure what to make of it ! @entity5 admits that he was slightly confused by the pizza freestylers ' act ‘ and in the middle of all these young and hip people is a man and his son , who eat a lot of pizza , throwing pizza dough			1
‘ it looked like they were stripping			0
i thought i was having some weird dream			0
part of me felt like it was the best thing i had ever seen and the other part was thinking what are they doing ? ‘ the kid was really working the camera though , with a @entity160 level of attitude			0
’ @entity5 ’s visit to @entity13 also brought about its fair share of interesting characters , and the country itself had a profound effect on the presenter			1
@entity13 performer @entity220 gets into position before head - butting a real nail threw a piece of wood shock horror ! @entity5 recoils after watching mr @entity220 use his head to hammer a nail through a piece of wood he said : ‘ at first i was annoyed that i was going to @entity13 instead of @entity230			1
i am marrying a @entity230 girl and she was saying that i know the country and could do a good job there			0
’ ‘ but @entity13 was so much fun			1
it was a place that really got me			0
not so much @entity237 , but when we travelled to @entity239 we drove through a mountain range and it was just stunning , absolutely gorgeous			1
‘ people say it ’s dangerous but i did n’t experience any of that , just very nice , friendly people			0
’ @entity5 ’s meeting with @entity220 while in @entity13 , however – a man who head - butted a nail into a piece of wood – was less easy on the eye			1
cool under pressure ! in scorching temperature @entity252 performs some controlled @entity255 yoga on a mountain ‘ he was there banging his forehead on this nail			1
i held it and it was definitely a nail , ' said the presenter			0
‘ he was smashing concrete blocks up with his fist , and at the end he was really pumped and grabbed and shook my hand			0
when i took my hand away it was covered in blood			0
’ other performances that caught @entity5 's eye during the series included a man named @entity252 , who performed bike yoga while perched precariously from the side of a mountain in @entity12			1
describing the temperature as ‘ hotter than the surface of the sun ’ , @entity5 explained how mr @entity252 was completely serene as he balanced from his bmx			0
@entity5 enjoying himself by having a few midday drinks with breakdancing group @entity279 in @entity13 a breakdancing group called @entity279 , who the presenter admits getting slightly drunk with in the midday @entity13 sun , also evoked fond memories for the presenter			1
' there were 40 people doing shots of @entity291 , singing songs and dancing			0
it was a crazy atmosphere but the acts were fantastic , ' said @entity5			0
however , not all performance went entirely to plan over the course of the series and a number of incidents saw proceedings become momentarily stalled			0
the performance of a young limbo skater called @entity304 resulted in some off - screen controversy with parents complaining that their children were not picked in place of the youngster			0
young limbo skater @entity304 was eventually able to perform after an argument momentarily hampered the show 's progression ' they were shouting at one another and driving their cars away to prevent him from performing , ' recalls the presenter			2
nature also played its part , with heavy rain in @entity12 temporarily hampering archer @entity321 hopes of competing on the show			0
while rain and wind in @entity15 halted the progression of tightrope walker @entity326			0
in the end however all the performances were completed , and given the complexities involved , the filming of the show was ultimately a success			0
@entity333 with air tonight at 9pm on watch and the first episode will see @entity12 compete with @entity337 for the coveted crown			1
@entity12 archer @entity321 was also able to perform after heavy rain had initially prevented her			0
