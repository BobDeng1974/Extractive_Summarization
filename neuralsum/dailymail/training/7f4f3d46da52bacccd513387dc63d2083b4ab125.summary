by @entity0 published : 14:16 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 02:49 est , 7 march 2013 millions of families were today spared the threat of having to split up their household rubbish into at least five separate bags and boxes			0
a judge rejected a legal bid by the recycling industry - backed by green pressure groups - to enforce rigorous new recycling rules on every home in the country			1
the new recycling regime would have required every council to demand that householders separate their rubbish for recycling into different bins for paper , metal , plastic and glass			0
complicated : seven recycling firms made a legal bid for strict new recycling rules that would force every home in the country to use different bins or bags for paper , metal , plastic and glass - such as this street in @entity34 on @entity35 the system would have meant families would also have had to use yet more bins for food and non-recycling rubbish , and for garden waste			1
seven recycling firms who are part of the campaign for @entity44 - an organisation also backed by environmental groups including @entity47 - said the complicated recycling rules are necessary to meet the demands of the @entity50 's @entity49			1
currently , around four in tens homes in @entity52 and @entity53 have rubbish collection rules in force but in a judicial review heard in the @entity58 in @entity59 , mr @entity56 said it was ' unambiguously clear ' that local councils had a right to set their own rules on how to recycle , based on economic and technical practicalities			1
the decision comes against a background of continuing political tension over how household rubbish is collected			0
local councils , and both @entity71 and @entity72 governments , have faced discontent from voters following the introduction of compulsory recycling schemes			0
these include the notorious fortnightly collection systems and kitchen slopbucket collections in which families can be asked to use as many as nine different bins			0
last month the @entity82 admitted that much of the household waste collected for recycling in fact goes to landfill , and that published recycling figures are exaggerated			0
it acknowledged that a high proportion of rubbish put out for recycling by householders is rejected by recycling processors as too impure for use in processing plants			1
at the same time @entity82 also conceded for the first time that recycling rules have been set out not to meet any @entity98 requirements but to comply with the terms of the @entity101 directive			1
about four in 10 homes in @entity52 and @entity53 already have rubbish collection rules that demand they use separate bins for paper , metal , plastics and glass			0
the recycling firms who brought the @entity59 judicial review said that in order to comply with @entity50 rules householders should be made to ensure that recycling is carefully sorted before it is collected by the binmen			1
waste : @entity82 has admitted that much of the household waste collected for recycling still goes to landfill mr @entity56 said in his ruling : ' they are all members of the campaign for @entity44 , and their commercial interest in this claim is underpinned by a strong belief in the environmental benefits of recycling			1
' local councils have faced discontent from voters over compulsory recycling schemes - such as the kitchen slopbuckets , pictured the companies said the @entity49 , agreed in 2008 and which went into operation in 2010 , sets down that ' waste shall be collected separately if technically , environmentally and economically practicable , and shall not be mixed with other waste or other material with different properties			2
' but the judge said that the primary objective of the @entity50 regulation was the protection of the environment and public health , not the enforcement of separate collection of waste			2
' it would be contrary to principle , and fundamentally incongruous , if the directive were to require separate collection of each of the four waste streams , if such collection were not necessary to achieve the higher objectives of the directive , ' mr @entity56 said			0
' the evidence before me does not begin to justify the assertion that such collection is in all circumstances necessary for the achievement of the directive 's objectives or any of them			0
' the judge refused the recycling companies the right to take their claim to the @entity50 's @entity166 in @entity167			1
a spokesman for @entity82 said after the judgement was made public : ' this ruling shows our interpretation of the @entity49 is right			2
' it recognises that it is for local authorities to decide , within the law , whether separate recycling collections are necessary and practicable			0
' we will continue to work with local authorities , the waste industry and other partners to provide waste services that meet the needs of local communities and improve the quality of recycling			2
