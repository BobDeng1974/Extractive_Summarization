@entity0 may yet change its thinking over the tyre choice for the forthcoming @entity4 @entity3 , but not as a consequence of @entity7 's ' dangerous ' comments			1
@entity0 , the tyre manufacturer , recently announced they would be running the hard and medium compounds for the november 9 race on @entity7 's home turf at @entity13			1
@entity7 , however , slated the plan as ' dangerous , very dangerous ' , and ' totally unacceptable ' given the track has been re-surfaced with a new layer of asphalt this year			2
@entity18 , @entity0 motorsport director , gets a talking to from @entity20 chief @entity19 the @entity4 @entity3 on november 9 is hosted at the @entity13 circuit , which has been resurfaced @entity7 added : ' normally whatever track i go to where they put down new asphalt , it gets even easier on the tyres			1
i have no idea why they choose these tyres			0
' @entity7 's remarks cut little ice with @entity0 motorsport director @entity18 as he told @entity33 : ' that 's a little bit strange as we 've raced before there with the hard tyre			1
' the data would suggest , as it has done for the last three years , it 's one of the more aggressive circuits we have on the calendar , with a risk of blistering problems			0
' we know the soft tyre , with the extreme loads , has potential to blister , so the decision was taken to go with the harder tyre			2
' @entity7 described @entity0 's first choice of tyres for his home @entity3 as ' very dangerous ' @entity18 , though , at least recognised the fact the resurfacing works may have a bearing and is willing to alter the compounds if the data dictates			1
@entity18 added : ' there is one factor , which we need to do a double verification on , which is the surface as they 've now completed a full resurfacing			2
' we 'll do another check with that			0
we have a meeting with the @entity68 , where we have all the tyre experts from all the teams , and we 'll discuss it with them			0
' if there is unanimous agreement then we can reconsider , so we are open to change			0
' but it needs to done on fact , data and details than from a random comment			0
