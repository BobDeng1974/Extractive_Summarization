especially after one incident last year when , after partying until well past midnight , @entity2 , who is suffering from an injured hamstring , skipped out on a saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept , and in turn was fined by the @entity83			1

appearing on @entity94 ’s @entity156 , @entity146 , a noted supporter of @entity2 , did not mince words as he made it very clear that in his opinion the former college star needed to deal with his drinking			0
