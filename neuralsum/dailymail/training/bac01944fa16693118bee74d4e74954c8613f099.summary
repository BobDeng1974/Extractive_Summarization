by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 05:34 est , 13 february 2013 when most of us think of dog photography , it 's likely images of cute puppies play fighting or snoozing in funny positions come to mind			2
but one photographer set himself the challenge of capturing canines at their loneliest and most vulnerable - resulting in this series of strangely poignant images			1
photographer @entity14 spent two years creating a unique collection of images of dogs left alone in cars entitled @entity19			1
poignant : photographer @entity14 has captured a poignant collection of images entitled @entity19 - including this one of @entity22 stuck in the boot of a car eerie : a dog called @entity27 peers out of a misted car glass window in this soulful image here 's looking at you : @entity31 waits expectantly in the passenger seat of a car for his owner to return the series shows the animals peering out of the misted windows of their owners cars , looking sad , lonely and dejected or sometimes alert and expectant			1
@entity14 , who lives in @entity42 with his fiancé and their two dogs , came up with the idea for the series after remembering how he once felt being left alone in a car as a small child			1
while the experience may have only lasted a few minutes , @entity14 recalls how , as a child , it felt as though he may be left there alone forever			1
he said : ' i was once left in a car at a young age			0
' i do n’t know when or where or for how long			0
possibly it was at the age of four			0
perhaps it was outside @entity60 ’s			0
probably for fifteen minutes only			0
the details do n’t matter			0
' the point is that i wondered if anyone would come back : in a child ’s mind it is possible to be alone forever			0
' crossing the @entity67 : the collection of images - including this one of dog @entity70 - has been released as a book in the @entity73 and will shortly be published in @entity74 @entity75 : @entity76 pushes his nose up against a car window as it pours with rain outside @entity80 - eyed : race dog @entity81 appears to have his attention well and truly set on an object outside the range of this picture this brief experience stuck in @entity14 's mind and gave him a ' deep affinity ' to animal suffering			1
but the photographer makes it clear that none of the dogs captured in his series were harmed in any way			1
all of the scenarios captured were merticulously planned and set up in a studio			0
he recruited subjects by approaching dog owners while walking his own dogs			2
the cars used were then picked to ' match ' the dogs			1
he said : ' although bewildered at first , it was incredible to see how many strangers were so eager to help out and let their dog be photographed			0
' after the dog was found , i tried to match the dog to the car			0
people are n't as bothered about seeing their car in a book as they are their dog			2
' angry : this canine called @entity118 looks far from happy at being left alone in a car having a rough time : @entity121 and @entity122 keep each other company after being left together in a car humorous : some of the images , such as this one of @entity127 , are more light - hearted home sweet home : @entity129 appears more than happy in her camper van - viewers can even imagine her sitting back to watch the television each session took him hundred of images and up to four hours to capture a soulful moment			0
@entity14 , who studied psychology at @entity138 and then animation at @entity140 , said : ' the camera is the perfect tool for capturing a sense of silence and longing			1
' two layers of glass are placed between the viewer and the viewed - the glass of the lens , the glass of the picture frame and , in this instance , the glass of the car window further isolates the animal			0
the dog is truly trapped			0
' when i finally took the first picture , i began to understand where it all came from - fears of being alone , unheard , fears of being like an animal with no human voice			0
' the images in this series explore that feeling , both in relation to myself and to animals in general			2
' @entity14 revealed he has suffered from depression in the past and the fear of loneliness is something he is familiar with			1
@entity176 : @entity14 came up with the idea of photographing dogs , such as @entity179 , pictured , left in cars from his own childhood memory of being left in a vehicle alone cute ride : @entity184 takes up the entire front seat of this tiny yellow car driving miss @entity187 : @entity188 waits expectantly for her owner to return so they can get going he said : ' i ’ve suffered from depression on and and off for much of my life and i ’ll place a fair bet that these fears are at the heart of my struggles			1
' but strangely enough i found peering into those cars and seeing the dogs inside somewhat beautiful – as if i was looking into the darkest places inside myself and seeing a face there			1
' when i started this project i knew the photos would be dark			0
what i did n’t expect was to see so many subtle reactions by the dogs - some sad , some expectant , some angry , some dejected			2
' @entity14 started his photographic career after a number of years working as a creative director in children ’s tv			2
dirty drive : @entity215 can be seen through the part of a back windscreen that has been cleaned by a windscreen wiper beautiful : @entity14 said he found taking the pictures of the animals , including @entity223 pictured , strangely beautiful beautiful setting : @entity225 enjoys a whole camper to himself on an isolated beach he was also the recipient of the 2009 @entity228 in the @entity229 for his photograph ' @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 '			1
@entity14 ’s new book of the picture series entitled @entity19 , published by @entity237 , has already been released in @entity238 and rewarded ‘ @entity239 ’ in the @entity240			1
the first edition of the book sold out in six weeks and is now going to be released in @entity74 in early april			2
the collection will also be going on show at the @entity245 in @entity42 this spring from 19 march to 27 april			1
howling mad : @entity118 spent much of his time stuck in the car barking and howling for his owner to come get him riding in the backseat : @entity250 looks as though she is being driven by her chauffeur in this classic black @entity252 heart - wrenching : @entity255 's last eyes appear incredibly hurt and vulnerable in this intimate photograph			0
