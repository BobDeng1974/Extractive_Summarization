@entity0 , 16 months , died at the @entity1 after suffering two cardiac arrests following heart surgery a toddler died after a blood pressure monitor was turned away by a nurse who told her mother that looking at it would ' drive her mad ' , an inquest heard today			1
@entity0 , 16 months , had been admitted to the @entity1 for surgery to widen her aortic valve after she was born with a soft heart murmur and later diagnosed with aortic stenosis			1
she had been diagnosed in may 2013 , when she was a year old , and had been put on a waiting list for surgery			0
but @entity0 , from @entity16 , suffered a cardiac arrest and a pulmonary haemorrhage during the operation in september 2013			1
doctors battled to save @entity0 's life and after some time were finally able to bring her round abandoning the half - finished procedure and returning her to intensive care			1
however , her parents , @entity26 and @entity27 , claim nurses in charge of her care ignored warnings to keep her blood pressure high and ignored their pleas for help when it dropped low			1
mr and mrs @entity0 said they had raised concerns about their daughter 's blood pressure , only for the machine to be turned away from them by a nurse so they could not see it			1
the parents said their daughter had responded well when her neurological function was checked , but doctors quickly placed her back into an induced state			0
within hours @entity0 suffered another cardiac arrest , and despite 40 minutes of @entity51 , doctors were unable to bring her round , and she died			1
reading her husband 's statement at the inquest at @entity56 , mrs @entity0 said : ' i held @entity0 's hand and told her to squeeze mine			1
@entity0 , 16 months , had been admitted to the @entity1 for surgery to widen her aortic valve after she was born with a soft heart murmur and later diagnosed with aortic stenosis ' she gently squeezed my hand and opened her eyes and looked at me			1
then she turned and looked at her mum			0
' she became frustrated with the instruments and the machinery attached to her			0
' she was lively and we were told at that point a doctor hit the muscle relaxant drug button again as he thought her to be too lively			0
' mr @entity72 added : ' we were told by doctors her blood pressure could n't be allowed to drop below 50 , and should preferably be kept above it			1
' her blood pressure often dropped below that but when we told nurses they said ‘ do n’t worry , it ’s fine ’			1
' her blood pressure often dropped below that but when we told nurses they said ' do n't worry , it 's fine '			1
' at this point her blood pressure was around 40 , @entity27 saw it drop to 38 on a number of occasions			2
' when @entity27 voiced concerns again the machine was turned away from her by the nurse who said it would drive her mad			0
' the inquest heard that @entity0 's illness had been detected by doctors in @entity16 when she was just over a year old , in may 2013			2
the toddler was referred to dr @entity94 at the hospital , who added her to his list to perform surgery , and she was given a date of september 9 for the operation			0
the night before the operation , the inquest heard , @entity0 , despite suffering from sweating and panting was her usual talkative self			2
' the evening she was extremely playful , wanting to play with her toys and talk and walk everywhere , ' said mrs @entity0			2
' although @entity0 was initially placed in a room with three beds she was moved to a room on her own as she was talking , singing and wanting to play , keeping the other children awake , " @entity26 added			2
' during this time she never had her blood pressure read , or re-taken			2
' on the day of the surgery @entity0 was sat on my knee singing to me , then we watched a children 's tv programme			2
' earlier this month an inquest into the death of four - month - old @entity118 - @entity117 ( pictured with her mother @entity119 ) , who died at the hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest at her home in 2013 , was told that paramedics had not treated her condition as an emergency @entity0 was taken into theatre at around 9am , but despite showing good vital signs , crashed within minutes of surgeons adding a dye into her heart to assess its output			1
dr @entity94 told the inquest : ' as i was looking at the screen there was a very abrupt change in her @entity138			0
' this usually indicates there is not enough blood getting into her coronary arteries			0
' almost simultaneously upon seeing that i noticed the pressure in her left ventricle dropped to a very low level			0
it was clearly not a very good situation			0
' he added that he had never seen so much blood appear during any similar case			0
it later emerged @entity0 had been given an overdose of two drugs designed to constrict the blood vessels , adrenaline and vasopressin , during her fight on the operating table			0
but , the inquest heard , it was unlikely this caused her second cardiac arrest			0
the inquest was also told that doctors are still unsure as to what caused @entity0 ’s catastrophic arrest			2
' to be frank we were never able to assert the reason she went into cardiac arrest , ' dr @entity94 said			0
the @entity170 are among up to ten families who have called for a public inquiry into care at @entity1 , with the independent review headed by lawyer and healthcare specialist sir @entity177 set to be completed this year			0
@entity0 's is the eighth inquest into the death of a child following cardiac surgery at the hospital			1
earlier this month an inquest into the death of four - month - old @entity118 - @entity117 , who died at the hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest at her home in 2013 , was told that paramedics had not treated her condition as an emergency			1
