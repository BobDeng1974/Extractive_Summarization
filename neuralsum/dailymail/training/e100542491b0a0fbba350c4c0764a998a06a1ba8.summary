a size 30 mother - of - two lost an incredible 9st in 12 months after a festive photo taken last year revealed she was bigger than her christmas tree			1
@entity5 vowed to shed the pounds after the embarrassing snap showed her with a huge stomach , giant double chin and a round face			1
the 43 - year - old , from @entity11 , @entity12 , ditched her favourite pizzas and garlic bread smothered with cheese after her weight crept up to 21st 7lb			1
last @entity29 , @entity5 scrolled through the images on her phone reliving the @entity4 she had just enjoyed			1
but she gasped in horror at a photo her husband @entity34 had taken of her - and vowed next @entity4 would be different			1
now , thanks to that photograph , @entity5 is a size 14			1
she said : ' this will be my first slim @entity4 and i ca n't wait			1
i used to dread finding a party outfit but now i 've had my pick in all the shops			0
@entity5 ( left , before she lost weight ) got even bigger during her two pregnancies , continuing to live of processed food after her children were born , but now ( right ) eats a balance diet of fresh foods ' i was horrified when i saw the picture of me next to the christmas tree but i 'm so glad @entity34 took it			1
it has changed my life			0
confidence is the best present i could ask for			0
' mother to @entity56 , 16 , and @entity57 , 12 , @entity5 says she ca n't remember a time when she was n't overweight			1
' my whole family were food lovers and i grew up enjoying lovely big meals around the table with the family , ' she said			1
' i was always urged to clear my plate and happily obliged			0
' but her waistline suffered and by the time she turned 18 she already weighed 15st and wore a dress size 18			2
she was a size 20 when she met and married @entity34 , 44 , an office manager			2
@entity5 used to over-indulge on a diet high in carbohydrates and processed foods ' my weight did n't bother him at all			1
he loved me as i was so i did n't worry , ' she said			0
then while pregnant with their first child , @entity5 made the most of ' eating for two '			1
' i just gave in to anything i fancied			0
it was like a free pass to eat however much i wanted without feeling too greedy , ' she said			0
their daughter @entity56 was born in 1998 , followed by @entity57 in 2001 and @entity5 's frame continued to grow			1
' eating for two had left me with a bigger appetite than before , ' she explained			0
juggling two children with two jobs , as a hairdresser and a part - time nursery assistant , meant time was short and @entity5 relied on convenience food			1
' i would come home exhausted and tell myself i did n't have time to cook a big meal from scratch so i 'd pop a pizza and some frozen chips in the oven so i could spend time with the kids instead of cooking , ' she said			1
' i 'd always have a second helping too and sides of garlic bread smothered in cheese and would spend as long as possible around the dining table with the family – like i had done as a child			0
' then with the children tucked up in bed @entity5 would drink hot chocolate in front of the television			1
' i was aware i was big but i told myself drinks did n't count			2
' a slice of cake and a few biscuits were an evening treat			0
on weekends she enjoyed carb - heavy breakfasts like crumpets smothered in butter and jam or honey washed down with hot chocolate			0
lunches were always carb - heavy too , usually buttered rolls crammed with cheese and ham , followed by a bag of crisp and biscuits afterwards			0
her job in the nursery meant children often brought in birthday cake to share with the staff and @entity5 found it impossible to resist			1
but she was getting bigger year after year			0
she 'd always loved fashion but found it hard to find anything other than black leggings and black tent - like tops to fit her growing body			0
' i still tried to make an effort with my hair and make - up and i guess to the outside world i was big and bubbly – on the inside i was getting more and more unhappy with my weight , ' she said			2
by december 2013 , her weight had crept up to 21st 7lb			1
her size 28 jeans were bursting at the seams but she refused to buy a size 30			1
more worryingly , she had started to experience breathlessness walking , especially climbing stairs			0
now a keen swimmer , @entity5 has totally transformed her diet and self - confidence and says she is looking forward to her first ever ' thin @entity4 ' this year ( here holding up one of her old skirts ) at the work @entity160 in a restaurant a few weeks before @entity4 she posed in a hat from a cracker while a pal snapped a picture on her phone			1
' i went red when i saw the picture because my face looked so fat and round it might explode			0
i looked rounder than a @entity4 pudding , ' she said			2
but with @entity4 to look forward to , @entity5 pushed dieting to the back of her mind again			1
@entity34 assured her he loved her regardless of her size but @entity5 could see he was concerned about her			1
when he asked her to pose next to the tree on christmas day she recalls feeling awkward and uncomfortable			2
' i hated having my photo taken by that stage but it was @entity160 and i did n't want to make a fuss , ' she said			2
' of course i knew i was big but when i saw it the next day i could n't believe it			2
i looked bigger than the christmas tree			2
' it was the wake - up call she had been waiting for and in january this year @entity5 signed up to the @entity186 weight - loss plan			1
conventional diets had failed in the past because she could n't control her portion size so the plan took temptation out of the way altogether			2
instead of her usual carb - heavy dinners , she enjoyed shakes , soups or bars			0
breakfast : crumpets smothered with jam or honey and a cup of hot chocolate lunch : sandwich with cheese and ham , bag of crisps , biscuits and tea dinner : pizza , garlic bread , chips snacks : cake , biscuits , hot chocolate breakfast : porridge with skimmed milk or a low - fat cereal bar lunch : low - fat soup dinner : chicken breast with steamed vegetables snack : fruit and nuts ' at first i missed food terribly and i thought it was going to be impossible , especially at nursery when the children were bringing in cake , ' she said			2
' but i thought of that picture next to the christmas tree and stuck to the plan			0
' after the first few days i found it easier not to have to think about food because it was out of the equation			0
' she lost 9lb in the first week and it was the boost she needed to keep going			0
as the weight continued to fall off , @entity5 also started walking and swimming to boost her losses , determined to reach her goal by @entity4			1
weekly weigh - ins with her consultant helped to keep her motivated			0
losing a steady 3lb per week , by october she reached 13st 12lb and a size 16			0
she said her daughters brimmed with approval when she picked her @entity4 outfit – a sparkly silver top and skinny jeans			2
' they said i looked great and seeing them proud of me made it worth it			0
i love that @entity34 no longer has to worry about me because i can run up and down the stairs without losing breath now			0
' as @entity4 approaches she has lost even more weight and now weighs 12st 7lb and is a size 14			1
she 's also fulfilled a fashion wish to buy a trendy @entity269 coat			0
' for the first time ever i like what i see in the mirror and it 's all thanks to that photograph , ' she said .			0

@entity5 put on weight during her two pregnancies
continued to overeat a diet of convenience food after children were born
weight continued to rise but she remained in denial until last @entity4
was *shocked* by photo of her looking as big as the tree
*spurred* into action , began a meal *replacement* diet and swimming
dropped from 21st 7lb and size 30 to 12st 7lb and a size 14
