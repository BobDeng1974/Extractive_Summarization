by the time we reach adulthood , our bodies contain 260 bones - all working in unison to help us walk , grip , jump and move around			1
and now a designer has captured these complex joints and motions in a set of mesmerising @entity10 , created using raw x-ray footage			1
the animations reveal how the hand and wrist , elbow , shoulder , knee , foot and ankle work			1
mr @entity22 began by uploading the raw footage to a video editor and trimming the clips so they revealed the precise motions made by the joints			1
this gif shows the movement of the hand and wrist they were created by @entity23 - based designer @entity22 for his client @entity24			1
mr @entity22 began by uploading the raw footage to a video editor and trimming the clips so they revealed the precise motions made by the joints			1
he then removed the individual patient details using @entity42			2
once the clips were selected , mr @entity22 duplicated the frames so they played on a loop			0
' this was an excitement in and of itself as there is not much like it on the web and gave me an opportunity to do something cool , ' he wrote on his website			0
at birth , babies are born with 350 bones which gradually fuse together to complete the adult skeleton of 260			2
bone is a honeycomb - like grid of calcium salts built around protein fibres called collagen			0
this image shows the range of the ankle as the foot points down and up			0
there are almost double the amount of bones in the foot , at 52 , compared to the hand , with 27 elsewhere , the knee joint and movement is captured			1
it shows the hinge joint moving as the leg , consisting of the femur in the thigh , and the tibia and fibula in the lower leg , extend			0
this joint is protected by the knee cap , or patella bone is a honeycomb - like grid of calcium salts built around protein fibres called collagen			2
in one of mr @entity22 's images , he captured the movements in the hand and wrist as the patient made a fist			1
there are eight small carpal bones in the wrist , bound in two rows of four bones each , while each hand has 27 distinct bones that help give it the wide range of motion			1
another image captures the movement of the elbow , as its hinge joint moves the humerus in the upper arm , and the ulna and the radius in the forearm			0
the humerus is then connected to the scapula , or shoulder blade and the clavicle , or collarbone - as seen in the shoulder @entity21			1
this image shows the movement of the shoulder			0
the humerus in the upper arm is connected to the scapula , or shoulder blade and the clavicle , or collarbone another image captures the movement of the elbow , ( pictured ) as its hinge joint moves the humerus in the upper arm , and the ulna and the radius in the forearm elsewhere , the knee joint and movement is captured			2

the final image in this collection shows the range of the ankle as the foot points down and up			0
there are almost double the amount of bones in the foot , at 52 , compared to the hand .			2

the *anatomical* @entity21 were created by a @entity23 - based designer
he edited raw x-ray footage in a video editor and @entity42
movements of the bones were cut into two - second loops
gifs reveal how the hand and wrist , elbow , shoulder , knee , and foot work
