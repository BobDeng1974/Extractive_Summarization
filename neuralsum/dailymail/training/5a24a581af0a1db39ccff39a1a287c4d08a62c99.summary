by @entity0 published : 19:18 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 01:41 est , 5 july 2013 experts once advised people to run for a doorway when the earth begins to shake , now that ’s out the window and scientists suggest jumping under the nearest table			1
but what if the table gives way ? two @entity12 scientist have a solution for that : earthquake - proof tables			1
@entity26 and @entity27 say the idea came out of the pressing need to protect school children in the developing world at risk of death and injury when earthquakes that strike their structurally unsound schools			2
‘ the earthquake - proof table started when i was a student in industrial design at the @entity41 , @entity42 , ’ @entity26 told @entity38			2
‘ at the beginning i wanted a solution to help in natural disasters			0
’ then @entity26 witnessed footage of 2010 ’s catastrophic @entity48 earthquake in which an estimated 200,000 people died as poorly constructed homes and schools easily buckled in the face of the 7.0 magnitude temblor			1
bracing : the earthquake proof table was invented to withstand up to one ton downward impacts and protect those underneath them from temblor - strewn debris in developing countries ‘ i looked at pictures of a school that was crushed in the earthquake in @entity48 and they really shocked me , ’ he said			1
along with his teacher , @entity27 , @entity26 devised a way to prevent such catastrophe			0
the solution is a cheap to make , easy to lift table for school children that can withstand massive impact when used as shelter from earthquake debris			1
‘ when something falls on the table it absorbs the object 's energy , and debris is forced to the side , ’ said @entity26			0
though damaged , the table will protect those underneath from deadly impacts , an idea hatched after its inventors saw the aftermath of @entity48 's 2010 earthquake that killed 200,000 necessary : the table 's inventors say that some 300,000,000 school children attend school in structurally unsound buildings where the tables could save countless lives the tables , when placed in rows like classroom desks , also act as a means of escape			1
with debris halted above , students can crawl through the clear passageways created by the tables , as can rescue workers			2
first tested by the @entity12 military , the desk is now undergoing strict testing at @entity107 ’s structural engineering department in @entity108			0
@entity109 : by creating space between cowering earthquake survivors and fallen debris , the tables also allow for the rescue of children after saving their lives according to @entity26 and @entity27 , some 300 million school children worldwide are at risk from earthquakes because their buildings are n’t prepared for them			1
the team sees their earthquake proof table as a way to prevent deaths and injuries			2
the two have been applauded around the world for their invention and received numerous awards			0
but @entity26 hopes no one ever has to depend on his life - saving invention			0
‘ it 's always a good feeling to be recognised , but really it 's not awards ... we want there to be no earthquakes , and we want it to be used to save lives			0
’ lifesaving : ' when something falls on the table it absorbs the object 's energy , and debris is forced to the side ' says inventor @entity26			0

inventors hope the tables will spare the lives of people caught in unsound buildings during massive temblors like the 7.0 earthquake that leveled @entity48 and killed 200,000
