@entity0 was arrested for being a ' dangerous and suspicious character ' when he was nine , according to newly - surfaced documents from the ' @entity3 ' where he was sent			1
it has long been documented that the jazz great was sent to the home in @entity7 , @entity8 in 1913 and a band instructor there is credited with teaching him the horn			1
but documents , which were salvaged by the son - in - law of the home 's owners and recently released to the @entity18 , have only just revealed his earlier arrest - and have also led to the discovery of newspaper articles written about him more than a century ago			1
nine - year - old @entity0 was nabbed by the police in @entity20 on october 21 , 1910 with five other boys ' for being dangerous and suspicious characters ' , according to a @entity23 report the following day			1
@entity0 is pictured front row center during a 1931 visit to a @entity7 boys ' home formerly known as the ' @entity3 '			1
he was first sent to the home in 1910 when he was arrested age nine former home : he was at the home for two weeks for being a ' suspicious and dangerous character ' and was sent back again for firing a gun into the air in 1913 - during this second stay , he learned the horn he was sent to the @entity3 , an institution for troubled and orphaned children , and was listed as a new arrival with six other boys on october 21			1
in total , there were 77 boys at the home			0
the records shared by the @entity18 show he was discharged to his aunt on november 8			1
interestingly , the boy 's charges appear to change in the documents and he is later noted down as facing a ' pilfer ' charge with a ' pending trial '			0
there is no way of knowing why there was a change but the @entity55 noted that the ' dangerous and suspicious ' charge was often criticized as being an unconstitutional way for police to detain people at will without any evidence of a crime			0
but the 1910 incident was not the only time @entity0 went to the home			2
in an event that has been widely documented - including in @entity0 's own autobiography - on @entity66 in 1912 , he was arrested for shooting a .38 - caliber revolver into the air			1
newspaper articles at the time note he was sent to the home in january 1913 and he was marked as an ' old offender '			0
he remained at the home for 18 months , records show			2
younger years : @entity0 is pictured in 1921 , when he was 20 , with his mother and sister @entity77			0

@entity95 , curator of the @entity96 at @entity97 , pointed out this important difference to the @entity55			0
' the first time @entity0 was in there , there was no band to get involved with , ' he said			2
' it 's almost like he got a second chance			0
' with the help of @entity83 , he quickly picked up the bugle then the cornet and joined band members in performing in parades and picnics around the city			0
in may , four months after he was sent to the home , an article in the @entity23 writes about @entity0 leading the band during a parade			2
' marching proudly through the streets with drum and fife , they rendered several selections , patriotic mostly , and were loudly encored from the sidewalks , ' the article said			0
he was released into the custody of his father in june 1914 - but wrote in his autobiography that he was not happy to leave			0
after his release , he started picking up shows			2
he left @entity7 for @entity80 and then @entity81 , but returned to the city in 1931 , where he visited the home - later known as the @entity130 - and posed for pictures with his former music teacher and the boys			1
music great : @entity0 performs on the @entity136 tv show at @entity137 in @entity138 in june 1967 , four years before his death			2
he had long credited the boys ' home with helping him get his start in music he also grinned in photos beside captain @entity86 and his wife @entity88 , who ran the home and had taken him under their wings when he was a boy			0
' without @entity86 and @entity88 ( @entity152 ) and @entity83 , there probably would not have been a @entity0 , ' their son - in - law @entity149 told the @entity18			1
he went on to send multiple donations to the home before his death in 1971			0
the records were shared by @entity149 , who married the @entity158 ' daughter , @entity157 , and learned of the couple 's connection to @entity0			2
in the 1980s , he came across their records and , thinking of @entity0 , picked out some from 1910 and 1913 and took them with him			0
after moving several times across @entity165 and in the @entity166 , he returned to @entity7 in 2008 and eventually shared the records with the @entity18 , saying other publications had not been interested in them in previous years .			1

it is well documented that @entity0 was arrested for firing a gun into the air on @entity174 , but new records show it was not his first arrest
