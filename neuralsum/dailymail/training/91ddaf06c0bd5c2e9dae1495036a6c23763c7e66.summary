@entity10 has since been photographed leaving their @entity20 home with suitcases before police revealed that they were likely to question @entity25 about the incident			1
in yet another controversy to engulf @entity6 radio in recent weeks , @entity1 - the self - proclaimed @entity27 of @entity28 - was forced to deny she was ' victim blaming ' after receiving a ' torrent of abuse ' from angry @entity10 fans			1
' it ’s hard to look a the photos of @entity10 , her eyes wide with panic , her husband @entity17 ’s hand wrapped around her throat , without feeling revulsion and disbelief , ' she initially wrote			1
' the ‘ domestic goddess ’ is not flirty and fun as fans of her cooking shows know her , but fearful			0
' she went on to ask why @entity10 then posted a ' picture of a buttered , toasted bagel on her official @entity50 page , as though nothing else was on her mind but food ' while the pictures of the apparent row were going viral online			1
' that ’s not the response we were after , @entity10 , ' she added			1
' we think you are strong , beautiful and successful [ ... and ] we do n’t like to think of you cowering from a thug			0
a man so boldly abusive he had no qualms about attacking you in public			0

one wrote on the @entity2 website : ' victims need support not more thuggery at the hands of @entity93 ( jocks )			1
how dare you presume the higher moral ground			0
when will @entity6 radio clean up its act and image - it 's a national disgrace that rubbish like this is allowed			2
' another added : ' i never comment on random internet articles unless i feel really strongly , but this article has really offended me - who are you to tell a victim of domestic violence how she should and should n't behave as a victim ? ' they went on : ' she did n't ask for this to happen , she owes nobody anything			1
it is her husband 's fault for hurting her - where is the blame being placed on him and telling him that we 'll stop providing him with revenue until he ceases to be a violent partner ? awful			0
' @entity1 later sought to dilute her words in a followup statement			1
' first and foremost , my wish for @entity10 is that she is safe and well , and as far away from her beastly husband as possible , ' the @entity2 presenter wrote			2
' the fact that i have copped a torrent of abuse today for urging her to take a stand against domestic violence pales into insignificance compared to what she must be going through			2
