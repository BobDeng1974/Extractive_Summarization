by @entity0 the @entity3 outbreak ravaging @entity4 is ' totally out of control ' and doctors are stretched to the limit in their attempts to respond to the disease , a senior medic said today			1
the current outbreak has caused more deaths than any other on record , said an official from the @entity16 charity			1
@entity3 has been linked to more than 330 deaths in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , according to the latest numbers from the @entity22			1
international organizations and the governments involved need to send in more health experts and increase public education messages about how to stop the spread of the disease , @entity29 , the director of operations for the group in @entity31 , said on friday			2
senior medics have called for more health experts to be flown in and for public safety messages to be increased ' the reality is clear that the epidemic is now in a second wave , ' @entity29 said			2
' and , for me , it is totally out of control			1
' the outbreak , which began in @entity18 either late last year or early this year , had appeared to slow before picking up pace again in recent weeks , including spreading to the @entity20 capital for the first time			1
' this is the highest outbreak on record and has the highest number of deaths , so this is unprecedented so far , ' said @entity58 , a public health specialist with @entity60			1
according to a @entity22 list , the highest previous death toll was in the first recorded @entity3 outbreak in @entity64 in 1976 , when 280 deaths were reported			1
because @entity3 often touches remote areas and the first cases sometimes go unrecognized , it is likely that there are deaths that go uncounted , both in this outbreak and previous ones			1
the multiple locations of the current outbreak and its movement across borders make it one of the ' most challenging @entity3 outbreaks ever , ' @entity73 , a spokeswoman for the @entity22 , said earlier in the week			2
the outbreak shows no sign of abating and that governments and international organizations were ' far from winning this battle , ' @entity80 , head of disaster preparedness and response for @entity83 , said friday			2
a @entity20 nurse at the @entity91 in @entity39 , @entity20 where a nurse reportedly died of ebola virus but @entity29 ' description of the @entity3 outbreak was even more alarming , and he warned that the governments affected had not recognized the gravity of the situation			1
he criticized the @entity22 for not doing enough to prod leaders and said that it needs to bring in more experts to do the vital work of tracing all of the people who have been in contact with the sick			0
' there needs to be a real political commitment that this is a very big emergency , ' he said			0
' otherwise , it will continue to spread , and for sure it will spread to more countries			0
' the @entity22 did not immediately respond to requests for comment			0
but @entity109 , @entity20 's deputy minister of health , said that people in the highest levels of government are working to contain the outbreak as proved by the fact that that @entity20 had a long period with no new cases before this second wave			1
the governments involved and international agencies are definitely struggling to keep up with the severity of the outbreak , said @entity122 , which is providing equipment to the three affected countries and spreading information about how people can protect themselves against the disease			2
but he noted that the disease is striking in one of the world 's poorest regions , where public health systems are already fragile			0
' the affected countries are at the bottom of the human development index , ' he said in an emailed statement			0
' @entity3 is seriously crippling their capacities to respond effectively in containing the spread			0
' the situation requires a more effective response , said @entity29 of @entity60			0
with more than 40 international staff currently on the ground and four treatment centers , @entity60 has reached its limit to respond , he said			0
empty hospital beds at the hospital after nurses and patients fled the hospital due to a number of deaths			2
330 lives have been claimed following the outbreak ' it 's the first time in an @entity3 epidemic where ( @entity60 ) teams can not cover all the needs , at least for treatment centers , ' he said			1
it is unclear , for instance , if the group will be able to set up a treatment center in @entity20 , like the ones it is running in in @entity18 and @entity19 , he said			1
for one thing , @entity29 said , the group does n't have any more experienced people in its network to call on			0
as it is , some of its people have already done three tours on the ground			0
@entity29 said this outbreak is particularly challenging because it began in an area where people are very mobile and has spread to even more densely populated areas , like the capitals of @entity18 and @entity20			1
the disease typically strikes sparsely populated areas in central or eastern @entity4 , where it spreads less easily , he said			2
by contrast , the epicenter of this outbreak is near a major regional transport hub , the @entity18 city of @entity185			1
he said the only way to stop the disease 's spread is to persuade people to come forward when symptoms occur and to avoid touching the sick and dead			0
' there is still not a real change of behavior of the people , ' he said			0
' so a lot of sick people still remain in hiding or continue to travel			0
and there is still news that burial practices are remaining dangerous			0
