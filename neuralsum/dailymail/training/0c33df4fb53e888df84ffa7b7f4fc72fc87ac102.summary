' @entity15 like a p * * * k ' has been set up to let drivers vent their anger on the liberties some road users take when they park their vehicles			1
the public group has so far 245 members who are encouraged to let loose about the ridiculous parking they 've encounter their day and add photographs to back it up			1
good parking is what separates us from the beasts			2
p * * * kery is where humanity and decency begin to unravel			1
' sometimes one parking space is just not enough for some people the bigger the vehicle , the more likely you 'll be to commit a parking crime there are no shortage of people wanting to get parking problems off their chest either			2
' this is my recent collection ranging from @entity59 shopping centre to @entity60			0
these people should be sent to @entity62 during peak hour , ' commented @entity64 , as he shared photographs of more serious parking crimes			2
one of @entity64 's photographs on the @entity10 page shows parking at its very worst another photograph from @entity64 shows a great example of how not to park while @entity72 said that the @entity10 page helped her to deal with her parking rage			1
' check out @entity74 and you 'll never be short of a pic or 20 ! some people are such selfish parkers as i found out yet again at 11pm last night when i got home , ' she commented			0
