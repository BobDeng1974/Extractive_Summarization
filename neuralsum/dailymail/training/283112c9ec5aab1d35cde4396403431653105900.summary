by @entity0 a military fiancée who proudly boasts an ' i love my soldier ' bumper sticker was shocked to find a spiteful letter slapped on her windshield that attacked her and threatened violence for supporting the army			1
@entity11 student , @entity9 , 23 , was in a @entity13 parking lot earlier this month when she found the anonymous note that labeled her a ' b * * * h ' and implied that her future husband , @entity16 , was guilty of committing ' unnecessary murders '			1
the venomous letter personally attacked @entity20 's fiancee for not being the hero she believes him to be and then frightened her when it finished up by calling her lucky , because ' i did n't slash your damn tires ! '			1
' i got in my car and noticed the paper on the windshield , ' @entity20 told @entity48			1
' i drove off in case someone was watching , and then i grabbed it and read it and saw this lovely letter from this person			1
' the vitriolic letter must have been written and posted onto her car in the short time she was inside @entity13 on an errand			1
' so i noticed your ‘ i love my soldier ’ decal , ' it reads			2
' i ’m sure he is your ‘ hero ’ too right ? i feel bad for you and how blind your must be to what is really going on in this country			2
first off he is not a hero			2
your ‘ man ’ is a pawn being used in the immoral game of wholesale murder			2
' happy couple : @entity16 and his fiance , @entity9 ( together , right ) are upset at the response to her proud bumper sticker frightened : as soon as the contents of the letter dawned on @entity20 , she drove away quickly in case she was being watched controversial ? this is the bumper sticker on the back of @entity9 's car the letter closed with this : ' there is nothing heroic about blindly following immoral orders for an undeserved paycheck , especially when such orders involve the unnecessary murder of others ! ! ! ' it ’s people like you and your ‘ soldier ’ who are destructing our country , shame on you b * * * * ! you ’re lucky i did n’t slash your damn tires ! ! ' @entity20 told @entity48 that she was stunned someone would author such a letter			1
' how could someone do this ? ” she said			2
“ i ’m not mad			0
it ’s fine what you believe in and what i believe in , but i ’m not going to hate you for it			0
but to attack somebody else , especially someone close to me , is a different story			0
' this is real , and it happened , and i just do n’t want it to affect another military spouse , ' she added			0
indeed , @entity20 's fiancée has now asked her to remove the i love my soldier bumper sticker because he does n't want her to become the subject of anymore abuse			1
the @entity11 , @entity125 , @entity126 and veteran 's @entity128 member , @entity124 @entity123 said he was disturbed by the whole episode			1
' if they are so concerned , why did n’t they sign it ? ' ' so i noticed your ‘ i love my soldier ’ decal			0
i ’m sure he is your [ sic ] ‘ hero ’ too right ? i feel really bad for you and how blind you must be to what is really going on in this country			0
first off he is not your hero			0
your ‘ man ’ is a pawn being used in the immoral game of wholesale murder			0
if you ’re aware of the real reasons @entity146 goes to war ( corporate profits ) and the role ‘ soldiers ’ play in making such immoral acts possible			0
the last thing you would label a soldier is a hero			0
there is nothing heroic about blindly following immoral orders from a undeserved paycheck , especially when such orders involve the unnecessary murder of others ! ! ! it ’s people like you and your ‘ soldier ’ who are destructing our country , shame on you b * * * * ! you ’re lucky i did n’t slash your damn tires !
