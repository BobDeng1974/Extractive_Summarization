every family has their own approach to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and good nutrition - and the @entity5 are no different			1
appearing on @entity7 this afternoon , the @entity6 revealed all the ways she makes sure her family eats healthily - from making time for sit - down dinners all together to requiring her daughters to finish their vegetables			1

and while she may be in charge of championing healthy eating with her national initiative @entity37 , even the @entity6 has n't always had the best approach to food			1
' i learned from mistakes i made as a busy mom , ' she admitted			1
but when the family pediatrician encouraged her to rethink the foods she and her family were eating , ' we started to clean house , ' she said			0

and the lifestyle changes paid off			0
even @entity5 and @entity15 have come to understand the benefits of eating well			0
' they notice how their performance is affected , ' said mrs @entity19			0
taking action : ' i learned from mistakes i made as a busy mom , ' she admitted			2
but when the family pediatrician encouraged her to rethink the foods she and her family were eating , ' we started to clean house ' let loose : however , the @entity6 is n't completely averse to a treat every once in a while			1
' a treat is a treat , and it 's got to be there , ' she said , explaining that it 's fine to indulge in a few pieces of @entity75 candy however , the @entity6 is n't completely averse to a treat every once in a while			1
' a treat is a treat , and it 's got to be there , ' she said , explaining that it 's fine to indulge in a few pieces of @entity75 candy			0
so when the @entity83 co-host @entity82 told her that she sometimes doles out pencils instead of candy to trick - or - treaters , mrs @entity19 was incredulous			1
' are they sharpened , so they can stab you with them ? ' she joked			0
mrs @entity19 also talked about how cooking at home is a great way to control portions and fight childhood obesity			0
indeed , one thing that helps her make sure that her own family eats a balanced diet is having a family meal every evening at 6:30 , a tradition that she has followed since childhood .			0
