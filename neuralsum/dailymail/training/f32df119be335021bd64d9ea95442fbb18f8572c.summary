by @entity0 published : 18:52 est , 11 june 2012 updated : 05:54 est , 12 june 2012 warning : archbishop of @entity3 dr @entity2 , pictured reading the service of thanksgiving for the @entity6 , has expressed concern at the proposal a law to allow same - sex weddings will destroy the institution of marriage for future generations , leaders of the @entity10 warned yesterday			1
they claim it will lead to a constitutional crisis , arguing that human rights legislation will force churches to treat gay couples asking for a wedding in the same way they treat heterosexual couples			2
the @entity10 ’s warning comes in response to the government ’s consultation on legalising same - sex marriage , which will close this week			1
the proposed reforms , formally launched in march , have been described by @entity10 officials as ‘ half - baked ’ , ‘ very shallow ’ , ‘ superficial ’ and ‘ completely irrational ’			1
they claim the change will lead to the @entity10 separating itself from civil law and leaders say this raises the prospect of ‘ disestablishment ’			2
this would entail the cutting of ties between @entity43 that have lasted for nearly 500 years , threatening a series of major consequences			0
these include the end of the universal right of everyone in the country to marry in their local parish church , to the removal of the @entity54 from her place as @entity56 of the @entity10			1
archbishop of @entity3 dr @entity2 and archbishop of york dr @entity57 wrote to home secretary @entity58 , saying the plans ‘ have not been thought through and are not legally sound ’			1
church leaders have written to home secretary @entity58 objecting to the proposals and dismissed claims by prime minister @entity63 that churches would not be forced to carry out gay marriages they also dismissed as worthless reassurances from prime minister @entity63 that no church will be compelled to provide such ceremonies			1
in the letter they stated : ‘ assurances that the freedom of the churches and other religious organisations would be safeguarded are of limited value given that once the law was changed the key decisions would be for domestic and @entity79 courts			0
’ a gay couple have made history by becoming the first in the @entity83 to celebrate a civil partnership in a religious building			2
@entity86 and @entity87 signed the register at @entity90 ’s @entity89 on the day of their blessing			0
the church received final confirmation from @entity90 council that it could register civil partnerships just a week before the couple ’s big day			0
the legislation to allow religious buildings to host civil ceremonies was implemented in december			0
mr @entity87 , 36 , an administrator , and mr @entity86 , 41 , who runs a youth group , have been together for four and a half years			0
they had originally planned to go to the register office the day before the blessing			0
mr @entity87 said : ‘ bringing the two elements together means we are able to celebrate our love for each other and our love of @entity111			0
’ the @entity10 ’s protest is based on legal opinions saying that under @entity79 human rights law , marriage must be equally open to everyone			1
precedents established in @entity118 say if a country allows gay marriage , then gay couples must have full equality in marriage law			1
church leaders say this means that @entity10 laws which do not allow same - sex couples to marry can no longer remain the law of the land , as they are now			1
nor will churches continue to be able to offer marriage to everyone			0
the constitutional implication is that the @entity10 , whose laws have been laws of the land since @entity137 declared himself its head in 1534 , will have to cut itself away from the state			2
one of the bishops who prepared the @entity10 ’s protest , the @entity141 , the right reverend @entity142 , said yesterday : ‘ marriage is not the property of the @entity10 any more than it is the property of the government			1
it is about a mutually faithful physical relationship between a man and a woman			0
‘ if you do what the government say they are going to do , you can no longer define marriage in that way			0
it becomes hollowed out , and about a relationship between two people , to be defined on a case - by - case basis			0
’ he said this morning that the changes would lead to the ' gradual unravelling of the @entity10 which is a very high cost for the stability of society '			2
@entity165 , of gay rights pressure group @entity167 , said : ‘ there is manifestly no evidence that the recognition of long - term same - sex relationships has any impact on the institution of marriage for heterosexuals			1
’ speaking on @entity176 's today programme , he accused the @entity10 of ' obsessing ' over sex instead of focusing on other issues such as poverty			1
he also described the church 's claims about equal marriage as a ' masterclass of melodramatic scaremongering ' and pointed to new research by @entity167 that 65 per cent of people of faith in @entity83 say gay people should be allowed to marry			1
campaigner @entity190 said : ‘ it is absurd to suggest that allowing same - sex civil marriages would lead to legal challenges that could force churches to marry gay couples			2
‘ civil divorces are legal , yet there has never been a successful legal challenge to religious organisations that ban divorce			0
‘ the courts recognise a distinction between civil and religious institutions			0

gay rights campaigners accuse church of ' obsessing ' over sex instead of focusing on other issues
describes the church 's claims over gay marriage as a ' masterclass of melodramatic scaremongering '
@entity10 says @entity152 's reforms are ' half - baked ' and ' not legally sound '
