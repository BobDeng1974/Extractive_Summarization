by @entity0 in its most hospitable regions , @entity1 shares some similarities with the most extreme regions of @entity5			1
now researchers have shown that some of the simplest and oldest organisms on our planet could also survive on the @entity1 surface			1
named methanogens , these organisms use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to metabolise and produce methane			1
researchers have shown that methanogens - some of the simplest and oldest organisms on our planet - could also survive on the @entity1 surface			1
methanogens in these test tubes , which also contained growth nutrients , sand and water , survived when subjected to @entity1 freeze - thaw cycles at the @entity24 methanogens live in swamps and marshes , but can also be found in the gut of cattle and termites , as well as in dead and decaying animals			1
these ancient and highly - specialised ‘ extremophiles ’ are thought to be able to grow quickly in harsh conditions			0
they are anaerobic , so they do n't require oxygen			0
they also do n't require organic which suggests they could exist in sub-surface environments			0
the survival of these two methanogen species exposed to long - term freeze / thaw cycles suggests methanogens could potentially inhabit the subsurface of @entity1			1
pictured is a microscopic view of a methanogen @entity48 chiefs have said that sending a manned mission to @entity1 is ' necessary if the human race is to survive '			2
but the huge amounts of chemical rocket fuel needed to complete such a mission would require deep pockets – the launch costs alone would be more than $ 12 billion ( £ 7 billion )			0
added to this is the time it takes			0
the space agency estimates that a round - trip human expedition to @entity1 would take more than four years using current technology			2
rocket - powered fusion , however , could one day allow 30 - and 90 - day expeditions to @entity1 by making the trip more practical and less costly , experts claim			1
scientists envision using a nuclear reactor to heat hydrogen to very high temperatures , which will then expand through a spacecraft ’s nozzle to generate thrust			0
recent advances in manipulating nuclear fusion could means that astronauts are now a step closer to our nearest planetary neighbour			0
researchers from the @entity24 wanted to see if two species of methanogens could withstand @entity1 freeze - thaw cycles below the organisms ’ ideal growth temperatures			1
@entity85 was placed in a chamber 55 ° @entity88 ) and @entity87 in one at 37 ° @entity89 )			1
the two species were selected because one is a hyperthermophile , meaning it thrives under extremely hot temperatures , and the other is a thermophile , which thrives under warm temperatures			0
‘ the surface temperature on @entity1 varies widely , often ranging between -90 ° c and 27 ° c over one martian day , ’ said @entity99 , a doctoral student at the @entity24			1
‘ if any life were to exist on @entity1 right now , it would at least have to survive that temperature range			2
‘ the survival of these two methanogen species exposed to long - term freeze / thaw cycles suggests methanogens could potentially inhabit the subsurface of @entity1			1
’ a separate study earlier this month found that superbugs from @entity5 could soon hitch a ride into space , arrive on the red planet and trick scientists into thinking they are @entity116			0
this study was done by @entity48 researcher , dr @entity117 , who expressed serious concern that microbes may beat humans in the race to colonise @entity1			2
dr @entity117 highlighted recent research that showed some bugs were more resilient than first thought and could use protective mechanisms to survive deep space flights			0
currently , spacecraft landing on @entity1 or other planets where life might exist must meet requirements for a maximum allowable level of microbial life			2
these acceptable levels were based on studies of how various life forms survive exposure to the challenges associated with space travel			0
