@entity0 is apologizing after it came to light that the @entity3 - winning actor and director asked that information be withheld from a @entity6 show about his family history			1
after appearing on finding your roots and learning one of his ancestors was a slave owner , @entity0 pushed the network to leave that information out of the program it was first revealed by @entity17 , a request the producers ultimately agreed to			1
this enabled @entity0 to hide the identity of his ancestor , named today by @entity23 as @entity24 , who kept eight slaves on his farm in @entity28 in @entity29 in the 1840s			1
today the actor apologized for asking producers to leave out the name in a post on @entity35 , while also explaining his reasons for his decision			1
' i did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves			1
the very thought left a bad taste in my mouth			0
' @entity0 went on to say he lobbied for that information to be withheld after filming the episode			1
' it 's important to remember that this is n't a news program			1
finding your roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family , making you quite vulnerable , ' he explained			1
' the assumption is that they will never be dishonest but they will respect your willingness to participate and not look to include things you think would embarrass your family			2
' he then added ; ' i regret my initial thoughts that the issue of slavery not be included in the story			0
we deserve neither credit nor blame for our ancestors and the degree of interest in this story suggests that we are , as a nation , still grappling with the terrible legacy of slavery			0
it is an examination well worth continuing			0
' @entity91 genealogist @entity90 is said to have helped trace @entity0 's family tree back to @entity93 , a relative of his father @entity94			1
ms @entity90 told the @entity23 : ' there are lots of farmers in the family			2
@entity99 did n't end in @entity29 until 1846			0
' @entity0 is just one of the many celebrities once again under fire after @entity102 sorted all the hacked @entity104 emails into a system that makes them easier for the public to search			2
@entity6 meanwhile is conducting an internal investigation to determine if this omission violated the network 's editorial standards			1
they have yet to release a statement on their findings			0
after an exhaustive search of my ancestry for " finding your roots , " it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves			1
i did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves			1
the very thought left a bad taste in my mouth			0
@entity130 decided what went into the show			0
i lobbied him the same way i lobby directors about what takes of mine i think they should use			0
this is the collaborative creative process			0
@entity130 agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices i disagreed with			2
in the end , it 's his show and i knew that going in			2
i 'm proud to be his friend and proud to have participated			0
it 's important to remember that this is n't a news program			1
finding your roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family , making you quite vulnerable			1

i am glad that my story , however indirectly , will contribute to that discussion			0
while i do n't like that the guy is an ancestor , i am happy that aspect of our country 's history is being talked about			2
