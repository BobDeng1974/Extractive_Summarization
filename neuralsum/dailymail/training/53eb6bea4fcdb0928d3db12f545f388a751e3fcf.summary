by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 17:35 est , 18 september 2013 dismissed : lord chief justice sir @entity2 , pictured , judged that the claims of sex offender @entity4 had no merit , and that he should be named a child sex offender embroiled a @entity8 battle has been named after losing his fight to remain anonymous			1
@entity10 , who was convicted of nine counts of indecent assault and indecency with a child , was identified today by judges after losing his case			1
he had claimed that being identified would make it harder for him to get work and become a normal member of society - and also that it could identify his victim			2
but judges sir @entity2 and mr @entity24 today slapped down his request and named him in a judgement delivered at the @entity8 in @entity27			1
@entity4 , who was jailed for his crimes in 2007 and released in 2010 , had taken his case to the @entity8 to avoid having to give his bank account details to the authorities			1
because he is on the @entity31 , @entity4 has to provide details of bank , debit or credit card accounts to the relevant authorities to enable them to track him down or investigate any potential offences			0
while his claim was being processed he was granted anonymity by the courts , but the judges said that they ' can not see any basis ' for keeping his identity secret			2
in their judgement sir @entity2 said and mr @entity24 said : ' we are satisfied that nothing set out in this judgment will identify the victim of the claimant 's crime			0
' they added : ' as to the contention that the claimant should be anonymised on the basis that he would be identified as a person on the @entity59 and his rehabilitation impeded , there is nothing in the evidence before us which suggests that there are any special risks to him or to public order by him being identified			0
' as well as revealing @entity4 's identity , the judgement also rubbished his claim that giving his details to the authorities was a breach of his human rights			2
he had argued that handing over the financial information was ' not proprtionate ' , ' not necessary ' , and that it was ' incompatible ' with his human rights , which entitle everybody to a private and family life			0
the judgement was given at the @entity8 , which sits in @entity27 's @entity79 , pictured outlining his case , the judges explained : â€˜ his case is that the requirements ... were an invasion of his privacy as he was concerned that the information might get into the wrong hands or be used by the authorities for some purpose other than that for which it was intended			1
' but they then went on to dismiss his argument , saying : ' we do not consider that the means employed are in any way inappropriate or disproportionate			0
' they are plainly a practical and proportionate means of providing further protection to prevent other persons becoming potential victims of those on the @entity102 [ sic ] register			0

@entity10 was named today when judges slapped down his @entity8 *bid*
convicted sex *criminal* claimed @entity109 - which makes offenders give *police* bank details - breaches his human right to privacy
also claimed being named in the case would make it harder for him to get a *job* and be rehabilitated
but judges said they ' can not see any basis ' for the claim , and that his request for anonymity was also *spurious*
