no tax cut : @entity1 told the @entity2 that the top rate of tax will stay at 45p until at least 2015 the top rate of income tax will not be cut , the chief secretary to the treasury has warned @entity9 mps			1
@entity1 , the most senior @entity10 in the government after @entity12 , said there was ‘ no prospect ’ of the 45p rate being cut in this @entity16			1
he gave a strong indication that the @entity10 would never agree to reduce the rate , even in the event of another coalition government with the conservatives			1
‘ 45p is a good place to be - it is mid-range on international league tables , ’ mr @entity1 told the @entity2			1
‘ my priority is to cut taxes for working people in this country			1
the best way of doing that is to increase the basic threshold			1
’ @entity34 recently said there was ‘ no doubt ’ that chancellor @entity37 would cut the top rate of tax ‘ in this parliament ’			1
@entity41 also suggested he would consider slashing the rate down to 40p if it meant rich people ended up paying more tax			1
the prime minister pointed out that reducing the rate from 50p had actually raised more revenue , as fewer people were trying to dodge tax			1
the coalition reduced the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p in 2012			1
mr @entity41 said : ‘ it just seemed to me that if your top rate of tax is not raising the money that it should , and it ’s holding back the competitiveness of the economy , then even if it ’s politically unpopular to change it , you must do it			1
' i ’m trying to sweep away all the things that hold back the chance of @entity60 being a real success story in the 21st century			2
‘ what we ’ve seen since the change is actually the growth of tax revenues			2
tax rates should be set to raise money , not to send messages			2
i ’m interested in making sure that the rich in this country pay a lot of tax , which they do			2
' they ’re paying a bigger share ... than they were			2
if people can bring forward arguments about how to maximise the revenue from the top rate of tax , i ’m always interested to read them			1
’ but mr @entity1 made clear the @entity10 would block any further cut in the 45p rate , which applies to income of £ 150,000 or over			1
asked if it would go back to 40p , the rate for almost all of @entity85 ’s years in power , he replied : ‘ there is no prospect of that			2
i tell you from me , i am a tax cutter by instinct but i want to cut taxes for ordinary people in this country			1
i am quite willing to ask the wealthiest for a bit more			0
’ @entity9 consensus : @entity41 , left , and @entity37 , right , are both thought to be in favour of a rate cut mr @entity1 suggested he favoured wealth taxes on the richest , but targeted at assets rather than earnings			1
in a wide - ranging interview , he also said that @entity10 who talked of walking away from the coalition before the general election ‘ need their heads examined ’			0
@entity10 grandee sir @entity109 and business secretary @entity110 have both publicly touted a disengagement strategy ahead of polling day in may 2015			2
but mr @entity1 called that strategy ‘ mad ’ : ‘ anyone who thinks that we are going to disengage from the @entity117 before the election needs their head examined			0
‘ every day that the coalition stays strong is a day that the economy gets stronger and we absolutely see that right the way through to polling day			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s insistence that the coalition should stay together is in contrast to mr cable , who at the @entity10 conference said it ‘ was certainly possible ’ that the parties would split before may 2015			0
‘ the idea that somehow it would be to our advantage to walk away from that a few months before the election is just mad , ’ he said			0
‘ we had n’t been in government for 70 years			0
now we are a party of government			0
and as a party of government you do n’t walk away from government , ’ the @entity140 mp said			0
he urged activists to ‘ shout from the rooftops ’ about the role the @entity10 played as part of the government			0
‘ we are an independent party , we have got lots of ideas of our own			0
but we have delivered a lot , we have a record to be proud of			0
people should shout that from the rooftops			0
’ the ambitious father of two - who was also the trusted confidante of former @entity10 leader @entity10 - declined to rule out standing as party leader in future			0
‘ i suppose i am hugely privileged to have the chance to do the job i am doing now and hopefully to make a good contribution to the country			2
who knows what comes after that			0
' ‘ it ’s not something i am spending a lot of time thinking about			0

chief secretary to the treasury told the mail 45p rate is ' a good place to be '
made clear his priority is raising the basic rate tax threshold
