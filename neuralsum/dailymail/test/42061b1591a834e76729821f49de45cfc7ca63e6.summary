@entity0 has been in the commentary game for 40 years , so it 's safe to say he 's witnessed his fair share of blockbusters			1
confessing himself as a ' chief witness ' of football it 's no surprise , then , that when asked to pick a favourite he is able to pluck one game in particular from his encyclopaedic memory			0
' i 've been very lucky to cover so many great games but i do usually plump for this same one , ' @entity0 reminisced with @entity14			0
' @entity15 4 , @entity16 3			2
' @entity17 ( third left ) smashes home @entity15 's fourth past @entity16 goalkeeper @entity19 he is of course referring to the seven goal thriller at @entity23 on april , 1996 , which saw the two @entity26 hopefuls slug it out in order to close the gap between themselves and leaders @entity31			1
' everybody remembers @entity16 going for [ the league title ] but @entity15 were in the mix as well ; and maybe they looked too much at each other because neither of them won it in the end			2
' despite sir @entity41 's @entity31 finishing top of the pile at the end of the season , the game still firmly holds a place in @entity0 's personal archive			2
@entity48 ( second right ) rises above @entity50 to head home the opener for @entity15 @entity48 's early goal began the seven goal spectacle that @entity0 classed as his favourite game @entity56 ( right ) keeps calm under the pressure of @entity58 to slot home @entity16 's second @entity60 ( left ) scored the @entity62 ' first goal and congratulates @entity56 after putting them ahead ' i think if you take all the elements of why we all love football they all happened in this particular game			1
' with @entity15 's potent striker @entity48 breaking the deadlock on the bobbly @entity23 pitch after just two minutes , the outlook looked bleak for @entity16 that evening			1
however , when @entity62 striker @entity60 levelled on ten minutes it began a ferocious exchange between the two sides that few could forget			0
strikes from @entity16 's @entity56 and @entity81 either side of another from @entity48 continued the goalfest and when @entity15 's @entity17 drew both sides level with just over 20 minutes remaining the game was balanced on a knife edge			1
@entity81 ( left ) salutes the crowd after scoring @entity16 's third in the classic match at @entity23 @entity17 ( second right ) is mobbed by his team - mates after all but sealing the win for the home side @entity17 celebrates the win after scoring twice against @entity16 on that memorable afternoon in the dying embers of the match , @entity17 latched on to a ball from @entity95 two minutes into injury time to score the seventh goal of the game ; and @entity0 still remembers the moment the @entity100 went wild			1
' i get goosebumps every time i hear it because it was such a special time			0
' poor @entity105 slumped over the advertising hoardings at the end is one of the iconic shots of the game , perhaps the iconic shot			0
' whatever makes us so addicted to football it was the drug			0

@entity0 revealed 1996 @entity23 thriller is his favourite game of all time
the iconic commentator says the winning goal still gives him goosebumps
@entity15 opened the scoring on two minutes through @entity48
@entity16 equalised eight minutes later after @entity60 's strike
what followed was a seven goal thriller that went right to the wire
it was a chance for both teams to put pressure on league leaders @entity31
