by @entity0 a dog that was almost starved to death by its cruel owner has had to go on a diet - after doubling in weight at an @entity7 rescue centre			1
molly the @entity9 bulldog was virtually skeletal when she was found at a home in @entity12 , @entity13 , and was so thin rescuers did not realise she was pregnant with three puppies			1
she weighed just 20kg and underwent an emergency caesarean and lost one of her puppies , but gave birth to youngsters @entity22 and @entity24			2
but after being taken in by the @entity7 last november , four - year - old @entity26 's weight went up to 38kg			1
from death 's door to diet : @entity26 the @entity9 bulldog was severely malnourished when she was rescued			1
now she is thriving so much @entity7 staff are being forced to cut her calories to help her drop the pounds horrific : @entity26 was just 20kg when she was rescued			1
she was so severely malnourished that @entity7 staff did not even realise she was pregnant with three pups and feared she would not survive until the conviction of her previous , owner @entity26 was classed as a ' case dog ' , and was therefore largely confined to her @entity7 kennel and could n't get much exercise			1
she would also eat anything she could get her hands on because of the neglect she suffered			2
@entity26 has now gone on a diet - but still have some way to go to reach her ideal weight of 25 - 30kg			1
@entity45 , manager of the @entity12 and @entity46 in @entity13 , said : ' when @entity26 came to us , we did n’t even know she was pregnant because she was so thin			1
@entity26 with @entity7 supervisor @entity48			1
her previous owner , @entity49 , of @entity12 , @entity13 , was banned from keeping animals for five years ' you could fit your finger and thumb around her bones			0
it was shocking to see			0
but we ’ve actually had to put her on a diet because she ’s put on nearly 20kg in six months , getting to 38kg at her heaviest			1
' she just loves her food			0
i suppose it was down to lack of nourishment , and she probably did n’t think she would get another meal after what she ’d been through			0
' but we ’re now being very strict with her to get her back to where she should be			2
' @entity26 ’s previous owner , @entity49 , of @entity12 , @entity13 , was banned from keeping animals for five years by @entity67 on june 4			2
the mother - of - ten pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal and was also given a curfew and was electronically tagged			0
@entity45 added : ' when we found her we had to be put her on a drip and we did n’t think she was going to pull through			0
' when we realised she was pregnant , we performed an emergency caesarean and she gave birth to two puppies , but a third sadly died			2
' it was one of the worst cases we ’ve come across			0
' we really did n’t think she would make it			0
she was looked after by the staff here , who cared for her day and night to build her strength			0
' she is an absolutely lovely dog now , and @entity22 and @entity24 are a credit to her			0
' @entity45 said the centre wanted to give @entity26 and her puppies ‘ the perfect home ’			1
he said : ' they need to go to people who have the time to care for them and introduce them to their homes			0
' ' we have had some enquiries already but it will be really sad to see them leave			0
we ’ve all grown really close to @entity26 and her pups			2
' they are all very friendly and have their own unique characters			0
' family : @entity7 staff @entity99 ( left ) with @entity24 the puppy , @entity48 ( centre ) with @entity26 and @entity102 ( right ) with @entity103 the puppy			1
a third puppy sadly died in labour @entity7 manager @entity45 said : ' she just loves her food			1
i suppose it was down to lack of nourishment , and she probably did n't think she would get another meal after what she 'd been through '			0
