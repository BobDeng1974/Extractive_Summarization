coming soon to a plane near you – the mobile phone call			1
for years , aircraft in flight have – with the exception of @entity6 and funerals – been a final refuge from the invasive reach of the cellphone conversation			1
but this state of affairs could be set to change			1
last week , the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) published new guidance for airlines which lifted restrictions on the use of mobile devices during flight			1
will this be a good and wonderful thing – another breezy victory for technology as the age of information marches unstoppably onwards ? or just an extra irritating factor bolted on to the already - really - quite - irritating experience that is air travel in the 21st century ? we can think of a few reasons why it may be the former			1
and lots of reasons why it may be the latter			2
ten reasons why mobile phones on planes will be a bad thing ( 1 ) the ‘ i ’m on a plane ’ conversation at a rough estimate ( ie , i ’ve just made this figure up ) , nine out of ten conversations made on mobile phones are completely unnecessary			1
useful things and @entity61 are rarely spoken on cellphones			2
they are the white noise of modern life			2
so bear in mind that almost every phone call conducted on a plane will go something like the below			1
then bear in mind how annoying this will be if you are sitting in the next seat			2
person calling : hi @entity77 / @entity78 / @entity79 , how are you ? @entity77 / @entity78 / @entity79 : i ’m good			1
i ’m on a plane right now			2
person calling : oh , ok			2
some other question that could definitely wait for a better time			2
@entity77 / @entity78 / @entity79 : not now , no. i ’m on a plane			2
repeat three million times on your flight alone			2
@entity90 crackle : you may be able to talk on your phone soon - but will you be able to hear the other person ? ( 2 ) the quality of the line despite great advances in communications technology , there are frequently occasions when you can be walking in the middle of @entity100 , @entity101 or @entity102 , and still receive a call where all you can hear down the line is what sounds like a double - decker bus reversing over glass , 200 seagulls having a fight over a biscuit , or a cat let loose on yesterday ’s newspaper			1
will the quality of the line be any better when you are not standing at the heart of a major metropolis , but 36,000ft above @entity117 , in a reinforced metal tube ? we ’re guessing ‘ no ’			2
( 3 ) no rest for the wicked if there is one thing that the lengthy international flight has in its favour in the 21st century , it is the fact that , for eight or so hours , you are gloriously unobtainable			2
and with the rest of the world on pause , you can sink back into your seat ( or sit bolt upright in it , if you are flying in economy ) , drink a glass of cheap teeth - staining red wine , and watch whatever ‘ comedy ’ @entity137 has put his name to this month			0
yeah , @entity140 is in it too			0
but what ’s this ? if mobile phones are allowed on board , your e-mails will be permitted too			1
and suddenly , your boss wants you to download that attachment about maximising performance figures , blah blah , something about revenue , blah blah , @entity152 on friday			0
hello that endless pile of paperwork			0
' hello , i 'm on the plane ' : will the use of phones on aircraft merely make other passengers even more irritating ? ( 4 ) ringtones in the night there are many things which can be classified as ‘ all but impossible ’ : running the @entity165 in less than five seconds			1
climbing @entity166 with no arms			0
watching 10 minutes of @entity168 without some weeping tone - deaf idiot from @entity170 declaring that ‘ this is all i want to do , and i ’ll give it one million per cent			0
’ the very idea of ‘ one million per cent ’			1
you can add to this list : ‘ getting any sort of viable sleep in an economy class seat ’			0
but just imagine , for one brief , glorious second , that you have dropped off on your way back across the @entity181			0
you are having a nice dream about chocolate , or kittens , or @entity185			0
and then someone ’s phone starts ringing in a bag in the overhead locker above you			1
and that no - one gets up to answer it			0
not even when it rings for the fifth time			0
now it is not nice to want to throw someone from a moving plane			0
but in certain situations … ( 5 ) the queue for the loo just got longer so you want to have a private phone conversation , even though you are in the middle of a plane cabin , where just the 200 random acquaintances can hear your every word			1
where can you go to say ‘ goodnight squeegee - weegy snuggleboo , i wuv you too ’ to your nearest and dearest without an entire aircraft guffawing ? why has the toilet been in use all flight ? ( 6 ) the guy in front ’s voice in the event that someone does decide to have a full phone conversation while in listening range of 200 strangers , you can guarantee that their voice will not be one that sings blissful melodies on chill - out albums , or features on adverts for spa weekends or luxury toilet paper			1
it will be the nasal equivalent of a small hand drill being used on a blackboard , or 30,000 mosquitos having a ‘ who has the highest whine ’ competition inside your ear			0
oh great , the guy in @entity241 is going to play games for the next eight hours			0
is n't technology wonderful ? ( 7 ) a billion bad photos the advent of the smartphone has freed us all from the evil clutches of old - fashioned cameras and the tyranny of proper photography , and liberated us to take images of whatever we want , whenever we want			0
particularly if it ’s a red - eyed selfie , a rubbish snap of a plate of dinner , or a blurry picture of a cat hilariously being asleep , or something			0
just imagine the wealth of visual brilliance that will flood social media when we are all allowed to take photos from two miles above the earth ’s surface , and post them online immediately ? is it @entity268 ? is that the @entity181 , or is it the back of the seat in front ? did you have your finger over the lens on that one ? # absolutelynobodycares ( 8 ) it wo n’t be cheap for mobile phones to work properly in transit , airlines will have to install extra technology on their planes			1
will they do this out of the goodness of their profit margins – or will the additional cost be added discreetly to your next ticket ? do n’t answer that			0
and just wait until your service provider – never shy of foisting an extra lump sum onto your bill because you downloaded one photo while in @entity294 – works out that you ’ve been chatting in the air			0
hello mr @entity297 , i ’d like to discuss a second mortgage			0
( 9 ) @entity300 requests you know how blood - boilingly annoyed you get when somebody in the office goes around asking if ‘ anyone has a charger for an @entity305 ’ , because he ’s already lost his , despite the phone only being released 10 minutes ago			1
and then does n’t return yours			0
disaster averted : for years , we 've been told that this is what will happen if we use our mobiles while in the air ( 10 ) it means the airlines have been lying to us all this time for the last decade or so , the rhetoric has been simple – we have to put away our phones during flights because they may interfere with the plane ’s communication systems			1
with this has come the unspoken threat – ‘ switch off your phone immediately or this aircraft will – instantly and irreversibly – spiral downwards into the ground , killing all of us on board			1
and you , and you alone , man on phone in @entity334 , will be responsible for this			1
’ turns out this was n’t the case			0
who knew ? three reasons why mobile phones on planes will be a good thing @entity342 : a good reason to make a phone call to anyone ( 1 ) proper arrival times no more will your long - suffering partner have to hang around an airport on the basis that you might arrive at some point in the next four hours			1
a simple ‘ darling , we ’re in an eternal queue above @entity357 , get another coffee ’ will at least reveal where the hell you are			0
( 2 ) no more nasty surprises few things are more worrying than the clang - clang of five ‘ missed call ’ text messages when you return to terra firma			0
what ’s happened ? have i been fired ? are you divorcing me ? is the dog dead ? now , at least you will know of mr @entity369 's tragic departure to the kennel in the sky in good time			1
( 3 ) they will save us all from the thorny issue of bad movies last month , i watched almost half an hour – about 27 minutes , i think – of @entity342 , starring @entity377 , on a transatlantic flight			0
had i been able to use my phone , i would have been spared this horror .			1

new rules mean phones could soon be used on flights in @entity386 *airspace*
discussions also *ongoing* in the @entity33 about relaxation of phone regulations
however , phones on planes may not be *universally* *greeted* as a good idea
