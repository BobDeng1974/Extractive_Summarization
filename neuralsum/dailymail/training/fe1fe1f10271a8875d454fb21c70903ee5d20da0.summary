when the @entity1 play their historic match against the @entity3 in @entity4 on november 1 , they are destined to be at full strength , with all their @entity7 - based players available			1
but there will be a price			2
it was reported in the @entity11 this week that @entity12 have an agreement with @entity15 clubs which will see their @entity1 players released en masse for the clash with the world champions at @entity19			1
even though the fixture falls outside the official test ‘ window ’ , the likes of @entity24 8 @entity25 , @entity28 wing @entity26 and @entity29 ’ utility back @entity31 are all due to be available			1
it was claimed that a deal has been struck by the chief executive of @entity12 , @entity36 captain @entity35 , to secure the services of these players and several others for the high - profile visit of @entity3 , in return for them being sent back to their clubs for the rest of november			1
that would mean they are not able to take part in subsequent matches against @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			2
@entity31 of @entity29 and the @entity1 runs in for a try against @entity54 on saturday @entity26 of @entity28 and the @entity1 scores under the floodlights for @entity28 against @entity57 on friday @entity25 of @entity24 and the @entity1 scored a hat - trick against @entity59 on saturday afternoon @entity60 has been told that a firm agreement is not yet in place , but that talks are on - going			1
it is understood that the @entity64 will not seek to take any action in defence of their @entity67 , governing player release , due to the unique circumstances surrounding the @entity1 - @entity3 fixture			1
on the one hand , this is understandable , to a degree			0
the world governing body recognise the symbolic importance of a @entity3 visit to @entity1 , as it may have a galvanising effect on a potentially vast and largely untapped market			1
for @entity82 and @entity12 , it is reasonable to throw all the autumn eggs into one basket this time , knowing they must put their best foot forward when they have the attention of the nation			1
they can also use the remaining games as opportunities for experimentation			0
and the @entity15 clubs want some payback if they are to release players when they do n’t have to			1
@entity3 will face the @entity1 in a showcase fixture in @entity4 in november @entity35 , the former @entity99 scrum - half , is now the chief executive of @entity12 but long - term , this ca n’t carry on			1
@entity101 is the hottest potato in the game			0
clubs and countries are vying for the same players in a congested calendar			1
the result is bartering and horse - trading , temporary solutions and a patching - up of disputes			0
there needs to be more permanent clarity			0
fixtures must be reduced and ring - fenced			0
test teams should expect access at the right times , but not keep expanding their schedules			0
@entity120 are playing five matches in @entity122 next month , at the end of a shattering season			0
it is money - driven madness			0
play less , pay less , stop haggling , prioritise the welfare of players and their right to represent their country – and do n’t undermine the sport with over-kill			2
as the @entity135 saga rumbles on , it is understood that @entity136 may soon be on his way back from @entity138 to @entity139 , while there has also been speculation about @entity143 ’ future in @entity144			1
neither man has made a substantial impact across the @entity147 , partly due to injuries and irregular selection			2
@entity136 has been strongly linked with the @entity150 and that prospect should appeal to the @entity153 flanker			1
the @entity155 - based region are enjoying a wonderful resurgence – as the only unbeaten team in @entity122 ’s three main leagues – without the cast - list of @entity160 that they had in previous years			0
@entity161 is making waves at @entity163 , as is @entity164 on the wing , allied to the astute control of @entity139 half - backs @entity168 and @entity169			1
the @entity150 have the look of a side who are well coached , which is a tribute to @entity173 and his staff			0
it is also fitting encouragement for @entity177 , the captain who turned down a pile of @entity179 , stayed loyal and is now leading a hungry , upwardly - mobile squad			0
@entity136 could do worse than jump aboard the bandwagon			1
@entity182 flanker @entity136 has been linked with a move away from @entity184 club @entity138 @entity99 scrum half @entity185 is back from a fleeting paternity break to join the start of @entity57 ’ assault on the new @entity190 , at home to @entity192 on friday night			1
the visitors come to @entity194 without the array of international @entity197 firepower at the disposal of some leading @entity184 sides , but they do have two exiled @entity200 , in the towering shape of @entity153 lock @entity202 and the centre @entity204			0
they also have a dangerous flanker , @entity206 , who almost single - handedly ran @entity24 ragged at @entity207 four years ago , before celebrating his @entity209 award with a post-match , pitch - side cigarette			1
it was an indication of the enduring cultural differences within @entity215 rugby , but if he tries to smoke at the ground tonight , the stewards wo n’t stand for it , even if he has just lit up the game … proud father @entity185 posted a picture alongside his newborn son on @entity222 they should have given him a mask and cape for the occasion			1
@entity120 are in meltdown , with backs to the wall , so they ’ve sent for @entity231 to save their skins			0
the maverick playmaker is back from injury and on the bench for saturday ’s dead - rubber @entity237 game against @entity3 and embattled coach @entity238 must hope that the fly - half can deliver an inspirational cameo in his home city of @entity242			2
‘ it ’s an attitude thing , ’ said @entity231 – whose own attitude has been repeatedly questioned in the past			2
‘ the attitude is something we can really pick up			0
’ he ’s right about that one			2
the @entity120 are in utter disarray , so even showing some unity and honour in near - certain defeat would be an improvement			0
@entity231 has returned to the @entity120 squad for this weekend 's test against @entity3 last word – when @entity259 beat @entity29 in the 2012 @entity261 quarter - final in @entity262 , they brought 2,000 supporters to @entity264 and the raucous ‘ yellow army ’ illuminated a drab venue			1
on saturday , there are likely to be around 50 fans from the @entity184 club at @entity270 for the same fixture			2
they have evidently opted to save their travel budget for another occasion , but in many cases , rugby is not doing very well when it comes to enticing visiting spectators			0
kick - off times are becoming more absurd with every passing season – geared towards on - screen viewing figures , not in - ground attendances			0
this sunday , @entity283 face @entity284 at 5.15pm , while the december fixtures announced last friday have @entity28 hosting champions @entity286 at @entity287 at 5.30pm on a sunday			2
these are not fan - friendly times			0
the same can be said for friday - night internationals in particular , not least when they involve crossing the @entity292 in rush hour			0
one theory is that some clubs do n’t tend to bring many supporters with them , so there is no need to cater for their needs – well , they never will if their needs continue to be shamefully ignored			1
former @entity259 forward @entity302 and @entity29 lock @entity304 shoulder to shoulder in 2012			2

@entity12 have an agreement with @entity15 clubs which will see their @entity1 players released en masse , according to reports
@entity24 8 @entity25 , @entity28 wing @entity26 and @entity29 ’ utility back @entity31 are all due to be available
@entity15 players expected to return to their clubs after the *showpiece*
@entity136 may soon be on his way back from @entity138 to @entity139
@entity185 is back from a paternity break to join up with @entity57
needs of supporters continue to be ignored in @entity215 fixture scheduling
