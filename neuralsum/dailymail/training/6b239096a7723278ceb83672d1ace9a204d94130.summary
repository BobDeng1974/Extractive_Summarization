there were plenty of fireworks off the field but precious few on it as @entity6 saw off a cussed @entity8 side but did little to suggest they are gathering enough momentum to mount a serious @entity12 challenge			1
last year ’s beaten finalists have struggled to hit the heights of last season – when they finished second both in @entity16 and domestically – and another display which lacked cohesion for large parts did not provide enormous encouragement that a corner has been turned			2
but they are still in the hunt , and that is what counts			0
a fireworks display lights up @entity26 before @entity6 and @entity8 arrive on the pitch @entity6 full back @entity28 crashes over in the corner for his side 's opening try @entity32 and @entity6 fly half @entity33 kicked 13 points at @entity26 no 8 @entity35 , so disappointing for @entity32 during the autumn , won the man - of - the - match award with one of his best performances of the season while the second half was at least better than the first			1
but the home side ’s failure to secure a bonus - point for the second week running left director of rugby @entity46 deeply frustrated			1
victory at home to @entity50 and away at @entity51 in the @entity52 remains the only sure way for @entity6 to qualify from this pool			1
it is not an easy ask			0
‘ i thought we were patchy today , ’ @entity46 said			0
‘ in the first half we did n’t get into scoring positions often enough and missed some golden opportunities			0
‘ we gave away three or four really bad penalties and spent too long defending			0
i thought @entity35 got better and better as the game went on but we may live to regret not securing a bonus point			1
’ @entity6 number eight @entity35 ( centre ) was a handful for @entity67 defence all night the win moves the @entity70 to the top of @entity72 but , with @entity51 and @entity50 playing on sunday , that position will almost certainly be relinquished when the final whistle blows at the @entity74			1
@entity6 woes were summed up by the torrid afternoon suffered by former @entity32 winger @entity76 , who dropped the simplest of passes after seven minutes with the line at his mercy			2
far more seriously for the 31 - year - old , who has enjoyed an excellent season for @entity6 , he then suffered a nasty clash of heads 13 minutes later and was removed for a @entity86			1
@entity67 substitute @entity87 tries to get an offload away after he is tackled by @entity89 he did not return following several minutes of on - field treatment			0
@entity33 , starting at fly half for @entity6 , kicked two first - half penalties against a sale side showing eight changes – including regular fly half @entity95 being omitted from the squad – after defeat last week ended their interest in the tournament			1
@entity95 remains in contract talks with the @entity103 - based side , with sources close to him suggesting a one - year contract extension is likely			2
@entity8 lost @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 last season but @entity111 is confident of securing @entity95 ’s services			2
@entity6 and @entity114 flanker @entity113 makes a strong run at the @entity67 defence ‘ i ’m very hopeful of @entity95 staying in @entity103 , ’ @entity111 said			1
‘ neither of us have been in a great rush			0
we know where we both stand with it			0
we will be showing a bit of ambition in the transfer market next year			0
we ’re hopeful @entity95 will stay			0
’ @entity125 and @entity126 scored the visitors tries , while @entity6 crossed through @entity128 , @entity28 and the impressive @entity35			1
but no amount of fireworks could light up the latest disappointing performance for @entity6 .			2

@entity28 , @entity128 and @entity35 cross for home side
@entity33 kicked 13 points for @entity6
sale scored tries through @entity125 and @entity126
@entity111 's side deny @entity6 precious bonus point
