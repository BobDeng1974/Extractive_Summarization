by @entity0 a 7 - year - old @entity3 boy 's fight for survival against a cancer rarely seen in children faces even worse odds than most thanks to his mixed @entity10 and @entity11 heritage			1
@entity13 's family is desperately seeking a needle in a haystack donor whose bone marrow matches their ailing son 's , something his mother says is ' worse than a 70,000 to 1 shot			1
' now the boy 's family is in a race against time as they scramble to get all the eligible half @entity29 / half @entity28 individuals tested for their suitably to be donors that they possibly can before time runs out			1
fighting the odds : 7 - year - old @entity13 is fighting leukemia for the second time			0
chemotherapy did n't cure him and now a bone marrow transplant is his only hope searching : @entity39 faces unusually rough odds in his battle because bone marrow donation is far more complicated than blood donation , especially for mixed race people like him @entity39 suffers from acute myelogenous leukemia , a blood cancer that 's rarely seen in people under 45			1
he is now in his second round of chemotherapy to buy him time as family and friends set up bone marrow registry drives across the @entity57 in hopes they 'll find a match			1
' since @entity39 is @entity29 & @entity28 mixed race , he will most likely need a donor who is also mixed race , @entity10 & @entity63			1
# @entity64 , ' reads one of the flyers on @entity67 advertising the many donor events			2
still , the @entity69 face an uphill battle			0
@entity39 's mother @entity71 explained to the @entity72 : ' finding a donor is nothing like matching blood types			1
bone marrow is extremely complex			2
it has to do with antigens / proteins which are located on the surface of the blood cell ( also known as " markers " )			0
a 10/10 marker match is a perfect match			0
' unfortunately for people like @entity39 , nonprofits like the @entity86 have had to fight for years to try and increase awareness of organ and tissue donation for and within minority groups			2
according to @entity13 , the test for potential donors is easy and pain free			0
hopefully for her son , mrs. @entity13 's message will continue to help get half @entity29 , half @entity28 donors to testing drives			1
' it 's a long road , ' @entity13 told the @entity72			0
' a road a second - grader should not have to go through			0
' ' worse than a 70,000 to 1 shot ' : @entity39 's family and friends are desperately seeking an appropriate donor through testing drives but face an uphill battle ' it 's a long road , ' @entity39 's mom @entity71 said			2
' a road a second - grader should not have to go through '			0

@entity112 of @entity113 , @entity3 is battling a cancer rare for a child his age and his *genetic* heritage is making finding a donor *difficult*
@entity39 will most likely need a donor who is also of @entity10 and @entity11 mixed heritage and perhaps specifically half @entity28 , half @entity29
the second grader has already *unsuccessfully* been through chemotherapy once and needs a bone marrow donation to save his life
