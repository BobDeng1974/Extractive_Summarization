by @entity0 published : 19:49 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 19:50 est , 30 may 2012 the single currency crashed to its lowest level for nearly two years last night as @entity3 warned that the eurozone faces ‘ financial disintegration ’			1
in a hard - hitting report on the dire state of the economy , the @entity6 called for drastic action to prevent catastrophe tearing the region apart			1
it proposed that money set aside for keeping debt - ridden governments afloat should now be used to rescue troubled @entity18 banks			1
disintegration : the single currency crashed to its lowest level for nearly two years last night ‘ flexibility and speed are of the essence , ’ said @entity6 president @entity20			1
the desperate rallying cry came amid mounting fears that the banking crisis in @entity27 will cripple the eurozone ’s fourth largest economy and trigger a cataclysmic break - up of the single currency			1
the euro crashed below $ 1.24 against the @entity34 dollar to a level not seen for nearly two years			1
the single currency was also trading below 80p against the pound having lost 20 per cent of its value in the last three years			2
‘ the market has lost confidence in the euro , ’ said @entity38 , a currency expert at @entity41 bank @entity40 in @entity42			2
‘ people are battening down the hatches			2
’ stock markets around the world were on the slide with the @entity51 down 1.74 per cent or 93.86 points to 5297.28 on a punishing day for investors in @entity54			2
@entity55 , a market analyst at @entity56 , said : ‘ without wishing to sound apocalyptic , it does feel as if @entity27 is gradually shuffling towards the abyss			0
' flexibility and speed are of the essence ' : @entity6 president @entity20 ‘ investor confidence wanes by the day , and it could only be a matter of time before the @entity27 government is forced to ask for financial aid			1
‘ this would be an event of a far greater magnitude than the bailouts of @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 , since @entity27 ’s size means it would exhaust @entity18 ’s financial firepower			0
’ the @entity6 said the eurozone bailout fund could be used to help banks directly rather than fund governments			1
it said it could ease pressure on countries such as @entity27 struggling to prop up the banking system			0
‘ to sever the link between banks and the sovereigns , direct recapitalisation might be envisaged , ’ the report said			0
the money would come from the @entity84 , the eurozone ’s permanent bailout fund which launches in july but is currently only designed to lend to governments			0
@entity3 said : ‘ a closer integration among the euro area countries in supervisory structures and practices , in cross-border crisis management and burden sharing , towards a ‘ banking union ’ would be an important complement to the current structure			0
’ it also floated the idea of @entity99 - a move that would see debt issued jointly by all 17 countries in the eurozone			0
the idea is vehemently opposed in @entity105 because it would involve @entity107 taxpayers underwriting @entity69 and @entity27 debt .			0
