by @entity0 published : 16:24 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 16:45 est , 19 march 2013 @entity1 , @entity2 whistleblower and former hospital chief executive for @entity4 , says bullying is rampant in the @entity2 the former boss of a hospital which is being investigated over high death rates today described a culture of ' sheer bullying ' in the @entity2			1
@entity1 , former chief executive of @entity4 ( @entity11 ) , said he was threatened by @entity12 ( @entity13 ) when he flagged up hospital capacity problems			1
the whistleblower , who claimed he was sacked after raising concerns about patient safety , said he felt pressured by officials when he put the hospital on ' red alert ' because it was almost full to capacity			0
he said : ' the response from the health authority was , " this is your problem - you need to meet the targets whatever the demand "			1
' it is a very dangerous thing to be trying to push through targets when hospitals are dangerously over full			2
' mr @entity1 , who was sacked in 2010 for ' gross professional misconduct ' over alleged swearing at a meeting , said he was forced to quit after refusing to meet @entity34 targets for non-emergency patients and was gagged from speaking out as part of a settlement deal			1
he added that in february 2009 he met @entity38 - who has been named interim chief operating officer of the @entity40 - and ' essentially certain threats were made to me like , " if you do n’t deliver the targets then i wo n’t be able to protect you "			1
' in essence there was a lot of pressure to deliver the targets and this was going to reflect on me as an individual if we did n’t meet those targets			1
' at the same time i am asking for a capacity review , for help , and the situation escalated , when the hospital became more and more full more and more threats were made			0
' he said he prepared a presentation for the @entity63 about problems with hitting targets but was ordered to remove any reference to him calling for a capacity review			2
he said : ' if you upset the @entity13 , particularly the one i was working for , there would be repercussions for you			0
you work in that environment as best you can			0
@entity74 chasing : mr @entity1 flagged up capacity problems but said he was told : ' this is your problem - you need to meet the targets whatever the demand ' ' i spoke with other ( hospital ) chief executives and many of them , but not all , concurred with my view of the health authority that they were only ever interested if you ’re going to suggest there is a problem anywhere , and they are very heavy - handed with how that problem is going to be resolved , so threats are made , people are told , " you realise the consequences if this does n’t get done ? "			1
' this is n’t proper management , this is just sheer bullying			2
' the former chairman of the trust , @entity97 , added that there is a culture in the health service of ' making things look good rather than being good '			1
mr @entity97 , who also resigned in 2009 , said the @entity13 deliberately hid financial troubles at the trust from senior @entity63 officials			1
he said : ' for whatever reason , the way the accounting system was running , ( some ) deficits were effectively doubled for a while because of strange quirks in the accounting system			0
hidden : @entity97 , former chairman of the @entity4 , says financial problems in the trust were concealed ' the government realised it , decided to put it right , issued a press release saying : " these are the trusts that are affected , we are going to adjust their accounts by these amounts "			1
' @entity11 should have been on that schedule and should have received compensation from the government circa £ 11 million			0
we were not on that schedule			0
' when i raised it with my director of finance , i was told we were not on that schedule because this trust is not to receive a cash adjustment because the @entity13 did not wish to identify any trusts in the @entity136 as being financially challenged			2
' the very clear implication of that is that the financial distress in @entity11 was being deliberately concealed from the centre to make the @entity13 look good			0
' it is a sign of that culture of not owning up to problems , not being transparent			0
the trust is one of 14 being investigated by health chiefs over high mortality rates in the wake of the public inquiry report into serious failures at @entity151			1
mr @entity97 told the @entity153 : ' if you read the @entity151 report it says things like " bullying , target driven priorities , denial " and it goes on and says this was not only in @entity162 - they collected evidence that it existed elsewhere and i can assure you it existed in this part of the health economy			2
' there is this deeply ingrained culture of making things look good rather than things actually being good			0
' he said that the trust was at ' tipping point ' but was told once again to ' meet targets regardless of demand '			1
he added : ' i was in our situation rooms where staff were desperate for the next bed for an emergency patient and i ’m being told , " treat your non urgent patients "			0
' i found that absolutely scandalous			0
' mr @entity97 told @entity182 that staff were frightened to raise concerns about bullying for fear they might lose their jobs , adding : ' if you look at @entity1 now , he blew the whistle , he has applied for 50 or 60 jobs and not got even one interview			1
' that is the culture you are dealing with here			0
' @entity2 boss sir @entity195 has refused to step down following the @entity197 scandal mr @entity97 said the culture of bullying and fear in the @entity2 can only change if there are changes to the leadership			0
he said : ' there is too much evidence emerging that this was not just @entity162 and you have to look at who sets the overarching culture and that is set by sir @entity195 and i have to say that it is deeply ingrained			0
' i do not think you can change the culture of the @entity2 without changing its leaders			0
' mr @entity1 asked what under fire @entity2 boss sir @entity97 has done in the last six years to promote whistle blowing in the health service			1
mr @entity1 also claimed that @entity38 , the former chief executive of the @entity12 , authorised his pay off to protect herself ' as far as i can see , it is much , much worse now than it has ever been , ' he said			1
mr @entity1 also claimed that @entity38 , the former chief executive of the @entity13 who is now the interim deputy chief of @entity40 , authorised his pay off to protect herself , a claim she denies			1
he said : ' if it is the case that @entity38 is responsible for that payment that is a very serious charge , potentially of misconduct , on the basis that you ca n’t use public money to silence matters of your own misconduct			0
' he added : ' this use of public money to cover up individual failings is a major problem			0
' a spokesman for the @entity13 , now part of @entity240 and @entity136 , said : ' @entity240 and @entity136 , as the successor body for @entity242 , has today presented evidence to the @entity244 ( @entity153 ) on behalf of @entity242 , which challenges the claim by @entity1 , the former chief executive of @entity4 , that he raised patient safety concerns as a whistleblower			1
' the material makes it clear that it was @entity242 , the strategic health authority ( now part of @entity251 and @entity136 ) , which was concerned about patient safety at the trust			2
' the evidence presented to the @entity153 makes it clear that there has never been any finding that @entity1 had raised genuine concerns that would constitute his designation as a whistleblower			2
' now that the compromise agreement between mr @entity1 and his employers , which referred to his employment status and his dismissal , has been set aside the @entity13 is in a position to put its view of events into the public domain which it has not been able to do before			2

@entity1 , a former @entity272 health chief , says bullying is rife
he says those who raise fears over services are threatened to meet targets
the former chairman of the trust also says financial *irregularities* are hidden
