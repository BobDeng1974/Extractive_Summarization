for many , a cross between a spider and a shark would be the stuff of nightmares , while mixing a kangaroo and a mango something someone might dream up after too much cheese before bed			0
but for one enterprising artist these crazy animal mashups have become a virtual reality at least after she used photoshop software to merge creatures together in an intriguing set of pictures			0
@entity17 , 25 , originally from @entity18 , started making the hybrid animals as a way to improve her photoshop skills			1
crazy creature : artist @entity17 created a host of new species , such as this @entity25 - a hybrid of a hamster and hyena - to help improve her photoshop skills stuff of nightmares : many people would find the thought of a cross between a spider and a shark to terrifying to even contemplate hybrid : here ms @entity17 has mixed an eagle with a stag to create this hybrid with both antlers and a beak new species : a sparrow and a tabby cat are usually sworn enemies , but they come together in this hybrid created by ms @entity17 fruity combination : ms @entity17 does not limit herself to animals when coming up with the new species			1
here she has combined a kangaroo and a mango - the @entity49 painstaking work : ms @entity17 works with 20 layers on her pictures to make the combinations between the animals , here a killer whale and a black @entity52 , seemless now she has come up with a set of completely new creatures by merging the cutest members of the animal world with the most ferocious			1
each image can take up to four hours to complete and ms @entity17 , who now lives in @entity62 , @entity63 , works with 20 layers on the picture to make the combinations seamless			0
among her creations are the @entity25 - a hamster and hyena blend , a @entity70 - aka a dog and a vulture , and has even combined a kangaroo and a mango			2
creature discomfort : this cross between a cat and a @entity77 does not look like the friendliest of creatures fierce creatures : ms @entity17 says she enjoys the juxtaposition of cure and scary animals , such as this dog and vulture , which come together to create a @entity70 favourite : ms @entity17 says the combination of a baboon and a sparrow , which she has named the @entity89 , is one of her favourite creations a new class of sheepdog : the artist has named the combination of sheep and dog @entity99 shepherds something to squawk about : what do you get if you cross a panda and an owl ? a @entity105 of course art work : tapirs are known for their protruding snouts , but would one be much use on the body of a shark ? combination : this @entity114 was created from a cat and a beaver by ms @entity17 , who is originally from @entity18 but who now lives in @entity63 the @entity118 @entity119 : here ms @entity17 has blended together a spaniel and a bull juxtaposition : this animal was created using photographs of a hairless sphinx cat and the face of a pig ' i really enjoy the juxtaposition between cute and scary animals , such as a growling wolf on a pygmy marmoset , or a snarling tiger on a baby monkey , ' she said			1
' it ’s hard to pick a favorite , but i really enjoy both the “ @entity89 ” and “ @entity142 ” because they ’re such adorable little birds with such character from the yawning animals			0
' i also really love the @entity143 because the two animals included are so drastically different but go together so well			0
' the idea has legs : each image can take up to four hours to complete , such as this one which combines a sperm whale and a giraffe to make an @entity152 would its bark be worse than its bite ? a cross between a a snake and terrier - @entity157 all creatures great and small : this cross between a a wolf and a finger monkey has been named the @entity164 by ms @entity17 raising a smile : meet the @entity166 , a cross between a red panda and a yak @entity171 dog : here ms @entity17 has merged a @entity172 and a puppy to make the @entity52 enough to make you scream : a cross between a rat and a macaque - also known as a @entity178 @entity179 its teeth : a wombat and a bat combine to form this rather angry looking creature new species : a @entity185 is created by ms @entity17 by splicing a labrador and a buffalo king of the forest : here a bear and a deer are merged to create a creature that would give any hiker who came across it a bit of a fright yawn ! a tired - looking seal and a blue tit combine to create a @entity200 perfect blend ? ms @entity17 says she loves the @entity143 because ' the two animals included are so drastically different but go together so well ' singing for his supper : a chipmunk crossed with a sparrow gives way to this animal open wide : a lion and a llama join forces to become this yawning @entity213 @entity212			2
