thoughts : @entity1 struggled to command the attention of his far - flung terror network @entity1 urged followers not to ' waste our effort ' with attacks on @entity8 , but to focus exclusively on defeating @entity9			1
he plotted to bring down a plane carrying president @entity11 , claiming it would mean the accession of vice-president @entity14 , who was ' utterly unprepared ' for the job			1
the revelations emerged in a cache of letters and documents recovered from @entity1 's hideout in @entity21 and released online yesterday , a year after his death in a raid by @entity24			2
they offer a rare insight into his thinking , with one letter drafted just a week before he died			0
@entity1 was clear he saw @entity9 as his overriding terror target			1
' even though we have the chance to attack the @entity8 , we should not waste our effort to do so but concentrate on defeating @entity9 , which will lead to defeating the others , @entity33 , ' he wrote			1
' any arrow and mine we have should be directed against @entity9 , disregarding all other enemies , including @entity41 , and concentrating on @entity9 only			1
' and his prime target was president @entity11			1
@entity1 ordered two units to be set up , in @entity21 and @entity45 , @entity46 – the home of a major @entity9 base – to attack aircraft carrying mr @entity11 and his vice-president			1
he clearly wanted gaffe - prone mr @entity14 in the @entity50 and said ' the killing … would have a serious impact on the course of the war ' because mr @entity11 was ' the man of this phase '			1
he ruled out targeting @entity56 , then @entity9 defence secretary or admiral @entity58 , then chairman of the @entity60			1
but he made it clear mr @entity14 was to remain unharmed , so lowly did he rate the vice-president			1
@entity89 : ' ( @entity89 ) channel ... falls into the abyss as you know , and lacks neutrality too ...			1
let her die in her anger			0
as for the neutrality of @entity96 in @entity99 , it seems to be in cooperation with the government more than the others ( except @entity89 of course )			1
' @entity104 : ' @entity104 channel is all right ; actually it could be one of the best channels , as far as we are concerned			2
it is interested in @entity73 issues , particularly the journalist @entity111 , who is specialized in terrorism			2
the channel is still proud for its interview with the [ @entity1 ]			0
it also broadcasted excerpts from a speech of [ @entity119 's ] on the fourth anniversary			0
' @entity121 : ' i see that it is like the other channels , but it has a famous program ( @entity126 ) that has some popularity and a good reputation for its long broadcasting time			0
' @entity130 : ' i used to think that @entity130 channel may be good and neutral a bit , but is has lately fired two of the most famous journalists - @entity133 and @entity135 the @entity136			0
' he explained : ' the only time you are allowed to attack the other army vehicles is if those vehicles are going to attack our brothers			0
' in the same undated letter , @entity1 wrote : ' we want to cut the tree at the root			0
' the problem is that our strength is limited , so our best way to cut the tree is to concentrate on sawing the trunk of the tree			0
' here is an example for you , the mujahidin were able to cut the root of the @entity158 tree , and after that , all the branches fell off one after the other			0
' in another missive written on october 21 2010 , @entity1 relished the economic problems hurting the @entity164			0
he said @entity9 was in ' big trouble ' in @entity46 and ' their financial crisis continues '			2
' @entity8 has lowered its defence budget and @entity9 is reducing the budget of the @entity170			2
anyone who knows the world and knows politics knows it is impossible for them to continue with the war , ' he states			0
there are also two references to @entity8 in a letter dated april 26 , 2011			0
addressed to @entity180 , who became @entity73 's number two after the death of his boss , @entity1 claimed @entity8 was looking for a way out of @entity46 ' if @entity73 promised not to target their interests '			2
the documents have been published by the @entity187 , a privately - funded research organisation based at the @entity188 at @entity188			0
must see tv ? : @entity73 has no love for @entity89 and ceo @entity191 , but praised @entity104 journalist @entity111 for his interest in @entity73 - related issues tension : the raid of @entity1 's @entity80 compound was watched by president @entity11 and his closest advisers in the @entity199 of the @entity50 mission : @entity1 was killed during the 40 - minute operation by the elite @entity202 in his @entity80 , @entity21 , compound , seen here watch videos here			1

letters show that terror chief was growing *impatient* with his followers and the ' mistakes ' they made
@entity73 wanted to *assassinate* @entity11 so that an ' unprepared ' @entity14 would take over
terror group planned to spread *propaganda* ahead of 10th anniversary of 9/11 - and *identified* best @entity9 networks to get their *message* out
described @entity89 as falling ' into the abyss , ' and @entity104 as ' all right '
