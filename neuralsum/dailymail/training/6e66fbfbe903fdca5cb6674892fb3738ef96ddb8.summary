by @entity0 published : 09:05 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 11:42 est , 22 october 2013 an adventurous cat has been reunited with her owner after she was found two months after going missing - almost 500 miles from home			1
mystery surrounds how @entity6 found her way from her home in @entity9 , @entity10 , all the way up to @entity12 in @entity13			1
but her relived owner @entity14 thinks her beloved pet may have inadvertently hitched a seven - and - a - half hour ride on a delivery truck			1
she said : ' i could n't believe it when i got the call from the @entity21 ( @entity22 ) up in @entity13			1
found : relieved owner @entity14 , pictured right with son @entity23 , said she could n't believe it when the @entity21 called to say that @entity6 , left , had been found almost 500 miles from home ' they said @entity6 is really underweight but is good in herself			1
' no one knows what might have happened			0
maybe she accidentally got on a lorry or something , who knows			0
' @entity6 was discovered crying in @entity12 by a woman who took her to the nearest @entity21 centre in @entity36 , @entity37			1
staff there looked after the cat by providing her with food and water after it emerged she had lost three quarters of her body weight			0
@entity47 's travels began when @entity14 left her bathroom window open on august 20			1
having fed and watered her three cats by 8.30pm , she settled down for the evening and only realised her black and brown feline was missing the next morning			0
she said : ' every evening i get my cats in before i have a bath			0
however , after i 'd finished , i left the bathroom window open			1
' i must have left the bathroom door open and she must have escaped out of the window			2
' but , much to the delight of her family , almost nine weeks after she went missing , @entity6 was safely returned at 11pm last night by courier			2
@entity60 , assistant manager at the @entity21 's @entity61 and @entity62 in @entity36 , said : ' when @entity64 arrived in our care we scanned her for a microchip			1
' we were very surprised to learn her owner lived in @entity9			0
' we 're not entirely sure how she ended up in @entity12 but it 's possible she jumped in a delivery van or on to a train			2
' @entity6 went missing in august so her owner was understandably delighted to learn she had been found , albeit over 400 miles from home			1
' this is a fantastic example of the benefits of microchipping as it 's highly unlikely we would have been able to trace @entity47 's owner had she not been chipped			2
' after two nights in our care , @entity6 was safely returned back home to @entity9			0
' @entity6 is the second cat inside a week to have travelled north of the border after nine - year - old silver tabby @entity82 was found in @entity83			2
wanderer returns : nine - year - old tabby @entity82 which was found in @entity87 , @entity13 , more than 400 miles from his home in @entity89			0
the curious cat is pictured with @entity91 , 14 , who is looking after him in @entity93 nine - year - old silver tabby @entity82 disappeared from @entity95 , south @entity89 , last october , with distraught owner @entity96 giving him up for dead but last week the cat strolled into a branch of @entity99 in @entity87 , @entity83 , after learning how to activate the automatic door			2
shocked staff only noticed their new guest after he settled down for a nap on an armchair			0
workers handed him in to the @entity108 charity , and when he was checked for a microchip it revealed he was 449 miles from home			0
his owner â€™s mother @entity111 said she could not believe her ears when she took the call - though she admitted that @entity82 - nicknamed @entity115 after a children 's book - has always been a ' character ' .			0

@entity64 went missing after she climbed out of the bathroom window in august
she was found crying on a street in @entity12 almost nine weeks later
the @entity21 was able to trace owner @entity14 through microchip
ms @entity14 believes the cat may have accidentally got on a truck
