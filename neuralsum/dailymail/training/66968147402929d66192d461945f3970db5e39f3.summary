senior bishops have raised the prospect of asking the @entity2 to dissolve the @entity4 ’s ‘ @entity3 ’ , the @entity5 , if it continues to oppose the creation of women bishops			2
the unprecedented proposal was made in a confidential meeting chaired by the @entity11 last week and reflects @entity4 leaders ’ frustration with the @entity5 for narrowly defeating legislation in november to allow women priests to become bishops			1
the @entity17 unveiled fresh plans on friday to push through the historic reforms within two years and is preparing for a battle with traditionalists			1
the archbishop of @entity23 , the most reverend @entity22 held a confidential meeting last week about the issue the archbishops of @entity23 and @entity27 are due to urge the @entity5 , when it meets in july , to accept a law that will allow women to be consecrated			1
but some bishops fear that opposition can be overcome only by dissolving the @entity5 and electing new members who are more sympathetic to reform			0
one senior traditionalist said last night : ‘ it seems the new archbishop is determined to steam - roll this through , but if he is not careful he will be risking another disaster			2
’ the archbishop is to urge the @entity5 to accept a law that women should be concentrated in july as in @entity3 , elections to the @entity5 are normally every five years , but the @entity26 can in theory seek an early dissolution			1
to take this step , they would have to petition the @entity2 , the @entity47 , who has the power to force new elections			0
sources said , however , that the idea had not ‘ gained traction ’ with the majority of bishops because they were confident the @entity5 would not be able to defeat the motion again			0
in november , the reform was defeated despite widespread support by only a few votes in the @entity59 , one of the three houses of the @entity5 alongside the @entity62 and of @entity63			0
sources are confident that the @entity5 , ( pictured ) will defeat the motion as it did in november the fallout was highly damaging to the @entity4 ’s credibility and mps have threatened to impose women bishops by passing legislation in @entity3 if the @entity4 fails to resolve the crisis			0
the @entity5 can reject the @entity26 ’ proposals in july , but observers said the mood is now strongly in favour of introducing women bishops as quickly as possible and that the traditionalists will try only to gain favourable terms .			2
