it was hailed as the first proof of @entity3 exploration to the @entity4 and the earliest known map of the @entity6			1
moreover , the @entity7 was used by some to claim that the @entity8 had discovered @entity4 50 years before @entity9			2
now a @entity11 independent researcher has used simple @entity13 searches to investigate the map and claims to have uncovered new proof that suggests it is an elaborate fraud			1
the @entity7 was uncovered in the 1950s and was hailed as the first map showing the @entity6 ( circled )			1
however , amateur researcher @entity17 has found evidence that suggests it is a fake historians believed the map was proof of @entity3 exploration to the @entity23 before @entity9 @entity17 , 43 , from @entity24 , says the controversial map that has divided experts since it was uncovered in 1957 , was forged and drawn on a 15th century parchment			1
he claims the genuine parchment was stolen and the map drawn on its back was a fake			1
the map emerged on the international book market in the 1950s bound within two medieval documents , the @entity35 and the @entity36 according to mr @entity17 's research , the documents were ironically put on display in 1892 at an event commemorating @entity9 but no record of the map exists			1
he believes this is because it was not drawn until decades later			0
the @entity7 was verified in 1965 by experts from @entity46 and the @entity47 , who said it dated from about 1440			2
it depicted exploration of the east coast of the @entity4 , including @entity52 , @entity53 and the @entity54 in @entity55			0
however , its authenticity was immediately suspected by other academics who questioned where this hugely important historical document had lain hidden for so long			0
mr @entity17 said its display at the @entity9 exhibition in @entity63 is a ' remarkable twist '			2
although archaeologists later found that @entity8 had been to the @entity23 , mr @entity17 's research appears to show that the @entity7 is a fake and was forged on 15th century parchment the @entity24 - based researcher said : ' the historical irony is breathtaking			1
' the aim of the exhibition was to illustrate the richness of @entity73 civilisation around the time of the @entity9 expedition			0
it is evident that there was still no map associated with the documents at that time			0
' mr @entity17 has also uncovered another reference to the two genuine documents , dated from 1926 , in which the map was found			1
he says it was examined by @entity86 priest and scholar @entity85 but again there is no reference to the @entity7			2
the researcher has taken his detective work a step further			0
the @entity93 of @entity94 provided the manuscripts , which contained the map parchment , to the @entity63 @entity9 exhibition			2
mr @entity17 , who is writing a book on the subject , says hundreds of rare books and manuscripts were stolen from the @entity102 in the 1950s - only a few years before the map emerged			1
@entity104 , the @entity86 - based @entity105 dealer who sold the @entity7 in 1957 , was later convicted in connection with the thefts			2
the @entity7 was verified in 1965 by experts from @entity46 and the @entity47 ( pictured ) mr @entity17 said : ' the fate of the @entity111 items raises disturbing ethical questions			1
' many were acquired by respectable institutions which refused point - blank to return them			0
' his claims about the provenance of the @entity7 have intrigued academics , who say they will investigate further			1
@entity121 , the @entity122 's head of cartographical and topographical materials , told @entity124 : ' the map community is taking this seriously			0
' sometimes it takes an outsider to see the obvious			0
' mr @entity17 also believes that the forger of the @entity7 copied the shapes from a 1463 world map attributed to the @entity133 cartographer @entity132			1
he said slight deviations in a 1782 engraving of the @entity136 , which differ from the original , show up in the @entity7			0
despite the suspect provenance of the map , archaeologists have definitively proved that @entity8 settled in the @entity4 as early as the year 1000			0
in the 1960s a @entity142 settlement was excavated at @entity143 in @entity144 by archaeologist @entity145 and her husband @entity146 .			0

@entity7 hailed in 1950s and 60s as earliest depiction of @entity6
@entity7 divided historians with some believing it was genuine
researcher @entity17 uncovered new evidence about its provenance
he said the @entity7 is likely to be an elaborate fraud
says map was drawn on genuine 15th century parchment
