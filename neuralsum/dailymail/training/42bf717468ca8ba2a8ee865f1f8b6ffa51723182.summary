these terrible estate agent photographs showing homes with wild colour schemes , oddly place furniture and even random animals might make you question how the owner ever made a sale			2
the genuine online adverts feature a house with a toilet in the utility cupboard and pictures with family pets and even residents in the frame			1
@entity16 , from @entity17 , stumbled across the awful pictures while looking for a new flat in @entity20 in 2013 and decided to set up a hilarious blog to show friends his discoveries			1
@entity24 : this dog does n't come with the house but wanted to make sure he was part of the picture as he popped up in this living room shot lounging about : this image has all the makings of a classic estate agent picture - except the resident has decided to take a seat for the shot unusual : this house has an interesting downstairs bathroom - it 's in the utility cupboard with a precariously placed washing machine above it ( left ) while this man did n't even have time to wake up before the estate agents arrived to take the picture as he laid in bed ( right ) but the digital media manager ’s @entity49 site went viral after it started to draw in 100,000 hits a day			1
mr @entity16 said : ‘ to begin with i spent a few hours a week searching for funny or bad images for the blog , but since it went viral i am now sent pictures from all over the world			2
‘ i get up to around 100 new images each week - and i have more than 2,000 great images saved for publication			0
‘ the photos i am sent come from websites all over the world - from the @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , across @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and even @entity72			0
a real pigsty : this peculiar room 's main resident appears to be a huge pig , which rests its head on the sofa and lies across a rug while washing is suspended from the middle of the ceiling on an iron bar multi-purpose : the bathroom in this house does n't have to be used for its main function - one can also enjoy sitting in a comfy armchair worried about the suns harsh penetrable rays ? no worries , this kitchen has an outdoor garden table and chairs complete with a parasol caught short : this man appears to have been unable to hold it in as he demonstrated the use of the bedroom 's en - suite bathroom ( far right ) ‘ the intention of the blog is not to ridicule individual agents or agencies - it is a difficult job , and everyone makes mistakes sometimes			1
‘ but if an agent wants to complain about their photograph being used on my website , they would have to admit that it was their photograph , and i think the estate agents prefer to remain anonymous			0
’ some of the pictures include an outdoor picnic table with parasol in the kitchen , a house with four front doors and even one occupant sleeping in bed			2
oops : the kitchen fitters probably had n't planned ahead with this one and barricaded the door in with counters ( left ) while this home has a strange looking hair piece on the table ways to confuse a burglar : this house comes with four front doors so the new owner will have to make sure they have a big enough key chain the owners of this house decided to demonstrate that a couch can be a garden feature as well as household furniture in this terrible estate agent picture conspicuous : this probably was n't the best place to hide a gun when estate agents are coming round to take pictures of your house freaky : this projector room is not for the faint - hearted as it 's surrounded by creepy looking clowns and features in @entity16 's book the clowns are running theme in some of these terrible estate agent pictures - let 's hope the new buyer does n't suffer from coulrophobia ( the fear of clowns ) scary : another frightening room that featured on an estate agent advert was this one with a @entity167 theme - and dolls in plastic cases others show a room with a pig sprawled on the floor as it rests its head on a sofa and another has an armchair and rug in the middle of a bathroom			1
he has now turned the photographs into a book called @entity182 and the @entity63 version flew off the shelves over @entity185 , completely selling out			0
the @entity64 version is set for release in april and mr @entity16 is in the process of producing a 2016 calendar which will be available in the @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity68 and @entity69			0
at least you wo n't get cold feet : this bathroom comes carpeted with a boiler directly above the sink in and a slightly out of place toilet wonky : the photographer could n't quite get the angle on this one as the showroom toilet has not been plumbed in and sits in the middle this photographer has gone for the ' basement in an earthquake look ' with a blurry shot that gives no perception of what the room is really like peculiar : this room once had a roaring fire but has since been replaced with a brand new central heating system ... directly in its place great for the kids : this room has a huge mural painting to @entity215 , but looks slightly out of place with the grown - up bedding ' this place comes with great views ' : one estate agent even had the audacity to take a picture out the window - a string of huge satellite dishes door for @entity226 ? the living room in this house has a slightly unusual entrance with only the top of the door visible from the skirting board i predict a riot : it 's not that easy to make out which room of the house this is - and the upturned furniture does n't give much away either mysterious window : this house comes with large bay windows in the front room which are attractive to small children , according to this advert a real party house : mr @entity16 came across these pictures while looking for a flat to rent in @entity20 in 2013 and decided to put them on a blog to share with friends			1
the blog has now become a best - selling book , which sold out in the @entity63 over @entity185 the photos come from websites all over the world - from the @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , across @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and even @entity72 a small child plays on the front lawn in this picture , which was used to used to advertise the sale of the house - although the child definitely is n't included secret tomb ? this house comes with an ominous looking set of marble cabinets and three mirrors that appear to be built into the walls			0
