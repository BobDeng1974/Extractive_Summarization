' nobody has the right to say whether someone , especially a baby , should live or die			0
' if @entity4 did not want to get involved with the baby he did n't have to and he knew this			1

' @entity7 was to be grabbed , held down and the wheel brace used to cause injuries to cause her to miscarry			2
' but the plot was foiled when the third man contacted police and @entity157 tried to pull out of the sick conspiracy			1
@entity159 , judge @entity51 said : ' you have no previous convictions and are of good character but that is a sham			0
' the victim impact statement shows the very great distress you have caused to this girl			0
' a weapon would have been used and it did not take place through any effort of yours to stop it			0
