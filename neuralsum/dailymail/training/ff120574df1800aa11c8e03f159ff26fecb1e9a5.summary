the man who invented the lithium battery - which now powers almost every portable device on the planet - claims he may have another world - changing invention up his sleeve			1
professor @entity8 first demonstrated that lithium cobalt oxide could be used to create a rechargable battery capable of storing energy in 1979 at @entity12			1
now , aged 92 and at the @entity13 , he is working on a new type of ' super battery ' that could change the way we use electricity			2
professor @entity8 ( pictured above left ) has received honors including the @entity21 from @entity22 , for his role in the invention of the lithium ion battery he claims the development would solve the problem of storing excess electricity produced by wind turbines in heavy winds and also mean solar power could be stored			1
it may also allow electric cars to have ranges that can surpass those powered by traditional fossil fuels			1
an @entity38 company says it has developed technology that can charge a mobile phone in a few seconds and an electric car in minutes			0
using nano - technology to synthesize artificial molecules , @entity43 - based @entity42 says it has developed a battery that can store a much higher charge more quickly , in effect acting like a super-dense sponge to soak up power and retain it			2
the company earlier this year unveiled a slim line version of its battery that can absorb and deliver a half a day 's power for a smartphone in just 60 seconds			0
they hope to improve this so the @entity58 can hold a full days charge in just 30 seconds			0
the innovation is based around the creation of ' nanodots ' , which @entity42 describes as bio-organic peptide molecules			0
nanodots alter the way a battery behaves to allow the rapid absorption and , critically , the retention of power			0
the ever - growing power demands of smartphones could also be met , meaning they could last for days on a single charge rather than a few hours			0
speaking in an interview with @entity76 , professor @entity8 said : ' i want to solve the problem before i throw my chips in			1
' i 'm only 92			0
i still have time to go			0
' professor @entity8 , and his team of engineers , is attempting to crack one of the toughest problems in battery science			1
currently , lithium ion batteries use a metal compound as the positive electrode from which ions flow to a negative electrode made from carbon			1
professor @entity8 instead wants to use pure lithium or sodium metal as the negative electrode			1
this would , in theory , allow batteries to store 60 per cent more energy than current lithium ion batteries			1
that would also mean electric cars - which currently have a maximum range of up to 265 miles on a single charge - could make much longer journeys before needing to be recharged			2
it could also allow new ways to economically store power produced by renewable energy			1
currently , sources such as wind turbines must be ' switched off ' during periods of low demand as the energy they produce can not be stored			0
electric cars like the @entity116 above have a limited range compared to other cars due to the batteries they carry however , using lithium or sodium metal in batteries has proven difficult in the past - these metals are incredibly unstable and catch fire explosively when exposed to water			2
professor @entity8 claims he is on the path towards solving this problem			1
most attempts to improve the performance of batteries have been incremental by tweaking their design to improve charging time and storage			0
mobile phones could last for days and even weeks with new battery technology that can hold more power electric car pioneers such as @entity139 have managed to make improvements and can now achieve a range of around 312 miles from its largest batteries			2
but these are not cheap - costing around $ 100,000			0
other electric cars , like @entity146 's @entity145 , are more affordable but only have ranges of around 120 miles			2
professor @entity8 said that while tinkering with the design of current batteries will bring about some improvements , he believes using all metal electrodes could transform the technology			1
he said : ' you need something that will give you a little bit of a step , not an increment			0
' professor @entity8 was part of the team that first proved that rechargeable batteries could be created using lithium cobalt oxide and lithium metal as the two electrodes			1
the lithium ion battery has allowed electronic devices to become progressively smaller and more portable in 1991 @entity167 combined the lithium cobalt oxide cathode with a carbon anode to produce the first commercial rechargable battery			1
the technology has since allowed laptop computers and mobile phones to become smaller and more powerful			0
professor @entity8 's breakthrough has won him many acolades and regular nominations for a @entity177			2
professor @entity8 wants to create batteries that contain pure metal anodes made from lithium ( above ) he claims scientists like himself have three decades to crack the problem of new super batteries if they want to avoid the impending shortages with fossil fuel energy resources			1
he said : ' we ’re going to have wars on wars fighting over the last reserves of this , that or the other and we ’re going to have global warming beyond anything we can bear			0
' there are a lot of people working , and none of them is stupid			0
i do n’t say i ’m the only one who can solve the problem			0

professor @entity8 is attempting to create a new type of battery
the new battery could increase the amount of energy stored by 60 per cent
he claims it could allow electric cars to compete with fossil fuel *vehicles*
it could also solve the problem of storing electricity from renewable energy
professor @entity8 helped to create the first lithium ion battery in 1979
the technology made it possible to power *personal* electronic devices
without his invention *iphones* , laptops and *digital* *cameras* would not exist
