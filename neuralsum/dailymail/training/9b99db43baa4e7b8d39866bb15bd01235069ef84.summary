@entity0 was eventually released to them and moved to another facility			1
@entity14 said his niece is doing well			0
three doctors and the court agreed she was brain dead and the hospital applied to turn off her life support machine			1
hope : @entity0 's family are certain that she will one day recover despite the hospital 's insistence there is no chance of that happening but her family , led by @entity0 ’s uncle @entity14 , refused to accept the prognosis and argued there was still a chance she could recover			1

' this is a deceased young woman , ' @entity56 spokesman @entity58 said			2
' no amount of food , medicine , medical machinery , time or hope is going to bring back her back			0

' @entity0 is still sleep but physically stable ! no pic lines , no catheters , no @entity100 , she maintains all her vitals on her own , no medicines needed			2
i am giving her lots of vitamins and fish oil thru her feeding tube			0
she moves around so much that we have to put pillows around her bed			0
she responds to pain , cold and touch			0
she can turn her head from left to right and her ventilator is set to room air so she is not getting any extra oxygen like she was before			2
her skin is flawless and she gets a mani and pedi every week done by me ( mom ) she gets physical therapy three times a week and never has a stiff joint ! all organs are healthy and fully functional ! she is such a fighter ! remember she did n't get any nutrition for 28 days from the other hospital and she recovered from that quickly			0
