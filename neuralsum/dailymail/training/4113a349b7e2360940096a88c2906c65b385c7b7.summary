by @entity0 published : 16:38 est , 9 november 2013 updated : 16:38 est , 9 november 2013 @entity1 raised questions saturday about whether a proposed deal to temporarily curb @entity5 's nuclear program went far enough , complicating negotiations with the @entity5 and casting doubt on whether an agreement could be reached during the current round of negotiations			1
chances of that appeared to diminish as the day went on			0
a @entity14 diplomat in @entity15 for the talks told @entity0 said it appeared that a new round of talks would be needed to agree on all points of a start - up deal meant to lead to a comprehensive agreement to ensure that @entity23 's nuclear work remains peaceful			1
in talks : @entity26 secretary of state @entity25 seen outside @entity27 where talks about @entity5 's nuclear program are ongoing same side : @entity26 secretary of state @entity25 ( left ) meets with @entity31 's foreign minister @entity30 during the @entity5 nuclear talks in @entity15 , on november 9 he said preparations were being made by both sides for an announcement later in the day of a new meeting within a few weeks			1
he said earlier that the @entity1 were holding out for conditions on the @entity5 tougher than those agreed to by the @entity26 and @entity1 's other negotiating partners , diminishing hopes of a done deal saturday			2
but the talks in @entity15 were still underway , with @entity26 secretary of state @entity25 , @entity44 foreign policy chief @entity43 , and foreign ministers from @entity46 , @entity1 , @entity47 and @entity31 holding meetings with @entity5 foreign minister @entity49			1
@entity1 foreign minister @entity50 spoke of ' several points that ... we 're not satisfied with compared to the initial text , ' telling @entity1 - @entity54 his country did not want to be part of a ' con game			1
' he did not specify , but his comments suggested @entity1 thought a final draft of any first - step deal was too favorable to @entity5			2
concerns also were raised by @entity62 and a number of prominent figures in the @entity65			0
the @entity1 position was confirmed by another @entity14 diplomat			0
@entity68 gave specifics and demanded anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the diplomatic maneuvering			0
@entity50 ' remarks were the first to provide some specifics on the obstacles at the @entity15 talks , now in their third day			0
he spoke by telephone from @entity15			0
negotiations : @entity5 foreign minister @entity49 ( left ) and @entity78 for foreign affairs @entity43 ( right ) speak together during the third day of closed - door nuclear talks in @entity15 on saturday @entity50 mentioned differences over @entity5 's @entity83 reactor southeast of @entity23 , which could produce enough plutonium for several nuclear weapons a year once it goes online			1
he also said there was disagreement over efforts to limit @entity5 's uranium enrichment to levels that would require substantial further enriching before they could be used as the fissile core of a nuclear weapon			2
@entity1 @entity96 spokesman @entity95 pointed to ' rather large cohesion ' among the negotiators and said @entity1 wanted ' the international community to see a serious change in the climate ' of talks with @entity5			2
' there have been years of talks that have led to nothing , ' @entity95 said , alluding to the need for tough terms on @entity5			0
@entity5 , which denies any interest in nuclear weapons , currently runs more than 10,000 centrifuges that have created tons of fuel - grade material that can be further enriched to arm nuclear warheads			1
it also has nearly 440 pounds ( 200 kilograms ) of higher - enriched uranium in a form that can be turned into weapons much more quickly			0
experts say 550 pounds ( 250 kilograms ) of that 20 per cent - enriched uranium are needed to produce a single warhead			0
@entity5 says it expects @entity83 , the plutonium producing reactor , to be completed and go online sometime next year			0
it would need additional facilities to reprocess the plutonium into weapons - grade material and the @entity125 's nuclear agency monitoring @entity5 's atomic activities says it has seen no evidence of such a project			1
roundtable : @entity26 secretary of state @entity25 with diplomats from @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity47 , @entity1 and and @entity31 during the third day of closed - door nuclear talks in @entity15 on november 9 , 2013 @entity50 said @entity5 is opposed to suspending work on @entity83 while nuclear negotiations go on in attempt to reach a first - stage agreement and then a comprehensive final deal limiting @entity23 's atomic work			1
he said that ' for us ' suspension was absolutely necessary , but it was unclear if that meant @entity1 was alone in seeing the issue as non-negotiable or whether he was speaking for the rest of the negotiating @entity145 is also being asked to blend down ' a great part of this stock at 20 per cent , to five per cent , ' @entity50 said			0
uranium enriched to five per cent is considered reactor fuel grade and upgrading it to weapons - level takes much longer than for 20 per cent enriched uranium			2
he also suggested that the six powers were looking for an @entity5 commitment to cap future enrichment at five percent			0
' we are hoping for a deal , but for the moment there are still issues that have not been resolved , ' @entity50 said			0
debate : ( left to right ) @entity46 foreign secretary @entity163 , @entity5 foreign minister @entity49 , @entity47 's foreign minister @entity164 and @entity44 foreign policy chief @entity43 attend talks at the @entity27 in @entity15 signaling that the talks could end without agreement , @entity46 foreign secretary @entity163 spoke of unresolved issues and told reporters ' there is no fixed time for us to reach a conclusion			1
' any agreement would be a breakthrough after nearly a decade of mostly inconclusive talks , but would only be the start of a long process to reduce @entity5 's potential ability to produce nuclear arms , with no guarantee of ultimate success			1
@entity25 and his @entity184 counterparts arrived in @entity15 on friday with the talks at a critical stage following a full day of negotiations thursday and said some obstacles remained in the way of any agreement offering sanctions reductions for nuclear concessions			2
the presence of @entity31 foreign minister @entity30 and word that @entity131 deputy foreign minister @entity195 also was headed to the talks provided fresh hope for at least an interim deal			1
but @entity62 prime minister @entity199 insisted friday any agreement in the making was a ' bad deal ' that gave @entity5 a pass by offering to lift sanctions for cosmetic concessions that he said left intact @entity23 's nuclear weapons - making ability			1
critical : @entity62 prime minister @entity199 said on november 8 that @entity62 will not be bound to any agreements reached between @entity5 and the six world powers @entity62 is strongly critical of any deal that even slightly lifts sanctions unless @entity5 is totally stripped of technology that can make nuclear @entity217 about @entity199 's criticism , @entity213 spokesman @entity212 said ' any critique of the deal is premature ' because an agreement has not been reached			1
the @entity213 later said president @entity222 called @entity199 to update him on the ongoing talks and said @entity222 affirmed he 's still committed to preventing @entity5 from obtaining a nuclear weapon			2
the @entity213 said @entity222 and @entity199 will stay in close contact			0
@entity25 tempered reports of progress , warning of ' important gaps ' that must be overcome			0
but @entity30 's deputy , @entity229 , was quoted as saying that @entity230 expects them to produce a ' lasting result expected by the international community			0
' the talks primarily focus on the size and output of @entity5 's enrichment program , which can create both reactor fuel and weapons - grade material suitable for a nuclear bomb			1
@entity5 insists it is pursuing only nuclear energy , medical treatments and research , but the @entity26 and its allies fear that @entity5 could turn this material into the fissile core of nuclear warheads .			2
