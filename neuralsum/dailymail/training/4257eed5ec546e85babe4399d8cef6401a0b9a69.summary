by @entity0 @entity2 ’s grip on his job at @entity4 is loosening amid chaos and growing tension behind the scenes at the @entity8			1
@entity2 , 50 , has failed to win in six matches , taking four points from as many home games , but owner @entity12 is understood to be unhappy with the situation and may even follow @entity15 ’s lead and make a second managerial switch if matters do not improve quickly			1
@entity4 are just one point above the relegation zone following an horrific run since november of just one victory in 15 matches			1
frustration : @entity4 manager @entity2 , left , has failed to win in six matches and his methods are being called into question by the squad flashpoint : @entity2 calms down @entity15 defender @entity28 and @entity4 's @entity29 after saturday 's 1 - 1 , which did neither team any favours in their @entity33 survival bid little impact : @entity2 was announced as @entity4 boss on january 16 but has yet to lead the team to a victory concerned : @entity4 's @entity38 , right , and @entity39 , left , fear their lack of pace will be exposed by the tactics of @entity2 they returned early from a break in @entity44 last week and there has already been one clear - the - air meeting between @entity2 , the coaching staff and the players , with former caretaker @entity49 acting as the go - between			1
the first team are unhappy at @entity2 ’s insistence on playing a pressing game , high up the field			1
centre - halves @entity39 and @entity38 are not the quickest and they fear they will be exposed by these tactics			0
the players favour a return to @entity61 ’s methods which led to their highest @entity33 finish , of eighth , two seasons ago			0
their view has been communicated to @entity2 and a new blueprint is reportedly being discussed this week			2
however , there is also disquiet about @entity70 ’s role as director of technical performance			1
the @entity73 - speaker was a prime mover in the appointment of @entity2 , a team - mate of @entity76 in the @entity78 youth team			2
disquiet : @entity79 , who used to work for @entity80 , is having his role as @entity4 's director of technical performance questioned time for a fresh approach : @entity4 sacked @entity84 in december @entity70 was understood to have been among those present when @entity84 was sacked in december , a fact that did not sit comfortably with several members of the backroom team			1
@entity4 ’s sporting and technical director @entity88 is also new to his role but @entity70 appears to have usurped him too , carving out a niche for himself within the club that has not been well received			1
crucially , however , the former @entity80 employee does appear to have the backing of the club ’s owner , peace			2
with all of these issues swirling around the training ground , @entity4 have also taken the decision to restructure their scouting department			0
distant memory : @entity4 striker @entity103 , left , celebrates after scoring the winning penalty against @entity105 on january 1 , 2014 - the last time the @entity4 tasted victory however , the manner of the changes left a nasty taste in the mouths of staff with former midfielder @entity112 , the chief scout , and head of @entity117 recruitment @entity115 both in the line of fire , along with chief scout @entity119			0
@entity4 insisted on tuesday that @entity2 ’s position was under no immediate threat			0
they added that @entity70 had reverted to his original role as head of analysis and was undertaking no duties on the training field with regard to the first team			2
next up : @entity129 and @entity130 will face @entity4 at @entity131 on march 8 the club also confirmed that several positions were being re-designated among their recruitment staff but insisted that the end of @entity137 ’s employment was amicable			0
the @entity138 has given 26 years ’ service to @entity4 as a player and , latterly , as a scout			0
@entity4 have long been championed as a club that punches above their weight but the loss of former technical and sporting director @entity145 to the @entity147 , plus a succession of poor decisions in the transfer market , have contributed to the current position			1
with @entity129 their next opponents at the @entity8 on march 8 , it may well be that @entity2 ’s problems worsen , inflaming an already combustible situation , before they get better			2
a protege of @entity76 who worked for best part of two decades at @entity80			0
brought in as head of analysis by @entity12 to improve data collection on transfer targets			0
however , the loss of @entity145 to the @entity147 left a vacuum			0
with @entity88 new to the technical director role , @entity70 has stepped into the void .			1
