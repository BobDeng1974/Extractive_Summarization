glass panels that were installed on @entity3 ' @entity2 bridge to stop tourists attaching ' lovelocks ' to the railings have been scrawled with graffiti			1
viewed as an apparent protest against city officials preventing the craze from continuing , interestingly it was @entity13 words that were used on the panels			1
the word ' @entity15 ' , or ' beautiful ' in @entity13 was spray painted on the glass			1
amorous couples would attach a lock to the bridge as a sign of their love , and then throw the key into the @entity50			1
writing on their page regarding the graffiti incident , ' no @entity38 ' said : ' new glass panels on the pda are badly tagged today			0
almost as if to mock the city it says , " preciosa " ( lovely / beautiful )			2
looks more " feo " ( ugly ) from where we 're standing			0
or how about , " violento ? " ' is there no respect for @entity3 anymore ? proof that " love locks " breed more vandalism			0

' the locks are strapped to the railings by couples in love who then toss the key into the @entity50 protests from people living in @entity3 urged authorities to halt the tradition of ' lovelocks ' other comments on the @entity39 page liken the iconic bridge to looking more like a @entity80 subway , while others believe the answer is to install @entity83 to catch wrongdoers			1
there are plans to add a third see - through panel and expand the experiment to other bridges as the @entity91 capital cracks down on ‘ visual pollution ’ and attempts to make the blighted bridges safer after a panel of the @entity2 bridge collapsed under the weight of the metal last year			1
@entity2 , a little footbridge over the @entity50 , is one of the city ’s best - known symbols of romance thanks to the ‘ love locks ’ , but it has been said it is at risk of losing its identity as its metal fencing is replaced with glass panels			1
this would satisfy @entity3 officials and residents , who have long bemoaned the tradition of attaching a padlock as a symbol of undying love and tossing the key in the river			2
the locks strapped onto the rails caused part of the bridge to collapse into the @entity50 @entity3 deputy mayor @entity129 told @entity130 : ‘ @entity3 is the capital of love , we are all very proud of that , but there are more beautiful ways of showing that love than by putting padlocks on a bridge			2
’ he said the locks are a costly hazard because they are damaging the city ’s bridges and jeopardising visitors ’ safety due to the added weight			0
in june , part of @entity2 ’ railing collapsed under the weight of the locks , forcing police to close the iconic structure while repairs were made			0
it is estimated there are over 700,000 padlocks attached to the bridge , with each grill weighing 500kg			0
earlier this year , two @entity152 writers who live in @entity3 launched a ‘ @entity154 ’ campaign the metal bridge was originally completed in 1804 but it had to be rebuilt in the 1980s due to damage caused by aerial bombings during the @entity158 .			0
