the @entity1 version one , with its much - hyped unbreakable sapphire screen and hundreds of apps , may not be all that it 's cracked up to be and has been labelled ' a waste of money ' by some of @entity8 's tech experts			1
with the wait almost over , release date for the whiz - bang time - piece is set down for april 24 , the price comparison website finder.com.au suggests , if you have n't already pre-ordered , you might be better off waiting until next year for the second generation @entity15			1
' if you want an @entity17 watch battery that lasts longer than a day , better apps and gps , you might be better off waiting , ' said @entity20 , @entity21 's money expert			1
' while the first generation @entity15 is a very exciting piece of wearable technology , there are clearly many key features missing from the watch			2
if you ’re going to spend between $ 499 and $ 24,000 on the first edition , you might end up being disappointed with its functionality in 11 months time			1
those who pre-ordered are expected to take delivery on friday while @entity17 is promoting the release with ads stating " you ’re going to be amazed by how many things you can do with @entity15 " , a survey of five @entity8 technology experts found a less than enthusiastic response to the current offerings available on the watch			2
they all expect the second version to be a vast improvement , pointing to a long lasting battery life as the number one feature missing from the current @entity15			1
other key features which are absent , include an independent internet connection ( the watch relies on an iphone for data ) , gps and water - proofing was also an issue			1
@entity17 proudly exclaims it to be ' our most personal device yet '			0
' @entity15 is unlike any device we ’ve ever made , ' the company states on its " watch technology " website			2
' the result is an experience that ’s both unique to @entity15 and quintessentially @entity17			2
to make the best use of its size and location on your wrist , @entity15 has all - new interactions and technologies			2
' they let you do familiar things more quickly and conveniently			0
' but ms @entity20 said the first version of the @entity15 might simply be ' a waste of money ' for some consumers , who might be better off waiting until the 2016 version			2
the price comparison for the @entity15 across the @entity100 , @entity8 and @entity101			0
from $ 499 right up to $ 24,000 the @entity17 watch 1 has been in high demand but some tech heads say version two might be worth waiting for she also estimated that @entity108 version two would be released on or around march 18 , 2016			1
that was based on a study of release dates between @entity17 ’s first and second edition ipods , iphones and @entity114			0
two new features the panellists expect to be available on the second version of the @entity15 are the @entity72 facility , and being able to work more independently from the @entity70			0
greater access for app developers is also likely to be available on the second version , so said the experts			0
@entity123 , the owner of @entity125 , said he wanted to see it ' work independently from the @entity70 or wo n't need an @entity70 to set it up '			0
he also hoped there would be better gps capability , along with a ' thinner and faster device with a brighter screen ' @entity131 , editor in @entity132 , @entity133 added : ' better battery life is a given as @entity17 improve its tech efficiency			1
' ' we can also expect more user interface / control options , and greater access to those options for developers			0
' this will be required if app makers are going to be able to make bespoke experiences that maximise the @entity15 , as currently a number of features are gated off , presumably , to minimise quality assurance issues during the device ’s launch			0
' @entity123 ( left ) from @entity125 and @entity131 of @entity133 were among the panel assembled to look at what @entity17 watch 1 has to offer			1
@entity152 wanted it to ' work independently of the @entity70 ' @entity155 ( left ) is from @entity156 wants the @entity17 watch to be water - proof while @entity159 ( right ) representing @entity160 on the panel said the new model should be altered to allow for more apps but the number one technology upgrade that will have the biggest impact on the @entity15 is the @entity70 7 , according to those surveyed , followed by @entity166 – the next mobile operating system – and @entity169 where users can make contact-less transactions through the so - called @entity172 ( @entity172 ) technology			1
' the most exciting part about the @entity15 and wearable technology is the endless potential for how these devices will change our lives , ' said ms @entity20			0
' from turning on our tv to pre-empting a heart attack , to the way we access information and how we pay for things , it has the potential to make our lives more convenient and even more productive			0
' @entity155 , contributing editor at @entity156 has called for a water - proof sport version , with @entity185 and headphone options , while @entity159 , the editor of @entity160 called on @entity17 to ' open @entity187 so there are more apps ' and @entity39 , head of publishing and @entity191 also wants to see it ' work independently to the @entity70 '			1
the @entity15 will initially be available in just nine countries : @entity8 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 but the company says more countries will come on line at a later date .			0

tech heads say the new @entity15 could be ' a waste of money '
low battery life , no gps and lack of water - proofing are among its turn - offs
@entity17 watch 1 will be released on friday but they say you might be better off waiting until next year for version two
@entity17 watches range in price from $ 499 up to the most *expensive* at $ 24,000
