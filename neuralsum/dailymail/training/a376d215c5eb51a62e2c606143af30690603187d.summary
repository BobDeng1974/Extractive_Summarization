a four - year - old has been left with a hole in his nose from a leaking battery which was stuck for a month after medics allegedly mistook it for a @entity5			1
@entity6 from @entity7 eventually had the battery removed after four and a half weeks when a black liquid started oozing from his nose and ears			1
his parents fear he could have breathing problems for the rest of his life because of the hole in his septum â€“ the division between the two nostrils			1
they are considering legal action against @entity21 after medics refused requests for an x-ray and were adamant that the blockage was caused by a @entity5			1
doctors helped the couple give @entity6 a ' mother 's kiss ' where she put her mouth over his , closed his unblocked nostril and gently blew to dislodge the item , but he was not given an x-ray			1
' if they had taken us seriously in the first place , none of this would have happened			0
i asked them for an x-ray but they said no. ' they said it was a @entity5 because when they looked in his nose they saw a scab that was the colour of a @entity5			1
i think it was the acid from the battery scabbing up			0
' a simple x-ray would have shown the battery and they would have removed it immediately			0
' i 'm really angry with the hospital , i feel that they just did n't listen to me and now my son could be facing problems for the rest of his life			1
' the four - year - old eventually had the battery removed after four and a half weeks when a black liquid started oozing from his nose and ears several days after the hospital visit a black liquid started oozing from his ears and nose and his parents took him to their gp			2
they diagnosed ' an infection ' and sent them back to their home with antibiotics			0
but last week @entity6 began having trouble breathing and his worried father took him back to @entity88 at @entity21 where he was seen by four doctors			1
they told them to come back the following day to get the battery removed because there were no doctors available in the @entity96 department			0
it was eventually removed on december 12 when @entity6 was given a general anaesthetic			0
' he 's such a beautiful little boy and now he could potentially have long - term health problems , ' said mr @entity6			2
@entity21 said there was no record of the battery being mentioned when @entity6 was first taken to @entity88 ' i dread to think what might have happened if it had been left any longer			1
' but the hospital claims staff were never told the youngster had a battery in his nose			1
a hospital spokesman said there was no record of the battery being mentioned when @entity6 was first taken to @entity88 on november 11			2
but mr @entity6 insists he told medics that he thought his son had put a battery up his nose on the first visit			1
a hospital spokesman said : ' @entity6 first attended @entity88 with his parents on november 11 with a suspected foreign body up one of his nostrils			2
' @entity123 were able to remove an object , which turned out to be a @entity5 , and checked that the nasal airways were clear			0
' the parents were advised to see their gp if they had any further concerns			0
' we were not made aware by his parents on this occasion that they suspected @entity6 had placed a watch battery up his nose ; had this been mentioned he would have been referred to an @entity96 specialist immediately for further investigation			1
' @entity6 's parents have not approached us regarding the care he received , so we would welcome them to contact us so that we can look into this matter further			2
' in the meantime @entity6 will continue to receive follow - up care with our specialists to monitor his recovery			0
' he added : ' it is important to point out the dangers of children and small batteries			0
' as in the case of young @entity6 , they can cause permanent damage in a relatively small period of time			0
' if a parent suspects their child has placed a battery up their nose they should seek medical advice straight away			0
' the battery would be removed urgently , as was done in the case of @entity6 once we were made aware			2
