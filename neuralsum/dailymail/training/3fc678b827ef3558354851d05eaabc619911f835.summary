by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 13 april 2013 updated : 11:17 est , 13 april 2013 a family has been branded ' morally repugnant ' by a coroner investigating the death of a young mother who sipped ' cannabis fertiliser ' from a @entity7 bottle in their kitchen			1
@entity10 , 23 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , drank the highly - toxic fluid while staying at the home of her boyfriend @entity16 , who had left it on the side in the kitchen			1
her face swelled to twice its normal size and she started vomiting a foul - smelling black substance , an inquest heard			0
inquest : @entity10 , 23 , died after inadvertently drinking ' cannabis fertiliser ' stored in a @entity7 bottle at her boyfriend @entity16 's house @entity16 and his mother @entity28 took ms @entity10 to @entity29 at @entity30 , where they told doctors the bottle contained fish tank neutraliser			1
@entity30 coroner @entity34 even when it emerged that the damage to the young mother 's throat was so severe her oesophagus was corroded to a ' piece of string ' , her weight plummeted to 5st and the bottle was found to contain an extremely high level of alkaline , the @entity35 stuck to their claim			1
she died at @entity30 in june 2011 after six months of agony			0
before her death , ms @entity10 told her mother @entity49 that her boyfriend later confessed the bottle contained cannabis fertiliser			2
the inquest also heard from detectives who found a cannabis farm at the @entity57 ' @entity56 home , for which @entity16 's brother @entity58 was jailed			1
but throughout the hearing , the @entity57 maintained the liquid was fish tank neutraliser which they had found at a house clearance			2
' morally repugnant ' : the evidence from @entity64 ( left ) , his brother @entity16 ( centre ) , and their mother @entity28 ( right ) , was ' at best inconsistent ' the coroner said ' much loved ' : ms @entity10 died as a result of post-operative complications on injuries she sustained after ingestiion of a corrosive substance , the coroner said summing up at the hearing in @entity75 , @entity30 coroner @entity34 said : ' it beggars belief as to what an unbelievably stupid , naive and thoughtless act it was , not only placing such a liquid in a @entity7 bottle but to then crassly leave the bottle where anyone could have taken a drink from it			1
' the evidence from the witnesses @entity28 , @entity16 and @entity58 [ @entity16 ] was at best inconsistent , but in my view was a continued attempt to maintain a fabricated account - an account concocted on the day in order to protect themselves and to try and hide the real reason they 'd had such liquid in their possession			2
' ignorance and arrogance ' : before her death @entity10 told her mother that @entity16 ( pictured ) had confessed the bottle contained cannabis fertiliser ' despite not knowing the extent of the injuries suffered by @entity10 , there was no one who attended at @entity29 that night prepared to give an honest account to the medical staff as to what was known about the liquid			1
' she added : ' the ignorance and arrogance of those attending with @entity10 that night , even when medical staff were doing their best to contact the @entity120 and trying to find out as much information as possible , i find astounding and morally repugnant			0
' she said the liquid was not acquired or left on the side with the intent of trying to harm anyone , but added : ' i have no doubt that the presence of cannabis in the property was a fact known to everyone who stayed there and that the liquid was not something they intended to use for the fish tank			1
' ms @entity10 's family welcomed the coroner 's verdict and said the @entity57 failed to help her			2
her mother @entity49 said : ' we wish to thank the coroner for her thorough and perceptive investigation			0
' the family wishes to echo the words of the coroner in relation to the moral repugnance of individuals who could and should have helped @entity10			0
' she added : ' @entity10 never understood why she did n't receive an apology from @entity16 for leaving the @entity7 bottle out before she died			1
' @entity10 was a much loved and is a much - missed mummy , daughter , sister , sister - in - law , auntie , niece and friend			0
she will continue to be in our everyday thoughts and loving memories			0
' recording a narrative verdict , the coroner said ms @entity10 died as a result of post-operative complications on injuries she sustained after ingestion of a corrosive substance			1
a @entity30 spokesman said : ' @entity10 was admitted to @entity30 following ingestion of a highly - corrosive liquid which had a severely destructive effect upon her major internal organs			0
this injury can be associated with a poor outlook irrespective of management			0
' after a difficult period of recuperation , a finely balanced clinical decision was made in conjunction with @entity10 and her family to undertake surgery to increase the quality of her life			0
' the coroner indicated that the efforts the hospital made were with the best of intentions , but sadly @entity10 suffered post-operative complications leading to her untimely death			2
' the family 's solicitor , @entity192 from @entity13 law firm , @entity191 said : ' it is regrettable that the evidence that has been heard demonstrates that @entity10 's death could have been avoided with proper treatment			0

@entity10 drank substance from @entity7 bottle at boyfriend 's home
detectives later found a cannabis farm at @entity16 's house
coroner said she had ' no doubt ' liquid was not intended for fish tank
leaving fluid around house was ' stupid , naive and thoughtless ' said coroner
coroner said young mother , 23 died of post-operative complications
