@entity0 has revealed his @entity2 's resolution is to make @entity4 the top team in the country by the end of 2015 but acknowledges they will have to improve their away form for that to happen			1
@entity4 travel to @entity12 in a potential @entity14 banana skin on sunday and while the club are on a 10 - match unbeaten run , they have only drawn their last three away games at @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity22 , who saw his side embarrassingly dumped out of the @entity24 4 - 0 at @entity25 , is taking no chances with the trip to @entity28 and has had @entity30 's underdogs watched three times by his scouting team			1
having spent Â£ 150million on star names like @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 in the summer and six months in which to impose his philosophy on the club , @entity0 thinks overtaking @entity51 and @entity52 has to be the target			2
' 2014 was very exciting for me and my players			0
i hope we can continue and for the fans we are number one in the league at the end of this year , ' he proclaimed			2
' you always want that perfect game as a manager and so we need to improve the process and our performances			2
you saw at @entity19 we did n't play the perfect game , we started very badly and lost two points away			0
we have to improve that because otherwise you can not be champions			0
' @entity70 scored against his former club to give @entity19 an early lead at the @entity73 @entity0 's side are nine points adrift of @entity52 and @entity51 after the first game of 2015 @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 were either sold or sent out on loan within a week of the @entity25 debacle and @entity0 promises there will be no similar capitulation this time , even if he reshuffles his pack after four matches in 10 days , and drafts in young defenders @entity89 and @entity90			1
' i can say that in general my players always fight to the end			0
we showed against @entity19 we had the team spirit to fight back and try and get a victory despite a very horrible start , ' he vowed			0
' it is more difficult to prepare for @entity99 than a @entity37 team but we have had them watched and analysed because we are professionals and have to prepare games like professionals , because we know it will not be easy			1
it is a matter of you win or you are dead			0
' @entity22 admits that @entity4 must improve their away form if they are to topple @entity52 and @entity51 @entity108 equalised for the visitors as @entity4 lost further ground on @entity52 how @entity4 and @entity99 compare ahead of @entity14 third round tie at @entity28 on sunday @entity4 have n't won the @entity14 for 11 years and @entity112 is the only survivor of the 2004 team that beat @entity114 in the final , though @entity116 and @entity117 have won the trophy for other clubs			1
twice , @entity4 have needed replays to beat non-league opposition @entity121 and @entity122 and only scraped past another @entity124 side @entity123 1 - 0 in 2011			1
defender @entity125 says the fact the majority of players including @entity129 and himself have not won the @entity14 raises the importance of sunday 's trip to @entity28			1
' we all want to play because it 's a game we want to win and progress in			0
the @entity14 is going to be a big competition for us this @entity137 are not in the @entity138 so there is even more of an expectation to go and put a performance on at @entity99 , ' he said			1
@entity125 has emphasised the importance of the @entity14 ahead of the third round clash ' it wo n't be an easy game down there			1
people might think we will go there and walk all over @entity99 but it wo n't be like that at all			2
' league form does n't matter and what happened against @entity25 is a reminder to us			2
we ca n't let that happen again			0
' ' i did n't play that game , i was at home watching on tv			0
it was very disappointing watching it , we have to make sure there is no repeat			0
' the @entity14 is a massive competition especially for the @entity166 lads in the squad growing up watching the @entity14 draw and the games			0

@entity0 wants to end 2015 with @entity4 top of the league
@entity173 said his side must improve their away form to *achieve* it
@entity4 face @entity177 @entity99 in the @entity14 third round on sunday
@entity22 said it is harder to prepare for @entity99 that for a league game
