by @entity0 published : 02:39 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 08:05 est , 7 august 2013 poor performances by @entity3 's elite swimmers has been blamed on them training in the ' wrong water ' by a top coach			1
@entity6 , head of @entity7 , says perfect conditions at @entity11 's @entity10 pool hampers competitors because they can not replicate their fast times anywhere else in the world			1
@entity3 's swimmers won less than half the expected medals at the @entity17 last year and in the recent @entity18 in @entity19			2
perfect : ideal conditions at @entity11 's @entity10 pool is hampering competitors because they can not replicate their fast times anywhere else in the world top national and international competitions and trials are held at @entity10 which was built for the 1991 @entity26			1
the pool is well known for recording fast times because of its design and consistency of the water			1
the amount of ozone and oxygen in the water helps improve buoyancy and the depth and design cuts down the resistance			2
but @entity6 says the perfect conditions means swimmers ca n't reproduce their fast times			1
@entity3 's head swimming coach @entity6 ( left ) and former @entity46 swimmer @entity45 ( right ) both believe training in @entity11 's @entity10 pool is putting swimmers at a disadvantage he said : ' @entity11 is a problem			1
i do n't want trials there			0
in the future we will question that			0
i would rather use slower pools			0
' it is a fast pool and these guys swim there all the way through their career			2
' former @entity3 international swimmer @entity45 agrees with @entity6			0
he said : ' most people do n't spend their lives in competitive swimming so to hear of a fast pool does sound daft but it 's proved to be very fast			2
' @entity10 seems to have the perfect depth of three metres because it 's all to do with the resistance in the water and also there 's the consistency of the water			1
' because it 's got ozone and oxygen in it , it 's very buoyant so that allows people to swim faster as well			0
' @entity10 is just a fantastic facility			0
it is a victim of its own success because it is so good			0
all our swimmers go there , post really fast times and then ca n't replicate it later in the year			1
i think that 's working against them			0
