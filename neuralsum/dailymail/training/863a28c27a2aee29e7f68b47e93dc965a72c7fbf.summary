in an interview to celebrate his 71st birthday			2
sir @entity10 has spoken about the managers who could replace him , his desire to win back the title from @entity5 and why the return of his ' warrior ' captain @entity7 could make the difference			1
@entity10 was interviewed by @entity12 , when he was also asked about the prospect of @entity16 signing @entity14 from their arch rivals and who he believes is the better player : @entity20 or @entity21			1
@entity10 , who also spoke highly of @entity22 - but did not mention @entity23 once in the interview - said he is still ' hoping to stay for a bit of time ' at @entity27			2
many happy returns : sir @entity10 gave a wide - ranging interview in @entity30 on his 71st birthday ' in terms of football management , i have achieved everything i always wished for			2
it 's been a great journey for me			1
but being manager of @entity16 , you have to kick on			1
you ca n't look back			2
the drive is always on to do better , although it 's not easy in the @entity41			1
it 's a difficult league			1
and @entity44 football is getting stronger and stronger			0
' you have to think of where we lost it last season			0
we were 4 - 2 at @entity50 and did n't win			0
that wo n't happen again			0
our rivals are @entity5 and possibly @entity54			1
we recovered a 12 point disadvantage to catch @entity56 one year and lost 11 point lead to @entity58 , so it 's ( @entity54 ) is possible , but it 's @entity5 who are the biggest danger			1
' asked about managers who will replace him , @entity10 said with a smile : ' there is no - one on the agenda , but somebody will have to replace me ... the fire still burns : @entity16 's manager is as combative as ever after more than 25 years at @entity27 ' i 'm hoping to stay on for a bit of time , anyway			1
' it 's very difficult			1
over the years , names have been bandied about but football is such a precarious industry			1
but you could be talking about one of the potentially exciting young managers in the game , but is he going to be here in two or three years time			0
the sack race is horrendous			0
' sometimes a manager can only survive four games if he does n't win a match			0
it 's impossible to say who is going to be there			1
' @entity10 is then asked about @entity50 's @entity86 and @entity87			1
he says : ' there will always be names bandied about and they are all qualified people			1
nobody knows where they are going to be in two or three years time			0
' top managers will always been in demand			2
heirs to the throne ? @entity87 ( top left ) , @entity98 ( top right ) and @entity86 ( below ) ' @entity98 , @entity87 and @entity86 ... there are a lot of successful managers out there			1
i do n't know what their plans are in two or three years time			0
' @entity10 spoke highly of striker @entity22 , signed from @entity58 last summer			0
' he certainly is magnificent players			2
he brings maturity , he is a proven goalscorer , a proven international and and is at a good age			0
he is helping our young strikers , @entity112 and @entity113			0
he 's been outstanding since he came			2
' he also welcomed the return of @entity7			0
' he has been out for a year and three months , although he has played a few games			0
he 's our captain , a real warrior and our leader			2
' forward talking : @entity10 praised @entity22 ( top ) ... but failed to mention @entity23 ( below ) and he was asked if @entity16 could win the league and @entity122 double , a feat they managed in both 1999 and 2008			1
' it 's hard to marry the two together , ' he replied			2
' we 've done it in the past and there is no reason why we ca n't do it this season too			0
' he was critical of @entity16 's success in @entity134 , however , and believes they should have won more than the two @entity44 cups in his time as manager			1
' i think our club should have done better			0
sometimes we have been unlucky , sometimes we have been disappointing and other times , we have thrown it away			0
' @entity10 also praised his wife @entity144 , to whom he has been married for 47 years			0
' without her backing and support , there is no way i 'd have lasted as long as i have , ' he said			0
no chance ! controversial @entity5 striker @entity14 ( centre ) appears not to be on @entity10 's radar and when asked to decide who is the better player : @entity153 forward @entity20 or @entity154 's @entity21 , he replied : ' they are both the best in the world			1
they have different qualities , but they both have fantastic desire			0
' pride to play , pride to prepare			0
@entity20 practiced for hours , that 's what made him a great player			1
we had the privilege of him for six years and he will go down as one of the best players this club has ever had			2
' finally , the interviewer asks him if he would like to sign @entity14 for @entity16 from @entity5			1
a smiling @entity10 responds : ' i have enough players ! '			2

' @entity98 , @entity87 and @entity86 will always be in demand '
names @entity5 as ' biggest danger ' but says @entity54 are title rivals too
