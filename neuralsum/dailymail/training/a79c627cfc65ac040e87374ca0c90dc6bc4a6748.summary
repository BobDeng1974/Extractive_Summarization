by @entity0 published : 09:23 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 09:31 est , 13 october 2013 one - in - a - million : @entity1 , four , misbehaves because of a condition so rare it is only identified as ' @entity4 ' a naughty boy whose extreme tempers see him kick and scream while flailing around on the floor has been diagnosed with a chromosome defect so rare it does n't have a name			1
doctors have said that @entity1 , four , acts irrationally and violently against his will because of a one - in - a - million chromosome defect that they identify as ' 2p16.3 microdeletion '			1
it means @entity1 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , can fly into a fit of rage at any second and let out a high - pitched scream - an illness is so uncommon it does n't even have an official title			1
his mother @entity22 , 42 , said : ' it 's horrendous			1
@entity1 throws these terrible tempers at the flick of a switch			1
' he hits , headbutts , kicks , screams , lies on the ground and throws anything he can get his hands on			1
' it 's embarrassing when we 're out in public because people just think he 's misbehaved - and i 'm an awful parent who ca n't discipline my child			2
' i just want to scream , " he has a condition , it 's not anyone 's fault			1
" ' @entity1 was diagnosed with the extremely rare disorder which means tiny parts of @entity45 are missing from one of the chromosomes in his genetic make - up in january			1
doctors say it may be linked to either autism or @entity52			1
mrs @entity53 believes @entity1 is one of only a handful of people across the @entity56 to have been diagnosed with the condition			1
his diagnosis came as a complete shock to the mother - of - two , who suffered 12 years of heartache and seven miscarriages before having her first child @entity63 , who is now nine			2
' horrendous ' : mother @entity22 , pictured with @entity1 at their home in @entity16 , @entity17 , says dealing with her son 's behaviour is a daily struggle mrs @entity53 said : ' it 's a relief to know there 's a reason for @entity1 's behaviour , but quite scary as so little is known about it			1
' scientists have only started to detect it in the last couple of years			0
' nobody can tell us anything about how to manage it or what the future holds for @entity1 , because they just do n't know			2
' mrs @entity53 faces a daily challenge managing @entity1 's tantrums			2
she says he is unable to control his temper which flares up because he does n't understand or gets frustrated with everyday situations			0
' he has about three a day - and that 's on a good day ! ' she said			2
@entity87 : in one of his tantrums - which can be sparked by any reason - @entity1 will throw himself on the floor and flail around , kicking and headbutting while screaming at random intervals ' @entity1 can kick off for any reason			2
because he does n't like the colour of the taxi that has turned up to take us somewhere , because we 're going to the supermarket , because he does n't want to walk on anything black or simply because he wakes up in a bad mood			0
' and when he does , i have to watch him like a hawk			0
he knows no boundaries when it comes to danger , so can easily hurt himself or someone else			0
a ' 2p16.3 microdeletion ' is an extremely rare genetic condition that has only been possible to detect in the past few years due to advances in technology			1
sufferers have tiny parts of their dna missing from one of the chromosomes in their genetic make - up			1
the defect commonly causes irrational and sometimes violent behaviour in those that have it			0
although symptoms can vary , @entity1 displayed some obvious indications in his early development that he had the defect			2
the four - year - old was slow to sit up on his own after he was born and took longer than the average child to learn to walk			0
he also did not talk until 12 months ago			0
@entity1 's mother @entity22 also says that @entity1 has misaligned toes - another common symptom			1
' i 've had bruises from where he 's picked up heavy things and thrown them at me , he 's lifted a knife before			0
' he 's recently started to hold his breath until he turns blue which is very frightening			0
' the former auxiliary nurse first noticed something was n't right when @entity1 was born , but doctors dismissed her as a paranoid mother			1
' @entity1 was physically shaky but the hospital said it was just low sugar levels			2
then he was late meeting milestones			0
' it took him eight months to sit up on his own , 18 months to walk and he only started talking when he was three			0
' his toes are also mis - aligned which is one of the symptoms			0
i really had to push doctors for tests , but i 'm glad i did			0
at least now we know it 's an illness			0
at one point i thought either he was just out of control or that i was a terrible mum ! ' a spokesperson for rare chromosome charity unique said : ' a 2p16.3 microdeletion is an extremely rare genetic condition			1
' only in the last few years , due to advances in technology , has it been possible to detect and diagnose this disorder			0

@entity1 , from @entity17 , @entity165 , behaves badly because of a chromosome defect that doctors only identify as ' 2p16.3 microdeletion '
