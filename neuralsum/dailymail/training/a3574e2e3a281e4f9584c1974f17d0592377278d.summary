by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 17:25 est , 5 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:53 est , 5 february 2014 congressional @entity4 continued to insist on wednesday that @entity6 - related job losses would be ' a good thing ' in the long run , as @entity10 chief @entity9 testified in a @entity12 hearing that the @entity6 ' creates a disincentive [ for people ] to work			1
' @entity12 ranking @entity4 rep. @entity15 of @entity17 continued the @entity19 's line from tuesday , saying that the job losses indicate that consumers will have more choices after the @entity6 is fully implemented			1
' that is not a bad thing			0
itâ € ™ s a good thing , ' he said , suggesting that most of the eliminated employment would consist of older workers who would be able to retire early without losing their health benefits			0
@entity31 @entity4 rep. @entity30 said that the nonpartisan @entity10 report did n't indicate that @entity6 would cause employers to cut jobs , but only that many @entity1 would chose not to work			1
' this is n't employers cutting jobs , ' he said			1
' this is workers being empowered			0
' @entity63 is making the poverty trap that much worse , ' he said			2
and the effect on the @entity1 economy , @entity53 claimed , ' will be severe , as if 2.5 million people had stopped working full - time by 2024			1
' that finding is in line with the report the @entity10 issued on tuesday just hours before @entity19 officials began spinning the dour news as a positive development during a hastily assembled conference call for reporters			0
' over the longer run , ' @entity19 press secretary @entity77 told reporters later in the day , , the @entity10 ' finds that because of this law , individuals will be empowered to make choices about their own lives and livelihoods , like retiring on time rather than working into their elderly years or choosing to spend more time with their families			2
' @entity12 chairman @entity53 ( c ) exclaimed that @entity6 's job losses were pushing low - income @entity1 further into a ' poverty trap ' hubris : chairman of the @entity92 @entity91 ( r ) and @entity19 press secretary @entity77 spun the @entity10 's news on tuesday , saying that many @entity1 would simply be choosing to ' spend more time with their families ' instead of working one @entity4 lawmaker , @entity54 democrat @entity96 , claimed during wednesday hearing that being jobless would be a net positive for many people in his state			1
' what that means is instead they might be able to tuck their child in bed at night and read a bedtime story , or go to an activity , which means theyâ € ™ re better off			2
' the @entity10 report does n't specify that the projected job losses stemming from the @entity6 law would be confined to elderly @entity1 who remain in the workforce because they need to keep their health insurance			1
most retirees rely in part on @entity117 , an existing government benefit that is available to all retirees			0
it does , however , suggest that more and more lower - income @entity1 will no longer see the need to remain employed if they can get low - cost or free health coverage without working			0
the report also found that the result of a mass flight from gainful employment will lower @entity1 economic growth , shrink the tax base and raise @entity1 's budget deficits			0
it estimated that the @entity6 will cost taxpayers approximately $ 2 trillion over the course of the coming decade .			0

@entity4 continue to insist that it 's a net positive for millions of @entity1 to be jobless after the @entity6 is fully implemented
the director of the nonpartisan @entity10 *confirmed* wednesday that @entity6 will remove the equivalent of 2.5 million full - time jobs from the economy over ten years
some will choose to ' tuck their child in bed at night ' instead of keeping a job so they can maintain health insurance , claimed one lawmaker
another insisted that ' this is n't employers cutting jobs , this is workers being empowered '
*republicans* shot back that joblessness brought on by the health insurance law would *deepen* a ' poverty trap ' that ensnares poor people
