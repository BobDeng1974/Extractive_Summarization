but when officers in @entity9 carried out a crackdown on sheep rustlers they used the tactic for a very different reason			1
instead of lining up people to catch a criminal , officers lined - up around 40 sheep they had recovered in a bid to reunite them with their shepherds			1
line - up : police in @entity9 held an identity parade as part of a crackdown on sheep rustlers the animals were among 150 ewes recovered following thefts from hill farms across the north @entity30			1
six suspected sheep rustlers have been arrested in connection with the thefts in recent months following the joint operation by @entity9 and @entity35 constabularies			1
the ewes were worth £ 100 to £ 150 each and stolen mainly from @entity9 and @entity37			2
@entity39 @entity38 , from @entity40 , said : ' sheep rustling is a problem year after year and the financial blow for farmers is huge			0
' farmers have been blamed for some of the thefts			0
@entity47 , one of the farmers at the event , said : ' it 's a disgrace to the farmers concerned but , to me , it 's also a disgrace on the farming community			0
' the whole thing is based on trust			0
you turn sheep on to a common and you expect to get them returned because you trust everyone			0
