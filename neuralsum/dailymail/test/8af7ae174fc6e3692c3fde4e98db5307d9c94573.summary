when @entity1 got her business of the ground , she chose to reach out to her competitors and ask them if they were interested in collaborating			1
while most ignored her offer , she did receive one response so nasty , that the thought of it still fires her up			0
' i felt as though i had been punched in the gut , ' ms @entity1 told @entity11			2
after reaching out to competitors only to receive a nasty response , @entity1 now uses her experiences to educate other adults and children on how to deal with online ' flamers ' she teaches the children to follow @entity18 : ignore , communicate and @entity19 in order to deter bullies ' he basically responded saying that i could never know as much as he knows , it was a total power play			1
' ms @entity1 chose to employ the same initiatives she teaches to young children through her @entity29 company , @entity28 , and completely ignore the bully			1
' when dealing with a ' flamer ' or troll , all you want to do is respond to justify yourself , ' she said			0
' but i tell the children to instead follow ' @entity18 ' and ignore , communicate and @entity19			2
' much like a @entity35 , a ' flamer ' sends messages with the intention to hurt the recipient and get a reaction			1
an internet troll often trawls through social media , hunting for victims , while a ' flamer ' ( like in ms @entity1 's case ) waits for the victim to contact them and unleashes a hateful response			1

she advises those experiencing this behaviour to try and not take it personally			0
ms @entity1 tells her students that by ignoring , the bully is being frozen in their tracks with nowhere to go an internet troll often trawls through social media , hunting for victims , while a ' flamer ' waits for the victim to contact them and unleashes a hateful response along with the @entity18 motto , ms @entity1 , in her early 40 's , also advises adults and children who witness others being ' flamed , ' to employ ' @entity69			1

' bullying - related suicides often happen because @entity18 and @entity69 have n't worked that well and the victim has had a difficult time exiting the situation			2
' if , for business purposes , the victim must respond to the ' flamer , ' ms @entity1 has advised that via email is not ideal			1
