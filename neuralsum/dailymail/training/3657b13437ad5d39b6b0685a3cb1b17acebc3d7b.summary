@entity2 's fabled @entity1 fighting force have had their tanks scrapped in the latest defence cuts			2
under a shake - up announced by defence secretary @entity7 for the @entity8 over the next decade , the 7th @entity5 is to be redesignated as an infantry brigade and their heavy armoured vehicles , including @entity12 tanks , will be parked up			1
a military source said : ‘ it is a disgrace			0
this is the most famous tank brigade in the world and they are losing their tanks			2
’ the @entity2 7th @entity5 - nicknamed the @entity1 - is to become an infantry brigade and its challenger 2 tanks - pictured moving through the southern @entity23 city of @entity24 - will be put out of action the @entity1 was formed in 1938 to protect the @entity26 , and went on to fight in some of the war ’s bloodiest battles			1
nicknamed the @entity1 , they were deployed to @entity29 where , under @entity31 , they won the battles of @entity33 to help change the course of the war			0
more recently they served on the battlefields of @entity38			0
the 7th @entity5 will be rebranded the 7th @entity39 – although it will keep the renowned nickname and badge featuring a jerboa , a desert rodent – and it will be dedicated to longer - term engagements such as peacekeeping operations , training foreign troops or helping control civil disturbances			1
@entity49 , chairman of the @entity50 , said : ‘ it is sad because people think of the 7th @entity5 as “ tankies ” because the films show them charging into battle across the desert			1
cutbacks : @entity7 announced the change as part of a shake - up of the @entity8 over the next 10 years ‘ but it was much more than that			1
there were troops from the @entity8 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
but they all had the emblem on their sleeve and that makes you feel proud			0
‘ the brigade has been adaptable through the years and that has enabled it to remain on top			0
’ the success of the @entity1 in @entity29 during the @entity75 led @entity76 to declare : ‘ before @entity33 we never had a victory			0
after @entity33 we never had a defeat			0
’ the @entity1 went on to fight in some of the war ’s bloodiest battles : at @entity82 in @entity83 , in @entity84 and crossing the @entity85 into @entity86			2
they ended the war in the victory parade in @entity89 – at the very heart of the @entity91			0
the 7th @entity5 was detached from the division during early 1942 and fought the @entity93 in @entity94 before returning to battle in @entity83			1
in 1958 the @entity1 was disbanded , though the smaller brigade remained in @entity86 , where it was reformed in 1981			2
the brigade is currently composed of a number of elements , including the 2nd @entity100 and the @entity101			0
it has served in the @entity103 and in peacekeeping operations in @entity105 and @entity106 , and became the first @entity2 brigade into @entity108			0
the revelation of cutbacks to the @entity1 was hidden in the small print of mr @entity7 ’s announcement on fresh roles and bases for the @entity8 over the next decade			1
mr @entity7 also said that 16,000 troops would be brought back from @entity86 by 2020 to save £ 240million a year , ending @entity2 ’s presence on the @entity85 where they have been stationed since 1945			1
an @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ @entity119 , including their @entity1 insignia , will remain in the @entity8 ’s order of battle as an adaptable force brigade			2
‘ as announced , we are reducing our heavy armour by 40 per cent and re-rolling units to face more modern threats			0
that is why the @entity1 will in the future be an infantry brigade equipped with a range of protected mobility vehicles			1

the 7th @entity5 is to be redesignated as an infantry brigade
around 16,000 troops will also be brought back from @entity86 by 2020
