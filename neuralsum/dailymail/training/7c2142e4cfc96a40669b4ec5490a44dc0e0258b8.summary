by @entity0 @entity1 made an unexpected visit to @entity3 on tuesday night for a name - dropping contest with show host @entity5			1
after @entity5 did a bit about her recently released book @entity9 being ' 656 pages of shameless name - dropping , ' the former secretary of state made a ' surprise ' visit to the show to defend her honor			1
as @entity16 seated herself , a shocked @entity5 said , ' @entity1 ! ' to which @entity16 responded : ' now who 's a name - dropper , @entity20 ? ' ' oh ? really ? name - dropper ? that 's not what my good friend @entity23 calls me when we 're hanging out at @entity28 's place , ' @entity5 retorted			1
' i will have you know , @entity43 , i once did an entire show with president @entity16 , ' @entity5 said			1
' i hate to break this to you , @entity20 , but i 've met him , too , ' @entity16 teased			1
' @entity48 , you know everyone			0
what kind of a loser do you have to be to not be included in your book ? ' @entity5 asks , just to find out moments later that he 's not in @entity9			0
through with the name - dropping contest , @entity5 says his other problem with @entity16 's memoir is that there 's no ' real ' @entity9 described in it , ' like which would you rather fight : one horse - sized duck or a hundred duck - sized horses			1
' @entity16 then explains how she 'd resolve a duck - horse war , including meeting with @entity64 , who owns the farm where they both grew up and creating a ' timetable to achieve meaningful horse - duck dialogue			2
' ' and @entity20 , i 'm convinced with patience and a strong commitment from our allies - the pigs and the geese - we 'd have peace , peace , here , peace peace there , here a peace there a peace everywhere a peace ! ' @entity16 eventually tricked @entity5 into telling his audience to buy her book by saying she wo n't ' appear ' on his show without her face being blurred out if he does n't promote her book			1
as @entity16 appeared on set for her surprise drop in , a ' shocked ' @entity5 excitedly said , ' @entity1 ! ' ' now who 's a name - dropper , @entity20 ? ' @entity16 said ' do n't you dare ! ' : ' you were chanting my name four minutes ago , you two - timers , ' @entity5 said as the audience ecstatically clapped for @entity16 and cheered her name @entity5 kicked off the segment by talking about @entity1 's potential presidential candidacy , noting that the former first lady - turned senator - turned secretary of state who is currently self - employed ' is the current frontrunner , which is surprising , since it sounds like she ca n't hold down a job			1
' mocking her star power and a tidbit in the book about @entity16 sitting at a piano with @entity113 , @entity5 said : ' big deal			2
@entity113 sit with everybody at the piano			0
call me when you 're sitting with @entity118 at a didgeridoo , ' he added , as a picture of the @entity122 wind instrument popped up on screen			0
' i just do n't buy any of this			0
there is no way on earth one woman can be in so many places at once , ' @entity5 said as @entity16 joined him on the set			2
as the crowd clapped and chanted , ' @entity1 ! ' the faux news show host told the audience : ' do n't you dare ! you were chanting my name four minutes ago , you two - timers			0
' @entity16 , who has not formally announced her candidacy for president in 2016 , is in fact the most well - traveled secretary of state in @entity143 history			2
the former @entity145 administration official visited 112 countries during her four years in the position , prompting a one journalist to suggest she name her book @entity150 : 112 countries and it â€™s @entity153 , a throwback to both @entity16 's travels and her affinity for wearing outdated scrunchies			0
in the author 's note of @entity9 , @entity16 playfully acknowledged the recommendation			0
' in the end , the title that best captured my experiences on the high wire of international diplomacy and my thoughts and feelings about what it will take to secure @entity143 leadership for the 21st century was @entity172 , ' @entity16 wrote .			0

@entity16 *sparred* off with @entity5 in a name - dropping contest and defended the title of her memoir
' i will have you know , @entity43 , i once did an entire show with president @entity16 , ' @entity5 told her
' i hate to break this to you , @entity20 , but i 've met him , too , ' @entity16 teased
@entity16 explained how she 'd make ' real ' hard *choices* - like how to solve a war between horses and ducks
