by @entity0 a @entity2 couple whose baby girl was seized by police during a holiday in @entity6 have furiously denied being too drunk to look after her			1
@entity7 and @entity9 - @entity8 said they had been handcuffed by police with guns , who told them their heavy - handed response was because of the ‘ @entity17 effect ’			1
the couple ’s 14 - month - old daughter , who we have been asked not to name , was taken into emergency care on sunday after reports they had drunkenly thrown her into a pool and staggered around with her on an eighth - floor hotel balcony			1
ordeal : @entity7 and @entity9 - @entity27 with their 14 - month - old daughter before she was removed miss @entity8 and mr @entity7 , on their first family holiday together since the baby ’s birth , said they were at a loss as to why their daughter was placed in a hospital , and branded reports of their antics as ‘ ludicrous , downright lies ’			1
they also claim mr @entity7 , 29 , was beaten by police and £ 500 – all of their holiday spending money – was stolen during the assault			1
miss @entity8 , 34 , who is on maternity leave from her job as a hospital personal assistant , said : ‘ we are so scared and shaken up			0
‘ the police told us they had acted like they did , that they had been heavy - handed , because of the @entity17 effect			1
they said the case had been very bad for them and that they had to be very careful when it came to the welfare of @entity2 children on holiday			1
’ vanished : @entity6 police said their heavy - handed response was due to the ' @entity17 effect ' the family were staying at the @entity63 in @entity64 – 40 miles from @entity65 where @entity66 vanished in 2007 – as part of a week - long @entity69 package trip			1
their story first emerged in the @entity6 press , which quoted unnamed hotel guests as saying that while sat by the pool , they had seen @entity76 on the balcony behaving dangerously			1
the reports also said the daughter had bruised legs after her mother dropped her and that a drunken mr @entity7 hurled her into the pool in front of horrified holidaymakers			1
but both parents vehemently deny any of this took place – especially as their room , which they showed to the @entity89 , does not overlook the hotel pool but a car park , from where @entity76 could not possibly have been seen			1
looking drained , she said : ‘ you can see from my daughter ’s legs there are no bruises			1
i did not drop her , i have never dropped her and i was not drunk			0
‘ she is my first and only baby and i adore her			0
i am such a protective mother			0
i just ca n’t believe the lies i am hearing			0

miss @entity8 said : ‘ i had three cocktails and was merry , not drunk by any stretch			0
’ at 8pm , after they returned to the hotel , police knocked on the door			2
‘ they said they wanted to check on the baby , ’ said miss @entity8			0
‘ my daughter was crying because she is teething so i gave her some @entity116 ( a brand of paracetamol for children )			2
‘ the police saw the bottle and said that it was an “ illegal drug in @entity6 ” and they were taking her to hospital for tests to see if we had sedated her			2
they were very brusque and had guns			0
’ the family were staying at the @entity63 in @entity64 - 40 miles from @entity65 where @entity66 vanished miss @entity8 was allowed to go to the hospital too			2
but when medics ‘ started sticking needles ’ in her baby for drug tests , she protested and was handcuffed			2
soon afterwards , mr @entity7 arrived at the hospital but was refused entry			1
he claimed : ‘ i did get angry and started to shout and swear as i wanted to see my baby			0
a group of about seven policemen started hitting me , they put me in handcuffs and threw me on the floor in the back of a police car			2

they checked my wallet for @entity150 and when i got home i saw that all of our spending money had gone			0
