we know @entity1 can hide frown lines , prevent migraines and even ease excessive perspiration			2
now women are requesting off - label use of the injectable to help prolong their blow - outs			0
according to @entity10 , the procedure is becoming popular with some women ' so they can attend @entity12 without getting their hair sweaty			1
' top @entity15 dermatologist dr @entity14 says the improved hair quality is a benefit of @entity1 's effect on the sweat glands			1
an extreme solution to frizz - free hair ? @entity1 is now being injected into the scalp in order that patients can have longer - lasting blow - dries ' it works exactly like injections for hyperhidrosis , ' she tells @entity29			2
' [ @entity1 ] inhibits the eccrine glands specifically			2
' the result of reduced scalp perspiration is that a patient may experience less frizz and not have to wash their hair as frequently			0
dr @entity14 says that while the cost of the procedure can be ' prohibitive ' , she would recommend it if asked			1
' it has few side effects if given in a safe dilution and dose , ' she explains			0
' it should be discriminately placed along the hairline and frontal area where frizz is most prominent			0
' @entity10 reports that one would need over 100 units of @entity1 to treat an entire scalp and the effects would last three months			0
but dr @entity14 says she would not advise the use of @entity1 on the whole head as it ' would not be practical from a cost or safety profile			1
' while she has never injected an entire scalp , dermatologist dr @entity56 tells @entity10 that ' several women whose foreheads i have injected happily report decreased sweating at the hairline and temples			1
' but dermatologist dr @entity64 argues that the procedure is painful , expensive and not effective enough to be worth the patient 's while			1
he explains to @entity10 that only injecting the hairline will not prevent sweat on other areas of the scalp , so the rest of one 's hair will likely still frizz or fall limp from sweat after a workout			2
what 's more , the thicker skin on the scalp means that @entity1 injections in that area will hurt more than those on the face , where the skin is thinner			0
' the cost / benefit ratio is n't going to make sense , considering the lack of ability to stop enough sweating to make a real difference , ' he said .			0
