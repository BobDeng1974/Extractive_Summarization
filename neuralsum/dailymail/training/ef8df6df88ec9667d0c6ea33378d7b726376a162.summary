squatters refusing to leave a @entity2 apartment at the centre of an @entity5 ' horror story ' have complained they are the ones being harassed			1
hiding his face with a hoodie and scarf , a man who claimed to be the brother of squatter @entity13 answered the door of the home in a gated community in @entity2			1
videogame programmer @entity13 is currently locked in a legal battle with @entity5 host @entity19 , 39 , who initially agreed to rent him her property for 44 days from may 25 to july 8			1
but now he refuses to leave			2
hooded : a man claiming to be the brother of @entity5 renter @entity13 answers the door to @entity27 process server @entity25 - who left without handing over the eviction notice ' horror story ' : @entity13 is locked in the legal battle that could last for months and cost $ 5,000 because under @entity33 law he can not just be kicked out for not paying his rent or overstaying his welcome what @entity19 did n't realise is that under @entity33 law once someone has rented a property for more than 30 days they are treated as a tenant on a month - by - month lease			1
to get him out she now has to go through a legal process that could take between three and six months and cost between $ 3,000 and $ 5,000			1
in that time @entity13 and his brother can continue to live rent - free			1
and the brothers do n't seem to be giving up easily			0
@entity27 process server @entity25 arrived yesterday to serve @entity13 with an eviction notice			1
@entity25 could n't serve the papers because he has to hand them to @entity13 personally but the man answering the door claimed to be his brother			1
instead , the man complained to @entity25 : ' i ca n’t [ take the scarf off ] because these guys [ the press ] have been harassing me all day			0
i ca n’t even get to my secure mailbox			0
' @entity25 was n't convinced			0
' if he ’s covering his face , that 's probably him , ’ he said as he walked away			0
after paying his initial 30 days rent , @entity13 has not made any further payments , and ignored repeated requests to vacate the property by both @entity5 and @entity19			1
shortly after moving into the home , located on the @entity68 side of the upmarket desert community , @entity13 told @entity19 his brother had fallen ill from drinking the tap water and was now suffering a stomach ulcer			1
@entity19 , who lives in @entity73 and works as a therapist for blind people , was also met with an angry response when she threatened to cut off the utilities			2
@entity13 texted her : ' @entity19 , this is @entity13			2
i have consulted my attorney			0
as i said multiple times i am legally occupying the domicile			0
my nature of work from home is dependent on electricity , and my income while working averages $ 1,000 to $ 7,000 per day , involving over 2000 customers in the @entity90 alone			0
if the electricity gets cut @entity92 i will be @entity93			0
' i am pressing charges for blackmail and damages caused by your negligence and misconduct , including $ 3,800 pid espresso machine as well as medical bills for my brother ’s hospital visit after he got sick here drinking unfiltered tap water ( ulcer )			0
' not only what you do is illegal , it is also discriminatory in nature and had ( sic ) cause me and my brother a lot of stress and suffering			0
' @entity19 told the @entity115 that the episode has been a ' horror story '			1
she bought the one - bedroom condo 18 months ago and she charged around $ 450 a week to renters			2
squatter : @entity13 ( seen here promoting his videogame ) first complained to @entity19 that his brother had fallen ill from the water			1
then when she threatened to turn off the utilities he said he had contacted a lawyer when it became clear that @entity13 was turning into a nightmare tenant @entity19 complained to @entity5 , but was angry at the response from the company			1
' they were almost absent , ' she said			0
' there was no phone number or direct contact e-mail			0
i got e-mail responses only every 24 to 48 hours			0
' @entity5 eventually paid her the two weeks ' missing rent and offered to pay for @entity13 , who had a ' verified @entity141 ' with @entity5 saying he is from @entity142 , @entity143 , to stay at a hotel for 30 days			1
but he never answered emails and his phone was disconnected			0
@entity5 has since apologised and spokesman @entity147 said : ' officials from our team have contacted this host and she has been paid the full cost of the reservation and we 're working with her to provide additional legal support as we move forward			1
' we 're also reviewing our procedures and making changes to our platform to give hosts more information about long - term reservations			0
' @entity13 was identified by @entity162 as a videogame programmer who created a computer game called @entity166			2
@entity13 used kickstarter to raise $ 40,000 to fund the game but after eight months he has delivered nothing beyond a demo			2
@entity171 said @entity13 has claimed that the game will be released , but has said he has made some bad business decisions			2
the case echoes that of ' nightmare nanny ' @entity177 , who moved in to work for @entity178 and her family in @entity180 , @entity33 , earlier this year but quickly gave up all duties , and refused to leave despite being fired			2
apology : @entity5 came under fire from the condo 's owner @entity19 for not helping her quickly enough at first			1
the firm has now apologised , paid her rent she was due and offered to help with the legal fees involved mrs @entity178 , 31 , and her husband , @entity190 , hired @entity177 on march 4 using @entity191 to help with their three children , ages 11 , four and one , but @entity177 quickly stopped doing any work , claiming she had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease			1
she also reportedly threatened to sue the family for wrongful dismissal and abuse of the elderly			0
although the police were contacted they said there was nothing they could do , as it was a civil matter			0
after negotiations with the family she was thought to have left at the beginning of july			0
attorney @entity210 told @entity211 that the landlord tenant law in @entity33 is very specific in terms of eviction processes			1
' if the guy 's a deadbeat , what does he care ? he paid one month and he gets three months , ' @entity210 added .			2

@entity19 , 39 , locked in ' horror story ' after squatter who rented her @entity2 home is refusing to leave
under @entity33 law @entity13 is treated as a month - to - month tenant so a legal process to evict him will take up to six months and cost thousands of *dollars*
a man claiming to be his brother yesterday said he was ' harassed ' as a process server came to hand @entity13 eviction notice
@entity5 apologised for not dealing with the nightmare quick enough , have offered to pay @entity19 's legal fees and refunded her the *unpaid* rent
