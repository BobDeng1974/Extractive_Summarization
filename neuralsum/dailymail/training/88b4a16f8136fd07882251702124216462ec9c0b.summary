by @entity1 reporter published : 02:06 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 02:06 est , 9 march 2013 a proposal in the @entity3 that would tax electronic cigarettes at the same rate as regular cigarettes has put the state at the forefront of a national movement to regulate the increasingly popular devices			1
more than 35 proposals calling for some type of regulation of electronic cigarettes have been introduced this year in legislatures across the country , but @entity16 seems to be the only state currently proposing that they be taxed like regular tobacco , said @entity20 , a tobacco policy analyst with the @entity22			1
@entity20 is unaware of any state with a law like this on the books			2
popular : @entity27 , managing director of the @entity28 , smokes an electronic cigarette as he shows off his product often called ' e-cigarettes , ' the battery - powered devices heat a liquid nicotine solution and create vapor that users inhale			1
their popularity has spiked in recent years			1
first marketed overseas in 2002 , e-cigarettes first became widely available in @entity39 in 2006			1
there are several million users worldwide today , up from a few thousand in 2006			1
analysts estimate sales could double to $ 1 billion in 2013			1
some companies have even started running tv commercials , including an ad during this year 's @entity47 that showed a man using an electronic cigarette made by an @entity51 - based company			1
many states have been waiting for the @entity53 to come out with regulation before passing their own laws , but states seem to be growing impatient , @entity20 said			2
' the more popular they become , a more prominent public policy issue they become , ' @entity20 said			2
' without federal regulation , it 's left up to the states			0
' the @entity53 's current stance is that health impact of electronic cigarettes is unknown because it has not been properly studied			0
there is speculation that the agency will take over regulatory authority of the devices this year , dealing with them in a similar way as they do with regular cigarettes and other tobacco products			1
the @entity16 measure 's sponsor , @entity74 rep. @entity74 , says e-cigarettes should not be considered healthy			1
' they 're trying to sell them as nicotine replacement therapy			0
it is not , ' @entity74 said this week			0
' it is not an @entity53 - approved nicotine replacement therapy			0
there 's medications , there 's patches , there 's things for that			0
this is not one of them			0
' taxed : on cigarettes , the @entity16 state tax is generally a flat $ 1.70 for a pack of 20 @entity74 considers electronic cigarettes similar to other tobacco products and says they should be taxed as such			1
his measure extends to dissolvable tobacco , which is pressed into shapes like tablets that slowly melt in a user 's mouth			1
' this is terrible stuff			0
they 're peddling stuff that they know absolutely will kill people , ' @entity74 said			0
' this is an industry who kills their clientele			0
' @entity16 law already prohibits anyone younger than 19 from possessing the products or anyone from selling the products to someone younger than 19 , but because of a loophole , county and city agencies are not able to impose fines or penalties on those selling e-cigarettes or dissolvable tobacco products to anyone underage			1
proposal : senator @entity74 considers electronic cigarettes similar to other tobacco products and says they should be taxed as such the electronic cigarettes would be taxed at 86 percent , @entity74 said			1
that 's the same as @entity16 's rate on cigars , roll - your - own tobacco or pipe tobacco			1
on cigarettes , the state tax is generally a flat $ 1.70 for a pack of 20 smokes			2
it usually costs about $ 50 to buy the equipment to get started using electronic cigarettes , said @entity141 , who has used the devices to quit smoking			1
after that , the main cost is buying the ' e-juice , ' which is a nicotine - laced liquid that becomes the vapor when heated			0
a 30 - milliliter dose usually costs $ 15 - $ 20 and lasts about two weeks , @entity141 said			2
so , under @entity74 's proposal , a $ 20 batch of liquid nicotine would cost about $ 37.20			1
currently , people only pay regular sales tax on electronic cigarette items			2
a legislative analysis shows the state could see an additional $ 1.6 million a year if the e-cigarette tax becomes law			1
it 's unclear how far the measure will get in this year 's legislative session , which comes to a close thursday			2
an amended version of the bill passed through a @entity165 committee wednesday afternoon			0
it is now awaiting debate by the @entity165			0
if approved , it moves to the @entity169 for consideration			0
electronic cigarettes are touted as a way to break an addiction to traditional cigarettes			0
@entity141 , 38 , of @entity175 , @entity16 , is among the believers			1
reduced costs : it usually costs about $ 50 to buy the equipment to get started using electronic cigarettes , said @entity141 , who has used the devices to quit smoking he credits the devices with helping him quit smoking after 20 years			1
he had tried quitting a dozen different times using nicotine patches , gum and lozenges			0
' quitting smoking has never been easier			0
i quit almost overnight , ' said @entity141			0
' cigarettes taste horrible to me now			0
and , i 'm doing much less harm to my body by doing this			0
' since he started using electronic cigarettes in late 2011 , @entity141 has gradually been cutting back on the amount of liquid nicotine in the devices			2
he 's hoping to be able to stop using them all together within a year			2
' vilifying these products is the wrong approach , ' @entity141 said			2
' if the state and this country is serious about helping us make healthy choices then this is something that should be encouraged			0

popularity of ' e-cigarettes ' booming , from a few thousand users in 2006 to a predicted $ *1billion* in sales this year
@entity16 proposal claims devices are similar to other tobacco products and therefore should be taxed as such
