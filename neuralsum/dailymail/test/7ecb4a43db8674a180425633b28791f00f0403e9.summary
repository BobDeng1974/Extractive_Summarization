@entity0 are set to hold off on expanding the capacity of their 12,000 - seater @entity2 - as a tactic to help them next season			1
the away contingent are currently crammed into a corner of the ground between the @entity10 and the @entity11			0
manager @entity12 prefers the away fans not to be behind one of the goals to give his players a psychological advantage when they are playing in front of a home crowd			1
@entity0 will not look to increase the capacity of their 12,000 - seater @entity2 @entity20 rules state clubs must give the away fans 10 per cent of their overall allocation @entity0 officials are considering doubling the @entity25 from its current 2,500 seats to 5,000 , taking the whole capacity to just less than 15,000			1
however , @entity20 regulations state that clubs must provide at least 10 per cent of their overall allocation of tickets for away supporters			0
this would mean that , should @entity0 press ahead with the expansion , away fans might then have to be positioned behind one of the goals - against @entity12 ’s wishes			1
last year , the possibility of increasing the stadium to 18,000 by filling in all four corners was discussed , but the logistics of that make it unlikely			0
just to expand the @entity25 would cost the club £ 1.8million and , over the course of a season , they would only accrue £ 900,000 in ticket sales			2
any construction would , therefore , be for the benefit of fans as opposed to any financial advantage			0
manager @entity12 is reluctant to change the position of the away fans to behind the goal with a capacity of 12,000 @entity0 look set to have the smallest ground in the @entity20 the club will have to install undersoil heating during the summer to adhere to @entity20 rules , something which was not a requirement in the @entity65			1
the press box , which at present separates home and away fans in the @entity68 , will also move to the opposite side of the pitch to be closer to the dugouts			0
stewards or netting would be put between supporters from either side to keep them apart during matches			0
@entity0 only had the @entity25 built when they won promotion to the @entity65 in 2013 , such has been their rapid rise up the football pyramid .			2

manager @entity12 does not like having away fans behind the goal
the club will install undersoil heating in time for next season
@entity0 all but *secured* promotion with a 3 - 0 win over @entity90
