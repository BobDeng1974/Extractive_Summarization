by @entity0 last updated at 1:26 pm on 29th february 2012 a 340 - ton boulder - due to go on display as a modern art exhibit - has begun a painstaking 105 mile journey from the spot it was found to the museum where it will be housed			1
the enormous chunk of granite , will take 11 nights to travel between a quarry in @entity12 , @entity13 , and the @entity14 on @entity16 's @entity15			1
@entity20 onto a giant transporter 200 feet long and three lanes wide , the rock will crawl along at around eight miles an hour making its way through four counties and 22 cities			1
when he came across the huge specimen in 2007 he said simply : ' that 's the one '			0
the piece entitled @entity54 will be placed over a 456 - foot - long trench on the @entity14 's north side			1
visitors will be able to walk underneath it where it will appear to be floating in the air above them			0
@entity62 , which specializes in moving extremely large or sensitive objects , like nuclear generators and missiles , have taken charge of the tricky operation which will end on march 10			2
@entity68 : the notoriously reclusive artist @entity28 had reportedly been looking for the perfect specimen for over 40 years logistics : to make way for the enormous vehicle , traffic signals will have to be disassembled and power lines cut before everything is reassembled in time for the morning rush hour workers lift power lines to make way for the custom built trailer which is three lanes wide and longer than a football field due to the scale of the operation it can only be moved during the night and early hours and the most direct route via the @entity88 and @entity89 freeways is out of the question as the bridges can not bear the weight			1
to clear the way , traffic signals will have to be disassembled and power lines cut before everything is reassembled in time for the morning rush hour			0
dozens of people were on hand to bid farewell to the rock and the quarry even hosted a barbecue on tuesday night for museum staff and others involved with the move			2
steady : a crane lowers a supporting brace into the frame			0
the total cost of the operation is estimated to be somewhere between $ 5million and $ 10million operation : an engineering team , which normally specialises in transporting large objects like nuclear generators or missiles , constructs a frame around the boulder which will become part of the trailer the trailer , equipped with 44 axles , built to hold at least a million pounds and powered by 650 - horsepower engines in the front and back , will be accompanied by as many as 60 people who will clear a path for the rock and make sure it does n't smash into anything going around turns			1
attraction : the rock will be placed on the north side of the @entity14 it will travel no faster than 5 to 8 miles per hour and only late at night and in the early morning			1
the trip is expected to take 11 days , with the rock scheduled to roll up to the museum 's back door sometime before dawn on march 10			1
the curious can follow the rock 's progress on @entity141 or through the museum 's website and blog			2
museum spokesman @entity145 said : ' we 're going to keep everybody updated as to where it 's parked each day '			0
many were wary , especially given that officials say it is likely the largest rock to be moved from @entity154 to point b since the days when the ancient @entity156 were building the pyramids			2
the museum finally worked out a route that went around freeway overpasses , stayed away from bridges and avoided narrow streets to enough of a degree that everybody was satisfied			0
the total project is costing $ 5 million to $ 10 million			1
museum director @entity166 noted recently : ' it 's funny , the @entity156 did n't have rubber wheels and diesel trucks to move things			0
but they also did n't have 22 cities through which they had to move their stones			0
' and in @entity13 , ' he added , " everybody has a say			0
the @entity178 company @entity177 is covering much of the cost of the trip			2
private donors also helped fund the artwork .			0
