he was formerly known as @entity28 , but his family have asked media outlets to refer to him by his @entity39 name , @entity44			1
but it also implores his parents to ' take comfort ' in the fact that it was his commitment to helping other people that led to him being captured			1
in the message he says : ' i am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing , wondering , hoping , and wondering if i should even hope at all			2
growing up : @entity44 , formerly @entity28 , @entity7 is pictured above with his father on a fishing holiday as a child : @entity44 is pictured above with his mother in front of a waterfall as a boy ' i am very sad that all this has happened and for what all of you back home are going through			1

' ' i wish this paper would go on forever and never run out and i could just keep talking to you			0

in his letter he wrote : ' in terms of my faith , i pray everyday and i am not angry about my situation in that sense			2
i am in a dogmatically complicated situation here , but i am at peace with my belief			0

we continue to pressure the government to stop its actions and continue to call on his captors to have mercy and release him			0

the beheading of @entity145 yesterday followed the murders of three other hostages in similar circumstance : @entity2 journalists @entity170 and @entity172 and @entity146 aid worker @entity173			2
@entity2 officials have confirmed that mr @entity7 is being held by @entity176 militants , but have declined to give any more details of his capture			2
after the video surfaced , president @entity156 strongly condemned the killing and urged that @entity2 forces and its allies will bring his killers to justice			2
' mr @entity145 worked to help improve the lives of the @entity11 people and his death is a great loss for them , for his family and the people of the @entity146 , ' he said in a statement			1

' the president added that the @entity2 and other nations will continue to take action to ' degrade and ultimately destroy ' the @entity205			0
this is the letter that @entity14 and @entity15 received from their son in captivity			1
before it was released the text was edited for length and sensitive information redacted : ' the first thing i want to say is thank you			2
both to you and mom for everything you have both done for me as parents ; for everything you have taught me , shown me , and experienced with me			2
' i can not imagine the strength and commitment it has taken to raise a son like me but your love and patience are things i am so deeply grateful for			0
' i am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing , wondering , hoping , and wondering if i should even hope at all			0
