at six - and - a - half years old , @entity1 ’s daughter is the oldest child still breastfeeding in the @entity2 - and her mother has no plans to stop any time soon			1
instead ms @entity1 will let @entity5 decide when it ’s time to quit			1
currently , the @entity8 pupil asks for a feed when she is tired , ill or simply wants some bonding time with her mum			2
the little girl sometimes asks to be fed as much as twice a day or as little as once a week			1
healthy : @entity1 , 44 , says extended breastfeeding has left her daughter @entity5 happier and healthier sometimes she feeds on her own , and other times she latches on alongside 18 - month - old brother @entity18			1
and ms @entity1 , 44 , insists she will continue until @entity5 decides it is time to stop			1
' i ’ll feed @entity5 as long as she asks , ' she says			1
' i do n’t know how long that will be			2
it will be the same with @entity18			2
i do n’t think there ’s anything weird about it			0
i feed both children on demand - whenever they want it			1
' @entity5 is a head taller than most of her classmates and is rarely ill. her mother puts this down to her ' mama ’s milk ' , which she also says is responsible for the confidence of her clever daughter - a talented violinist , singer and dancer who is top of the class in most subjects			1
ms @entity1 , a phd student of ancient science , says : ' i have two healthy , bright , confident children who i truly believe have benefitted from breast milk , and continue to do so			1
' she also has the backing of partner @entity46 , 47 , a technical director at a university drama department			0
' breastfeeding has n’t impacted my sex life in any way , ' she adds			2
' it has n’t ruined my breasts			0
' in fact she credits it with helping her keep her figure and her health , saying : ' i ’m protected from various cancers and can eat what i want without gaining weight			0
' but she insists that the benefits it gives to her children are the driving force			0
' mothers who feed for longer are often accused of being selfish , ' she says			0
' there are things i get out of it - like calm , happy children			2
but i can say with certainty i ’ve done this entirely for the benefit of my kids			0
' when @entity5 finishes i ’ll be sad but it ’s a natural progression			1
her milk teeth are going and i get the impression she wo n’t be feeding for much longer			0
but she can take her time			0
' benefits : @entity1 has also benefitted and says continued breastfeeding means she stays slim with ease ms @entity1 admits her choice has raised eyebrows , saying : ' i used to get the odd comment from relatives who ’d say " here we go with the milk thing again "			1
' but i think because people know i ’m confident in my decision they let me get on with it			0
' however , @entity5 no longer feeds from her mother in public			1
' i will sometimes tell @entity5 no , ' says ms @entity1			1
' she has n’t asked to be fed publicly since she was about four or five			2
luckily , i have n’t had many negative responses			0
' despite her insistence on the benefits of breastfeeding long term , ms @entity1 says she never planned to continue breastfeeding for so long			1
when @entity5 was a newborn , she expected to feed her for six months to a year at the most - but when the time came she began to change her mind			1
' i heard women talking about tricking their babies to stop breastfeeding , or simply taking it away , ' she says			1
' @entity5 seemed so tiny and she really needed her milk			1
' once she started to look into the subject , she discovered baby - led weaning			2
' it became clear that the norms in this country are n’t necessarily correct or what is best for children , ' she says			0
' @entity115 recommends breastfeeding up to two years and beyond			2
i decided to let nature play its course			0
' ms @entity1 , from @entity118			1
@entity119 , found help and advice through groups such as breastfeeding support organisation @entity123			2
' having a strong support network is really important , ' she says			0
' i try to help parents with the information i have as it saves lives , empowers women and makes children happy			0
weaning : @entity1 says her children will decide when to stop breastfeeding themselves ' when mums are told to cover up while breastfeeding in @entity135 ’s or ignorant politicians like @entity137 leader @entity136 tell nursing mums to " sit in the corner " , it only does harm			1
' what we need is more openness and more truth so mums can make informed decisions			0
' she adds : ' there are so many myths about breastfeeding it ’s unreal			2
people argue that after a certain age breast milk has no nutritional benefits but that ’s nonsense - there is not a single food source that suddenly stops being nutritious			2
' my children have hardly been ill. @entity18 came down with something the other day and because i nursed him through it he was better in 24 hours			0
' i ’ve had similar with @entity5			1
if they ’re upset it calms them			0
' she also says that accusations of fostering an unhealthily dependent relationship between her and her children are untrue			0
' people think by feeding @entity5 this long i will stunt her confidence			1
but she is extremely independent - if anything , she can be too bolshy sometimes , ' she says			2
' her teachers say she is mature for her age			0
she ’s been away from me at her nan ’s for a week and was fine			0
' she admits : ' if you ’d asked me five years ago i never would have thought i ’d still be breastfeeding @entity5			1
however , it turned out to be one of the best things i could have done for my family			0
' and for little @entity5 and @entity18 , nothing could seem more natural			1
' @entity5 understands not everyone breastfeeds as long as her , but she ’s proud of it			1
' she ’ll pretend to breastfeed her dolls			0
the other day at playgroup @entity18 picked up a toy bottle and did n’t have a clue what it was			0
i was proud of that			0
