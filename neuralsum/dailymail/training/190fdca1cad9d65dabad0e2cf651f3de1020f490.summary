@entity0 could be stuck with @entity1 for life after judges put the fanatic ’s human rights ahead of protecting the public – even though they accepted he was ‘ very dangerous ’			1
the judges said that while @entity11 ’s deportation was ‘ long overdue ’ , his risk to the public was not ‘ a relevant consideration ’ under human rights laws			1
the verdict drew a furious response from the @entity16 and sparked new demands for the government to ignore the courts and simply throw him out of the country			0
the @entity0 government launched the appeal after the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) ruled that @entity1 should not be deported to @entity25 where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in 1999 the @entity28 yesterday upheld an earlier verdict that sending the hate preacher to face a terror trial in @entity25 would not be fair			1
home secretary @entity32 will now lodge a last - ditch appeal to the @entity34			1
if that fails , it would raise the prospect of @entity11 – variously described as a ‘ truly dangerous individual ’ and @entity40 ’s right - hand man in @entity41 – never being deported			1
he could apply to be freed within days			2
@entity11 – described by mrs may ’s legal team as ‘ truly dangerous ’ – has now defied the wishes of six @entity46 and @entity48 home secretaries over eight years			1
yesterday justice secretary @entity49 said : ‘ @entity46 and the @entity55 ’ refusal to contemplate big changes to human rights law is inexplicable given problems like this			0
i am bitterly unhappy that we have to wait until the next general election to sort this out			0
’ but there was also stinging criticism of the @entity63 ’s failure to boot @entity11 out			1
shadow home secretary @entity64 said mrs may ’s strategy of pursuing the case through the @entity0 courts rather than in @entity41 had backfired disastrously , adding : ‘ this is an extremely serious and disappointing judgment			1
’ @entity11 was once described as @entity40 ¿ s right - hand man in @entity41 and even the judges in the @entity71 admit he is regarded as a ' very dangerous ' man ministers have been trying for a decade to send @entity11 to @entity25 , where he is accused of plotting a terrorist atrocity to coincide with the millennium			1
his removal was originally approved by the @entity0 courts , only to be halted by the @entity80 last year			1
judges in @entity82 said he would not get a fair trial because some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture			0
controversially , mrs may opted not to appeal against this verdict			2
home secretary @entity32 has branded qatada a ' dangerous man ' but repeatedly failed in her promise to put him on a plane instead , she and her ministers secured personal promises from the @entity25 authorities there would be no use of torture evidence , and began the deportation process again in the @entity0 legal system			1
but last november , the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) said it was not satisfied with the assurances , and halted @entity11 ’s removal			1
the court said it must reflect the @entity82 ruling			0
that decision was yesterday unanimously upheld by @entity106 , the @entity107 , and two other @entity28 judges			0
@entity106 , sitting with @entity109 and @entity110 , said @entity11 was ‘ considered to be a dangerous and controversial person ’			1
he added : ‘ it is entirely understandable that there is a general feeling that his deportation to @entity25 to face trial is long overdue			1
but the principles that we have to apply do not distinguish between extremely dangerous persons and others who may not constitute any danger in the @entity0 and whom the @entity123 wishes to deport to face trial in another country			1
‘ the fact that ( @entity11 ) is considered to be a dangerous terrorist is not relevant to the issues that are raised on this appeal			1
’ @entity48 mps have repeatedly urged mrs may to ignore the courts and throw @entity11 out			1
but that would mean taking the unprecedented step of defying judges in both @entity41 and @entity0			2
last night , there was growing unrest among @entity16 at the failure to get rid of the cleric			0
@entity141 @entity140 said : ‘ the government made a strategic mistake in the way it argued this case			0
there is nothing in the @entity148 or @entity0 law that says we have to guarantee fair trials at the other end when we deport foreign criminals or terrorists			2
‘ if we had made clear that we rejected @entity82 ’s ruling – and meddling – on principle at the outset , the @entity155 could have deported @entity11 without the @entity0 courts stopping them			1
’ @entity162 , chairman of the home affairs select committee , said the ' farcical situation ' must not be repeated and shadow home secretary @entity64 said the government 's strategy for dealing with @entity11 had been ' ripped apart ' @entity11 is in @entity169 high - security jail for allegedly breaching his immigration bail conditions			1
police are investigating whether he posted extremist propaganda on the internet while his every move was supposedly monitored by security officials			0
anti-terror police raided his home after finding fresh jihadi articles on the internet			0
if charges are brought , it would mean @entity11 standing trial in @entity0 for the first time , which could itself halt deportation proceedings			1
the worst - case scenario for the @entity187 is that police take no further action and @entity11 is once again granted bail			1
he is shortly due to go before @entity24 to ask for his release			0
the court has granted him bail on two previous occasions			0
if freed , @entity11 would go back under round - the - clock surveillance estimated to cost £ 100,000 a week , or £ 5million a year			1
@entity11 sits in a car as he is driven away from a @entity197 at the @entity198 in @entity199 in april last year after being re-arrested should the @entity187 ’s appeal against yesterday ’s verdict be refused , and no charges are brought , there would no longer be any grounds for holding him in jail or under effective house arrest			1
instead , he would be placed on a so - called @entity209 - a terror control order that would restrict his movements and use of the internet , while leaving him free to walk the streets for up to 12 hours a day			2
@entity215 normally only last two years , raising the prospect of @entity11 being free by mid- 2015			1
the alternative is for mrs may to try to get yet more assurances from @entity25 and seek permission to restart the deportation process			2
@entity11 has been linked to a long list of international terrorists			2
he featured in hate sermons found on videos in the flat of one of the september 11 bombers			0
in april 1999 , he was convicted in his absence on terror charges in @entity25 and sentenced to life imprisonment			2
it is on these charges that he faces a retrial			0
last night , the @entity187 said : ‘ this is not the end of the road			0
the government remains determined to deport @entity1			0
’ @entity240 's analysis @entity241 : home secretary @entity32 had hoped assurances from @entity25 would be enough to secure @entity1 's deportation for a politician with a reputation built on being a safe pair of hands , @entity32 has shown a surprising appetite for high - stakes gambles in recent months			1
in the case of @entity251 , she achieved spectacular success			0
the gamble she took on @entity1 , however , now looks like it is going to backfire			0
in both cases , mrs may was banking on a favourable diplomatic response from a foreign power – @entity25 , in @entity1 ’s case , and @entity259 for mr @entity251			2
a succession of craven @entity46 home secretaries had been prepared to bundle @entity263 ’s sufferer mr @entity251 on to a plane on hacking charges rather than risk upsetting the @entity259			0
mrs may courageously stood up to the @entity259 , saved mr @entity251 from potential suicide and suffered no meaningful damage to relations with her counterparts in the @entity274 administration			0
she has also been prepared to gamble over the future of the @entity155 , which she announced was being split in two earlier this week			0
the organisation is an incompetent shambles and she decided it was beyond saving			0
which brings us to the @entity1 nightmare			0
it dates back to this time last year , when the @entity80 delivered its long - awaited verdict on whether the hate - filled fanatic could be sent to face terror charges in @entity25			1
the court accepted there would be no risk of @entity1 himself being ill - treated ( a very important finding )			0
but the judges stopped his removal on the highly contentious grounds that some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture , denying him a fair trial			0
this argument had already been rejected by @entity0 ’s own @entity301			2
so mrs may had a choice			0
she could appeal the @entity82 ruling , which could have led to the court re-examining the case and possibly changing its verdict that @entity11 himself faced no danger			1
or she could seek reassurances from @entity25 no torture evidence would be used in court , and start the deportation all over again in @entity0 , on this narrow point of law			1
she went for the second option , staking her credibility on assurances from the @entity25			2
first the @entity24 immigration court said it was n’t happy with the undertakings mrs may had secured and blocked @entity1 ’s removal			0
now that decision has been rubber - stamped by the @entity28			0
@entity46 – and some @entity16 – are attacking mrs may ’s strategy and @entity11 and his lawyers are laughing at the government			2
mrs may has not given up , and will appeal to the @entity34			0
doubtless her determination to withdraw @entity0 from the clutches of the @entity80 has been strengthened			2
but , at the moment , it is @entity11 holding all the aces in a game mrs may – and this country – really can not afford to lose .			2

@entity71 rejects latest attempt by @entity337 to have @entity11 sent back to @entity25
released from jail in *february* last year under strict bail conditions
returned to prison this month for breaching rules but may be free in days
if last - ditch appeal fails he could never be deported from @entity0
