by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 after a 110 - year wait , @entity4 's @entity3 adventure very nearly lasted just seven days until @entity6 intervened to prolong their stay			1
but on the evidence of this lethargic and naïve performance , @entity9 's side will have to re-emerge with a newfound vigour and maturity when they face a final qualifier later this month			1
for now , though , relief is the overriding emotion on @entity17			0
@entity4 's players had already talked of winning the @entity38 in @entity81 next may but they were staring at a nightmare until substitute @entity6 pounced to volley home from six yards in the 80th minute			1
the goal keeps alive the dream of facing the likes of @entity87 at the @entity28 this season			1
to give their journey some perspective , exactly 10 years ago last night @entity4 were playing @entity92 in @entity93			0
they won 1 - 0			2
go back 15 years and they were getting beat 1 - 0 at @entity96 in @entity98 's bottom tier			1
@entity9 handed a full debut to £ 6million signing @entity100 as he attempted to inject some energy following a sluggish showing during the goalless draw in @entity104 last week			1
@entity105 signalled their intention from the off when @entity110 attempted to lob @entity39 from kick - off , the @entity109 goalkeeper panicked enough to scramble before gathering			0
battle : @entity114 fights for possession with @entity58 at the @entity28 but there was nothing he could do to prevent @entity23 's shock opener just 90 seconds later as @entity67 escaped down the right and drew back for @entity34 to apply a measured finish			1
the visitors threatened to double their advantage when a well - worked free - kick landed at the feet of @entity125 and he stung the palms of @entity39 with a vicious strike from 20 yards			2
@entity4 should have been level when @entity114 broke free on 15 minutes but his dink was read by @entity55 and the stopper spread his frame to block			0
long , though , was guilty of a glaring miss soon after when @entity100 screwed a shot in to his unmarked feet on the edge of the six - yard box			0
first he stabbed tamely at @entity138 before swiping at fresh air when the ball rebounded			0
it was an embarrassing passage which left the forward on the floor , face hidden in shame			0
proving his worth : new signing @entity148 storms through midfield with the ball but the @entity153 crowd – and @entity114 – exhaled a collective relief just moments later when @entity46 loaded a cross from the left and @entity31 rose to power a header into the bottom corner			2
@entity114 was enduring a miserable night and he somehow headed straight at nemesis @entity159 when a corner was deflected onto his brow just four yards from goal			0
@entity47 was introduced after half - time and his first touch – a 25 - yard drive – very nearly nestled in the top corner and @entity168 lashed narrowly over on 73 minutes			2
the home side continued to press and their prayers were answered when @entity6 connected with @entity100 ' knock - down just yards from goal .			1

@entity6 nets winner with ten minutes remaining at @entity28
@entity174 put visitors into shock lead after two minutes
@entity31 equalised for the hosts
@entity9 's side now await @entity38 play - off
