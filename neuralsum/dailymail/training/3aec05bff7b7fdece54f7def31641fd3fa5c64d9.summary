the federal government has appealed to the public to help them invent new hazmat suits for doctors and soldiers fighting the @entity6 epidemic in @entity7 and at home			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) has sent out an appeal for internet crowdsourcing to design a radical new anti-contamination suit that will lower the risk of health workers becoming infected			1
@entity9 wants applications submitted immediately and any successful design accepted will be awarded $ 1 million in funding			1
the @entity9 has set a deadline of two months on the whole process			1
it did not offer any guidance on current hazmat standards , only requiring ' entirely novel ' personal protection equipment			1
in addition to suits for those working on the front line of patient protection , the agency issued a demand for suits to be used by airport staff , @entity48 staff and for those involved in burials			1
current ideas suggested to @entity52 to overcome the heat stress of working in a hazmat suit are to equip them with cooling devices , stress detectors and thinner , stronger suits			1
precautions : dr. @entity60 , left , and dr. @entity61 , learn how to use personal protective gear during ebola preparedness training at the @entity64 the @entity9 is also looking for suits that provide face cooling shields and suits that are designed to be reusable			1
many of the personal protection suits are usable one - time only and when they are thrown away they increase the risk of accidental contamination			1
this comes as the @entity74 attorney general 's office said it is aware that members of the public are being sent email scams directly related to the @entity6 crisis			1
the emails promise to provide an @entity6 ' surplus personal protection kit ' costing $ 29 which will provide ' infection defense for emergency response teams , ' says the bogus email			2
' people being quarantined , ' one subject line reads			2
' ebola outbreak pandemic update , ' says another			0
' we suspect these emails are the handiwork of scammers seeking to take advantage of people ’s understandable fear and anxiety surrounding this international public health risk , ' attorney general @entity89 said in a statement			2
across the nation , @entity101 hospitals have increased @entity6 training sessions as health workers are placed on high alert for potential cases of the deadly virus in the @entity101 at the @entity109 on monday , doctors practiced pulling on bulky white suits and helmets that make them look more like astronauts than doctors preparing to fight a deadly disease			2
however training sessions on @entity6 preparedness for @entity101 medics and health workers heading to @entity7 can make the reality sink in - learning how to safely put on and take off the medical armor is crucial			1
no suits : volunteers in protective suit bury the body of a person who died from @entity6 in @entity126 , some 30 kilometers southeast of @entity127 , on october 7 , 20114 ' when you 're in the real deal , remember to take your time , ' biosafety expert @entity132 told doctors during a course this week in @entity135			2
suits splashed with patients ' vomit or blood must be removed carefully , he explained			0
' as much as possible , grab from the inside ' to avoid touching contaminated parts of the suits , he said			0
' be liberal with disinfectant			0
' across town , at @entity146 , doctors got a frightening test run this past weekend when a man coughing up blood said he had been in contact with someone from @entity153 , one of the countries in @entity7 where @entity6 spread			0
@entity157 staffers donned protective gear and immediately escorted him to a nearby isolation room , but tests showed he had bronchitis , not @entity6 , said dr. @entity164 , @entity166 's emergency medicine chief			0
@entity164 said he 's worked through similar scary disease threats - @entity168 , @entity169 , swine flu and smallpox after 9/11 - that were in some ways more worrisome because they can spread invisibly through the air			0
@entity6 is transmitted through direct contact with blood , vomit and other body fluids , or contact with needles , syringes or other objects contaminated by the virus			0
' at least with @entity6 we have a fighting chance , ' @entity164 said , ' because i know that it is coming from body fluid and i know if i wear my ( protective ) suit i 'm safe and i know if i do n't stick myself with a needle or cut myself with a scalpel i 'm safe			0
' ' there 's always going to be a little bit of fear in your head , ' @entity164 said			0
' but that 's ok			0
that 's what keeps us safe			0
