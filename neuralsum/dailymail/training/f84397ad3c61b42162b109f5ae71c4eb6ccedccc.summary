dozens of child sex offenders are still walking the streets because police refused to arrest them , according to a whistleblower , @entity5 has accused police of putting a cap on the number of child sex offenders they arrested for raping and abusing young girls			1
the veteran social worker , who was responsible for gathering the main evidence in the 2012 @entity14 child sex abuse case , said that as a result dozens of sex offenders were still walking the streets preying on children			1
dozens of child sex offenders are still walking the streets preying on children because police did not arrest them , whistleblower @entity5 said ( file picture ) miss @entity5 said limited resources and manpower during the investigation meant police had let sex offenders slip through the net			1
she said because police bosses became obsessed with convicting just nine perpetrators they left dozens free to continue raping and abusing young girls			1
‘ it ’s very shocking but there are dozens of child sex offenders still on the streets because they put a cap on the number of people they would arrest , ’ she said			1
‘ in the end this was just a tiny proportion of the number of offenders raping and abusing children and they were allowed to escape			1
‘ but not only did they cap the number of offenders but they also put a ceiling on the number of victims they would interview and proceed with			1
’ her explosive comments will stun @entity51 whose @entity52 yesterday launched a report highlighting the massive problem of child sexual exploitation			2
the report highlighted 13,000 cases of child sex abuse in the last six years but revealed that only 1,078 offenders were convicted			1
commissioner @entity60 has vowed to go back and review cases where victims have made sex abuse allegations			0
nine men , including these eight , were jailed for a total of 77 years for rape and trafficking after they preyed on girls as young as 13 - years - old but miss @entity5 , a social worker in @entity14 for more than 13 years , said the police were still doing far too little to combat on - street grooming			1
she said : ‘ it ’s still going on			0
the same perpetrators are still out there because police put a ceiling on the number of arrests			2
the actual number of suspects is huge but the number of victims is equally large			0
‘ they are still having to deal with the trauma of that on a day - to - day basis knowing no - one has ever been brought to justice for abusing them			0
’ in 2012 nine @entity89 men were jailed for a total of 77 years for rape and trafficking after they preyed on girls as young as 13 , plying them with drugs , alcohol and money before passing them round the group for sex			2
a subsequent report said the girls were allowed to fall into the hands of @entity100 grooming gangs because police and social workers may have been scared of seeming racist			2
the whistleblower said she was still disappointed that no one has been held to account for their failings and she was disappointed with the results of a report led by mp @entity110			0
the mp said the child sex abuse cases in @entity14 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , and @entity116 were a ‘ deafening wake - up call ’			1
a report by mp @entity110 found that recent child sex abuse cases were a ' deafening wake - up call ' , but the whistleblower said she was disappointed with action taken following its publication she has proposed measures aimed at improving arrest and conviction rates of child sex offenders in @entity127			1
these included a review of cases marked ‘ no further action ’ , new initiatives led by children themselves and more training for public sector workers to recognise grooming			0
but the whistleblower said she was still disappointed no one has been held to account for their failings and was disappointed with the results of the @entity110 report			0
she said : ‘ the victims deserve their evidence to be taken seriously			0
i referred dozens of cases to the police that i know were never acted upon			2
’ miss @entity5 , who fought for a @entity146 and was commended for her work by the @entity148 , was made redundant in february			1
@entity149 , chairman of @entity150 , said : ‘ it is grossly unfair that both the organisation and our police officer members collectively are singled out and blamed by some for what is a failure of the whole system			0
‘ we expect officers to build relationships with victims in the most difficult circumstances imaginable in a fraction of the time where often the education and social care system has failed to do so			0
only when we understand the whole problem and the challenges involved will society start to deal with those issues			0
’ detective superintendent @entity171 said : ‘ @entity172 was launched in the aftermath of @entity174 in 2012 to investigate all outstanding historic allegations of child sexual exploitation in @entity14 from the same era			0
‘ this investigation has examined massive amounts of material held by all agencies and provided support to a large number of victims as well as arresting a significant number of offenders			2
‘ @entity187 remains an on - going investigation with a large number of investigative staff deployed in building relationships of trust with victims and dealing with those responsible through the criminal justice system wherever possible			0
