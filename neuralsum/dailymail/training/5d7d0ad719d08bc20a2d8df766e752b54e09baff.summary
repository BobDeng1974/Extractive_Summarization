by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 24 february 2014 @entity2 : 09:13 est , 24 february 2014 it might looks like just a pretty fragment of crystal , but this blue substance is scientifically significant because it is the oldest piece of @entity8 , scientists claim			1
the tiny piece of zircon crystal was extracted from a rock on a sheep ranch in @entity13 and is a staggering 4.4billion years old			1
despite being microscopic , the crystal is helping scientists unravel how @entity8 became able to support life			1
a 4.4 billion - year - old zircon crystal ( pictured ) is now confirmed to be the oldest bit of the @entity8 's crust and is providing new insight into how the early @entity8 cooled from a ball of magma and formed continents just 160 million years after the formation of our solar system the fragment is 4.4billion years old - the oldest known material of any kind that has formed on @entity8			1
the study strengthens the theory of ‘ a cool early @entity8 ’ where temperatures were low enough for liquid water , oceans and a hydrosphere not long after the planet 's crust congealed from a sea of molten rock			1
the analysis of the zircon has helped portray how the @entity8 's crust formed during the first geologic eon of the planet			1
it could also help to shed light on how other habitable planets would form			2
by analysing the rock , geoscientists have confirmed that the @entity8 ’s crust formed at least 4.4 billion years ago , just 160 million years after the formation of our solar system			2
geoscience professor @entity51 at the @entity52 has come to the conclusion that @entity8 was not as harsh a place as scientists previously thought			1
the crystal ‘ confirms our view of how the @entity8 cooled and became habitable , ’ he said			1
scientists have previously found zircon fragments in sandstone rock , but have not revealed the exact type of rock where they found the ' new ' sample			0
professor @entity64 thinks that the study of the zircon crystal has helped portray how the @entity8 's crust formed during the first geologic eon of the planet			1
‘ this may also help us understand how other habitable planets would form , ’ he added			0
the study , which was published in the journal @entity76 , confirms that microscopic zircon crystals from @entity13 's @entity79 region crystallised 4.4 billion years ago			1
a few grains of zircon discovered in sandstone rock in @entity13 in the 1990s dated back between 4.2billion and 4.3billion years , so the ' new ' crystal is at least 100,000 years older			2
this is a timeline of the history of the planet that places the formation of the @entity79 zircon and a ' cool early @entity8 ' at 4.4 billion years the team of international scientists led by @entity91 used lead isotopes to date the @entity94 zircons and identify them as the oldest bits of the @entity8 's crust , as well as the oldest known material of any kind formed on @entity8			1
professor @entity64 said that the study strengthens the theory of ‘ a cool early @entity8 ’ where temperatures were low enough for liquid water , oceans and a hydrosphere not long after the planet 's crust congealed from a sea of molten rock			1
‘ the study reinforces our conclusion that @entity8 had a hydrosphere before 4.3 billion years ago , ’ and possibly life not long after , he said			2
the study was conducted using a new technique called atom - probe tomography that along with tried - and - tested ion mass spectrometry , which allowed the scientists to accurately establish the age and thermal history of the zircon by determining the mass of individual atoms of lead in the sample			2
instead of being randomly distributed in the sample as predicted , lead atoms in the zircon were clumped together , like ‘ raisins in a pudding , ’ professor @entity64 explained			0
the study confirms that zircon crystals from @entity13 's @entity132 ( pictured ) crystallised 4.4 billion years ago zircon is originally formed by crystallisation of magma and can be found in metamorphic rocks			2
the material is durable and resistant to chemical attack so that it is rarely destroyed , according to the @entity139			0
@entity140 can survive many geologic events , which can be recorded in rings of additional zircon that grow around the original crystal like tree rings			0
like a tiny time capsule , the zircon records these events - each one of which may last hundreds of millions of years			0
however , the core of the zircon remains unchanged and preserves the chemical characteristics of the rock in which it originally crystallised			0
the clusters of lead atoms formed one billion years after crystallization of the zircon , by which time the radioactive decay of uranium had created the lead atoms , which then diffused into clusters during reheating			0
‘ the zircon formed 4.4 billion years ago , and at 3.4 billion years , all the lead that existed at that time was concentrated in these hotspots , ’ professor @entity64 said			0
‘ this allows us to read a new page of the thermal history recorded by these tiny zircon time capsules , ’ he added			0
the formation , isotope ratio and size of the clumps , which are less than 50 atoms in diameter , can be read like a clock by scientists			0
the team of researchers measured oxygen isotope ratios , which give evidence of later cooling of the @entity8			0
‘ the @entity8 was assembled from a lot of heterogeneous material from the solar system , ’ said professor @entity64 , who explained that in its infancy , @entity8 experienced intense bombardment by meteors , including a collision with a @entity190 - sized object about 4.5 billion years ago			2
he said that collision ‘ formed our moon , and melted and homogenized the @entity8			0
our samples formed after the magma oceans cooled and prove that these events were very early			0
