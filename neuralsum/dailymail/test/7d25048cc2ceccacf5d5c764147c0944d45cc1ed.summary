@entity0 has dismissed claims he would be held to ransom by the @entity3 as prime minister – insisting ' that ai n't going to happen '			1
the @entity7 leader insisted @entity3 mps would not be able to dictate policy , even if he fails to win a majority and is reliant on them to stay in @entity11			1
it comes after the @entity14 first minister @entity13 this morning said @entity7 could only govern with the support of the @entity3 – and laid out what the party must do to get it			1
but speaking to the @entity21 tonight , mr @entity0 rejected claims the @entity3 would be ' calling the shots ' if @entity7 did not have a majority			1
the @entity7 leader : ' that ai n't gon na happen			1
that ai n't gon na happen			0
' @entity0 has dismissed claims he would be held to ransom by the @entity3 as prime minister – insisting ' that ai n't going to happen ' mr @entity0 's remarks come after the @entity14 first minister @entity13 this morning said @entity7 could only govern with the support of the @entity3 – and laid out what the party must do to get it @entity0 refused to admit he had got it wrong over the past five years about jobs , crime and the effect of tuition fees			1
the @entity7 leader confidently predicted that austerity would see unemployment soar , crime rise and the number of poor students going to university fall			1
but , in each case , the opposite has happened			0
mr @entity0 was challenged over mr balls ’ comment four years ago that it was fantasy to think we ’d get job growth with all the cuts being made in the public sector			1
in fact , presenter @entity20 pointed out that the number of jobs has increased by around two million – ‘ about a thousand a day ’			0
after at first not answering the question , the @entity7 leader was forced to accept : ‘ the number of jobs has gone up			1
’ on crime , mr @entity20 quoted shadow home secretary @entity77 who said earlier this @entity78 that the cuts are ‘ risking public safety and the fight against crime ’			0
when asked what had happened to crime , mr @entity0 eventually replied : ‘ certain areas of crime have gone down ; certain areas of crime have gone up			1
’ in fact , mr @entity89 pointed out , the crime survey of @entity92 and @entity93 showed it was at its lowest level since 1981			0
the presenter then moved on to the hike in tuition fees , quoting @entity98 saying in 2010 : ‘ how can these proposals do other than deter people from poor backgrounds from going to university ? ’ in fact , the number has increased by around a third , mr @entity20 said			0
following repeated questioning , he admitted : ‘ there are some – there are some more people going to university from different backgrounds			0
’ he said his party ’s judgement had not been wrong on the issue , saying : ‘ no , it was n’t			0
’ but mr @entity20 asked : ‘ on issues about jobs , crime , social mobility , comments , predictions made by people in your team turn out to have been wrong			2
‘ these are not minor quibbles are they ? these are huge issues that have had a large part to play in the last five years			0
’ the @entity7 leader replied : ‘ i do n’t think that ’s a judgement that people are going to make at the election			1
’ when asked whether the @entity3 would be able to tell @entity7 which measures it could introduce he replied : ' they 're not going to tell us , they 're not going to tell us			2
look , i 'm very clear about that			0
' he refused to say whether the party with the largest number of seats should get first chance to form a government			0
it comes amid a flurry of polls suggesting that the @entity150 will finish as the largest party , but fall short of having enough mps – even with @entity154 support – to form a @entity156 government			2
this would leave the @entity7 in pole position to try to form a minority government with the support of the @entity3			1
mr @entity0 , speaking to the @entity21 's @entity20 tonight , refused to be drawn on the what he would do in the event of another hung parliament where no party has enough mps to form a majority on its own			1
he said : ' i 'm not going to get into post election speculation			0
' he added : it 's for people in the @entity171 to decide how they vote on measures put before the @entity173 and that will be the case after the election			0
' in the interview mr @entity0 also took ' full responsibility ' for @entity7 's poor polling in @entity14 – with experts predicting that the party is on course to lose 40 mps north of the border			1
mr @entity0 also refused to say how much a @entity7 - led government would be borrowing by the end of the next parliament			1
he said : ' the way you get credibility is not by picking out an arbitrary number today in six years ' time			0
' but the @entity7 leader insisted he did not agree with ms @entity13 who has called for increases in government spending and an end to cuts regardless of the deficit			1
it came after ms @entity13 released her ' ransom note ' of policies which she would demand in exchange for putting mr @entity0 in power			1
the @entity3 and @entity7 manifestos both commit to re-introducing the 50p top rate of tax , scrapping the bedroom tax and beefing up the energy regulator to drive down family bills			2
ms @entity13 also pledged to help @entity7 reduce tuition fees by £ 3,000 to £ 6,000 a year – even though @entity14 has already scrapped student fees			2
however , at least one big stumbling block remains to a deal between the two parties – @entity216 's nuclear deterrent			0
ms @entity13 re-stated the @entity3 's opposition to renewing @entity218			2
the manifesto states : ' a vote for the @entity3 is a vote to halt progress on @entity218 renewal , delivering a saving of £ 100 billion over the next 35 years			2
' however , @entity7 have pledged not to make any deal over nuclear weapons and are committed to maintaining a ' minimum , credible , independent nuclear capability '			0
the @entity150 said the @entity3 manifesto was mr @entity230 's ' ransom note ' to labour and would result in higher government borrowing and tax increases in @entity92			2
a spokesman pointed to the @entity3 manifesto commitment to increase spending			2
unveiling the party 's manifesto in @entity29 , ms @entity13 demanded an end to government cuts , higher welfare spending and big hikes in the minimum wage in return for propping up a @entity7 government @entity14 first minister @entity13 this morning said @entity7 could only govern with the support of the @entity3 – and laid out what the party must do to get it the manifesto states : ' @entity8 will demand an end to austerity			1
we oppose further spending cuts and propose modest spending increases - of 0.5 per cent above inflation - in each year of the next @entity78			0
under our plan , the deficit will still reduce each year , but there will be at least an additional £ 140 billion across the @entity216			0
' the @entity150 said this meant £ 148 billion in extra government borrowing and insisted @entity7 would have to bow down to the @entity3 demands to stay in power			1
former @entity14 first minister @entity263 has insisted @entity14 can ' call the tune ' in the next @entity78			0
in last week 's tv debate , ms @entity13 said : ' the polls will show that @entity0 is n't strong enough to get rid of the @entity150 on his own			2
' what i say to @entity0 is i want to replace the @entity150 with something different and something better , something more progressive			0

the @entity7 leader insists @entity8 will not be able to dictate policy
insisted the @entity3 would not ' call the shots ' if there was a hung parliament
comes after @entity13 said he could only govern with @entity3 support
she promised to use @entity3 *influence* to increase government spending
mr @entity0 also accepted his doom - laden claims about jobs were wrong
before the *recent* jobs boom he said millions would be put on the dole
