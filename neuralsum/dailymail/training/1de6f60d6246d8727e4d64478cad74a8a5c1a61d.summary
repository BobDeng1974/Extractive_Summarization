by @entity0 new robotic super-tills are set to replace the nation ’s supermarket check - out workers			2
the days of someone sitting at a check - out , switching and flipping items to make sure the barcode can be scanned before sorting out the payment are clearly numbered			2
@entity9 yesterday unveiled a bank of the super-tills at its new extra store in @entity13 in a major policy shift that is already being adopted by some of its rivals			1
@entity9 yesterday unveiled a bank of the super-tills at its new @entity21 store in @entity13 in a major policy shift the theory is that scanners built in to the supersize check - outs automatically scan every item put on the conveyor belt , regardless of which way up it is , so removing the human element			1
a normal worker takes up to three seconds to scan a single item , however the rise of the machines means the new hi - tech version can do the same job three times faster – one per second			1
at the same time , customers will pack their items and pay automatically with a card , so allowing the entire process to be managed without the need for a shop worker			1
most supermarkets have already installed self - scan tills for those picking up a few items for their evening meal on the basis of a claim that it is quicker and more convenient for customers			0
however , the millions who have struggled with scanners and wrestled with ‘ unidentified items in the bagging area ’ will confirm the process does not always run smoothly			0
scanners in the supersize check - outs scan every item on the conveyor belt , regardless of which way up it is it has been tipped as ' revolutionary ' , cutting the time it takes to scan an item from three seconds to one each of the robotic super-tills can send products on a conveyor belt to one of three packing areas , which enables up to three sets of customers to be using it at any one time			1
four of the state - of - the - art machines have been installed at @entity9 ’s 80,000 sq ft @entity81 , which accounts for nearly a third of all those available to customers			1
shopper , helped by @entity9 employee , empties trolley on to the conveyor belt			1
items pass through an arch which scans them from all sides – 360 degrees – to identify barcode			2
once through scanner , items are carried by the belt to a circular platform			2
@entity98 in the middle of platform spins the items into the first of 3 packing areas			0
once all the shopping is through , second customer can then load items on the belt			2
a wall rises around the first shoppers items , which means the second customer ’s shopping is diverted into a separate packing area			0
the same pattern is repeated with a third shopper			0
each of the three packing areas has its own payment point , where customers can pay with cash or card			0
there is also a dispenser for bags , which customers can take freely to pack shopping			0
@entity9 said it had already received a positive customer feedback from a trial of one of the checkouts in @entity131 in @entity132 , but the new @entity13 store is taking the technology to a new level			1
the super-till has been developed by @entity137 and is similar to ones that have been developed for @entity139 and put on trial at a store in @entity142 and operate at speeds of up to 100 items per minute			2
@entity9 said the new technology will take the stress out of getting through its tills , because people will not feel under pressure to pack and pay			1
a spokesman said : ‘ customers can feel pressurised when they have customers behind them at the checkouts			0
this is about making it a more relaxed experience			0
’ the firm stressed the check - out workers are not being made redundant , but rather they are being switched to other roles in the stores , such as helping people to negotiate the aisles or running taste tests and demonstrations			0
@entity137 ’s @entity163 told @entity165 magazine : ‘ supermarkets such as @entity9 must differentiate themselves to attract and retain shoppers			1
' as consumers increasingly expect a better experience , incorporating innovative software and hardware becomes increasingly important			0
’ the changes at the @entity13 store are part of a major revamp of @entity9 outlets to try and turn them into surrogate high streets with a range of stores and services beyond the normal groceries			1
many will have family restaurants under the @entity186 brand , together with @entity187 + @entity189 coffee shops and @entity191 bakeries			0
a number will also have community areas which can be used for exercise classes or mother and toddler groups			0
@entity9 insists check - out workers will not be made redundant but assume different roles within the stores the @entity13 store includes a new drive - through centre for people to collect items they have bought on the @entity9 website			1
there is also a @entity206 department offering a dedicated area for tablets , smartphones and the latest games consoles			0
it is the first store to include a kitchen in a community room that @entity9 will use to provide cooking lessons for children in conjunction with the @entity217 .			1

@entity9 has *launched* the technology at @entity13 branch , rivals to follow
scans every item put on conveyor belt regardless of which way up it is
normal worker takes three seconds per item , new machine takes one
@entity9 says staff will be *redeployed*
