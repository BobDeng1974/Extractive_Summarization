by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 click here to read @entity4 columnist and former @entity7 defender @entity6 's experience of timewasting			1
i did n't actually think @entity10 wasted too much time			1
as a professional team you do use up some , but there have been much clearer , embarrassing examples down the years			2
the only advice i was given about this was when refereeing in @entity18			2
the worst offenders were @entity20 under @entity21 , and i was told that there is absolutely no point cautioning a player for timewasting			1
why ? because if you 've allowed it to last that long , to become that blatant , then it 's simply not worth it			2
you 've not done your job properly in the first place			0
video : scroll down to watch @entity32 on @entity10 's spoiling tactics tick tock ! @entity35 tries to keep the ball from @entity37 in an attempt to waste time @entity41 trend : time - wasting is more prevalent in @entity18 - where one of @entity35 's previous teams @entity20 was especially guilty you officiate these situations on gut feeling and experience			0
it 's down to you - these things are all about game management			0
time - wasting is n't something that really sticks in the memory for me			0
it is n't particularly bad in this country			0
but like everything else it will begin to come in more and more			0
we did n't used to dive as much , or go down at the slightest bit of contact			0
there is a way to eradicate any threat of timewasting of course			1
the solution is to have an independent timekeeper			1
players are always bothering referees about the clock and additional time , but that would be taken away with someone sat up in the stands			1
having 30 minutes each half with the clock stopped when the ball is out of play is the way forward , but that 's far too sensible to ever be implemented			0
clock watching : a way to put a stop to time - wasting would be to employ an independent timekeeper ( not him ) stop being so slow ! @entity37 ( second left ) appears to appeal to @entity10 players as the referee looks on have a word : referee @entity89 speaks to @entity90 about taking too long over goal kicks			1

former referee @entity0 was told not to caution players for timewasting
poll believes timewasting has *grown* from @entity98 *football* trends
an independent timekeeper and 30min halves would be a solution
