labour ministers ‘ suppressed ’ warnings about hospitals blamed for causing thousands of needless deaths , a senior government adviser said yesterday			1
in a devastating intervention , professor sir @entity5 said previous health ministers had presided over a ‘ denial machine ’ designed to prevent criticism of the @entity10			1
a report by the @entity10 ’s medical director , sir @entity12 , tomorrow will detail a shocking catalogue of failure at 14 hospital trusts held responsible for up to 13,000 ‘ excess deaths ’ since 2005			1
health secretary @entity17 is expected to place at least 10 of the hospitals in ‘ special measures ’ immediately , with @entity10 troubleshooters parachuted in to take over what are described as ‘ failing regimes ’			1
investigation : @entity24 is part one of 14 hospital trusts where ' excessive deaths ' are being examined casualty , maternity , geriatric and other units could be shut down as ministers order drastic action to prevent further unnecessary deaths			1
the report will also highlight a culture in which warnings of dangerous practice were routinely ignored or buried			2
ministers received 386 separate warnings about conditions at @entity39 alone between 2005 and 2010			1
sir @entity5 , an expert on hospital death rates who was an adviser on the report , said : ‘ the @entity44 seems to have been , until recently , a denial machine			1
there has been a denial of the death rate data			0
’ he said @entity50 ministers had been in denial about the issue for most of the last decade – with the result that health regulators were actively discouraged from highlighting problems			1
he told @entity56 : ‘ the government that was responsible for providing the service was , uniquely , also monitoring its quality			1
so you had a conflict in which where there was a problem with quality they could n’t really say what it was			0
‘ things were suppressed , ( there was ) spin , everything ... effectively they had to produce a good news story for ministers			1
‘ the impression in those days was , the problem was ministerial pressure , even from @entity76			2
’ sir @entity5 also criticised the controversial @entity10 chief sir @entity77 , claiming that he had misleadingly suggested that the scandal at @entity80 trust hospitals was a one - off			1
his comments drew a furious response from shadow health secretary @entity84 , who served as health secretary in the last year of @entity87 ’s government			2
‘ to be honest , i ’m fed up of these general accusations being hurled in my direction , ’ he said			1
‘ i will account for all of the things that i did as secretary of state			0
’ mr @entity84 insisted he had acted on warnings , including ordering a report into the @entity95 scandal and handing warnings to five other hospitals with high death rates			2
he said he had never received a ‘ specific warning ’ about @entity100			2
and he claimed the situation at some of the hospitals had got worse since the election			0
but one @entity106 insider said the government planned to give @entity50 ‘ both barrels ’ when sir @entity12 ’s report is published tomorrow			1
a @entity111 source said : ‘ we now know @entity50 set up a hopeless regulator whose views should n’t have been trusted			0
‘ @entity84 allowed people with no medical training to inspect hospitals			0
it was a disaster waiting to happen			0
' despicable ' : a coroner heard four separate inquests in one day over ' incompetence ' at @entity123 ‘ but what is shocking is how @entity125 – including @entity84 and even @entity87 himself – appear to have been leaning heavily on officials to keep problems covered up			0
’ @entity129 commissioned the @entity12 report in february after @entity132 ’s inquiry into the @entity95 scandal exposed appalling lapses in both care of patients and the regulation of hospitals			1
sir @entity12 has been examining 14 hospital trusts that have been outliers on mortality indexes over the last two years			1
he also examined infection levels , the number of patients suffering from preventable and potentially fatal neglect and numbers of so - called ‘ never events ’ , such as operations on the wrong part of the body or surgical instruments left inside a patient			2
between them , the 14 hospitals have paid £ 234 million in negligence settlements in the past three years , although many of the cases will date back far longer as the legal battles often take several years			0
infection : @entity160 , 84 , died after contracting mrsa while in @entity123 with a fractured hip former @entity163 pilot @entity160 , 84 , died from @entity161 after being admitted to @entity164 with a fractured hip			0
the treatment he received there was ‘ despicable ’ , the coroner said			2
according to his family , the twice - widowed grandfather was often unable to reach his meals because his table was too far from his bed			0
his son @entity174 , 58 , said : ‘ on one occasion i found my dad lying in his own excrement which had dried on the bed sheets			0
it was after mr @entity160 pointed out filth smeared over an abscess on his father ’s leg that nurses cleaning him up discovered the infection , which turned out to be @entity161			0
mr @entity160 , who flew in @entity186 with the @entity163 during the @entity187 , died on april 5 , 2006			0
‘ i have no doubt he would still be alive today if he ’d had better care , ’ his son said			2
details of mr @entity160 ’ death formed one of four separate inquests heard in one afternoon by coroner @entity196 in which relatives in all cases complained of incompetence at @entity201			0
mr @entity196 said staff had failed to carry out the most simple tasks			0
he added : ‘ i would have concerns about any hospital which was referred to in four different inquests in one day where people raise doubts about the basic care given to their relatives			2
’ the 14 hospital trusts are : @entity212 and @entity213 in @entity214 ; @entity215 ; @entity216 ; the @entity217 , @entity218 ; @entity219 , @entity220 ; @entity221 and @entity222 ; @entity123 , @entity223 ; @entity224 , @entity225 ; @entity226 , @entity214 ; @entity227 , @entity228 ; @entity229 , @entity80 ; @entity230 ; @entity231 ; and @entity232			1
mr @entity17 will announce tomorrow that most of the hospitals are still failing and will be placed in so - called special measures			0
troubleshooting teams will be sent in with a free hand to order changes			0
mr @entity17 last night said : ‘ poor care in the @entity10 is completely unacceptable which is why we commissioned this review			1
for too long problems in the @entity10 have been allowed to go on unchecked			2
we will act in the best interests of patients and ensure that where problems are found we take action immediately			0
’ senior @entity247 believe the row could help to neutralise @entity50 ’s poll lead on the @entity10			1
some on the @entity251 also believe it poses the party a challenge			0
@entity50 ’s former general secretary @entity255 said : ‘ @entity251 is going to have to find a much better response to the series of @entity10 scandals than “ i love the @entity10 ”			1

prof sir @entity5 said health ministers tried to stop @entity10 criticism
report by sir @entity12 tomorrow will reveal failure at 14 hospital trusts
the trusts are ' responsible ' for up to 13,000 ‘ excess deaths ’ since 2005
