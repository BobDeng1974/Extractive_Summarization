@entity0 are set to launch a formal investigation into the anti-semitic banner that marred @entity4 's goalless draw against @entity5			1
the banner displayed among the @entity8 supporters during the @entity10 tie read : ‘ only @entity12 and @entity13 ’ — an allusion to the tv comedy @entity11			1
delegates from @entity19 football ’s governing body were made aware of the banner before half - time , yet no effort was made to take it down			1
anti-discrimination body @entity35 meanwhile has urged @entity0 to send a clear message to clubs around @entity19 after the incident			1
kick it out said it had been made aware of the unsavoury scenes via a ‘ large number ’ of @entity4 fans on @entity43 and confirmed it had informed @entity45 ( @entity45 )			1
@entity45 said it has made an official complaint to @entity0 , who is officially awaiting the match delegate ’s report			1
‘ these incidents seem to be happening in particular countries and in certain parts of @entity19 where they do n’t take them as seriously as we do on our shores , ’ @entity35 ’s media and communications manager @entity50 said			1
@entity4 manager @entity58 condemned the anti-semitic banner a pitch invader is detained during the @entity10 clash in @entity62 on thursday night ‘ incidents are n’t dealt with in the appropriate manner within those countries - if they do n’t take a firm stance and they ’re allowed to slide , the reality is it will continue to happen			1
‘ we need @entity0 to take a lead , which they have done more over the last couple of years , and demonstrate clearly that these sorts of incidents are completely unacceptable			1
’ @entity50 added : ‘ it ’s always disappointing when any incident like this occurs			0
‘ it ’s disheartening , it ’s not acceptable in any way and , after a thorough investigation , it needs to be dealt with in the appropriate manner			0
’ @entity4 manager @entity58 branded the banner as ‘ unacceptable ’ and ‘ disrespectful ’			1
he said : ‘ i did n’t see ( it ) but the club is aware			0
it is a shame as it was a great atmosphere			0
it is very disrespectful , unacceptable and a massive problem for us			2
’ if @entity5 are found guilty they could have part of their ground shut for @entity19 competition			2
there was a large police presence in the stadium despite only 150 @entity4 fans making the trip they were kicked out of this competition when it was the @entity10 in 2007 after crowd trouble marred their first qualifying round tie at @entity108 ’s @entity107			2
on the pitch , this match was less eventful			0
as goalless draws go , this was pretty awful			0
but @entity58 knows it could have been worse			2
but for a 10 - minute spell at the start , @entity5 dominated without finding the goal their performance probably deserved			0
@entity58 made 10 changes from the side who started against @entity122 on saturday , @entity118 the only survivor from the 2 - 2 draw			1
there were full debuts for summer signings @entity128 and @entity129 , while @entity130 was handed another chance to impress ahead of @entity132			0
@entity4 striker @entity130 rattled the crossbar from a tight angle with a thunderous shot @entity136 is thrown off the ball by @entity5 's @entity138 on wednesday night , @entity58 insisted the @entity10 is a priority for @entity4 , although a host of first - teamers did not travel			1
@entity4 fans need convincing , however : just 150 made the trip			1
@entity130 nearly gave them something to shout about in the first minute , hitting the crossbar with a sharp angled shot after @entity5 failed to deal with @entity148 ’s corner			0
@entity5 , who have won all five in their league this season , gradually found their stride with @entity153 and @entity154 , in particular , causing @entity4 problems down the right			2
@entity157 saw his shot blocked by @entity128 in the 15th minute following excellent work from impressive right winger @entity160			0
the @entity163 manager had left regular left back @entity164 in @entity165 ; he may have regretted that given @entity148 ’s difficult start			0
@entity136 tried to shift the flow of the game , but his runs down the right were too few and far between for @entity58 ’s liking			2
on the half - hour @entity160 again eluded @entity148 before picking out @entity172 at the back post , only for the @entity5 captain to blaze over			1
left back @entity148 was given a start in @entity4 's first @entity10 game of the season @entity132 of @entity4 shoots wide with an acrobatic attempt on goal @entity148 ’s nightmare continued three minutes after the restart as he was booked for hauling down @entity182			0
@entity118 denied @entity160 twice before @entity58 decided enough was enough , throwing on @entity183 and @entity132			0
but @entity5 continued to pour forward : @entity172 sent a shot from outside the area over the bar before directing a diving header at goal after 76 minutes			0
@entity130 ’s 25 - yard free - kick straight at @entity5 ’s wall in the 83rd minute summed up @entity4 ’ night in an attacking sense			2
@entity4 's @entity192 , left , is challenged by @entity5 's @entity193 @entity4 's @entity194 , right , and @entity5 's @entity196 battle for the ball			0

@entity58 hit out at the ' unacceptable ' and ' disrespectful ' banner
