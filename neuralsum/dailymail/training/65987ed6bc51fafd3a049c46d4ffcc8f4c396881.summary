@entity0 says his plan will cut taxes while bringing jobs the president leaves tomorrow for a @entity6 vacation at a $ 50,000 - per - week farm critics like @entity9 blast the president for such an expensive sojourn at such a critical time by @entity14 reporter last updated at 11:31 pm on 17th august 2011 president @entity0 says he has a plan to boost jobs and relieve the long - term unemployed while cutting taxes - and he 'll reveal it when he gets back from his vacation			1
a @entity20 official said mr @entity0 's proposals would be fresh ones , not a rehash of plans he has pitched for weeks and still supports , like his idea of an ‘ infrastructure bank ’ to fund construction jobs			1
however , the @entity29 people wo n't hear details of the proposals , or any other solutions to the nation 's economic woes , until @entity0 returns from his summer sojourn in @entity6 , the wealthy island enclave off @entity36 , where his family will vacation for the third straight year			1
got a plan ? as he ends his three - day campaign bus tour , president @entity0 says he has a plan for the economy and stalled job numbers as he gets set for a vacation to @entity6 mr @entity0 's version will challenge the new ' supercommittee ' of @entity46 to go beyond its goal of $ 1.5 trillion in deficit reduction			1
confirming the deficit - reduction part of his plan directly , @entity0 told a rural town hall crowd in @entity52 on wednesday : ' i do n't think it 's good enough for us to just do it part way			1
if we 're going to do it , let 's go ahead and fix it			0
' @entity0 's major economic speech will come right after the sept. 5 @entity63 holiday			1
@entity65 , a spokesman for @entity20 speaker @entity66 , said via @entity67 that @entity0 could scrap the speech and just hand over a detailed plan to @entity46			1
' seriously , just drop it in the mail			0
podium not required , ’ mr @entity65 's tweet said			0
getaway : when president @entity0 goes to @entity6 , he usually stays at @entity76 , a sprawling property that rents for about $ 50,000 a week mr @entity0 will seek to use his economic proposals as leverage against @entity64 in @entity46 , hoping to show a nation disgusted with gridlock that he is the one trying to get results			1
@entity0 's re-election campaign and the @entity20 are also sure to use any specific ideas from the president as a way to blunt attacks from the @entity64 hoping to run against him in next year 's presidential election			1
already , @entity0 has been previewing his line of attack			2
in @entity52 on wednesday , @entity0 is likely to touch on his economic plans during the final leg of a campaign - themed @entity94 bus tour			1
@entity64 @entity20 contender @entity96 , campaigning in @entity95 , needled @entity0 for showing up with too little and too late on the economy			2
taking jabs : @entity64 presidential candidates like @entity96 are using the opportunity to take some digs at the president for going on vacation at such a crucial time			1
' but we appreciate the fact that he 's going to devote some time to it , ' @entity96 said			2
' not just going to be on the bus tour , not just going to be vacationing in @entity6 , but giving some thought to the @entity29 people			2
' @entity0 is due to leave @entity111 thursday for the 10 - day trip at the $ 50,000 - a - week @entity76 , but he ’s not the only one taking a break this summer			1
most lawmakers left town in early august , right after reaching a deal with the @entity20 to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a potentially catastrophic government default			0
@entity46 is n't expected to get back to work until early september			0
former president @entity120 was heavily criticized after spending nearly 500 days at his @entity122 ranch within his two terms with the lawmakers away , there 's probably not much @entity0 could get done on the economic front even if he did cancel his trip			1
and even if @entity46 stayed in @entity111 , too , there are no quick fixes for the country 's deep economic problems			0
@entity132 , a @entity64 consultant , said both @entity0 and @entity46 ' do n't have anything to act upon			2
' he added : ' if anyone knew what the answer to this was , they 'd do it			0
' then there 's the issue of perception			0
@entity0 will be vacationing at a rented multi-million dollar estate on an island known as a haven for the rich and famous at a time when millions of @entity29 are out of work and countless more are financially strapped			1
@entity149 's aides were so concerned about vacation perceptions that they polled the public before deciding where he should go			2
while @entity149 preferred trips to @entity6 , polling sometimes pushed him toward places like the more rugged @entity156 , @entity157			2
former president @entity120 was criticized for spending nearly 500 days at his ranch in @entity122 , @entity159 , during his two terms in office			0
he was there in august 2001 when he received a @entity164 briefing paper warning him of @entity166 's intentions to strike the @entity29 — just over a month before the sept. 11 attacks			0
and in 2005 , he remained on vacation after @entity169 swamped @entity170 and devastated the @entity171			0
his presidency suffered from his response to the storm and his decision to not immediately return to @entity111			0
that 's a wrap : president @entity0 leaves for @entity6 tomorrow after a three - day economic bus tour also seen as a campaign - @entity179 some of @entity0 's prior vacations have come under fire as well			1
last summer , he was chided for not taking his family on a @entity171 vacation following the @entity185 oil spill			0
when he finally did travel to the @entity192 for a weekend , his attempts to soothe public concern about the safety of the region 's beaches were tainted when the @entity20 released a photo of the president and daughter @entity195 swimming in water that turned out not to be the @entity171			0
' fired ' up : @entity9 has taken a swipe at president @entity0 , saying the president takes vacation 's ' constantly ' and now 's not the right time perhaps mindful of the president 's image , the @entity20 booked @entity0 on a three - day , economy - focused bus tour through the @entity94 right before the start of his vacation			1
he also travelled to @entity206 last week to speak at a factory that makes batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles			0
on tuesday , real estate mogul @entity9 led the attack on the president over his escapes			1
' we have a president that 's constantly - whether it 's @entity6 or someplace else - constantly on vacation			1
i mean , all the time he 's on vacation ! ' so i think it sends a very , very bad message			2
we have to work in this country to bring it back			0
' @entity20 press secretary @entity224 said he does n't think the public begrudges the president a break to recharge and spend time with his family			2
besides , @entity224 said , the president is never really off - duty , since @entity20 advisers go with him and he still receives regular briefings on national security and the economy			2
' the presidency travels with you			0
he will be in constant communication , ' said @entity224 , also noting that @entity6 is close enough to @entity111 that @entity0 could make it home quickly if needed			1
short of an unexpected crisis , @entity0 seems determined to follow through with his @entity6 plans			1
and he has adamantly rejected the notion of calling @entity46 back from its break			0
' the last thing we need is @entity46 spending more time arguing in @entity111 , " he said during a speech in @entity206 last week			2
' what i figure is , they need to spend more time out here listening to you and hearing how fed up you are			0
' the big bus : president @entity0 boards the huge black coach that has drawn fire for its imposing appearance , as well as the revelation that the vehicle was made in @entity259 meanwhile , the president 's plans to kickstart the economy have been overshadowed by the hulking , $ 1.1million bus he is using to tour the country on his three - day @entity94 tour - and it was made in @entity259			1
model : @entity268 - 45 made by the @entity270 - based coach company @entity269 cost : $ 1.1m security features : armoured doors plus a device dubbed the ' football ' that allows the president to remotely control @entity29 nuclear weapons			1
communications : satellite equipment allows @entity0 to communicate and teleconference worldwide			2
additional features : slide out panels to increase floorspace , flat - screen tv , couches			0
economy : 6.7 mpg other owners : @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity288 the big black coach has already drawn fire for its imposing appearance - it has been likened to @entity293 's helmet , a police mortuary truck , and called the @entity295 from @entity296 - and the revelation the vehicle was made by @entity270 - based company @entity299 will dent mr @entity0 's chances of reviving his flailing polls			1
dubbed ' greyhound one ' , the fearsome looking machine stands in stark contrast to the usual campaign trail buses , cheerfully emblazoned with slogans and decked in the @entity308			0
@entity309 came up with the @entity311 - themed suggestion as the president entered day two of his @entity94 tour on the new $ 1.1million bus purchased by the @entity315			1
the @entity317 's @entity316 added that the formidable looking machine was , ' big , blocky , black , with painted - out windows			0
' ' it looks more like a police mortuary van than a symbol of hope arriving on your street			0
' the impenetrable - looking conveyance is the size of a cross-country @entity304 , painted all in black , with dark tinted windows and flashing red and blue lights			0
@entity315 spokesman @entity330 emphasised that the bus was n't purchased solely for the president and would be used for other dignitaries in the future .			0
