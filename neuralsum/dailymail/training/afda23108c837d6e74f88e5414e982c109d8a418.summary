the team coach trundled into the @entity2 car park shortly after 6pm			1
there was no fuss , no fanfare , only a small welcoming committee			2
as @entity8 made his way off the bus , followed by his coaching staff then his squad , there was no ringing adulation or none of those famous songs to get them in the mood for the crucial assignment that was looming			1
last season , as @entity21 were trying to win the title , you could n’t move on @entity24 when the team arrived at the stadium : flags decorated the streets , flares would be set off , songs were sung			1
the fans did all they possibly could to lift @entity8 and his men over the line			1
a raft of @entity50 ’s greatest names have buckled under the frenzy that has tumbled down from the terraces			2
@entity36 , so the theory went , would be next			2
so sure that the atmosphere would play a part in helping @entity21 produce the performance they needed , @entity8 even devoted 183 words of his programme notes to talk about the mystique of such occasions			1
‘ your role is critical , ’ @entity8 wrote			2
‘ i have had my own experiences of seeing the power of @entity24 under the lights			2
i would ask that you play the same crucial role as you always do			2
hopefully we can produce a result and a performance to make you proud			1
’ now there is no doubting @entity24 has witnessed some improbable victories , with @entity73 ( 1977 ) , @entity74 ( 2002 ) and @entity75 ( 2005 ) being prime examples of evenings when the stadium shook to its old foundations			0
for the warm - up , there was muted apprehension from the stands , rather than support for their team @entity88 's performance lacked any kind of conviction , much like the majority of the team but one thing tends to get overlooked when atmosphere comes on to the agenda : players and teams create it			1
fans get up for these encounters when they have faith that the men they are going to support will produce for them			1
it is a two - way street			0
at this moment , @entity21 ’s fan s are struggling for belief and that was apparent from an early stage			1
during the warm up , many on @entity109 stood in muted apprehension as the squad went through their paces			2
in the far corner of the stadium , by contrast , @entity36 ’s followers were finding their voice			0
even the singing of you ’ll @entity119 lacked oomph and the anxiety levels had increased just 42 seconds into the encounter , as @entity125 and @entity126 exchanged unnecessary passes , leading @entity128 to slice the ball out of play			1
you can tell early on in this arena how things are going to unfold and , suddenly , every errant pass was greeted with groans , each decision that went against @entity21 sparking a protests			1
if a man in @entity140 dithered in possession , they were barracked to quickly find an option			0
such was the frustration at the lethargy in @entity21 ’s play , there was a chant of ‘ @entity148 ’ to try and galvanise some response but , frankly , it was half - hearted and lacked any kind of conviction			1
words , quite frankly , that sum up the team			2
belatedly , the mood changed but that , more than anything , was down to the local hero			0
@entity161 ’s thundering challenge in the 62nd minute sparked some defiance then his superb free - kick cranked the decibels up to a level they have not been at since @entity167 came here in april			0
in stark contrast to last season , the @entity21 fans were disappointing on their big @entity40 night the @entity36 fans found their voice in the warm - up , and continued to support their team throughout the match ‘ this crowd push and they create for the team and they make it difficult , ’ @entity177 , @entity36 ’s manager , noted			1
‘ the last 10 minutes were hard			0
@entity21 have quality and when they had their first shot on target and they scored			1
’ much to their frustration , however , the second goal that would have carried them into the last 16 proved elusive , despite the frenzied exhortations			0
it was too little , too late			0
and that , to @entity8 and company , will be a source of immense regret			0
‘ we want to be playing in @entity50 , ’ said @entity8			0
‘ the history for the club is strong			0
alongside that we want to finish in the top four and that is something we will try and do			0
’ at this point in a bitterly disappointing campaign , such goals seem a long way off			0
@entity24 has lost its spark .			0

last season , @entity21 fans lined the streets before matches when the team were aiming to win the @entity211 title
on *tuesday* , there was no ringing adulation for the squad as they arrived
the fans ' *rendition* of you *'ll* @entity119 was *lacklustre*
@entity21 's performance on the pitch was much the same for the majority
