@entity0 has reminded @entity1 of the importance of ' trust ' as his @entity4 hopes rest in @entity7 's hands on wednesday night			1
city need to win or earn a goalscoring draw away to @entity10 to progress to the @entity4 knockout stages – the minimum requirement of @entity14 's ambitions for the club			1
but even that wo n't be enough if @entity1 , who have already qualified as group winners , lose at home to @entity20			1
@entity0 on the touchline during @entity8 's 1 - 0 win over @entity23 on saturday if @entity7 's @entity1 lose to @entity20 , @entity8 will be out of the @entity4 in that case @entity24 would finish ahead of @entity8 if they finish level on points because of their better head - to - head record			1
although @entity1 have a heavy injury list and crowded fixture programme , @entity0 says he is not worried the @entity32 may see the value in fielding a weakened team that could knock @entity8 out of the competition early			1
' i am not thinking about that			0
i think strong teams and big teams always try to win their games because it is important for the trust , important for the club , ' said @entity0			1
' apart from winning in @entity45 , we must also now wait what happens about @entity20 because if they win against @entity1 , they will continue in the @entity4			1
' so it does n't depend on what we can do , but the only thing that we must do is to win			0
we must try to focus in our game			0
' to add to the intrigue , @entity1 have been enthusiastic backers of @entity56 's financial fair play regulations			2
city were heavily fined and forced to pick a reduced 21 - man @entity4 squad for this season for breaking @entity62 regulations in the past			2
there are various permutations that @entity8 will need to take into account on wednesday			2
if they are drawing 1 - 1 or 2 - 2 in @entity45 , the scoreline of the other game in @entity70 would dictate if @entity8 needed to score a winning goal to progress			2
guardiola on the touchline during his side 's 3 - 2 defeat at the @entity76 last month it ’s a minefield , although @entity8 can qualify with a victory or a high scoring draw in @entity45 unless @entity20 win in @entity70 , in which case the @entity80 would go through			1
@entity8 would go out with a 0 - 0 draw and there are many more permutations beyond those			2
even so , @entity0 – criticised last season for not seeming to realise a 4 - 2 win against @entity1 would help @entity8 top the group when he took off @entity89 in the closing stages as @entity8 led 3 - 2 – insists he has not deployed anyone in particular to keep him abreast of developments in the other group game			1
' i do n’t think that it is complicated this year			0
i do n't see where the complication is			0
we must win , we have nothing to think about , ' he said			0
' this team will not change			0
we will always be an offensive team , we will always try to go for the game from the beginning and we will do the same thing against @entity10			0
' we know if it is 0 - 0 that puts @entity10 in a better position than our team			0
if we draw 1 - 1 we are in a better position than @entity10 and both teams will depend on what happens with @entity20 against @entity1			1
my mind is absolutely clear			0
' while @entity0 waits to see if playmaker @entity113 is fit enough for his first action since being injured in a @entity116 tie against @entity117 , he is also aware of the danger of @entity10 's 38 - year - icon @entity119			1
@entity119 embarrassed @entity8 's twitter feed at the @entity76 by scoring @entity10 's goal in a 1 - 1 draw after they had highlighted before the game that he had n't got a goal on @entity126 soil			1
@entity0 , who was appointed after @entity127 had failed to get @entity8 past the group stages in @entity129 , said @entity130 remains a threat			2
' he is the same as @entity133 , ' said the @entity8 boss			0
' they have enough quality – maybe not to play three games in a week – but when they play they are very good			0
' @entity0 reached the @entity4 quarter - finals with unfancied @entity138 two seasons ago			2
last year , @entity8 crashed out at the last - 16 stage against @entity141 .			0

@entity0 reminds @entity7 of the importance of trust
@entity8 's @entity4 progress lies in @entity1 's hands
city need to win or earn goalscoring draw at @entity10 to progress
but neither result will matter if @entity1 lose at home to @entity20
