@entity1 officials are poised to start bulldozing the illegal migrant camps that have marred the town for more than a decade			1
yesterday it emerged that the @entity5 of @entity1 has issued an ultimatum to migrants telling them to remove their belongings and evacuate by the end of the month or be forcibly ejected by riot police			1
it comes as the mayor of the port town opened the first purpose built accommodation for migrants since the closure of the notorious @entity19 centre in 2002			1
@entity1 officials will begin bulldozing migrant camps around the port city at the end of this month following the opening of a new refugee centre ( file image ) the @entity25 ( pictured ) , currently houses 50 women and children and is preparing to house up to 20 more			1
the remaining 1,930 immigrants will be housed on wasteland next to it yesterday around 50 women and children became the first residents of the purpose - built @entity25 with plans to accommodate up to 20 more			0
men will not be allowed to sleep there but will be allowed access during the day to make use of the showers and cooking facilities			0
it is believed the @entity42 authorities plan to raze the illegal shanty town which has grown up around the town ’s ferry port next tuesday			1
the land is owned by a chemical company @entity47 who succeeded in securing an eviction notice on the migrants last summer			2
but since then the police have failed to move them on and the area has become blighted by rubbish and roughly improvised shelters causing fury among local @entity42 residents			1
it is estimated that there are around 2,000 men , women and children sleeping rough in the town hoping to cross the channel into the @entity65			2
@entity66 , the mayor of @entity1 , hopes the centre will allow authorities to get a grip on the situation which has plagued her town for months once cleared from their existing camps the migrants will be moved to an area of wasteland alongside the @entity78 site			1
the town mayor @entity66 hopes the measure will help the authorities to gain control over the town ’s chaotic migrant population and limit the influence of the people smugglers who exploit the desperation of those living in the filthy camps			1
but yesterday critics feared the move would only exacerbate the problem with charity workers predicting it would take the women given beds an average of three months to sneak into the @entity65			1
@entity96 from the charity @entity97 said : ‘ the length of stay at this centre is expected to vary a lot			0
‘ perhaps an average of three months for women without children before they manage to get to @entity106			2
’ @entity78 , which has been converted from a former children ’s holiday camp , will offer beds , food and hot showers to women and children on the basis that they are too ‘ vulnerable ’ to be sleeping rough			0
set in beautiful dune land next to massive @entity119 @entity118 bunkers and beaches which afford stunning views of the @entity122 and the @entity123 , the centre is half an hour ’s walk from the ferry terminal			0
in addition to the @entity78 centre another ‘ day ’ shelter was also opened yesterday			1
this will offer migrants showers and mobile phone chargers as well as serving 4,000 meals a day			2
but the @entity65 government has long argued that such measures will only increase the numbers of displaced people congregating in the area with the aim of getting onto lorries crossing to @entity140			0
during the six years that @entity19 was open , it acted as stepping stone to @entity65 for an estimated 18,000 illegal immigrants and remains a source of bad feeling between @entity65 and @entity42			0
conservative mp @entity146 , who sits on the @entity148 , told @entity149 : ‘ the @entity42 need to tackle illegal immigration themselves and not set up a camp convenient for for going to @entity106			0
the new centre has been dubbed @entity19 2 , named after a previous @entity154 centre ( pictured ) which housed migrants close to the @entity42 end of the @entity157 until it was destroyed in 2002 ‘ the @entity42 signed up to open borders and now they are failing to properly deal with the consequences			0
‘ there is a danger that this camp will turn into a new @entity19 , with all the problems that entailed			0
’ earlier this week mayor @entity66 , 52 , herself the daughter of eastern @entity167 migrants who settled in @entity42 , used a speech to @entity167 council to blame @entity65 for the lawlessness in @entity1			1
speaking on tuesday she said her town was ‘ suffering the consequences of the custodial role @entity65 has imposed on us to guard its frontier on our territory			0
’ relations between the neighbouring countries have steadily deteriorated over the last year over the problem of @entity1			1
last summer mass brawls between rival gangs left more than 70 people injured and has forced the @entity42 riot police to maintain an almost constant presence to keep the peace			0
in october home secretary @entity187 was forced to pledge £ 12million to tighten security in @entity1 after 250 immigrants stormed the ferry terminal hoping to make it across the @entity122			2
but last night regional prefect @entity192 denied this insisting the new shelters are ‘ humanitarian gestures			0
’ he said : ‘ neither of these centres are in any way new @entity19 - type hostels in @entity1			2

up to 2,000 migrants have been living in @entity1 shanty towns for months
authorities have opened new shelter and are moving to bulldoze camps
it is believed that officials will move on *temporary* shelters next tuesday
