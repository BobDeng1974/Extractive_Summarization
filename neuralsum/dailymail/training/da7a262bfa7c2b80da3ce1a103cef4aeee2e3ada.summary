the hdx models are four times faster at handling graphics			2
the new @entity102 has a magnesium alloy case but has the same processor as older @entity33 models the ' @entity29 ' feature lets users speak to a live customer service representative in a video window when downloading apps or using certain features ( pictured top right )			2
the helpers can troubleshoot problems while guiding users with on - screen hand scribbles ' you should n't have to be afraid of your device , ' mr @entity91 said			0
in a demo , mr @entity91 asked an on - screen customer service representative to recommend an app. the rep suggested @entity129 : @entity130 , while also giving instructions on how to set time limits on various activities for children			0
while the new kindles are upgraded in several ways , @entity0 also cut the price on what will be its entry - level , updated 7 - inch tablet , the @entity102 with @entity141 of memory now costing £ 119 in the @entity4			1
the new @entity102 has a magnesium alloy body , like the hdx models , but has the same screen resolution and processing power of the older models			2
@entity148 , a consumer technology analyst with research firm @entity150 , said the price cut to the @entity102 will do more to help @entity0 compete in the tablet market than the added features on the newer models			2
technology and science reporter @entity156 gives her verdict on the tablet : ' @entity17 's @entity159 has dominated the budget tablet market for some time , but @entity0 's new @entity33 range is a serious contender to challenge this			1
' the most immediately impressive feature - on both devices - is the high quality screen , which really has to be seen to be appreciated ' both screens are on par with the stunning clarity of @entity17 's latest @entity159 and even when compared to high - end hd screens , the colours are noticeably brighter			2
' during my brief hands - on with the two tablets , apps loaded immediately and switching between pages and applications was seamless			0
@entity0 claims the devices are three times faster than previous models but this could n't be qualified			1
' however , the quality of the screen combined with this speed did make watching video clips seem effortless			0
' i was a little cynical about how useful the @entity29 feature - which is a free 24/7 technical support team accessible from the tablet 's homescreen - would be , but during a demonstration i was impressed at not only how simple it is to use and how approachable the customer support member was , but the range of features available			2
' the helper can draw on the screen , show or tell users how to do things by taking them through various menus and explain more about the features			0
the feature can also be muted , or screen sharing can be disabled simply by asking			0
' other notable features i was briefly shown include the x-ray feature when watching @entity0 - bought titles			2
this is an @entity205 widget that sits to the left of the screen and shows details about the actors currently on screen			0
' viewers can also switch to bloopers and other significant scenes at the touch of a button from the @entity217 tab , plus buy related tracks			0
this latter feature was n't working when i used the device , but @entity0 claims it will be available from launch			0
' another feature that will appeal to parents is @entity224			0
this is an easy to setup feature designed especially for children that comes with parental controls pre-enabled			0
' the price of the 7 - inch tablet is aimed directly at @entity17 's latest tablet and for £ 199 there is a lot to get excited about			1
the £ 329 price for the 8.9 - inch device does seems a little steep though			1
' although i only used the devices briefly , i did n't think there was enough different about the larger model to warrant the extra £ 130 and it will mainly appeal to people who think the 7 - inch screen is just a little small			1
' having used and loved @entity17 's @entity159 , i 'd be torn between this and @entity0 's @entity33			1
yet @entity17 would win , at a push , because its operating system seems slicker and is pure @entity247 , rather than a skinned version			0
' ' that 's where that model needs to be priced , ' @entity148 said , explaining that there are numerous manufacturers with tablets with screens that measure seven inches diagonally , all priced around the same mark			0
' a big focus in that 7 - inch category is just price			1
' between may and july , @entity261 accounted for 17 per cent of all tablets sold in the @entity1 compared to 48 per cent for @entity23 's @entity14 and 8 per cent for @entity265 's @entity264 line , according to @entity150			2
globally , @entity0 's shipments between april and june were down 59 per cent from a year earlier , at 470,000			2
the tablets are available to pre-order from today and are said to be three times faster than the previous generation this is compared to 14.6 million for @entity23 's @entity14 , down 17 percent from a year ago , and 10.8 million for @entity265 's @entity264 line , up 539 per cent			1
@entity0 sells most of its kindles around the @entity274 holidays , @entity148 said			0
beyond the improved specifications , @entity0 also unveiled more features that incorporate data from its @entity205 movie database partner			0
with the newer tablets , users who turn on the ' x-ray ' feature can see a small window that lists the name of a song that is playing in some tv shows and movies			0
one tap brings up the option to buy the song			0
users can also look for all music in a show and zip to the exact spot where a particular song is playing			0
people who have set up @entity0 's video player as an app on their tvs or through game consoles can also follow along in real - time on their tablets , getting information on actors and trivia related to the shows on their larger screen			1
music lovers can see song lyrics when they play songs bought from @entity0 , lyrics are highlighted as they are sung and tapping on the lyrics will zip to the appropriate point in the song			0
@entity91 said these services are only possible because @entity0 provides the hardware , operating system , applications , cloud infrastructure and services for the devices			0
the ' hardest and coolest ' services such as its @entity29 service lie at the intersection of ' customer delight ' and ' deep integration through the entire stack , ' he added			0
@entity0 also unveiled new ' origami covers ' that lie flat when closed over the screen but can be folded and snapped into place as a stand that works both in horizontal and vertical position			0
they 'll come in seven different colours in the @entity1 for between $ 45 and $ 70			0
the 8.9 - inch @entity33 , pictured , starts at £ 329 for @entity332 memory			1
the 7 - inch model starts at £ 199 , also for @entity332			1
