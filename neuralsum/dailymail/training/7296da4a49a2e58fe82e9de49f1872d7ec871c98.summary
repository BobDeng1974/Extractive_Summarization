take a rusty old boat , a few smoke bombs and a rather anticlimactic sinking			0
put them together and , believe it or not , you have an art project that is judged to be worth £ 50,000 of taxpayers ’ money			1
artist @entity9 bought the 24ft @entity10 on @entity11 for £ 75			1
he lit smoke bombs to make it look as if it was on fire , then opened its valves , filling it with water			0
as it sank , he dived into the sea			0
and the point of this performance ? the boat had been fitted with underwater cameras , which will film for a year as it grows into an artificial reef off the @entity28 coast			1
footage will be sent to a phone app so people can watch live , and will later be made into a film			2
he set off smoke bombs to make it look like the vessel was on fire the @entity47 project will cost £ 120,000 , nearly half funded by the @entity48			1
the rest will come from @entity51 grants			0
mr @entity9 , 48 , the half - brother of singer @entity52 , said : ‘ a boat that was at the end of its life is now starting a new one			1
’ @entity47 was commissioned by @entity57 and @entity58 , groups supported by the @entity48			0
it cost £ 80,000 to sink the boat and consult marine experts , of which £ 32,000 came from the @entity48			1
an extra £ 40,000 will be spent on exhibitions in @entity65 and @entity66 , of which the @entity48 will pay half			2
the boat has been fitted with five underwater cameras which will record the 12 - month journey of the ‘ dead ’ boat being brought back to life in the form of an artificial reef for marine life			1
the footage will be streamed live and a film will eventually be made and shown at art exhibitions			1
but the project has been slammed by some after it emerged that nearly half of the £ 120,000 spent on the project has been funded by the @entity36 taxpayer through grants from the @entity48			1
it was commissioned by @entity57 and @entity58 , two arts organisations in @entity65 supported by the @entity88 remaining cost has come through @entity51 arts grants			0
@entity90 , chief executive of the @entity91 ’ @entity92 , said : ' taxpayers struggling with rising bills will be baffled that they ’ve been asked to pay to sink a boat in the name of art. ' if this project was worthwhile then private investment should have been sought			2
this sort of wasteful spending by unaccountable quangos and local authorities has to come to an end			0
' going under : the ship dips below the waves			0
five underwater cameras have been attached to the vessel to document the ' dead ' ship 's journey over the next year as it becomes an artificial reef for marine life the project , called @entity47 , has taken three years to come to fruition because of the level of planning and consultation from marine experts required			1
mr @entity9 , who is the half - brother of singer @entity52 , said : ' the idea was to take a boat and send her on a short journey to the bottom of the sea			1
' i bought the concrete hull of a disused boat on @entity11 then added a concrete wheelhouse so it replicated a working boat			1
we had very strict permissions and the boat was stripped of anything that could potentially be harmful			0
' i was on board the boat and we set up pyrotechnics to look like a fire so it looked like the boat was in trouble			0
' then i opened the seacocks and let water into the boat			0
as it went down i dived off to symbolise abandoning ship			0
he explained that the boat has been rigged with five cameras that transmitted the sinking and will continue to transmit live for the next year so people can see it transform into a reef			1
the cameras will broadcast to a mobile app for a year and the film will eventually be shown at exhibitions in @entity65 , @entity157 and @entity158 in @entity66			2
of the £ 120,000 that the project cost , £ 80,000 went into buying , building and towing the boat and consulting with marine experts			1
of that money , £ 32,000 was funded by the @entity48 with the rest being met by grants from @entity166 , a scheme funded by the @entity168 to encourage @entity170 projects to work together			2
a further £ 40,000 will be spent on exhibitions in @entity65 , @entity158 and @entity157 , half of which will be met by the @entity48 and half by @entity166			0
creative family : @entity9 , pictured left , is the half - brother of singer @entity52 , pictured right earlier this year			1
one of his recent art projects involved him walking through a burning plane @entity180 from @entity181 , one of the main backers of the project , added : ' eventually there will be an exhibition at @entity57 with an edited version of the film we took of the sinking			2
' @entity190 was an amazing success and a real relief after all the planning that has gone into it			0
it was a relatively expensive project because of all the experts involved in it			0
mr @entity9 ’s recent art projects have involved films of him walking through a burning plane and walking across the sea bed			2
he also sent a chair to the edge of space beneath a weather balloon in the name of art.			0

artist @entity9 bought a disused concrete boat on @entity11
he dramatically *scuttled* the vessel off the coast of @entity41 , @entity28
five cameras attached to the ship will record ' dead ' boat over the next year
film will be made of the vessel becoming an artificial reef for marine life
nearly half the £ 120,000 art project was funded by the taxpayer
