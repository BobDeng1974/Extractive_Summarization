hundreds of ' micro-pigs ' , made popular by celebrities such as @entity2 and @entity3 , have been shot by marksmen after running wild in a @entity7 wood			1
more than 300 of the tiny pigs were discovered by stunned farmers on common moorland in @entity11 , @entity12			1
it is believed that they broke free from captivity , before becoming ' out of control ' as they rampaged through the countryside and mated with normal pigs			1
a council official said that they had arranged for a slaughter - man to carry out a ' humane cull ' of 106 of the animals in the past week			1
a spokesman said : ' we made several inquiries to identify ownership of the animals but no - one came forward to accept responsibility for them			1
' these animals presented a serious risk to other livestock in the region in the event of a disease outbreak and because of this we were left with no option but to carry out a cull of these animals			1
' this was carried out by a licensed professional and with full support of local farmers in the area			0
' the animals , native to @entity57 , begin life no bigger than a tea cup			0
@entity60 heiress @entity3 ( pictured above ) also got in on the micro-pig trend a few years ago they became fashionable as celebrity pets - with @entity65 buying husband , @entity64 , two for @entity66 in 2009			1
@entity60 heiress @entity3 and @entity7 singer @entity67 were also seen with micro-pigs , leading to a surge in pet pigs around the country			2
however , their popularity soon waned , with many unwitting owners getting rid of the animals after discovering that they grow to five foot long and three foot tall			2
@entity76 , sister of catwalk model @entity77 , holds a micro-piglet up to the camera this has led to rescue centres becoming overwhelmed with unwanted micro-pigs			0
@entity84 from the @entity86 @entity85 blamed the situation on breeders cashing in on the rise of the popularity of the micro-pig as an urban pet			0
she said : ' owners buying these pigs on a whim were left taking on far more than they realised			2
' they bought them as cute piglets not realising or being told by breeders how big they would become			0
the popularity of the animals waned when people realised how big they grow to ( above , @entity101 ) ' they can be expensive to keep and they require up to half an acre of fenced in land or more to roam around in			2
' now that the fad for them has faded , rescue centres are loathe to take on even more of them			0
' and as sad as it is to hear that these pigs and piglets have been shot , it would have been worse for them to have been kept without welfare in mind			0
' there is also a risk of diseases such as foot and mouth or swine flu spreading if you have wild and uncontrolled pigs going through rubbish bins			0

more than 300 found running free on moorland in @entity11 , @entity12
it is believed that they escaped captivity before rampaging through the countryside and mating with normal pigs
sadly , no - one came forward to identify them so the council ordered the cull
spokesman said they had no choice as the micro-pigs posed risk of disease
the animals became popular as pets after *recent* celebrity micro-pig trend
but many owners did not realise how big they got and had to get rid of them
