he has appeared in court more than 100 times for alleged breaches of the order since it was first issued against him in 2007 , yet in all that time he has never been convicted			2

this week , during a civil case at @entity42 , sheriff @entity40 ruled mr @entity1 ’s human rights had been breached because the order had never been regularly reviewed , nor had it been made permanent			1

mr @entity1 has lodged a fresh complaint with @entity105			2
the force has also been ordered by the @entity107 to investigate allegations made by him that police officers have been involved in a ' criminal conspiracy ' by keeping the asbo in place for so long and attempting to secure breaches of it to justify its implementation			1
