by @entity1 reporter a new class of experimental medicines can dramatically lower cholesterol , raising hopes of a fresh option for people who ca n't tolerate or do n't get enough help from @entity9 and other statin drugs that have been used for this for decades			1
the first large studies of these drugs were presented saturday at an @entity15 conference in @entity16 , and more will follow on sunday			1
several companies are developing these drugs , which are aimed at 70 million @entity19 and millions more worldwide who have high ldl or ' bad ' cholesterol , a major risk for heart disease			1
a new class of experimental medicines can dramatically lower cholesterol , raising hopes of a fresh option for people who ca n't tolerate or do n't get enough help from @entity9 and other statin drugs that have been used for this for decades			1
the first large studies of these drugs were presented saturday at an @entity15 conference in @entity16 three studies of @entity34 's version of these drugs , called evolocumab ( ev - oh - @entity37 - you - mab ) , found it lowered ldl or ' bad ' cholesterol by 55 to 66 percent compared to a fake drug , and by nearly that much when compared to @entity44 's @entity43 , another cholesterol medication			1
as impressive as that is , it 's still just part of the picture			0
doctors want evidence that the way these drugs lower cholesterol also will lead to fewer heart attacks and deaths , because that proof already exists for statins			1
new studies are underway to test this , but @entity34 said it will seek approval for its drug this year based on cholesterol - lowering alone			1
that was enough to win approval for statins and @entity43 , but use of @entity43 has declined since 2008 , when research showed it failed to help prevent heart attacks even though it cut cholesterol			1
hopes are high that the new @entity34 drug and others like it will do better			0
' i would be happy to see it approved on the cholesterol results alone , ' said dr. @entity74 , a cardiologist at @entity75			2
' we need additional agents other than statins " to help patients , ' he said			0
nearly all current cholesterol medicines — fibrates , niacin and top - selling statins — are decades old			1
statins such as @entity9 , @entity85 and @entity86 curb cholesterol production			2
@entity43 , which came out about a decade ago , helps block the absorption of cholesterol from the intestine			2
the new drugs block @entity92 , a substance that interferes with the liver 's ability to remove cholesterol from the blood			1
they have big drawbacks , though			0
statins are pills sold as generics for as little as a dime a day			0
the new drugs are proteins rather than chemicals , and those tend to be very expensive to make			2
they also must be given as shots every two weeks or once a month			0
people can give the shots to themselves with a pen - like device			0
the companies developing the new medicines have not said what they might cost			2
' we were very , very pleased about how well patients accepted the shots , and if they offer better results , especially for those with inherited conditions - people will accept it , ' said dr. @entity120 of @entity121 in @entity122 , who helped lead two of the studies			2
the three @entity34 studies involved about 2,000 patients in all			0
doctors tested the drug in people with high cholesterol not taking other medicines , as a long - term ( one - year ) treatment in people already taking various medications and in combination with statins and other drugs in people with an inherited cholesterol disorder			1
in general , side - effect rates were about the same for evolocumab vs. placebo or @entity43			0
in some studies , muscle aches , nausea and a few other problems were a little higher with the experimental drug			0
overall safety ' is very , very encouraging , ' said dr. @entity148 , @entity34 's executive medical director			0
researchers also said : — @entity150 , a similar drug being developed by @entity152 and @entity153 , lowered ldl cholesterol by 47 percent vs. 16 percent for @entity43 in a study of about 100 people not taking any other drugs for high cholesterol			1
— @entity159 , from @entity160 , lowered ldl 45 percent to 67 percent , depending on dose , compared to placebo in 354 people with high cholesterol also taking a statin			0
' there 's great interest in all of these drugs , but doctors will wait for evidence that they lower heart risks , ' said dr. @entity173 , a @entity174 cardiologist and spokesman for the @entity176			1
it may be easier to justify their use in patients with genes that cause high cholesterol at an early age , he said			0
a spokeswoman for the federal @entity185 , @entity186 , suggested that might be the case			0
' although we can not comment on the likelihood of approval based solely on specific indications or populations , ' two drugs recently were approved based on cholesterol - lowering for people with inherited conditions , ' she noted			1
a decision on approval also will be influenced by how much the drug lowers cholesterol , its effects on other fats in the blood and other heart signs such as inflammation and blood pressure , and its safety , she said .			2
