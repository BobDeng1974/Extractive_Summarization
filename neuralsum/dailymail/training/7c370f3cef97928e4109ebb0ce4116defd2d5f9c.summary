by @entity0 - parkinson last updated at 11:34 am on 9th january 2012 @entity1 in @entity2 was crowded , but heavy discounts failed to bring an expected boost in spending spending on the @entity6 fell over @entity7 despite heavy discounts designed to entice us into parting with our cash			1
many sales started before @entity7 , but the amount we spent both in shops and online tumbled on a monthly and yearly basis			2
even the amount spent over the festive season on food , alcohol and tobacco fell by 5.3 per cent while spending on transport and communication also saw an annual decrease of 5.8 per cent			1
overall spending fell by 1.1 per cent month - on - month in december and by 0.8 per cent when compared with the same period in 2010			1
those behind the survey said the monthly drop reflected recent volatility as consumers become very cautious amid an uncertain economic backdrop			0
mail and telephone order spending saw a 3 per cent year - on - year decline , while face - to - face spending decreased by 1.4 per cent and online spending saw a more modest annual decline of 0.4 per cent			1
this is the first time in two - and - a - half years that a year - on - year decline has been recorded for all three of these methods			1
consumer spending has not recovered since a peak in 2007 , those behind the survey said			1
@entity46 ’s @entity45 uses spending on its cards as a base , but the figures are adjusted to reflect overall consumer spending , not just that on @entity46 cards			1
@entity53 , chief economist at @entity54 , which compiles the report , said : ' a 1.1 per cent drop in consumer spending in december caused expenditure to fall 0.9 per cent over the fourth quarter as a whole			1
' with the consumer accounting for approximately two thirds of all expenditure in the economy , the downturn clearly adds to worries that the @entity65 may be sliding back into recession			2
' the data also highlights the plight that retailers have suffered over the key @entity7 trading period , with even online sellers not immune to households ’ increasing reluctance to spend			0
' heavy discounts caused a rush at shops like this @entity77 on @entity78 , @entity2			0
but consumers are becoming more savvy and cautious about spending despite several sectors seeing a decline over the year , hotels and restaurants saw the biggest boost , with 12 per cent growth in spending , while the clothing and footwear sector recorded a 6.7 per cent rise			1
dr @entity91 , commercial director at @entity92 , said : ' against a backdrop of challenging economic circumstances , consumers ’ uncertainty translated into subdued @entity7 spending , despite heavy discounting both on the high street and online			2
' it is clear that consumers have become increasingly savvy and cautious about where they choose to spend			0
' share prices in @entity104 and @entity105 's fell this morning amid further evidence of subdued retail demand			1
@entity104 slipped 1.9p to 389p while @entity105 's shed 0.3p to 298.5p			1
they will report figures later this week with @entity104 expected to post one of its weakest @entity7 trading periods in several years			2
among the larger brands that reported slowdowns were @entity113 and @entity114 , underlining the fierce competition in both sectors			2
luxury car company @entity118 had a record year in 2011 , it was announced today			1
the @entity120 - based company sold 3,538 cars worldwide last year - 31 per cent more than in 2010 and more than the previous record year of 1978 when the figure was 3,347			1
@entity123 was the company 's biggest market last year , followed by the @entity126 and the @entity65 , where there was 30 per cent growth			1
the record sales follow the announcement last september that @entity118 intends to expand its manufacturing plant at @entity132 in @entity133			1
work on this will begin next month			0
' we had an outstanding year in 2011 and we should take a moment to reflect on this great @entity65 success story , ' said @entity118 chief executive @entity139			1
' our business is in excellent shape			0
' we are developing our dealer network , moving into new markets like @entity144 , expanding our manufacturing operation in @entity133 to meet global demand and have plans to develop our product range			0
' at the core of this extraordinary success is a dedicated , committed and , above all , passionate workforce			0
' @entity152 today confirmed it is close to landing ' certain assets ' of the ailing retailer @entity155			0
the company , whose largest shareholder @entity157 owns the outdoor brands @entity161 and @entity162 , has reportedly offered £ 20m for most of the @entity164 and @entity165 stores			0
however , it is not expected to want the company ’s warehouse and head office			0
@entity152 confirmed it is in advanced discussions over an offer for certain assets and said a further announcement would be made on conclusion of the talks			0
it also said it would retain many of @entity164 ’ 3,500 staff			0
the deal is likely to be as part of a pre-pack administration , when a company emerges under new ownership following a pre-arranged sale			0
the process is viewed as controversial because creditors do not have the opportunity to vote against the proposed asset sale			0
@entity152 is thought to have beaten @entity187 ’ den star @entity188 , rival @entity189 , which is owned by @entity191 owner @entity190 , and outdoor retailer @entity192 to land the stores			0
@entity195 - based @entity152 currently has around 350 @entity152 outlets in the @entity65			2
the supermarket reported a slowdown in sales with like - for - like sales excluding vat and fuel increase 0.7 per cent in the seeks weeks to january 1			1
that compares with 2.4 per cent in the previous quarter and is lower than the @entity205 's expected growth of one per cent			2
the slowdown came despite @entity113 , the fourth biggest supermarket in the @entity65 , claiming a record number of customers , with an extra 800,000 per week shopping there during the period			0
the battle for sales gathered pace in early october when @entity104 introduced its @entity215 , prompting @entity105 ’s to launch a price - matching scheme and @entity217 to slash petrol prices			1
@entity114 , which owns 252 stores in the @entity65 , said its plans to shift focus to technology products , by refitting stores with an extended gadget range , saw group like - for - like sales fall 8.1 per cent in the five weeks to december 31			1
but in the 144 stores refitted with an increased range of portable digital products , like - for - like technology sales were up 51 per cent			1
@entity113 reported a slow - down in pre-christmas sales showing the fierce competition in the supermarket sector @entity114 has increased its range of portable digital products to mitigate for falls in music sales @entity114 , which recently sold bookseller @entity239 ’s and announced plans to sell its live music division , repeated its warning that there were ' material uncertainties ' which may cast doubt on the group ’s ability to continue			1
@entity248 , a retail analyst at @entity250 stockbrokers , said the update was marginally better than expected			0
an @entity255 retail group is poised to buy part of high street lingerie chain @entity257 , its owner said today			0
@entity259 , which owns stakes in a number of @entity65 retailers including @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity265 , is in advanced talks to buy part of the business - understood to be 60 stores - as part of a pre-pack administration deal			2
around 80 shops remain under threat of closure after @entity257 , which is owned by private equity firm @entity275 , announced its intention before @entity7 to appoint an administrator , which is now expected to be @entity278			0
as well as tough trading conditions , the chain has been weighed down by leases agreed by sister lingerie chain @entity282 with which it merged in 2007			2
a spokeswoman for @entity275 said : ' we can confirm that @entity259 , a leading international retail franchise operator , is in advanced discussions with @entity257 regarding a potential acquisition of part of the @entity65 @entity257 business			0
' @entity292 , @entity293 star and former owner of @entity257 , disclosed the pending deal on his @entity297 feed over the weekend			0
he said : ' good news and bad news re @ @entity300 heard that @entity275 has done a deal to sell the business with about 60 shops to @entity304			0
' he added : ' the bad news re @ lasenza is that the other 80 shops will be closed down or put in the hands of @entity278 with resulting job @entity309 ! ' but chief executive @entity311 added : ' undoubtedly trading conditions and the consumer environment remain challenging , but we remain confident in @entity114 ’s future prospects			2
' he added : ' it is encouraging that the @entity319 business has seen an improvement in trading although the like - for - like sales were still negative			2
' we remain concerned , however , that net debt levels are high at £ 160 million following the disposal of @entity239 ’s and @entity325			0

the group previously announced the closure of up to 40 stores in a bid to make millions of pounds of cost savings , with 15 shut in the first half of the year			2
meanwhile , the sale of @entity239 ’s and @entity325 raised the group £ 55 million and ensured a £ 220 million refinancing deal with its lending banks			0
@entity114 was the first of many retailers to report this week on their performance over the @entity7 break with @entity364 , @entity367 owner @entity365 , chocolatier @entity368 and supermarkets @entity104 and @entity105 all publishing updates .			1
