a respected @entity1 researcher has been found guilty of first - degree murder by handing his wife a drink to boost her fertility - after lacing it with cyanide			1
dr @entity8 told his lab assistant to purchase ' the purest ' cyanide on his corporate credit card overnight on april 15 , 2013			1
two days later , he prepared a drink of fertility booster @entity13 for his wife , 41 - year - old neurologist dr @entity15 , who was desperate for a second child			1
by april 20 , she was dead			0
on friday , despite a lengthy legal battle in which he tried to claim @entity18 died of natural causes , @entity8 hung his head as prosecutors branded him a ' master manipulator ' and the jury delivered a guilty verdict			1
it came after his near - perfect murder unraveled as police obtained evidence he searched cyanide poisoning on @entity30			2
his story also changed - from claiming he was upstairs when @entity18 drank the poison , to insisting he was downstairs			2
guilty : dr @entity8 has been found guilty of first - degree murder by poisoning his wife @entity15 prosecutors said @entity8 concocted the plan to kill his wife after she pressured him to have a second child and because he may have feared she was having an affair or planned to divorce him			1
the jury deliberated for 15 hours over two days before agreeing with @entity42 prosecutors that @entity18 had been murdered			1
it means he now faces a mandatory life sentence			0
@entity18 's relatives burst into tears upon hearing the guilty verdict			2
' @entity48 , ' said her mother , @entity49 , of @entity51 , @entity52 , outside the courtroom later			0
the 66 - year - old @entity8 denied poisoning his wife , insisting she died of natural causes			1
however , he changed his story a number of times and was found to have searched ways to cure cyanide poisoning online			2
his lawyers made the case that she might not have been poisoned at all , citing three defense experts who said that could n't be conclusively proved			0
' at a minimum we established very clear reasonable doubt , ' defense attorney @entity65 said , referring primarily to testimony from celebrity pathologist dr @entity70 , who said he could n't determine how @entity18 died because he thought a test that showed cyanide in her blood was unreliable			1
' master manipulator ' : prosecutors said @entity8 has spent a year constructing his cover - up story motives ? the jury heard @entity18 ( right ) wanted a second child and @entity8 ( left ) feared she might leave him @entity8 said the cyanide he bought was for stem cell experiments he was conducting on @entity85 's disease , because the toxin can be used to kill of neurological cells and thus simulate the disease in the lab. the key to the prosecution 's case was a test on @entity18 's blood that revealed a lethal level of cyanide			1
the blood was drawn while doctors at @entity99 tried in vain for three days to save her life , though the results were n't known until after she died and her body was cremated			0
' justice for @entity107 ! ' : @entity18 's relatives wept and embraced as the guilty verdict was delivered jurors said they found the lab test showing the lethal level of cyanide in @entity18 's blood to be the most reliable test in evidence			1
they also said @entity8 's decision to testify may have been a mistake			0
police said @entity8 told them he was downstairs in the kitchen and gave his wife a creatine drink before she collapsed , but on the witness stand @entity8 said he was upstairs when she got home , he did n't know if she drank anything and she collapsed after giving him a kiss on the cheek			1
the jurors said that @entity8 changing his story about where he was and what happened in his wife 's final moments led them to believe he was lying			2
' i think he had incredible coaches , ' juror @entity133 said			0
' i think he had a year to think about what story he wanted to tell			0
' jurors also were moved by a recording of a 911 call @entity8 made while his wife was groaning , moaning and gasping for air in the background			2
@entity143 said she was ' horrified ' by @entity18 's suffering , while fellow juror @entity146 said , ' it got you in the gut			0
it got you in the heart			0
' @entity8 did online searches on cyanide poisoning and how it might be removed by the medical treatments @entity18 received or detected by a coroner after her death			1
he said that the queries were related to his research and that the other searches were made simply as he tried to understand the treatment his wife received			0
the life sentence is mandatory in any first - degree murder case			0
prosecutors declined to pursue the death penalty because they said they found no aggravating circumstances that would have made it a capital offense .			0
