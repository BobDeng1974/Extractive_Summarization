as he hugs his newborn son in a £ 40,000 bespoke nursery , @entity0 has realised his dream of becoming a father for the first time			1
he gazes at his civil partner @entity7 , then they turn to the child ’s surrogate mother , @entity8 , and say : ‘ thank you for giving us the baby we ’ve always dreamed of			1
’ @entity13 , nicknamed ‘ little master @entity15 ’ by the couple , was born naturally at 11.01pm on january 14 after a 16 - hour induced labour , weighing 7lb 15oz			1
biologically , 41 - year - old mr @entity0 is the father and @entity8 – no relation to @entity7 – used her own eggs , as a traditional surrogate			1
but @entity8 is n’t the only woman to be giving birth for the gay couple , who live in an £ 800,000 four - bedroomed home in @entity25			1
all three became pregnant within weeks of each other – meaning that two more babies are on the way			0
the second , a girl , who is biologically mr @entity7 ’s child , is due to be born on february 23 to first - time surrogate @entity28 from @entity41 , @entity42			1
a third baby , a boy , who also is biologically mr @entity0 ’s , is due on july 14 to @entity8 ’s sister - in - law @entity29 – who , remarkably , is also @entity28 ’s neighbour			1
last night it consultant mr @entity7 , 50 , said : ‘ we are overwhelmed and overjoyed that we ’ve become dads as we ’ve longed for a family for more than a decade			1
it ’s something we never thought would be possible			0
‘ yes , our family is unconventional , but just because we are gay should n’t preclude us from becoming parents			1
our home is a loving , nurturing environment and between us we have three sisters and our parents so there will be plenty of positive female role models for our children as they grow up			1
i suppose you could say we are a very modern family			2
’ mr @entity0 , a dentist , and mr @entity7 met on the internet in january 1999 and moved in together that year			1
in 2012 they became civil partners			0
they had often talked about wanting children and originally intended to try to adopt. but after reading about sir @entity68 and his partner @entity69 becoming parents to a boy through surrogacy in 2010 , they decided to follow his example			1
the mothers were introduced to the gay couple after they joined several surrogacy websites and forums			1
initially , they chatted for 12 months to @entity29 , 27 , from @entity42			0
the happy couple mr @entity7 and mr @entity0 controversially enlisted the help of not one but three surrogates because she was already helping a couple , she introduced them to her former sister - in - law @entity8 , 32 , who had been a surrogate once before			1
six weeks later , when she knew they longed for a family , @entity8 told them that her best friend @entity28 , 32 , was looking to become a first - time surrogate			1
after four months of meetings , both women agreed to become their surrogate mothers			1
in an even more bizarre twist , @entity29 also came back to the dads and offered to make it a hat - trick for them – and a world first for surrogacy			1
each of the women is a traditional surrogate , meaning they use their own eggs – so while babies one and three will be half brothers , baby two will not be genetically linked to them			2
surrogate mother @entity8 holds baby boy @entity15 after the birth last month mr @entity7 said : ‘ we never set out to become a world first , we just wanted children of our own			1
but because @entity8 and @entity29 are former sisters - in - law they are really close and they both used to live on the same street as @entity28 , so it ’s like we are a huge extended family			1
‘ they ’ve been nicknamed the “ twiplets ” as they will all go to school at the same time together			0
after sitting down and talking it through we knew in our hearts that we could n’t turn down the chance to have the family we ’d always dreamed of			2
’ for the birth , @entity8 ’s mother @entity123 drove her to the @entity126 hospital and they met mr @entity7 and mr @entity0 at the entrance			1
@entity8 said : ‘ i spent hour after hour in the early stages of labour , which was exhausting			0
then i started to feel a lot of pressure and i knew the baby was on its way			0
i just started breathing deeply and focusing on the job in hand but the pain was awful			0
‘ as soon as i was taken into the delivery suite my mum @entity123 , who is known as “ mamma stork ” as she ’s my and the two other surrogates ’ birthing partner , and the dads encouraged me			0
‘ @entity0 held my hand throughout the whole thing			1
i had my eyes shut tight as the pain was so intense			0
it was too late to give me an epidural so i had to do it with gas and air alone			2
‘ there was a lot of commotion and i started crying with the joy of it all			0
‘ @entity0 cut the cord and the baby was handed straight to @entity7 for skin on skin [ contact ]			1
it was a beautiful moment			0
i just felt so elated i ’d done this for them and had given them the son they ’d always dreamed of			0
’ mr @entity0 said : ‘ during the birth we could see his little heart racing so we were worried about him			1
then , when he popped out , he was so delightful			0
ten perfect little fingers and toes and a pretty good pair of lungs			0
‘ as soon as he was in @entity7 ’s arms he stared up at him and immediately became calm			2
it was so overwhelming i could n’t hold back my tears			0
i felt a rush of love for my son			0
he grimaced a bit but he was delightful			0
it was a beautiful , wonderful moment to hold our child in our arms			2
’ birth : @entity8 was introduced to the gay couple after they joined several surrogacy websites and forums all three women became pregnant within weeks of each other – meaning that two more babies are on the way within hours of the birth mr @entity0 gave @entity8 a ‘ push present ’ – a £ 200 @entity200 crystal necklace , saying : ‘ this is from @entity7 and i to thank you			1
’ in law , surrogates are not allowed to be paid but can claim expenses up to £ 15,000			2
mr @entity7 said : ‘ surrogates always seem to say they do n’t form a bond and have no difficulty when the moment comes to hand them over , but we found it hard to say goodbye			2
‘ @entity8 obviously feels love for this little mite even though she knows he ’s our little boy – she ’d even chosen his name , telling us , “ as you ’re gay you need something really out there ”			2
‘ but she and our other surrogate mums are going to be very much a part of our babies ’ lives			2
we are constantly visiting each other and that ’s going to continue			0
’ @entity8 , who has spent two weekends with @entity13 and the dads since the birth , said : ‘ as i handed him over to say goodbye i just felt physically empty as he was n’t in my stomach keeping me warm any more			2
i ’d carried him for nine months for @entity7 and @entity0 and i never lost sight of that and i did it as i knew they ’d make wonderful dads			1
‘ over the past three weeks my initial maternal instinct has cooled			0
now when i look at @entity13 i think of him as being my nephew			0
he does n’t feel like my child at all			2
i had nine months to reconcile in my mind that he is n’t mine			0
’ once @entity13 is six weeks old , mr @entity0 and mr @entity7 will apply for a @entity237 through the @entity238 which will give them joint custody the dads and @entity8 all went together to register the birth and mr @entity0 and @entity8 ’s names are on the birth certificate			1
once @entity13 is six weeks old , mr @entity0 and mr @entity7 will apply for a @entity237 through the @entity238 which will give them joint custody			1
once signed , the order means @entity8 will have no legal responsibility over @entity13 and the dads can apply , if they choose , for a new birth certificate to be issued			2
they have n’t decided if they will do that yet			0
for now mr @entity7 , a computer programmer and the son of a journalist father and book keeper mother , and mr @entity0 are ‘ exhausted ’ but enjoying every part of fatherhood			1
they have spent thousands in preparation , including the loft extension , painted in @entity263 and @entity265 paint with @entity267 - themed blinds featuring the characters from @entity269 and @entity270			2
hand - painted elephants decorate the walls			0
their @entity275 car has been replaced by a £ 20,000 @entity277 people carrier , a custom hand - built wardrobe is half full of blue clothes and half of pink for the impending arrivals , and a £ 700 @entity285 buggy stands in the hall – for now , the dads prefer to use their £ 100 @entity288 sling			0
they continue to work part time , with one dad staying at home on the days the other works			0
mr @entity0 ’s parents are going to live with them for the next six months to be on hand while they get the babies into a routine			2
mr @entity7 said : ‘ @entity13 is up three times in the night normally and whoever is n’t working the next day does the night - time feeds			1
he has just slotted into our relationship , he ’s another piece in the jigsaw			0
we were two and now we are three and it feels so natural			0
‘ our neighbours have all been over to meet him , and while they are all interested in surrogacy , they have all given us incredible support			0
’ and for now @entity8 is delighted to be very much a part of their lives .			0
