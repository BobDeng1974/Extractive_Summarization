by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:07 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 11:55 est , 25 october 2012 the transsexual wife killer who was granted a state - funded sex change may also be provided with electrolysis hair removal at the cost of the taxpayer			1
a judge ruled that @entity8 , 63 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , who was born @entity11 , should have an expert opinion to decide if the procedure is medically necessary			1
electrolysis is a beauty treatment carried out at many salons , where body hair is permanently removed by applying heat to the follicle through a small probe			0
most male - to - female transsexuals need electrolysis treatment to remove facial hair while they are undergoing their gender change			2
@entity11 has already received hormone treatments , psychotherapy and electrolysis previously while serving a life sentence as a woman in an all - male prison			1
federal judge @entity39 decided last month that the killer is entitled to be reimbursed by the state for years of legal bills because the state prisons department violated @entity11 's rights by refusing to pay for a sex change			1
the state is appealing that decision			0
in a hearing set for november 19 , a state prison doctor will testify that @entity11 does not need the treatment after already testifying to the same assessment two years ago			1
in 2002 , @entity39 ruled that @entity11 was entitled to treatment for gender - identity disorder , but stopped short of ordering surgery			1
@entity11 sued again in 2005 , arguing that the surgery is a medical necessity			1
' the court finds that there is no less intrusive means to correct the prolonged violation of @entity11 's @entity61 right to adequate medical care , ' @entity39 wrote in his 126 - page ruling			1
prison officials have repeatedly cited security concerns in the case , saying that allowing her to have the surgery would make her a target for sexual assaults by other inmates			2
but @entity39 found that the @entity26 's security concerns are ' either pretextual or can be dealt with by the @entity26 ' convicted : @entity11 was convicted of murder in the killing of his wife in 1990			1
he is pictured on may 24 , 1990 , being led to the county jail following his arraignment on drunken driving charges , in @entity79 , @entity80 black out : @entity11 has said that he did not remember killing his wife @entity81 the 63 - year - old legally changed his name to @entity8 nearly 20 years ago and has been living and dressing as a woman at the all - male @entity87 - @entity86 state prison			1
he has tried to kill himself twice and also threatened to castrate himself because he is so distressed over his gender identity			0
@entity39 said the sex change was a ' serious medical need '			1
according to research by psychiatry professor @entity92 at @entity93 , 27,000 people nationwide have gender identity disorder			0
experts estimate 500 to 750 @entity97 undergo the surgery each year , with hundreds more seeking the procedure abroad			0
federal courts have said prisons must provide adequate medical care , and that they must protect inmates from themselves			0
but correctional officials and lawmakers balk at using taxpayer money for sex - change operations that can cost up to $ 20,000			1
@entity92 estimates that at least 750 of the more than 2 million prisoners nationwide had gender identity disorder in 2007 , his latest count			0
@entity11 was convicted of first - degree murder in the killing of his wife , @entity81 , in 1990			1
@entity114 was found dead in the back seat of her car in a shopping mall parking lot on sunday , may 20 , 1990			0
markings showed she had been strangled with a rope and a wire and a taxicab driver testified in court that he had picked up @entity11 from that very mall in the afternoon and driven him home			2
a few hours later , @entity11 called police to report his wife missing , suggesting that she might have gotten into a car accident			1
police picked him up at his @entity9 home and questioned him , telling him that ' a body was found in the back seat ' of @entity81 's abandoned vehicle			2
@entity11 said his wife was at work all day and had intended to stop by the mall afterwards and that he was busy at the couple 's home all day			1
@entity136 , @entity81 's 15 - year - old son who lived with the couple , said that he called home for a ride around 5 pm and no one answered the phone			2
@entity11 was questioned again , only this time he left half way through the interview and said he was getting an attorney			2
two days later , @entity11 was involved in a car crash at midnight			2
officers found him in the driver 's seat dressed in women 's clothing and sent him home			0
on may 24 , 1990 , @entity11 was stopped for speeding in @entity79 , @entity151 , and arrested him for drunk driving			1
' you would be drunk too if the police thought you killed your wife , ' he said			0
later , at the police station , the defendant stated , ' look , i had a fifteen - year - old son and a wife			0
i ca n't call my wife			0
now , i need to call a psychiatrist now			0
' he later admitted to a reporter that he and his wife got into a heated argument during the day and she had thrown boiling water in his face			0
he picked up a wire and blacked out , waking up days later in the hospital			0
' apparently , i did take her life , ' he told the reporter			0
' it was probably in self - defense			0
' change : @entity11 first sued the @entity177 12 years ago after he was indicted for the crime , he began the transition from male to female and legally changed his name to @entity8			1
@entity11 's lawsuit has become fodder for radio talk shows and lawmakers who say the state should not be forced to pay for a convicted murderer 's sex - change operation – which can cost up to $ 20,000 – especially since many insurance companies reject the surgery as elective			1
@entity39 noted that @entity11 's gender - identity disorder has caused @entity11 such anguish that she has tried to castrate herself and twice tried to commit suicide , including once while on @entity197			2
@entity11 's lead attorney , @entity198 , called the decision courageous and thoughtful			2
' we feel very grateful that the judge listened very carefully to the medical experts and has given @entity11 what the prison doctors had recommended , ' @entity198 said			1
inmates in @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 have sued unsuccessfully to try to get the surgery , making similar arguments that denying it violates the @entity97 @entity213 's protection against cruel and unusual punishment			2
' this is not a choice			0
transsexuals are born and not made , ' said psychiatry professor @entity92 at @entity93			0
' if you did n't have this condition , why would you want to have your genitals removed , if not by a competent surgeon but by your own hand ? ' watch a legal discussion of the @entity11 case from before the verdict was announced :			0

@entity11 was convicted of murdering wife @entity81 in 1990
changed name to @entity8 in prison and sued state to pay for sex change
@entity10 judge ruled $ 20,000 surgery is the ' only adequate treatment '
