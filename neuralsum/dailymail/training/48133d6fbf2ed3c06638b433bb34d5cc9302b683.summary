if you spotted an orange - coloured ' star ' on tuesday night , then you were probably looking at @entity2			1
in fact , the event you witnessed was rare - for the first time in 778 days , @entity2 , @entity6 and the sun aligned in an ' opposition of the planets			1
' to scientists this is a unique but ultimately meaningless arrangement , but to a @entity14 minority , it marks the the beginning of significant events - even the second coming of @entity17			2
the unusual alignment of the sun , @entity6 and @entity2 happened a week before the beginning of the astrological event that some believe is associated with the @entity23 the significance of the arrangement is that it happened exactly a week before the first of four dark red ' blood moons , ' which some @entity27 believe marks a cycle associated with the @entity23			1
@entity30 , a @entity14 pastor who has written a book on the @entity32 called ' @entity33 : something is about to @entity35 ' told the @entity36 that tuesday night marked the dawn of a ' hugely significant event ' for the world			1
' this is not something that some religious think tank has put together , ' the notoriously outspoken church founder said			0
' @entity44 has confirmed that the @entity32 has only happened three times in more than 500 years — and that it 's going to happen now			1
' also known as the ' @entity32 ' , since it involves four successive total ' blood - red ' lunar eclipses each followed by six full moons , @entity44 has confirmed it started tuesday night and will end on september 28 , 2015			1
in the 21st century , tetrads are a frequent occurrence , with nine sets in total , but this has not always been the case			0
from 1600 to 1900 , for example , there were none at all			0
the ' @entity32 , ' cycle began in april last year			2
it involves a series of four dark red ' blood moons			1
' at the end of the cycle in september 2015 , some believe the end of the world will happen the @entity66 in the @entity67 prophesied about the blood moons and the @entity23 : ' the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the @entity73 comes			1
' according to mr @entity30 , each time the @entity32 has happened during that time , there has been a significant religious event accompanied with it			1
in 1493 , the first @entity32 saw the expulsion of @entity77 by the @entity78			2
the second happened in 1949 , right after the @entity80 was founded			0
and the most recent one , in 1967 , happened during the @entity82 between @entity83 and @entity80			0
this graphic explains why @entity2 was so visible to the naked eye on tuesday night mr @entity30 said the the first of the blood moons will happen on april 15 , right in the middle of the @entity77 holiday of @entity90			1
the second , on october 8 , occurs during the feast of the @entity93			0
the third will be on april 4 , 2015 , also during @entity90			0
the final one happens on september 28 , 2015 , also during the @entity96			2
a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of @entity6			2
this is an area known as the umbra , where light from the @entity103 is blocked by our planet			0
the light refracts differently in the atmosphere and , as it hits the moon , it makes it appear red			0
this gives rise to its ‘ blood red ’ appearance during a total eclipse , when the entire moon is in shadow			0
if it skirts the shadow , known as a partial or penumbral eclipse , the effect is less dramatic .			0

next week begins the start of the ' @entity32 , ' a series of lunar eclipses
the four ' blood - red ' moons are followed by six full moons
the cycle finishes at the end of september 2015
it *coincides* with an alignment of @entity6 , @entity2 and the sun
the chance alignment has only happened three times in the last 500 years
some @entity27 believe the @entity32 , is a signal the end of the world is near
tetrads are associated with significant religious events
