pc @entity4 , 35 , was intimidated by a senior officer who spied on her through @entity20 after she called in sick , an employment tribunal found this week			1
the case revealed that a detective sergeant looking into her complaint was told to delete references to discrimination and harassment from an internal report			2
ms @entity4 's lawyer , @entity29 , has now claimed that deleting findings of discrimination was ' a policy ' within the @entity7 so that they could avoid having to investigate their officers			1
she told the @entity36 : ' we anticipate that wherever there 's findings of discrimination they are being instructed to delete them			2
' mayor of london @entity41 today said he is ' dismayed ' by the tribunal 's findings and has agreed to review previous complaints within the @entity7 police to see if other reports were altered			1
@entity47 was thrust into the spotlight in 2012 when the @entity7 chose her to be a poster girl for a magazine feature on the 10,000 men and women on duty during the @entity55			1
but a tribunal ruled the elite @entity5 officer was unfairly treated by her inspector who singled her out from colleagues			2
when the @entity7 found out she had brought an employment tribunal , all references to discrimination and harassment were removed from the document			1
the tribunal found this was done ' not because they were not supported by evidence in the report , but because the claimant had brought a complaint of race and sex discrimination in the tribunal '			2
ms @entity29 , of law firm @entity74 , called for a full public inquiry into how the @entity7 handles race discrimination claims			1

' my client was subjected to discriminatory treatment because she is black and because she is a woman , ' she said			2
' fifteen years after the @entity7 was branded " institutionally racist " they have failed in addressing discrimination which pervades the system			1
the tribunal ruled that miss @entity4 's supervisor , acting inspector @entity95 , showed a ' personal hostility or antipathy ' towards her and worked to ' undermine , discredit and belittle her '			1
it found that within weeks of becoming her boss he formed the view that she was ' dishonest ' and not up to the standard of her colleagues ' without any sound basis			0
' and his ' negative perception ' was linked to her race and gender and ' no credible explanation ' was provided for singling her out			0
in one incident , a police car was sent to her home after she reported in sick for one day and her @entity20 was monitored to check the reason for her absence			0
and a request by @entity47 to move away from the unit to escape her bullying inspector was blocked by him			0
at the hearing the @entity7 agreed that the inspector behaved ' unreasonably ' but said his actions were down to a lack of experience and his ' robust and overzealous management style '			1
' this case shows that there needs to be a complete re-write of the @entity7 's equality procedures and an independent investigation into existing measures purporting to deal with discrimination complaints			1
' that 's the only way to protect officers facing similar discrimination in the future			0
' pc @entity47 is now line for substantial compensation and costs after an employment tribunal upheld her claims of racial and sexual discrimination			1

commenting on the case , @entity155 said : ' what is particularly shocking is the deliberate attempt to cover up internal findings of discrimination			1
' the outcome of the internal grievance investigation led @entity163 to believe that the investigating officer did not accept that there had been either race or sex discrimination , when clearly this was not the case			0
' @entity47 , who continues to serve with the @entity7 , is one of just two black women among 700 officers in @entity5			1
in its judgment , the tribunal found : ' she was treated the way she was because she was black and because she was a woman			2
