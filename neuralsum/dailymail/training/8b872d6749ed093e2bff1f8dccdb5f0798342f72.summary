treasury minister @entity0 vowed to end the revolving door of highly - paid administrators handed golden goodbyes worth thousands of pounds before walking straight into another role redundancy payouts given to @entity7 managers are to be clawed back if workers get a new job in the health service			1
the @entity11 vowed to end the revolving door of highly - paid administrators handed golden goodbyes worth thousands of pounds before walking straight into another role			1
but the move was dismissed as ‘ too little , too late ’ after 4,000 have already been rehired and it emerged staff will be able to keep the cash if they wait for a year before taking up a new post			2
under new rules announced by the @entity11 , the law will be changed so that anyone earning more than £ 100,000 who returns to the same part of public sector within 12 months of taking redundancy will have to return all or part of their pay - off			1
it is expected the measure - which is included in the @entity32 currently going through @entity33 - will mainly affect @entity7 and local government administrators			2
the @entity11 said that of the 19,000 @entity7 administrators made redundant between 2010 and 2013 , almost 20 per cent rejoined the @entity7 while 16 per cent of local government chief executives who left by mutual agreement between 2007 and 2009 had been employed by another council within a year			2
in march it emerged that almost 4,000 @entity7 staff given redundancy pay - offs as part of the coalition ’s health shake - up had been rehired			1
more than one in six managers and administrators given payouts worth as much as £ 650,000 were back working in the health service			1
@entity48 mp , @entity49 ’s shadow chief secretary to @entity11 , said the proposed legislation was only coming after the @entity51 had spent four years squandering large sums on the pay - offs despite promising a crackdown			2
he said : ‘ ministers could have acted on this years ago before they wasted millions of pounds firing and then rehiring staff			0
‘ in the @entity7 alone , the government ’s reckless reorganisation has seen £ 1.6 billion spent on redundancies			0
‘ over 4,000 @entity7 managers - some of whom received pay - offs over £ 200,000 - have been fired and rehired under this government			1
’ the new regulations will be included in the @entity32 currently going through @entity33			0
almost all of the public sector will be covered by the measures , including the @entity69 , local government and the @entity7			0
@entity71 chief secretary to the treasury @entity0 said : ‘ it ’s only fair that highly - paid executives who receive a redundancy pay - out from the public purse and then quickly return to the same part of the public sector repay the taxpayer			1
‘ reforming the public sector so it works for @entity81 has been a key part of this government ’s drive to create a stronger economy and fairer society			0
” the total cost to the @entity7 of ‘ revolving door ’ payments has not been revealed but with the average redundancy payment being £ 48,000 , it could mean almost £ 200million has been squandered on pay - offs for returning staff since 2010			1
family affair : @entity95 and husband @entity94 received six - figure pay - offs from @entity7 trusts but both got jobs at @entity100 non-clinical staff have received average pay - offs of £ 43,000 but 2,300 received six - figure deals			2
they include a husband - and - wife team of @entity7 managers who walked away with £ 1million in combined redundancies straight into six - figure salary posts			0
@entity95 , 50 , pocketed more than £ 605,000 when @entity108 of @entity109 , where she was chief executive , was wound up at the end of march 2013			0
her husband @entity94 , chief executive of @entity112 of @entity109 , was paid more than £ 345,000 when his organisation was abolished			0
by june last year both had board - level jobs at @entity100 – mr @entity94 as interim chief executive , miss @entity95 as recovery director .			0

law to be changed to take back redundancy payments if workers return
at least 4,000 *people* sacked in @entity7 shake - up have been rehired elsewhere
ministers vow to end the well - paid revolving door in the health service
but @entity49 says the changes are ' too little , too late ' after payouts made
