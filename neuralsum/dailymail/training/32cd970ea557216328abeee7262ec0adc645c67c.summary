by @entity0 call for action : fast response officers want to be moved from the top floor of @entity4 in @entity5 - because they keep injuring themselves running down three flights on stairs a team of fast response officers want to be moved from the top floor of a @entity12 police station – because they keep injuring themselves when running down three flights of slippery stairs			1
in what has been compared to a @entity18 comedy sketch , three constables have suffered serious injuries in the past year alone trying to get down the old @entity21 tiled staircases			1
officers at @entity4 in @entity5 claim they have to race down three flights of stairs covered in glazed tiles each time they answer an emergency call			1
one constable , who is part of the 30 - strong response team , said that his colleagues now lose vital minutes by having to walk slowly down the stairs to avoid injury			0
the officer , who did not want to be named , said : ‘ there is a @entity18 element to it with officers tumbling down a flight of steps and injuring themselves before they ’ve even got out of the building			2
‘ but on a serious note it ’s a real health hazard			0
‘ it ’s daft to have a fast response team located on the top floor of an old @entity21 building which has no lifts , just a shabby staircase which is covered in shiny old glazed tiles			1
’ in the past year alone the station stairs have accounted for a dislocated shoulder , a twisted knee and a sprained back , all of which required hospital treatment and led to numerous days off work			1
every police station houses a fast response team of officers , who are usually first to the scene of an emergency incident			0
@entity4 police station on @entity63 is one of the force ’s busiest hubs , covering the city centre and immediate surrounding areas			2
station : three constables have suffered serious injuries in the past year alone trying to get down the stairs the response team can be called out dozens of times each shift and such teams are normally located close to station exits for a quick getaway			1
but at @entity4 the team , which includes officers armed with electronic taser guns , are housed on the top floor with no means of getting to the exits apart from a ‘ crumbling ’ staircase			1
‘ it ’s just plain stupid for us to be in the most inaccessible part of the station when we are the ones who need to exit it the fastest , ’ said the officer			0
‘ the last thing they need is a @entity94 - style assault course to negotiate before they ’ve even got outside			0
’ taking care : one constable , who is part of the 30 - strong response team , said that his colleagues now lose vital minutes by having to walk slowly down the stairs to avoid injury			0
' it 's a real health hazard , ' he said ( file picture ) @entity104 , of the @entity105 , said : ‘ i ’ve not been contacted about these particular incidents but i would urge any officer who has concerns about health and safety issues to bring them to our , or a senior officer ’s , attention			0
’ but superintendent @entity113 , from @entity114 , confirmed : ‘ there have been two reported incidents at @entity4 over the last 12 months , involving police officers falling or slipping on stairs as they respond to calls for service			2
‘ as a result of this , we are in the process of fitting grip strips to all the stairs at the location which will hopefully prevent any further incidents such as this			0
