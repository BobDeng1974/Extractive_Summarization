up to 40 travellers descended on the car park of @entity14 ceramics designer @entity12 ’s factory in @entity15 , @entity16 , earlier this week			1

up to 40 gipsies have set up camp at the back of @entity12 ’s factory in @entity15 , @entity16 the gipsies said they had travelled from @entity2 to @entity15 to stock up on @entity7 tableware the gipsies said they had travelled all the way from @entity31 just to buy the tableware – which is more commonly associated with the @entity34 and @entity7 households across the world			1
however , they were surprised to learn that they had set up camp outside the wrong factory – as it was the @entity41 factory on the opposite side of the city which was once home to @entity7 tableware			1
@entity45 , the boss of the @entity12 factory which stocks the famous ceramics designer ’s works , told the gipsies the pottery was no longer made in @entity14			1
he said : ‘ they were all @entity2 and arrived here on sunday night			2
‘ i had a conversation with them and they asked where they could buy @entity7 tableware and i told them to go to the @entity41 factory shop in @entity60 in @entity16			1
‘ traditional @entity62 gipsies have been known to collect @entity63 but these wanted @entity7			1
the group , who brought about 12 caravans with them , were disappointed to learn they could n't buy @entity7 china at @entity14 ceramics designer @entity12 ’s factory the travellers have left factory workers needing to find alternative places to park when they arrive at work ‘ i told them that it should be made in @entity77 - on - @entity78 but unfortunately it is now made abroad and they tutted			1
’ the arrival of the 12 caravans has left factory workers needing to find alternative places to park when they turn up to work			0
mr @entity45 added : ‘ the only disadvantage is that they do take up a lot of the car park which could become awkward for our customers , especially when we get quite a lot of visitors			0
‘ it could affect our business if people ca n’t park but they did say they would n’t be staying long			0
‘ we have had trouble in the past with things going missing but that happens even when we do n’t have gipsies nearby so i am not overly concerned			0
’ the car park is owned by @entity77 but is leased to the pottery factory which means the owners must take action to remove them and clean the site			2
residents living near the site said they wanted to see the back of the @entity2 travellers as soon as possible			2
it is understood the travellers mistakenly set up camp outside @entity12 's factory ( above ) instead of the nearby @entity114 which once was home to the prestigious @entity7 tableware @entity12 ( above ) is a @entity14 ceramics designer who makes all of her pottery in @entity77 - on - @entity78 the travellers were hoping to snap up some of the @entity7 tableware collection ( above , file picture ) @entity122 , 31 , said : ‘ i noticed the car park was full of caravans on monday morning and i was shocked			1

i would n’t like them to stay for long			0
’ and @entity127 , 45 , added : ‘ i hope they do n’t stay for long now they know the stuff they want is n’t made here			0
‘ it is nice that they came and wanted to buy our famous pottery but sadly they will have to travel elsewhere to try and get what they are after			0
’ experts believe the gipsies want the @entity7 ware to decorate their caravans			1
travellers ’ @entity144 editor @entity143 said : ‘ traditionally china was one of the main means of investment			0
‘ it goes back to the days when most gipsies did n’t have bank accounts , so they would invest in gold jewellery and china , but nowadays it plays more of a decorative role			2
‘ @entity63 is very popular			0
it is refreshing to hear that the owner of the business spoke to them and is being patient			0
the travellers are said to be moving on from the area in due course after being unable to buy the royal china residents living near the site said they want the gipsies to move away from the area sooner rather than later ‘ there are many families who take pride in not leaving a mess and there is nothing more depressing than knowing you will be tarred with that brush when others do it			1
’ the @entity7 brand was created 110 years ago in 1904 and the prestigious ware was first made at a factory in @entity181 , @entity15			1
