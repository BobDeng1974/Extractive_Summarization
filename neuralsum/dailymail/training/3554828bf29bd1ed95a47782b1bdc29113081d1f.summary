@entity20 with her mother @entity11 , father @entity10 , and elder sister @entity23			1
mrs @entity6 says @entity6 communicates with her eyes @entity11 , 27 , said : ' we have to think about every noise we make in the house every day			1
if you sneeze or cough you can make her fit			2
you have got to be absolutely quiet			2
' it is a startle reflex			0
if someone gets up suddenly or she hears your shoe on the floor it startles her			0
' i ’ve even had to put my house phone put it on the low setting , because the ring can make her fit			2
' placed house phone on the lowest setting told eldest daughter @entity41 , 8 , to play ' as quietly as she can ' make sure they do n't sneeze or cough near @entity43 @entity44 also do n't make sudden movements , like getting up quickly by her only one alarm in house , which rings when @entity6 has a fit			1
parent 's then take turns of check on her overnight the youngster suffers from two rare brain conditions called polymicrogyria and @entity57 - and these trigger her epilepsy			2
the couple only discovered something was wrong after they took their daughter to a doctor when she began twitching at four months			0
@entity6 has a sister @entity41 , eight , who knows she has to play ' as quietly as she can ' to keep her safe			1
one of the fits could be fatal - but most see @entity6 slip into a trance like state that lasts about 20 seconds			1
the worst fits are called tonic - clonic seizures when @entity43 turns blue and stops breathing			2
@entity11 , of @entity73 , @entity74 , treated her with emergency medicine to save her life during the worst attacks			1
she said : ' we have learned to be able to manage at home without ringing the ambulance			0
the doctors have told us she is probably never going to speak or sit or walk			1
' we would love to hear what her voice is like and things like that but we have come to terms that that is not going to happen			0
' i communicate with her with her eyes			0
i can tell by the expressions on her face whether she is happy or sad			0
' @entity43 , pictured with her mother , can not walk or talk , but can express emotions @entity6 is not expected to live past 40 , but her mother says her smile gets them through each day there is one alarm which rings out in the house - it is triggered if @entity6 fits in her sleep			1
@entity10 and @entity11 then take turns to look after her while the other sleeps			0
' we have a nurse who comes one night a week so we have a full night sleep a week , ' said @entity11			0
you just shut your eyes and when you wake up about 10 hours are gone			0
i do n’t think we would cope without that			0
' doctors say she may live to adulthood , but is not likely to survive past 40			2
but @entity11 said : ' as long as she smiles , that is what gets us through the day			1
her smile lights up her face			0
