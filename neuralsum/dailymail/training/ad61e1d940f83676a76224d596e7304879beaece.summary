by @entity0 published : 06:38 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 11:22 est , 30 october 2013 the author of a @entity3 biography has spoken out against a portrait that will appear on banknotes , claiming it makes the famous novelist look ' dim - witted '			1
@entity9 , writer of @entity10 @entity3 , said today she finds the selected image ' unforgivable ' as she believes the author ' is made to look like a doll '			1
speaking on @entity16 's @entity15 , dr @entity14 compared the portrait to ' a @entity19 makeover '			2
scroll down for audio dr @entity9 spoke out against the portrait of the famous author comparing it to a ' @entity19 make - over ' dr @entity14 said she felt the image was ' @entity25 ' and ' highly sentimentalised ' , suggesting it ' perpetuates this image she is a safe , cosy writer when she is not			1
' she said : ' she is a subversive writer , a feminist writer that writes about the social classes ' - adding the image had been ' airbrushed ' to make the author seem more feminine			1
but @entity32 , of the @entity3 in @entity33 , did not share the biographer 's view			2
' i agree her eyes are over-larged but she does not look like a doll , ' said ms @entity32 , who helped the @entity39 in their selection of pictures			0
after disagreeing with dr @entity14 's categorisation of the author as a ' proto - feminist ' , she said : ' oh come off it			2
yes it is prettified and yes she is wearing a bonnet but she always did			0
' an 1810 watercolor portrait of the author completed by her sister ( left ) , on which an 1870 version ( right ) was based the image , known as the @entity54 , is considered to be the only authentic painting of the author , which makes it difficult to know for certain what the she actually looked like			1
it will replace @entity61 on @entity39 £ 10 notes in 2017 , accompanied by the words : ' i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading			1
' the line is taken from the 1813 novel @entity68 and is uttered by the character @entity70 - an unpleasant woman who has a crush on male protagonist mr @entity72			0
however , critics have poked holes in the choice of quotation - which is in fact a vain attempt to seduce mr @entity72 who is busy reading			0
indeed , in a bid to distract him from his own book , @entity70 professes her love of literature when in fact she is bored senseless with the evening she has spent with a book			0
today 's heated discussion comes after the discovery of a second painting of the writer which is said to portray her in a different light			0
a second painting was discovered in 2011 that dr @entity14 believes is a more accurate portrait of the author dr @entity14 uncovered the work in 2011 , which she believes shows a different side to the writer she hails as ' the funniest to walk the planet '			1
she told the @entity102 : ' scholars know there was so much more to her			0
and for me this new picture encapsulates – almost too perfectly – that other side			2
' she 's a professional woman presenting herself to the world with the tools of her trade			0
it 's the image of @entity3 so many of us have been waiting for			1
' speaking at the time of her discovery , she said the @entity54 ' annoyed her ' as it made the writer seem ' pretty and dim '			0
the 1870 portrait selected by the @entity39 is based on a watercolor sketch by the author 's sister , @entity120 , completed in 1810			1
it appeared in the pages of @entity124 , published after the author 's death in 1817			2
written by the author 's nephew @entity128 - @entity128 , the book has been criticised by experts for its domestic portrayal of @entity128 's ' @entity133			0
' a second edition was published in 1871 , which included previously unknown material written by the @entity138 author			0
the portrait of @entity3 was selected in july after a lengthy campaign to see a female face on banknotes , following the announcement that @entity144 would replace @entity145 on £ 5 notes			1
@entity147 was the first woman to be featured , appearing on £ 10 notes from 1975 until 1994			1
the decision sparked concern over an apparent lack of female representation as , aside from the @entity154 who appears on all notes , no women would have appeared			1
@entity158 philosopher , @entity156 is currently the face of £ 20 notes , while steam engine manufacturers @entity161 and @entity163 appear on the new £ 50 notes			2
@entity161 and @entity163 replace sir @entity165 , the first governor of the @entity39 .			0
