the @entity1 will keep up to 1,000 more soldiers than previously planned in @entity3 into next year , outgoing @entity1 defense secretary @entity0 said on saturday , in a recognition of the still formidable challenge from @entity7 insurgents			1
@entity11 , confirming a change in the @entity1 drawdown schedule first reported by @entity10 in november , said the additional forces were needed because delays in signing security pacts had impacted plans to raise troops from other countries			2
however , he also said that a particularly violent surge of @entity7 attacks in @entity21 in the last two weeks was a reminder of the continued need for a foreign presence			0
@entity11 said saturday the @entity1 will keep as many as 1,000 more troops in @entity3 than planned @entity3 troops in ceremonial uniforms participate in an arrival ceremony for visiting @entity1 secretary of defense @entity0 at the @entity34 in @entity21 ' the recent wave of @entity7 attacks has made it clear that the international community must not waver in its support for a stable , secure and prosperous @entity3 , ' said @entity11 , who arrived in @entity21 unannounced on saturday morning			1
the @entity42 - led combat mission in @entity3 officially ends in two weeks with a sharp reduction in western forces , but troops that stay behind will still provide ' combat enabler ' support to @entity3 soldiers , @entity11 said			2
the @entity1 will also maintain a mission to fight @entity52 in the country , he added			0
' we have not forgotten what brought @entity1 to @entity3 over a decade ago , ' @entity11 said at a joint press conference with @entity3 president @entity28			1
' and we will take appropriate measures against @entity7 members who directly threaten @entity1 and coalition forces in @entity3 or provide direct support to @entity52			2
' @entity1 secretary of defense @entity0 speaks during a joint press conference			2
an additional 1,000 @entity1 troops will remain in @entity3 next year to meet a temporary shortfall in @entity42 forces @entity3 president @entity28 walks with @entity1 secretary of defense @entity0 ( r ) down a red carpet during an arrival ceremony at the @entity34 @entity3 's president @entity28 ( @entity69 ) reaches out to shake hands with @entity1 secretary of defense			1
the @entity1 will keep up to 1,000 more soldiers than previously planned in @entity3 into next year in a recognition of the still formidable challenge from @entity7 insurgents gen. @entity76 , the commander of international forces in @entity3 , said last week the ongoing @entity1 role would include limited air support to @entity3 soldiers			1
@entity11 , who resigned last week under pressure , said @entity1 forces could fall only to 10,800 troops , rather than 9,800 as originally planned			1
the additional troops could stay until the first few months of 2015			0
' but the president 's authorization will not change our troops ' missions , or the long - term timeline for our drawdown , ' @entity11 said on his last trip to the country as @entity95 chief			1
he appeared confident that the @entity1 would secure support from @entity42 allies in the next few weeks that would allow @entity1 force levels to drop back to 9,800			0
@entity11 's visit followed the bloodiest year in @entity3 since the war against @entity7 militants began in 2001			1
as of early november , about 4,600 members of the @entity3 security forces had been killed in 2014 , more than 6 percent higher than the same period of 2013			0
the spike in violence in the @entity3 capital was not a factor in the decision to keep more @entity1 troops in the country next year , a @entity95 official said the drawdown of @entity1 forces in @entity3 will be ' gradual ' compared with the withdrawal of troops from @entity118 , the first official said.in 2016 , the number of troops will slide down to 5,500 and by 2017 the coalition will consolidate to @entity21 even as @entity1 officials including @entity11 praised the accomplishments of @entity3 forces , the high rate of @entity3 casualties is seen as unsustainable and has raised questions about their vulnerability as foreign troops dwindle			1
earlier , @entity11 expressed confidence in the ability of @entity3 forces to defend @entity21 following the spike in attacks			0
@entity1 president @entity135 's drawdown strategy has attracted criticism , including from republicans in @entity138 , who say gains against the @entity7 could be lost in much the same way that violence returned to @entity118 after the @entity1 withdrawal			0
@entity11 warned against drawing comparisons between @entity118 and @entity3 , saying @entity3 want @entity1 forces to stay			2
' are there ( security ) gaps ? are there continued challenges ? and threats ? absolutely , ' @entity11 acknowledged , noting @entity3 would still struggle with ' pockets ' of @entity7 resistance			0
the @entity7 have become increasingly bold in their attacks and control several districts across a country where access to many areas is still limited by rugged terrain and poor security			0
maintaining a troop presence will allow the @entity1 to monitor the progress of the @entity3 security forces over time			0

up to 10,800 @entity1 troops will remain in @entity3 at the start of 2015
@entity11 's unannounced visit will include other stops in the region
the trip follows a recent *announcement* that he will step down as defense chief
