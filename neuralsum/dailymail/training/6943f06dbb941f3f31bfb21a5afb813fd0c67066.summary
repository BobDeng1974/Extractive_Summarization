by @entity0 published : 07:15 est , 28 april 2013 updated : 06:55 est , 29 april 2013 voters who back the @entity4 @entity3 are racists and its politicians are clowns , @entity1 claimed yesterday			1
the veteran @entity8 cabinet minister led attacks by all three main parties as he said @entity3 is merely a protest party and those attracted to it are ‘ waifs and strays ’ who are simply ‘ against ’ foreigners and immigrants			1
mr @entity1 ’s astonishing onslaught came as polls showed that @entity23 ’s @entity22 party has overtaken the @entity24 and is set for its best local election results ever on thursday , when 35 county councils and unitary authorities in @entity28 and one in @entity30 go to the polls			2
attack : cabinet minister @entity1 branded @entity3 's politicians ' clowns ' and some of their supporters racist in a high - risk manoeuvre , mr @entity1 took aim not just at @entity3 leaders and their candidates , but also at voters who are considering backing the party , many of whom are disillusioned @entity8 supporters angry about @entity45 ’s stance on immigration and gay marriage			1
@entity3 called the @entity8 onslaught a ‘ morally reprehensible smear campaign ’ last night – but the party has also faced a series of damaging claims about the background of some of its candidates			1
asked whether he agreed with @entity45 ’s 2006 assessment that @entity3 is packed with ‘ fruitcakes and closet racists ’ , mr @entity1 replied : ‘ i have met people who satisfy both those descriptions in @entity3			1
' indeed , some of the people who have assured me they are going to vote @entity3 i would put in that category			2
i rather suspect they have never voted for me			0
' email leak : @entity66 also complained that forging @entity3 's policy platform is like ' herding cats ' , insisting senior figures needed to learn to toe the line he said he was sure that ‘ most of the @entity3 people are perfectly nice when they are having a drink ’ but added : ‘ it is very tempting to vote for a collection of clowns or indignant , angry people , who promise that somehow they will allow us to take your revenge on people who caused it			1
’ mr @entity1 dismissed @entity3 as a protest party , saying : ‘ it is against the political parties , the political classes , it ’s against foreigners , it ’s against immigrants but it does n’t have any very positive policies , they do n’t know what they ’re for			1
’ he criticised @entity3 for putting up candidates who have been exposed as former members of the racist @entity91 or the @entity92 , who have been kicked out of the party in the past week			2
‘ they of course have not been able to vet their candidates , ’ he said			0
‘ fringe right parties do tend to collect a number of waifs and strays			0
’ some of mr @entity1 ’s comments echo those of former @entity8 donor @entity103 , who said @entity3 was for ‘ none of the above ’ voters but privately @entity105 voiced doubts whether mr @entity1 , the most pro-european @entity8 , was the best person to make the case against @entity3 to @entity22 voters			1
@entity3 leader @entity23 said : ‘ it ’s a bit rich of @entity1 to call @entity3 clowns when he wanted us to join the euro			1
’ in february , @entity3 beat the @entity114 into second place in the @entity116 by - election and party strategists fear they could take @entity8 seats on thursday when they field 1,700 candidates			1
the @entity114 are defending more than 30 councils and are widely expected to lose between 300 and 400 councillors , while @entity123 are expected to pick up 300 and @entity3 around 50			1
the @entity24 are expected to lose around 100			0
discussions : in the recent exchange with treasurer @entity126 ( pictured ) , mr @entity66 cautioned that ' some quite senior party members are going to have to stable their hobby horses ' transport secretary @entity129 insisted the @entity114 have no reason to be worried about @entity3 , because @entity23 ’s party ‘ says different things to different people ’			1
but election expert professor @entity134 of @entity135 said : ‘ some people are going from @entity123 to @entity3 and @entity24 to @entity3 but the biggest loss to @entity3 is suffered by the @entity114			1
lord @entity103 has warned prime minister @entity45 that he faces defeat at the general election in two years ’ time			0
the @entity114 ’ biggest donor of the last decade put together a poll suggesting @entity123 will gain 109 seats at the 2015 election , including 93 from the @entity8			2
the predicted result by the former deputy chairman of the @entity8 would make @entity147 prime minister and give @entity123 a @entity149 majority of 84 seats			0
lord @entity103 told the @entity154 : ‘ even now , 16 years after they dismissed us from office , many people who would once have been natural supporters still do not think the party is on their side			0
‘ mr @entity45 faces the unenviable task of showing , at a time of austerity , that his party is not just for those who have already achieved material success , while holding on to @entity8 loyalists and luring back those threatening to defect to @entity3			2
’ ‘ polls show that 16 per cent of conservative voters in 2010 would vote for @entity3 , while it ’s 8 per cent for the @entity24 and 4 per cent for @entity123			2
' that ’s an important part of why the @entity114 are behind @entity123 in the polls			0
’ @entity24 leader @entity170 said voters were only backing @entity3 because they want to say ‘ to hell with mainstream politics ’			0
@entity123 ’s @entity174 said some of the party ’s candidates appeared ‘ pretty unappealing ’			0
but @entity3 deputy leader @entity178 accused the @entity114 of running a ‘ morally reprehensible smear campaign ’ against his party and boasted that their support is growing			1
he said : ‘ we ’re putting on over 100 members a day at the moment			0
membership is about 27,000 at the moment , and we ’re about 17 per cent in the polls , so i think all bets are off			0
’ lord @entity103 , who ran a poll on why people backed @entity3 at @entity116 , said @entity3 has simply cultivated voter grievances			0
‘ my poll in @entity116 found that more than four in five of your voters there were protesting about something , ’ he said			0
in an open letter to mr @entity23 yesterday , he said : ‘ @entity3 has gone from being an anti-eu movement to a broader - based none - of - the - above party			2
the most successful none - of - the - above party but a none - of - the - above party nonetheless			0
