by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:39 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 08:16 est , 20 october 2012 resignation : @entity3 mp looking very damp as he made his way home this afternoon just hours before sending his letter of resignation @entity3 sensationally quit as @entity8 ’s chief whip last night – exactly a month after launching a foul - mouthed tirade at police officers in @entity11			1
mr @entity3 travelled to @entity12 at 4pm yesterday to tell the prime minister he had lost the confidence of @entity16 mps and was resigning immediately after just six weeks in the job			1
the move came after senior ministers , including @entity20 , @entity21 and mr @entity3 ’s own deputy @entity22 told him his position was untenable			1
his departure caps another dismal week for the government , in which good news on unemployment was overshadowed by a shambolic announcement on energy bills and revelations last night that the chancellor @entity32 had been caught travelling in a first class rail carriage with a standard ticket			1
in an extraordinary resignation letter mr @entity3 denied calling police officers ‘ plebs ’ , as they have claimed , but admitted swearing at them , telling the prime minister he had said : ‘ i thought you guys were supposed to * * * * ing help us			1
’ this appears to contradict an appearance in the @entity47 earlier this week when he was seen mouthing the words ‘ i did n’t swear ’			1
he said in his letter : ‘ over the last two days it has become clear to me that whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter i will not be able to fulfil my duties as we would both wish			1
’ senior @entity57 were last night hoping his departure would draw a line under the damaging affair , which has revived the toxic suggestion that the party does not care about ordinary people			1
but it raises serious questions about the prime minister ’s judgment in trying to shield mr @entity3 in the first place			1
scroll down for @entity3 's resignation letter ... and @entity66 's response quit : the letter @entity3 sent to @entity8 as he handed in his resignation today denial : despite his resignation @entity3 maintains that he did n't call a police officer a ' pleb ' calling for his head : labour leader @entity76 had urged the @entity57 to sack @entity3 and even called for him to be arrested last night former commons leader sir @entity77 was brought back into @entity78 as chief whip			1
the appointment will avert the need for mr @entity8 to make other changes as sir @entity32 does not currently hold a ministerial post			2
the @entity16 grandee was thought to have retired to the backbenches after giving up his position as @entity87 to make way for former health secretary @entity89			2
sir @entity32 has been an mp since 1974 and held a variety of ministerial posts in the 1980s and 1990s			2
mr @entity8 had repeatedly defended mr @entity3 , saying that although his outburst had been unacceptable , he had apologised			2
but the row refused to die down , with the @entity94 , @entity95 , and many @entity57 continuing to press for the chief whip to go			2
@entity20 and work and pensions secretary @entity21 are understood to have been instrumental in mr @entity3 ’s departure			2
a @entity78 source said the pair had been ‘ deeply unimpressed ’ by his outburst			2
mr @entity3 ’s deputy @entity22 was also a key figure in his downfall but other members of the whips ’ office also made clear their unhappiness at having to work under mr @entity3			2
‘ @entity3 has had a succession of colleagues coming to him since @entity109 returned this week saying they think it would be difficult for him to go on , ’ said the @entity78 source			2
a @entity11 source said : ‘ the prime minister ’s view of the original episode was that he had apologised , and most importantly the police officer concerned had accepted that apology			1
‘ but @entity3 had come to the conclusion that he was unable to continue to do his job properly , which is a different issue			2
’ mr @entity3 ’s resignation came exactly a month after he lost his temper with police officers who stopped him riding his bicycle out of the gates of @entity11			1
in a police report , the officer involved said mr @entity3 told him : ‘ best you learn your * * * * ing place			1
you do n’t run this * * * * ing government			2
you ’re * * * * ing plebs			1
’ he then added : ‘ you have n’t heard the last of this			0
’ in his resignation letter he maintained that his outburst had not been as bad as portrayed			1
the prime minister said he was ‘ sorry ’ to lose mr @entity3 but understood why he was leaving			0
@entity32 mp , @entity95 ’s shadow cabinet office minister said : ‘ what people will want to know is why , when the entire country could see that what @entity3 did was wrong , the prime minister totally failed to act			0
' dear @entity8 , it is with enormous regret - not least because of the tremendous support and loyalty you have shown me during recent weeks - that i am writing to resign as your chief whip			0
over the last two days it has become clear to me that whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter i will not be able to fulfil my duties as we both would wish			1
nor is it fair to continue to put my family and colleagues through this upsetting and damaging publicity			0
i have made clear to you - and i give you my categorical assurance again - that i did not , never have , and never would call a police officer a " pleb " or a " moron " or used any of the other pejorative descriptions attributed to me			1
the offending comment and the reason for my apology to the police was my parting remark " i thought you guys were supposed to f * * * ing help us "			1
it was obviously wrong of me to use such bad language and i am very sorry about it and grateful to the police officer for accepting my apology			1
i am immensely grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to serve as your development secretary for seven and a half years , both in @entity177 and in @entity178			0
i believe @entity180 , under your leadership , has made real progress in transforming the lives and the opportunities of some of the world 's poorest people and that we will continue to do so as we deploy an expertise and commitment which show @entity180 at its best			0
i now intend to concentrate on serving my constituents in the @entity192 town of @entity193 to the best of my ability and giving you the strong support you rightly deserve from all members of the @entity16			0
with every good wish , yours ever , @entity3			0
dear @entity3 , thank you for your letter			0
i was sorry to receive it , but i understand why you have reached the conclusion that you have , and why you have decided to resign from the government			0
i regret that this has become necessary , and am very grateful for all you have done , both in @entity178 and in @entity177 - as well as for the kind words in your letter			0
i am in no doubt that your work in the field of international development has made a really important contribution - not only to the @entity16 , but more importantly to @entity180 's standing in the world , and above all to international efforts to tackle deep and sustained poverty			0
you brought real passion to the job in @entity177 , which you turned into more than two years of very successful work in @entity178			0
you brought immense energy and dedication to the role , a focus on the world 's poorest , and decisive progress on the key issues of vaccination against preventable diseases , maternal health and family planning that make the greatest difference to the greatest number of people			0
you have also brought a proper accountability and transparency to the @entity238 's work			0
under your leadership of the @entity238 , @entity180 achieved a leading global role , which will be continued as @entity180 chairs the @entity242 @entity241			0
as we discussed in advance of the reshuffle , i wanted you to bring your organisational skill and energy to the important job of chief whip			0
it was clear to me that you had already made a strong start			0
as you have acknowledged , the incident in @entity11 was not acceptable and you were right to apologise for it			1
you have much to be proud of from your service on the @entity256 both in @entity177 and in @entity178 , and in your continued service to your constituents in @entity193			0
i hope that , in time , you will be able to make a further contribution to public life			0
