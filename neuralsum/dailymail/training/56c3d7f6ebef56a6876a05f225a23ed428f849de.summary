by @entity0 the @entity1 has seen an alarming rise in the number of under 65s needing knee replacements and the @entity6 is expected to follow suit the number of younger people needing knee replacements is expected to rise because of soaring obesity rates , a study suggests			1
an alarming rise in under 65s having the surgery in the @entity1 is being blamed on junk food diets and lack of exercise - with fears growing that the @entity6 will follow suit			1
data suggests the phenomenon is happening on both sides of the @entity24 because of the pressure bulging waistlines are putting on the joints			2
there are also concerns people 's artificial knees will not survive under the strain			1
the latest research in the @entity1 shows total knee replacements ( @entity35 ) were easily outpacing total hip replacements ( @entity37 ) over the past 20 years - coinciding with the obesity epidemic			1
dr @entity39 , an orthopaedic surgeon at the @entity40 in @entity41 , said : ‘ because excess body weight appears to be more damaging to the knee than to the hip the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity may explain the growing demand for knee replacements over hip replacements			1
’ in 1993 surgeons performed 1.16 @entity51 for every @entity37 - but this ratio grew to 1.6 by 2009 , says the study published in the @entity54			2
interestingly , patients aged 18 to 64 experienced a more rapid rise in obesity compared to those who were older			1
from 1997 to 2009 the share of the younger group undergoing @entity35 rose 56 per cent compared with only 35 per cent for @entity37			2
dr @entity39 said : ‘ we observed growth of knee replacement volumes was far outpacing that of hip replacements and were curious as to the origins of this trend			1
’ previous studies have found a strong link between a higher @entity69 ( body mass index ) and knee osteoarthritis			2
the effects of weight on hip osteoarthritis were less clear			2
so the researchers reviewed at least 10 years of national data up to 2009 on numbers of knee and hip replacements , length of hospital stay , in - hospital mortality and orthopaedic workforce trends			0
they found @entity51 have far outstripped @entity37 for patients with a @entity69 of at least 25 - which is considered overweight - or 30 , which is deemed obese			0
but the same pattern was not seen for those with a @entity69 of less than 25			0
the researchers also looked at whether payment could have played a part which does not seem to be the case			0
fees for @entity35 in the @entity1 fell from about $ 3,000 a case in 1995 to $ 1,560 in 2009 and those for @entity37 from $ 2,840 to $ 1,460			1
the trend is being blamed on soaring obesity rates as heavier people put more pressure on their joints as this represents an approximate 48 per cent drop in fees for both procedures surgeons do not appear to be performing more @entity35 over @entity37 because of higher reimbursement			1
hospital reimbursement , length of hospital stay and in - hospital mortality pertaining to @entity35 and @entity37 also comparably declined between 1995 and 2009			0
dr @entity39 said : ‘ we found this differential growth rate in total knee replacement procedures could not be attributed to changes in physician or hospital payments , length of hospital stays , in - hospital death rates or surgical work force characteristics			0
’ junk food diets are thought to be responsible for the rising obesity levels which are fuelling the demand for knee replacements a couple of years ago figures for the @entity6 showed an emerging trend of requests for knee replacements for arthritic ‘ baby boomers ’ in their 50s			1
a report in the journal @entity134 said work is urgently needed to check if giving artificial joints to this age group is wise given the product ’s unknown life expectancy			0
the durability of the replacement knees has only been assessed in patients in their 60s , 70s and 80s - not in their 50s			2
best estimates suggest the joints last for about 15 years in these older and often less physically active recipients			0
dr @entity39 said : ‘ if rates of overweight and obesity continue to climb we should expect further acceleration in the number of knee replacements performed annually in the @entity1 with a more modest increase in hip replacement volumes			1
‘ this knowledge can inform future policy decisions regarding health care funding and surgical workforce training as well as guide allocation of preventative health resources			0
’ professor @entity161 , of the @entity162 , said he was not surprised @entity1 doctors are blaming an alarming rise in surgery in the under 65s on junk food diets and lack of exercise			1
the national clinical director for musculoskeletal services for @entity173 said : ‘ we are a little bit behind the @entity175 - we are not quite as fat yet - but we are getting there			0
‘ we must get the message across to patients and the public at large to lose weight and get fitter so they do not need knee replacements			0
‘ it ’s easy to say we should be fitter but heart disease , lung disease and cancer can be avoided - and mental health boosted - by improvements in lifestyle			0
’ he said the total number of knee replacement procedures entered into the @entity191 during 2012 was 90,842 - an increase of 7.3 per cent compared with 2011			2
of these , 84,833 were primary cases of which osteoarthritis was blamed for 98 per cent of them .			0

huge rise in the number of under 65s in the @entity1 needing the surgery
the @entity6 is expected to follow the trend *due* to increasing obesity levels
experts said as people get heavier , more stress is put on their knees
