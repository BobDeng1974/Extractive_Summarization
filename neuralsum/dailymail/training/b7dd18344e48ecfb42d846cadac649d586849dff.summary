by @entity0 published : 11:36 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 06:19 est , 1 may 2012 just last week he sparked controversy by claiming that those who could n't take the pain of his heels should not wear them			2
but today , as he unveiled an exhibition featuring hundreds of pairs of his sought - after heels at @entity13 's @entity12 , @entity10 thought it wise to backpedal slightly			1
@entity10 , who began his career more than 20 years ago , hit the headlines when he called high heels ' pleasure with pain ' , adding , ' if you ca n't walk in them , do n't wear them			1
' but at this morning 's preview , he defended the remark , saying : ' i am concerned with comfort			2
i know that it 's important but i do n't want to have this evoked in my design			1
' i am concerned with comfort , but i do n't want this evoked in my design ' : @entity10 defended his ' heels are pain ' comment at the unveiling of his 20 year retrospective at @entity13 's @entity12 today hundreds of pairs of the designer 's red - soled shoes went on show at the space , celebrating 20 years of the @entity10 brand ' my work is not about comfort but in the engineering of the shoes there 's something that makes them as comfortable as possible			1
' the exhibition , which will run for 10 weeks , has burlesque star @entity51 star as a stunning centrepiece			1
@entity10 , famous for the red soles on his stilettos , has made @entity55 , one of his most fiercely loyal customers , appear in the form of a three - dimensional holographic performance to illustrate @entity10 's earliest design inspiration - the showgirl			1
star of the show @entity51 attended a private viewing of the exhibition last night , where she was said to be ' thrilled ' with the dancing hologram @entity51 is the stunning holographic centrepiece of the exhibition celebrating the famous red - soled footwear brand			1
an image of the burlesque dancer morphs from a stiletto to perform a dance on stage in homage to his early inspiration from showgirls , @entity10 has @entity51 as a key feature in the exhibit the burlesque performer 's silhouette morphs from a @entity10 shoe to dance on stage before she transforms back into a stiletto			1
but despite his fondess for @entity55 , @entity10 , who opened his first boutique in @entity84 20 years ago with princess @entity85 as his first customer , has always maintained his passion lies not in impressing celebrity , but in creating shoes that are , he says , ' like jewels '			1
he guards his red soles jealously - @entity94 18 @entity93 red - and is currently embroiled in an ongoing legal battle with @entity96 over their use of a red sole			2
elsewhere though , he says it matters not if others use colour on their soles			2
speaking today , @entity10 also gave his blessing to @entity106 boss sir @entity105 's daughter @entity104 , who has designed green - heeled shoes for her father 's store			1
' it has her name on the shoe			1
there 's nothing wrong with that			2
i wish her luck , ' he said			2
he said it was ' a bit emotional ' to see his first @entity123 exhibition because his work has been so inextricably linked to his personal life			2
' having an exhibition about [ my work ] is a big premiere for me and it 's quite a journey			2
' but this journey has lasted for 20 years so to me it makes me to see what was missing , what i have forgotten , what was bringing me memories , what was bringing me less good memories , actually not so much			0
but basically it made me go through a big part of my life			0
' ' it is interesting to see after 20 years what you have been keeping , what you miss and what you are missing			0
' ' it is about my life , and in a way it is a bit emotional to see work which is also related to a personal life			0
i never really separated my private life to my professional life			0
all the love that i have for one it goes in the other			0
' heels should be painful ? these look like they 'd fit the bill : louboutin ballet pumps and an ultra-high patent heel on show at the retrospective bringing new meaning to spike heels : @entity167 with crystals and spike embellishment the devil is in the detail , and the techniques involved in creating @entity10 's flourishes elevate the designer to star status @entity10 's intricately designed shoes have been worn by an impressive roll call of celebrities - but the designer says what really matters to him is to make shoes that are ' like jewels ' the exhibition will be the first comprehensive presentation of @entity10 's work , and will showcase how he has helped transform the design of the shoe over the past 20 years erotic ? @entity10 has said in the past that the arch of a woman 's foot in a high heel emulates its shape when she orgasms shoes say a lot about a woman , @entity10 says			1
' there is an element of seduction in shoes that does n’t exist for men … a woman can be sexy , charming , witty or shy with her shoes ' dozens of cobblers ' moulds are on show at the @entity12 - all in @entity10 red to match his soles , which is a @entity94 colour trademarked by @entity10 @entity10 always wanted to design shoes that ' looked like jewels ' @entity10 was born in 1963 in @entity84 , son of a cabinenetmaker father and a mother who stayed at home to look after the boy and his three sisters			1
unruly as a child , he was expelled from school three times and ran away from home aged 12			0
he never returned , either to home or to school , but began sketching shoes in his early teens			0
a regular on the @entity84 party scene , he made the acquaintance of the likes of @entity231 and @entity232 , becoming part of the in - crowd			0
his first job was at the @entity237 cabaret , helping the showgirls backstage - and it was this scene that has provided him with so much inspiration over the years			0
there was some formal training - a short stint studying art at the @entity244			0
but for @entity10 , it was a visit to the @entity246 in @entity84 that he felt moved to make high heels for women			1
at the exhibition he saw a sign in a photograph forbidding women in heels to enter a building for fear of damaging the floor			0
' i wanted to defy that , ' the designer said			0
' i wanted to create something that broke rules and made women feel confident and empowered			0
' solo trips to @entity264 and @entity265 as a teen provided him with yet more colour and imagery to feed from , and when he returned to @entity84 in 1981 , @entity10 presented his ideas for high heels to top couture houses , landing him a position with @entity273			1
he later went to work as an apprentice in the atelier of @entity277 , shoemaker to the @entity278 and widely regarded as one of the world 's top shoe designers			2
later , as a freelance designer , he created shoes for @entity284 , @entity96 and @entity285 , before setting up his own company in 1991 in @entity84 with princess @entity85 his first customer			0
since then , he has dressed the feet of such stars as @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity51			1
he has said his goal is to ' make a woman 's legs look as long as they can ; ' and says of his shoes that they should make a woman look ' naked '			0
' if a woman is naked and wearing my shoes , she should still look naked			0
