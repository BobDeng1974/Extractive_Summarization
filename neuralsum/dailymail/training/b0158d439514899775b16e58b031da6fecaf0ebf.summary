@entity1 , 29 , was walking his two pet rottweilers off the lead along @entity12 in @entity13 when one attacked a young boy as he was paddling in the sea and dragged him underwater			1
@entity1 fled the scene immediately on august 5 last year prompting a six - month police campaign to track the mystery dog owner			1
the young boy - who can not be named for legal reasons - was rescued by his grandmother and needed 60 stitches after suffering several puncture wounds to his left arm and shoulder during the attack			2
he has since endured three separate operations and will be offered plastic surgery when he reaches the age of 18 due to the extent of his injuries			2
the unemployed builder , from @entity34 , @entity35 , was eventually arrested in february after his own mother shopped him to police after recognising him fleeing the scene in @entity8 footage posted on video site @entity9			1
@entity1 appeared in the dock at @entity42 today wearing a black suit and tie with a suitcase packed in anticipation of an extended stay in jail			1
he was sentenced to 16 months in prison having pleaded guilty in march to being in charge of a dog which was dangerously out of control in a public place and caused injury			0
judge @entity55 said : ' the fact that the boy did not drown or was not mauled to a greater extent was down to the heroic and selfless actions of his grandmother			2
' you allowed your dogs to roam without muzzles on a public beach			0
the behaviour you displayed after the event shows a callous disregard for the welfare of the victim			0
free to roam : @entity1 let his two rottweilers off the lead on a public beach in @entity72 ( picture of a similar @entity75 dog ) victim : the seven - year - old boy needed 60 stitches and three operations after being attacked by a @entity75 judge @entity55 , sitting at @entity42 @entity80 , said @entity1 's only remorse was for his ' own fate ' ' you left the scene and made yourself scarce			1
it was only thanks to the vigilance of others on @entity9 that you were traced			1
' you had every interest in escaping without being brought to account			0
any remorse you have shown is merely for your own fate			0
' but judge @entity92 banned @entity1 from keeping a dog for the next 10 years and a destruction order was made for the four - year - old rottweiler			1
after sentencing the family of the boy said : ' we can never say enough how grateful we are that we still have our grandson and that he seems to be recovering well despite his injuries			2
' we are pleased with today ’s sentence and feel it was completely irresponsible of the defendant to take two large dogs onto a beach without being able to control them on leads			0
' all dogs of that stature and aggressive nature should be on a short lead with a muzzle when out in a public place			0
' if people want to own dogs like that they must understand the responsibility they have to others ’ safety			0
