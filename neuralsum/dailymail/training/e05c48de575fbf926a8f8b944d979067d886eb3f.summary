official report : lord @entity2 ' review has flattened claims that taxpayers may have lost £ 1billion as the government privatisation undervalued @entity6 taxpayers were short - changed by £ 180million after the sale of @entity6 - but not the £ 1billion predicted at the time , an official report said today			1
there was fury during the sale last october when shares were sold for 330p , raising almost £ 2billion , but within a week they were worth 550p			1
opponents said the government had mishandled the deal and could have received millions more for the public purse when the privatisation went ahead			0
former city minister @entity2 said today the sell - off was executed with ' considerable professionalism ' and the government and taxpayer achieved ' significant value '			1
he said that raising the share price sale level by more than 30p to 350p could have put the whole deal at risk			1
this would have raised the extra £ 180million			1
the government sold 60 per cent of @entity6			2
@entity2 said : ' this is a seminal piece of work which has the potential to fundamentally alter the way companies are floated on the @entity35 stock market and i look forward to seeing how this develops			2
' i regard the @entity6 privatisation to have been a complex exercise executed with considerable professionalism			2
many previous governments attempted to sell but failed			0
the sale was done against a backdrop of global economic uncertainty and a threat of industrial action , which go a long way towards explaining the cautious approach taken throughout the process			0
' there were also some inherent complexities built into the transaction , such as a generous retail offer , which added to this caution			0
the government adopted conventional standard market practices built up over time			0
' we found no evidence to challenge the general assertion that an @entity61 price greater than 350 - 360p could have been achieved and we accept that a decision to revise the range would have come with added uncertainty and risk			1
the right decisions were made			0
' we do not believe that a price anywhere near the levels seen in the aftermarket could have been achieved at listing			2
the aftermarket conditions were extraordinary , unpredictable and did not reflect significant value ' left on the table ' as some concluded at the time			0
the government and taxpayer achieved significant value			1
' shares shortfall : there was fury when the sale went through because shares went for 330p - only to reach 550p within a week the @entity81 criticised the flotation earlier this year and an influential committee of mps made the claim in july that taxpayers may have lost £ 1billion as the government privatisation undervalued @entity6			1
the @entity88 said taxpayers missed out on ‘ significant value ’ when the government pushed through flotation of part of its stake in the mail delivery firm but did not focus on getting the best price for taxpayers			2
the @entity84 claimed the government feared ‘ failing ’ over the controversial sell - off and received poor advice			1
the @entity88 recommended changes for future sell - offs suggesting that companies that advise the government on share issues should be excluded from becoming a preferred investor			1
business secretary @entity104 said : ' i am very grateful to @entity2 and his expert panel for this important and insightful report			1
it contains a number of significant proposals which could make the general process of future sales more transparent			0
' i would encourage financial regulators and those bringing companies to market to engage in this debate			0
in particular they should explore how digital auctions could , in certain circumstances , make the sale process much more flexible			0
' i also welcome his comment that the sale was executed with considerable professionalism and that any decision to try to have priced the shares higher would have been risky			0
we were right not to take that risk			0

deal was done last october for 330p a share - but reached 550p days later
mps said @entity6 sell - off , which raised £ *2bn* , should have been £ *3bn*
but official report found that in fact the true figure was around £ 180m
@entity2 said that raising price to 350p would have been risky
his review found @entity143 and taxpayer achieved ' significant value '
