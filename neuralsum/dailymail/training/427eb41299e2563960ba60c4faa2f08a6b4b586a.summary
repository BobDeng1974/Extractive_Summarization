by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 coach @entity2 will be aiming to help lift the weight of history from the shoulders of his ageing stars when he leads them out at @entity9 on saturday			1
@entity2 is a @entity11 winner with @entity12 but his old @entity12 team - mate @entity13 is the only member of the @entity15 team to have experienced the joy of winning rugby league 's famous knockout trophy and that was away from @entity9			1
@entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 have formed the nucleus of the @entity3 team that won @entity28 's @entity27 at @entity29 a record six times as well as the @entity31 three times in the last decade but are still waiting to put the final piece in the jigsaw			1
holy grail : @entity2 ( right ) and @entity20 will be hoping to lead @entity3 to glory on saturday @entity3 are appearing in their 24th cup final - only @entity37 with 30 have more final appearances - and are looking to win it for the 12th time but a seventh defeat in the last 14 years would set a new record of 13			1
most of the neutrals at @entity9 are sure to be supporting underdogs @entity46 but few would begrudge @entity20 and company reaching their @entity48			2
' that 's my job , ' @entity2 said			1
' and if i can deliver it , it would mean a fair bit to me			2
' i 've listened to them all talk about it			2
i do n't think they go searching the streets for answers or looking in the stars because they 've all by their own right been very successful in everything except the @entity62			1
' it 's the missing piece in the jigsaw and i know it means a lot to them			1
if i can deliver that , i 'd be over the moon			2
i 'd be over the moon for myself as well			0
' since they last lifted the trophy at the old @entity9 in 1999 , with a 52 - 16 win over @entity73 , the @entity15 have lost finals in 2000 ( @entity12 at @entity75 ) , 2003 ( @entity12 at @entity76 ) , 2005 ( @entity77 at @entity76 ) , 2010 ( @entity78 at @entity9 ) , 2011 ( @entity37 at @entity9 ) and 2012 ( @entity78 at @entity9 )			1
touching distance : @entity3 have failed in each of their last six attempts to win the famous trophy @entity2 has been at the helm for @entity3 ' last two defeats but it has not dulled his enthusiasm for the 117 - year - old competition			1
' that novelty never wears off , ' he said			0
' there 's a lot of ceremony involved compared to a @entity27 , where you feel like you could turn up in your jeans and flip - flops and it would still be a big event			0
' there 's a fair bit of protocol you 've got to go through at @entity9			0
i suppose as a young player or coach , it 's a bit of a pain in the a * * * , you think ' let 's get on and play '			0
' but when you get older - and some of these lads have been in a few - you start to enjoy it , start meeting a few people			0
you know you are on show and that you are representing our sport			0
' despite their losing habit at @entity9 , @entity2 is hoping his side 's big - match experience will count for something against @entity118 's @entity46 , who won at @entity37 in the quarter - finals and recently held @entity3 to a draw in @entity28 at @entity122			1
last man standing : @entity13 is the only member of the @entity3 side to have won the @entity62 ' i do n't think it will give us a massive edge but it certainly helps us in preparation and , if you can get on the field and feel a bit more confident because of the preparation you 've had , it gives you an edge , ' @entity2 said			1
' but , when the whistle blows , i do n't think @entity46 will be too bothered about how many finals we 've appeared in			2
' we lost at their place in 2013 and this year had two very challenging games			2
i am sure they will be confident - they broke us down a couple of times in both those games , so it 's on			0
' what we 're not doing is planning for a team that chokes			0
cas wo n't choke , i guarantee it			0
they wo n't get there and freeze			0
we 're planning for a good @entity46			0

@entity3 have lost six finals in last 14 years
only @entity13 has won the @entity62 of this @entity3 squad
@entity2 determined to pick up ' missing piece in the jigsaw '
