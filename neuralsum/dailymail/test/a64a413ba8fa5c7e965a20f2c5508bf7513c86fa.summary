you get the impression around @entity3 cricket at the moment that people have a bit of a downer on @entity8			1
i have heard the comment ‘ how much longer before @entity8 comes under pressure for his place ? ’ from a few people in recent times			1
there should always be scrutiny on @entity19 players ’ places , i have no problem with that , but we have to be careful we do not get confused between @entity8 the bowler and @entity8 the batsman			1
fact is , in the last 14 tests @entity8 has taken 63 wickets at 24 apiece which is pretty good considering he ’s been carrying niggles and injuries			2
so there has not been much wrong with his bowling even though , as i said on wednesday , he ’s not quite at his best following his long lay - off after surgery			2
@entity8 ( right ) was dismissed for a duck in @entity19 's first innings against @entity37 in @entity38 @entity8 will always give you something different even though he can overdo it at times , and has always had the ability to get something out of a flat pitch			1
i still like the fact that he can turn into the enforcer , as he did before lunch on day three , and that he ’s a clever bowler , as he showed on the second day when he rolled his fingers down the side of the ball and dismissed @entity52 with a leg - cutter			1
@entity8 and @entity54 are an outstanding combination , taking 526 wickets between them in the 70 tests they have played together — a record that has seen them stand comparison with the partnership of sir @entity64 and @entity65			1
the 28 - year - old has seen his place in the side questioned , but he still produces with the ball @entity8 celebrates the wicket of @entity71 on day three of the first test against @entity37 in @entity38 and they complement each other as we saw again on wednesday when it was flat and there was n’t much happening for @entity54			1
that ’s when @entity8 , with his ability to make things happen , is so crucial for a captain			2
he has an ability to come up with that magic spell , one that changes the whole course of a match as we have seen him do in big @entity88			0
he gets under the skin of the @entity90 , too , which is never a bad thing			0
so this downer that i am sensing among the @entity3 cricket public clearly comes from the complete demise of @entity8 the batsman			1
not only does he appear to have lost all confidence in his batting but he seems a bit scared , too			0
@entity8 said in @entity90 that he suffered nightmares after being struck in the face by @entity103 ’s @entity102 last summer at @entity104 , which is something i personally would never have done			2
@entity8 admitted he had nightmares about being struck in the face by @entity103 's @entity102 last summer @entity8 can expect to face a barrage of short deliveries from the likes of @entity111 in the ashes broad scoring a century against @entity113 in 2010 you can imagine what the @entity90 felt when they heard an @entity3 saying he was having nightmares about the short ball			1
no one truly fancies the short stuff but most people do not admit to it publicly			0
the result is that @entity8 has become a bit gun - shy , he stays leg - side of the ball and tries to play a shot every delivery			1
and everybody wants their @entity19 cricketers to show a bit of character and fight			2
it ’s not going to be easy for @entity8			2
he is going to have @entity111 steaming in at him this summer bowling yorker , bouncer , and that is probably going to carry on for the rest of his career			0
he wo n’t be seeing too much spin			0
that ’s why test cricket is the hardest game			0
there is no place to hide and there ’s no let up			0
@entity8 will have to solve the problem himself and look at team - mates who have overcome adversity in their career like @entity54 and @entity150			1
we described @entity8 as an ‘ all - rounder ’ in a graphic on @entity154 the other day and immediately got some tweets querying that			1
but that ’s what @entity8 looked like becoming when he scored that big test hundred against @entity113			0
what he needs to do now is sit down with a recording of that century at @entity162 ’s five years ago and watch every single ball to see what he did then			0
@entity8 needs to remind himself that he can bat , that he can keep the ball out , and then get in the nets and get someone to hurl short ball after short ball at him			0
that ’s what i saw @entity174 doing at the @entity175 after he had been bounced out a couple of times			0
@entity8 ’s batting woes must not affect his bowling as @entity19 need him at his best			1
he shows a lot of character with the ball and is a steely performer			0
but with the bat he ’s showing no character and it ’s time he said ‘ enough ’s enough ’ .			0

@entity8 was dismissed for a duck in @entity19 's first innings
the 28 - year - old has had a complete demise in his batting
@entity8 must not let his batting woes must not affect his bowling
he is still is the enforcer and combines well with @entity54
