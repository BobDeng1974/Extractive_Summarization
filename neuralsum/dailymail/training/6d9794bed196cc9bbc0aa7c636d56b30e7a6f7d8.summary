beef from cows that are infected with bovine tuberculosis could be being served in schools and hospitals , it has emerged			1
the government has admitted that meat from 28,000 diseased cattle is sold every year to catering firms and some supermarkets			1
the @entity11 ( @entity12 ) is believed to be making £ 10million a year selling the infected carcasses			2
beef from cows infected with @entity15 is being used to supply schools , hospitals and the military			1
file picture officials claim the risk of catching the illness from eating infected meat is ‘ extremely low ’			1
but @entity24 has refused to sell the beef due to public health concerns and @entity27 ’s , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 have also chosen to ban it			0
herds are checked for bovine tb every one to four years			0
any infected cattle are slaughtered , and the government pay farmers up to £ 1,700 per animal in compensation			0
@entity12 claims the tuberculosis virus ( pictured ) is extremely unlikely to be transmitted through the meat , even when it is uncooked the meat is sold with no warning to processors or consumers that it comes from @entity46 infected cattle			1
file picture @entity12 can then sell the meat on to catering firms , processors or supermarkets without providing any warning labels			1
it is not clear what companies have bought the meat but @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 – which supply food to hospitals and schools – could not deny serving it			1
around 70 @entity62 become infected with bovine tuberculosis every year			0
the symptoms are similar to the more common ‘ human ’ form , which causes a severe cough , loss of appetite and weight loss			0
the human risk from bovine tuberculosis has been used to justify a cull of tens of thousands of badgers , which are believed to help spread the disease most people catch the illness by consuming infected milk or beef or by coming into contact with diseased cattle			2
the strain , which used to be very common , killed around 2,500 @entity62 each year in the 1920s and 1930s			0
many patients caught it from infected milk			0
the government subsequently introduced milk pasteurisation and the heating process now kills the bacteria carrying the disease			0
but the illness is on the rise in cattle , and experts are concerned it could soon become a health risk for humans again			2
the @entity99 , which is responsible for food safety , said if a cow was infected in one area of its body then the rest of its meat was fit for consumption			2
despite this , in 2005 one of @entity12 ’s own researchers – @entity111 – found meat from other areas of the cow could still infect humans			1
the government is so worried about the threat bovine tuberculosis poses to humans that it has ordered the cull of tens of thousands of badgers , who are thought to spread the disease between cows			0
however dr @entity126 , from @entity127 , stressed that the problem was not yet ‘ widespread ’ as the ‘ numbers now are very small ’			0
and a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ all meat from cattle slaughtered due to bovine tb must undergo rigorous food safety checks before it can be passed fit for consumption			2
‘ the risk of infection from eating meat , even if raw or undercooked , remains extremely low			1

meat from diseased animals being sold by farming ministry
many *manufacturers* reject it , but the meat is used schools and hospitals
@entity12 *defended* the sales , claiming risk of @entity15 transmission is ' extremely low '
