@entity11 was so caught up in the moment - he accidentally left his laptop , which contained his life 's work , on the train			1
in the picture the mayor is holding what appears to be a copy of @entity33 , the children 's comic			2
it is folded to show a page headed ' @entity38 ' , which may be @entity39 , who is a sidekick of @entity41			0
it was only moments later that he realised he had left on the train his laptop containing nearly 1,000 pages of rare scriptures he had collected from around the world			1
it was in a rucksack that also contained a camera , keys and his passport			1
since then , the bag has been handed in anonymously to @entity13 staff and his camera , keys and passport have been returned to him			1
but the all - important laptop , which disappeared as he travelled between @entity63 and @entity64 on april 10 , is still missing			2
mr @entity11 , who had become engrossed in a deep conversation with @entity4 about @entity66 during their brief meeting on the @entity70 train , had nearly complete drafts of two books on the laptop			1

fascinating conversationalist : @entity11 was so engrossed in his chat with @entity4 that he almost missed his stop and left his rucksack on train containing his laptop ‘ they have no information on the person who handed it in			1
perhaps they did not see who it was			0
’ mr @entity4 had been in @entity63 to attend a political event			0
mr @entity11 , whose charity is offering a £ 500 reward for the laptop ’s return , said : ‘ i saw @entity4 on the train and he was two or three seats in front of me			1
other people were having pictures with him , so i did too			0
‘ i thought he was a very modest person to take the tube and we talked about @entity66			2

’ the @entity2 , who had been travelling back from registering the birth of his baby daughter , added : ‘ some of the work has taken months and months , and have been taken from different books			0
‘ the laptop had two book ’s worth of material , around 900 pages that i had collected from around the world			0
