by @entity0 published : 16:49 est , 6 september 2012 updated : 03:54 est , 7 september 2012 @entity1 , 50 , was ambushed with his family on wednesday during a family outing in the @entity6 @entity5 three adult members of a seemingly respectable family , each murdered with a single shot in the head			1
a seven - year - old girl left with life - threatening injuries and her younger sister badly traumatised after somehow escaping alive from a psychopathic killer			2
a cyclist who is believed to have witnessed the bloodbath mercilessly assassinated			0
such barbarity would be shocking in some of the world ’s most lawless countries : @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 ... but for it to happen in a car park near the tranquil shores of @entity27 in the @entity6 @entity5 makes the crime infinitely more difficult to comprehend			1
and , crucially , much more difficult to solve			0
what better location for a professional hit than in a remote area , with few if any witnesses likely to see the atrocity , with quick road access to airports in three countries – @entity6 , @entity37 and @entity38 , and even further afield			1
as @entity6 police launched an extensive manhunt to find the killer or killers , investigators were officially keeping an open mind about the motive for the crime and who might have been behind it			2
the ruthless efficiency with which the murders were carried out suggested strongly that @entity1 , his wife @entity51 and the rest of his family were specific targets , and the cyclist killed because he saw too much			1
pictures of the murder scene – in an isolated forest car park , 2.5 miles from the nearest village – show how the @entity61 was hit with automatic fire before the victims were finished off at point - blank range			1
had mr @entity66 and his family been targeted in the @entity68 , police would probably have had access to @entity71 footage and data from number - plate recognition cameras , in their hunt for the killer ’s escape vehicle			2
a quick look at a local map shows he could have been out of @entity6 within minutes of the murders on wednesday , possibly boarding a plane from @entity93 within two hours			1
or perhaps he elected to drive several hours across @entity94			0
several witnesses reported seeing a car speeding away from the scene near @entity98 , in @entity6 ’s @entity100 region , close to the @entity37 and @entity38 borders , around the time of the attack			1
no arrests were made in the immediate aftermath of the attack , nor did police report the discovery of any weapon			0
bullet - ridden : police gather evidence from the @entity61 estate where @entity1 and his family was massacred by a suspected assassin delayed reaction : several hours after police arrived on scene , mr @entity66 's four - year - old daughter @entity117 was found alive huddling under her mother 's legs inside the car crime scene : @entity6 gendarme police escort the car involved in the shooting of the @entity68 family away from the area but 15 spent , automatic pistol cartridges were found at the scene			1
‘ it was clearly an act of extreme savagery and it was obvious that whoever did this wanted to kill , ’ said @entity6 prosecutor @entity132			2
if mr @entity66 ’s family were deliberately targeted , police will want to establish how the killer knew where they were			0
did he wait outside their campsite before ambushing them in the countryside ? the @entity22 - born @entity68 businessman ’s commercial activities and political affiliations in his homeland will also be key lines of inquiry			1
the bodies being taken away from the scene in a private ambulance escorted by police tragedy : @entity6 police on guard near the site of the brutal slaying @entity162 link : the home of @entity1 in @entity164 , @entity165 but @entity6 police , whose track record in investigating the murders of @entity68 nationals makes uncomfortable reading , would be foolish to rule out other possible explanations			1
already there has been speculation that the attack may have been a case of mistaken identity linked to drugs			0
another theory is that shots could have been fired during a bungled armed robbery , with the dead cyclist being a witness to the crime			0
reports suggest the same gang may have carried out previous attacks			0
another possibility is that the crimes were racially motivated , or that the gunman is mentally ill. the @entity6 prosecutor described the carnage as being like something seen in a film			0
in most crime movies , the killer is finally brought to justice			0
if this was a professional hit , it will be a serious challenge for the @entity6 police to live up to that script .			2

remote location at car park near @entity27 would mean few if any witnesses to the atrocity
killer could have been out of @entity6 within minutes of the murders on wednesday , possibly boarding a plane from @entity93 within two hours
he might also have known there were no security cameras in the area
@entity1 , a @entity217 - born businessman , who lived in @entity164 , @entity165 , was killed along with his wife @entity220 , his mother - in - law and a passing cyclist
his daughter @entity117 , four , managed to survive ordeal
her older sister , @entity227 , seven , found near car in *critical* condition after being hit three times over head with a blunt *instrument*
