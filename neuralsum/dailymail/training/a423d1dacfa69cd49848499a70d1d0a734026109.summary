@entity0 insists @entity2 manager @entity1 must copy sir @entity3 when it comes to stopping @entity5 when the two sides clash at the @entity7 on june 14			1
writing in his @entity11 blog , the former @entity9 midfielder claims the @entity12 is the best playmaker in the world			1
but he believes @entity9 showed how to deal with him when they deployed @entity15 in a man - marking role against @entity18 in the @entity19 in 2010			1
‘ give him time and space and he will destroy you			0
he ’s such a clever player and is so composed			0
if surrounded he ’ll lay it off			0
if he ’s got room he ’s devastating			0
' @entity2 have first - hand experience of @entity5 having lost to his @entity23 side in @entity35			1
@entity0 added : ‘ even though @entity2 ’s @entity35 game against @entity23 finished 0 - 0 , we paid nowhere near enough attention to him			1
@entity5 is not renowned for his athleticism , and he ’s 35 now , but that day he ran 11.58km , more than any @entity2 player			1
he also had more passes ( 131 ) than @entity2 ’s four starting midfielders			2
’ @entity0 recalls how @entity3 learned from his mistakes when @entity9 played @entity18 four years ago			1
man marking : @entity15 stopped @entity5 from performing when @entity9 played @entity18 tactics : sir @entity3 ( left ) masterminded @entity9 's win over @entity18 in 2010 ‘ in 2010 before @entity9 played @entity18 in the @entity19 , sir @entity3 gave very specific instructions on how to take care of @entity5			1
man - marking him was a huge part of our pre-game plan – i played against him when @entity18 beat us 3 - 0 at the @entity56 in 2007			0
we did n’t man - mark him			0
we learned , and it was painful , ' he said			0
‘ @entity15 was the perfect man for @entity5 in 2010 and never gave him kick ( in a 7 - 2 aggregate victory )			1
you could even see @entity5 getting frustrated and having little kicks out by the end			2
‘ @entity5 spoke about @entity63 in his book : " they ’d programmed him to stop me			2
his devotion to the task was almost touching			0
even though he was a famous player , he consented to being used as a guard dog			0
” ‘ for @entity76 , we need an ‘ @entity77 ’ – one @entity2 player designated to man - mark him			2
looking at the squad , @entity69 – a good defender who can nick the ball well – could be an option and would be a bold decision , one which gives @entity2 a creative outlet , and saddles @entity5 with defensive work			2
’ slow start : @entity23 were held to a draw by @entity24 in their friendly in @entity84 on wednesday			0
