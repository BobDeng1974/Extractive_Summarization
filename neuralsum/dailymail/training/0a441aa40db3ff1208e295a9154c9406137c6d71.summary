the cost of a hospital delivery in @entity2 has tripled since 1996 , averaging out at $ 9,775 for a vaginal delivery - the highest cost of any country in the world , according to a new analysis			1
a report by @entity9 for the @entity10 found that the average total price for pregnancy as well as newborn care is about $ 30,000 for vaginal delivery , and $ 50,000 for a c - section , with insurers paying out an average of $ 18,329 and $ 27,866 respectively			1
what 's more , @entity2 is uniquely expensive when it comes to childbirth ; in other developed countries , delivery is often cheap or even free , and post-birth care is significantly more extensive			1
the price of pregnancy : the cost of giving birth in a hospital in @entity2 has tripled since 1996 , averaging at $ 9,775 - the highest cost of any industrialized country in the world even insured women in the @entity2 pay out - of - pocket costs of $ 3,400 on average , compared to little or nothing 20 years ago			1
the difference in the cost of pregnancy and delivery between the @entity2 and other industrialized countries is staggering			1
in @entity2 , the average cost of a c - section delivery is $ 15,041 , compared to $ 6,441 in @entity40 and just $ 4,435 in the @entity41			1
and while pregnancy and childbirth is less expensive in other countries , that 's not to say it is any less comprehensive			0
indeed , in @entity48 , where women receive the same amount of high - tech maternity care as @entity2 , delivery is free at public hospitals			1
women here can also opt to pay a fee for private deliveries			0
in the @entity2 , insurance is supposed to cover childbirth , but the report found that 62per cent of women covered by private plans did not have coverage for prenatal costs			2
one issue , says @entity64 , an economist at the @entity65 , is that @entity2 ' pay individually for each service and pay more for the services we receive '			0
in other countries , like @entity73 , for instance , women are often charged a single fee for all the services provided during childbirth - from blood tests to an epidural			0
' if a woman wants acupuncture , an epidural or birth in water , that 's what she 'll get , ' said @entity85 , an assistant professor at @entity86 in @entity73			0
' in @entity73 , if a woman wants acupuncture , an epidural or birth in water , that 's what she 'll get ' but in the @entity2 , there is a separate fee for everything from an ultrasound to an epidural to an extra night in a private hospital room			2
indeed , one woman told the @entity10 that she ' decided to be more assertive about holding down costs ' when becoming pregnant with her second child			0
she only had one ultrasound , kept a list of all the medications she received , received no anesthesia and had a midwife deliver her baby			0
but when the bill came , it was still over $ 6,000			0
' even removing the placenta can be coded as a separate charge , ' notes the @entity10			1
and paying higher hospital fees does not ensure better health care ; a recent @entity117 report found that @entity2 has one of the highest rates of birth and infant death in the world			1
separate charges : in @entity2 , services like an epidural , an ultrasound , a blood test , and even placenta removal cost a fee			1
many other countries instead charge a flat fee for prenatal care and birth problems : the factors that contribute to @entity2 's higher cost are excessive testing and ultrasounds , overly ' medicalized ' deliveries and a tendency not to use midwives post-birth care for mothers also pales in comparison to other countries like @entity40 , where women often remain in hospital for several days after birth , recovering and learning how to breastfeed			1
in @entity2 , however , they are discharged after one or two days , since most insurance only covers that which is considered medically necessary			0
another factor that makes delivery less expensive in other countries is the frequency of midwives , who are used by only eight per cent of @entity2			2
by contrast , 68per cent of births in @entity41 and 45per cent of births in the @entity159 are attended by a midwife , who perform simple deliveries , do most of the prenatal examinations , and , according to the @entity10 , can charge less than $ 325 for an 11 - hour delivery			1
' making women choose whether they want to pay $ 1,000 for an epidural did n't seem right ' @entity2 also tend to have a preference for ' medicalized ' deliveries involving ivs , anesthesia , and more ultrasounds than may be necessary , all of which add up			2
what 's more , more than 30per cent of @entity2 women have c - sections or drug - induced labor - a far higher percentage than other developed countries			2
this frequency of c - sections is also ' far above rates that the @entity183 considers necessary '			0
some hospitals are trying to combat high costs by introducing all - inclusive flat rates for pregnancy , much like those in other developed countries			0
at @entity195 , for example , a public hospital in @entity191 , @entity192 , dr @entity193 charges uninsured patients a flat fee of $ 3,850 for vaginal delivery with or without an epidural , and $ 5,600 for a planned c - section			2
' making women choose during labor whether you want to pay $ 1,000 for an epidural , that did n't seem right , ' said dr @entity193 .			0

the average cost of a hospital delivery in @entity2 is $ 9,775 , the highest in the world
in @entity40 , delivery costs $ 3,541 , and in the @entity41 it is just $ *2,641*
many industrialized countries offer flat fees for prenatal care and delivery , but in @entity2 , there is a separate charge for everything from a blood test to removing the placenta
