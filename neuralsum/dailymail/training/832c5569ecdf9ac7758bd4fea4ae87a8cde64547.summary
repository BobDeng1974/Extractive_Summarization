by @entity1 reporter a dog left behind when his owners moved from their @entity6 home has undergone a dramatic transformation after being rescued by animal welfare workers and is almost unrecognizable from the pitiful pup he was just weeks ago			1
@entity11 and @entity12 were on their way back from rescuing three pit bulls when they spotted a small dog hiding under a trailer in @entity6 rough @entity19 area			1
the pair stopped to pick up the dog , which had long fur tangled into matted dreadlocks and was terrified of people			2
he had clearly not been cared for since , and his terror of people indicates at best , neglect and at worst , abuse			0
in a rescue captured on camera , @entity40 tries to tempt the dog , who has since been named @entity31 , with a hamburger but such is his terror , @entity31 runs from his rescuer , leading him on a chase around the neighborhood			1
' @entity12 and i jumped out of the car , and a couple of minutes later i got a leash around him ( i did take a couple of bites which is pretty rare for me ) , but the poor guy was just so scared , ' wrote @entity40 in a @entity69 post about @entity31			0
accepting his fate : @entity31 allows himself to be patted in the car on the way to the shelter haircut : carers had to shave off the huge knotted dreadlocks @entity31 's fur had become broken : @entity31 was shaking , sickly and refused to eat when he arrived at the shelter his yelps of terror as @entity40 captures him with a dog catcher 's pole are heartbreaking , but as @entity40 gently pats his little head , @entity31 's plaintive cries subside , and soon @entity12 is able to nurse him on her lap in the car			1
once they arrive back at @entity89 headquarters , the team has quite a job on their hands to groom the pup and choose to shave all of his fur off and start afresh			0
the newly shorn @entity31 looks nothing like the mangy , dirty dog from earlier , but he hangs his head and presses his little body into the wall , his spirit still broken			2
new friends : now @entity31 has been taken in by a foster carer and he 's become playful and care - free two bigger dogs have taken him under their wing , and @entity31 is looking and acting like a new dog all he needs is love : @entity31 is being cared for by a foster family , but he is still looking for a forever home he was shaking , sickly and refused to eat			1
the video cuts to @entity31 a few weeks later , though , when he has been taken in by a foster carer with two other dogs - and he has become a bouncing , playing , tail - wagging dog			2
his two new friends - pit bull mixes a lot bigger than him - seem enamored of their new little pal and with their help , @entity31 seems to be coming to the understanding that his old life is over			0
he 's currently looking for a forever home to make his transformation into happy , beloved pet complete			0
contact @entity124 for details on how to adopt @entity31 .			0

@entity127 abandoned in @entity6 's *dangerous* @entity19 area was terrified and his fur completely dreadlocked
locals say the dogs owners had moved a year earlier , leaving him behind
the pup , named @entity31 by carers , was rescued and has *slowly* *recovered* his spirits - but lost his dreads
he 's looking and acting like a new dog and now needs to be adopted by a loving family
