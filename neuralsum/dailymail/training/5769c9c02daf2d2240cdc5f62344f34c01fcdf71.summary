by @entity0 published : 13:42 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 13:49 est , 24 november 2013 a would - be multi-millionaire might lose their £ 12 million lottery prize if they do not claim the cash by wednesday			2
ironically , the winning ticket was bought in @entity6 , @entity7 , one of the poorest areas in @entity10			1
the prize is set to become the second highest unclaimed lottery win after no one claimed a £ 64 million euromillions prize in december last year			1
would - be multi-millionaire : a £ 12 million lottery prize is yet to be claimed and if the winner does not come forward by wednesday the money will be donated to charity the ticket was bought on may 31 but now , six months on , the wednesday 11pm deadline is looming for the winner			1
a @entity23 spokesman said they will be walking the @entity7 streets on monday in a last chance bid to find the winner			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we have not had a valid claim for this prize			0
‘ but we have had big prizes claimed at the last minute			0
’ the winning raffle number is @entity34			0
if it is not claimed by november 27 the money will go to charitable causes			0
but perhaps it is a blessing in disguise			0
recently couple @entity40 and @entity41 from @entity42 , @entity39 decided to split up after their £ 101 million lottery win because they argued over how to spread the @entity47 cash between their family and friends			2
blessing in disguise ? the unclaimed prize comes as couple @entity40 and @entity41 decided to split because they argued about how best to spend their £ 101 million lottery win the couple , who bought their winning ticket from a @entity61 store and got married in @entity62 following the windfall in december 2011 , went from living in a one bedroom flat to a £ 9 million mansion in @entity66 , as well as a flat in @entity68 's @entity67 , so mr @entity69 , 49 , can walk to the ground of his beloved @entity71			1
last year ’s unclaimed £ 64 million prize was donated to health , education and other charitable causes after @entity76 launched a desperate search for the winning ticket holder			1
@entity79 , a spokesman for @entity80 , said at the time : ' countless good causes will benefit from this unclaimed prize			2
' in theory , the £ 64 million unclaimed prize would fund over 6,000 minibuses to help kids with disabilities			1
deadline looming : the winning ticket was bought in @entity6 , @entity7 ( pictured ) , one of the poorest areas in @entity10 other lottery wins that were never claimed include £ 9.4 million on a ticket bought in @entity94 in july 2005 , £ 7million in @entity95 in 2004 and £ 6.9 million jackpot in @entity97 in 2007			1
in 2001 @entity98 , a purchasing manager from @entity99 , missed out on a jackpot of £ 3,011,065 after losing his ticket			0
using computer records , he was able to prove the winning ticket was his but @entity23 refused to pay out - since the rules state that the winner must have their ticket to claim their fortune			2
the decision sparked a national furore , with even the then prime minister @entity110 championing mr @entity98 ’s cause - but all in vain .			0

the winning ticket was bought in one of the poorest areas of @entity10
if unclaimed it will be the second highest lottery win to be lost
