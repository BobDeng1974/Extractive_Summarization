going to any major sporting event these days is a pricey affair			2
there ’s the cost of the ticket , getting to the venue and the all important souvenirs			0
that ’s not to mention keeping fed and watered all day			0
but it seems patrons at the masters can get themselves a decent meal for a reasonable price			1
you can get a taste of the south with a @entity17 or @entity16 for $ 3 — which is about £ 2.05			0
the masters is one few sporting events which offers food at reasonable prices for its punters shot of the day @entity25 nearly got off to the perfect start with a stunning shot at the par - five second			1
after a perfect tee shot , he pinged a fairway wood 280 yards onto the green			1
it trickled towards the hole and looked to be heading in for an albatross , but it lipped out at the last moment			0
it was a high point for @entity25 , though , who then made five bogeys in his next nine holes			1
new practice routine @entity40 ? @entity41 has enjoyed a resurgence of form in recent months and the secret of his success could be down to his unusual practice technique			1
the @entity47 was spotted on the driving range at @entity49 with a rubber band wrapped around his knees and standing well away from the ball ( 1 )			0
he then takes a run - up at the ball ( 2 ) , not dissimilar to that of @entity56 — a character from a comedy film whose own run - up technique would see him regularly drive the ball more than 400 yards			1
@entity41 ’s might not travel quite as far , but the drill obviously helps him keep his form and balance nicely ( 3 )			1
@entity64 's still a player at 79 , and with a career grand slam behind him , you might forgive @entity69 for putting his feet up			0
but the @entity70 is fit as a flea			0
after joining @entity73 and @entity74 as an honorary starter , he tweeted : time for a @entity77 takeover ? @entity78 has been the star and if the @entity80 native wins from here , he would claim @entity77 ’s 13th green jacket , more than any other @entity84 state			0
same old for @entity85 after a 68 on day one , a 74 in his second round was a disappointment for @entity89			0
he tweeted : lost and found @entity91 might have lost a touch of his genius in recent years , but he wo n’t be losing his putter any time soon — he has his name inscribed on it			2
and his precise practice sessions were clearly paying off as he finished with a 69 , a four - shot improvement on round one			1
@entity91 has his name inscribed on his putter and will hope it brings him luck going into the weekend 1.39 despite his best efforts , @entity91 could not match the white - hot putting of @entity78			2
the 21 - year - old has averaged 1.39 putts per hole , the best in the field .			2
