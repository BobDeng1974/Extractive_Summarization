is @entity0 back ? the problem with him is that you never can tell			1
for every lung - busting drive through the middle of midfield there is a lazy waft of the right boot and shrug of the shoulders			1
this game , however , hinged on a loitering run and swish into @entity15 ’s net , serving as a reminder that he still means business			0
the 31 - year - old was nowhere near his best and is an ever - increasing enigma , but one @entity22 know they must persevere with			1
the alternative - @entity23 alongside @entity24 - is unimaginative and one - paced			0
in keeping with this season thus far the @entity25 flitted in and out at @entity26			1
there were flashes - a lovely dinked ball from a standing start to almost present @entity31 with a golden opportunity - but also moments you sat and wondered whether this was really the same player who could have pipped @entity36 to the major @entity37 gong in may			1
@entity0 gave @entity22 the lead in their 2 - 0 win at @entity40 in the @entity37 on saturday @entity0 ( centre ) put @entity22 ahead with a majestic left - footed curler into the bottom corner in the 82nd minute @entity0 ( centre left ) is congratulated by his @entity22 team - mates ( right ) for his goal the death of his brother @entity48 earlier this year is bound to have had a lasting impact - it would on anyone			1
that tragedy can go a long way to suggesting why @entity0 is in and out , not looking himself			2
but the overt jostling for a summer move , with a birthday cake as a farcical by - product , means @entity0 has become an easy target for persistent criticism			1
some of it is undoubtedly unfair			0
city owe a lot to @entity0 , who has been a major reason why they have clinched two titles and are mixing it in @entity65			2
but those who question his desire appear to be doing so justifiably			0
@entity0 rarely breaks sweat and rarely gets himself into either box			2
the game can occasionally pass him by			0
the one saving grace at @entity26 is that he became more urgent as the clock ticked down			2
but his persistent dip in form is obviously becoming more than a passing concern for @entity76			0
a passenger for the majority and a stroke of genius to clinch it late on			0
despite his goal @entity0 was n't at his best for @entity22 against @entity40 on saturday evening the 31 - year - old ( centre ) still seems a shadow of himself from last season @entity0 's heat map shows the @entity22 midfielder did n't break into the @entity40 box once @entity0 did the basics well at @entity26 - highlighted by his 90.1 per cent passing accuracy during the match @entity0 did the basics well , helping out his back four to good effect , but did n’t seem to be the key to unlock stubborn resistance yet again			1
that was summed up midway through the second half when - 25 yards from goal - he aimlessly clipped a ball into the box without thought			2
he then inexplicably over-hit a routine ball for @entity107			0
the shoulders slumped , the head went down			0
in keeping with his curious way , @entity0 then drove with purpose at goal and almost passed an effort beyond @entity15 to set @entity22 on their way			1
so where do we stand with him ? nobody quite knows			0
the @entity25 international ( right ) looked lethargic when the hosts broke quickly on the counter-attack @entity0 ( left ) gets tackled by on loan @entity40 midfielder @entity121 ( right ) during a mixed display			1

@entity22 beat @entity40 2 - 0 in their @entity37 clash
@entity0 gave @entity22 the lead in the 82nd minute at @entity26
@entity0 had a mixed *performance* in midfield for the champions
despite the goal , the 31 - year - old looked lethargic at times in midfield
