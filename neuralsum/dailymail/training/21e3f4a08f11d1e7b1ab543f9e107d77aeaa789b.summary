shift : in what used to be a crime more associated with drug addicts bent on feeding their habits , street gangs are increasingly turning their sights on residential break ins as a source of cash ' initial information suggests suspects are increasingly young people from the local area associating with gangs and highly organised and mobile suspects who are operating across a number of boroughs , ' said @entity27 's report			1

' worrying ' : @entity27 councillor @entity68 , who commissioned the research , said gangs were turning to crime on their own doorstep ' the robberies are affecting people 's lives with many feeling vulnerable because of the gangs and their anti-social behaviour			1
' what concerns me is that gang members never used to commit crimes on their doorstep but that is what seems to be happening now			1
' these gangs are all about defending their own postcodes , i have two gangs in my ward who can not travel between their two estates			1
