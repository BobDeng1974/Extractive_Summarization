by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is confident he will get a sympathetic ear from @entity5 owner @entity4 as the pair attempt to find a way forward			1
the two men are meeting this week to carry out a debrief after a difficult season and decide on a summer transfer strategy , although their discussions are far from showdown talks			1
both men have come under fire from disgruntled fans in recent weeks , but in the short term at least , there appears to be no prospect of either going anywhere			2
@entity2 knows he has challenging questions to answer after a campaign of two halves , but insists the annual get - together is far from confrontational			1
staying on : @entity2 will remain as @entity5 's manager for next season after achieving a top 10 finish unwanted : @entity5 fans want @entity2 sacked after amassing just 16 points in 19 league games for 2014 he said : ' i think it 's important he understands some of the problems i have had			1
we can talk through some things i think need to improve			2
' although he has a reputation of being aggressive , he 's a better listener			0
that 's why he has had such great success			0
' he does n't really say much			0
he listens and comes back to me , sometimes 48 hours after , and draws some conclusions from what i have said			0
' it 's not like there 's too much hollering and shouting , it 's more a case for @entity4 to listen to the problems i have had			1
' then he reflects on the budget and everything else to see how he can help me			0
' let 's hear it : owner @entity4 is a good listener , says @entity2 poor : @entity5 ended the season with a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity57 thanks to @entity58 ( right ) winner @entity2 needs significant help this summer with a replacement for midfielder @entity62 and a complete rebuild of the striking department the priorities			1
@entity62 's departure for @entity66 in january and the failure to replace him were the central factors in a second - half collapse , and plugging that gap will be key			0
however it is up front where @entity2 , chief scout @entity73 and newly - appointed managing director @entity74 face their biggest challenge			1
@entity77 spent last season on loan at @entity80 from @entity81 and the prospect of securing a permanent deal has receded in recent months			0
@entity84 joined him from @entity85 in january on a similar basis and failed to make a significant impression , while long - serving @entity89 international @entity88 is out of contract an unlikely to be handed an extension			0
there will be other vacancies too with @entity94 set to join @entity95 and the likes of @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 having become peripheral figures as the season drew to a close			2
the success or otherwise of the mission to plug those gaps could go a long way towards determining whether or not the @entity107 can win over supporters , whose patience has worn critically thin after two transfer windows during which not a single permanent signing was made .			2

@entity5 finished 10th in the @entity113
@entity2 is set to keep his job as @entity117 boss
he will meet with @entity4 and managing director @entity74 to press ahead with transfer plans
