by @entity0 scientists hope to send the first humans to @entity3 by 2025 , but as it currently stands , anyone who takes a roundtrip mission to the red planet would be exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation			0
experts estimate that the radiation would be enough to increase an astronaut ’s lifetime risk of developing fatal cancer by more than three per cent			2
other risks faced during long - term spaceflights include blindness and bone loss from the microgravity environment			1
astronauts who takes a roundtrip mission to the red planet would be exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation , according to @entity24 now a panel of scientists is urging @entity24 to draft a clear set of ethical rules to ensure the health of astronauts on long - duration flights , according to @entity32			2
a report from the @entity35 's @entity34 ( @entity34 ) argues that guidelines on exceptions to @entity24 ’s current health standards are needed			2
‘ from its inception , space exploration has pushed the boundaries [ of human endurance ] and risked the lives and health of astronauts , ’ @entity39 , chair of the @entity34 committee , said in a statement			0
experts estimate that the radiation exposure on a trip to the red planet would be enough to increase an astronaut ¿ s lifetime risk of developing fatal cancer by more than three per cent avoid harm by preventing harm , exercising caution , and removing or mitigating harms that occur a mission must provide benefits to society seek a favourable and acceptable balance of risk of harm and potential for benefit respect autonomy by allowing individual astronauts to make voluntary decisions regarding participation in proposed missions ensure fair processes and provide equality of opportunity for mission participation and crew selection recognise fidelity and the individual sacrifices made for the benefit of society by offering health care and protection for astronauts during missions and over the course of their lifetimes			1
‘ determining where those boundaries lie and when to push the limits is complex			0
@entity24 will continue to face decisions as technologies improve , and longer and farther spaceflights become feasible			0
’ the report says that ethical principles should include finding a balance between risk of harm and potential benefit to the society			1
it adds that @entity24 should offer health care and protection for astronauts during missions and over the course of their lifetimes			1
according to @entity24 , a mission to the red planet would take several years to complete and , during which time , astronauts would face health risks from cosmic rays and energetic particles from the sun. both types of radiation can damage dna and increase the risk of an astronaut developing cancer			1
on current missions in low - earth orbit , astronauts are protected from the most harmful effects of the radiation as a result of @entity126 's magnetic field			0
this creates a shield around the planet that deflects much of the radiation			0
in deep space , however , astronauts will be without this protection			0
‘ astronauts put their lives and health at great risk for their country and humankind , ’ said dr @entity39			0
‘ our report builds on @entity24 ’s work and confirms the ethical imperative to protect astronauts ' health , while fulfilling the agency 's mission of exploration			1
’ other risks on a mission to @entity3 include vision impairment and bone loss from the microgravity environment			1

trip to @entity3 would increase astronaut 's risk of developing cancer by 3 *%*
other risks include vision impairment and bone loss *due* to microgravity
report says @entity24 must balance risk of harm and potential benefit
it adds that space agency should offer health care for astronauts during missions and over the course of their lifetimes
