@entity1 worker @entity0 with the £ 80,000 bags this may not be a question you 've ever asked yourself , but how much would you be prepared to pay for a money safe shaped like a gorilla ? a tenner ? £ 100 ? what do you mean they 'd have to pay you to take the monstrosity home ? would it make a difference to discover that the gorilla is solid silver , hand - crafted by some of the finest silversmiths in the land , and on sale in a shop that epitomises the ' if you have to ask the price , you ca n't afford it ' ethos ? the actor @entity26 fell in love with this , er , unusual piece on a trip to @entity31			1
it is n't known if he paid the full price ( celebrities often do n't ) , but for a mere mortal to take it home would cost an eye - watering £ 55,000			1
the price of a solid silver gorilla safe is just one of the life lessons you learn from watching a jaw - dropping documentary that goes behind the scenes at @entity1 , the jewellery and gift store to the rich and famous			1
one customer , who comes in to buy handbags , expresses an interest in some rings as she 's about to leave			1
a particularly sparkling little gem is placed on her finger			2
the price ? £ 4.6 million			1
that she does n't have a heart attack tells you everything you need to know about the clientele			2
a bona fide @entity61 institution , @entity1 can trace its history back to 1781 and has been a presence on upmarket new @entity64 since 1847			1
it 's held a @entity66 from every @entity61 monarch since @entity69 @entity68 awarded it one in 1862 , and everyone from @entity71 to the @entity72 has been a customer			2
and at one point the joke went that the @entity75 was the only customer , so lavish were his spending sprees there			2
the last time @entity80 popped in it was because he needed a couple of dozen wine glasses for a party			2
not that ' need ' is a word much associated with @entity1			1
who ' needs ' a solid silver cocktail shaker shaped like a rocket ( £ 7,500 ) , or a stag 's head decanter – an @entity1 bestseller at £ 2,500 ? ' it 's not a case of " i need one			1
" it 's a case of " i want one , " ' says one staff member			2
' and what people are buying is exclusivity			2
' the staff are upfront about the fact that prices are n't emblazoned all over the shop			1
mostly you need a magnifying glass to find one			2
one salesman talks about how you sell a champagne bath ( it 's a big bucket , basically )			2
it seems you do n't scream about how it costs £ 30,000 , you point out how long it took to make , and how it is a unique piece			1
by the time the question of ' how much ? ' comes up , he says , the customer is likely to think , ' that 's just the thing for my yacht			0
' in an age of mass - market consumerism , @entity1 is something of a relic			1
it 's still the place to go in certain circles for gifts though , and it 's never too young to start			0
one can quite imagine @entity129 and @entity130 practically moving in when they were doing up the nursery			0
a solid silver baby hairbrush will set you back £ 265 ( although you 'd probably want the matching comb – £ 185 – too , so as not to look like a cheapskate )			1
an egg cup shaped like a rocking horse costs £ 495 , while a little tube to hold a birth certificate is £ 675			1
aspreys £ 55,000 @entity142 purchased by @entity26 the company made its name making intricate gilded travel cases for the discerning			1
the manufacturing process involved heating mercury to extreme temperatures – at which point it gives off deadly fumes			0
dying on the job was an occupational hazard , and the average lifespan of the @entity1 craftsmen , back in the day , was just 41			1
these days the craftsmen and women who toil in the workshops may have dwindled to just a handful ( due to a lack of demand rather than mercury poisoning ) , but they 're still responsible for making and mending some of the world 's most iconic pieces , including the @entity165			0
watching them at work is awe - inspiring , and as a lament to the lost world of the @entity61 master craftsman this programme is as powerful as it gets			0
it can take months , even years , to craft some items , but in the modern world these are no longer skills that are valued			0
one silversmith is filmed cleaning the toilets			0
his services doing the job he trained for were no longer required			0
another , @entity183 , is filmed nervously stepping onto the shopfloor in his overalls , to hand over a necklace that will retail at £ 133,000			1
' i 'm a scruffy urchin			0
i feel out of place , ' he says			0
alas for the purists the market for near - priceless trinkets has evolved and the customers targeted today are likely to be film stars and footballers with an eye for the eccentric			0
@entity199 and @entity200 even designed a range of jewellery for them called @entity204 in 2009			0
a bangle from @entity199 and @entity200 's collection , £ 10,500 the fact that cameras have been allowed in for the first time shows that things are changing			1
once @entity1 was a byword for discretion and quiet opulence			1
but the company has had its share of tribulations in recent years			0
its own financial history is chequered ; the firm posted losses of £ 10 million in the mid- 90s			1
the latest financial figures are healthier following a £ 50 million refurbishment by @entity222 and a surge in demand from @entity226 customers			1
the programme does n't flinch from showing the challenges of keeping a company like @entity1 afloat			1
an extraordinary project – the sale of 41 bespoke handbags – is launched while the cameras are there			0
these are off - the - scale high - end bags , some made from crocodile skin with 18 - carat gold fittings and encrusted with diamonds			0
the most expensive is £ 80,000			1
special events are arranged to try to flog these handbags			0
high teas are laid on , but the sandwiches and macaroons remain uneaten			0
treasured clients are invited but fail to turn up			0
after one month , only a couple of the bags have sold			0
@entity250 , the salesman charged with shifting them , starts to sweat			1
he works on commission , has a small child at home , and is now worried about having one of his ' bread and water months '			0
we cheer for him when a @entity261 princess swoops in at the last minute and buys a dozen			0
in some ways the programme lifts the lid on a preposterous world			0
there 's a @entity269 tourist who 's with a salt and pepper set shaped like @entity271			0
yes , yes , it looks as hideous as it sounds , but she absolutely wo n't hear of leaving without it			0
the price ? £ 6,995			2
one @entity277 gentleman is warmly greeted – hardly surprisingly , since we learn he comes three or four times a year			0
he 's looking for a watch and when he 's told the price of the one he likes is £ 85,000 he buys two			2
will it make you wish your husband was the sort to pop into @entity1 and ask them to help him choose your birthday gift ? yes and no. the gentleman who does this asks the saleswoman to model some earrings for him so he can choose			1
it 's not a service you get in @entity297 , granted , but some might find it a bit , well , weird that while the birthday girl 's earrings may have cost £ 15,750 , they 've also been in someone else 's ears			2
