he said : ' i stepped out of the vehicle and @entity7 went to get out			1
' i then heard a shot and looked around and realised something was wrong			0
@entity7 was standing by the @entity12 door , he turned to look at me and let out a groaning sound			1
' @entity7 then slipped and was lying on his back			2
i asked him where he had been hit but he did not respond , so i put him in the recovery position and went to get help			0
' tribute : these flowers were left on farmland in @entity18 where mr @entity7 is believed to have accidentally shot himself during the hunt desperate : mr @entity7 's friend ran to a nearby house to call the emergency services but paramedics could not save him after the gun went off mr @entity15 ran to a nearby house and the homeowner dialled 999 but paramedics were unable to save mr @entity7 , who died at the scene shooting expert @entity52 told the hearing that mr @entity7 probably accidentally killed himself during the incident on april 5			1
he said : ' i fired the firearm a number of times during testing and found the trigger pull was lighter than expected , at 500g , but not necessarily dangerous			0
' i was called to examine mr @entity7 ’s @entity62 boot that had a zipper , which was near the top , more or less done up and sticking out at 90 degrees			1
' i carried out a series of tests , rubbing the rifle up against the boot , and found it was possible for the zip to engage with the handle and fire the gun			0
sad : @entity73 near the family home in @entity75 , @entity76 where the couple lived with their two children , said they had been married for under a year and mrs @entity81 was ' inconsolable ' at losing her ' soul mate ' ' i have come across similar incidents with police or the soldier equipment where triggers have been caught , but i have not come across this before			1
' recording a verdict of accident death , @entity88 , coroner for mid and north @entity19 , said : ' mr @entity7 was clearly an experienced sportsman and rifle shot , who was safety conscious			1
' he had no worries or problems and had simply gone out hunting with his friend			2
' the accident happened within moments of him getting out of the @entity12 to take a shot			0
' what i am left with following the reconstruction is the trigger was accidentally activated by the zip			0
liked : friends said mr @entity7 was a ' happy go lucky guy ' ' that explains the entry point and the path of the bullet			1
it ’s plausible and fits the evidence			0
the path of the bullet also followed the tragic set of circumstances			0
