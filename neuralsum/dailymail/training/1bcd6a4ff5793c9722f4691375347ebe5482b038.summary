an oil rig worker who was notoriously fired for saying he believed he saw @entity3 ' come down ' today insisted he thinks the official search for the @entity7 jet is happening in the wrong place			1
in his first detailed interview since he sent out an email to officials relaying what he thought might be the @entity14 aircraft , @entity15 , 57 , told @entity17 : ' almost a year has passed , but i stand by what i saw			1
' i 've thought about it and thought about it , over and over and while i can not say for certain that the burning object in the sky was definitely @entity3 , the timing fits in with when the @entity7 plane lost contact			1
i have been trying to disprove that what i saw was the aeroplane ever since			0
' and so far he has failed to disprove it			0
speaking at his @entity32 home where he now sits out his days after losing his job as a result of sending out the email on his company computer on the rig off the south of @entity39 , mr @entity15 said that everyone believed he had said with certainty that he saw @entity3 crash in flames into the @entity44			1
' unfortunately my words were misinterpreted			0
i was careful to say that i ' believed ' i saw the aircraft come down			2
the email was never for public consumption			0
grieving : mr @entity15 spoke to @entity17 as a group of relatives of @entity52 passengers arrived in @entity7 from @entity53 on february 12 to demand answers from @entity55 and the government mr @entity15 said he has spent many months pondering what he had seen - and remains unmoved in his opinion that if he had observed a burning plane it must have gone down in the @entity44 ' and if it was the plane that has been missing for so long , then the search in the southern @entity62 is clearly in the wrong place			1
' mr @entity15 was speaking after a group of relatives of @entity52 passengers who were on the plane arrived in @entity7 from @entity53 to demand answers from @entity55 and the government			1
among their demands was an answer to why the @entity7 government had announced recently that the fate of @entity3 was an accident			1
mr @entity15 told @entity17 he was in no position to say what had caused the object to burst into flames , but added : ' if it was mh370 i can not imagine how it could have continued flying			1
it could only have come down in the @entity44			0
' he had gone to bed on the oil rig @entity86 , located off the coast of the @entity39 town of @entity89 , at his usual time of around 7pm			0
' i got up at around midnight @entity91 , which is one hour ahead of @entity7 time , and wandered around to an area at the back as usual for a cigarette and a coffee			1
it was a beautiful night with good visibility because it had been raining , which always tends to clear the air			0
' it would have been some time after 1am ( @entity102 ) that i saw a sudden glow of fire above the horizon , which caught my immediate attention , although , of course i could not have known whether it was definitely an aircraft or not			0
' mr @entity15 said he took no immediate action but when he learned the following day that @entity3 was missing - when it should have flown on across southern @entity39 towards @entity53 - he tried in vain to contact @entity7 and @entity39 officials			1
sighting : @entity15 had gone to bed on the oil rig @entity86 ( pictured ) , located off the coast of the @entity39 town of @entity89 , on the evening of march 7 last year at his usual time of around 7pm on march 12 - three days after his sighting - he sent out an email to @entity39 officials declaring : ' i believe i saw the @entity55 plane come down			1
' he described where he was writing from and gave his latitude and longitude bearings			0
he then added : ' i observed ( the plane ? ) burning at high altitude on a compass bearing of 265 degrees to 275 degrees from our surface location			0
' he went on : ' while i observed the burning ( plane ) it appeared to be in one piece â€¦ ' from when i first saw the burning ( plane ) until the flames went out ( still at high altitude ) was 10 - 15 seconds			0
there was no lateral movement , so it was either coming toward our location , stationary ( falling ) or going away from our location			0
' the general position of the object , he said , was south west of the normal flight paths of aircraft he and his co-workers saw every day and at a lower altitude than the normal flight paths			0
mr @entity15 , who has worked in the oil and gas exploration industry for more than 30 years , said that since he was ' kicked off ' the rig after his email went public and the computers became overloaded he has spent many months pondering what he had seen - and remains unmoved in his opinion that if he had observed a burning plane it must have gone down in the @entity44			1
evidence : mr @entity163 , whose son was on the flight , said the @entity7 government had no facts or legal basis for announcing what had happened to the plane ' there 's a lot about this whole affair that niggles me and i 've considered numerous questions as to whether there has been a cover up or there has been a show of inefficiency			1
i learned that @entity7 military had picked up a possible signal over @entity183 ( an island off the west coast of the @entity7 peninsular ) but did n't report it immediately			1
' of course , if it was from the plane , it means that contrary to my belief that it had come down in the @entity44 it had managed to turn around and fly back across the mainland			0
' but what has also annoyed me is the fact that the @entity39 searchers were stood - down after performing one flight based on my observation before the whole search effort was moved to the other side of the peninsular			1
' asked if he had a theory about what might have caused the fire , he said an incident that came to mind was an explosion in a similar aircraft that was on a runway at @entity209 in 2011 , which was caused by oxygen escaping from disabled tubing and catching fire			0
mr @entity15 has n't worked since losing his job			1
' there 's nothing out there			2
the price of oil has dropped below break - even in many places , so a lot of the upcoming projects have been shelved			0
' because he did not want to become the centre of that circus , he laid low - but that then placed him at the centre of another controversy			0
bloggers questioned why he had ' gone into hiding ' while others suggested he did not even exist and that his entire email was a hoax			0
the official search , headed by @entity233 , is based on satellite readings which picked up pings from what was believed to have been @entity3 accident : relatives of passengers of @entity3 held placards during a protest demanding to know why the @entity7 government had announced recently that the fate of @entity3 was an accident he ignored the international controversy and went to a police station in @entity32 where he filed a report about his sighting			1
police have agreed that he was treated as a credible witness			0
in @entity7 on friday , a group of mainly @entity52 relatives have arrived at @entity256 airport wearing red t - shirts bearing the slogan ' pray for @entity3 '			1
they said they had come for answers and unfurled banners and placards , one of which read : ' today it 's us , tomorrow it could be you			2
' @entity271 , wife of one of the 239 passengers and crew on board the aircraft which lost contact on march 8 , said the group had three main purposes for making the journey			2
they wanted to have a meeting with @entity55 officials and glean the latest information			2
they also wanted to know on what grounds the @entity287 had described the disappearance as ' an accident '			2
and finally , said ms @entity271 , they wanted to discuss financial matters with the airline in the hope that families who were facing difficulties could be helped			0
mr @entity163 , whose son was on the flight , said the @entity7 government had no facts or legal basis for announcing what had happened to the plane ' there are no facts or legal basis for @entity7 to announce that @entity3 was an accident and that all passengers were killed			1
. it does n't have any legal standing , ' he told @entity309			0
' it 's been nearly a year since the flight went missing and the families are suffering financial problems because we 've been travelling to various places - including to here and to the family assistance centre in @entity53 and we 've spent a lot of money			1
' the families are facing financial issues as much as emotional ones			0
we want @entity55 and @entity14 to provide immediate payments to help us with these issues			2
' all the relatives of the passengers have been trying to find out what happened to them			2
' mr @entity15 's observation might be a clue - or might not , for he has only been able to relate what he saw			1
but many @entity52 relatives continue to insist that there has been a cover - up for unknown reasons as the fruitless search goes on in the southern @entity62			1
the @entity336 , which , headed by @entity233 , is conducting the search says that so far the underwater operations have scoured 22,000 square kilometres of the ocean bed , equalling around 36 per cent of the priority search area			2
it is estimated that if there are no delays with vessels , equipment or from the weather , the underwater search will be mostly finished some time in may			2
the ' go @entity349 ' supply ship has remained in the area , 2,500km to the south west of @entity352 , western @entity233 , but three vessels involved in the underwater search have this week suspended operations to return to port in @entity233 for scheduled visits			2
despite months of searching in the area , there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far .			0

@entity15 , 57 , from @entity367 has spoken exclusively to @entity17
he believes search is happening thousands of miles in the wrong direction
official search is based on pings from what 's believed to have been @entity3
