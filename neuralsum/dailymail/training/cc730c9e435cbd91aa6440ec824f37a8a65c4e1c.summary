a female dominatrix has revealed all about her extreme behaviour to two therapists investigating @entity4 's sexual taboos			1
@entity5 , 32 , from @entity6 , allows men to indulge in a number of fetishes which they would normally never admit to for fear of judgement			1
she explains : ' @entity14 domination is where you are chastising men and disciplining them			1
it 's quite an embarrassing , taboo subject to go down that road so they come to specialist services - to women like myself			2
she explains : ' i might have them cleaning or lock them away in a cupboard and not let them out till they 've paid me money , it 's all designed to belittle them			0
' most shocking of all , @entity5 will even agree to tie up and ' rape ' her clients - having consensual sex while role playing an attack			1
@entity25 admitted she gets perverse pleasure from being mean and abusive to her willing ' victims '			0
she agreed to undergo regression therapy with @entity58 and @entity59 to get to the root of her unusual sexual behaviour			1
the pair are researching the nation 's sexual taboos to understand why people are compelled to behave in such a way			1
@entity25 said some of her clients want to be locked in a cupboard and she wo n't let them out till they pay her the dominatrix shares her story with therapists @entity58 , left , and @entity59 , right , in a bid to get to the root of her unusual sexual behaviour @entity59 , 29 , from @entity6 , uses hypnotherapy and regression to help people understand why their childhood - and , he believes , past lives - can cause them to commit acts that others find shocking and sickening and that are sometimes even illegal			1
he says his treatments can unlock memories and emotions from the sub-conscious that people were not consciously aware of			0
in @entity25 's case , he said : ' her childhood has played a huge role in explaining her dominatrix behaviour			1
' during treatment , which was recorded by film maker @entity90 , @entity25 reveals to @entity59 memories she has tried to forget concerning incidents when she was abused in her youth			1
she recalls how she was just seven when a boy her age with learning difficulties tried to have sex with her			0
in another memory , she recalls being touched inappropriately by a 68 - year - old gp			0
@entity25 explains to @entity58 how belittling men as a dominatrix makes her feel powerful when she has past life regression , she sees herself as a strong and dominant male in the 1700s			1
@entity25 admits that her past experiences have led her to want to be dominant and in control and she has channelled this in her sexual activity			1
she said : ' once i got into this job , i realised fem domination was taking me into that sexual side of my desire that i always wanted			2
' i was abused by men for a long time so it makes me feel good , i can abuse them back and attack what i felt for years			1
' dating coach @entity58 said she and @entity59 were keen to help people like @entity25 who often do n't have anyone to talk to about their taboo activities			0
as a result of her sessions with @entity58 and @entity59 , @entity25 said she feels better about her life and her past			2
the 32 - year - old says she feels happier and more confidence following her sessions with @entity58 and @entity59 she said : ' since october when i came for the session , i 've noticed it has instilled a lot of confidence within myself			1
i feel at ease and empowered to speak out more openly about who i am , i 'm no longer willing to shy away from society			0
' also it has helped my body image issues , i 've managed to lose half my body weight , around 5 stone since then , which i feel was connected with emotions i was carrying			0
i have clarity of who i am and no longer seek validation			0
' she added : ' it has not changed my sexual behaviour as such but instead of seeing lots of men i 'm just seeing the one			1
i 'm still indulging in my dominatrix acts but with just one man			2
it 's an unconventional relationship			0
' @entity58 and @entity59 said of their work with her : ' to be honest nothing could have prepared us for meeting @entity5 , who is amazing - warm , open , funny , shocked by nothing and generally has a larger than life personality			1
which is incredible considering what @entity5 has been through as we found out through our session			1
@entity58 and @entity59 have been shocked by some of the stories they have heard as they investigate taboos ' we feel as thought the session has shed light of where she has come from , as that shapes who she is today			0
it all makes sense to us			0
we feel that dealing with old emotions would help her be more content with herself , find clarity and just be a peace			0
' @entity58 and @entity59 began meeting people in early 2014 with sexual behaviours that were considered taboo , unacceptable or illegal - like zoophilia ( arousal through inflicting pain on or seeing animals in pain ) , necrophilia ( sexual attraction or intercourse with a corpse ) and incest			2
more than 60 people ( mostly men ) were willing to share their behaviour and background story with the pair			1
@entity58 , 41 , from @entity191 , said : ' there must be a underlying reason to why people perform certain extreme forced or consensual sexual activities that deepened my interest in understanding taboos better			2
' i guess i 'm lucky that i had a good upbringing and was never exposed to such things however i do feel childhood experiences and even porn plays a role as it can put ideas into people 's mind and influence them			2
as a dating coach who deals with relationships everyday , i was keen to explore extreme behaviors and work with @entity59			0
' @entity59 added : ' as a therapist , i 've heard it all but these extreme sexual revelations were at times truly stomach churning as they do n't conform to acceptable behaviour			1
' just when i thought i had heard it all something else would come along to pull the rug under my feet			0
the most shocking story was of brother - sister incest who were adopted at birth and met later in life , it really challenged my ability to stay neutral			0
i was keen to understand the ' whys ' to these behaviours , that understanding childhood / adolescent experiences became a focal point of our journey			0
' tackling another taboo : earlier this week , @entity58 appeared on this morning to demonstrate a ' vagina facial ' @entity58 said the investigations are deepening her understanding of human behaviour and she hopes it allows people with perverse inclinations to change their behaviour if it is harming themselves or others or breaking the law			2
it 's not just sexual taboos that @entity58 is currently investigating			2
she also caused a stir this week when she appeared on this morning to reveal her recipe for a ' vagina facial '			0
she revealed how a lotion she has developed using @entity251 cream , honey , egg white and coconut oil can make women look and feel younger below when applied regularly			2
three brave women agreed to try the treatment live on the @entity259 show .			0
