by @entity0 for @entity1 these heart - warming images show the extraordinary lengths one nurse has gone to in her campaign to care for cats dying of leukemia			1
@entity8 , 45 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , has turned her two - story , eight - room apartment into a feline hospice housing 175 patients and spends a staggering $ 1,785 a month on their care			1
the mother - of - three meticulously doses out medicine while also regularly treating the cats for parasites - she even knits them shirts and jumpers to wear when it gets chilly			1
the cluttered apartment is totally consumed by cat litters , food and water bowls - leaving barely enough room to walk around			2
to make her life easier , friends have suggested she care for healthy cats instead but ms @entity8 insists she is doing the right thing			2
she said : ' that 's not my role			0
my duty is to the cats that nobody cares about			0
people do n't adopt adult cats , especially if they are terminally ill. ' the cat boxes and heavy use of deodorants fail to mask the powerful odour of urine , but ms @entity8 said her neighbors have not yet complained ( pictured - one of ms @entity8 's children naps with the sick cats ) many street cats in @entity9 turn out to have the disease , as well as fleas , parasites and malnutrition for five years she has nursed unwanted strays as they slowly succumb to the common , fatal retrovirus , which is not contagious to humans or other species			1

she said she gives out medicine , sterilizes the animals and treats them for parasites every two months			0
her arms bear the scratches of cats that resist the injections			0
the nurse spends around $ 1,785 a month on care for the cats - half of that amount coming from donations , the other half her own modest wages			1
the nurse lovingly holds a sick cat as she reaches into her medicine cabinet she claims ' my best gift of love and respect i give them in life ' despite using strong deodorants , the apartment gives off an overpowering smell of urine but ms @entity8 said her neighbors have not yet complained			1
