an ancient bright blue pigment first used 5,000 years ago is giving modern scientists clues toward the development of new nanomaterials that could be the basis for futuristic gadgets			1
@entity6 blue , one of the first pigments known to man , has potential uses in state - of - the - art medical imaging devices , television remote controls and other telecommunications technology , new research claims			1
regarded as humanity 's first synthetic pigment , it was used in paintings on tombs , statues , papyrii and other objects throughout the ancient @entity25 world			0
hieroglyphics from the @entity27 : the wall paintings in this tomb use @entity6 blue , considered humanity 's first synthetic pigment , which new research shows could be used in new nanomaterials considered humanity 's first synthetic pigment , @entity6 blue was used by the @entity6 for thousands of years			1
the term for it in the @entity6 language is hsbd - iryt , which means artificial lapis lazuli , revealing the ancients obsession with the precious stone , which they prized for its rarity and stark blue colour			2
its characteristic blue colour , resulting from one of its main components — copper — ranges from a light to a dark hue , depending on differential processing and composition			2
the earliest evidence for the use of @entity6 blue is in the @entity54 ( c.2575 - 2467 bc ) and in the @entity55 ( 2050 - 1652 bc ) , it continued to be in the decoration of tombs , wall paintings , furnishings and statues by the @entity61 ( 1570 – 1070 bc ) , @entity6 blue began to be more widely used in the production of numerous objects			1
the pigment was known to the @entity65 by the name caeruleum			0
@entity67 describes in his work @entity69 architectura how it was produced by grinding sand , copper and natron and heating the mixture , shaped into small balls , in a furnace			0
@entity77 is necessary for the production as well , but probably lime - rich sand was used			0
after the @entity82 era , @entity80 fell from usage and the manner of its creation was forgotten			0
however , after the end of the @entity82 era , @entity6 blue fell into disuse and the secrets of its creation were forgotten			1
but now researchers from the @entity90 have found that @entity6 blue can be rolled into nanosheets so thin that thousands would fit across the width of a human hair			1
not only that , but the sheets produce invisible infra - red radiation similar to the beams that communicate between remote controls and @entity98 , car door locks and other telecommunications devices			1
known to chemists as calcium copper silicate , remnants of @entity6 blue been found on the @entity105 's statue of the messenger goddess @entity106 and in the famous pond in a @entity108 in the tomb of @entity6 ' scribe and counter of grain ' @entity112 in @entity114 , amongst other places			1
the ancient @entity6 held the colour blue in very high regard and were eager to present it on many media and in a variety of forms			2
the earliest evidence for the use of @entity6 blue is in the @entity54 ( c.2575 - 2467 bc )			1
it appears on limestone sculptures from that period , as well as being shaped into a variety of cylinder seals and beads			0
in the @entity55 ( 2050 - 1652 bc ) , it continued to be used as a pigment in the decoration of tombs , wall paintings , furnishings and statues and by the @entity61 ( 1570 – 1070 bc ) , began to be more widely used in the production of numerous objects			0
the @entity65 knew it by the name caeruleum , and @entity67 describes in his work @entity141 how it was produced by grinding sand , copper and natron and heating the mixture , shaped into small balls , in a furnace			0
marble statue of @entity106 from the @entity105 , @entity150 : use of @entity6 blue , of which traces were found on this statue continued until the fourth century @entity154 , when the secret to its manufacture was lost apart from @entity6 , it has also been found in the @entity158 , the @entity25 and at the limits of the @entity65			2
although undoubtedly an @entity6 invention , it is unclear as to whether its existence elsewhere was a result of parallel inventions or whether its technology had spread to these areas			2
its use continued throughout the late period , and @entity171 , only dying out in the fourth century @entity154 , when the secret to its manufacture was lost			0
it was only at the beginning of the 19th century that there was a renewed interest in learning more about its manufacture when it was investigated by sir @entity176 in 1815 and others such as @entity178 and @entity179			0
now thanks to the discovery of its remarkable properties , @entity6 blue could be due a renaissance as part of the latest generation of high - tech nano - engineered devices			1
@entity185 , assistant professor of chemistry at @entity90 , and her colleagues detailed their findings in an article on the pigment published in the @entity191			0
they wrote : ' calcium copper silicate provides a route to a new class of nanomaterials that are particularly interesting with respect to state - of - the - art pursuits like near - @entity200 - based biomedical imaging , @entity200 light - emitting devices ( especially telecommunication platforms ) and security ink formulations			1
' in this way we can re-imagine the applications of an ancient material through modern technochemical means			0

@entity6 blue was first used 5,000 years ago in the @entity54
new research shows it could be used in state - of - the - art gadgets
it can be rolled into sheets so thin thousands would fit across a human hair
and it produces infra - red radiation like that used by tv remotes
