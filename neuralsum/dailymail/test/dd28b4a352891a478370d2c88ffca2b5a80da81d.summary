@entity0 will turn to @entity1 in a bid to save @entity4 ’s sorry season			2
the £ 6million summer signing suffered a collapsed lung in february and it was initially feared he would miss the remainder of the campaign , especially as it was the second time he had fallen victim to the problem			1
@entity11 has started just one @entity13 game since arriving from @entity14 and he was only days away from a return to action following a five - month layoff with a torn thigh muscle when he was diagnosed with the collapsed lung			1
@entity4 attacking midfielder @entity1 could return to action before the end of the current campaign @entity11 , pictured in training on april 9 with his team - mates , will feature for @entity4 's reserve side however , the 26 - year - old returned to training earlier this month and will now feature for @entity29 ’s reserves when they entertain @entity30 at @entity31 on wednesday night , as will @entity33 under 19 winger @entity32			1
sunday ’s visit of @entity35 will probably come too soon for @entity11 and hamstring absentee @entity36 – who has not played since november - but @entity0 will be desperately hoping to have them available for the final five matches of a season which is in danger of ending on a sour note			2
@entity4 have lost five on the spin and their head coach has admitted that he does not know where the next point is coming from			0
they have scored just once in eight hours and would be fighting relegation had it not been for a five - match winning run under @entity48 last autumn			0
supporters are organising a boycott ahead of the televised clash with @entity35 , where thousands are expected to stay away in protest at @entity55 ’s running of the club			0
@entity4 boss @entity0 will be hoping his side will improve following the return of @entity11			0

@entity1 has been out of action since the end of *august*
the £ 6m summer signing suffered a collapsed lung in february
