by @entity0 published : 03:29 est , 6 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:39 est , 6 december 2013 most people know the handful of rules that govern using the @entity6 – such as letting passengers off the train first and not prizing the doors open when the train is trying to set off			1
these orders are barked out by station staff through a loudspeaker system			0
@entity14 also have rules for their underground system			2
however , these have been distributed with a little more sophistication – via an online ‘ politeness ’ manual released by the @entity20 transport authority to ensure civility prevails at all times			1
rules : @entity20 has released an etiquette guide for using the @entity27 system called the ‘ @entity28 ’ – or ‘ politeness manual for the modern traveller ’ - it lists 12 ‘ commandments ’ for @entity14 to abide by and comes complete with quaint sketches to illustrate the points			1
the online guide , which was drawn up using suggestions from the public , is split into four categories – ‘ helpfulness ’ , ‘ courtesy ’ , ‘ manners ’ and ‘ politeness ’			1
the rules insist that @entity14 must offer help to tourists ‘ in @entity49 shirts with a metro map in one hand and the other hand in their hair ’ , hold the door open for passengers behind them – and greet the driver			1
take note : the guide advises travellers not to play music loudly on the @entity27 travellers should also understand , the guide states , that ‘ the huge crossed out cigarette on the platform is not a work of art but a ban on smoking ’			2
the guide is also as mischievous as it is sarcastic			0
‘ it 's worth losing two minutes of your time for a good cause if only to hear the [ foreign ] passenger struggle to pronounce [ the metro stops ] ' @entity73 ' or ' @entity74 ' , it says			0
watch out : staring at beautiful women is rude , the online @entity27 guide says the key no - nos are not playing music too loudly through headphones , resisting the temptation to stare for a long time at beautiful women and holding back from starting a fight with someone who ’s just stepped on your toes			2
loud phone conversations should also be avoided , old lady ’s bags should be carried up stairs , armpits should be covered by arms and not exposed to the carriage – and handkerchiefs not just used to wave someone off with , but to sneeze into			0
last but not least – the @entity27 is not to be mistaken for a lavatory			0
it 's the pits : arms should be kept by your side at all times on the @entity27			0

the rules were drawn up using suggestions from the @entity20 public
they have been published online by the city 's transport authority
the guide suggests greeting the driver and sneezing into handkerchiefs
