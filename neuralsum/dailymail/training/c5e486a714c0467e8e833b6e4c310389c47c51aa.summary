under construction : @entity1 is at a standstill , with republicans insisting on changes to @entity5 and @entity6 standing their ground but considering a sneaky tactic to break the logjam with no end to the government shutdown in sight , @entity6 in the @entity10 are working on a strategy that would force @entity3 ' hand and give the @entity17 administration what it wants dearly : an up - or - down vote on legislation re-opening the government with no strings attached			1
the ploy they 're exploring would mirror the unconventional – and , @entity3 have claimed , sneaky – method @entity6 used to pass the @entity5 in 2009			2
@entity6 hope their silver bullet is a so - called ' discharge petition , ' a congressional maneuver designed to break logjams when leaders of the party in power want to shelve a bill favored by a majority of legislators in the @entity10			1
the @entity38 has demanded all week that @entity3 pass a ' clean ' funding resolution , free of @entity5 - related demands			2
the @entity3 has thumbed its nose at that idea , with @entity10 speaker @entity43 relying on a modern tradition that suggests he should n't call a vote on a bill that a majority of his own caucus opposes			1
so that unadorned funding bill , unencumbered by @entity52 language , sits in limbo while @entity43 has maintained his demands for a shifting series of proposed changes to the health insurance overhaul law using the federal budget as leverage			1
he draws complaints , meanwhile , that insist – in one of the @entity6 ' online ads , at least – that he 's behaving like an obstinate crybaby			0
@entity83 rep. @entity82 ( 2nd - l ) has become a pawn of @entity6 , who will hollow out one of his bills and use it to force a vote on a funding resolution that leaves @entity5 out of the equation although all @entity6 would vote ' aye ' on a government funding bill that preserved @entity5 as - is , the 232 republicans could easily overrule them			1
the @entity38 , however , has insisted that if that funding resolution were put to a @entity10 vote , enough @entity3 would defect from their leaders ' hard line to end the budget stalemate that seized the administration 's checkbook at 12.01am on tuesday			1
satisfying certain conditions would force president @entity17 's preferred funding bill out of committee and straight to the @entity10 floor without @entity43 's approval			1
@entity10 @entity6 need to collect the signatures of 218 @entity10 members – a plain majority of the 435 seats – even though three seats are vacant			1
but the fly in the ointment is a second requirement , stating that a bill must languish in committee for at least 30 days before it can be discharged to the @entity10 floor through a petition			1
@entity6 plan to sidestep that rule with a sleight - of - hand exercise that recalls the @entity5 fight four years ago			2
instead of waiting for their ' clean ' resolution to ripen over 30 days , they have located another much older bill that has grown dusty since march			1
the @entity124 , proposed by @entity83 @entity3 rep. @entity82 , attracted only 16 co-sponsors			0
it proposed to keep government funding on autopilot if @entity129 should find itself at the end of a fiscal year without an agreement on how to move forward			2
@entity38 press secretary @entity133 ( r ) has nearly run out of new ways to say that the president wants an up - or - down vote on a ' clean ' funding resolution origination clause : @entity140 chief justice @entity139 ruled in 2012 that @entity5 was constitutional because it levied taxes , not penalties			2
but the law is still uncertain because only the @entity10 can originate a new tax -- and @entity5 had its genesis in the @entity146 , in the same kind of maneuver @entity10 @entity6 are working to end the shutdown stalemate @entity151 reps			1
@entity152 of @entity153 and @entity154 of @entity155 attached a discharge petition to that bill on friday afternoon			2
@entity154 told reporters on friday that the two plan to scoop out its innards before it reaches the @entity10 floor , and replace it with the bill they want @entity43 to put to a vote			2
' we will have a complete substitute for that language , ' said @entity154 , talking about the long - ignored @entity171 bill , ' which will be a clean continuing resolution to open up the government			0
' after the discharge petition sits in the @entity175 for 7 days , they can make a motion on the floor to present it for a vote			2
that vote could happen as soon as three days later , on oct. 14			0
should the maneuver succeed , it would end the shutdown showdown , send republicans away with their tails between their legs , and void their last , best chance to strip @entity5 of its immediacy and economic power			0
rep. @entity154 boasted at a press conference that it would n't be hard to collect 218 signatures and move the discharge petition forward			0
' we expect we can get them all in one day , ' he said			0
but finding 18 republicans who are willing to buck their leadership will be no easy task			0
publicly defying the @entity10 speaker is usually the quickest way to backbencher status , and can sometimes cost veteran legislators their committee chairmanships			0
speaker @entity43 's spokesman , @entity203 , is n't impressed with the discharge - petition idea , although it did grease the skids for the @entity209 campaign finance law in 2002 rep. @entity154 ( @entity211 ) and rep. @entity152 ( r ) , are leading a curious @entity151 charge to force @entity43 's hand and give the @entity38 the up - or - down vote it wants the @entity215 has spoken with near - unanimity in a strategy designed to take one controversial part of the shutdown after another off the table by funding them individually			1
@entity3 members cast a total of 1,588 party - line votes and just 2 ' nays ' this week in a series of measures continuing funding for veterans programs , national parks , the @entity232 , the @entity234 government , salaries for @entity236 and military reservists , nutrition programs for women and children , and military paychecks			1
senate majority leader @entity242 hollowed out a veterans tax - relief bill and dropped @entity5 inside			1
now @entity10 @entity6 aim to do the same thing in order to move a discharge petition in less than the standard 30 days the president has welcomed only the last bill , signing the military salary protection measure into law two hours before the shutdown took effect			1
he has threatened vetos of all the others			0
if , somehow , @entity152 and @entity154 were able to find 18 republicans willing to rock the boat , it would mark the second time @entity17 's health insurance overhaul was advanced by hiding one bill inside the shell of another			2
the @entity5 itself was passed by shoehorning language into a hollowed - out bill			2
it originated as a @entity10 measure called the @entity5 , a proposal from @entity270 @entity151 rep. @entity269 to give tax credits to soldiers , sailors and @entity274 who wanted to buy homes			0
the @entity10 passed it unanimously in october 2009			0
by the following month , however , @entity151 senate majority leader @entity242 had renamed the bill the @entity5 , gutted it completely , and amended it by filling the empty space with @entity5 's legislative language			1
conservatives have held out hope that @entity242 's maneuver will ultimately prove to be @entity5 's downfall			0
a lawsuit from the @entity285 , currently pending in a federal appeals court , contends that by leaving the bill 's number as the only portion of the @entity5 that originated in the @entity10 , @entity242 violated the @entity291 @entity290			1
the @entity290 's ' @entity292 ' states only the @entity10 can originate bills that levy taxes on the @entity291 people			0
the tax issue only entered the controversy in 2012 when @entity140 chief justice @entity139 wrote that penalties associated with @entity5 's individual health insurance mandate were actually justifiable taxes			2
it was this feature , @entity139 ruled , that made the law permissible in the first place			0
some @entity6 , including @entity38 press secretary @entity133 , do n't care how @entity43 caves , as long as he does			0
@entity10 @entity6 including @entity270 rep. @entity306 ( @entity211 ) have screamed at the @entity3 majority that they want a vote on reopening the government without clamping any restrictions on the @entity5 law			1
the @entity3 wants a delay in implementing the most crucial part of the health insurance overhaul ' what i can tell you is they ought to just act and let the majority speak and let the bill pass , ' @entity133 said friday , ' and the president will sign it			0
however that comes about is fine with us			0
' but he is certain that if the president 's long - awaited ' clean ' funding bill comes to the @entity10 floor , it would pass despite influences from the tea - party - influenced right wing of the @entity3			1
' we 're confident , and i think @entity3 across @entity234 are confident , that if the speaker put that bill on the floor , it would pass with @entity151 and @entity3 votes , ' @entity133 predicted			0
. ' and by some @entity3 estimates , many @entity3 votes			0
' approximately 20 @entity3 @entity10 members have said publicly that they would vote to re-open the government if they had the chance , with or without changes to @entity5			1
@entity6 are about to learn if they are willing to put their status in the @entity3 leadership 's pecking order where their mouths are .			0

@entity10 @entity3 want changes to the @entity5 law as a condition of funding the federal government in the new fiscal year
@entity10 @entity6 will try to invoke a ' discharge petition ' to force speaker @entity43 to call a budget vote without putting @entity5 at risk
the idea requires collecting signatures from a majority of @entity10 members , a number that can only be reached with the help of at least 18 republicans
instead of waiting the required 30 days to file their petition , @entity6 will side - stepping the rules by hollowing out an older bill and dropping their funding language inside
this trick was how @entity6 passed @entity5 in the first place , scooping out a @entity10 tax - relief bill for veterans and replacing its text in the @entity146 with @entity5 's language
@entity6 boast they can pull off the stunt and *persuade* at least 18 republicans to defect ' all in one day '
