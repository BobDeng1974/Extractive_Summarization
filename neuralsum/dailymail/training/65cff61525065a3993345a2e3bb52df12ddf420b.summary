@entity9 has pledged £ 50million in public money to mark the event , with school trips to battlefields and ceremonies planned over four years			1
but visits by officials to @entity3 to discuss the centenary have provoked little interest , with academics accusing their leaders of adopting a ‘ stupid ’ and ‘ inappropriate ’ reluctance to participate , according to reports			1
reluctance : @entity3 is showing ' disinterest ' in commemorating the centenary of the start of the @entity6 , despite meetings with the @entity9 government to try to coordinate the ceremonies ( file picture ) the @entity29 government has also embraced the centenary , planning 1,500 events across the country			1
it has invited warring parties for a ‘ peace demonstration ’ on @entity36 , july 14			0
a @entity3 - @entity9 ceremony is planned the next day in @entity38 , which was invaded by @entity3 troops on the first day of the war , august 3 , 1914			1
but there are few plans for events in @entity3 itself			2
vow : @entity9 has pledged £ 50million in public money to mark the event			1
above , prime minister @entity47 visits the grave of a soldier who died in the @entity6 in @entity50 , @entity38 according to @entity3 reports , the senior diplomat in charge of the events , @entity51 , has done little except meet experts to discuss the ww1 plans			1
however , one project he has been closely involved with is the plan to build a @entity29 - @entity3 museum at the site of the @entity63 battlefield in @entity64 where up to 30,000 @entity3 and @entity29 died on what the troops called the ‘ @entity67			2
’ @entity29 president @entity69 and the @entity3 federal president , @entity68 will lay a foundation stone for a new museum chronicling the fighting there at the start of august next year			1
there are also exhibitions planned at the @entity77 in @entity78 and the @entity79 in @entity80			0
memorial : a @entity29 - @entity3 museum is expected to be built at the site of the @entity63 battlefield ( pictured ) in @entity83 , where up to 30,000 @entity3 and @entity29 died during the war ‘ our look is at reconciliation , to have as many former enemies together as possible and to show that we have learned from our mistakes , ’ said @entity85 , a spokesman for the @entity86 in @entity87			2
but @entity93 , a @entity3 who is professor of central @entity96 history at @entity97 , said : ‘ both the @entity9 and @entity29 have set aside vast funds for the commemoration and in good time , while @entity3 decided that their efforts would be reactive - so no wonder many feel that attitude is a bit stupid			1
‘ it is now clear that there will be a last minute arrangement which seems a bit inappropriate			0
’ tribute : @entity29 president @entity69 will lay a foundation stone at the site of the battlefield in august next year @entity3 historian @entity114 , who is advising the @entity29 government on the centenary , said the @entity3 government was ‘ fundamentally uninterested ’			2
the @entity29 were irritated with the ‘ we want nothing to do with it ’ attitude of the @entity3 , he said			2
he added : ‘ it is a different experience for each country			0
there is no such thing as a common @entity96 mindset or sensitivity , @entity96 very much remains a rational idea			0
’ over the course of 52 months , the war left 10 million dead and 20 million injured on battlefields from the @entity133 coast to the deserts of the @entity135			0
some six million @entity9 served in the @entity136 during the war , and 800,000 of them never came home			2
that is more than twice the number of troops as perished in @entity142 historian @entity143 has called for the @entity9 government not to bury @entity9 ’s role in the war or to shy away from attributing blame to the @entity3			1
‘ we are witnessing a depressingly familiar spectacle			0
political correctness has taken hold			0
those planning the commemoration feel almost embarrassed that we won the war , and are determined to say and do nothing that might upset @entity3 , our modern @entity157 partner , ’ he wrote in the @entity148			0
‘ i can think of no greater betrayal than for the @entity159 next year to pretend that they perished for nothing , because ignorant or frightened ministers flinch from upsetting today ’s @entity3 , who have readily understandable reasons for wishing to ignore yet another of their nation ’s least fortunate anniversaries			0
’ @entity85 , press attaché at the @entity3 embassy in @entity87 , said in august ‘ it would be easier ’ for @entity9 to adopt a ‘ less declamatory tone ’ if it wants @entity3 to take part			1
‘ our feeling is that issues about who was guilty and all that should be left more or less to historians and should n’t feature dominantly in politicians ’ speeches			0
‘ the biggest single contribution to the start of the @entity6 was @entity3 , but others played a part			1
whether it was a win or not , it was n’t worth it			0
’ @entity3 would prefer the commemorations to focus on the dead , rather than the battles			0
mr @entity85 also said the focus should be on the unity brought to the continent by the creation of the @entity157			0
but he has denied that there is friction with @entity9 over the event planning .			1
