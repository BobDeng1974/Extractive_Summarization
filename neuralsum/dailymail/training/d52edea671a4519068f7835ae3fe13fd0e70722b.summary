@entity0 says @entity2 teams have struggled to deal with @entity4 ’s quick wing - play and he has a point			1
since the start of last season they have beaten @entity9 and @entity10 in the @entity11 and @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 in the @entity15			0
@entity16 certainly need to be careful in wednesday night ’s @entity11 semi-final first leg at @entity18			1
@entity0 , manager of @entity4 , has already beaten @entity2 outfit twice in the competition @entity21 celebrates scoring for @entity4 in last year 's @entity15 semi-final against @entity23 @entity4 players celebrate dumping @entity2 high - flyers @entity10 out of the @entity11 @entity26 ( right ) , @entity0 's father , used to set up his @entity28 sides in a similar way forest players , including @entity0 's son @entity0 ( centre ) celebrate scoring a @entity18 in 1992 @entity10 players look distraught after conceding against @entity4 in the quarter - final there is no doubt young @entity0 will have grown up watching the great sides assembled by his father - with the likes of @entity41 bombing forward for @entity28			1
the wingers for @entity26 ’s sides were always the catalyst for success and it looks like @entity0 is using a similar template			1
@entity4 have a variety of players capable of playing on the wing , but they all have one thing in common - they are happy to sling in crosses from every angle			2
@entity54 likes to push upfield and cut inside to cross with his right foot and @entity56 , who has played on the wing and at full back this season , is a bag of tricks down the right			0
@entity63 became the youngest player to play for @entity4 in the league last year and , at 17 , is a talented youngster , while @entity67 is another rapid wide man			2
@entity0 says top - flight teams struggle with @entity4 ’s crosses but it ’s more to do with the number of men who are prepared to fly forward and get on the end of them			1
in the @entity2 , defenders are used to playing against lone strikers with maybe another runner off the front into the area			0
the reason the likes of @entity10 and @entity14 have found it tough against @entity4 is because they pile people forward			2
against @entity10 there were times when the score was 0 - 0 but they still had five men in the box to aim for			0
they know they have midfielders who can play and @entity21 and @entity93 in particular are excellent at joining the attack			0
@entity16 boss @entity95 knows his side must be wary of @entity4 players celebrate after @entity98 scores the winning penalty in a shoot - out against @entity9 @entity9 players looked dejected after they conceded against @entity4 in the @entity11 for @entity16 , the best way to combat this is to cut out the crosses at the source			1
it will be up to @entity107 and @entity108 to deal with the threat of these deliveries , but if @entity4 do get past the full backs @entity16 have to be very well organised in the middle			2
it ’s just as important for midfielders to tuck back in and help as it is for the centre halves to defend well			0
@entity117 of @entity4 celebrates with his team - mate after scoring against @entity119 @entity0 has his side utilising quick wingers and allows his players to flood forward in attack striker @entity124 returned to the @entity16 first - team against @entity126 on saturday @entity10 are a well - drilled side but even they could n’t cope with @entity4 ’s numbers in the area			1
@entity16 will want the tie done and dusted			0
if @entity4 get them back to @entity132 , it could get tasty			0
it is a fantastic old ground and if there is still a chance of a @entity138 final the atmosphere will be absolutely red hot			0
@entity56 ( right ) is a doubt for the game having missed saturday 's defeat at @entity119 @entity67 ( centre ) celebrates scoring against @entity14 in the @entity15 this month @entity143 ( right ) scores @entity4 's winning goal against @entity10 in the quarter - finals			1
