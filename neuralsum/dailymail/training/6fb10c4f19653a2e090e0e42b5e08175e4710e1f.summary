by @entity0 published : 10:24 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 11:44 est , 26 june 2013 a group of 20 tourists were rescued from the @entity4 @entity3 today following a miraculous stroke of luck			1
the group had been trapped at sea on a 30 mile long ice sheet after it broke away from @entity10 sometime between monday night and early tuesday and floated out to sea			1
but the ice sheet on which they had found themselves trapped bumped into another ice sheet which was touching land earlier today , the @entity4 coast guard said			1
adrift : a group of 20 @entity4 tourists was left stranded 2 miles from land when a 30 - nmile long ice sheet they were camped on broke free from @entity10 the group managed to walk from one ice sheet to the other before reaching dry land , the coastguard confirmed this afternoon			1
‘ everyone is safe and sound , ’ marine coordinator @entity27 told @entity28			0
a rescue plane had managed to drop survival kits onto the three and half square - mile frozen sheet on tuesday , after the group alerted authorities to their plight			1
the kits included satellite phones , inflatable rafts and food rations			0
the plane kept a watch on the group while they waited for helicopters to arrive			2
but when the helicopters did arrived early on wednesday , bad weather prevented rescuers from hoisting the group on board			1
they have been standing by to airlift them to an @entity3 station ever since			0
sub-zero : the group were rather lucky as the weather at this time of year rarely falls below zero ( file photo ) ‘ we are having regular conversations with them through satellite phone , ’ mr @entity27 said			1
the tourists do not appear to be in danger of exposure			0
they are dressed warmly and have been able to remain dry , he added			0
@entity28 reported @entity4 air force spokesman @entity64 as saying : ‘ ice breaking off is a very common thing at this time of year			2
' the floe drifted two miles away from land and started to break up mr @entity64 said			1
had it fallen apart , the three rubber rafts were more than large enough to hold the whole group , he added			2
@entity10 is in the @entity4 territory of @entity73 and is the largest island in @entity4 and the fifth largest island in the world			1
it is 195,928 square miles in size and its population was estimated at 11,000 in 2007			2
@entity10 lies in the path of a generally northerly airflow all year round			1
winters tend to be very long and foggy while @entity85 thaw arrives later than normal given its position in the @entity87 usually not occurring until early june in the south or even as late as early to mid-july on the northern coast where glaciers run right down to sea level @entity93 , even heavy snow , occurs at any time of the year , although is least likely in july and early august			0
temperatures in @entity73 ’s capital @entity97 can hit a high of 9 degrees @entity99 in july while the coldest month is february when temperatures can fall as low as -33 degrees @entity99			0
sea ice surrounds the island for most of the year and only disappears completely from the north coast for short unpredictable periods from mid to late june until the end of september			2
most of @entity10 lies above the @entity87 and most of the communities that live on the island have polar night in winter and the midnight sun in summer			1
the north eastern community of @entity113 has twilight instead of night from april 26 until may 13 , continuous sunlight for two and half months from may 14 to july 28 , then twilight instead of night from july 29 until august 16			0
this gives the community just over three and a half months without true night			0
in the winter the sun sets on november 22 and does not rise again until january 19 of the next year			0
however , there is twilight for at least 4 hours a day			0
the island is named after @entity124 explorer @entity122 , although it is likely that the island was known to @entity128 explorers from @entity129 and @entity130 .			0
