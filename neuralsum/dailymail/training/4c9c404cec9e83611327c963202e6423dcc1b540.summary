by @entity0 published : 09:34 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 10:31 est , 15 november 2013 with @entity2 just around the corner , time is fast approaching for @entity4 countrywide to show their gratitude for the food on their plates			0
but then again there may be one or two who 'll be more grateful going hungry on november 28th than tuck into any of these home - cooked horrors			0
the profoundly unappetizing selection of images have been compiled on an @entity16 account called cookingforbae , in a bid to chronicle quite how bad bad cooking can be			1
they range from sausage and mush to pancakes that look like pork chops and cheese that could be insulator foam to shiny shepherd 's pie			1
but the majority of dishes are downright indistinguishable and do n't even have an explanation on the @entity16 account , suggesting the cooks themselves were n't entirely sure what they 'd made			1
bangers and mush : it 's hard to know what many of the items of food are to die from : this is a broccoli cheese casserole , according to the cook who conceived it @entity45 : @entity46 says this monstrosity is a shepherd 's pie but it 's hard to tell pork or pancake ? according to the post on cookingforbae , these are actually pancakes doused in syrup			2
although many of @entity55 's followers mistook them for pork chops rather eat your heart out ? it is unclear exactly what is on this plate			2
apart from what looks suspiciously like an omelet , the rest is indistinguishable not on your sausage : here are just two of the many ways you can cook frankfurter sausages sludge : the majority of dishes do n't even have an explanation on the @entity16 account , suggesting the cooks themselves were n't entirely sure what they 'd made questionable : the pictures are enough to make even the most strong - stomached eater reach for the sick bag the romance killer : the poster of this picture was cooking for her boyfriend			1
but this dish is sure to kill any romance goo do you think you 're kidding ? apparently this is oatmeal porridge and bake but it could be any number of things ribs of squid ? there is no explanation , or excuse , for this kind of cooking what the shell is that ? this elegantly presented lobster platter may not look tasty but that has n't stopped the person holding the plate from piling it on a bit of a pickle : the only distinguishable food stuff in this dinner is the pickle garnish and the pasta			0
the rest is anybody 's guess who knows ? the poster of this picture said he 'd rather eat the blue plate than taste what 's on it @entity127 surprise : this is apparently leftovers of a sunday roast			0
it is unclear what the pink and purple side order is , though eye - watering : some of the chefs are so accomplished at cooking badly that they compiled montages of their concoctions no idea : the sight alone of some of these dishes is enough to make your eyes water			0

the *unsightly* images were compiled on @entity16 account cookingforbae
they range from pies and casseroles to pancakes that look like pork chops
but the vast majority of dishes are utterly *unidentifiable*
