a father was disgusted after his severely disabled son might have to prove he could n't work in order to receive benefits			2
@entity4 , 18 , was not expected to live beyond three months old after he was born paralysed and has remained on life support since birth			1
but @entity4 defied his prognosis and celebrated his milestone birthday in december last year despite being born with an incredibly rare condition , called myotubular myopathy , a terminal muscle wasting disease			1
a letter was sent to @entity4 's home saying he might be required to attend a ' @entity15 ' in order to continue to receive @entity17 he requires a ventilator to breathe and needs constant care from his parents @entity20 , 52 , and @entity22 , 44 , at their home in @entity24 , @entity25			1
the family were awaiting news on which benefits their son would be entitled to but were shocked when they received a letter which informed them @entity4 would be entitled to employment and support allowance but that he may need to attend a ' @entity37 interview ' in order to receive them			1
two weeks ago , mrs @entity40 , who also has a 12 - year - old daughter , discovered that @entity4 's child benefit payments had been stopped			1
mr @entity4 said : ' i discovered the letter last week			1
we 'd been on a week 's respite and it was there when we got back			0
' i rang @entity48 and a woman on the phone asked me : " can he work ? " ' i tried to explain his medical condition and she just said : " it 's a yes or no answer , it 's a standard issue form			0
" mr @entity4 explained that his son could n't work but the lady on the phone said he may have to be interviewed and receive a medical assessment			1
the letter insulted the family who claimed the @entity62 should have looked at @entity64 records beforehand the father explained there was no way his son could attend an interview as the only place he visits is the hospital			1
the family are still waiting to be instructed on what they are supposed to do now			0
the father believes that @entity62 should know @entity4 's situation as they have his national insurance number , which can be used to reveal he claims disability benefits			1
' i was quite annoyed really at that , ' he said			0
' after 18 - years surely they must know now			2
' how is he going to go to a back to work interview ? he can not answer them			2
he can only communicate with a blink so i do not know what they are going to expect him to do			2
' if another disabled person had these issues and did n't have a full time carer , they might lose their benefits or not know what to do			2
it 's caused a lot of upset			0
' i do n't think they really understand the situation and if they 'd just looked into his national insurance number or looked into his records properly they would realise he ca n't work			0
' the @entity103 says candidates found to be incapable of work , receive long term support			0
a spokesperson for the @entity103 said : ' often as a child gets older their needs change over time			0
' @entity111 looks at what a person can do , not only on what they can not			0
' if someone is not capable of any work , then they will of course get long term incapacity support through the benefits system			0

@entity4 , 18 , can only communicate by blinking
a letter @entity62 said he might have to attend an interview to carry on getting benefits
