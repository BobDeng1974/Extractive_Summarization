scientists have discovered an @entity2 ’ heel of prostate cancer that could lead to better treatment for many men diagnosed with the disease @entity9 scientists have discovered an ‘ achilles ’ heel ’ in prostate cancer which could lead to better treatments			1
the disease claims almost 11,000 lives a year in the @entity9 , with most deaths occurring after it spreads around the body			1
the latest study gets to the root of this spread , and could mean better outcomes for the 42,000 men a year diagnosed with the illness			1
scientists funded by @entity25 studied samples taken from tumours in the prostate and around the body in ten affected men			1
reading the dna revealed details of how the cancer metastasises , or spreads , allowing them to build a ‘ family tree ’ of how the disease changes over time			2
it seems that most of the cells in a tumour stay where they are			0
however , a small number have the ability to travel through the body , creating new tumours as they go			0
these cells are the ‘ root ’ of the cancer and for a treatment to work , they should be destroyed			1
in future , doctors may be able to find these key cells in individual patients			0
they could then be given drugs to wipe them out , with each patient ’s treatment tailored to the genetic flaw at the root of their cancer			1
this should kill the new tumours and prevent more from forming , greatly improving odds of survival			2
@entity66 researcher professor @entity65 said some suitable drugs already exist , and that new ones are being developed all the time			0
however , he cautioned that it will be three to five years before the latest knowledge can be routinely put to use in the @entity71			2
lead study author professor @entity72 , from the @entity73 in @entity74 , said : ‘ we gained a much broader view of prostate cancer by studying both the original cancer and the cells that had spread to other parts of the body			1
‘ we found that all of the cells that had broken free shared a common ancestor cell in the prostate			0
‘ the common faults we found in each man could potentially offer new targets for treatment			0
’ co-author dr @entity89 , from the @entity90 in @entity91 , described the finding as a ‘ potential achilles ’ heel ’			0
professor @entity94 , chief clinician at @entity25 , said : ‘ this research lets us look right into the molecular core of cancer			0
’ samples were taken from tumours in the prostate and around the body in ten men with the disease ( pictured )			1
reading the dna revealed details of how the cancer metastasises - or spreads - allowing scientists to understand how the disease changes over time			2

@entity9 scientists say they have got to the ' root ' of prostate cancer
have exposed an @entity116 that could lead to better survival chances
could mean that men get individualised treatments within a few years
