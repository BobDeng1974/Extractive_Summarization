' once the kids got older - they are now 15 and 12 - they wanted to join in too			0
' the owners and their dogs get into shape for the competition with bootcamps at the beginning of the season and mr @entity62 said it 's important you do n't pile on too many pounds over summer , as it will only slow the dogs down			2
a girl 's best friend : a @entity44 breed dog gives one young girl a wet kiss on the cheek after the race there are usually three heats but the saturday night heat this year was cancelled because it was too hot for the dogs to race ' we ca n't run over 15 degrees - the welfare of the dogs is paramount ... and they can overheat if we run over 15			1
