by @entity1 reporter published : 02:59 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 04:33 est , 3 october 2013 two teenage @entity3 pupils have been put into ' isolation ' and banned from lessons after refusing to shave off their beards for religious reasons			1
@entity8 , in @entity9 , @entity10 , has said the two 14 - year - olds are in breach of the dress code , which bans beards as well as false nails , fake tan , make - up , dyed hair and inappropriate jewellery			1
but the boys ' families have said they are suffering discrimination because beards are a symbol of faith and their religion forbids them to shave			1
two @entity3 students have been banned from lessons at @entity8 , in @entity10 , for breaching the dress code by refusing to shave off their beards the school has said after conducting its own research it has concluded they are not required by the @entity33 to wear beards , and are making a choice to do so			1
the school remains adamant they will not be allowed to go back until the matter is resolved			1
around a third of the 750 pupils at @entity40 are from ethnic minorities , mostly @entity42 , according to the 2012 @entity44 report			2
@entity45 , head teacher at the school , said governors had decided no exceptions could be made to the uniform policy			2
but a relative of one of the boys said : ' because these boys can not shave their beards for religious reasons , they are being put in isolation for six - and - a - half hours every day			1
' they are not being allowed to mix with anybody or speak to friends			0
' they chose that school because it is within their area and has good results			2
the school has to have an open policy and they have to take in people from all religions			2
' she said the youngsters were put in a room on their own and made to study without the rest of their classmates			0
she also said their parents sent the school a letter of complaint explaining they could not shave as their beards were symbols of their faith			1
the school has said the pupils are breaching the dress code , which bans beards as well as false nails , fake tan , make - up , dyed hair and inappropriate jewellery ( file picture ) the letter has since been retracted to allow for talks between the families , teachers and the @entity95 , due to take place today , the relative said			1
mr @entity45 said the rule had been in place for a while , but had been strictly enforced from the beginning of the new term , after letters explaining there would be no exceptions were sent out			0
he said : ' the rule in school is that all boys have to be clean shaven			1
' having said that , there were two year 11 boys last year who had grown a beard and because it was months or weeks before their gcse exams , i spoke to the two boys , who explained that on religious grounds , they wanted to keep their beards			1
' because these boys can not shave their beards for religious reasons , they are being put in isolation for six - and - a - half hours every day			1
they are not being allowed to mix with anybody or speak to friends			0
it is pure discrimination ' - a relative of one of the boys ' i felt it was an unfair pressure to bear on them and i agreed to an exception			1
' on the back of that , i made arrangements to speak to a number of other @entity138 boys who were also sporting beards to make them aware there would not be any further exceptions and , when they came back after the summer , they were expected to be clean - shaven			1
' children who turn up to school with red hair , inappropriate jewellery , false tan or make - up are isolated in a room until the matter is addressed and then they return to their normal day			2
' these boys were given the option to do that and chose not to			2
' the issue of whether beards are compulsory for devout @entity3 is open to interpretation , according to professor @entity159 , of the @entity160 at the @entity161			2
he said the @entity162 was believed to have had a beard and that men insisting on doing the same claimed they were emulating his actions			0
mr @entity45 said the issue was not one of religion , but of upholding school rules			1
he said : ' we have not taken this decision lightly			0
i have spent quite a lot of time researching the issue and speaking to @entity3 elders			0
' there is nothing specifically written in the @entity33 about wearing a beard			0
it is a choice those boys are making			0
however inclusive we are , we have standards to maintain			0
' chairman of governors @entity182 said : ' the decision to uphold the rule was made by governors and it is a rule for everybody			0
' @entity188 , chairman of the @entity95 , said : ' the headteacher is co-operating and the school wants to learn about the issue and address them appropriately			0
' different people have different variations of understanding			0
' some are newly interacting with the @entity3 community and it is our duty not to put people in awkward positions			0
' last week the prime minister indicated he would support guidelines to judges , teachers and immigration officers telling them when @entity3 women can be asked to remove their veils .			0
