@entity0 has given himself the chance to claim his first trophy at @entity3 just three weeks into the job			1
and to add to the intrigue , it will be @entity3 ’s most - detested rivals @entity7 trying to stand in his way			0
winning the @entity10 , a glorified pre-season tournament in @entity12 , may not be the main reason @entity3 turned to @entity14 after 12 months of @entity15 , but it ’ll still be a nice start to the @entity18 ’s time at @entity19 if his side win the final in @entity22 on monday			1
@entity3 qualified for the showpiece game by defeating @entity24 in front of a record crowd in @entity27 on saturday night and will now face their north - west neighbours who topped the other group in the eight - team competition			1
goals : @entity33 20 , 37 , @entity70 80			2
@entity24 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity72 6 ; @entity73 6 ( @entity49 73mins 6 ) , @entity74 6 , @entity75 6.5 , @entity76 7 ; @entity77 7 ( @entity78 55mins 7.5 ) ; @entity79 6.5 , @entity80 6 , @entity81 6 , @entity82 7 ; @entity83 6			1
goals : @entity82 ( pen ) 27			0
booked : @entity73 , @entity83			0
man of the match : @entity63			0
@entity33 was @entity3 's unlikely hero with two goals against @entity24 where the other main source of interest was the size of the attendance inside the @entity96 ’s american football stadium , 109,318			1
it was the biggest crowd ever seen for a “ soccer ” game in @entity12 and represented the largest attendance for any @entity3 match since 1957 when they travelled to @entity24 ’s @entity24 ’s @entity103 in the fledgling @entity104			1
on this occasion , @entity24 were without their talisman @entity49 until the closing stages and looked a pale shadow of the side that lifted the @entity104 in may			1
@entity82 was clearly their best player , winning and scoring a penalty to briefly make the game 1 - 1			1
but their manager @entity111 never got to grips with the 3 - 4 - 3 formation @entity14 is using to try and get the best out of his array of attacking players			0
breaking the deadlock : @entity33 opened the scoring for @entity3 with a crisp finish past @entity72 celebrate : @entity33 's team - mates rush over to congratulate him after he put @entity3 ahead in the first half burst of pace : @entity82 draws a foul from @entity124 inside the penalty area cool customer : the former @entity128 man made no mistake with his penalty that brought @entity24 level calm reaction : the @entity133 celebrates after firing his penalty past @entity134 the setting was worthy of arguably the two most glamorous teams in world football , and star names like @entity82 and @entity69			1
the giant cavernous arena , an hour outside @entity44 , is known locally with good reason as @entity39 and @entity3 ’s skipper @entity63 admitted before kick - off : ‘ you think you ’ve done it all with @entity3 and all over the world , but this is going to be a unique occasion			2
’ there was some disappointment that @entity49 was n’t fit enough to start because of his knee injury picked up at the @entity150			0
capacity crowd : two former @entity153 players jostle for the ball as @entity64 shields it from @entity82 dictating play : @entity69 put in a good performance for @entity14 's side as they upset @entity24 in @entity44 friendly : @entity67 and @entity74 challenge for a cross as @entity3 have the best of the early exchanges acrobatic attempt : @entity82 forced @entity134 into action with an ambitious overhead kick nice turn : @entity67 spins away from @entity73 for @entity3 during the first half in @entity44 @entity171 armada : @entity65 , left , and @entity77 , right , watch the run of the ball during the match in flight : @entity79 heads the ball to a team - mate after wanting it more than his opponent young but it did n’t stop thousands of fans drinking beer and enjoying barbecues around the stadium in the hours leading up to kick - off			1
despite the numbers attending , what followed still felt like a pre-season friendly , but @entity3 would have been heartened to see red shirts greatly outnumber white on all four sides			0
@entity3 had already beaten @entity190 and @entity191 in the competition and knew a draw would be good enough to see them through to @entity195			0
the goal that gave them the lead after 21 minutes was good enough to grace any competition , a superb team effort involving six different players			0
@entity56 and @entity202 began the move inside their own half and @entity63 then carried the ball towards the danger - zone , playing a one - two with @entity69 and advancing to the edge of the @entity24 penalty area via a clever back - heel from the @entity212 man			2
@entity63 thought momentarily about a shot but instead slid a pass across to @entity67			0
it proved the right call , @entity67 played in @entity33 on the overlap and while his low finish was n’t particularly well - placed , it was struck firmly enough to beat @entity72			1
despairing dive : @entity72 did not expect @entity33 's cross to bounce past @entity69 when @entity3 went 2 - 1 up back in front : @entity69 points to @entity33 after his cross evaded @entity72 and bounced in at the back post bright start : @entity69 congratulates @entity33 after his cross inadvertently put @entity3 back in front against @entity24 without @entity49 watching from the sidelines , it was up to @entity82 to provide the spur			1
and he did just that after 27 minutes			0
the super-charged @entity133 , the world ’s most expensive player at £ 86million was far too quick for @entity124 , not for the first or last time			0
and as the @entity3 defender put out his arm to try and hold @entity82 back , the @entity229 did n’t need much encouragement to hit the floor			1
after a couple of moments of deliberation , referee @entity87 pointed to the spot			0
@entity82 trotted up as if he was in the local park rather than in front of a six - figure audience , and calmly sent @entity134 the wrong way from the spot			2
suddenly the game was easing through the gears , and @entity3 restored their lead after 37 minutes			2
cometh the hour : @entity49 made a surprise appearance against his old employers but had little impact @entity249 turn : the @entity252 captain did not push himself too hard as he continues his preparations for the season still a threat : @entity64 and @entity58 keep a close eye on @entity49 as he dribbles with the ball for @entity24 @entity33 , one of those deemed under threat in the new @entity14 regime , scored again			1
@entity69 tried to head his left - wing centre and even though he did n’t make contact , the striker did enough to distract @entity72 and allow the cross to trickle inside the far post			2
@entity69 held up his hand in celebration , confusing the stadium announcer who thought he might have scored , but the player indicated to @entity33 it was the winger ’s goal			2
as often happens on these occasions , the second half was affected by a mass of substitutions			0
@entity14 took off his two most potent forwards @entity33 and @entity69 , and @entity24 fought hard to level			1
@entity82 set up @entity83 with a scorching run but the @entity279 could n’t convert			0
@entity82 was then denied by a fine save			0
the crowd came to life when @entity49 , who had n’t played since the @entity150 because of a knee injury , came on for the last 16 minutes , looking every inch the @entity286 star			2
heading home : @entity70 beats @entity72 to the ball to make it 3 - 1 to @entity3 at the @entity39 praise the provider : @entity70 points to @entity66 after heading home the @entity294 international 's cross all smiles : @entity66 hugs @entity70 after he scored @entity3 's third and final goal with his head respect : @entity49 and @entity75 congratulate @entity70 after his goal in the closing stages for @entity3 but he did n’t have much of an impact			1
instead , his former @entity3 team - mates scored a third goal after 80 minutes when @entity66 floated in a delightful cross which @entity70 bravely headed in from close range			1
eyebrows were raised when @entity3 appointed @entity15 because he had never won a trophy			0
for @entity14 to start work on july 23 and pick up silverware on august 4 would be impressive , even if @entity7 will have something to say about that			0
celebratory tweet : @entity3 's sponsor @entity313 posted a message of support with a picture of the players full : the @entity39 was jam - packed for @entity3 's exciting win against the @entity35 champions			2

@entity33 opened the scoring for @entity0 's side with an impressive finish
@entity24 were level shortly after when @entity82 won and scored a penalty
but @entity33 put @entity14 's side back in front with a cross from deep that bounced past @entity72
@entity49 was introduced in the 74th minute against his old side
before the game he said he would never rule out a return to @entity3
@entity70 added a third for the @entity338 in the 80th minute
the match was played in front of 109,318 people at the @entity39
