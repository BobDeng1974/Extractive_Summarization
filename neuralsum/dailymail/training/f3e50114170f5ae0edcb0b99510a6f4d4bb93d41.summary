that @entity0 raced clear as the first man through to the quarter - finals on monday represents something of an irony			1

soon after he turned to compatriot @entity54 and employed him as his coach			1

‘ the main part that is coming from @entity54 to me and what i feel in this relationship is big confidence , ’ said @entity0 , understandably given @entity54 ’s indomitable character			1
‘ having him over here beside me is definitely another big plus			0
he ’s been in the second week of @entity65 many times , so of course i ’m leaving up to him all the small details to give me some advice			1
opponent : @entity0 must now try and defeat the no 1 seed @entity25 on wednesday ‘ @entity54 is different when he plays and when he ’s off the court			1
when he ’s coaching he ’s very calm character and very positive			0
