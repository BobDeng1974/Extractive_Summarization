by @entity0 published : 07:56 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 10:48 est , 21 november 2013 horrific : @entity1 was trampled by cows as she was walking in a field with her dog in @entity5 , @entity6 a 59 - year - old nurse has been left in intensive care after being trampled by a herd of cows - while taking part in a treasure hunt			1
@entity1 was walking in a field with her dog in @entity5 , @entity6 , when the group of animals charged , leaving her with life - threatening injuries			1
she suffered two broken arms , a broken collarbone , a broken jaw and several broken ribs in the terrifying stampede on saturday afternoon			1
incredibly , @entity1 bravely managed to dial 999 herself but it took paramedics 30 minutes to find her as she did not know where she was			1
she was taken to @entity25 where she remains in a stable condition after several operations to save her life			2
yesterday her worried brother @entity29 , 62 , said : ' she is now very slowly on the mend			2
' @entity1 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , had been ' geocaching ' - an internet - based high - tech treasure hunt which uses gps			1
a @entity38 spokesman said : ' we received a call from a woman saying she had been injured and was lying in a field			1
' she said she had been hurt when cows stampeded and knocked her over			2
' although she did n’t know exactly where she was , within half - an - hour her car was located at @entity5 cemetery			2
' and she was found in the field off @entity48 in the village soon after			1
' the woman was in quite a bad way , with severe injuries including a broken jaw and other fractures			1
' @entity48 in @entity5 , @entity6			1
@entity1 suffered her horrific injuries in a nearby field @entity1 ’s pet @entity58 was uninjured after she ran off when around a dozen cows charged at them at around 3.25pm			1
@entity62 @entity61 and brother @entity29 found the petrified dog cowering in a bush the following day			2
the police spokesman added : ' @entity67 was just coming off duty when the incident happened on saturday			2
most members of the public are wary of bulls , but few realise that cows , particularly those protecting newly - born calves , can also be dangerous			2
if you find yourself in a field of suddenly wary cattle , move away as carefully and quietly as possible , and if you feel threatened by cattle then let go of your dog ’s lead and let it run free rather than try to protect it and endanger yourself			1
the dog will outrun the cows and it will outrun you			2
those without canine companions should follow similar advice : move away calmly , do not panic and make no sudden noises			2
chances are the cows will leave you alone once they establish that you pose no threat			0
if you walk through a field of cows and there happen to be calves , think twice ; if you can , go another way and avoid crossing fields			1
source : @entity100 ' and , when she came back on sunday , she went out with the lady ’s brother and - after a search - found her dog , which had run off			0
' it is not clear whether @entity1 was on private land at the time or whether she had permission to be in the field as part of the hunt			1
@entity113 councillor @entity112 , added : ' you ’d have thought permission would be required from the landowner to bury something on farmland			0
' the @entity119 of @entity121 ’s code of conduct simply states : ' respect property rights and seek permission where appropriate			0
' its chairman @entity125 said : ' news of @entity1 ’s accident at the weekend did reach us and we have passed on our best wishes for a speedy recovery			1
' the @entity132 are n’t able to discuss the accident as we do n’t know the circumstances or details of her injuries			1
' however , i have sent a message to one of her geocaching friends who is in contact with her family			0
' @entity143 posted miss @entity1 ’s plight on the @entity145			1
he said : ' take care out there folks			0
unfortunately , i have some upsetting news			0
' @entity1 was caching on saturday and she was stampeded by a herd of cows			1
unfortunately this left her seriously injured and she is now in intensive care in hospital			0
' she has a number of fractures , is stable and is sedated for pain control			0
' injuries : the cows left the 59 - year - old with two broken arms , a broken collarbone , a broken jaw and several broken ribs			1
file picture geocaching involves hiding a small waterproof box containing a logbook and a pen , recording its co-ordinates and logging its location on a website			0
another ' cacher ' will see the listing , enter the co-ordinates into their gps receiver and go in search of it			0
it is similar to the 150 - year - old game letterboxing , which uses clues and references to landmarks embedded in stories			0
geocaching was invented in 2000 when gps readings became more accurate			0
in total there are two million geocaches all over the world and more than five million people take part in the activity globally			0
most members of the public are wary of bulls , but few realise that cows , particularly those protecting newly - born calves , can also be dangerous			0
@entity201 figures show that over 480 people have been injured by cows in the past eight years			0
last year @entity203 , 68 , died alongside her beloved golden @entity204 , @entity205 , after she was trampled by cows in a field near their home in @entity209 in @entity210			1
in 2009 the deaths of four people trampled by cows within a period of two months led the @entity214 to issue a warning			1
in june , vet @entity216 , 49 , was walking her dogs along the @entity218 , in @entity219 when she was charged by a herd and died			0
it is thought the animals became alarmed by her dogs , although they were on leads , because they were protecting their calves			2
in july , @entity225 , 63 , was walking with a friend in @entity227 , near @entity228 , when she fell among a herd			0
an inquest heard she was trying to put her dog back on its lead			0
that month , @entity233 , 65 , was also fatally attacked in @entity234 , @entity235			0

a farmer died from serious head and chest injuries after he was trampled by cows , which appear to have been scared by a fire engine in august			1
