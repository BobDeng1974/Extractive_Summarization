@entity15 refused to allow any contingency planning for @entity4 independence to take place before last september ’s referendum , not wanting to give the impression that the @entity21 was even contemplating defeat			2
@entity24 leader @entity44 , @entity4 ’s new first minister , has made scrapping @entity12 a condition of entering any sort of power - sharing deal with @entity48			1
the @entity49 insists it has no intention of moving the nuclear deterrent from the @entity34 naval base on the @entity53 and is committed to maintaining a continuous , submarine - based missile system to protect the @entity3			2
but sources have disclosed that work has now begun on the practicalities of shifting @entity3 ’s nuclear defence systems to @entity59 , should that prove necessary			2
@entity48 ’s first minister in @entity5 , @entity60 , is understood to have indicated he would be prepared to see @entity12 relocated to @entity61 , a natural deep water port			1
@entity3 has four @entity65 @entity64 submarines , based at @entity34 , which can deploy @entity12 ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads			2
one well - placed source said political leaders in @entity5 were keen for the @entity49 to ‘ look at @entity5 sites – not just @entity61 ’			1
@entity44 ( right ) said scrapping trident would be a condition of a power - sharing deal with @entity48 , while @entity5 first minister @entity60 is understood to have volunteered @entity61 as a replacement the source said it would be negligent not to prepare for all contingencies , given the @entity24 surge in @entity4 and the possibility of the party holding the balance of power			1

the @entity92 ’s spokesman said : ‘ our position on @entity12 is clear and unchanged			2
' @entity48 believes @entity3 should be leading international efforts for multilateral nuclear disarmament while maintaining a minimum , credible independent nuclear deterrent			1
’ however , one pro-nuclear @entity48 mp accused mr @entity87 of ‘ trying to be cute ’ , adding : ‘ he wants to carve a different position to that of the @entity103 but it ’s a dangerous game			1
