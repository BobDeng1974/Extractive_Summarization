human rights group cage has come under further scrutiny for the support it gives to a number of convicted terrorists , including radical @entity6 cleric @entity5 the campaign group that described @entity9 executioner @entity8 as a ' beautiful young man ' came under scrutiny today as it was revealed @entity12 charities are funding them to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds			1
human rights group cage sparked fury yesterday when its leader @entity17 claimed west @entity19 student @entity18 ' would n't hurt a fly '			1
today , it was revealed cage supports a number of convicted terrorists and other jihadis who remain at large - while collecting donations from some well - known @entity12 trusts			1
the @entity29 has donated more than £ 300,000 to the group , and the @entity31 - which distributes part of @entity35 founder @entity34 's fortune - has donated £ 100,000			1
critics have alleged that cage is an extremist organisation that promotes a radical @entity38 narrative and have questioned whether it could have done more to prevent @entity18 travelling to @entity39			2
former @entity41 detainee @entity40 , who was charged with terror offences , founded the @entity6 rights group			1
other individuals that cage offer support to include radical @entity6 cleric @entity5 and @entity48 - dubbed ' @entity47 '			1
it was also revealed today that @entity22 had its accounts with @entity51 and the @entity52 – and those of several of its board members – closed several weeks after @entity40 was arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences			2
the @entity29 handed the group a £ 300,000 donation in january 2014			1
a spokesman for the trust said : ' as a @entity61 trust , we reject and condemn all violence , including all violence for political ends			0
we believe that building sustainable security requires patient , long - term work to address the underlying causes of conflict and injustice			0
' @entity29 has previously funded cage to promote and protect human rights			1
we believe that they have played an important role in highlighting the ongoing abuses at @entity41 and at many other sites around the world , including many instances of torture			2
' @entity78 does not necessarily agree with every action or statement of any group that we have funded			2
' we believe that cage is asking legitimate questions about security service contact with those who have gone on to commit high - profile and horrific acts of violence , but this does not in any way absolve any such individual from responsibility for such criminal acts			2
' @entity22 and the @entity31 were both approached by @entity93 for comment , but have yet to reply			0
@entity22 described @entity9 executioner @entity8 as a ' beautiful young man ' who would n't hurt a fly			1
the killer is pictured with murdered @entity12 aid worker @entity98 the group is particularly animated about the case of @entity48 - dubbed ' @entity47 ' - who was jailed for 86 years in the @entity102 for attempting to murder @entity102 officials in @entity104			1
she had wide - ranging links to @entity107 and was married to a key plotter behind the 9/11 attacks			0
but @entity22 said it has ' dedicated itself to campaigning for @entity48 and her family in order to help secure their release and expose those involved in their abuse			2
' the group also represented the family of @entity119 - the man who butchered @entity120 in a @entity19 street in may 2013			2
@entity22 revealed that @entity119 had been harassed by the security services prior to his violent murder on the streets of @entity125 , south - east @entity19			0
the group is animated about the case of @entity48 ( both ) dubbed @entity47 , who was jailed for 86 years in the @entity102 for attempting to murder @entity102 officials in @entity104 the campaign group also defended radical @entity6 cleric @entity130 who was sentenced to life in prison by a court in @entity134 for supporting terrorism			1
he was convicted in may 2014 of multiple charges , including hostage - taking and plotting to set up a terrorism training camp in the @entity102			2
but cage called for him to be repatriated to @entity12 after the handless suspect appeared before a judge without the false limbs and complained that he wanted them back			1
at the time , mr @entity17 said : ' we would want to see him , if convicted , serving any sentence in the @entity12 , particularly when you consider the kind of treatment detainees face in @entity102 prisons			1
' @entity48 had wide - ranging links to @entity107 and was married to a key plotter behind the 9/11 attacks @entity17 , leader of cage , who helped to name @entity8 as west @entity19 student @entity18 , caused outrage yesterday by saying the @entity9 militant ' would n't hurt a fly ' others that cage support include @entity159 who was convicted in @entity160 as part of an @entity107 plot to carry out a suicide attack against a military base holding @entity102 soldiers			1
this comes to light as @entity22 representative @entity167 today told @entity169 he believes the @entity12 security forces played a role in radicalising @entity8			1
' he came to us after he felt he was being harassed by the security services ; he felt there was pressure being put on him and he could n't carry on with his ordinary life , ' mr @entity172 said			0
' we advised him on methods he could take if he was innocent to clear his name , we advised him to go to his mp , the @entity181 - he was very , very willing to engage with the system to try and get his name cleared			0
he sent letters to the embassies as to why he was being barred , he tried as much as he could to work through the system			0
' the @entity6 rights group was founded by former @entity41 detainee @entity40 ( pictured ) , who was charged with terror offences ' but the problem is you 've got a detached unaccountable security apparatus and there was no clear was for him to engage with that process and the lack of due process we think played a role in radicalising him			1
' anti-radicalisation organisation the @entity200 questioned whether the organisation could have done more to prevent @entity18 travelling to @entity39			0
' they seem to have had a relationship with him for three years - since before he went to @entity39 - and i simply do n't believe that nothing could have been done in that process to stop him , ' chief political liaison officer @entity211 told the @entity212			0
' it 's very , very important to uphold human rights in counter-extremism work , but for an organisation like @entity22 to focus entirely on grievances and allow those to be extrapolated in a radicalisation process is surely part of the problem and not part of the solution			0
' @entity22 has also supported @entity223 , who was sentenced to 13 years in 2005 after confessing to being part of the plot to blow up an aircraft with a shoe - bomb			0
it has also backed @entity228 , the convert also given 13 years for acts preparatory to terrorism			0
the @entity22 website demands solidarity for several jihadis who have been both tried and convicted , and for many more who are at large			0
it also supported @entity236 , who called for the killing of the @entity239 cartoonist , @entity240			0
@entity236 , who was killed by an @entity102 drone in september 2011 , is thought to have inspired the @entity243 attacks			0
the group also represented the family of @entity119 ( pictured ) - the man who butchered @entity120 in a @entity19 street in may 2013 @entity22 representative @entity172 ( pictured ) today told @entity169 he believes the @entity12 security forces played a role in radicalising @entity8 the @entity6 - focused human rights group lodged a formal complaint with the financial ombudsman last year after spending five months on a cash - only basis			1
it was one of a number of @entity6 pressure groups and charities to have had their accounts withdrawn by various banks			2
on the campaign group 's website , it says : ' cage has been campaigning against the @entity262 for more than a decade			1
' its work has focussed on working with survivors of abuse and mistreatment across the globe			0
its website is one of the leading resources documenting the abuse of due process and the erosion of the rule of law in the context of the @entity262			0
' @entity22 also supported @entity236 ( pictured ) , who called for the killing of the @entity239 cartoonist , @entity240			0
