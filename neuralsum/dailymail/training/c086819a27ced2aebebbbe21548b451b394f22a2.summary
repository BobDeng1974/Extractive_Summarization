what a night to remember for @entity1 's @entity0 in their resounding @entity4 victory against @entity5 on thursday night			1
the striker scored a hat - trick as @entity9 's side recorded their first win in the competition with a thumping 5 - 1 triumph at @entity13			1
the 21 - year - old endeared himself to the @entity1 faithful even further when he volunteered himself to go in goal following @entity18 ' dismissal in the closing stages of the match			1
@entity0 ended up in goal after @entity18 was sent off and conceded a late free - kick @entity0 had an eventful evening as @entity1 thrashed @entity5 5 - 1 in their @entity4 match with the hosts having made all their substitutes , @entity0 was soon left to rue that decision as he let @entity28 ' tame free - kick slip under his grasp and trickle into the bottom corner of the goal			1
any regular goalkeeper would have expected to make a routine save , but despite @entity0 's comical error he was ironically cheered by the @entity1 faithful who had witnessed a performance of promise from the @entity39 under 21 star			0
' it was a great night until i went in goal , ' he told @entity43 in his post-match interview afterwards			0
' in fairness i think i 'll leave that to the keepers from now on [ on his error to concede @entity51 ' consolation goal ]			0
it was a great result for us , a great win , and obviously i 'm happy to get the hat - trick			2
' @entity0 ( left ) gave @entity1 the lead with a blistering strike in the first half at @entity13 @entity0 ( centre ) doubled his goal tally for the night tapping home from close range in the 75th minute @entity0 ( right ) completed his first hat - trick for the club , heading home late on to make the scoreline 5 - 0 to @entity1 @entity0 's magic night began in the 13th minute when he unleashed a blistering right - footed drive from 25 - yards out that nestled into the bottom right - hand corner of @entity70 's goal			1
the strike was similar to the 21 - year - old 's opener against @entity74 in @entity1 's last @entity4 encounter and the effort provided the platform for a flurry of goals for the hosts			1
after two sublime goals from @entity82 , @entity0 was on the score sheet again with a close - range tap in after @entity70 had spilled @entity86 's stinging drive , to make the score 4 - 0			0
just minutes later the @entity1 academy graduate completed his first hat - trick for the club heading home @entity93 's cross to take home the match ball			2
@entity0 ( left ) went in goal for @entity1 in the dying stages of the match after @entity18 ( right ) was sent off @entity0 ( far right ) tries to organise his wall as @entity1 defend the free - kick that @entity18 gave away @entity0 ( centre ) fails to handle @entity28 ' tame free - kick as the ball slips under his grasp into the net reflecting on his three goals , @entity0 added : ' it [ the first ] was a sweet strike			1
when it left the foot i knew it had a chance and fortunately it came of the post and went in which is always nice			0
' i thought it was good to get the second and third as well , extra goals when the team is dead on their feet and when we want to start killing off teams and getting the five goals was great			0
' he 's evidently better at scoring goals than keeping them out , but on current form the 21 - year - old is pressing his claim for a starting birth in @entity9 's @entity131 team			2
@entity0 has now scored six goals in nine appearances for the club this season and with @entity1 at home to @entity136 next in the @entity131 - he 'll be looking to add to his tally if given the chance on sunday			0
despite his comical goalkeeping error @entity0 was pleased with a display that saw him collect the match ball @entity143 's goal was unbelievable - @entity9			0
