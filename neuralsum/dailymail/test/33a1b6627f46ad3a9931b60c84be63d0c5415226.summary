when @entity1 posted a picture of a signed contract for his $ 300 million mega-fight against @entity5 two months ago , there was a collective sigh of relief			1
after more than five years of wrangling and bickering , the richest fight in boxing history was finally set for may 2 in @entity12			1
but with 11 days to go until the two protagonists are due to touch gloves , not a single person has a ticket in their hands			0
@entity1 fights @entity5 next weekend but officially , no tickets are on sale that 's not to say that nobody has bought one ; @entity24 , which claims to be the world 's largest event ticket search engine , is selling briefs for up to $ 30,000 ( £ 20,000 )			1
these are known as ' spec tickets ' which the sellers do n't have but expect to get before the fight			2
the venue for the bout , the 16,500 - capacity @entity31 has the following message on its website : ' details on ticket sales coming soon ! please be aware that tickets for the may 2 , 2015 , @entity1 vs @entity5 fight are not yet available for purchase			1
' buyers should use extra caution when purchasing alleged tickets from unofficial sources , for fraudulent or counterfeit tickets will not be accepted			2
' so why the delay ? initially , @entity5 's promoter @entity47 said tickets would be on sale in the first week of april but that less than 1,000 - priced between $ 1,500 and $ 7,500 - were expected to be made available to the public			1
@entity5 's promoter @entity47 ( left ) has blamed @entity1 's side for the lack of tickets @entity54 , ceo of @entity55 , claimed they would be on sale last week the rest would be distributed by the fighters , promoters , television networks @entity61 and @entity62 and the @entity31			1
but last week , @entity24 analyst @entity63 said : ' it 's bizarre , normally there 's a public sale 10 weeks before the fight			1
to our knowledge no one has a printed ticket in their hands right now			0
' @entity63 went on to say that only a dozen tickets had been sold through the website at an average price of $ 8,000 ( £ 5,400 )			1
another ticketing site , @entity78 , are yet to put any tickets on sale			1
spokesperson @entity81 said : ' there 's still so much up in the air for this fight that we 're not allowing spec sales			0
we 're not willing to take that risk now			0
' as far as @entity47 is concerned , the blame lies squarely on @entity1 's side			2
' all of this is on the @entity91 ( @entity31 ) , i mean , if you think that the @entity91 is calling the shots here , you 're totally mistaken			2
it 's the man behind the curtain , ' he told @entity99 , alluding to @entity1 's adviser @entity100			2
@entity1 trains with his uncle @entity101 during a media workout in @entity12 last week @entity5 is taken on the pads by trainer @entity104 in front of the watching media ' this is going to the governor 's office			1
this is an absolute disgrace , what 's happening			0
' what do you want from me ? it 's not on us			0
' @entity5 's manager @entity117 has also expressed his frustration			2
he said : ' it 's a real mess right now			0
i can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets , otherwise why the holdup ? i 'm more than a little upset they 're not for sale to the public			1
' in the opposite corner , @entity55 ceo @entity54 has claimed @entity47 was lashing out because he is not the lead promoter in the fight			0
' every time he does n't get his way , he goes running to the press misrepresenting the facts , ' he said			0
' the bottom line is this : @entity47 can not stomach the fact that he is not the lead promoter			0
reality has set in , and this is typical @entity47			0
my responsibility is to ensure every deal is done properly , to benefit the fighters and the event			0
' it remains to be seen who will make up the 16,500 - capacity crowd at the @entity31 @entity54 did say that tickets would be on sale last week but there is no sign of an end to the stalemate			1
nor is there any indication of when the reported 50,000 closed - circuit seats at @entity91 properties - priced at around $ 150 ( £ 100 ) - in @entity12 will be available to purchase			1
the hotel 's website says simply : ' please check back for closed - circuit viewing availability at other @entity162			0
' in fact , the only ticket you can buy is for the weigh - in			1
priced at $ 10 , the unusual step has been taken in an effort to control the expected huge crowd but all proceeds will go to charity with each fighter nominating their choice			2
with @entity176 star @entity175 guaranteed the only free ticket from @entity47 and @entity178 set to be ringside next saturday as he eyes a future fight against either man , there will at least be a crowd of sorts			0
but who will join them is anyone 's guess .			0

@entity1 takes on @entity5 in @entity12 on may 2
but no tickets have been sold for the event at the @entity31
briefs are on sale on ticketing websites but the sellers do not have them
less than 1,000 are expected to go on public sale priced from $ 1,500
@entity1 - @entity5 weigh - in will be first ever with paid - for tickets
