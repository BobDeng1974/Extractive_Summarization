senior @entity0 were accused of a ‘ chicken run ’ from the @entity2 last night as three mps left the government so they can concentrate on holding their commons seats			1
after @entity8 minister @entity7 quit , @entity6 also had to find replacements for two @entity0 whips – @entity11 and @entity12 – who decided to stand down			1
@entity14 mps ridiculed their @entity2 partners for what they suggested was a misguided attempt to distance themselves from the government amid fears of a drubbing at may ’s general election			1
the steely home secretary overtook @entity36 in a poll of conservative members on who should be the next party leader			1
mr @entity33 backed mrs may , saying she was ‘ tough and robust ’ to deal with but that was her strength			0
of mr @entity7 ’s departure , the prime minister said scathingly : ‘ we ’ll cope without him			1
’ he added : ‘ i have worked with @entity31 for eight or nine years			2
she is a very effective politician , a very effective administrator			0
i want someone who is a tough home secretary – it ’s a tough world out there			1
’ chancellor @entity47 also dismissed mr @entity7 ’s resignation , mocking him in the @entity49 as a ‘ conspiracy theorist ’			2
mr @entity7 , a former transport minister , was appointed to the @entity8 last year after mr @entity6 axed @entity8 minister @entity51 , one of the leading figures on the @entity0 right			1
liberal democrat @entity7 arrives at the party 's hq in central @entity56 yesterday , a day after resigning as @entity8 minister mrs may was given no forewarning of his appointment , which was condemned as an ‘ elaborate @entity0 in - joke ’ by @entity14 mps			1
mr @entity7 has written a book , in which he suggested @entity64 weapons inspector dr @entity62 was murdered by an @entity66 hit squad and the incident was covered up by @entity69 security services			2
he has also said he believes the death of former @entity72 foreign secretary @entity71 may have been suspicious			0
government sources were astonished that mr @entity7 had been promoted to a position in which he was expected to work closely with the security services , having expressed such views			2
home secretary @entity31 was last night installed as the favourite to succeed @entity33 as @entity14 @entity13 cheered her for forcing out the ‘ eccentric ’ mr @entity7 announcing his resignation , mr @entity7 likened working with the home secretary to ‘ walking through mud ’ , accusing her of refusing to agree to his policy proposals			1
in particular , the two clashed over mr @entity7 ’s controversial suggestion that the possession of drugs should be decriminalised			2
he said : ‘ the home secretary was reluctant to let me have my head and it was a constant battle to try to get things through			1
‘ i have done it for a year , it is very hard work – the @entity8 is probably at the cutting edge of the @entity2			2
it is where most policy issues are difficult , whether it is @entity96 or immigration			0
it has not been helped by the lurch to the right from the conservative party as they chase @entity101 off to the fringes			0
’ mr @entity7 , a member of a rock band , the @entity103 , added : ‘ i want a break			2
i want to spend more time with my family , more time in my constituency , more time doing stuff i want to do , like my music			0
’ @entity14 sources said mr @entity7 was leaving to try to distance himself from the government and seek to defend his majority of 7,000 in @entity113 , under threat because of the @entity0 collapse in the polls			1
one said : ‘ he was never at the @entity8			2
he was only there two days a week			0
he spent most of mondays in his constituency and then he was away by thursday morning to prepare for his local radio show			0
’ the source added : ‘ he never got on with @entity31			2
i think he was one of those people who have trouble working for a powerful woman			0
he did not report to her			0
he came in and announced he was effectively the @entity0 home secretary			1
not surprisingly , he was told where to go			0
’ former @entity14 home office minister @entity124 said tensions had arisen because mr @entity7 had tried to act as if he had the same ministerial rank as mrs may			1
he said : ‘ he regarded himself as being on a par with the home secretary and asked for papers from other ministers – he wanted to check what everyone else was doing			1
’ ‘ the world does n’t work like that			0
he was a guitarist who was only interested in his own solos while the rest of the band was trying to play a close harmony number			0
’ but @entity0 president @entity141 complained : ‘ @entity31 behaves as though the @entity142 won the last election			1
they did n’t and it ’s an insult to the electorate to act as though they did			0
’ last night , a poll of members by the @entity150 website found mrs may has the backing of 24 per cent as the party ’s next leader – ahead of mr @entity36 , who has led for several months , on 22 per cent			0
mr @entity6 moved international development minister @entity154 , who worked at the @entity8 between 2010 and 2012 , back to her old department to replace mr @entity7			1
@entity7 ’s bitter parting shot at @entity31 was that , while he had been able to work perfectly amicably with @entity14 colleagues at the @entity158 , the @entity8 had been like ‘ walking through mud ’			1
undoubtedly , this is true			0
but if his resignation was timed to inflict maximum damage on mrs may – who has endured a wretched week , lurching from immigration scandals , to the ongoing sex abuse inquiry debacle – it backfired spectacularly			0
indeed , she will have positively purred at mr @entity7 ’s comment that she regards the @entity8 ‘ as a @entity142 department in a @entity142 government ’			1
mr @entity7 was said to have been kept on a short leash from the outset by the home secretary and her advisers she does – and many backbench @entity14 wish her @entity177 colleagues would take the same position , rather than pandering to @entity0 on the verge of electoral annihilation			1
mr @entity7 was kept on a short leash from the outset by the home secretary and her advisers			1
but should this really have come as a surprise to the @entity0 – and who can blame mrs may for not letting this political maverick loose in a department where one slip can be lethal ? the only mystery is why @entity6 ever considered mr @entity7 a suitable candidate to be sent to the @entity8 ( other than to irritate mrs may , who is his biggest enemy in the @entity177 )			1
on his first day in the job , mr @entity7 was forced to defend his oft - stated view – contained in a book he authored while not in government – that @entity69 spies covered up the murder of scientist dr @entity62 by an @entity66 hit squad			2
mrs may , who dominates her @entity8 department like no other cabinet minister in @entity201 it was hardly an auspicious start to life in the department which oversees @entity205 and it soon became clear there would be significant tensions with mrs may			2
mr @entity7 ’s two @entity0 predecessors at the @entity8 had caused her little trouble			1
@entity51 , on the right of mr @entity6 ’s party , was respected within the department and rarely strayed into controversy			0
@entity154 , who now returns to the department for a second stint , stuck to a brief covering equalities – on which she and mrs may largely agree			0
mr @entity7 , by contrast , wanted to find differences of opinion with the @entity14 – and for them to be known about publicly			1
he also wanted to behave like a ‘ @entity0 home secretary ’ , challenging the authority of mrs may , who dominates her department like no other cabinet minister in @entity201 and whose junior ministers very much understand their subordinate role			1
there was an initial skirmish on gun laws			0
mr @entity7 wanted to increase the £ 50 fee for a licence			2
the @entity14 , conscious of not upsetting the countryside , blocked him			2
he also went off on a tangent from time to time , accusing retailers of encouraging shoplifting by introducing self - service tills			0
but it was on drugs where the real bust - ups occurred			0
mrs may repeatedly thwarted his plans , including pilot projects for gp prescribing of heroin , licences for medical use of cannabis , and free foil to reduce the harm involved in injecting heroin			0
last week , she immediately binned a @entity8 review , which the @entity0 had insisted on commissioning , on the case for decriminalising the use of some drugs			1
some allies of mr @entity7 sought to portray this as the final straw , but he had been planning to walk away for a couple of months – not least because of the need to defend his vulnerable majority in @entity113 , @entity266			0
but he has done mrs may a huge favour with the manner of his departure and his complaints that she will not play nicely with her junior partners			0
the only loose cannon in her department has gone and her leadership credentials are , if anything , bolstered .			0

a total of three @entity0 mps have quit the government to focus on seats
whips @entity11 and @entity12 follow @entity7 in leaving
has been suggested they want to distance themselves from *coalition*
it comes amid fears the @entity0 could be in for an election drubbing
@entity7 resigned as @entity8 minister after clashing with @entity31
but the home secretary is still favourite to become next @entity14 leader
