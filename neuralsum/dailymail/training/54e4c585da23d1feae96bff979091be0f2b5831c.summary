by @entity0 published : 09:53 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 10:09 est , 1 november 2013 sharks have roamed the world 's seas for more than 420 million years and now scientists think they know one of the secrets of their longevity			1
experts believe they have solved the riddle of why sharks survived the mass extinction that began 252 million years ago , wiping out around 80 per of all life on @entity13			2
@entity15 evidence has hinted that the fish survived the global catastrophe , known as the ' great dying ' by diving deeper			2

early species of sharks were smaller and had unique teeth			0
pictured , is an illustration of falcatid shark , which is one of the cladodontomorph shark species a paleontological dig site in the @entity30 , containing sediment from a younger @entity33 ocean floor , has now revealed the teeth of a small shark ancestor , indicating that the fish swam into deeper oceans to seek refuge			1
one of the tiny t - shaped teeth typical of cladodontomorph sharks is less than a millimetre long and was discovered in 135 million - year - old rocks			1
experts have hypothesised that the sharks fled the acidic coastal waters of the end - @entity47 period to move to deeper oceans and lived there for a hundred million years			1
the research , which was published in @entity50 , is based on new evidence examining the anatomical study of the microscopic structure of animal tissues and morphological evidence - the structure of organisms			0
one of the tiny t - shaped teeth typical of cladodont sharks was less than a millimetre long and discovered in 135 million - year - old rocks @entity60 , a researcher at the @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63 , told @entity64 : ‘ it changes our view of how dramatic this extinction event was			1
' the find suggests that there may be many more fishes living in deep ocean sediment deposits that have n’t been found yet ( and that may indicate that the ) extinction was n’t that dramatic for cartilaginous fishes ( such as sharks )			0
’ the study reveals that the recorded gap in the cladodontomorph shark lineage represents the longest gap in the fossil record for an extinct marine vertebrate group			0
the report says : ' this discovery demonstrates that the deep - sea marine diversity , poorly known during most of the fish evolutionary history , contains essential data for a complete understanding of the long - term evolution of marine fish paleobiodiversity			0
the three species of cladodontomorph were relatives of modern sharks , rays and skates			0
the new findings suggest that modern sharks might have survived the great dying in a similar way - by moving to deeper areas in the ocean			1
however , dr @entity60 said there is no fossil evidence to prove that modern sharks swam to deeper waters .			0
