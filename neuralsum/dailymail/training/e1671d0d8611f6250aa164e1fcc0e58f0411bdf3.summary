by @entity0 a ' bold initiative ' which will see drivers banned from overtaking cyclists on designated ' cycle streets ' could be introduced in cities throughout the @entity6 in a bid to reduce the number of road deaths			1
the proposed move would introduce a new 15mph speed limits on certain roads , where cyclists would also be given priority over motorists			1
under the government plans , police would be able to issue a £ 100 fine or three penalty points to any drivers who flout the new rules			1
it is the latest move in a string of measures attempting to reduce some of the 19,000 injuries which are caused to cyclists on the @entity6 roads each year			1
the scheme , which has been championed by the roads minister @entity46 , has been laid out in a consultation document issued by the @entity22			2
in the document it says : ' this is a bold initiative , which is being considered by some of the cycle cities and @entity33 , possibly including a ban on overtaking on lightly - trafficked roads where cycle flows are high			1
' subject to any scheme trial , this prohibition could be accompanied by an advisory speed limit of 15 mph is being considered by some of the cycle cities and @entity33 , possibly including a ban on overtaking on lightly - trafficked roads where cycle flows are high '			1
' cycle streets ' are already widely used in the @entity62 and @entity63 to give priority to cyclists over motorists on minor streets			1
but in the @entity62 , cycle streets are only used where cyclists outnumber motorists by two to one , a situation rarely seen in @entity6			1
other measures included in the consultation include creating pedestrian and cycle zones where they are currently known as ‘ no motor vehicles ’ zones			2
it would mean cyclists are allowed in areas where cars are banned			2
the consultation also proposes introducing a new priority crossings for cyclists			1
the scheme is likely to be introduced in @entity33 and the @entity6 's so - called ' cycle cities ' , which include @entity34 , @entity37 , @entity39 and @entity38 upon @entity85 under the plan , cycle routes would be placed next to zebra crossings markings , forcing drivers to give way to cyclists when crossing between cycle lanes			1
the consultation on the document ends next month , meaning the scheme could be implemented before the general election			0
over the past few years , several other measures have been developed in a bid to increase road safety for cyclists			0
last year , a new electronic laser device that creates a bike lanes for a cyclist was unveiled by @entity104 , a company based in the @entity105			0
last year , the cyclist 's @entity107 - an electronic laser device which creats a bike lane in the dark - was unveiled by @entity104 , a compnay based in the @entity105 the cyclist 's @entity111 , which is the same size as a deck of cards , mounts to the rider 's saddle post and uses a laser to project two lines either side of the bicycle			0
the tiny device is visible under headlights or streetlights and gives motorists an indicator of where the cyclist is			0
the red lane begins at the bike 's seat and extends past the rear wheel - giving drivers a clear sight of the space they need to allocate to the cyclist			0
earlier this year , new bike lights designed by behavioural scientist and keen cyclist @entity136 that display the international symbol of the cyclist were hailed as a major breakthrough in road safety			0
research carried out by the @entity143 suggests the bike symbol distinguishes cyclists from the blizzard of lights that streak the roads up and down the country			1
the @entity150 is also building super cycle highways around the capital , to reduce congestion and increase safety on the roads			2
four of the 12 planned super highways have already been built			0
over the last decade , cycling has grown in @entity33 alone by 70 per cent			0
on major roads , the number of cyclists has increased by 173 per cent			2
this still only translates to two per cent of all journeys and falls short of many other @entity6 and @entity164 cities			2
but road safety is still a key factor			0
between 2006 and 2011 , the number of cycling casualties rose by half			0
cycling accounts for 20 per cent of deaths and serious casualties on the roads .			0

under @entity177 proposals , existing roads would turn into ' cycle streets '
the chosen roads would give cyclists priority and have a 15mph speed limit
police could hand out fines to motorists who flout the new overtaking ban
some 19,000 cyclists are injured on roads around the @entity6 every year
