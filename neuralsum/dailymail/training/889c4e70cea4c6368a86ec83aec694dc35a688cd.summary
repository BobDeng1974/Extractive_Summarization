@entity52 's ms @entity65 said that the organisation had contacted the company nearly two years ago , drawing attention to the inappropriate merchandise , and were told that there was a ' computer glitch ' that had allowed the products to fall through the cracks			1

' every time someone alerts them to the issue , they say that they had no idea , and promise to do something , but have failed repeatedly , ' she said			0
two of @entity52 's spokespeople tested the company 's promise a month after it was made , and were able to not only order , but receive in the mail , baby onesies with the slogans ' @entity184 all i need is the @entity187 ' , and ' incest : good thing it 's illegal otherwise everyone and their sister would be doing it			2
' at least one item available on @entity0 with pornographic content was specifically designed for a baby , with a onesie featuring the slogan ' no , my mommy does not like it in the ass			2
i 'm here , are n't i ? '			0
after spotting the ' @entity204 ' shirt this week , ms @entity65 contacted the company via @entity122 to seek immediate action , and was told that ' like before			2
. you must contact our content usage department for further assistance			0
' ms @entity65 and other @entity122 users were quick to point out that it was not their responsibility to draw the company 's attention to their own products , and raised the point that the items should not have been created in the first place			2

‘ i think it ’s a massive issue using children 's clothing to promote what they would called ' adult sexual humour ' , even though it 's clearly rape ' humour ' , ' ms @entity65 said			1
' it 's highly inappropriate , and not just distasteful but entirely unacceptable , ' she said			0
' the ' @entity204 ' slogan did not come out of nowhere , it came from fraternities at @entity40 who stood outside women 's dorms and yelled it at them			0
' ms @entity65 said that the slogan normalises serious crimes against women and makes it more difficult for people to have empathy for victims and survivors of sexual assault and rape			1
‘ imagine being a victim of rape or sexual violence and seeing this slogan , ' ms @entity65 said			2
' this is inhumane violence that has been done to you , and other people are seeing it as a punchline			0
