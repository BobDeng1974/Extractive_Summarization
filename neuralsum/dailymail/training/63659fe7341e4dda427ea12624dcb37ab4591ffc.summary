after the week he ’s had , it might come as some consolation to @entity3 that he will not be the only one under the microscope at the @entity5 on saturday lunchtime			1
a two - goal hero for @entity9 but too average for @entity10 , it is perhaps inevitable that @entity12 ’s new £ 16million signing makes his debut in one of the biggest games of the season so far			1
with @entity42 coming under scrutiny , not to mention increasing pressure from his deputy @entity45 , and @entity46 returning to @entity12 for the first time since signing off with victory in last season ’s @entity50 final , there are certainly plenty of storylines			1
‘ look , they got @entity46 , ’ said @entity26 , who had previously questioned whether the @entity54 had been the subject of an illegal approach from saturday ’s opponents			1
‘ i am sorry he left us because i absolutely tried to keep him			2
he was a very good player and could cover us in central defence			2
he could have gone even if @entity22 did not exist			1
he could have gone somewhere , @entity62 , anywhere			2
’ @entity21 is ready to make his debut for @entity22 after joining from @entity30 this summer former @entity12 defender @entity46 will return to the @entity5 on saturday what kind of a reception will he get ? ‘ a good one , ’ replied the @entity12 manager			1
@entity26 has every reason to approach the early kick - off with some trepidation			1
in three of their 12.45pm kick - offs last season , @entity12 were beaten 6 - 3 by @entity22 , 5 - 1 by @entity73 and 6 - 0 by @entity30			1
it would be enough to scar any player psychologically , but @entity26 insists the timings were not to blame			0
‘ i never honestly thought it was the kick - off time that cost us the games , ’ he said			2
‘ it was the performances			0
the poor performance was not linked with the kick - off times			2
‘ we live in a society where you need to find explanations for everything			0
let ’s not forget we are competitive people and sometimes when your opponent is better than you , you lose			0
it would n’t matter if we played at 9pm at night or 12.45pm , they were better than us			0
‘ that was not , in my opinion , down to the kick - off time			2
let ’s not make a psychological problem of it			2
what is very difficult psychologically is to lose the games			0
in my job , the most important thing is always to find the right reasons and i do n’t think it was to do with the early kick - off time			2
‘ i think we were beaten last year because we were not aggressive enough in those games			0
we were not mobile enough and lost too many challenges			0
as a unit , we were beaten all over the place			0
we were 2 - 0 down after 10 minutes ( against both @entity30 and @entity73 )			1
‘ you are in the position then that you have to take a huge gamble to come back and you open yourself up			0
’ @entity26 insists the timings of last season 's kick - off times did n't have an affect on @entity12 's results @entity34 was at pains to point out that last season ’s thumping win over the @entity28 will count for no more than @entity12 ’s 3 - 0 win in the @entity120 last month			1
‘ absolutely , ’ he said			0
‘ different games , different competitions , different moments			0
remember that when we played @entity120 we had nine players out of the team because they arrived too late to play			0
’ this will be @entity22 ’s first game since allowing @entity129 to join @entity130 on transfer - deadline day , effectively limiting them to three recognised strikers until january at the earliest			1
one of them , @entity134 , is currently sidelined with a hamstring strain			0
@entity22 allowed striker @entity129 to leave for @entity130 on transfer deadline day the decision to off - load @entity129 was , said the @entity22 boss , driven by the financial fair play penalty limiting the number of foreign players in his @entity143 squad and the player ’s desire to return to @entity147			1
so would @entity34 not have been interested in a young @entity148 from across town like @entity3 ? he did not dismiss the idea out of hand			1
‘ at that moment no , because we had @entity129 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity156 - four strikers , ’ he said			2
‘ now we have one player less but we had less choice and could not spend the money			0
‘ we ’re not only interested in @entity148 players , we ’re interested in players of all nationalities if they are good players			0
@entity22 manager @entity34 says the club are interested in players of all nationalities ‘ @entity12 are a very strong team with @entity166 , a very important player , and now with @entity3			1
’ today ’s clash marks the start of an important week for both clubs as they both head to @entity170 for @entity143 games , @entity12 to face @entity172 and @entity22 to take on @entity173			1
for now , though , all eyes are on the @entity33 title race			0
and @entity3 will not be the only one in the spotlight .			1
