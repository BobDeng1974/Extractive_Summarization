by @entity0 published : 11:26 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 04:49 est , 5 january 2013 as if the flooding and transport chaos has n’t been bad enough already , now drivers face a new weather - related menace – potholes			1
and it has come at a hefty price			0
motorists are paying out more than £ 1billion a year on car repairs to rectify the damage caused by cracks and pits in the roads			1
record - breaking wet weather from last year has resulted in an ‘ enormous increase ’ in the number of potholes			1
last month , an @entity20 survey found that drivers and cyclists had to tackle an average of just over six potholes per mile			2
motorists are paying out more than £ 1bn a year on car repairs to rectify the damage caused by cracks and pits in the roads			1
above , a long rift opened up along the @entity30 in @entity31 today , exposing layers of dirt and gravel as parts of the surface sank a study by @entity38 found that 8m vehicles a year suffer steering and suspension damage as a result of poorly - maintained road surfaces but following december ’s downpours , many road surfaces have deteriorated further			1
a study by @entity38 found that 8million vehicles a year suffer steering and suspension damage as a result of poorly - maintained road surfaces – with one driver affected every four seconds			1
the average repair bill is estimated to cost £ 135			2
the figures show that last month complaints over potholes almost doubled since a year ago			1
councils were being notified at a rate of 54 a day in december , a 60 per cent increase on the average for the year			1
blame the weather : rain and floods in many parts of the country have cause more potholes than ever to appear on @entity65 's roads the recent wet weather has made a bad situation worse			1
in @entity70 , one stretch of road was torn apart after days of heavy rain			2
a long rift opened up along the @entity30 in @entity31 , exposing layers of dirt and gravel as parts of the surface sank			0
with two - feet wide cracks in places , the through - road has now been sealed off by engineers			2
@entity81 , @entity20 head of roads policy , said : ‘ the wet weather has had a massive impact on our roads			0
our patrols are reporting an enormous increase in the amount of potholes			2
the heavy rain will have aggravated those that are already there , and brought about new ones			0
no through route : the figures were revealed as it emerged a landslide left a bridge connecting the tiny village of @entity101 , @entity102 , to a major commuter route impassable - adding ten miles to residents ' journeys cracked : the stone bridge has been left twisted and crumbling with huge cracks in the tarmac inconvenience : rain towards the end of december caused the bridge to sink down an embankment and it has been shut ever since ‘ but it will also have affected the substructure of the road - in some instances we have even seen the base of the road washed away			1
‘ and it is still early days			0
once we have freezing weather , we will see frost and ice causing further damage to the road surface			1
‘ the full scale of the problem will only emerge in the next few months			0
’ last year , the @entity130 , which carries out an annual road maintenance survey , found the number of potholes filled in across @entity134 and @entity135 had nearly doubled in five years , to almost 1.7million			1
a spokesman said : ‘ what we are hearing is that the extreme rain fall that we have experienced this year has had quite a devastating effect on the roads			1
‘ we have seen huge areas of the country where the ground has been saturated , and this affects the foundations of the roads			0
' it will certainly be expensive to repair and we would not be surprised to see increasing numbers of potholes and serious cracks as a result			0
’ many local authorities have been warning motorists that potholes are on the rise as a result of the wet weather			0
following the recent flooding in the south west , councils said up to £ 20million is needed to repair the damage to the region ’s roads			1
@entity166 estimates the repair bill will cost taxpayers £ 10million , while authorities in @entity170 have earmarked £ 7million for the damage caused by the downpours in november and december			2
counting the cost : rectifying the damage caused by potholes , such as these in @entity177 , @entity178 , left , and @entity179 , north @entity180 , right , can be unexpectedly costly , with an average repair bill of £ 135 disparity : some regions had far higher incidences of pothole damage than others			1
pictured : potholes in @entity188 , left , and @entity189 , right @entity190 also expects long - term costs of up to £ 3million			2
austerity measures will see road maintenance grants fall by almost £ 100million this year , and as a result many councils are being forced to mend rather than replace damaged roads			1
over the long term , the estimated cost to ‘ patch and mend ’ rather than to plan proper road maintenance is 20 times greater			0
last month ministers announced an extra £ 215million for councils to carry out repairs , from money put aside for roads in chancellor @entity207 ’s @entity206			2
the figures were revealed as it emerged a landslide left a bridge connecting the tiny village of @entity101 , @entity102 , to a major commuter route impassable - adding ten miles to residents ' journeys			1
the stone bridge has been left twisted and crumbling with huge cracks in the tarmac			0
the closure restricts access to the @entity221 which links @entity102 to @entity222			2
rain towards the end of december caused the bridge to sink down an embankment and it has been shut ever since			1
expensive : drivers from the @entity228 being hit hardest with a £ 181 million bill , closely followed by motorists in the @entity231 who pay out around £ 175 million for repairs the village is still accessible from the south via @entity235 but traffic from @entity237 is being diverted via @entity238			0
residents said the bridge , which has a 7.5ft weight limit and is listed , has been put under considerable strain as a result of heavy farm traffic driving over it			0
@entity246 from @entity38 said : ' even hitting a small pothole can easily damage wheels , tyres and affect steering alignment but serious suspension damage is becoming a more common occurrence			0
' from bent anti-roll bars to damaged shock absorbers , the problems are exacerbated by three factors ; the inability of local authorities to keep pace with highway maintenance , an ageing vehicle fleet more susceptible to damage as drivers keep cars for longer and component complexity , which drives up the cost of each individual repair			0
' some regions had far higher incidences of pothole damage than others , with drivers from the @entity228 being hit hardest with a £ 181 million bill , closely followed by motorists in the @entity231 who pay out around £ 175 million for repairs			0
those areas where drivers are least likely to encounter costly problems are @entity135 and the @entity278 where the repair bills for pothole - related damage are £ 53 million and £ 58 million respectively - though lower traffic density , rather than better quality of road surface , may be masking the true underlying threat			1
councils , local authorities and the @entity287 have a duty of care under @entity290 to take reasonable measures to ensure that problems such as potholes are found and dealt with swiftly			2
however , since the initial cost of pothole repairs is borne by the driver it is they who must prove the relevant authority has failed to meet this obligation in order to make a claim , which is time consuming and far from straight - forward			0
typically any driver seeking to recoup repair costs must prove that the relevant authority does not have a robust system for dealing with road surface issues , or that it fails to meet the national recommended code of practice for highway maintenance			0
mr @entity246 added : ' the funding gap is hitting motorists hard			0
this is clearly not sustainable in the long term and we are currently looking for ways in which we can support drivers who encounter potholes whilst the authorities remain unable or unwilling to act			0

8m vehicles a year - one every four seconds - suffer damage *due* to potholes
december 's rain played havoc on @entity65 's roads , causing more to break up
complaints over potholes double compared to the same period a year ago
councils receive 54 complaints a day , a 60 *%* increase on the year average
landslide *wrecks* bridge in @entity102 leaving village 's only road impassable
