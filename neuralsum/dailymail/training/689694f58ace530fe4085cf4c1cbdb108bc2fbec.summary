@entity1 's opposition to all things @entity3 includes having no representative from the @entity5 on the technical study group that analyses all 64 matches of the @entity8			1
instead the 13 - strong group , whose report after the tournament always has much importance attached to it , includes representatives from football outposts such as @entity16 and @entity17 who have never been near a @entity8 finals			1
other countries whose delegates will be running the rule over @entity25 ’s methods in training as well as games include @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			2
thinker : @entity35 was due to take part in @entity38 's @entity37 for @entity39 former @entity41 manager @entity40 had been a long - time member of @entity1 ’s @entity37 at six previous @entity42 while @entity25 boss manager @entity35 helped compile the technical report for the 2006 @entity8 and was due to be part of @entity38 ’s @entity37 for @entity39 until taking over the national team beforehand			1
however , the only member of the 2014 report team with any allegiance to @entity50 football is @entity52 ’s @entity51 , the former @entity53 manager			1
asked about the conspicuous absence of a @entity3 representative , a @entity1 spokeswoman said : ‘ the @entity37 members are alternating from @entity8 to @entity8			1
this time there is no @entity3 as other countries are represented			1
’ running the rule : former @entity53 boss @entity51 is among the 13 - man group lt has taken only one day for the police - escorted @entity25 commute from @entity65 hotel to training base to take longer than the time considered acceptable			1
that was 30 to 40 minutes and after a 39 - minute trip on monday , the route took 45 minutes on tuesday			1
the @entity71 blamed the police outriders turning up late and a spokesman said : ‘ the manager is happy with the journey , which is the most important thing			2
’ @entity76 , interviewed by @entity77 for tuesday night ’s @entity79 documentary @entity78 , said it would be no surprise to see @entity25 in the @entity8 final because of their experience			0
however , this is the same @entity76 who had @entity85 as player of the tournament in 2002 before @entity25 ’s quarter - final exit			2
looking tidy : the @entity71 are looking to extend their kit deal with @entity90 the @entity71 are planning to start talks about a new kit deal with @entity90 well in advance of the @entity96 finals despite the contract running until 2018			2
and the @entity71 will want far more control in future following concern inside @entity101 at how they copped the blame for the £ 90 replica kit , including the wrath of prime minister @entity106 , rather than the kit suppliers			0
all signs are pointing to the @entity109 being the most shambolic tournament in @entity1 history			0
@entity71 delegates , including chairman @entity112 , took up to four hours to travel from @entity114 airport to the @entity1 congress location outside the gridlocked city with others taking even longer			0
the gift of a @entity120 watch and a @entity122 football will not compensate			2
and a mass demonstration by more than 100,000 locals — disgruntled at the cost of the @entity8 — is due to take place in @entity65 on thursday to coincide with the opening game			0
delayed : @entity112 was among those held up in @entity114 no wonder @entity1 officials are keeping their passes out of sight , vip transport has no @entity1 branding and president @entity134 has a huge security detail around him			0
the chaos is summed up by @entity137 , the editor of local weekly magazine @entity138 : ‘ we are the country of winging it			0
we plan poorly , monitor even worse , leave everything to the last hour and believe it will work out in the end			0
until , one day , it does n’t			0
’ the odious @entity146 , @entity50 - hating former overlord of @entity149 football who severed all connections from the game in 2012 under the weight of corruption scandals , is understood to have used what remains of his influence to shore up his daughter @entity157 ’s executive director position on the @entity8 ’s local organising committee			1
her place was under threat following her rash @entity163 comment — especially given her father ’s situation — about @entity8 money being ‘ stolen ’ .			0

no @entity3 representative in 13 - strong study group for @entity149
@entity5 snubbed in *favour* of *minnows* who have never been to finals
former @entity53 boss @entity51 the only one with any allegiance to @entity50 football among group
