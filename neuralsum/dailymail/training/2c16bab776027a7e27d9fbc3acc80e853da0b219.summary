that is what you need in football – to face this opposition			2
‘ i thought we were really fluent last week , we just did n’t get the second goal that would have given us that cushion			0
until you play against sides like @entity15 and @entity16 , you do n’t have the answers on the pitch			1

i would n’t go in to discussing where we can be at the end of the season			2
’ @entity2 , meanwhile , is confident key midfielder @entity85 will be back before october after ruling out the prospect of him spending five months on the sidelines with medial ligament damage			1
‘ he is as you would expect , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ @entity85 is such a strong boy he has recovered quicker than you would expect but there is still some swelling around the knee and we are taking our time			0
‘ i do n’t know where five months came from			0
he has a partial tear of his medal ligament			0
it can take time and i ’m sure @entity85 will be quicker than normal in his recovery but it could be seven , eight or nine weeks			0
you just do n’t know with that type of injury			0
’ @entity2 , meanwhile , believes @entity32 – who scored @entity8 ’s first goal of the season with a thumping effort at the @entity108 – could be ready to step into @entity85 ’s shoes			1
