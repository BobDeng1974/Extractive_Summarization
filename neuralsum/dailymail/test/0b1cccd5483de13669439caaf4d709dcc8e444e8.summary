amid a torrent of rumours surrounding @entity3 and his managerial future , the @entity0 quietly continued a phenomenal career trend on thursday with @entity6			1
he took the @entity8 side into the @entity10 semi-final with an emphatic 6 - 3 aggregate victory over @entity12 and the impending encounters against @entity14 will be @entity3 's seventh major @entity16 semi-final in 12 seasons			1
@entity6 are the fourth club he has taken to the latter stages of a @entity16 competition , following spells with @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity3 ( right ) celebrates taking @entity6 into the @entity10 semi-final with striker @entity26 @entity3 ( centre ) has reached his seventh @entity16 semi-final in only 12 seasons with four teams @entity3 ( right ) guided @entity23 to @entity31 glory in 2005 , his first season at the club @entity3 got @entity23 back to the final of the competition in 2007 , where they were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity37 2004 : @entity10 winner ( @entity22 ) 2005 : @entity31 winner ( @entity23 ) 2007 : @entity31 finalist ( @entity23 ) 2008 : @entity31 semi ( @entity23 ) 2010 : @entity10 semi ( @entity23 ) 2013 : @entity10 winner ( @entity24 ) 2015 : @entity10 semi ( @entity6 ) @entity3 tasted continental success for the first time with @entity22 in 2004 , lifting what was then the @entity10 after beating a @entity49 side spearheaded by @entity50 2 - 0 in the final			1
that achievement , alongside the two @entity54 titles he won during his three - year spell at the @entity56 , caught the eye of @entity23 , who swooped to bring the @entity0 in as @entity60 's replacement			0
his first @entity62 season was one of adjustment but in @entity65 , @entity3 flourished			0
he recorded his most stunning glory to date , masterminding what on paper was a woefully uninspiring @entity23 team to @entity31 glory , overcoming a star - studded @entity37 side that boasted the likes of @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 in the final			0
@entity3 maneuvered @entity23 back to the @entity31 final in 2007 , eliminating @entity80 on the way with a win at the @entity83 , only for @entity37 to avenge their defeat two years prior with a 2 - 1 victory			0
the @entity0 manipulated another assault on @entity65 's elite trophy the following year but @entity23 were knocked out in the semi-final by @entity24			0
off - field ownership turmoil derailed @entity3 's team and @entity23 have not even threatened to emerge as a challenger for club football 's most prestigious competition since			1
they were eliminated in the group stage of the tournament in 2010 , where a third - placed finish resulted in demotion to the @entity10			0
but @entity3 guided @entity23 to the semi-finals of @entity65 's secondary competition , where a @entity102 strike in extra-time at @entity104 sent @entity105 to the final , where they beat @entity108 's @entity107			2
the @entity0 was sacked as @entity23 manager at the end of the 2010 season and @entity108 replaced @entity3 , who ended up at @entity24 as interim manager in 2012 via a short spell at @entity114			2
@entity3 won the @entity10 with @entity24 , beating @entity115 in the final , but his stay at @entity118 was always going to be a short one			2
@entity3 often barbed @entity24 supporters while at @entity104 and with @entity123 's time at @entity124 grinding to a halt , it was clear who @entity3 was keeping the @entity24 hotseat warm for			0
now at @entity6 , @entity3 finds his future at the club in question due to meandering domestic form			2
@entity6 are currently fourth in @entity8 , five points away from the top three ( which equals @entity31 qualification in @entity135 ) with seven games remaining until the end of the season , when the @entity0 's contract expires			1
@entity3 was not a popular choice at @entity24 but he still delivered silverware with the @entity10 @entity3 first won the trophy with @entity22 in 2004 shortly before moving to @entity23 @entity3 is out of contract at @entity6 at the end of the season and has been linked with @entity144 @entity3 has been linked with a return to @entity146 with @entity144 , as @entity147 has overseen a feeble attempt at defending their @entity62 title , while some @entity23 fans even pine for him to return to @entity104			1
if @entity3 does leave @entity6 at the end of the season , he will surely have an array of suitors			1
he has 12 major honours to his name			0
few coaches across @entity65 posses a record as imposing as his .			0

@entity3 's contract at @entity6 expires at the end of the season
he guided the @entity135 side to the @entity10 semi-final on thursday
he has taken four teams to a @entity16 semi-final inside 12 years
