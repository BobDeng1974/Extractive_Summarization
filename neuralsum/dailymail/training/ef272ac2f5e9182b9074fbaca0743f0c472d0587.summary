by @entity1 reporter seek and destroy : the lethal predator drone is 27ft long and comes armed with hellfire missiles drones are used for lethal and non-lethal purposes : they can track drug smugglers , monitor borders and search for earthquake victims , and environmentalists use them to catch illegal whalers and loggers			1
but hundreds of drones have crashed in the last 14 years with documents uncovered by the @entity14 that show many catastrophes have been narrowly averted , often by a few feet , or a few seconds , or pure luck			1
military drones have slammed into homes , farms , runways , highways , waterways and , in one of the most serious accidents an @entity27 @entity26 transport plane collide with a drone in midair			1
the driving force behind the most sophisticated drones remains the military , who use them for spying and killing			1
their proliferation has led to thousands of deaths , the disruption of entire communities and increased political instability			2
in august 2011 , the enormous transport place was descending towards @entity41 , in eastern @entity42 when suddenly it crashed into the drone			2
' @entity45 s * * t ! ' yelled the @entity26 ’s navigator , ' we got hit by a uav ! hit by a uav ! ' the unmanned aerial vehicle ( @entity48 ) was being flown remotely by a crew on the ground and smashed into the cargo plane ’s left wing between two propellers			2
jet fuel came pouring out of the wing			2
luckily the crew of the @entity26 were able to shut down an engine and landed within two minutes of the accident happening			2
a week later , he was the pilot of a predator that crashed into a @entity72 military base			1
the precise cause of the crash was undetermined the impact left an enormous hole in planes ' wing			2
about 50 seconds later , the drone operator came across the radio to inform the control tower he had lost track of his aircraft			1
the tower was able to set him straight			2
' we had a , ah , @entity26 , um , that hit a uav			2
i ’m suspecting that it ’s yours			2
' the official finding of what caused the crash was censored			0
some of the documents obtained by the @entity14 indicate the air - traffic controller was at least partly blamed			1
military officials said there has been only one other case of a midair drone collision , involving a helicopter and a small , hand - launched drone in @entity102 a decade ago but there have been more plenty of other incidents on the ground			1
in one accident in @entity42 , armed predator drones crashed near residential areas in the city of @entity111 twice in the space of six months			1
the first time , the drone smashed into a housing complex			0
the second was into a row of shipping containers			0
the military paid compensation to those who were affected			0
mistake : an @entity42 housing compound that was destroyed in another @entity72 military drone crash in @entity111 later that year @entity72 navy sailors and @entity125 soldiers retrieve a drone after it had crashed into the sea off the			1
. southern @entity125 city of @entity129 on another occasion , a drone was slammed into a 17,000 foot mountain because the ' pilot ' was distracted by storm clouds			0
maintenance of the drones has also been a cause of some accidents			1
a broken propeller downed one of the machines			0
in other instances a drone was flown by an inexperienced officer who forgot to turn the stabilizer on ( or perhaps unforgivably , turned it off ! ) the unmanned aircraft took a nose dive soon after takeoff - and it was all caught on camera			1
part of the reasons for so many accidents was the design of the predator drone			0
it had only one engine , one alternator , one propeller			0
if any of those parts failed , the plane would come down			0
collision : in one of the more shocking incidents , a drone flew into the wing of a @entity26 military transport plane			0
the plane was just minutes from touching down , m but it could have resulted in a very serious accident in september 2004 armed insurgents are holding parts of a @entity170 remote controlled drone			0
the @entity72 military cited mechanical failure as the most likely cause of the crash technology : the @entity178 's infrared camera can identify a human from 10,000ft in the air on six occasions between 2006 and 2012 , records show , pilots intentionally flew straight into the side of a mountain after their aircraft ’s engines began to fail			1
the thinking was it would be safer to fly into the ground in a remote area than risk some kind of attempt at landing where the drone could fall on someone			0
they 're prone to bad weather such as high wind , lightening and icing			0
a drone fell into the sea after chunk of ice fell off the tail			0
following the 9/11 attacks on @entity206 in 2001 , the @entity72 military filled its shopping trolleys with every type of drone on the production line and commissioned new ones			1
in 2000 , the @entity212 had fewer than 50 drones			1
a decade later , that number had soared to nearly 7,500			1
most were used for surveillance , but the number of weapons strikes kept increasing , from 74 in 2007 to 839 by 2012			0
they bought the 38in - long @entity219 which fits in a rucksack and can be launched by throwing it into the air			1
they invested in the 27ft - long predator with its hellfire missiles , and later the more powerful reaper version			1
@entity228 security personnel examine a crashed @entity72 surveillance drone some two kilometres inside @entity228 territory in the town of @entity232 in the insurgency - hit @entity233 in august 2011 powerful : the @entity236 model can ling in the air for about 18 hours but others have an endurance of weeks the @entity178 ’s infrared camera can identify the heat of a human from 10,000ft in the air , so from 8,000 miles away in @entity244 a drone ‘ pilot ’ or operator can watch an @entity42 as he lights a cigarette or talks to friends			1
then the @entity72 bought the 40ft - long @entity250 with its long - range surveillance capability of 40,000 square miles a day			1
drones can fly low and slow over hostile terrain , and hover for hours , or all day if need be			2
the @entity236 can linger in the air for about 18 hours			0
others have an endurance of weeks			0
then there is the vulture			0
solar panels cover its massive 400ft wingspan and enable it to stay in the air for up to five years			0
@entity262 has already produced a prototype for its @entity265 drone , roughly the size of a fighter jet , which flies itself			0
since the drone program began , the @entity27 has acquired 269 @entity269			0
going nowhere : more than 400 large @entity72 military drones have crashed in major accidents around the world since 2001 , a record of calamity that exposes the potential dangers of throwing open @entity72 skies to drone traffic the company that makes the drones says a redesign with two engines is simply not possible because of the enormous amount of design work it would entail			1
the @entity27 has acknowledged that @entity269 crash more frequently than regular military aircraft , but officials said the drone ’s safety record has improved markedly			0
sometimes , the planes simply disappear			0
few carry transponders that work when the electrical power has failed because of the extra weight			0
because the drones are piloted wirelessly , their signals are also prone to interruption			2
sometimes the outage can last a few minutes			0
unreliable ? drones have malfunctioned in multiple ways , plummeting from the sky because of mechanical breakdowns , human error , bad weather the planes are supposed to return to base automatically or fly around in circles until communication is restored			2
but sometimes , the drones are simply lost - and the screens back at base go blank , a worry thought as armed drones fly in the skies above the @entity72 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 and @entity316			1
some 76 countries all told have drones , with many in the process of weaponizing them			1
@entity315 is supplying drones to @entity322 in @entity323 ; @entity324 is selling lethal drones to @entity326 ; @entity314 is selling drones all over @entity324 and @entity328			2
the global drones arms race , spurred on by the @entity72 , is in full cry .			1

@entity250 drones arms race , spurred by the @entity72 , is in full cry
in 2000 @entity212 had 50 drones - a decade later that had soared to 7,500
some 76 countries have drones , many in process of weaponizing them
