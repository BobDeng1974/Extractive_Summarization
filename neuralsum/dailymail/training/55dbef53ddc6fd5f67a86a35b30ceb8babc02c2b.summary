by @entity0 published : 09:52 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 10:23 est , 11 october 2013 earlier this year , jobless mother of 11 @entity2 caused outrage when it was revealed that she would be moving into a taxpayer - funded £ 500,000 home with her brood			1
but although the resulting furore cost her the house , @entity9 , who appears in new @entity12 documentary on benefits and @entity14 , is unrepentant			1
in the film , the foul - mouthed 37 - year - old from @entity16 is seen telling her friends that as far as angry taxpayers are concerned , her view is ' f * * * the lot of them			1
' unrepentant : @entity2 with one of her nine daughters at their taxpayer funded six - bedroom home outspoken : in the aftermath of the controversy , @entity9 appeared on @entity30 to defend herself ' it 's a f * * * ing s * * * * y council house , ' she adds			1
' everyone wants to believe what they read in the f * * * ing papers do n't they			0
' every child needs a house , a roof over their head i should say , do n't they ? it was n't our choice for the council to build a new house , it was theirs			2
' no one 's put a gun to their f * * * ing head			2
i think they [ other people ] are jealous			2
f * * * the lot of them ! everyone 's entitled to their opinion but everyone 's entitled to a place to live			2
' @entity9 , who receives benefits totalling £ 900 per week - the same as someone who earns £ 60,000 a year - is now looking forward to a council - funded renovation of her current home , which will see the two three - bedroom houses she currently occupies knocked together to create a permanent six - bedroom house			1
the cost of the renovation will run into thousands of pounds , and includes a new kitchen and bedrooms			0
but despite the vast expense to taxpayers , who spend a staggering £ 100 million on benefits every day according to @entity83 figures , @entity9 , who has never had a full time job , says the system is put there to help people like her			1
' yes , people do n't agree with the benefits system and s * * * like that but the benefits system is put there to help people that ca n't go out and work , ' she asserts			1
' yes , it 's my choice and my decision to have a large family but there 's no law out there to say how many kids you can have or ca n't have			2
there 's people out there with more kids than me , that 's my argument			1
' family affair : frost pictured with her 11 children including @entity116 , 19 , and @entity117 , 21 who also live on benefits home : @entity9 stands in the doorway of her current home which is to be totally remodelled at taxpayer 's expense she adds : ' @entity126 or someone who murdered someone would n't have got as much s * * * in the press as what i got			1
' you only get what you 're entitled to			0
you know , a weekly shop costs quite a bit , then gas and electric for both houses - it 's all got to come out of it			2
' by the end of the week , you can guarantee you 're skint			0
we ca n't afford to take the kids to @entity144 or on posh holidays			0
' as a result , in order to make ends meet , @entity9 says she is forced to enlist the help of local shoplifters who sell her purloined goods for half the price of what she would splash out legally in a shop			0
' everybody has to get stuff off shoplifters , do n't they , ' she says			0
' would n't have enough to live otherwise			0
renovation : this three - bedroom home and the one next door will be renovated for the @entity9 family lost : the £ 500,000 home described by @entity9 as ' just a s * * * y council house ' that she wo n't now be moving into ' i 'd be lost without my shoplifters because they bring all my washing powder			1
they do it for half the price of what the shop does			0
' when not entertaining shoplifters , @entity9 says she is looking forward to seeing what kind of response those who do eventually get the £ 500,000 home she almost moved into			1
' are the people who get it going to get as much grief as what i got ? ' she asks			0
' the £ 500,000 house was built for somebody			1
so lets see if they get the s * * * i got for being allocated it			0
' on benefits and @entity14 airs on monday 14th october at 9pm			0
