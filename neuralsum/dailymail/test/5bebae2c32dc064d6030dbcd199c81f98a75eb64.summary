after decades of snapping at the heels of rival @entity2 , @entity0 has overtaken the company on profits			1
and now the @entity7 giant appears to have come up with a foolproof plan for staying in the lead when it comes to womenswear			0
@entity13 's biggest fashion retailer has an impressive line in designer copies selling for a fraction of the price of the big labels			1
so if you love the @entity21 tote , but wince at the eye - watering price tag , you can pick up a looky - likey from @entity0			1
or if you fancy yourself in a @entity27 - style armband shift dress , but would n't remortgage your home to pay for it , the @entity0 version could be just the ticket			1
@entity0 's compact cut - out shoulder dress is a fraction of the price and it 's not just designer clothes that the company is expert at emulating			1
it also does its own versions of high - end homeware that wo n't break the bank			0
@entity45 , fashion and retail commentator , says one of @entity0 's greatest strengths is identifying catwalk trends that will appeal to its target market : mothers aged 30 and over and women starting out in their careers			2
' a perfect example is the @entity0 tan washed saddle bag , which is very like the @entity59 , ' says @entity45			0
' it 's a classic shape that 's also fashionable , a good combination for @entity0 customers looking for grown up - style			2
' what they do n't do , unlike shops appealing to younger women , such as @entity67 and @entity68 , is copy one - season wonders			0
' next customers are not looking for high fashion , but clothes to wear to an interview or at the office , and they have a much better line in these , including their designer copies , than @entity2			1
' the @entity78 jacket ( net - a - porter.com ) is lamb 's leather , while @entity0 's cropped @entity83 biker is made from viscose , polyester and cotton , hence the £ 700 price difference a @entity89 tote ( selfridges.com ) is made from top quality leather , but at a saving of £ 900 , @entity0 's polyurethane bag is a dead ringer it takes three to four months for designs on the catwalk to appear , in some shape or form , in @entity0			1
@entity67 and @entity68 - whose younger customers are eager to get their hands on high fashion - have an even quicker turnaround of three to four weeks			0
designer copycats have become a huge retail strategy in recent years , because while what appeared on the catwalk used to be kept under wraps until it arrived in the shops , now the runway attracts wide coverage , including online , and people expect to see versions on the @entity7			0
and these great lines in designer lookalikes go some way towards explaining how @entity0 reported a rise in annual profits of 12 per cent , to £ 695 million , last year and a further 12.5 per cent over the past 12 months , with profits totalling £ 782 million			1
the company is worth £ 11 billion , making it second only to @entity121 in the retail sector			0
that 's impressive in a market that includes ' pile - ' em - high , sell - ' em - cheap ' stores such as @entity126 and @entity127			0
but , says @entity45 , older shoppers will pay more for the better - quality stitching , buttons and linings at @entity0			2
as well as 500 stores in @entity13 and @entity133 , and 200 overseas , a substantial proportion of @entity0 's turnover comes from online and catalogue sales			0
@entity138 's medium @entity137 ( harrods.co.uk ) may have inspired @entity0 's much cheaper washed saddle bag besides its designer copies , shopping online at @entity0 provides almost instant gratification , as items ordered before 11pm are guaranteed for delivery the next day			1
combined with an easy returns service - items can be collected from your home by a courier - this means that if you fancy yourself in a @entity150 - style lace dress , but fear it may not flatter your thighs , you can try one on at home with minimal hassle , then get the chain to take it back if you 're not satisfied			0
last year , @entity0 began selling designer labels , including @entity158 and @entity159 , alongside its own brands , online and in the @entity0			2
and this innovation , says @entity45 , may have fuelled the company 's appetite for designer copies even further			2
' customers no doubt drool over a @entity167 dress or @entity169 blouse in the designer section , then spot something with the same sort of detail for a third of the price by @entity0 's own label and decide to give that a go , ' says @entity45			1
' the only note of caution i would sound is that next fabrics can be disappointing , as they use a lot of synthetics such as viscose and polyester - though this , of course , keeps the costs down			0
' @entity188 rossi double - band crocodile mules ( harrods.com ) the shoes above cost more than 50 times @entity0 's shiny golden versions , seen here the @entity193 copper pendant light at @entity0 ( r ) is less than half the price of the original @entity198 copper - plated hand - spun @entity196 pendant light from @entity199 ( liberty.com ) @entity0 's noir luxury fragranced candle ( r ) is a fifth of the price of @entity205 's oud & bergamot home candle ( jomalone.co.uk )			2
