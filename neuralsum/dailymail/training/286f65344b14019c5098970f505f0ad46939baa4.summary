thousands of favourite @entity1 garden plants and flowers could be banned from sale at garden centres under new @entity6 proposals			1
the popular lavender @entity8 , the highly scented iris @entity10 , the holly shrub known as @entity12 and the pink star - shaped clematis @entity14 are among those at risk			1
a @entity18 shake - up of plant legislation proposes that in future each plant variety must be given a detailed scientific description – as well as being listed on an official plant register			1
@entity24 lines the path of this home in @entity27 but the @entity1 does not have an official register of plants and experts say it would be too expensive and take years to set up			1
as a result , unregistered plants could be removed from sale in garden centres and other shops			1
the aim of the new legislation is to ensure consumers are not sold fake or inferior plants			2
but growers and gardening experts are incensed that what was intended as a simplification of trade rules could end up with a new @entity6 law that dictates what plants people are allowed to buy			1
anyone selling an unregistered plant could face hefty fines			2
the draft legislation is demanding such detailed information about each plant variety that experts believe descriptions would be two pages long and would even have to specify the lengths of hairs on stems			1
at present in the @entity1 , the nearest thing to an official register is a list of 52,000 varieties held by the @entity63 , the country ’s leading gardening charity			1
it is regarded as a plant ‘ bible ’ but only about 2,000 listed plants have an official botanical description			1
industry insiders say growers and plant breeders would also be deterred by the expected high costs of registering a plant			2
some breeders who wish to sell new varieties overseas already pay £ 400 to £ 500 to private consultants who write botanical descriptions			0
charges are higher for food seeds and plants and can cost up to £ 1,000			2
@entity83 holly is one of the plants more likely to be banned in @entity1 garden centres the @entity87 is urging environment secretary @entity88 to stop the @entity90 meddling			1
@entity91 , @entity87 policy manager , said : ‘ the @entity18 say it ’s not their intention to impose bureaucracy and cost on the industry , but the details leave it open to deliver exactly that outcome			0
’ @entity98 , who runs plants for @entity100 , an agent for plant breeders , said : ‘ everyone is really worried about this			1
we could lose lots of varieties			0
it is one of the most widely grown lavenders but it does not have an official recognisable description			1
growers might decide not to grow if they could not label it as @entity115			0
‘ @entity1 horticulture is all about developing unusual plants			1
we have a heritage of growing novel varieties			0
the whole trade is driven by varieties and people like to go and buy their favourites			0
we are all for consumer protection but this will harm consumers and reduce consumer choice			0
’ @entity130 , who runs just must perennials and has introduced hundreds of new @entity1 varieties , said : ‘ i have a business based on novelty			1
we ca n’t pay to register 100 plants a year , it will kill the business			2
’ one of the most popular daffodils in the country , a variety known as @entity139 , could also be affected			2
@entity140 ' @entity14 ' and @entity141 are among the unusual plants which the @entity87 feel should be grown more also at risk are the spiky scarlet flowered montbretia ( @entity144 ) , a tree mallow ( @entity146 ) , the lavender petalled cranesbill ( @entity149 ) , aromatic catmint ( @entity151 ) and the highly fragrant mock orange ( @entity153 )			2
@entity154 , supervisor of the garden shop at @entity156 in @entity157 , said they both sell and grow @entity8 and @entity149 in their gardens , first developed by poet and author @entity162 in the 1930s			0
both the 12th @entity164 in @entity165 and the @entity166 on the @entity167 grow the perfumed iris @entity10			0
@entity169 , @entity170 mep for the @entity171 , said : ‘ this is very poorly drafted legislation			0
@entity173 is famous for the diversity of our gardens			0
we either need to amend this completely or kick the entire proposal into the long grass – forever			0
’ a @entity181 spokeswoman said : ‘ we are working with other @entity6 countries to retain simpler rules which will allow companies to continue to sell ornamental plants and seeds without specific botanical descriptions			0
’ an @entity18 health and consumer policy spokesman said : ‘ there is nothing in the proposals that suggest we wish to ban anything			0
our aim is to make plant sales more transparent			0

popular @entity1 plants are at risk of being banned from sale at garden centres under new proposals
new plans require each plant to be given a scientific description and be listed on an official register
@entity1 experts say proposal would be ' too expensive and take years to set up '
