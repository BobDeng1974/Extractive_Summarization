by @entity0 published : 10:28 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 01:52 est , 19 july 2012 @entity2 's new socialist government is to pass a law making it illegal to arrest @entity6 - bound migrants flooding into @entity7			1
the proposed legislation comes after the country 's highest court ruled illegal immigrants can not be held in custody for having no identity papers			1
it is feared the new rules - due to become law in the autumn - will unleash a fresh tide of migrants on the northern @entity2 coast hoping to sneak on lorries and ferries to @entity6			1
@entity2 's new socialist government , led by president @entity23 ( left ) , is to pass a law making it illegal to arrest @entity6 - bound migrants flooding into @entity7			1
on monday , @entity27 mp @entity26 ( right ) cut a red ribbon to declare a refugee camp dubbed ' @entity31 ' open ' mini-sangatte ' : the wooden prefabricated huts currently have around 50 asylum seekers living in them president @entity23 's ruling left - wing party has also allowed the construction of ' refugee chalets ' close to @entity7 which have been dubbed a new ' @entity31 ' - the notorious channel migrant camp closed down ten years ago			2
the cluster of pre-fabricated buildings already have 50 migrants living in them , and sources in the @entity7 department have said more migrant chalets are set to be built			2
the latest ruling by the @entity48 earlier this month means their inhabitants are now free to make repeated attempts to sneak across the @entity51 without fear of arrest			0
originally a hangar for storing drilling equipment when the @entity58 was under construction , the @entity55 camp began sheltering refugees in 1999 and was open for three years			0
the centre was initially handed over to the @entity62 to offer shelter to people , mainly families , fleeing the @entity65			0
that population was supplanted by people fleeing @entity67 and subsequently @entity68			0
@entity71 claimed it stopped 18,500 refugees trying to smuggle themselves into @entity6 in the first half of 2002 alone , the vast majority of whom were from the camp			1
in 2002 then home secretary @entity75 and @entity2 interior minister @entity76 reached an agreement to shut it down			1
despite the closure of the centre at the end of 2002 , the problem remains , with refugees arriving in @entity55 every day			0
@entity2 's new interior minister @entity83 is keen to provide accommodation for the migrants in the area			1
after the election of the socialist government this spring work began on the new camp at @entity91			0
migrants can only be detained for up to six hours while police attempt to establish their identity			2
even if they are found to be in @entity2 illegally , the new law will state they can not held in secure detention centres but must be allowed to walk free			1
the law will affect around 1,000 illegal immigrants massed on the northern @entity2 coast , and up to 60,000 across the whole of @entity2			1
@entity2 interior minister @entity83 said : ' the decision handed down by the @entity48 forbids from now on placing people in custody on the sole motive that they are here illegally			1
' the prime minister has asked me to draw up a legal text as soon as possible to give this ruling a legal foundation			0
' the law would come before parliament in the autumn , a spokesman for mr @entity83 added			2
the announcement has been hailed as a ' victory for human rights ' by refugee groups in @entity2			2
@entity119 , spokeswoman for the @entity122 refugees ' association , said : ' until now , the police have been arresting and detaining immigrants on a massive scale			0
' after they are detained , most of these people are released anyway			0
we hope that this ruling will ensure that the police are respectful of immigrants ' basic rights and stop treating them like criminals			0
' since the bulldozing of the @entity55 camp in 2002 - which acted as a stepping stone for an estimated 50,000 migrants to reach britain - numbers of illegal immigrants in @entity7 have been gradually falling			1
the @entity142 centre which housed refugees at @entity55 , near the @entity2 terminal of the @entity58 was closed by @entity76 in 2002 waiting game : refugees line up inside the former @entity142 housing center at @entity55 in 2000 former president @entity76 ordered the destruction of a squalid woodland camp known as the @entity150 in 2009 and bussed almost 300 refugees out of the area			2
a year later , another 100 migrants were removed from a woodland encampment in the @entity156 town of @entity157			0
but it is now feared the socialist 's ' gentler ' approach to illegal immigration could see thousands more migrants flooding back to @entity7			1
a right - wing town councillor who asked not to be named said today : ' we spent a decade trying to clear up this problem that has blighted our town			0
' now with several strokes of the pen , the left - wingers in @entity168 and making it much more attractive for them all to return			0
