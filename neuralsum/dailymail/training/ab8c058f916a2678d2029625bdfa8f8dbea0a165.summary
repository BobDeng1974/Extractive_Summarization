@entity0 will attempt to lure @entity1 to @entity2 next season if the fly - half is left out of @entity7 ’s @entity6 squad in the new year			1
according to reports in @entity10 — the @entity2 publication often used as a mouthpiece by @entity0 owner @entity13 — the top 14 side want to bring in the @entity14 10 after missing out on @entity16 icon @entity15			1
@entity1 is out of contract in the summer and @entity18 understands that he could be tempted by a move to the south of @entity2 if he is overlooked at @entity7 ’s squad announcement next month			1
negotiations are ongoing with @entity14 , and the 27 - year - old has been in fine form for the high - flying @entity26 club , prompting calls for the playmaker to be given an international recall after missing out on the autumn test series			0
@entity2 top 14 side @entity0 are planning a raid to sign @entity33 fly - half @entity1 the player ’s agent , @entity34 , told @entity18 that no discussions have yet been held with @entity0 , contrary to reports that a visit to the club ’s facilities has already been agreed for early next year			1
‘ the rugby agents in @entity2 are more akin to football agents here , so i ’m sure there are a few touting his name around , ’ said @entity34			0
‘ as far as we ’re concerned , there has been no official contact with @entity0 and talks are advancing really well with @entity14			2
’ @entity1 is @entity14 ’s top earner on £ 250,000 per year , but @entity2 clubs have considerably more spending power			2
last week , @entity54 outbid @entity0 to sign @entity15 on an annual salary of more than £ 1million			2
@entity1 is out of contract in the summer and could fancy a move to the south of @entity2 if omitted by @entity7 the prospect of working under @entity60 would no doubt appeal to @entity1 , who would be viewed as a direct replacement for the out - of - contract @entity62 and @entity64			1
@entity1 ’s high - profile personality would be a perfect fit for @entity13 ’s galactico vision			0
the tycoon has already signed @entity16 midfielder @entity69 , saying that ‘ he ’s a great centre and he ’s got great looks			0
at @entity0 , we love this ’			0
harlequins , too , have been linked with a move for @entity1 , but the @entity77 club have already signed @entity79 @entity78 as a marquee player and @entity81 10 @entity82 still has one year remaining on his £ 320,000 contract			1
@entity54 outbid @entity0 in the race to sign @entity16 icon @entity15 no formal negotiation can be made until january 1 under @entity87 regulations , but overseas - based players can be approached , with @entity89 yesterday completing a deal for @entity93 scrum - half @entity91			2
but @entity94 were dealt a double blow as @entity97 targets @entity98 and @entity99 both extended their deals with the @entity101 and the @entity102			0
