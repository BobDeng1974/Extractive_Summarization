by @entity0 match conditions in @entity4 there could be thunderstorms , the temperature will be around 30 ° c and the humidity will be very high			1
the other concern is the grass			0
in @entity10 , it is thicker and longer which changes the speed of the ball			1
the side that dictates the tempo of the game can gain the upper hand			2
if you play a lot of short passes it can tire you out , so you need to be able to move the ball firmly , quickly and most importantly accurately			0
we know @entity24 and @entity25 have those qualities but @entity27 will be key			1
he can hit 40 to 50 - metre passes with accuracy and they could prove decisive if @entity30 capitalise on the pace they have up front			1
whoever gains the best control here can be the winner			2
hot and humid : @entity37 will be over 30 ° c in @entity4 , so whoever gains control of the game will be key shaping up : @entity27 can be that main man for @entity30 against @entity41 in the @entity43 clash how they shape up @entity30 have been looking at 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 and 4 - 3 - 3 , sometimes even shaping as a 4 - 4 - 2			1
the key components remain the same — @entity27 anchors the midfield , whoever is alongside him covers when he steps forward and they keep a fluidity in the movement of the front four			2
the problem is @entity41 are not easy to predict			1
they are really good at adapting themselves to suit their opponents ’ shape			0
they have looked most comfortable with a line of five in defence , as in with a midfielder sitting deep , yet they played 4 - 3 - 3 in the friendly against @entity62 and scored five			0
they have players who are attuned to different systems and tactically very good			0
@entity66 has kept the roots of @entity69 football in that they are strong in defence but they have such quality in front of them that they put greater emphasis on attack now than maybe previous @entity69 sides			0
@entity79 and @entity80 , who plays for me at @entity82 , were up front together in @entity41 ’s training session on wednesday and @entity84 returned from injury			2
that may give an indication of how a 4 - 3 - 3 may start against @entity30 with @entity88 supporting the attack			2
tactical nous : @entity41 have the ability to change their tactics to suit the game under @entity66 @entity95 stop @entity24 and you win the game			1
that ’s what you hear but i ’m afraid it ’s not that easy			0
in @entity41 teams go man to man on @entity24 when they play @entity104			1
yet @entity104 have other good players who can develop the game			0
even then @entity24 has such experience and intelligence that you normally see him , little by little , finding more space as the game goes on			1
@entity104 showed statistics this week that he has passed the ball 11,551 times in 11,344 minutes			0
@entity41 have @entity25 too who is able to move teams around			2
it helps if your forwards stifle the supply but @entity30 have enough quality to make @entity41 worry about them rather than all focus on @entity24			1
@entity27 can dominate , @entity121 is clever at finding pockets of space if he plays and the others in front must use intelligent movement			0
key player : if @entity30 stop @entity24 , they can win the game on saturday night set - pieces potentially , with two fairly equal sides , this could be the determining part of the game			1
@entity27 and @entity121 , two players i know well , have great accuracy and success rate whether with crosses or goals			0
the pace and delivery on a moist surface is absolutely key			0
@entity24 scored seven goals from free - kicks last season if you include his final one against @entity147 so is an obvious danger but @entity149 is very strong too			2
strong : @entity149 could be a danger from set - pieces should he feature and the pitch ? the images of the @entity4 pitch do n’t look good			1
the patches of sand , interspersed with the long grass , it means the ball will not run true and will bobble			0
the dryness slows the ball so it puts more emphasis on accuracy of pass and speed			0
does n't look good : quick passing will be key on a poor @entity4 pitch which is sure to see the ball bobble			1

control of the @entity43 game in the heat of @entity4 will be key
@entity41 are capable of *mixing* up their tactics to suit the opposition
if @entity30 stop @entity24 they could win their opener in @entity10
the pitch may be an issue , so the speed of the passing is key
