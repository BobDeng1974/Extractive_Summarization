@entity0 is currently discussing a ' strike ' which would black out @entity2 in protest against the @entity4 in @entity5 - a bill that critics allege would penalise sites such as @entity2 where users are free to publish what they want @entity2 co-founder @entity11 has threatened a ' strike ' where the entire english - language site would be turned off as a protest against an anti-piracy bill currently under discussion in the @entity5 the site is used by an estimated 365 million readers worldwide , and is ranked sixth overall on earth			1
writing on his private @entity2 blog , @entity0 said , ' a global strike of at least the @entity23 would put the maximum pressure on the @entity5 government			1
' at the same time , it 's of course a very very big deal to do something like this , it is unprecedented for @entity23			0
' the threatened ' strike ' - which would black out @entity2 in @entity32 and possibly other languages - is in response to the @entity4 , which is currently before the @entity35			1
opponents of the bill - designed to protect copyright online - allege that it takes a ' guilty until proven innocent approach '			2
sites such as @entity2 , where content can be published by any user , are alleged to be at risk			1
the activist group @entity45 said , ' at a minimum , this means that any service that hosts user generated content is going to be under enormous pressure to actively monitor and filter that content			1
' ' that ’s a huge burden , and worse for services that are just getting started – the @entity54 of tomorrow that are generating jobs today			0
' at present , mr @entity11 's proposed ' strike ' has been put up for discussion on the site			2
there are hundreds of comments from site insiders , most of which ' @entity59 ' the action			0
' this bill is a threat to the internet , and must be stopped , ' says one			0
in @entity70 , @entity2 took down almost the entire site in response to a law that would have made it a criminal offence to publish the results of police wire taps			1
the site threatened to make the blackout permanent			0
' a few months ago , the @entity80 @entity2 community made a decision to blank all of @entity82 for a short period in order to protest a law which would infringe on their editorial independence , ' wrote @entity0			1
' @entity88 backed down immediately			0
as @entity91 may or may not be aware , a much worse law going under the misleading title of @entity4 is working its way through @entity93 on a bit of a fast track			2
' i thought this would be a good time to take a quick reading of the community feeling on this issue			0
' ' my own view is that a community strike was very powerful and successful in @entity70 and could be even more powerful in this case			2
there are obviously many questions about whether the strike should be geotargetted - @entity5 - only , etc. ' one possible view is that because the law would seriously impact the functioning of @entity2 for everyone , a global strike of at least the @entity23 would put the maximum pressure on the @entity5 government			1
' at the same time , it 's of course a very very big deal to do something like this , it is unprecedented for @entity23			0
