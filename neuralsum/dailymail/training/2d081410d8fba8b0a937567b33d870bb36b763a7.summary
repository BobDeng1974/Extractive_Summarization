by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 published : 10:56 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 18:52 est , 3 march 2014 should @entity4 remain in charge of @entity6 ? the seriousness of @entity4 ’s headbutt was highlighted by the @entity9 when they declared that the offence was a ‘ non-standard ’ case for their disciplinary department			1
@entity4 has until 6pm on thursday to respond to being charged for his astonishing attack on @entity17 ’s @entity16			1
then , a three - man commission will be chosen to decide on a punishment that could extend to a lengthy stadium ban as well as a fine			0
@entity6 ’s manager is not expected to appeal			2
he has already apologised and said he will accept whatever punishment he receives			0
it is alleged that in the 72nd minute of the fixture , @entity4 was involved in an incident with a @entity17 player that amounted to improper conduct			1
due to the serious violent and / or aggressive nature of the reported behaviour this case has been designated as non-standard			0
@entity4 has until 6pm on thursday 6 march 2014 to respond to the charge			2
this means that the @entity9 will not need to call on an experienced and expensive qc to chair the commission			2
an @entity9 statement said : ‘ @entity6 manager @entity4 has been charged			1
it is alleged @entity4 was involved in an incident with a @entity17 player that amounted to improper conduct			1
‘ due to the serious violent and / or aggressive nature of the reported behaviour , this case has been designated as non-standard			0
’ @entity4 has already been fined £ 100,000 and issued with a formal warning by @entity6 , but his position could be reviewed by club owner @entity63 if the manager is hit with a stadium ban			1
@entity4 did at least discover that he had escaped criminal charges on monday			1
a @entity68 police chief said @entity4 ’s conduct could have been deemed ‘ offensive ’ , but added that no - one had requested that the matter be taken further			1
chief inspector @entity72 said : ‘ having reviewed the circumstances of the incident , it has been agreed that the matter will be dealt with by the @entity9 , rather than considering criminal proceedings			1
‘ there has been no complaint received from either the player involved or @entity17			0
@entity81 will not be taking any further action			0
’ we have been working with the @entity9 and the football club to progress the matter appropriately			2
having reviewed the circumstances of the incident it has been agreed that the matter will be dealt with by the @entity9 rather than considering any criminal proceedings			1
there has been no complaint received from the player involved or @entity17 at this time			0
whilst we appreciate that some people may have found the behaviour displayed at the game on saturday offensive , @entity81 will not be taking any further action			0
' it was only recently that the club dismissed reserve - team coach @entity100 amid allegations that he struck a player , understood to be 19 - year - old defender @entity103 , and the pressure could mount on the club to be just as tough			0
@entity9 chairman @entity106 has already described it as a ‘ serious ’ issue while leading figures in the game have said @entity4 ’s position is ‘ untenable ’			1
when the then @entity113 manager @entity112 was punished for physically confronting the fourth official in the tunnel at @entity116 earlier this season , he was hit with a five - game stadium ban			0
a 10 - game ban for @entity4 would see him miss the rest of the season with matchday duties switching to assistants @entity123 and @entity124 , leaving @entity6 owner @entity63 looking at the long - term repercussions			1
the controversial owner , who gave @entity4 an eight - year deal last season , is understood to have acted swiftly on saturday evening in an attempt to draw a line under the incident and end speculation that he intends to sack @entity133			1
but @entity63 holds a review of all aspects of the club at the end of every season and @entity4 ’s behaviour is certain to come under scrutiny despite him being almost certain to provide the top - half finish which was his target for this season			2
clash : @entity4 reacted in unprecedented fashion to being barged by the @entity144 international scuffle : the incident started after @entity16 pushed @entity4 out of the way with the ball rolling towards him off you go : @entity4 is sent to the stands by referee @entity151 from above : @entity4 ( centre ) looks on from the stands as @entity6 secured a 4 - 1 win opinionated : @entity155 , who managed @entity6 in 2009 , slammed @entity4 for his headbutt @entity6 are disappointed with the actions of its manager @entity4 this afternoon ( saturday , 1st march )			1
his behaviour was unacceptable and is not the behaviour we expect from the manager of @entity6			2
it is most disappointing that this incident has taken the focus away from what was a fantastic performance by the team and an excellent result away from home which leaves the club in eighth place in the @entity172			0
sadly , the headlines tomorrow will not be focused on the result or the efforts of the players , but instead on the actions of our manager			0
@entity4 unreservedly apologised immediately following the game to the player , to @entity17 and its fans , and to the fans of @entity6			1
we have held discussions this evening with @entity4 who has offered his sincere apologies to the @entity17 and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions			2
@entity4 has accepted a formal warning from the @entity17 in relation to his behaviour today and also a @entity17 fine of £ 100,000			1
@entity192 is now drawing a line under this matter and will be making no further comment			0
the @entity6 manager fined himself last month for a foul - mouthed attack on @entity199 manager @entity198			1
at the start of last season he pushed a linesman in the back and was involved in an ugly row with @entity206 boss @entity205 during the @entity207			0
on sunday even @entity208 , the chief executive of the @entity209 , could not defend @entity4			2
@entity208 was keen to stress that the second longest - serving manager in the @entity172 was ‘ extremely sorry ’ , but having spoken to @entity4 , he said : ‘ the buck stops with @entity4			2
it ’s unacceptable , it ’s inappropriate and it ’s insupportable from every perspective			0
not happy : @entity216 took issue with @entity4 's celebrations as @entity219 beat @entity220 1 - 0 in 2006 heated : @entity205 took exception to @entity4 's over-zealous celebrations in the 2011 @entity207 frankly , i was shocked and disgusted by @entity4 ’s incredibly irresponsible action			1
and yet , and even more disturbingly , i was n’t completely surprised			0
@entity4 has a lot of previous , a lengthy list of touchline bust - ups and misbehaviour			2
when manager of @entity230 , i had personal experience of @entity4 ’s touchline impropriety during a play - off semi-final with his then club @entity219			1
i was alarmed , to say the least , by the way he tried to influence the officials			0
he immediately realised the serious error , made sincere apologies to all parties			0
but @entity4 does need to think about how not to put himself in that position again			2
’ @entity4 has said he would have to ‘ sit down and stay out of the way ’ rather than roam his technical area			2
@entity208 nevertheless believes certain issues need to be addressed			0
@entity208 told @entity245 : ‘ we did a technical report last year			0
now we are working on a second report			0
i do n’t mention this now because of @entity4 but because it is an important project			2
' there can be too much traffic in the technical areas and sometimes problems arise because of that			0
' hot water : @entity4 called @entity199 boss @entity198 a ' f * * * * * * old c * * * ' in january best of pals : @entity260 , who has often found himself in trouble for acting out , came out in @entity4 's defence spitting feathers : @entity4 was banned for two matches after pushing a linesman against @entity266 in 2012 room with a view : the @entity6 boss was banished to the @entity270 stands after the push november 2006 : @entity4 had earlier in the year criticised @entity220 boss @entity216 for failing to field an @entity273 player in the @entity275 match against @entity276 and matters came to a head in @entity219 's 1 - 0 win over @entity220			1
then @entity219 boss @entity4 's enthusiastic celebrations appeared to irritate @entity216 , who claimed he was ' provoked in a disrespectful way ' , with the pair having to be kept apart by the fourth official			1
on this occasion , it was the @entity286 boss who was fined by the @entity9 , with @entity4 cleared of all charges			1
march 2012 : in a @entity207 , it perhaps comes as no surprise that the tension boiled over , with @entity4 , now @entity6 boss , clashing with @entity205 following his celebration to @entity294 's late equaliser in a heated match			1
both managers pledged afterwards to keep their emotions in check in future			0
august 2012 : @entity4 came under severe criticism and then afterwards labelled his behaviour ' ridiculous ' when he shoved linesman @entity303 in the @entity305 ' season opener against @entity266 after disagreeing with the official 's decision to award @entity266 a throw - in			0
@entity4 once again apologised for his actions but the @entity9 took a dim view and hit him with a two - match touchline ban and a £ 20,000 fine			1
january 2014 : @entity4 became involved in another touchline row , less than a month after having heated words with @entity316 boss @entity315 , with @entity199 manager @entity198			1
television cameras clearly showed the @entity6 boss launching an expletive - laden volley at the @entity321			1
@entity4 was spared punishment but said later : ' it was a heat of the moment thing , words we always have as managers , to a degree			0
i 've apologised and i 'm fortunate that he 's accepted that			0

@entity4 charged with improper conduct for butting @entity16
@entity334 boss escapes criminal action but will face ' non-standard ' @entity9 action
@entity6 could sack @entity4 if he is unable to manage in coming weeks
the former @entity219 boss was fined £ 100,000 after the incident
