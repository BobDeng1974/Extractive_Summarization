by @entity0 last updated at 2:43 pm on 2nd february 2012 just months after receiving a pair of carbon fibre legs , nine - year - old @entity1 has completed her first long - distance run			1
blighted by a tragic genetic condition - caused by her biological mother 's addiction to meth - she was born with badly formed limbs and aged 11 months underwent a double amputation			1
for years she learned to walk using prosthetic legs but at the end of last year she moved on to carbon fibre blades , similar to those used by high profile @entity17 athlete @entity16 , so she could participate in sporting events			1
just months after receiving a pair of carbon fibre blades , nine - year - old @entity1 completed her first run and after a few months of training and the support of her adoptive @entity24 from @entity26 , @entity27 , tackled her first mini marathon			1
although she had already been playing sports , the running blades will allow her to compete in track activities			0
all of the money raised from the mile sponsored run will go to help others like her			0
her foster mother @entity36 said : ' @entity1 is brilliant			2
she has a strong will and she ’s resilient and smart			0
' as a baby @entity1 was adopted by @entity36 and @entity39 who already looked after 23 other children			0
many of the other foster children also had disabilities caused by drug addicted parents so the couple were prepared for the type of care @entity1 would require			0
because her legs were so badly formed at 11 - months - old doctors amputated both of her legs above the knee			1
at the end of 2011 , nine - year - old @entity1 received her first pair of carbon fibre legs incredibly , after only a couple months of training , in january @entity1 decided to participate in a one - mile fun run a succession of prosthetic limbs allowed her to learn how to walk as she grew older			1
at the end of 2011 , aged nine she received her first pair of carbon fibre blades , which made it possible for her to run for the first time			1
incredibly , after only a couple months of training at a local gym , @entity1 decided to participate in a one - mile @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity27 this january			2
@entity36 added : ' a double amputee exerts 250 per cent more energy when walking than we do			0
' it took us nine years to get her healthy enough to wear these running legs			0
a little three or four - year - old ca n’t take in the 2100 calories needed to walk on artificial legs			1
' so @entity1 had to have a feeding tube inserted into her stomach to help beef her up			0
we just took it out in june 2011			0
after that she could have her running legs as she ’d built up enough muscle mass. ' @entity1 ’s contact with her biological family is almost non-existent - she has never met her mother , but has visited her brother twice			2
away from the running track @entity1 helps to run a charity called ‘ @entity1 ’ , which collects unwanted jeans and other clothing for disadvantaged children			2
