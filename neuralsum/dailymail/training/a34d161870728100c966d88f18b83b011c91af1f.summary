by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 23 october 2013 a @entity2 drug mule has been jailed for 10 years in @entity3 after the country 's @entity4 overturned an earlier acquittal			1
geologist @entity7 , 56 , claimed he did not know he was carrying 5.5lb of illegal stimulants - which have not been identified - in his luggage when he arrived at @entity11 's @entity10 after a flight from @entity13 , @entity14			2
the about - turn of the verdict has cast a spotlight on @entity3 's recently - reformed legal system			1
@entity7 's case was heard at @entity11 's @entity4 , pictured			1
judges agreed with a lower court ruling that he knowingly smuggled drugs into @entity3 lawyer 's first trial was heard under what is known as the new ' lay judge system ' in which a panel made up of members of the public take on the role of inquiring judges , guided by three professionals			1
the judges , hearing how the stimulants were allegedly found in @entity7 's luggage when he arrived at @entity10 in 2010 , found him not guilty , pointing out they could not be sure that he knew the package he was carrying contained drugs			2
prosecutors disagreed with the ' laymen 's ' verdict and took the case to the @entity42 , where @entity7 's acquittal was overturned			2
then the @entity4 confirmed the @entity42 's decision , judges agreeing that @entity7 was a knowing drug mule and had almost certainly received directions from his handlers			1
' a smuggling organisation usually gives a carrier instructions for how to return the luggage , regardless of whether or not it tells the person ' that its contents were contraband , said the judges in a ruling posted on the @entity4 's website			0
the ruling added : ' the defendant had no company for the trip and no reservations for accommodation as of his arrival in @entity3			0
@entity7 flew from @entity14 to @entity3 where he was arrested @entity7 was arrested after he got off a flight from @entity14 to @entity11 's @entity10 , pictured ' he also says he had no plans to meet anyone and no itinerary while in @entity3			1
' it would not be easy for a smuggling organisation to collect stimulant drugs from a person displaying such behaviour			0
' as well as being sentenced to 10 years imprisonment , @entity7 was fined five million yen ( about Â£ 30,000 )			2
the new law under which @entity7 was first acquitted was introduced in 2009 for certain serious convictions			0
before then , crimes were heard by a panel of professionals with no provision for trial by a jury made up of members of the public			0
the lay judge system has come under criticism for the powers that it holds			0
it is able to decide on both the verdict and sentence - and on one occasion in 2010 handed down the death penalty to a defendant who was a minor under local law .			0

@entity7 , 56 , has been through @entity3 's entire legal system from a laymen court to the @entity100 in @entity11
*initially* , the lay court decided he was *innocent* , but *subsequent* *appeals* ruled that @entity7 knew he was a drug mule who likely had directions from handler
he was sentenced to 10 years jail by the @entity4 in @entity11
case has put the spotlight on @entity3 's *judiciary* system and calls into *question* the role and powers of a court *presided* by members of the public
