conservation workers at the @entity8 on @entity9 , @entity3 , found the egg with its shell in pieces inside the nest of its mother , @entity14 , but the membrane underneath was still intact			0
after painstakingly repairing the shell , and a long wait , the @entity18 parrot chick beat the odds to enter the world			1
@entity23 : the @entity18 egg was found crushed in its mother 's nest , but only the shell had been broken , meaning the chick was still alive egg - streme care : staff at the @entity8 in @entity3 repaired the egg using clue and tape and placed it in an incubator hello world : the tiny @entity18 chick begins to hack its way out of the repaired egg the tiny chick has been named @entity39 , for now , until the sex has been determined			1
it is the first @entity18 to be born in @entity3 since 2011 , and brings the total population of the endangered bird species to 125			2
