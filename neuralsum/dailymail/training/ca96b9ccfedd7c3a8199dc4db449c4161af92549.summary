as @entity3 continues to lead a united @entity5 side up the @entity7 table , the boardroom battle at the club ’s owning company intensifies			1
a week after it was revealed imprisoned owner @entity8 is trying to oust three directors to appoint replacements of his choosing , including his common law partner and bodyguard , @entity15 ( @entity16 ) announced it believes a former employee may have misappropriated funds amounting to £ 2.5million			1
while these developments bear little immediate impact on the pitch – indeed @entity3 has been able to sign @entity23 to boost his squad – the escalation of disharmony in @entity27 could eventually prove deeply undermining			1
imprisoned @entity5 owner @entity8 plans to make changes to the @entity7 side 's board @entity8 is hoping to add his common law partner and bodyguard to the @entity5 board @entity5 owner @entity8 was jailed for six years in march 2014 for money laundering it is with this uncertainty swirling , that fans of any hue would be wise to keep track , and read haircuts and @entity43 : the @entity44 of @entity8			1
written by @entity46 , author of the well - informed @entity49 blog , and @entity50 , a lawyer based in @entity27 , the book provides context , fine detail , and measured story - telling to chart the story of @entity8 ’s life and involvement with @entity5			1
in an age when investors and shysters of different shapes and sizes converge on @entity63 football , the forensic attention given by @entity46 and @entity50 to the @entity8 story , from hairdresser to high - stakes gambler , is worth absorbing			2
a measure of the content can be found by the reaction drawn from @entity71 , @entity5 ’s one - time chief executive and long - term @entity8 confidant			1
in december he sent @entity75 messages that used physical intimidation and appeared to threaten legal action			0
more seriously for @entity5 , he alleged the club could be out of business by january over a £ 1.8m tax bill			2
@entity5 , led by director @entity81 , issued a statement firmly denying the claims , adding : ‘ all involved at the club are wholly unimpressed and saddened by the unprofessional and ludicrous actions taken which seem intent on discrediting and damaging individuals and the club			2
’ @entity5 manager @entity3 has helped his side climb the @entity7 table former @entity90 boss @entity3 took over the reins at @entity92 in october shares in @entity16 were suspended from trading , and @entity71 resigned as a club director			1
he lost his place on the @entity16 board too – but at the agm a fortnight ago he was re-elected , with @entity81 ousted , thanks mainly to votes cast by @entity8 from behind bars in @entity102			2
the next day , however , @entity81 – whose place at the helm of @entity5 had looked in doubt – was re-appointed with a deciding vote from @entity16 chairman @entity107			0
such boardroom battles have been frequent since @entity8 ’s arrest in june 2011 – and are much documented in haircuts and @entity43			0
in riposte the news followed that @entity8 , who remains the largest shareholder in company and club , wants to call an @entity117 at @entity16 and appoint three associates to the board			1
@entity23 has joined @entity5 on loan for the rest of the season @entity81 and his faction are eager that the credentials of the individuals satisfy @entity127 rules before an egm is held ; doing things by the book			1
in the same approach , the company reported the discovery of £ 2.5m misappropriated funds to police , concerned too that auditors had missed the loss			0
on tuesday afternoon , @entity46 reported on his @entity49 website that a 33 - year - old , believed to be @entity138 – a former compliance officer – has been arrested			0
events in the @entity140 may feel a long distance away , but they could bring trouble closer to @entity143 ’s as the @entity144 monitors @entity8 ’s influence			0
if the 54 - year - old continues to exert power at @entity16 and force through changes , the knock - on effect might be a shake - up in the @entity5 boardroom			0
from that stage , any suspicion @entity8 is able to act as a shadow director , against the governing body ’s rules given his money - laudering conviction , could lead to severe sanctions : transfer embargoes , point deductions , or , most damagingly , a ban from the @entity144 completely			0
that eventuality would be extreme and is far from probable			0
but choppy waters may lie ahead for @entity3 , who has steered a smooth ship against the odds so far .			0
