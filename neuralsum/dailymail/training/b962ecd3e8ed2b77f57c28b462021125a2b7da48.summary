the @entity16 in @entity17 as it appears in @entity6 's maps			1
the firm has come under fire for some of its @entity23 photography which has distorted buildings , and is set to face fresh competition from @entity0 's map app. it is believed @entity0 has been working on the app for months , as @entity6 revealed it was creating its own mapping service in june			1
maps are an extremely lucrative service for both firms due to revenue from advertisers keen to appear in searches			0
however , sources close to @entity0 have claimed the app , which is expected to be free , has recently been submitted to @entity6 for approval			2
this means it could be available within days			0
however , @entity0 faces one major hurdle - @entity6			2

no official statement has been made by either firm , but experts believe @entity6 holds the key			0
' maps generate huge amount of revenue , but the key is whether @entity6 will approve it - for instance , @entity0 's voice app has been delayed for over a year , ' said @entity58 of gadget website @entity59			1
' @entity6 could say it is too similar a product to its @entity52 service			0
' even @entity64 has turned on @entity6 's maps , with this sign being displayed at @entity68 station			1
@entity6 has already come under fire for its maps service , although the firm did today admit it needed improvement			0
' we are continuously improving it , and as @entity52 is a cloud - based solution , the more people use it , the better it will get , " said spokeswoman @entity73			0
' we appreciate all of the customer feedback and are working hard to make the customer experience even better , " added ms @entity73			0
