by @entity0 published : 02:41 est , 30 august 2013 @entity2 : 02:41 est , 30 august 2013 as the new @entity5 ’s refreshing informality continues to make waves — yesterday , he agreed to be part of a ' selfie ' photograph taken by a teenager inside @entity10 ’s in @entity11 — there has been an equally seismic change within @entity15 ’s leading catholic public school , @entity16			1
the £ 30,264 - a - year school — past pupils include @entity21 ( @entity20 ) @entity19 , @entity22 , the @entity23 and ex-rugby star @entity24 — has just announced that its headmaster , father @entity25 , will be retiring next year after ten years in the post			1
but in a huge break from tradition , the next head will not be a monk , as was automatic in the past			1
prestigious : the @entity15 's premier catholic school is to get a new head - but he wo n't be a monk alumnus : @entity22 is among the famous names to have attended @entity40 school indeed , ever since the school , in @entity42 , was founded in 1802 , there has always been a monk at the helm , drawn from the school ’s founding @entity45 , @entity40			1
at one stage , all the school masters were monks , having been specially trained at @entity40 ’s private @entity50 , @entity51			1
and there were no women teachers either			1
but over the past 20 or so years , and particularly since it became co-educational three years ago , there are many more women on the staff and now , of the school ’s 84 full - time staff , just five are monks			1
yesterday , a letter was sent out to the parents of the 600 pupils at the school informing them that father @entity25 , 57 , would be retiring , and announcing the ' significant ' change			1
the new lay headmaster will be appointed after september next year			1
' at this present time , the imperative to appoint the best possible head for the college compels us to seek a professional lay head , ' says the @entity73 , @entity74			1
' this conclusion has not been arrived at lightly , but , given both the nature and commitments of the monastic community and the needs of the school for the best possible leadership , we have decided upon this as the appropriate course of action			1
' a spokesman for the school tells me : ' it ’s a co-educational establishment , so the future head could just as easily be a headmistress			1
‘ we will simply be looking for the best catholic candidate we can find			1
’ as world leaders agonised over sending warships to @entity94 , @entity91 faced his own battle on the high seas			1
holidaymakers described seeing the portly prime minister attempting to haul himself onto a speedboat in @entity100 in @entity101			1
it happened on the last day of his family break before rushing back to take charge of the @entity94 crisis			1
one onlooker says : ' he was with his family and friends and security on the beach , when this speedboat roared up			1
he waded out to it and tried to clamber aboard			1
but despite a lot of huffing and puffing , he could n’t get in			1
it took him about five minutes before he finally managed it			1
' nerve - wracking : model @entity117 will appear on stage in @entity120 for the first time this week she dreams of being a @entity123 star , but when model @entity124 treads the boards in @entity120 for the first time this week , she admits it will be the most nerve - racking gig of her life			1
fortunately , she tells me , her younger sister , @entity130 , 22 , is on hand to keep her calm			2
' thank goodness for @entity130 , ’ says @entity124 , 26			2
' she ’s flown over from @entity135 not only to see me perform — but also to help out backstage			2
' in @entity136 , @entity124 plays a 19th - century @entity138 woman who has an affair with a dashing army officer			2
it opens at the @entity142 at @entity143			2
' there ’s no full - time stage crew , so @entity130 and i have been painting the stage and helping with the scenery , ' says @entity124 , muse of @entity138 multi-millionaire @entity150 for whom she has modelled at his stately home , @entity152			2
' what with endless rehearsals , some days i ’ve been in the theatre until midnight			2
' @entity130 is good at dances such as waltzes , which feature in the play , and she has taught me how to do them , too , while staying with me in @entity160			2
' she loves @entity161 so much i think she might even join me here eventually , but she does n’t want to be an actress , she wants to do something sensible — like being on a news channel			2
' nose job : @entity166 had to wear a prosthetic nose to play princess @entity168 in an upcoming film @entity123 actress @entity166 has admitted to painstakingly researching princess @entity168 ’s accent and mannerisms for her forthcoming biopic — but what of her decision to wear a fake nose ? while some fans of the princess may not approve , petite @entity166 , 44 , says she had to remove the middle of her eyebrows so the proboscis would fit			2
' we had a prosthetic nose made because mine is very different to @entity168 ’s			2
she had a strong nose that was pointy			2
' if you put a point on the end of my nose , it looks like i ’m wearing a nose that ’s too big for me , ' @entity184 - nominated @entity166 says			0
' so we just went for the bridge of the nose and shaved my eyebrows in the centre to make room for it			0
' perhaps she sought @entity168 ’s permission from beyond the grave			0
prince @entity200 has already revealed that his son , @entity201 , is ' a bit of a rascal ' , and now he has a playmate			0
@entity200 ’s @entity206 prep school chum , commodity broker @entity207 , is celebrating the birth of @entity209 with his wife , @entity210 , daughter of @entity211 , a scion of the @entity213 biscuit family			0
says a friend : ' @entity209 was born in @entity215 , where @entity207 and @entity216 live now			0
both mother and baby are doing really well			0
' the couple wed two years ago at @entity210 ’s father ’s grand country pile , @entity222 , in @entity223			1

. these are heady days for @entity225 , son of @entity227 gold medallist and showjumping star @entity228			0
yesterday , @entity225 made his debut as a trainer when his horse @entity232 ran at @entity233			0
and , i can reveal , @entity225 , 28 , and his wife @entity235 , 24 , a solicitor who runs her husband ’s new office , are expecting their first baby			0
' i ca n’t wait			0
the baby is due on october 21 and we do n’t know if it ’s a boy or a girl , ' @entity225 tells me			0
' @entity235 is getting to the stage where it ’s a concerted effort for her to do anything			0
but we ’re very lucky to have such wonderful support			0
' indeed , his new venture is a family affair : @entity228 helped set up the stables and @entity225 ’s younger brother , @entity253 , 24 , who won the @entity254 in 2009 , is stable jockey			0
@entity256 was responsible for one of the most enduring royal scoops of modern times — prince @entity262 ’s ' slitty eyes ' remark to a group of students during the @entity266 ’s 1986 visit to @entity267			0
nonetheless , the residents of @entity269 will be saddened to learn of the death of veteran royal writer @entity271 at the age of 70			0
for the distinguished @entity274 journalist and author covered the highs as well as the lows of royal history with equal flair			0
yet throughout it all , he eschewed sensation			0
when the @entity266 ’s press secretary was first informed of the ' slitty eyes ' gaffe , he implored @entity271 not to write about it			0
' surely the @entity274 , of all people , are not going to use this ? ' he begged			0
' most certainly , ' @entity271 replied , ' but not until paragraph 14			0
