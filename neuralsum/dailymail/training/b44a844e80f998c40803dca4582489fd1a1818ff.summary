by @entity0 published : 10:51 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 10:54 est , 31 october 2012 the former @entity3 director who resigned after being widely criticized for the government ’s slow response to @entity6 has now spoken out against president @entity7 for acting so quickly to @entity8			1
‘ one thing ( president @entity7 ’s ) gon na be asked is , why did he jump on ( @entity8 ) so quickly and go back to @entity13 so quickly when ( after ) @entity14 , he went to @entity15 ? why was this so quick ? ... at some point , somebody 's going to ask that question , ’ @entity9 told @entity10			1

while the hypocrisy of @entity9 questioning @entity7 ’s speed in response to a hurricane is absurd , it is not the first time that the @entity7 administration ’s awkward reaction to the terrorist attacks in @entity14 , @entity67 , last month has been in the spotlight			2
many pundits speculated that the presidential campaign may take priority in the aftermath of the hurricane , as he did not cancel a campaign event in the swing state of @entity77 until the last very minute			0
he did eventually cancel the event and has since scheduled a tour of some of @entity36 ’s most devastated areas with the state ’s governor			0
governor @entity85 , an outspoken @entity86 and supporter of @entity7 ’s presidential rival @entity88 , has lavished praise on the president over the past two days			0
