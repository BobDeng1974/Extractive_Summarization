sitting outside his mud - brick home in the tiny village of @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 holds a crumpled picture in which he cradles his newborn son , @entity9			1
@entity6 explains that @entity9 was a playful toddler , and used to like playing outside the house with his ball and listening to the radio			1
but in december last year , the two - year - old got sick			0
the toddler came down with a sky - high fever , began vomiting , and passing black stools			0
at the time , @entity6 had no idea what was wrong , but experts now believe that @entity9 was @entity21 ' patient zero ' - the first person to contract the virus , starting the current outbreak			1
the virus also killed @entity6 's wife ( right ) @entity6 said his son used to play ball outside his house , and liked listening to the radio ( right )			1
@entity6 also lost his daughter and mother - in - law to the disease , which killed 14 in his village it took @entity9 just four days to die , passing away on december 6			1
his sister , @entity43 , fell sick on @entity44 and was dead before @entity45			2
their mother followed , along with their grandmother			2
@entity6 told @entity50 : ' before my children @entity9 and @entity43 died , they loved to play with a ball			1
my wife liked to carry the baby on her back			1
' now all he has to remember his loved ones by are a few crumpled photographs			0
nobody knows how exactly @entity9 caught the deadly virus , though it is likely that he somehow came into contact with the dead body of an infected animal - a fruit bat , chimpanzee or porcupine			2
@entity69 , the head of the @entity70 , has appealed for 5,000 more doctors to help fight @entity21 in @entity72			1
speaking in @entity73 , mr @entity69 said the spread of the disease was outstripping international efforts to stop it			2
he said he was ' worried ' about where the extra medical staff would come from , and suggested travel bans would help contain the virus			0
the village of @entity83 sits in @entity85 province , along the borders with both @entity87 and @entity88 , where the disease now runs rampant			1
medics studying how @entity21 first spread believe two mourners were infected at the grandmother 's funeral			2
somehow the village midwife also became infected , and before she died on february 2 , gave the virus to one of her relatives			2
it was n't until march that the mystery sickness was recognised as @entity21 and , by that time , dozens of people had died in eight communities in @entity5 and suspected cases were emerging in @entity88 and @entity87			1
nearly a year on from the death of @entity106 , more than 5,000 people have died as far afield as @entity107 in the midst of the worst @entity21 outbreak in history			1
@entity6 's village is now free of @entity21 , but his family has been torn apart by the illness			1
@entity106 is listed as the first to die in his village from a then - unknown disease - which experts now believe was the first case in the current @entity21 outbreak the virus has since left @entity6 's village , with no confirmed cases since april , but his family life is in tatters - and all he has to remember them by are crumpled pictures @entity6 is now facing financial hardship , as his tiny community - which survived almost exclusively by selling crops to neighbouring communities - has been shunned worse still , the impoverished community has been ostracized by the rest of @entity5			1
its main source of income was selling bananas and rice to nearby villages , but they no longer want to trade			0
villagers fearful of catching the deadly virus also burned their clothes and mattresses , but now can not replace them			0
elsewhere , in @entity87 , medical workers have been shunned by their own families as they struggle to treat the sick in makeshift treatment centers			0
the workers say they have been left with nowhere to go as landlords evict them as soon as they discover where they are working			2
added to that misery , the medics have not been paid for the last two weeks as the government struggles to keep up with the spread of the virus			0
by the time the illness had been identified as @entity21 and treatment centres set up in @entity85 province , where @entity6 and his family live , it had already spread to @entity87 and @entity88 @entity158 and his daughter stand next to the shallow grave where his wife was buried after dying from @entity21 in february this year across @entity5 children have been orphaned after their parents died from @entity21 ( pictured )			1
while tradition means they would have been adopted by neighbours , fears over the virus have left them on the streets unsurprisingly , medical staff make up a significant proportion of fatalities , with an estimated 57 per cent of medics working with @entity21 patients eventually succumbing to the disease , according to the @entity175			1
in total , say the most recent reports , 377 health workers across @entity72 have succumbed to the virus , with 216 now dead			0
today the head of the @entity70 @entity69 appealed for more medical staff to travel to @entity72 to help fight the infection , saying the disease is outstripping efforts to stop it			0
speaking on a visit to @entity73 , mr @entity69 said at least 5,000 more staff were needed to bring the situation under control			0
@entity189 has become the sixth @entity191 country to report a case of @entity21 after a toddler died last week			2
more than 80 people who had contact with the boy are now being monitored , according to @entity175			0
@entity197 and @entity198 had also reported cases of the disease , but managed to stop it from spreading after tracking down all possible victims and monitoring them , a feat medics hope to repeat in @entity189			0
from @entity205 's village , the disease spread to @entity87 and @entity88 ( pictured ) where it has infected more than 10,000 people and killed 5,000 medical staff in the madly - affected @entity191 nations are struggling to deal with the outbreak , with 57 per cent of all health workers who come into contact with @entity21 eventually succumbing to it fear and misunderstanding over the killer disease has lead many to shun those trying to treat the illness , who are often thrown out by their own families ( pictured , a sign warning about @entity21 is seen in @entity5 ) meanwhile , in @entity107 , the disease has also wrong - footed authorities , who have been thrown into apparent chaos over how to treat those who are returning from fighting the disease in @entity72			1
the chief of the @entity231 , @entity233 governor @entity232 , and @entity235 gov. @entity234 , have all said those returning from crisis - hit areas will be confined to their homes for 21 days			0
the move came after it was revealed dr @entity242 , who is currently being treated in @entity235 for the virus , roamed freely around the city for six days before he was diagnosed			0
even in developed nations , such as the @entity107 , authorities have struggled to respond to the disease			0
nurse @entity248 ( pictured ) was quarantined in a hospital car park this weekend after returning from treating the illness in @entity72 , despite testing negative for the virus			0

@entity106 , two , is named as ' patient zero ' of current @entity21 outbreak
father @entity6 tells of how disease also killed his daughter and wife
recalls playful children and proud mother who carried them on her back
@entity21 killed 14 people in his village and has since left 5,000 dead *worldwide*
