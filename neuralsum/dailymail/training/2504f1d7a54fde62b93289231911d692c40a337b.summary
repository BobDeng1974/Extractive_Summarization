by @entity1 reporter published : 11:06 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 13:59 est , 4 january 2013 shaking hands when meeting someone new or giving a high five to a friend are things most people take for granted			2
but for 29 - year - old double hand transplant patient , @entity9 , being able to do these simple acts means the world			1
the @entity13 fashion graduate lost both hands and feet five years ago , when a blockage in her small intestine resulting from @entity17 led to an infection that turned her extremities into dead tissue			1
she knew things were bad , but had n't processed quite how bad			0
' there was a period of time where they did n't tell me that they had to amputate , but somebody from the staff said , " oh honey , you know what they are going to do to your hands , right ? " that 's when i knew , ' she said			1
without her hands and feet , @entity48 had to adapt			1
she learned how to brush her teeth , do her make up and drink from a cup using just her arms , which were amputated just below the elbow			2
she even taught herself how to text on her cellphone without fingers			0
@entity48 got fitted with prosthetic legs and accepted that getting new feet was probably an unrealistic goal			2
but living the rest of her life without hands was n't an option , particularly as she complained that her prosthetic arms were too heavy , having been designed for men			2
' i 've accepted the fact that my feet are gone , that 's acceptable to me , ' she said			1
' my hands ( are ) not			2
in my dreams i always have my hands			2
' donor : nearly 18 months ago , @entity71 , pictured in hospital , got the call that a donor had been found that would give her hands and forearms again adjusting : the skin color of her new hands and arms is n't exactly the same as her upper arms and the fact they still looked like they belonged to someone else was hard for @entity71 , pictured , to accept at first for the next couple of years , @entity71 exercised diligently - something she needed to do to qualify for a hand transplant			1
she also had to wait for a donor , preferably a woman who had similar sized hands and skin color to her			1
the waiting was the hardest part , she told @entity31			0
' i hate thinking about that , ' she said			0
' i think that whoever 's hands will be with purpose , not just used to look pretty			1
' the surgery took nearly 12 hours , as two separate teams of doctors , one dedicated to the left hand , the other to the right , worked to perform an operation that surgeons have only attempted about 60 times in the past 15 years			1
@entity48 woke from the surgery in a cocoon of bandages			2
@entity118 told @entity31 that the initial signs that the donor 's hands would take were good			1
' this is more than we could ever hope for , ' he said			0
' her blood pressure is good , all the parameters related to how to blood flow in and out of her new arms			0
this is , if you will , a picture perfect course so far			0
' before : @entity48 , pictured , suffered a major sepsis infection following intestinal surgery because of @entity17 's disease , which required doctors to amputate her arms below the elbows and her legs below her knees no hands : without her hands , @entity48 had to adapt , learning how to drink from a cup , brush her teeth and apply makeup , pictured , with her arms @entity48 was out of the @entity147 and working on a therapy regime less than a month after surgery			1
the skin color of her new hands and arms was n't exactly the same as her upper arms and the fact they still looked like they belonged to someone else was hard for @entity71 to accept			1
' the first couple of days i refused to look at them , ' she said			0
' it was kind of like one of those scary movie moments			0
i 'm too scared to look because it 's reality ( but ) i 'm so grateful to have them that i just do n't really think about it superficially			2
' four months after her surgery , in january 2012 , @entity48 continued to amaze doctors with her recovery			1
she was n't expected to have fine motion control for another year or 18 months , but her muscles were reacting well and she could even pick up small objects with her new hands			1
even so , there was still a huge concern the transplant would n't take			0
surgery : the cutting - edge surgery , pictured , took two teams of doctors 12 hours to complete ' in @entity9 's case , the hookup of the new hand is relying on her nerves growing into the new muscles from the donor , ' @entity118 told @entity30			1
' the nerves have to grow into those muscles , takes months , it can take a year ... failure means the part that does n't survive and we have to re-amputate the transplant			1
' but @entity118 does n't think that will happen for @entity71			1
he says her prognosis for both hands could n't be better			0
@entity48 , who was always one of the pretty girls , says the whole experience has taught her a lesson about what 's important in life			0
' people used to turn and look at me when i walked down the street because of how beautiful i was , ' she told @entity31			0
' now they turn and look at me because i 'm in a wheelchair			0
' the type of person that i was would be the type of person i would hate now			0
i used to care way too much about what i looked like			0
what does it matter what my hair looks like ? what does it matter what i 'm wearing so much ? ' she added to @entity226 : ' i can sense the donor			0
i have a great sense of appreciation			0
