@entity5 , 42 , suffered the injury as she played with son @entity7 while on holiday in @entity9			1
she noticed something was awry the next day when applying suncream to the area and it felt sore			2
lucky diagnosis : @entity5 , 42 , was hit in the chest with a ball as she played with her son @entity7 while on holiday in @entity9			1
when the area was still sore a few days later , she saw a doctor who detected a lump worried , she saw a doctor as soon as she returned home to @entity22			1
she said : ' when i went to the doctor , there was a little lump there - but i was told it would n't be anything serious			2
' but tests and a biopsy later revealed that she had aggressive stage three cancer , which can be life - threatening			1
mrs @entity5 said : ' i just feel so lucky that @entity7 hit me in the chest with the ball , or i would n't have noticed [ the lump ]			1
i did n't feel ill and was n't in any pain			0
' she added that @entity7 , 15 , had been worried he had caused the cancer			2
mrs @entity5 said : ' at first he thought that he had caused it , so we had to reassure him			2
he was shocked and upset but we told him that he had found it for me			0
he saved my life , definitely ' the mother - of - two said : ' at first he thought that he had caused it , so we had to reassure him			0

' @entity47 says that physical injury of a breast is unlikely to result in cancer			1
instead , because the area is sore or injured , the breast itself is being examined and followed more closely than usual , and that is why breast cancer is detected , rather than it being due to the actual injury			1
after 15 sessions of radiotherapy , she has been told the cancer is no longer present - and is now fundraising for cancer charities mrs @entity5 's treatment began in september 2010 with six rounds of chemotherapy at the @entity65 in @entity22 , which specialises in cancer treatments			2
she then underwent surgery to have the lump from her breast and the surrounding lymph nodes removed			2
in april 2011 , after 15 sessions of radiotherapy , she was told the cancer was no longer present - and says she is healthy again despite having weaker muscles			0
despite this , she ran a @entity75 this summer			0
just five years before , she had run the same race in aid of a colleague who lost a battle with cancer			0
mrs @entity5 said : ' it felt strange doing it again after my cancer , but it was a great experience and i raised Â£ 282			2
' she added that living through breast cancer had been a terrifying experience , but that her husband @entity87 and two children @entity7 and @entity89 , 23 , were very supportive			1
she said : ' when it was confirmed i had cancer , i was just so frightened			0
but i was determined to beat it and i just kept positive			0
' i was also really lucky to have such fantastic friends and family who supported me throughout			0
' generally , doctors do n't believe that an injury to the breast can lead to cancer , according to @entity47			1
an injury can cause fibrous scar tissue to form and this may be mistaken for cancer			0
or inflammation may make a breast lump that is already there more obvious			0
some women wonder if a past injury could have caused their breast cancer			1
one study by scientists at the @entity111 found that physical trauma ( a blow to the breast area ) could cause breast cancer			1
however , other experts contest that because of trauma to the breast , the breast itself is being examined and followed more closely than usual , and that is why breast cancer is detected , rather than it being due to the actual injury			1
experts add that cancers are fundamentally caused by faulty or damaged genes and take a very long time to develop , and it 's much more likely that injuries draw attention to tumours that are already there .			0

@entity5 was playing ball with son @entity7 , 15 , in @entity9
went to see her doctor once she was home because the area was still sore
tests revealed a lump and aggressive stage three breast cancer
physical injury can lead to a diagnosis of breast cancer because women *inspect* the sore area more closely , says @entity47
