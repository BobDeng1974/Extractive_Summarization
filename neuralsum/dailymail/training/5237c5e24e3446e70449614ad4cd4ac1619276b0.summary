by @entity0 published : 04:54 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 11:03 est , 6 march 2013 run - down and left to the elements , these abandoned buildings offer a sometimes macabre , often poignant insight into their history - as a leper colony			1
the centuries - old institution on the @entity9 island of @entity10 once housed dozens of outcasts who had contracted the disease , which is still often misunderstood today			1
these evocative photos by @entity14 vividly reveal the environment in which the lepers were forced to live out their lives			2
@entity9 leper colonies are the subject of @entity35 's best - seling debut novel @entity34 leprosy , also known as @entity38 's disease after physician @entity38 , is a chronic disease caused by the bacteria @entity40 and @entity42			1
left untreated , the disease can cause permanent damage to the skin , nerves , limbs and eyes			0
a common myth is that body parts can fall off , but it can cause limbs to become numb or diseased from secondary infections			0
although the form of transmission remains uncertain , it is thought to be through respiratory droplets			0
the @entity57 estimated that in 1995 between two and three million people were permanently disabled because of leprosy			0
in the past 20 years , 15 million people have been cured of leprosy worldwide			0
the colony , called @entity63 , opened in 1378 as the first leper colony in @entity65 and one of the first in all of @entity68			1
it was intended to isolate those suffering from leprosy and other contagious skin diseases from the rest of society in order to avoid infecting others			0
the origins of leprosy , now known to be caused by a bacterium , were then unknown , adding to the stigma placed on its sufferers			0
as the disease was so poorly understood , many of the ' lepers ' sent to the colony did not even suffer from it - rather , they had other skin diseases or fungal infections			1
such was the fear and stigma , settlements were usually built in isolated locations such as islands			0
sometimes , however , they were deliberately set up to be accessible so that they were kept in the public eye , and thus received a steady flow of donations			0
@entity99 was no such colony			2
fitting with the commonly held belief of the time that the disease was a punishment from @entity106 , there was a church dedicated to @entity108 , the patron saint of lepers			0
step inside : the abandoned leper colony is now a tourist attraction since being shut down in 1957 picturesque : some of the photographs make you forget the sinister past of the buildings eerie : other images bring home the horror of what used to happen at the institution outdated : lepers were made to live with one another and forbidden from mixing with their families it is just one of the run - down buildings on the colony photographed by @entity14 , where children â€™s notebooks and medicines lie scattered alongside open tombs			1
doors are smashed , stripped beds lie rusting , and rotting floorboards give an ominous creak whenever someone is foolhardy enough to put their weight on them			0
while it would of course have been miserable to be separated from one 's family and placed in a colony , these pictures show that there were positives to be found in life at the colony			2
ancient : the colony opened in 1378 as one of the first homes for lepers in the whole of @entity68 beautiful : photographer @entity14 managed to transform the creepy colony into these stunning images decline : the 19th century brought warfare and natural disasters to @entity10 sign : a @entity9 poster advertising ' the leper colony of @entity10 ' to would - be visitors some areas of the complex are undeniably beautiful , and it could have been a consolation to spend time with fellow sufferers who could empathise with each others ' plight			1
the colony at @entity10 began to decline during the 19th century , when the island was the centre of fierce fighting in the @entity176			1
by the middle of the century @entity10 was largely deserted , and the situation was worsened by an 1881 earthquake which killed nearly 8,000 people			1
the colony was finally shut down for good in 1957 , by which time a cure had been found for leprosy and much of the stigma had disappeared in the @entity185			2
however , there are still hundreds of leper colonies open around the world , particularly in @entity189			2
storeroom : old furniture from the colony stacked up in a room since it closed down mystery : the cause of leprosy was unknown until it was discovered to be a bacterium in the late 19th century stigma : many believed that the illness was a curse from @entity106 due to references to it in the @entity204 relic : but hundreds of leper colonies are still operating around the world , particularly in @entity189 back in time : the building has been left just as it was and is now a valuable historical exhibit @entity211 : but some leprosy sufferers may have been able to enjoy a reasonable quality of life			1
