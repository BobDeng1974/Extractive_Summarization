by @entity0 a shadowy @entity2 based company has applied to trade mark the word ' @entity4 ' in what could be a sick attempt to profit from the tragic @entity8 disaster			1
a business called @entity10 lodged an application with the @entity12 on july 18 , just hours after 298 people were killed when their plane was shot out of the sky by a missile above eastern @entity17			1
amongst the passengers on the doomed flight were 37 @entity21 citizens and residents			2
the application on the @entity12 website , seen by @entity25 , shows that it is currently being examined by officials			2
sick : a mysterious @entity2 based company applied to trademark the word ' @entity4 ' within 24 hours of the disaster happening the company has applied for a @entity32 trade mark which includes entertainment , educational and cultural services which would cover film production , exhibition , curatorial and gallery services and live performances			1
a person who owns a trade mark in @entity21 may be able to stop other people using the same or a similar trade mark in the country			1
this means , for example , if someone wants to make a documentary about @entity48 they may not be able to use the word ' @entity4 ' or may have to pay the company for the right to use it			1
the mysterious business is registered to an address in an apartment block in @entity55 but they also have a post office box at the @entity58 on @entity60 's @entity59			2
offices ? the shadowy business is registered to an address in an apartment block in @entity55 ( pictured ) the people behind the company are not named , they do not have a website and no contact details are available for them			1
a spokesperson for the @entity12 , @entity71 , told @entity25 : ' the trade marks will be examined in due course '			1
' prior to that examination we are unable to say whether it will be accepted or not			0
however , there is provision within the @entity78 to object to marks which are considered " scandalous " , they fall under @entity83 ( a ) of the @entity78 , ' they said			0
it typically takes approximately 4 - 8 weeks for a trade mark to be examined			1
' if it were to be accepted for registration , any interested third party can oppose its acceptance			2
if a trade mark is registered it means that the registered owner of the mark has proprietary rights to use as a trade mark for the goods and or / services claimed , this does necessarily preclude others from using or referring to the term outside the parameters of the trade mark , ' the spokesperson added			1
cashing in ? as families of the 298 people killed on flight @entity48 grieve around the world , the company is trying to trademark the flight 's name devastated : @entity110 and friends attend a multi-faith service at @entity113 in @entity114 on thursday for those who lost their lives on @entity8 flight @entity48 asked whether they often received applications for trade marks based around disaster events , they explained ' it is not a common occurrence for these types of marks to be filed , but it can occur '			1
a @entity8 spokesperson told @entity25 that they are trying to block the application by also applying to trade mark the name			1
' @entity8 has started the process of filing the trademark over " @entity48 "			1
the purpose is to ensure no party takes advantage of the tragedy for their personal gains , ' they said			1
sadly this is not the first trade mark application for the word ' @entity48 '			1
a @entity142 based company named incorporated @entity143 has applied to the @entity145 and @entity146 website to trademark ' @entity48 ' in @entity148 , @entity140 reports			1
a corporate lawyer told the website that the most obvious reason why one would want to register ' @entity48 ' is probably due to the potential of movies or books being made around the event			1
' however , one should also question whether they infringe the rights owned by @entity8 in applying to register such a mark in the first place			1
' usually , the registrar would not allow registration should it feel that this infringes the existing rights of another party			2
@entity8 still retains the common law proprietary rights in the mark , ' she said			1
devastation : the crash site of the downed @entity8 flight @entity48 , in a field near the village of @entity174 , in the @entity176 region of @entity17 tragic : this photo shows a @entity2 expert checking the debris at the main crash site of the @entity182 flight a trade mark registration initially lasts 10 years from the date the application is filed			1
it can also be renewed indefinitely by paying renewal fees			0
earlier this week it was revealed the names and photos of @entity21 @entity48 plane crash victims are being exploited by online scammers who have set up fake @entity195 tribute pages to drive traffic to a dodgy external website			2
the @entity195 pages , created on the day the plane crashed , baited people to click on another website with a link purporting to show footage of the @entity48 disaster			2
' @entity206 caught the moment plane @entity208 over @entity209 here the video of @entity208 , ' the link read			0
the scam also exploited the names of victims from other countries , including @entity233 from the @entity234 , @entity236 - born @entity235 , @entity8 pilot @entity237 and @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 from the @entity236			2
@entity195 has taken down the pages but the external site @entity243 remains live			0
it was registered in @entity244 , @entity245 in 2010 and the @entity247 address tracks back to the @entity248			0
@entity249 , chairman of the @entity21 chapter of the @entity251 , said it looked like the website had been hacked in order to divert to adult hook up websites and others selling counterfeit drugs			0
online fraud experts said the pages were in poor taste but would only be forcibly removed by @entity195 if they were criminal ' i 've seen this quite a lot , hackers get in , take control of a site and they then divert to a stack of stuff and use the bandwidth of this guy 's website sometimes for illegal purpose sometimes or for getting the hits up on certain sites , ' mr @entity249 said			0
he added that the websites that goalshighlights.com diverted to contained malicious files that would infect a user 's computer if clicked on			0
@entity225 mother - of - two @entity224 was one of the victims targeted by the scam mr @entity249 added that fraudsters often capitalised on disasters like the @entity48 crash			2
' when a disaster like this happens it 's a great opportunity for all sorts of scammers , ' mr @entity249 told @entity25			1
' everybody is out there looking for information at the moment , everyone wants to know more about what 's happened			0
' it 's a great opportunity to prey on people 's vulnerabilities and emotion is the greatest one			0
' scammers aim to lure a portion of the high amount of internet traffic going to websites with @entity48 information , mr @entity249 said			2
' some people will be using it for an opportunity to market their sites , it 's a good way to bring a massive amount of traffic to someone 's site , ' he said			0
' other offenders will be doing this for more sinister purposes			0
' before the @entity195 pages were removed users expressed outrage , labelling them ' disgusting ' and the person who created them a ' sicko '			0
others reported the pages to @entity195 as spam in the hope of getting them taken down			0
but some @entity195 users did not realise the pages were fake , posting heartfelt messages to the page			0
' @entity332 , terrible ... to lose your kids in this way ... such beautiful lovely children ... no words ... ' one person wrote on the page of @entity223			0
' we pray for all the @entity21 people , especially the children god will take care of them in his safe hands let the stars shine bright for u so u know that ur not alone , ' another person posted			0
a spokesman for @entity195 said : ' we are disabling these profiles as soon as we are made aware of them			0
' we encourage people to block those responsible and report suspicious behaviour to our team of experts via our reporting buttons so that we can quickly take the appropriate action			0
