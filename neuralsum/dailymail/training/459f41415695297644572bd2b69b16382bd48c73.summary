@entity1 and @entity2 authorities tested a new facial recognition software that secretly scanned every person who attended two major music festivals in @entity2 - all without their knowledge or consent , according to a @entity2 newspaper			1
the massive surveillance system , run by the company 's @entity10 , aimed cameras on thousands of people at @entity14 , a massive concert series near @entity16 , in may and september 2013			1
the first test run took place a month after bombings that killed three people and injured dozens more near the finish line of the @entity22			0
according to the newspaper @entity24 , @entity2 police officers were on hand to witness the test of the surveillance system - though @entity1 staffers were running the operation			1
these images , purportedly taken from an @entity1 report on surveillance operations at the @entity14 music festival , show how people were scanned at the event dig @entity24 reports that the program scanned to determine ' skin tone , ' ' head color ' and clothing texture of attendees , with the goal of running everyone at the event through the software the example of surveillance camera footage shows how the @entity1 software was able to flag all black women wearing glasses and yellow shirts who went through mass transit turnstiles			1
it is not clear whether this was part of the @entity14 surveillance activity dig @entity24 claims that the test sought to track ' every person ' at the musical festival with ten surveillance cameras that had been set up around the event			1
the newspaper says it uncovered documents detailing the use of @entity1 's @entity64 software , which identifies ' baldness , ' ' head color , ' ' skin tone ' and clothing			1
