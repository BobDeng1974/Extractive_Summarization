follow @entity1 's coverage of the @entity3 round of 32 as @entity6 host @entity4 at @entity7 and @entity10 host @entity8 at @entity11 on thursday night			1
both know a place in the @entity14 is up for grabs for the winner of the competition and will look to steal a spot among @entity19 's elite next year			0
so , can @entity6 and @entity10 see off their @entity21 opposition ? both kick - off at 8.05pm			1
host commentator that 's all for tonight , thanks for joining			0
who says the @entity3 is boring ? what a game			0
@entity10 pushed relentlessly in the second half and thoroughly deserve their draw			1
two substitutes combine with @entity31 heading the ball onto @entity33 in the box , who controls it on his chest before firing into the roof of the net			1
a disappointing result in the end for @entity42 who should have been out of sight after the first half			1
there will be three added minutes in @entity47 and four in @entity48			1
having been so dominant in the first half , get a distinct impression that @entity6 will settle for the draw here			1
@entity4 have been poor on the whole tonight but one man out there has rolled back the years tonight - @entity54			1
this is the best i 've seen him play in years and has been a constant threat on the counter attack			0
@entity59 walks slowly off the pitch to be replaced by @entity61			0
the unimpressive @entity62 is replaced by @entity63			0
@entity64 comes on for @entity65 , who appears to be injured			0
@entity66 ' miss when through on goal			0
it 's hard to see the hosts getting a better chance to equalise			0
unless he 's exhausted it 's hard to see the logic in bringing off @entity74			0
by wide consensus he 's been @entity42 's best player			1
@entity77 makes a change as @entity79 is replaced by @entity80			0
@entity81 is replaced by @entity82 as @entity4 look to secure the result			1
scorer of @entity10 's first goal @entity86 is replaced by @entity31 while @entity33 comes on for @entity87			1
birthday boy @entity88 is replaced by @entity89			0
club - record signing @entity90 replaces @entity74 - the @entity92 winger started really well but has drifted out of the game slightly			2
the view from the stands at @entity11			0
the @entity96 has had little - to - no service all game but he counters well , finding space in the box before lifting his shot just over the bar			2
his best chance of the match so far ( not that that 's saying much ... ) and @entity107 really should have scored			2
the former @entity109 striker misses a glorious chance when through on goal			0
good save by @entity112 , though			0
@entity113 is replaced by @entity114			0
@entity4 captain @entity115 is replaced by former @entity117 man @entity116			1
@entity6 's leading scorer is getting ready to come on ... had doubts over whether @entity6 could maintain their early pace and that is proving the case			1
they have slowed up dramatically in the past 10 minutes			0
@entity124 with a decent chance for @entity10			1
the former @entity127 man gets away from @entity8 's defence but his run pushes him wide and his shot is saved well by @entity112			1
@entity77 and @entity131 watching their teams during the second half @entity135 's got a long way to go to make up for his howler but he 's trying			0
@entity139 dances into the box and bends one towards the top corner but @entity10 's keeper palms it away at full stretch			1
the longer this game continues with the scores level the more @entity147 will have to think about bringing @entity114 off the bench - a 1 - 1 draw would not be a satisfactory result for @entity42 , especially considering their domination in this game			1
both teams back out and play is underway in @entity48			1
... and we 're back under way at @entity7			0
at half - time we are listening to @entity159 and the @entity160 , who have produced @entity6 's official @entity162 final song			1
it is a re-working of @entity164 's @entity6			1
half time at @entity11 and @entity8 lead 3 - 2			1
fans , and @entity135 , may feel it 's a harsh scoreline but every mistake is punished at this level and @entity10 know that			1
half time in @entity47 but @entity172 really should have restored their lead before the break			0
@entity176 's header is saved and the ball falls for the @entity178 to tap into an empty net ... but he somehow conspires to hit the bar			1
calamitous football from @entity135 ! a long ball is played into the @entity10 box but the goalkeeper fumbles what should be a routine catch and @entity187 pounces to restore @entity8 's lead			1
even when he scores , it 's never quite straightforward for @entity176			1
@entity192 free - kick to concede			2
the free - kick is whipped in after @entity176 's foul			1
@entity195 palms it away but @entity197 is on hand to bury the rebound from close range			1
@entity176 is beaten by compatriot @entity201 but as the winger heads towards the box the @entity6 striker brings him down			1
@entity114 on the bench but getting plenty of love from the crowd			0
' @entity114 , give us a wave ' followed by said wave has got the biggest since the goal			0
other chants have included : ' @entity214 , we are coming for you			0
' at 2 - 0 down @entity10 looked in danger of being humiliated at @entity11 but in just over 60 seconds they have come roaring back into this tie			1
@entity218 looking very ordinary here			0
@entity86 involved again , a speculative cross comes into the box @entity10 's previous goalscorer pressures @entity222 , who puts it into his own net from five yards out			1
@entity86 grabs a vital goal after a nice move for @entity10 and @entity131 's side are back in this			1
@entity228 forward @entity187 doubling @entity8 's lead in the first half			1
@entity176 gives @entity6 the lead with a superbly - taken volley			1
@entity233 , on loan from @entity235 , celebrates gibing @entity8 the lead in the fourth minute			2
@entity218 misses a glorious chance to equalise			0
the ball bobbles through to him as he makes his way into the box but takes an age to shoot and is closed down well			0
@entity187 makes it 2 - 0 to the visitors			1
@entity131 's side struggled to clear the ball and the @entity228 strikes from close range with his shot slipping under @entity135			0
@entity4 are firmly on the back foot against @entity6 , they look rattled by that early goal and ca n't string two passes together			1
@entity8 , on the other hand , look as confident as they have all season			2
@entity10 need to wake up			2
@entity254 with the first booking of the night in north @entity47			0
that did n't take long			0
@entity113 wasted a great chance moments earlier but what a lovely finish from @entity176 for 1 - 0			1
gets maligned quite fairly for his finishing but that was impressive			0
@entity176 grabs his fifth goal of the season and what a goal it is			2
@entity42 swing in a corner and the former @entity267 man drifts away from his marker and volleys home			2
@entity8 lead ! @entity139 takes a pass over his shoulder and volleys beautifully			1
it 's saved initially bit the loan player is quick to react and tucks away the rebound			0
@entity124 wastes no time in proving he 's up for the occasion			0
@entity10 press high up and the january signing takes a shot from just outside the box			2
the keeper saves low just to his left			0
referees in @entity47 and @entity48 blow their whistles to start the games ! celtic legend @entity286 was on the pitch before kick - off giving them an emotional speech - i think it 's fair to say the passion is still there for him ... check out @entity1 's pre-match stats and facts video not long to go until kick - off now , the players have finished their warm up and are back in their dressing rooms			1
richards impressed in his last outing for @entity4 - a 3 - 1 win over @entity305 - but again fails to make the starting lineup			1
the full back is now almost certain to return to the @entity308 in the summer , although former @entity309 boss @entity77 has expressed an interest in bringing him to @entity8			1
despite a hero 's welcome at @entity8 , it has n't been easy for @entity77 in @entity21 this season			2
his side are currently 10th in @entity316 and have lost three of their last five matches			0
one positive note for them , though , is that they won their previous two matches , scoring seven goals and conceding just one in the process			0
after just one goal in his first 16 games for the @entity330 this season , @entity59 has now netted five in his last four appearances			2
he 's still a long way off his @entity235 form , but the @entity96 forward will be a huge test for @entity336 and @entity337			0
the @entity316 side may be without @entity339 but @entity218 , on loan from @entity341 , does get the nod			0
@entity343 : @entity344 , @entity254 , @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 , @entity54 , @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity115 , @entity59 , @entity218			0
subs : @entity116 , @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity82 , @entity61 , @entity353 ( gk ) , @entity354			0
after a difficult start to life at @entity10 , manager @entity131 is finding his stride			2
tonight , though , is surely his largest test - and it will be played out in front of his largest crowd			2
the full 60,000 capacity is expected to be filled for the match against @entity77 's side			2
@entity364 left @entity365 in search of game time but after failing to score a single goal for @entity8 he does n't make the squad for the match tonight at @entity11			2
@entity343 : @entity112 ; @entity222 , @entity370 , @entity371 , @entity372 ; @entity373 , @entity374 , @entity79 ; @entity139 ; @entity375 , @entity88			2
subs : @entity377 , @entity89 , @entity378 , @entity379 , @entity80 , @entity380 , @entity381			0
there 's no place for on - loan @entity309 striker @entity33 in @entity131 's lineup , @entity107 is preferred again			1
@entity343 : @entity135 ; @entity65 , @entity386 , @entity387 , @entity388 ; @entity389 , @entity390 ; @entity124 , @entity391 , @entity86 ; @entity107			2
subs : subs : @entity394 , @entity64 , @entity31 , @entity395 , @entity396 , @entity397 , @entity33			2
and the big news is that star striker @entity114 ( 23 goals this season ) is rested , leaving @entity176 ( four goals this season ) to lead the line			2
@entity343 : @entity195 ( c ) , @entity403 , @entity336 , @entity337 , @entity404 ; @entity405 , @entity62 ; @entity172 , @entity406 , @entity407 ; @entity176			2
subs : @entity409 , @entity410 , @entity411 , @entity412 , @entity90 , @entity63 , @entity114			0
it 's a @entity3 double - header tonight with @entity6 hosting @entity4 and @entity8 travelling to face @entity10			1
