if @entity2 students have the same inflated influence on presidential politics that they 've traditionally enjoyed , @entity0 has some long days ahead in @entity5			1
of a randomly selected group of 50 students who said they followed presidential politics enough to comment , just nine told @entity9 that the former secretary of state would make a good @entity12 chief executive			1
@entity0 's detractors were far more passionate than her fans – a potential problem since she needs a repeat of her grassroots - driven upset 2008 victory here in order to solidify her status as the @entity22 ' standard - bearer			1
@entity23 , a government major from @entity24 who leans @entity25 , said a president @entity0 is ' just going to continue a lot of things @entity28 has been doing			1
' ' there has n't been much good in @entity28 's foreign policy , ' @entity29 added			1
she called @entity33 ' grizzled ' from a life in politics and said that ' just because she 's a woman does n't mean she should be president			1
many of them , like freshman @entity59 , were n't old enough to drive when it happened			0
' i think there was blood on her hands , ' @entity59 told @entity9 , referring to @entity33 's handling of an @entity69 terror group 's military - style assault that laid waste to a @entity72 facility			1
he said he believes @entity33 's performance before , during and after should disqualify her from holding higher office			1
' i definitely do , ' he said			0
' it shows how she acts under pressure			0
' like most of his classmates , @entity59 was born during @entity33 's second term as president			1
@entity82 is carefully cultivating his generation 's progressives and moderates , emphasizing her grandmotherly listening skills while papering over her liabilities			0
@entity59 said he knows why @entity33 is n't emphasizing her eight years as a presidential spouse			1
' it almost seems like she tried to use the position of first lady to nudge her way into possessing political power , ' he mused , dropping hints about her ' @entity99 ' medical insurance overhaul proposal			0
' but i was n't too old at the time			2
' @entity5 election law allows college students to choose whether to register to vote at home or at school			1
many of the students @entity9 spoek with said they had n't decided yet ; but all of those wh ohad made up their mind said they would vote in the @entity5			1
political crossroads : @entity110 , @entity5 is a frequent presidential primary debate site , hosting @entity22 in 2007 and @entity25 ( pictured ) in 2011 most of the students who said they would vote for @entity0 said they have little knowledge of her history before she led the @entity72			1
' i do n't know that much about her political baggage , ' conceded @entity121 , @entity123 native @entity122 , 19			1
but she insisted that @entity33 would make a strong candidate because of her support for liberal positions on social issues			2
' i think it 's ridiculous that we have n't progressed to the point in society where things like gay marriage are n't still questioned , ' @entity122 said			2
other left - leaning students were lukewarm or directly hostile to @entity33			2
@entity2 government student @entity23 said of @entity33 that ' just because she 's a woman does n't mean she should be president ' @entity136 of @entity137 , @entity138 , a budding economist , would say only that ' she definitely is one of the more qualified @entity22 for the position			1
' @entity141 , a @entity143 , @entity142 native , told @entity9 that ' she does n't look like that fantastic a candidate			0
' @entity141 has few quibbles about @entity28 's foreign policy – ' it was probably more positive than negative , ' he said – but is n't reassured by the idea of one of his secretaries of state taking over the @entity152			1
' it seems like she wants the job more than she would be good at it , ' said @entity141			0
@entity2 , the only @entity158 school in an early presidential primary state , is picture - postcard - beautiful but also isolated			1
@entity110 , @entity5 is 80 miles away from the nearest commercial airport and more than a two - hour drive from @entity163			2
so political discussions happen in a vacuum			0
' we 're in a bubble here , ' one student nearing graduation told @entity9 during a sunday full of interviews in dining halls , academic study lounges and dorm rooms			2
the entire @entity5 is in some ways a closed information ecosystem , built half of @entity163 exurbs and half of towns best described as small , smaller and smallest			2
@entity181 , the state 's biggest city , has a population that barely ticks above 100,000			2
fully 70 per cent of @entity5 towns are home to fewer than 5,000			2
but the first - in - the - nation primary state 's voters wield enormous influence every four years , and @entity2 is their intellectual center of gravity			1
@entity33 is visiting @entity5 on monday and tuesday for the first time since she launched her presidential campaign online a week ago			1
a lifetime ago : @entity0 was first lady from 1993 to 2001 , years when today 's @entity2 undergraduates were born @entity195 : @entity2 sits in a town of 11,000 and remains both the northernmost and the smallest of the eight famed @entity158 universities her organization 's first seven days afloat were an experiment in rebranding a four - decades political veteran as a grinning grandma tuned in to the concerns of average voters			1
it 's a farcical ploy that just might work , according to @entity207 , a @entity2 economics major from @entity208 , @entity209			2
' her life has always been in the spotlight , ' said @entity213			0
' i think that 's why it 's really interesting that she tried to go with this " everyday @entity12 " campaign			2
' ' everybody knows that her life has not necessarily been about the everyday @entity12			0
' @entity213 said if @entity33 is the @entity22 ' nominee , she would more likely than not vote for her anyway			0
' any attempt at trying to reach out to the everyday citizen is always going to be a good thing ... whether it 's just for show or if it 's actually genuine , ' @entity213 said			0
a young woman seated next to her in a campus cafeteria listened intently and summed up the philosophy : ' fake it ' til you make it			0
' answers to two questions about @entity33 seem to unite @entity2 students : neither her age nor her sex matters much to today 's collegiate elites			1
@entity33 would be the second - oldest @entity12 president , and ' people are going to bring up her age , but that does n't really matter , ' said @entity243 , a @entity22 - leaning upperclassman from @entity244 , @entity245 who voted for president @entity28 in 2012			1
one - @entity246 : ' everybody knows that her life has not necessarily been about the everyday @entity12 , ' @entity2 student @entity207 said of @entity33 ' age is not a huge factor for me , ' added government student @entity252 of @entity253 , @entity254			1
' and i hope gender is a non-factor			0
i think it should be a non-factor			0
' @entity259 , a history major from @entity260 , said , ' it may be a historic thing , but it should n't matter			1
i do n't really care what the gender of the person is			0
it 's whether their ideas are good			0
' that 's the problem , @entity259 added			0
' she obviously has a lot of experience in a lot of ways , but what might keep her from winning is what she did with that experience , ' he said			0
' under @entity28 i really think we 've made a lot of mistakes ' with foreign policy , he explained , ' and some [ were ] under her tenure			1
' ' i do n't know what she would do to change things			0
i think that 's for her to clear up			0
' it 's early in the 2016 race , and for every student who talked with @entity9 another two said they would n't start paying close attention until the fall			2
in october 2011 @entity2 hosted a memorable @entity25 primary debate that included now - forgotten names like @entity297 and @entity298			2
four years earlier it was the @entity22 that took over @entity110 for a day , back when @entity28 was just finding his voice			0
@entity260 native @entity259 , pictured with unofficial @entity2 mascot ' @entity300 , ' said electing the first female president ' may be a historic thing , but it should n't matter			1
i do n't really care what the gender of the person is ' but sometimes lightning in @entity5 can strike early			1
it was in may 1987 – almost as early in the cycle as today 's candidates find themselves – when sen. @entity312 's campaign imploded during a press conference in the @entity314 , just steps from the @entity2 green			1
the pothole in his road to the @entity49 was an affair with model @entity320			0
their trysting spot : a boat named ' @entity325			0
' there 's not a single @entity2 undergraduate today who was alive then			2
' most of the things i know about her were during her time as secretary of state , ' said @entity252 , a government major from @entity253 , @entity254			0
' i do n't know much about what she did as a senator , or before that			0
' ' it 's hard for me to think of any particular accomplishments , ' @entity336 told @entity9			0
' i suppose – i know she visited the most countries of any secretary of state			0
' ' but when you see a bunch of messes abroad , you kind of think of who was – well , it falls under who was secretary of state at the time			0

@entity2 is the only @entity158 school in an early primary state , giving he school enormous influence and a recurring role hosting primary debates
random sampling of 50 students found just nine who said @entity0 would make a good president
seven of those nine said they knew little about her political baggage
age and gender do n't matter to *millennial* academic elites , but they 're concerned about @entity33 extending @entity28 's foreign policy
@entity33 will visit @entity5 on monday and tuesday for the first time since her campaign launch a week ago
