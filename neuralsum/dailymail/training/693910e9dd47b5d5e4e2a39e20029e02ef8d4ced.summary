my close friend 's summer wedding was in @entity3 , the prettiest village in the @entity4 , according to the most influential designer of the 19th century @entity6			0
not only was i to be an usher but i was also fortunate enough to be staying in the @entity4 's first and only residential nature reserve , better known as @entity9			1
while my friends lugged their wedding outfits and bags into their hastily - arranged @entity13 , i was picking up the keys to @entity15 - a timber - clad four - bed , four - bathroom detached retreat set within the 550 - acres of this gated , luxury second home development in the @entity19			1
the rear balcony of @entity15 , a four - bed , four - bathroom timber - clad lakeside home in the @entity19 established in the early 1990s by the late @entity23 , the one - time champion waterskier , pilot and entrepreneur , with the aim of providing sustainable living alongside wildlife , it now attracts wealthy professionals and celebrities looking to get away from the hustle and bustle			2
@entity23 sadly passed away last year aged just 53 and left his family to continue his legacy - a challenge they have clearly accepted with pride and gusto			2
as my friends unpacked and looked around their respective hotels , i took one of the estate 's brand new mountain bikes out for a ride across the reserve and over to the on - site shop to stock up of eggs , bacon , wine and bread			1
the spa 's outdoor pool , even in september , was heaven - heated and surrounded by comfortable sun loungers @entity9 sits at the heart of the @entity19 - one of @entity55 ’s most diverse , attractive and appealing areas			1
it has a rich heritage of country houses , wildlife parks , nature reserves and gardens and it ’s dotted with idyllic villages and historic towns such as @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			0
the regency pleasures of @entity69 and the @entity71 glories of @entity72 are less than twenty miles south west of the estate			0
from the shop i cycled over to the spa that comes complete with indoor and outdoor heated pools , a technogym , sauna , steam rooms , and @entity81 's first lily - filtered outdoor eco-pool			1
there 's also a lounge in which to relax and treatment rooms with over 60 therapies from which to choose			0
beyond the spa are eight lakes and two rivers that provide the perfect opportunity for boating and fishing			2
for those looking to get close to nature , the woodlands and hedgerows are home to numerous species of plants , including several varieties of orchid , with three bird hides providing the ideal spot for quiet contemplation of the native wildlife			2
the view from the rear balcony			0
so nice to wake to the sound of birdsong and the fresh breeze from the lake @entity9 offers three nights in a two - bedroom luxury apartment ( sleeping up to 4 ) , from £ 453 on a self - catering basis and including spa access it is approximately one hour 45 minutes from @entity116			1
it sits surrounded by acres of lakes , woods and meadows there is a well - equipped on site shop			1
guests can rent bikes , canoes and paddle boards i could n't believe that only two hours before i was loading my car in @entity116			1
i knew it was only a matter of time before my friends showed up wanting to look around and i was only too ready to show it off			0
by the time they arrived i was perched out on the back terrace , having lit the bbq and opened the giant glass doors to both front and back balconies			0
the one thing that struck all of them while navigating their way around the lakes to @entity15 was just how unique each and every house is on the estate			0
all are individually designed with prices for three nights in a two - bedroom luxury apartment ( sleeping up to 4 ) starting from £ 453 , on a self - catering basis , including spa access			1
on the day of the wedding we woke to blue sky , balcony doors wide open and a beautiful breeze ripping off the back lake			0
all of the @entity9 homes are spacious , airy and naturally well lit thanks to these gigantic windows my friends gather in the huge , fully - equipped kitchen , for a few pre-wedding beverages the boys loaded a car with the usher suits and headed over to the groom ’s hotel room above the village pub in nearby @entity167 , just outside @entity67			1
one ushers lunch later and we were off to @entity170 for the wedding and party			0
as the bride and groom , @entity174 and @entity175 , made their vows , and we stood watching , a butterfly fluttered in and out of the pews and remained for most of the service			0
a poignant moment that seemed to capture the specialness of the day			0
dinner and the speeches passed , as they too often do , like a blur as conversation whirred and drinks flowed before i headed back in a taxi to @entity192 @entity9 estate sits in the midst of acres of woods and meadows - it 's restful and peaceful to the extreme bride and groom , @entity175 and @entity174 , on their special day ( left ) and the ushers ( right ) , excuse the brown shoes the beautiful people ! i forgot how much fun it is to be in a swimming pool with good friends the bride and groom joined us all the following day for the perfect post-wedding catch - up			1
we rode the bikes to the spa and spent the late afternoon swimming in the outdoor heated pool before heading back for a barbecue on the front terrace			1
we ate outside as the sun went down and toasted the amazing weekend and the beautiful surroundings that made it the perfect wedding			0
what you want from a mini-break is a sense of discontinuity - to leave and feel you 've ticked the boxes and made the most of your few days			2
you get that at @entity192 the luxury of the homes and the resort itself make it hard to leave , even for the beauty of the @entity19			2
but that 's no bad thing			0
three nights at @entity15 on @entity9 cost from £ 1050			1
