by @entity0 former @entity2 crime boss @entity1 is appealing the federal conviction that sent him to prison for life last year , arguing that he was unable to fully present his defense			1
@entity1 , who 's 84 , was convicted and sentenced on racketeering charges that tied him to 11 murders and other gangland crimes from the 1970s and ' 80s			1
in an appeal filed thursday in the 1st @entity16 @entity15 , @entity1 's lawyers @entity12 and @entity13 argue he was ' deprived ' of a critical defense in his trial : that a now - dead federal prosecutor had given him immunity from his crimes			1
@entity1 's case ultimately became a black eye for the @entity31 and the basis for recent @entity45 movies after it was revealed that corrupt federal agents had accepted bribes and protected him over the years			1
but , during the trial last year , judge @entity48 ruled @entity1 could n't raise the immunity claim because he offered no hard evidence to support it			1
the judge also said prosecutor @entity52 , who died in 2009 , did n't have authority to grant such immunity			1
this ' constitutional error ' affected the fairness of @entity1 's trial and must result in reversal , his lawyers wrote in their appeal			2
immortalized : @entity1 ( left ) and the corrupt @entity31 agents who protected him are the subject of an upcoming film , @entity62 , starring @entity63 ( right ) ' if mr. @entity1 had been permitted to testify about his immunity defense in his own words , then the jury would have the opportunity to weigh his credibility with that of the government 's witnesses , ' they wrote			1
' ... his testimony alone could have made a difference in the verdict			0
' @entity1 's lawyers also argue they had been prevented from showing how the government 's plea deals with three key witnesses — a gangster , a hit man and a @entity1 protege — ' deeply inspired ' the former associates to blame their boss for ' any and all crimes , regardless of the truth			2
' @entity1 's lawyers hone in on hit man @entity87 , who admitted killing 20 people but served only 12 years in prison in exchange for testifying against @entity1			0
@entity1 's lawyers say they should have been allowed to explore allegations @entity87 had been committing new crimes since his release from prison			2
prosecutors have said the allegations had been investigated and found untrue			0
@entity1 fled @entity2 shortly before his 1995 indictment after being tipped off by a former @entity31 agent			0
he was one of the @entity31 's most wanted fugitives for 16 years until his 2011 arrest in @entity101 , @entity102			0
following a 35 - day trial , a federal jury last august found @entity1 guilty of 31 of 32 counts , including racketeering , money laundering , extortion and firearms violations			0
the jury also found prosecutors had proved @entity1 participated in 11 of the 19 murders of which he was accused			0
@entity1 was sentenced in november 2013 .			0
