published : 09:41 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 09:42 est , 24 january 2013 @entity1 's feared morality police say they will not punish men who walk around in their underwear - but women still face harsh punishments if they violate strict laws on women 's dress codes			1
the @entity9 has denied reports of a ban to counter the controversial trend of young men frequenting shopping malls in their undershirts and long pyjamas			2
women , however , are still expected to cover their body with a cloak , head covering and a veil according to the country 's strict @entity23 laws			1
men are expected to wear the traditional robe , or ' thawb ' ( pictured ) but many young men are going out in just their underwear ' the commission has not issued any statement about this matter and violations in general are addressed according to the existing regulations , ' @entity30 , a spokesman for the commission , reported @entity1 news website @entity39			1
@entity1 daily @entity40 reported that the commission had called for a ban on young men walking into shopping malls wearing white undershirts and long underpants usually worn under the traditional robes , known as a thawb or dishdasha			1
the commission reportedly took the decision because more and more young men are doing it as an act of rebellion			2
spokesman @entity59 said that complaints about young men ' parading in their undershirts and long underpants in shopping malls ' was often reported by families , the third biggest complaint by shoppers after verbal assaults and harassment			2
he added : ' usually the security services at the shopping malls deal with such incidents and the police intervene only when matters get out of their control			0
' strict : women face persecution if they do n't cover up in @entity1 @entity1 's strict interpretation of @entity23 prohibits men and women who are not immediate relatives from mingling and women from driving			1
the playing of music , dancing and many movies also are a concern for hard - liners who believe they violate religious and moral values			1
a thawb , or dishdasha , is an ankle - length robe commonly worn in @entity92 countries			0
the word thawb is the standard @entity95 word for ' a garment '			0
it is the traditional @entity92 clothing for men throughout the @entity99 and parts of @entity101			2
those who refuse to obey their orders are often beaten by the religious police , known as mutaween , and sometimes put in jail			1
many in @entity1 say they exploit their broad mandate to interfere in people 's lives			1
perhaps the most serious and widely criticised incident attributed to them occurred on march 11 , 2002 , when they prevented schoolgirls from escaping a burning school in @entity115 , because the girls were not wearing headscarves and robes			0
fifteen girls died and 50 were injured as a result			0
widespread public criticism followed , both internationally and within @entity1			2
the many restrictions on women have led to high rates of female unemployment , officially estimated at around 30 per cent			0
the country sent two female athletes to the @entity128 last year , ending the @entity23 country 's record of sending only all - male teams to the @entity132			0
a crowd of @entity1 men in their traditional robes , called thawbs , or dishdasha comments in the @entity1 blogosphere were divided about the underwear issue			1
one posted : ' i can assure you that most of these young men do it not out of conviction , but rather as a daring challenge ' , while another claimed the men do it : ' because they have plenty of free time and no real place where they can use their potential '			0
the second poster was likely referring to high levels of unemployment in @entity1 , estimated to be 35 % among men in their 20s			1
' get them busy by engaging them in activities they like and they will put an end to their unusual behaviour , ' was the advice			0
one took a harsher view : ' they just want to be different even if their outfits clash with good taste and public decency			0
they are moral outcasts who need help			0

religious police say men can walk around in underwear
but women still face punishment if they violate strict clothing laws
