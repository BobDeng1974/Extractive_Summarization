by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 expects @entity3 to captain @entity4 next season			1
one of @entity8 's biggest priorities in his new role as @entity4 boss is to select a captain following the summer exit of @entity13			1
after spending 10 years at the club @entity14 was tipped to take the captain 's armband , but @entity18 skippered the @entity20 national side at the @entity21 and he enjoys a good relationship with the new man in charge at @entity25			1
' @entity3 was his captain of @entity36 , so that is an obvious one , ' @entity4 's former ' @entity35 ' said			1
' i would be really surprised if he did n't give @entity39 it			0
' the close bond between @entity30 and @entity18 was clear to see throughout the @entity21			2
the pair spoke publicly about their admiration for each other and @entity18 raced over to the bench following his stunning opening goal against @entity48 to give his manager a big high five			0
main man : new @entity4 boss @entity8 ( right ) also selected @entity18 as the @entity36 captain @entity30 defied his critics to guide @entity36 to the semi-finals of the @entity21 before they were knocked out by @entity55 on penalties			1
@entity2 believes @entity36 's run to the last four bodes well for @entity4 , who finished seventh last year under @entity59			1
' he has been a winner all his coaching career so hopefully he will install that back into the club , ' said @entity2 , who played 461 times during a 13 - year spell at @entity4			1
' in the @entity21 @entity36 were very good			2
tactically he got them really well - drilled and i thought they were very unlucky			0
i thought they were better than @entity55 , and they could have gone all the way			0
' @entity30 has put his squad through tough training sessions since landing in @entity72 , where @entity4 kick off their pre-season campaign on wednesday against @entity74			1
the players in the 25 - man squad , which includes new signings @entity77 and @entity79 , have been keen to impress their new manager , who was appointed as @entity59 ' successor in may			0
the pain and disappointment of last year 's dismal showing under the @entity85 will also be driving the players on , according to @entity2			2
' the fans and the club were disappointed last year , but nobody hurts more than players , ' said @entity2 , who won two @entity91 , one @entity92 and three @entity93 during his time at @entity25			2
figurehead : @entity18 helped guide @entity36 to third place in the @entity97 ' i know these players			2
they have won the title , the @entity101 , and a lot of them were really disappointed about what happened so the lads that are still at the club will want to bounce back , they will want to prove to people that they are top players and they can win things			0
' @entity2 thinks @entity4 could fall short though unless they sign a centre - back			1
last season @entity4 conceded 43 goals			2
after losing @entity13 , @entity112 and possibly @entity113 , @entity2 is concerned @entity4 lack experience in their back line			2
' when you lose three class defenders like that you need to bring in a really top - drawer centre - half to the club			0
that would really give us a chance of winning the title , ' @entity2 said			0
in charge : @entity30 in action during a training session as part of @entity4 's pre-season in @entity72 ' you look back over the years and @entity4 have had @entity13 and @entity129 as a pairing , @entity131 ( @entity132 ) and @entity133 ( @entity134 )			1
' then we had @entity135			0
he was a really dominant and aggressive player and we need one of those to come in to the club			0
' @entity2 believes @entity139 would have been the ideal signing for @entity4			1
stalwart : @entity14 ( right ) had been tipped to become @entity30 's captain at @entity25 @entity143 will continue to spend - @entity144 the 22 - year - old @entity36 centre - back joined @entity146 from @entity147 on wednesday after enjoying a successful @entity21 under @entity30			1
' he really impressed me in @entity149 , especially against @entity55 when they were up against it , ' @entity2 said			0
' he had a really good tournament			0
