would you go to a concert where you watch a video of a popstar that does n't really exist ? it might sound bizarre , but it ’s the latest craze currently taking @entity5 by storm - and the star herself has now made her way to the @entity9			1
named @entity10 , the computer generated character sings songs created by her fans using voice software and then performs for wild crowds on a screen at the front of an arena			1
the character was designed as a mascot for software called @entity26			1
now fans have created songs for her and regularly watch her in concert			1
she has a huge following in @entity5 and recently performed in @entity32 @entity10 was created by @entity5 music technology company @entity33			1
she was originally intended as just a mascot for voice software called @entity26 2 , made by @entity36			1
but when users of the software were given the ability to make her sing songs they had written , it quickly became apparent she had the makings of a worldwide superstar			0
she has proved to be a smash hit in @entity5 , and last week performed in @entity32 for the first time , at the @entity48 in the @entity49			2
the character appears as a 16 - year - old girl that has her hair in pig tails and her name translates as the ‘ first sound of the future ’ - perhaps heralding a belief she will lead to a revolution in the music industry			2
@entity62 is a digital avatar created by @entity5 technology firm @entity33 that customers can purchase and then program to perform any song on their computer			2
she is supposed to be 16 years old and five foot two inches tall but her makers have given little away about her personality			0
@entity70 uses voices recorded by actors and then puts them through @entity36 ’s @entity26 software to create its characters			2
@entity62 ’s voice was created by taking vocal samples from the voice actress @entity77			0
all of the samples contained a single @entity5 sound which when strung together would create full words and phrases			0
her music and image have proved so popular that she has now gone on a sell - out tour where thousands of fans wave light sticks and scream as if she is a real - life pop star			1
while her voice is synthesised , its origins come from @entity5 voice actress @entity77			0
and perhaps one of her most interesting aspects is that all the songs she performs ‘ live ’ are created by her own users , in a sense being crowdsourced			0
‘ it 's not just celebrating the idol ; the fans are celebrating themselves , ' said @entity98 , the global marketing manager at @entity99 , according to @entity100			0
@entity70 says more than 100,000 songs have been made by fans , in addition to more than 170,000 @entity105 videos and more than a million works of fan art since she was ' born ' on 31 august 2007			0
when @entity10 performs , fans wave glow sticks wildly and sing along to her songs			1
she sings her most popular songs on stage , initiates ' call and response ' routines with the crowd and dances around as well - just like a real popstar			2
being a virtual star , though , she can also do things that her real counterparts can not - such as exploding in a shower of light			2
@entity10 has even toured with @entity124 , appearing ‘ on stage ’ during her @entity126 concert in @entity127 in may this year			1
it remains to be seen quite how big an impact she 'll have in the @entity131 , though			0
earlier this year a hologram of the late @entity133 was projected at the @entity134 in @entity135			0
the eerily realistic projection ' sang ' and ' danced ' to @entity137 and even moonwalked across the stage			0
mesmerising : a hologram of @entity133 performed at the @entity134 in may this year the onstage resurrection garnered a standing ovation by the audience , who were clearly moved by the performance nearly five years after the legendary performer 's death - but it almost did n't happen at all			0
only several days before the awards ceremony did a federal judge rule that the @entity134 could use the hologram , rejecting efforts from tech companies seeking to block the digital performance			0
the songs @entity10 performs are made by her fans using software called @entity26 2 ( shown )			1
her fans wave glowsticks and scream and shout when she performs - just like a real popstar			1
earlier this year the virtual star even toured with @entity124			1
