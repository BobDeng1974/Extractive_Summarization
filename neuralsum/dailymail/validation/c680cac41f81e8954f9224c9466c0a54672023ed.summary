@entity0 has vowed that the ‘ real @entity8 ’ will roar into @entity1 to try and salvage a @entity3 title win on saturday , amid continuing criticism of the performance in defeat to @entity7			1
@entity8 face a major challenge to retain the championship with @entity11 enjoying a better points difference and @entity7 expected to run up a big total against @entity14 in @entity15			1
however , the @entity16 were left fuming on monday night after it emerged there will be no trophy to present to @entity19 in the @entity20 even if it transpires after the final match of the day between @entity11 and @entity23 that the @entity16 are champions			2
@entity0 has vowed that the ‘ real @entity8 ’ will try to salvage a @entity3 title win there are two @entity3 trophies and one will be in @entity1 , and the other in @entity28 , a planning decision that has caused anger amongst some @entity16 supporters			1
it will require a more coherent and less error - addled performance from @entity8 to defeat the @entity34 , and @entity0 did not shirk the challenge laid down before he and his team - mates			1
‘ this week will be a big test and will give a really strong insight into the group as a whole , how we react after a very disappointing defeat , ’ the full - back said			1
‘ we ’ll see the real @entity8 step up this week			1
a lot of us who underperformed last week know if we get the opportunity , [ we have ] to right a lot of those wrongs			2
’ @entity8 ’s message for the week appears to have been decided : they will say they have no interest in chasing a big points total against winless @entity53 , but @entity0 did intimate that at least the desire for a more attacking style is there			1
the impression was of players straining , impatient for their coaches to let slip the leash			0
yet whether it is admitted or not , the sense in salting away as big a points difference as possible is evident given @entity11 ’s superior figures and the fact that they are hosting underwhelming @entity23			0
@entity7 will also be confident of eating into the @entity67 and @entity11 points ’ advantage against @entity14			1
‘ i think any time you get to the last game of a championship you can go and play a bit , ’ said @entity0 on the question of style			2
‘ when i say that , it ’s important the wrong perception is n’t picked up here and that we ’re going to chase this game and we ’re going to try and build points , because we ’re not , ’ he quickly added			0
@entity7 dash @entity8 's @entity82 hopes - highlights @entity8 will need a more coherent and less error - addled performance to defeat @entity53 ‘ but we do know that we have to go out and give this game a right bash			1
it ’s important to get the win but how we do that will be no different to over the last three or four weeks			2
’ the @entity8 style council remain unmoved by criticisms of their game , and the claim in its aftermath that they were forced to work outside the strict instructions provided by @entity97 in chasing the match last saturday			1
that explained the dislocated moves close to the @entity7 line , goes this argument			1
‘ we have good confidence in our running game , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ we were just getting a lot of value from our kicking game			0
if you launch up a ball and it travels 40 metres and you get it back , that is the equivalent of a 40 - yard line break which is very hard to come by			2
‘ i think the other side of that is maybe we were chasing the game a bit from early so maybe we were forced to keep the ball in hand a little bit more and try and go after the game			0
’ they could n’t do so , but there is little expectation of significant changes being made by @entity97 for the trip to @entity53			2
one of the rare positives to survive the journey to @entity7 was the fitness of the squad			2
@entity8 were criticised for their poor performance in @entity3 defeat by @entity7 no new casualties were sustained , and it is certain that the coach will stay largely faithful to the team that started in the @entity134			1
@entity135 was the most dynamic of the subs used against @entity7 and is the most probable point of discussion in team selection this week , with a start in the second row rather than the back row a possibility			1
there have also been calls from some for the addition of @entity148 to the replacements ’ bench			0
@entity0 admitted that when a team is changed it can sharpen the attention of everyone within the group			0
‘ it keeps everyone on their toes			0
i think every single player has been dropped at some stage in their career			0
it ’s happened to the very best of guys			0
you ’ve got new guys coming into the team and they bring a huge amount of energy and excitement because they ’re finally getting their chance			0
‘ the guys who performed under par realise that maybe they have been given a second chance and they really need to pull their socks up			0
‘ i think when that does happen there can be some positives taken from it			0

@entity8 looking to *bounce* back from defeat by @entity7 in @entity3
the @entity67 can still win championship by beating winless @entity53
