by @entity0 published : 09:56 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 10:11 est , 11 march 2014 @entity2 , the teenager who collapsed and almost died after drinking cocktails of energy drinks and @entity5 , now says she drank just four @entity6 , which she believes which triggered her three heart attacks			1
speaking on @entity9 's @entity8 , @entity2 , 18 , said that she had met up with friends after work earlier this year and had four cocktails in two hours			1
@entity6 , a mixture of caffeine - rich energy drinks and the @entity16 alcoholic spirit @entity5 , have become extremely popular with young people who often knock them back in one shot			1
i went home , went to bed and felt perfectly normal			2
' however she did admit that she has no memory of the night or the following morning , saying : ' i 'm relying on what everyone else has told me			1
' the next morning @entity2 collapsed in the bathroom of the family home near @entity35 , @entity36			1
said @entity22 : ' i was downstairs in the kitchen and i heard a massive thump			2
@entity2 's mum then screamed at me to get up there			1
' @entity2 said she had gone to bed as normal			1
the next day she had three heart attacks when he got upstairs , he discovered his daughter lying on the floor			1
' she was purple , ' he said			2
' it was every parent 's worst nightmare			2
' while @entity2 's mum @entity48 , 38 , dialled 999 , quick - thinking @entity22 stayed calm and started pumping his daughter 's chest in a desperate attempt to keep her alive			1
' i 've got to thank @entity53 and those adverts he did with the tune ' staying alive , ' said @entity22			2
' it just clicked in my head and i just started doing it			0
' later the paramedics who attended to @entity2 told him that without his actions it would have been ' highly unlikely ' that they would have been able to save her			1
@entity2 's quick - thinking father @entity22 performed cpr to the tune of ' staying alive ' which probably saved her @entity2 , who had suffered two cardiac arrests on the bathroom floor , was taken to the intensive care unit at @entity69			1
she then had a third arrest and was then put in a 52 - hour coma to protect her brain and heart			1
her body was cooled to just 32 degrees to protect her brain and her family faced an agonising wait to see if she would recover			0
she then had to spend another three weeks in hospital and had an internal defibrillator fitted to get her heart started again in case she has another attack			1
@entity22 , 38 , said that he remembered the @entity84 adverts in which @entity53 does cpr @entity22 said it was a mystery as to why she had such a bad reaction to the drinks as she had previously drunk @entity6 with no bad effect , and had no reaction to other caffeinated drinks such as coffee before			2
' we had no idea that this sort of thing could happen , ' he said			0
this @entity8 's dr @entity97 said that such a massive reactive to caffeine was ' thankfully very rare ' but warned that ' caffeine is a stimulant , it can make you more alert and we say that you should n't really have more than 400mg in a 24 - hour period [ equivalent to around four cups of coffee ]			0
@entity2 and @entity105 were joined by dr @entity106 who said that people should watch their caffeine intake ' some energy drinks can have as much as 200mg in a can and you were clearly very sensitive to caffeine , ' she told @entity113			1
she added that sometimes the labelling on energy drinks could be wrong , giving a misleading impression of how much caffeine they contained			0
@entity119 of the @entity121 @entity120 said that people should drink caffeinated drinks ' in moderation ' and that they were not recommended for people with a sensitivity to caffeine			0
@entity127 's tough guy @entity53 demonstrates cpr in the @entity84 advert one in ten @entity121 teenagers consumes four to five energy drinks a week high in sugar , cleverly marketed and sold in supermarkets and shops alongside regular soft drinks , it 's easy to see why young people in their masses have taken to energy drinks			2
last year , a major study found our children have one of the highest consumption rates in @entity144			0
one in ten @entity121 teenagers consumes four to five energy drinks a week			0
worryingly , younger children are following suit : one in four under - tens - 24 per cent - has had at least one energy drink in the past year , compared with the @entity144 average of 18 per cent			0
now , experts are calling for them to be banned from sale to youngsters			0
in a paper last year , dr @entity153 , editor of the @entity154 , says caffeine should be regulated just like cigarettes and alcohol			0
' although caffeine has been widely considered to be benign , awareness is increasing that its consumption is associated with substantial harm , including fatalities and near - fatalities , ' he wrote			0
' how many caffeine - related fatalities and near - misses must there be before we regulate ? ' in january month , a government adviser compared energy drinks with drugs , and urged schools to ban them			0
some schools have done so , with many teachers complaining the drinks affect behaviour and concentration			0
and a 2011 study in @entity178 reported on a number of cases where excessive caffeine consumption in energy drinks had been associated with effects such as ' seizures , mania , stroke and sudden death '			0
the researchers warned that high caffeine drinks were particularly risky for children with existing conditions such as heart arrhythmias , diabetes or mood and behavioural disorders , which may be undiagnosed .			2
