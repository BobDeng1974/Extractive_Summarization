racism has been condoned at the @entity1 as all - white sororities win their fight to ban black students from applying			0
a group of 27 student senators blocked a bill to fully integrate fraternities at the establishment from reaching a public vote , with just five in favour , and two abstentions			1
it has sparked outrage as critics blast the ' backwards ' state of student societies more than half a century after the university first granted black students entry			1
uproar : student senators at the @entity1 have been blasted for voting 27 to five , with two abstentions , against racial integration within fraternities the conflict emerged after the student newspaper @entity24 published an article last year reporting all - white groups had accepted two black applicants			1
the paper reported that @entity30 society members blamed their alumni for ' stepping in ' despite their attempts to back the student 's application			0
since 1963 , only one black student had been permitted entry into the @entity38 system , so - called because each ' frat ' is named after a letter of the @entity38 alphabet			1
another mixed race student was granted a place , but it is claimed they did not reveal their race until they had been accepted			0
tabling a motion to integrate students in sororities last september , university president @entity47 said : ' i am confident that we will achieve our objective of a @entity38 system that is inclusive , accessible and welcoming to students of all races and ethnicities			2
' we will not tolerate anything less			0
' her words came after hundreds of students turned out for a protest on the 50th anniversary of black students being admitted to the establishment , calling for change			2
the resolution was intended to wipe clean the university 's reputation for segregation more than half a century after the first black students were admitted and in an initial bid to encourage diversity , ms @entity47 ruled that sororities could be bigger , and accept students at any time of year , as opposed to the previously strict admissions process			1
however , friday 's ruling has caused a major set - back in the fight to stamp out racism			0
the resolution had proposed ' the complete integration of all @entity38 letter fraternities and sororities at the @entity1 , with respect to social diversity among its membership '			1
though it would not have had the power to change the @entity38 system 's policy , the amendment was billed as a statement that the student body supports integration			1
it was also an attempt to clean the university 's ' stigmatisation ' in the media over the saga			0
last year , students held a rally fighting for integration that sparked a resolution to be tabled last week , but it failed to pass but the measure will now have to be re-written and re-tabled next year if it is to pass			2
speaking after the debate , @entity108 , lead sponsor of the resolution , told the @entity24 : ' i think that this reflects our @entity113 poorly but also accurately			0
i do n't believe that i put anyone in a @entity116			0
they chose to vote on it and they chose to vote it down			0
' @entity121 , an @entity1 student who co-sponsored the measure , told the paper : ' i think ultimately the reason that it failed to pass was it gave the impression , i think maybe , that – to a lot of the senators – that maybe we were attempting to disparage the @entity38 community , you know , which was n't the case			1
' ultimately , the resolution was to just encourage further integration based on diversity , specifically racial diversity on our campus , which i think a lot of people would agree with			2
