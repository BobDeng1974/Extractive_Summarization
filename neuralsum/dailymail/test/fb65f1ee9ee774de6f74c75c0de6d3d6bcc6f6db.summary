the arrival of an advanced group of modern humans in @entity4 40,000 years ago played a role in the demise of @entity7 , scientists have claimed			1
neanderthals were the dominant human species in @entity4 and much of @entity10 for around 250,000 years before vanishing entirely 41,000 years ago			0
now scientists have found proof that a group of modern humans known as the @entity16 culture arrived in southern @entity4 at around the same time the @entity7 disappeared			1
scientists took ct scans of teeth found at @entity20 in western @entity21 ( left ) and in the @entity22 in western @entity23 ( right ) , both in @entity24 , and found they belonged to ancestors of modern humans who were part of a group known as the @entity16 culture they have been able to conclusively show that a pair of ancient baby teeth found at two prehistoric sites in northern @entity24 belong to modern humans from this culture			1
it has settled a debate that has raged since they were discovered in 1976 , and later in 1992 , over whether the teeth and other artefacts found with them were neanderthal or @entity39 in origin			0
an incisor found in @entity20 in western @entity21 in 1976 , and an upper incisor found in 1992 , in the @entity22 in the western @entity23 in @entity24 are among only three remains thought to have belonged to the @entity16 culture - an early group of humans			1
dr @entity46 and his colleagues at the @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity24 , whose work is published in the journal @entity52 , used ct scans of a tooth found in @entity20			0
they found that the enamel on the crown of the teeth was thicker than that found on @entity7 teeth and it was more similar in morphology to modern humans			1
radio carbon dating also showed that it was 40,000 years old			0
using advanced scanning and dna analysis , researchers have now been able to prove that these teeth belonged to @entity16 humans and are the oldest modern human remains in @entity4			1
they suggest it was the arrival of this modern human culture that marked a turning point in humanity ’s evolution and led to the rapid disappearance of @entity7 in the face of their more advanced cousins			2
the @entity80 culture that followed the arrival of these first modern humans produced the world ’s earliest known musical instruments and the oldest wall art. they also produced advanced bone and antler based weapons , and are thought to have been behind a 40,000 - year - old sculpture known as the @entity91			1
dr @entity46 , an archaeologist at the @entity93 in @entity24 said : ‘ what the results mean is that these two teeth represent the oldest @entity4 modern human fossils currently associated with an @entity80 - related archaeological context			2
‘ human fossil material is very rare , particularly well preserved deciduous teeth			0
‘ this finding suggests that the arrival of our species on the continent might have triggered the demise of @entity7 , which likely disappeared around 39,000 years ago			2
’ there are very few archaeological remains of the @entity16 culture from when they arrived in @entity4			1
the baby teeth , found at two sites in north @entity24 shown above , are two of just three @entity113 remains using advanced scanning and dna analysis , researchers have proved the teeth belonged to this culture and that they are the oldest modern human remains in @entity4			1
they suggest it was the arrival of this modern human culture ( infant skull pictured left ) led to the rapid disappearance of @entity7 ( skull pictured right ) this fragment bird bone was engraved by inhabitants of a rock shelter at @entity20 in north west @entity24 and is now known to have been made by the first modern humans in @entity4 who arrived 40,000 years ago ct scans of the incisor found at @entity20 ( above ) showed it had thicker enamel than @entity7 teeth and it was more similar in morphology to modern humans			1
radio carbon dating also showed that it was 40,000 years old an incisor found in @entity20 in western @entity21 in 1976 , and an upper incisor found in 1992 , in the @entity22 in the western @entity23 in @entity24 were among only three remains that thought to have belonged to this early group of humans			2
they are often depicted as dim - witted evolutionary losers , but @entity7 were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains			0
instead , it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors , scientists believe			0
an analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years strips away some of the myths surrounding @entity7 and reveals they were more advanced and sophisticated than has widely been thought			2
many researchers believe the differences between the two human species are not enough on their own to account for the demise of the @entity7			0
neanderthals have been found to make stone tools and even made jewellery			0
eight talons taken from a white - tailed eagle found at @entity7 site in @entity167 in @entity168 were used to create a necklace or bracelet 130,000 years ago			0
they were found alongside a series of stone blades that had been made using advanced knapping techniques , other tools and simple ornaments			0
however , it has also been suggested that the teeth may have belonged belonged to @entity7 , meaning they had also been capable of this advanced technology			0
dr @entity46 and his colleagues at the @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity24 , whose work is published in the journal @entity52 , used ct scans of a tooth found in @entity20			0
they found that the enamel on the crown of the teeth was thicker than that found on @entity7 teeth and it was more similar in morphology to modern humans			1
radio carbon dating also showed that it was 40,000 years old			0
researchers at the @entity195 also managed to extract mitochondrial dna from the tooth found at @entity22			0
they found it matched that of pre-agricultural modern humans			2
the researchers say that the findings prove that by 41,000 years ago modern humans of the @entity16 culture were spreading across southern @entity4			1
they believe that the advanced culture of these modern humans allowed them to outcompete and perhaps even overpower the @entity7 who were established there			1
however , their results can not exclude the possibility that the teeth came from individuals who were the result of interbreeding between @entity7 and modern humans			1
previous research has shown that the two species did interbreed and some researchers have suggested @entity7 became absorbed into modern human populations			0
one of the teeth was found during an excavation of the @entity22 in northern @entity24 ( shown above )			1
the samples were found alongside a series of stone blades that had been made using advanced knapping techniques , other tools and simple ornaments evidence uncovered at the @entity20 rock shelter ( above ) suggests those who were living there 40,000 years ago had relatively advanced culture and technologies and so may have out competed @entity7			2

two incisors found in northern @entity24 have been *confirmed* to belong to modern humans who were part of the @entity16 culture in @entity4
these *people* had sophisticated tool making , early art and wore ornaments
their arrival in southern @entity4 *coincided* with demise of the @entity7
researchers used @entity251 and dna analysis to identify origin of teeth
