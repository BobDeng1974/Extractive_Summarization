pope @entity0 warned during a visit to @entity2 today that religion can never be used to justify violence , making apparent reference to the bloodshed wreaked by the @entity8 group in @entity9 and @entity10			1
' let no one consider themselves to be the armour of @entity15 while planning and carrying out acts of violence and oppression , ' the pontiff said in speech at the presidential palace in @entity21 in front of @entity2 's leaders			1
' may no one use religion as a pretext for actions against human dignity and against fundamental rights , ' he said			0
' to kill in the name of @entity15 is a grave sacrilege			0
to discriminate in the name of @entity15 is inhuman			0
while the @entity40 insisted no special measures were being taken , @entity2 's @entity39 promised ' maximum ' protection from 2,500 police and beefed - up patrols at border crossings			1
@entity0 ' interactions with the crowds were also much reduced compared to his previous foreign trips			2
his open - topped vehicle sped down @entity21 's main boulevard , not stopping once for him to greet the faithful , as is his norm			2
he said : ' all believers must be particularly vigilant so that , in living out with conviction our religious and ethical code , we may always express the mystery we intend to honor			0
' this means that all those forms which present a distorted use of religion must be firmly refuted as false since they are unworthy of @entity15 or humanity			0
' @entity0 has said it was legitimate to use force to stop the @entity66 extremists , but that the international community should be consulted on how to do so			1
pope @entity0 has used the visit as an opportunity to denounce how religion has been ' perverted ' to justify violence			1
@entity0 told prime minister @entity72 at the start of his 11 - hour visit sunday that @entity2 's inter-religious harmony was an ' inspiring example ' for the world , showing that @entity79 - @entity66 coexistence was not only possible but beneficial for a country 's development			1
he said : ' this is especially the case in these times in which authentic religious spirit is being perverted by extremist groups , and where religious differences are being distorted and instrumentalized			0
' snipers watch on from a building roof as crowds gather below for the @entity90 which will take place today pope @entity0 greets the media during an airborne press conference on his flight to @entity2 this morning it was reported @entity2 law enforcement had flagged to @entity98 concerns that @entity66 militants who trained in @entity9 and @entity10 had returned and might pose a threat to @entity0			1
the @entity101 has downplayed the reports , and @entity0 has used the same open - topped vehicle he uses in @entity104			1
that said , even at the @entity40 security has been beefed - up in recent days : more barricades and police were out in force during @entity0 ' weekly general audience this past week and @entity112 media reported security had been doubled			2
@entity2 police said they had the situation under control , though security was tight sunday : people attending the pope 's @entity90 were told to avoid wearing heavy clothing since they would be checked by police and not to bring bags , suitcases or glass bottles			1
' there is no threat to the pope 's security			2
we have undertaken all the measures and everything will go well , ' police chief @entity129 told reporters after a meeting with interior minister @entity135 on final security arrangements			2

during this time , hundreds of priests and imams were jailed , scores executed			0
@entity0 paid tribute to these martyrs and those from other faiths , saying they showed witness to their faith even under persecution			0
' recalling the decades of atrocious suffering and harsh persecutions against @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 , we can say that @entity2 was a land of martyrs , ' he said in his homily			0
deviating from his text , @entity0 thanked @entity2 for their ancestors ' sacrifice , recalling the national symbol of the eagle			2
' do not forget your wounds , but do n't avenge them , ' he said			0

the @entity101 has voiced mounting concern about the exodus of @entity79 from lands where @entity79 communities have existed for 2,000 years			0
last month the @entity0 , who has often condemned the concept of war in @entity15 's name , said it would be legitimate for the international community to use force to stop ' unjust aggression ' by @entity8 militants who have killed or displaced thousands of people in @entity9 and @entity10 , many of them @entity79			2
