by @entity0 @entity1 is well known for being a nation of animal lovers and now a new concept from the east is set to enable the cat - lovers amongst us to take their obsession to a new level			1
the first ever ‘ cat café ’ is set to open in @entity10 later this year if enough funding can be raised on the crowd funding site indiegogo.com			2
a cat café is essentially a normal café ; serving sandwiches , cakes teas and coffees , the only difference being it is filled with cats , which roam the café freely for you to pet and play with			1
the brains behind bringing this feline phenomenon to the @entity1 is @entity32			1
@entity32 points out : ‘ if something exists you can probably get it in @entity10 , but there ’s one thing that lots of people living in @entity10 ca n’t have – a kitty			2
‘ we thought long and hard about who would really benefit from having a cat café in @entity10			0
' i see commuters walking on their way to and from the station stopping to pet the neighbourhood cats , and since i am unable to own a cat myself due to my current flat and long hours i understand the desire to have a cat around			2
' cat cafes have been a massive hit in the east with hundreds now open in @entity28 , @entity47 and @entity46 feline friends : both cat and customer feel pampered and loved in a cat cafe the café is aimed at the vast number of office workers who have landlords that do n’t allow pets , small living quarters and long working hours and who may pine for a cat companion but are unable to own one			1
while it would also undoubtedly be a hit with tourists , novelty seekers and parents with small children			0
furry nice : as a nation of cat lovers , a cat cafe would allow those who ca n't own a pet to have contact and play with felines whenever they liked @entity104 's @entity30 would have an opulent @entity106 decor to help both customers and kitties relax in the height of luxury			1
their website explains the concept behind the café : ‘ it 's not just about being able to play with the cats			2
it 's about the whole experience : a small indulgence , a place to forget about your day and unwind			0
it 's about coming in from the cold to a comfortable wingback chair , a hot cup of tea , a book , and a cat			0
’ but what about the furry stars at the centre of the cat café - the cats themselves ? @entity32 says : ‘ cat welfare is really important to us			1
in particular , we want to make sure we can house cats who do n't have a home to go to			0
king of the cafe : the cats would be specially chosen to ensure they enjoy human company , and the cafe would provide a home to cats who do n't have one ‘ we 're also working with the @entity143 to choose cats that will be happy in the environment that has lots of people in it , and we 're working with them to define a really solid care plan to make sure they 're cared for			0
’ @entity151 is an international crowd funding site which uses social media to raise money for various innovative ideas			0
so far the campaign has raise £ 3,291 out of the £ 108,000 needed to get the café off the ground			1
they have just 44 days left to raise the remaining funds or they wo n’t receive any of the money contributed .			0

cat cafes are hugely popular in @entity164 - there are 100 in @entity49 alone
*establishments* are like normal cafes - serving sandwiches and coffee - but are full of cats that roam freely
customers - many whose *lifestyles* mean they can not have a pet - can play with the cats
stress - *busting* *effects* of stroking cats is well *documented*
*londoner* @entity32 is behind the move to bring the trend to the @entity1 . she needs to raise £ 108,000 to open the cafe
