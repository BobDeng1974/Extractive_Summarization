by @entity0 it is a sight not seen in @entity2 for six centuries			1
the last time storks bred in the wild here was in @entity7 in 1416 , when the @entity8 was raging and @entity9 had just defeated the @entity10 at @entity11			1
these four - year - old birds have built their huge nest on an 18th - century chimney at @entity15 near @entity16 , @entity17			1
making history : the four - year - old storks have built their nest on a chimney near @entity16 in @entity17 they have been spotted mating and experts believe the female could lay her eggs within the next few days			1
estate director @entity27 said : ‘ the building of a nest together is part of their courtship display and an indication that eggs are on their way			2
‘ they were seen copulating around five days ago and we think they were doing it a couple of days either side as well			0
‘ we are pretty confident we will get some young storks			0
it could be that eggs have been laid already but we ca n’t see as the chimney is too high			2
’ sighting : they have been spotted mating and experts believe the female could lay her eggs in the next few days mid-flight : the last time storks bred in the wild in @entity2 was in 1416			1
above , one of the storks collects material storks usually breed in the warmer parts of @entity56 and spend their winters in @entity58			0
some occasionally visit the @entity2 in @entity59 but only around 20 are spotted each year			1
the birds have been bred in zoos here but their wings are pinioned to stop them flying away , which also prevents them building nests in the lofty positions they prefer - often on man - made structures such as rooftops and telegraph poles			1
the pair in @entity16 were bred in captivity in @entity76 and the @entity77 and were bought as chicks by mr @entity27 , who has a policy of not clipping their wings to allow them more freedom			1
he added : ‘ they are resident at the wildlife gardens but they can fly and they are allowed their semi-liberty			0
‘ they go off into the countryside and the @entity90 to feed and they come back here			0
we gave the storks a helping hand by building a structure for their nest on the hall ’s front chimney			2
' but they turned their backs on our handiwork and have built their own nest on one of the rear stacks			2
‘ we attempted to encourage stork breeding in 2008 but sadly the hen disappeared and the male stork flew into a power line and died			0
‘ we are hoping for more success this time			0
it will be a day for celebration if our storks manage to breed successfully in the traditional way			0
’ @entity116 spokesman @entity115 said he was looking forward to the prospect of the birds producing chicks , although he was still waiting for a pair born in the wild to mate			0
he added : ‘ storks visit the @entity2 quite regularly although only a handful come every year			1
‘ the main reason that they have not bred here for hundreds of years is that there are never enough for them to pair up			0
