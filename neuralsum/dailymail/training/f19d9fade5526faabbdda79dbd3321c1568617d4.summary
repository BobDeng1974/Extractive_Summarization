teenage heptathlon star @entity0 has pulled out of @entity2 ’s team for the @entity3 in @entity4 , partly because her father is not allowed to stay in the athletes ’ village			1
@entity0 ’s father , @entity8 , is also her coach and would therefore have been eligible for accreditation , but would have only been allowed day passes into the athletes ’ village			1
@entity2 will provide chaperones for all athletes at the @entity3 who are under 18 — including 13 - year - old diver @entity14 and weightlifter @entity15 , 15 — but there is no scope for parents or guardians to stay among the expected 6,500 athletes in the village			1
she is also second behind @entity22 on the @entity34 all - time list after scoring 6,081points in @entity36 , @entity37 last month			2
@entity26 ’s preference this summer was to do the heptathlon at the @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42 and then the high jump in @entity4 , but @entity44 would not allow her to double up			0
she will now hope to be selected for @entity46 ’s team at the @entity47 from july 22 to 27 , — a single - sport , much smaller event than the @entity3			2
this would allow greater contact with her father and might also be a better option for her exciting long - term prospects			0
star : @entity0 , 17 , has already broken @entity22 's @entity28 junior heptathlon record new home : the @entity56 for the 2014 @entity3 in @entity4 but @entity0 cleared a high jump personal best of 1.93m in @entity58 in may , the second highest jump by a @entity28 athlete this year , and could yet earn her first senior international vest this year at the @entity62 in @entity63 next month			1
the reasons behind @entity26 ’s withdrawal from the @entity66 should enable @entity2 to call up another athlete to replace her and compete alongside @entity68 and @entity22 , the favourite for gold , if required			2
meanwhile , marathon world record - holder @entity70 has announced she will race competitively for the first time in more than two years as she targets one final attempt at the @entity74 on 2015			0
foot surgery ruled @entity70 , 40 , out of the @entity76 , but she will run in the @entity77 10k on september 21			0
back in action : @entity70 has announced she will race competitively for the first time in more than two years at the @entity77 10k on september 21			0

@entity0 has pulled out of @entity2 ’s team for the @entity3
@entity0 ’s father and coach @entity8 is eligible for accreditation for day passes
but no parents or guardians can stay in the village with the 6,500 athletes
@entity0 , 17 , has just finished her as level exams but has already broken @entity22 ’s @entity28 junior heptathlon record
