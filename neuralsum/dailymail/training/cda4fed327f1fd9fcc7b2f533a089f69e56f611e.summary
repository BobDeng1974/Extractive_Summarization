by @entity0 published : 18:59 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 20:12 est , 22 january 2014 it is not only on the football pitch where @entity4 have slipped			2
the annual @entity5 by @entity6 , published on thursday , sees @entity7 overtake the @entity9 champions in earning power too			1
@entity4 actually made more money in 2012/13 than in the previous season but dropped from third to fourth because of the remarkable gains made by the @entity15 treble - winners			1
@entity4 fell out of the top three for the first time in the publication ’s 17 - year history			1
they are expected to rise next year , despite their struggles on the pitch , because of the new @entity9 broadcast rights			0
drop : @entity4 slipped out of the top three of the @entity5 for the first time in the publication 's 17 - year history celebrations : @entity7 , @entity27 winners in 2013 , jumped to third in the football rich list @entity29 : the annual @entity5 by @entity6 sees @entity31 top the overall standings the money table has been compiled by @entity6 since 1997 , and for the first eight years @entity4 were the biggest - earning club in the world only to be overtaken by first @entity31 , then @entity35 and now @entity7			1
@entity4 's fall will concern the club 's shareholders the most , especially since shares on the @entity41 stock exchange are down just above the 15 - dollar mark from an annual high of more than 19 dollars			2
@entity31 stretched their lead at the top , turning over £ 444.7million ( € 518.9m ) last season , compared to second - place @entity35 ’s £ 413.6m ( € 482.6m )			2
@entity7 made £ 369.6m ( € 431.2m ) , just ahead of @entity4 ’s £ 363.2m ( € 423.8m )			1
top of the league : @entity48 's @entity35 ( left ) and @entity49 's @entity31 ( right ) top the rich list @entity51 marked their emergence onto the global scene by beating domestic rivals @entity55 and @entity56 for the first time , largely thanks to a growth in commercial revenues			1
city came sixth overall with £ 271m ( € 316.2m ) , @entity55 seventh with £ 260m ( € 303.4m ) and @entity56 £ 243.6m ( € 284.3m )			1
@entity51 ’s revenues rose by just under £ 40m and it appears as though they will scrape through @entity62 ’s @entity63 test			0
official financial figures for 2012/13 are yet to be released , but that increase should be enough to meet the requirements and avoid the threat of a @entity27 ban			0
climb : @entity51 beat @entity56 and @entity55 for the first time and moved up to sixth in the table seventh heaven : @entity55 are sandwiched between @entity51 and @entity56 with £ 260m worth of revenue flying high : @entity56 currently top the @entity9 table but are eighth in @entity6 's @entity5 4			1
@entity77 £ 85.7m questions over matchday income were aired after figures showed it has doubled in one year – from around £ 20m to £ 39.6m			2
@entity82 , the @entity63 commentator and analyst , said : ‘ it could be that they have taken out a mortgage against one year ’s advance match day income			0
it is certainly a baffling figure			0
’ the @entity6 report said : ‘ the overall revenue increase is driven largely by a growth in commercial revenue as the club expand into new markets and seek to develop its brand internationally			0
the agreement with @entity99 is the centre piece of the club ’s commercial success			0
’ growth : the @entity6 report said @entity51 's partnership with @entity99 is the ' centre piece of the club 's commercial success ' meanwhile , the @entity5 also illustrates how clubs which are taken over by super-rich owners can swiftly see huge increases in revenue			1
in 2009 , @entity51 and @entity110 were 20th and 21st in the table but have seen significant growth , notably in terms of commercial income			0
@entity110 rocketed into the top five after a huge 81 per cent increase on turnover to £ 341.8m ( € 398.8 ) , partly down to the arrival of @entity118			0
the report said : ‘ since @entity120 acquired a controlling stake in the club in june 2011 , @entity110 ’s revenue has almost quadrupled			0
the club has rapidly expanded its commercial portfolio over the last two seasons , whilst the high - profile signing of @entity118 in the second half of the 2012/13 season only served to enhance the club ’s worldwide profile			0
’ money magnet : @entity110 rocketed into the top five , partly down to the signing of @entity118 like @entity51 , the @entity135 champions also benefited from a major sponsorship deal related to the club 's owners			2
@entity110 's @entity139 , which will net the @entity135 club £ 160m annually until 2016 , has eclipsed @entity51 's £ 400m - plus @entity99 deal which is over 10 years			2
all such related sponsorship deals will be studied by @entity62 as part of the @entity146 governing body 's financial fair play rules to ensure they are of ' fair market value '			0
@entity74 have dropped out of the top 10 for the first time since 1999 - the @entity149 are in 12th spot with revenue of £ 206m ( € 240.6m ) behind @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 , while @entity75 are in 14th place with earnings of £ 147.4m ( € 172m )			1
fall : @entity74 dropped out of the top 10 for the first time since 1999 and now sit in 12th spot			1

@entity4 slip from third to fourth in @entity6 's @entity5
@entity4 made more money in 2012/13 than previous season but drop following @entity7 's remarkable gains
