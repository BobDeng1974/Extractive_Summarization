by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor pubs will stay open late for @entity4 games during this summer ’s @entity5 , despite warnings about the dangers of booze - fuelled violence			1
home secretary @entity9 said licensing hours would be extended for @entity12 ’s side taking on @entity13 from 11pm on june 14			2
pubs and clubs could also see their opening times changed if @entity4 reaches the knock - out stages , in the face of opposition from police and town halls			1
pubs will be able to stay open later for @entity24 games in @entity25 , the home secretary @entity9 announced @entity27 minister @entity26 rejected calls for pubs to stay open late to show the match against @entity13			1
but prime minister @entity31 intervened and overruled him			2
the move is good news for @entity4 fans looking to celebrate the team ’s victories or – as seems more likely - drown their sorrows in defeat during this summer ’s tournament in @entity40			2
@entity4 ’s two other group matches against @entity42 and @entity43 kick off at 8pm and 5pm respectively , so will not benefit from the rule change			1
but if the team reach the knockout stages with 9pm kick offs the relaxation could come into play again in the event of extra time			0
in a written ministerial statement , mrs may said : ‘ the government has consulted on whether to relax licensing hours nationally for @entity4 matches with late kick off times during the @entity5 in june and july 2014			1
‘ following this , the government has decided to relax licensing hours nationally to mark @entity4 ’s participation in the tournament			1
‘ the relaxation of licensing hours will relate to the sale of alcohol for consumption on the premises and the provision of late night refreshment in licensed premises in @entity4 , at specified dates and times only			1
’ the new @entity74 @entity4 strip was unveiled today , worn by ( left to right ) @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 the @entity27 previously rejected a request from the @entity81 asking for an extension of licensing times to 1am for the @entity13 game			1
mr @entity26 turned down the proposal , leaving pubs with the option of applying individually to local authorities for a licence extension through the temporary event notice system - at a cost of £ 21 each			2
but the prime minister ordered a rethink			0
ministers have the power to relax the rules to mark an occasion of ‘ exceptional international , national or local significance ’ , as was done for the @entity99 and @entity100			0
in an effort to curb problem drinking , supermarkets and other shops will be barred from selling alcohol at below cost price from april 6 under new licensing restrictions brought in for the @entity5 finals			0
the @entity109 , which represents councils in @entity4 and @entity111 , has argued the issue of which pubs can open late should be ‘ determined locally ’			1
@entity114 , @entity109 licensing spokesman , said : ' a @entity5 summer is always an exciting time and councils understand that watching matches in a local pub is a key part of the whole experience			0
councils also support moves that bring communities together and also help the local economy			0
' however , licensing decisions should be taken locally			0
while councils will always look to grant extensions to well - run and responsible businesses , they need to be able to target their limited resources most effectively and protect residents living close to popular venues from unnecessary disruption			0
' a blanket national relaxation means councils will not be able to plan ahead and minimise any disruption through sensible licensing restrictions but will instead have to react to issues as best they can			0
' @entity138 documents point out that using the power during the @entity5 could lead to ‘ alcohol - related crime and disorder , public nuisance and risks to public safety			0

drinking hours will be extended to as late as 1am for @entity4 matches
but even pubs known for violence will be allowed to stay open late
@entity27 rejected the idea but was *over-ruled* by @entity31
