@entity16 , 37 , has told officials she had consensual and sometimes coerced sex with the officers and a firefighter and was once propositioned by a city worker in @entity22			1
@entity24 's accounts of the liaisons were largely corroborated by her sexual partners and others within the police department and published in a graphic , 59 - page report written in an incredulous tone by the county 's top prosecutor			1
it said the department 's problems investigating crimes might be caused by some high - ranking officers being more interested in having sex with @entity24 - married mother - of - two - than doing their jobs			1
victim : @entity16 , 37 , has told officials she had consensual and sometimes coerced sex with the officers and a firefighter and was once propositioned by a city worker in @entity22 married mother - of - two : @entity24 recounted how she had sex in police cars , cemeteries and motels with different officers and in the parking lot outside a reception that followed the funeral of officer @entity52 ' the investigation revealed an extraordinary amount of sexual conduct that was committed both on - duty and off - duty , ' wrote @entity56 , @entity57 's state attorney , in the report dated june 25			1
' we find the conduct of a number of sworn officers , including some officers of rank , to be at best a waste of taxpayer dollars			2
' at worst their actions indicate a moral bankruptcy that exists amongst some individuals within the ranks at the @entity3			1
' @entity22 police capt @entity72 , the highest - ranking @entity3 supervisor , retired after being named in a wide - reaching sex scandal @entity24 , who has retained an attorney , recounted for @entity56 how she had sex in police cars , cemeteries and motels with different officers â€” and in the parking lot outside a reception that followed the december 2011 funeral of officer @entity52 , who had been fatally shot on duty			1
she also said officers and some supervisors pressured her for sex , groped her while working and texted her photos of their genitalia			1
' she was a target			0
and they knew that they could take advantage of that , so they preyed upon her			0
they preyed upon her , and that 's what 's so sick about it , ' @entity24 's attorney , @entity93 , said during a recent news conference			0
@entity93 's spokeswoman said @entity24 is not granting interviews at this time			0
the @entity1 typically does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault but @entity24 has gone public with her story , appearing alongside her attorney and husband at a recent news conference about the allegations			0
the mother - of - two , is on paid administrative leave			2
three city employees have resigned , and others - such as the former assistant chief of the department - have retired			1
five other officers have been placed on either administrative leave or modified duty			2
the scandal has stunned folks in @entity22 , a city of almost 100,000 people halfway between @entity121 and @entity122			1
' it 's been devastating for the community , ' said @entity125 , who owns a framing shop in the city 's historic downtown			0
' the actions of a few are tarnishing the reputation of a good department			0
' the @entity134 is investigating , while @entity56 's office spent three months interviewing participants and witnesses			0
in his report addressed to @entity22 police chief @entity139 , @entity56 also drew parallels between the sex scandal and other ' shortcomings ' within the department , including recent problems with traffic stops , searches and investigations that have been detailed in @entity148 , @entity22 's newspaper			1
headquarters : nearly a dozen police officers in @entity22 are under investigation after state and local officials uncovered a widespread sex scandal that has unfolded over eight years a report addressed to @entity22 police chief @entity139 , pictured , drew parallels between the sex scandal and other ' shortcomings ' within the department , including problems with traffic stops , and searches ' had these members of your department been more focused on the important responsibilities of law enforcement , rather than pursuing sexual encounters with a civilian analyst , @entity3 might not be in the condition it is today , ' @entity56 wrote			1
@entity139 would n't comment on the report or the scandal - a @entity3 spokeswoman said all comments are being made from @entity174			1
@entity139 was an outsider who had worked in @entity175 and @entity176 when she became the department 's chief in march 2011			0
' our hearts ache for mrs @entity16 and her family , the citizens of @entity22 , and all the families and children who have been affected by this tragedy , ' @entity22 mayor @entity179 wrote in a statement			1
legislative leaders are furious and have asked @entity57 sheriff @entity189 to help get the department on track			0
@entity22 mayor @entity179 said : ' our hearts ache for mrs @entity16 and her family , the citizens of @entity22 , and all the families and children who have been affected by this tragedy ' ' we find the @entity196 's report on the behavior of the @entity3 officials to be shocking , revolting and a clear cause for action , ' wrote rep @entity201 , @entity22			1
' a culture which , at best lacks professionalism and at worst encourages the reckless behavior of @entity207 officials , is apparently pervasive and is an embarrassment to our community			0
this culture has unfortunately eroded the public 's confidence in the @entity3			1
' @entity24 , through her attorney and in the state attorney 's report , said she was unable to fend off the sexual advances because she has been a victim of sexual assault in the past			0
initially , she did n't want to speak with investigators - she balked at turning over her phone with text messages and photos , saying that it would hurt the officers ' families - but later decided to cooperate because she felt victimized and abandoned by the department			1
@entity24 also confided in a female officer friend , who initially doubted the stories until @entity24 showed her some of the text messages and photos she had received from other officers			2
the friend told @entity56 that she thought @entity24 's desire to please , inability to say no and sexual promiscuity made her a target			0
while seven officers admitted to having sexual contact with @entity24 , three other sergeants denied her claims and refused to take polygraph tests			2
@entity56 said he questioned the credibility of those sergeants			0
the report also said that other employees knew about the encounters and did n't report it to higher - ups			2
the state attorney said he could n't prosecute the cases because of a lack of physical evidence and because so much time has passed since some of the sexual encounters			0
however , @entity179 said the officers and employees involved are under an internal investigation and will be ' disciplined to the fullest extent ' if found to have acted inappropriately			0
@entity189 , the sheriff , would n't discuss the legislators ' proposal for him to help the department			0
but in an email to the @entity1 , he said he was willing to help @entity22			2
' my whole family is from @entity22			2
i grew up here , ' @entity189 wrote			0
