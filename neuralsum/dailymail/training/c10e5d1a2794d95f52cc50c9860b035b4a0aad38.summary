by @entity0 published : 08:51 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 09:02 est , 21 may 2013 the reason why penguins can not fly has finally been laid to rest , researchers claim			1
@entity6 can not fly because they are such good swimmers - and no bird can excel at both , said scientists			1
they started to fly through the ocean instead of the air as they developed wing - propelled diving skills that allowed them to forage for food at increasing depths			1
penguins lost the ability to fly as they developed more efficient wing - propelled diving skills that allowed them to better forage for food at increasing depths of the ocean the evolution of flightlessness in penguins has mystified scientists for decades			1
but now a study of guillemots - which closely resemble penguins in their diving and swimming , but can still fly - shows there is no such thing as a wing that 's good for both			1
scientists discovered that guillemots on @entity38 , @entity39 , used substantially less energy than most other birds when they were diving			1
but the energy they needed for flight was the highest ever reported for a flying bird - 31 times greater than expended when at rest			0
there are 18 species of penguin - 13 of which are declining and five of them are considered endangered			0
while most people associate penguins with @entity54 , penguin populations can also be found in @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , as well as many small islands in the southern @entity60			1
while swimming , penguins will leap in shallow arcs above the surface of the water , a practice called porpoising			1
this coats their plumage with tiny bubbles that reduce friction , allowing them to swim as fast as 20 miles per hour the light front and dark colour of classic penguin plumage is called countershading and provides camouflage from above and below to protect penguins in the water			2
@entity80 € ™ eyes work better underwater than they do in the air , giving them superior eyesight to spot prey while hunting , even in cloudy , dark or murky water			0
depending on the species , a wild penguin can live 15 - 20 years			0
during that time , they spend up to 75 percent of their lives at sea			0
professor @entity92 , of @entity93 , said : ' like many people , i wondered why on earth they lost the ability to fly			1
' it 's great to be part of the team that has collected the data that resolves this issue			0
' our findings for the energy expended when diving and swimming by guillemots fit exactly into the predictions of the biomechanical model			1
' the lack of flight in penguins has been an enigma because it leads to some seemingly poorly adapted behaviour			0
' emperor penguins , for example , walk up to 60km between their rookeries and the sea - a journey taking several days that could be covered in a few hours if they were able to fly			2
' also , many penguins are targets of predators such as leopard seals , at the points where they enter the ocean			2
' this problem could be easily avoided if penguins could just fly over the top of the predators			2
' however applying the [ new ] theory to penguins , their loss of flight may have been due to the tradeoffs in maximizing wing function in water versus wing function in air			2
' as penguins evolved , their wings became more and more adapted to swimming and diving in the oceans where they catch their food - making this part of their lives very energy efficient			1
' however at the same time the energy required for flying became greater and greater for the penguin			2
' at some point it simply became impossible to sustain the very high energy costs of flight and the birds became flightless			0
' presumably the efficiency benefits when feeding offset the inefficiency of having to walk everywhere when they were on land			0
' our studies of guillemots have now shown that this biomechanical theory is very likely to be correct			0
' the study monitored guillemots because they resemble penguin ancestors			1
the birds can fly but also swim very efficiently , although flying uses up around 31 times more energy than flying for the species guillemots - members of the @entity178 family of seabirds - are common on the @entity181 coast and breed in large , noisy colonies , with each female laying a single egg on a narrow cliff ledge			1
in pursuit of a meal they perform short shallow dives but they are more than capable of reaching depths of 300ft or more to reach favoured fish and squid			0
@entity6 can dive as deep as 1,850 feet in search of fish , squid and tiny crustaceans called krill but are awkward on land - waddling across the ice or sliding on their bellies			0
professor @entity92 said : ' @entity176 resemble penguins in their diving and swimming behaviour , but differ in that they are still able to fly			1
scientists have been mystified by the penguin 's inability to fly until now ' in many respects they are like a modern equivalent to the ancient ancestors of penguins before they lost the ability to fly			1
' paleontologists have proved penguins could once fly by discovering the density of bone has been increasing over the last 36 million years			2
what this means is a much heavier penguin today compared to its ancestor			0
@entity6 bone used to be hollow			0
birds today are able to fly in part due to the fact that they have hollow bones			2
hollow bones are lighter then dense bones making it easier to fly			0
penguins changed into dense boned , grounded birds , after they followed their food out of the air into the sea			1
@entity235 , a zoologist at @entity236 in @entity237 , @entity39 , said : ' clearly , form constrains function in wild animals , and movement in one medium creates tradeoffs with movement in a second medium			0
' bottom line is that good flippers do n't fly very well			2
' the study was published in @entity248 .			0

experts at @entity93 concluded that penguins started to ' fly ' through the ocean instead of the air as they developed diving skills
added that birds can not have wings that are good at flying and swimming
scientists studied guillemots which resemble ancient penguin ancestors
