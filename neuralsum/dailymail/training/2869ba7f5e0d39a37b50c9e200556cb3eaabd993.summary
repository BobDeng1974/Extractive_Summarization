the wild population is estimated at around 6,000			0

but in 1976 , they were given the highest level of protection and all international trade was banned			0
but the species is still at risk , because their natural habitat is being @entity179			0
the lowland forest in @entity162 has been reduced to five percent of its previous area			0
the cotton - top tamarin is easily spotted by the long white crest reaching from its forehead to its shoulders			1
the emperor tamarin is native to the @entity189 rainforest			0
its name is derived from its imperial - looking long white moustache			2
' now vital members of the breeding group have been taken so we can no longer breed the animals , which is terrifying as they are both endangered species			2
' ' the emperors are really popular in the zoo because they have a big white moustache			2
' visitors come and see them and comment on their moustache and make references to @entity205			0
' the monkeys are loved by visitors of all ages			2
they come right up to the window and they can be very active			0

today the behaviour of the animals is not normal because adults have been taken			2

it is imperative they receive the correct care in order to survive			1

' @entity244 @entity243 said : ' it would appear from the way that these thieves have broken into the zoo that this was a planned and premeditated crime			0
' ' the offenders knew what they were looking for and knew that the monkeys would be in the enclosures			0
' i would appeal for anyone who has any information or any witnesses who saw anything suspicious on tuesday evening or wednesday morning to get in touch			0
