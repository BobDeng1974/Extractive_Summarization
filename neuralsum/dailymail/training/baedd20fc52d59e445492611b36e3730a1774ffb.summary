by @entity0 published : 17:29 est , 22 december 2012 updated : 17:29 est , 22 december 2012 as a constitutional monarch , the @entity1 knows she must remain above the hurly - burly of everyday politics ... but that did n’t stop her majesty from last week making a light - hearted quip about @entity9 ’s controversial sale of @entity11 ’s gold reserves			1
in a conversation with @entity13 , she recalled a visit earlier this month to the @entity16 vaults , where thousands of gold bars are kept			2
she then commented to the chancellor : ‘ i gather not all of the bars belong to us			0
’ mr @entity13 replied , with a slight smirk : ‘ no , @entity23			2
some of them were sold before this government got in , but i ’m pleased to say that we have still got some left			2
’ golden look : her majesty examines the stacks of gold bars stored in the @entity16 's vaults royal inspection : the @entity1 and the @entity35 were shown the vaults at the @entity16 where thousands of gold bars are kept the comment brought laughter from other members of the @entity41 who heard the exchange			1
it took place in the @entity45 10 , when @entity6 became the first monarch to sit in on a peacetime @entity41 meeting since 1781			0
she is said to have maintained a diplomatically impassive expression throughout the conversation			0
the comment was in reference to mr @entity9 selling half of @entity11 ’s gold reserves for £ 2 billion while he was chancellor in 1999 , when the price of gold was at a 20 - year low			1
since then , the value has increased nearly six-fold – meaning the @entity59 has lost more than £ 9 billion			0
hands - on : the queen thoroughly inspects the gold vaults during her visit to the @entity16 value : the vaults contain thousands of bars of gold worth billions of pounds the @entity1 has taken a close interest in the global financial crisis , asking a group of economists in 2008 : ‘ why did nobody notice ? ’ and when she visited the @entity16 vault , she said that watchdogs at the @entity76 ‘ did n’t have any teeth ’			1
