by @entity0 for @entity1 clashing colours , mismatched patterns , dodgy paint jobs and cluttered corners are all on the list of cardinal sins when it comes to designing and decorating a lounge room			1
poor scaling and positioning of furniture , drawing attention to the wrong parts of the space and misguided attempts to make rooms look bigger are also some of the most common faux pas			1
interior stylist and buyer from @entity21 told @entity1 the worst living room she had ever come across was one that featured a checkered couch alongside a brown leather one , which both clashed with the @entity28 rug on the floor			2
the home are searching for @entity32 's @entity31 and interior stylist @entity33 said this one in @entity34 was the worst she had seen so far the space in @entity36 could be a certain contender for the ugliest room with its yellowed walls , cobwebs on the ceiling and a floor and lounge which do n't look safe to sit on this room in @entity32 desperately needs a paint job matching furniture and a bigger tv unit that is n't dwarfed by the television these brightly coloured and very old couches in a @entity50 home also made it onto the terrible list ' mismatched colours equals a confused style , ' ms @entity33 said			1
' @entity28 rugs and a country check fabric do n’t go together			0
stick to similar styles for the big ticket items to keep from confusing the style			0
' she added a paint job on the wall would n't go astray and the rug - aside from clashing with almost everything else in the room - was much too small for the space			1
in light of this , homewares and interior design website @entity66 has launched an effort to find the ugliest living room in the whole of @entity32			2
shocking clashing patterns and couches without proper cushions seen here in a @entity50 living room are a repeat offender this room , also in @entity50 , has an exposed brick wall which ' screams 1980s ' according to ms @entity33 who said the room needed a paint job quick smart in this tiled room in @entity50 the couches clash with the textured tiles and the glass table is outdated more messy than ugly this room in @entity34 would probably look a lot better with a tidy up above all else in conjunction with @entity93 's @entity92 , they have asked homeowners to dob themselves - or their friends - in and the ' winner ' of the competition will get their horrible lounge room replaced with a brand new one			1
' home may be where the heart is , but the living room is the soul of the home			2
it ’s where you relax , rejuvenate and entertain , so you should have a living room you adore , ' said @entity109 , ceo of @entity66			0
' i know there are many neglected living rooms out there in @entity32 , so we want to find the ugliest one and transform it from mess to mesmerising			1
' we also want to show how anyone can easily transform their own living rooms with a few updates and tweaks – it does n’t have to be expensive ! ' ms @entity118 added			2
also in @entity34 this living room is ' too matchy matchy ' and needs another colour besides blue and yellow to break up the space according to ms @entity33 in @entity36 this room needed to be broken up with pattern and texture otherwise you get a whitewash effect like this this space in @entity34 needed one thing desperately - a paint job this outdated living room - also in @entity34 - could do with some upgraded furniture and a little de-cluttering some features of some of the disaster rooms so far include strange and outdated patterns and prints , poor or completely forgotten paint jobs , too many items cluttered in to one room or not enough furniture spread around an area with too much space			1
@entity36 presented a strong contestant for the worst room , with yellowed walls , cobwebs and cracks on the ceiling and a floor and lounge which do n't look safe to sit on			2
the television looks as though it could have been one of the first ever made , and the curtains are straight out of the 1970s			0
in one of the terrible rooms from @entity34 , ms @entity163 said the colour scheme was way off and the owner needed to introduce some more neutral colours to break the room up			0
this @entity50 lounge room was described as ' confused ' and a poor example of a multi-functional living space the small table over a patterned mat covering the floor which matches the couch makes this room a contender for the ugliest room the cluttered corner behind the tv make the space feel smaller than it is , plus the tissues near the heater present a serious fire risk this mismatched furniture crowded around a television in @entity36 put this space in the running for the ugliest in @entity32 ' too matchy matchy			1
this room only has two colours , blue and orange			0
it 's fine to try and match up some of your furniture but add in a few other splashes of colour to break it up , ' she said			1
for another sparse looking situation also in @entity34 , the interior stylist had just one tip : ' do n't forget the most important thing - paint ! ' @entity36 also had some horrors to offer in the form of a disparate lounge room with only one colour tone and a whole lot of space			2
ms @entity33 had this to say : ' throw rugs add colour and texture to a room but not if they are covering your dated recliner chairs			0
also , do n't forget a rug , especially on tiles - winter without a rug looks like a cold one ! ' missing tiles and clashing furnishing make this living space in @entity32 look confused this room is on report for its couches that match the strange textured floor another offender in the bland colour scheme department in @entity36 was too much neutral and not enough of anything else			1
' solid blocks of neutral colour like this need to be broken up with pattern and texture : add in some cushions , a floor rug and some artwork to add interest and personality to the space , ' ms @entity33 suggested			0
for a room in @entity34 clutter was the key concern , and possibly an unwanted house fire			0
' for easy viewing pleasure you should aim to keep the wall the tv is on free , do n't confuse the situation by sticking photos on the wall above			0
also , keep fire hazards to a minimum by storing all your junk and consider moving the tissue box away from the heater ! ' said ms @entity33 .			0

the home is on the hunt for @entity32 's @entity31
some of the worst faux pas are furniture that does n't match
crowded rooms and *unfinished* paint jobs are also a repeat offender
