surgery will cost around £ 5,000			1
‘ the grass was too long , it was much taller than @entity2 - he was buried in the grass			2
we ’ve been complaining to the council for four weeks about the length of the grass outside our home			1
‘ all the tenants on the road have been trying to get the grass cut because it is so long			1
i reported it to the council straight away but they claimed nothing was ever reported to them , which is a complete lie			0
‘ i would like to pursue it and sue them because they are completely responsible and liable for what happened to my poor dog			0
she says she now faces a £ 5,000 veterinary bill which she can not afford to pay mrs @entity0 said the accident has left her husband and their son @entity79 , 17 , feeling ‘ devastated ’ because the family may have to give up @entity2 if they can not raise the money for his operation			1

mrs @entity0 said : ‘ i want to take further action with the council - i would like to sue them			2
‘ it is so unfair we have a dog who needs an operation , but we do not have the money to pay for it - we may be forced to give him up			0
‘ we will have to send him to a vet surgery for an operation and then they will find him a new home			2
but i ca n’t do that , he is part of our family			0

‘ being in our situation , it is difficult - we are on benefits			0
i want to sue the council but we do not have any money to sue them , but it is unfair because the council are definitely liable for what happened			0
