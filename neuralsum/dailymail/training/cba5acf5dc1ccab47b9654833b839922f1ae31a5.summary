@entity0 has taken to @entity1 to defend a photo of her youngest son @entity3 standing on the family dog that sparked outrage			1
the photo , which @entity0 shared on @entity7 , was met with outrage across social media and by @entity10 , who released a statement saying ; ' it ’s odd that anyone — let alone a mother — would find it appropriate to post such a thing , with no apparent sympathy for the dog in the photo			1
' @entity0 's response was written to @entity10 , who described her as a ' callous woman , ' and focused not just on defending the photo but also asking why the organization has never objected to the actions of other celebrities - including president @entity28			1
this after she begins by saying ; ' at least @entity3 did n't eat the dog			2
' the comment is in reference to @entity28 's admission many years ago that as a child in @entity50 he did once eat dog meat , and while how much or little he enjoyed the taste is not known , he did mock @entity0 at the 2012 @entity53 saying ; ' what 's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull ? a pit bull is delicious			1
' @entity0 also asks why @entity10 never attacked @entity59 for a photo that her show 's instagram page posted this past july of a child standing on her dog to brush her teeth , though that child , a little girl , does appear to be much younger and smaller than 6 - year - old @entity3			1
the photos posted by @entity0 were meant to show her son 's resilience , as she wrote of the boy , who has @entity71 ; ' he , determined to help wash dishes with an oblivious mama not acknowledging his signs for " up ! " , found me and a lazy dog blocking his way			2
he made his stepping stone			0
' and in her response , she shared just how much she and her family love all of their animals			0
' our pets , including @entity3 ’s best buddy @entity86 , are loved , spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or do n’t fit your flighty standards , ' says @entity0			2
love : ' our pets , including @entity3 ’s best buddy @entity86 , are loved , spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man , ' wrote @entity0 inspiring : the intial post was meant to inspire people at the start of 2015 by showing @entity3 's resilience she also uses the post to attack @entity10 's opposition to @entity103 's most famous annual event , the @entity104 , calling it ' the @entity104 honoring dogs who are born to run in wide open spaces			1
' she then makes the claim that @entity10 , who she calls ' double - standard radicals , ' keeps some of their pets ' in a concrete jungle where they ’re allowed outdoors to breathe and pee maybe once a day			0
' @entity0 does however say that she and @entity10 do agree on one thing - ' respecting @entity116 ’s creation and critters			2
' @entity10 , president @entity28 and @entity59 have yet to respond to @entity0 's post			1
at least @entity3 did n’t eat the dog			0
hey , by the way , remember your “ @entity121 ” , @entity59 ? did you get all wee - wee ’d up when she posted this sweet picture ? hypocritical , much ? did you go as crazy when your heroic @entity41 , @entity28 , revealed he actually enjoyed eating dead dog meat ? are n’t you the double - standard radicals always opposing @entity103 ’s @entity104 – the @entity104 honoring dogs who are born to run in wide open spaces , while some of your pets “ thrive ” in a concrete jungle where they ’re allowed outdoors to breathe and pee maybe once a day ? are n’t you the same herd that opposes our commercial fishing jobs , claiming i encourage slaying and consuming wild , organic healthy protein sources called “ fish ” ? ( i do			1
) are n’t you the same anti-beef screamers blogging hate from your comfy leather office chairs , wrapped in your fashionable leather belts above your kickin ’ new leather pumps you bought because your celebrity idols ( who sport fur and crocodile purses ) grinned in a tabloid wearing the exact same louboutins exiting sleek cowhide covered limo seats on their way to some liberal fundraiser shindig at some sushi bar that features poor dead smelly roe ( that i used to strip from our @entity162 - caught fish , and in a @entity165 cannery i packed those castoff fish eggs for you while laughing with co-workers about the suckers paying absurdly high prices to party with the throw away parts of our wild seafood ) ? i believe you call those discarded funky eggs “ caviar ”			0
yeah , you ’re real credible on this , @entity10			0
a shame , because i ’ll bet we agree on what i hope is the true meaning of your mission – respecting @entity116 ’s creation and critters			0
our pets , including @entity3 ’s best buddy @entity86 , are loved , spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or do n’t fit your flighty standards			0
@entity190 is a precious part of our world			0
