it is the most damning statistic of all : no goals in eight appearances			2
it is @entity5 's record in @entity7 finals , and his record in major tournaments in general has hardly been inspiring			1
@entity5 has scored five goals in six appearances in @entity13 but four of those came at @entity16 , his breakthrough tournament when the then 18 - year - old was widely acknowledged as one of the stars			1
since then there has been the broken metatarsal and red card of @entity23 2006 , non-qualification for @entity25 , the brooding , angry young man berating supporters at @entity28 2010 , and the player suspended for the first two games of @entity31 and who looked short of match fitness for the two in which he subsequently played			2
it is no record for a player who aspires to be among the world 's greats			2
prior to recent tournaments there has been an attempt to build up expectation and construct a sustainable argument to suggest that this time it will be different			1
but perhaps the climate of major tournaments does not suit @entity5 's physiology ? maybe he is simply more susceptible to the end - of - season fatigue that affects most @entity53 players ? maybe he just is not as good as some think he is , although that theory would not account for the manner in which he can impose himself on @entity59 games			1
certainly @entity61 manager @entity60 accepts that @entity5 is box office and , as such , the demands from the public will always be high			1
' he knows the expectations , ' said @entity60			2
' he knows how much everyone who writes about , watches or discusses @entity68 football demands of him			2
all i can say is i 'm confident he 'll give us the best he 's got			2
you can only hope your attempts to prepare him mean that when he gets on the field he 'll think , " i feel good and i 'm going to do the things that made people build me up so high "			0
' it must be the same for @entity82 film stars			0
when you make your first film and nobody knows much about you , you might get some good reviews			0
but one day you 're going to be [ a superstar like ] @entity87 or @entity88 and suddenly every film you make has to be very good			0
' despite @entity91 's slump , @entity5 has at least had a good season , in which he has seemed leaner and sharper			1
there are no obvious debilitating injuries to fear , the club insisting that he has been rested in the past few weeks to ensure he would be fresh for @entity99 and not because his groin problem was serious			0
previous : @entity5 has failed to score in eight matches at @entity7 finals @entity5 is so determined to be fit for this @entity7 that he headed out to the @entity103 last week , taking not only his family but two physiotherapists to help him prepare for @entity61 's pre-tournament training camp in @entity107 , also in @entity108			1
the first competitive sight anyone will have of him will be against @entity111 on friday week in @entity61 's friendly match at @entity113			1
the pre-tournament arrangements will be better suited to his temperament , too			0
in 2010 it included two weeks ' seclusion in the @entity119 mountains , followed by a remote training ground in rural @entity28			0
@entity122 's intention was to insulate his players but for the likes of @entity5 it proved to be too restrictive			1
under @entity60 and a back - room team of @entity68 staff , the needs of @entity68 players will be catered for better this time			1
@entity129 , the venue for two @entity61 friendlies in the first week of june , and @entity132 , should provide ample stimulation			1
disappointment : @entity5 's appearances at @entity7 finals have been blighted by injury but the key factor in enabling @entity5 to demonstrate his worth may be the players around him			1
the relative abundance of attacking options in @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 as well as the potential fluidity of the team suggests @entity5 ought to feel more at home			1
it may well be the first time in his career in which an @entity61 team has actually been better than the @entity91 team for which he plays			1
' i do n't think we 're going into this tournament with anything to fear , in terms of his commitment , fitness or desire , ' said @entity60			0
' so from that starting point , if you compare it to 2012 , when he could n't play the first two games and he was disappointed and frustrated , then it 's looking better for us			1
' i 'd like to think the squad we 've picked is a very good one , with lots of exciting players			0
he wo n't have to shoulder the total burden of goal - scoring and goal - making , which he has at previous tournaments			0
there are plenty of players out there for us who can score or make a goal			2
so if i was @entity5 , i 'd be thinking : " right , this is looking good , i 've got good players around me , this is a great opportunity "			1
' outburst : @entity61 striker @entity5 shouts at camera after @entity195 game at 2010 @entity7 @entity196 , a former team - mate of @entity5 's and an @entity198 pundit for the @entity7 , agrees that the intensity for @entity5 ought to be reduced this year			1
' i think there is less pressure on @entity5 , ' said @entity196			1
' he still puts himself under the same pressure , but it 's not coming from the media as much as before when he has gone in injured or with off - the - field stuff going on			0
' there was stuff with @entity122 and an unhappy camp in 2010			0
this time i think @entity5 has gone away to get a bit of sun and the fact that he has missed a bit of football over the last month or two is no bad thing			1
' people should n't be panicking			0
i have heard that he has taken medical staff away with him on his holiday - i am sure his wife is delighted with that ! but sometimes you need down - time , the discipline to relax and rest the tendons , the muscles , your fibres , the mind which is probably the most important thing			2
' i 'm guessing but i think @entity5 will be going into the @entity7 in a good mindset and again i think he is surrounded by better players in attacking positions who can see more of a pass than previous squads have going into big tournaments			1
he has gone in on the back of injuries before , i think there has always been that pressure on @entity5			1
but i think he is surrounded by better players now , who are on good form			0
' setback : a dejected @entity5 after @entity61 lost to @entity243 in the quarter final of @entity31 certainly you would hope that the image of an exasperated @entity5 waving his arms in frustration , stranded up front alone as the defence and midfield retreat deeper and deeper , would be consigned to the past			1
clearly there will be periods when @entity61 concede possession and as the deeper - lying striker , @entity5 will be expected to track back			1
equally though , with @entity148 , @entity147 and @entity144 likely to be in the team , @entity61 will at least attempt to play at speed and with some style			1
@entity60 hopes so at least			0
' it gets suggested , " he was a disaster in such and such a tournament " and , therefore , every time i talk about a tournament now i 'm expected to refer back to that tournament and say what a disaster he was , ' he said			2
' but i refuse to go along with that baggage			0
it 's not me who 's said , " 2004 was great and since then it 's been bad			0
" i 'm not saying that			0
' the only thing i would dare talk about @entity5 with regard to tournaments is 2012			1
and there he tried very hard			0
he wanted it very badly			0
you could argue he wanted it too badly			0
' this time i 'm going to see a totally different person - hopefully , the person you 're describing who burst onto the scene in 2004			2
because he 's only 28 years of age , he 's in the best age of his football career			2
i suppose i could say that if he was terrific in 2004 , he should be even better now			0
' in reality , any player who fails to deliver for his nation in major tournaments will be damned by many football judges as having failed to make it into the higher echelons of the game			2
quizzed as to whether this was fair			0
@entity60 reached for a lesson from the team 's resident psychiatrist , @entity301			2
' i 'll give you @entity301 's answer to that one , ' said @entity60			0
' he has n't got far with me because i 'm still making the old mistakes i always make			0
but every now and again there 's a moment of epiphany and one has just come to me : " life is not fair "			0

@entity5 has failed to score in eight matches at @entity7 finals
@entity5 has been a rare plus point this season at @entity91 and he has seemed leaner and sharper
for the first time in his career he may appear in an @entity61 team actually been better than his @entity91 team
