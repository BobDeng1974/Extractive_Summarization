in an alarming development there were also fresh signs of economic ' contagion ' in @entity33 , with unemployment in @entity35 topping five million as its economy went into reverse			1
official figures showed @entity35 's economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year , with unemployment jumping by 400,000 to 5.3 million			1
leading ratings agency @entity42 added to the bleak outlook by threatening to downgrade more than 120 banks , including several major @entity3 institutions , because of concerns about the @entity28			1

lord @entity55 said @entity6 was being forced to choose between the ' utterly impossible and utterly incredible '			2
he warned it now seemed a ' certainty ' that @entity6 would be forced to leave the single currency , leaving the @entity28 facing a ' bleak future '			0
during angry exchanges in the @entity69 a @entity3 @entity67 peer suggested that @entity26 economic policy recalled slogans used by the @entity72			1
lord @entity73 said the @entity26 ' remedy ' in @entity6 was ' austerity macht frei ' - echoing the @entity26 phrase arbeit macht frei , meaning ' work sets you free '			1
the slogan was placed over the entrances to several @entity82 concentration camps , including @entity83			0
@entity85 @entity84 intervened on the @entity87 peer to label the remark ' offensive '			0
the former @entity56 @entity33 commissioner @entity89 said @entity26 's overwhelming economic dominance following the crash was ' dangerous ' for the @entity92			1
he said anti-german feeling was now ' rife in many @entity33 countries ' - a development he described as ' very worrying and disturbing '			1
@entity97 feeling is running particularly high in @entity6 after @entity99 's finance minister @entity98 suggested the country was becoming a ' bottomless pit '			1
some other northern @entity33 countries are also now thought to favour @entity6 leaving the euro			0
@entity6 's 82 - year - old president @entity104 , a veteran of @entity6 's resistance struggle against the @entity82 occupation , hit back angrily on wednesday night , saying : ' who is mr @entity98 to insult @entity6 ? who are the @entity109 ? who are the @entity111 ? ' despite the row there were tentative signs last night that the @entity28 was moving closer to agreeing a bailout deal for @entity6			1
employees of the @entity117 shout slogans during a protest outside the @entity120 in @entity16 today some senior officials suggested a deal could be struck as early as monday			0
but it remained unclear whether the deal will amount to more than a temporary fix , with a final package delayed until after the @entity6 elections expected in april			0
@entity129 president @entity128 yesterday sought to soothe tensions with @entity6 by praising the country 's attempt to deal with an economy in freefall			1
mr @entity128 said : ' i would like to salute the courage of the @entity6 government and the @entity6 people in these very demanding , challenging times			0
today 's market : the @entity141 rose today despite the turmoil in @entity33 ' and i would hope that the member states , the members of the @entity92 will accept the commitments given by @entity6			1
' but several @entity33 capitals retain severe doubts about whether @entity6 is willing or able to impose the level of cuts needed to tackle its debts and remain within the euro			0
in one small symbol of the scale of the challenge facing @entity6 it was reported yesterday that virtually every traffic light in central @entity16 was smashed during anti-austerity riots at the weekend			0
but the transport department is so strapped for cash that it can not afford to replace them , leaving to disastrous congestion in the @entity6 capital			0
' i am not sure even now whether all in the political parties in @entity6 are aware of their responsibility for the difficult situation of their country			0
' that prompted a furious response from @entity6 president @entity104 , an 82 - year - old veteran of the resistance to @entity82 occupation of @entity6 during @entity173 , who lashed out at @entity26 finance minister @entity98			1
@entity98 , who has likened @entity6 to a ' a bottomless pit ' , expressed doubt on wednesday whether @entity16 would stick to new promises adopted by parliament on monday as rioters torched and looted buildings across the capital			0
' i can not accept mr @entity98 insulting my country , ' @entity104 riposted			0
' who is mr @entity98 to insult @entity6 ? who are the @entity109 ? who are the @entity111 ? ' ' @entity186 ' , ran a headline in the conservative @entity189 newspaper , harking back to @entity6 's painful spell under military rule during the 1960s and 1970s			1
other @entity6 newspapers ran banners readeing ' in the gas chamber ' and what the @entity26 want '			0
the front pages of three @entity6 newspapers , depicting @entity26 finance minister @entity98 , from left to right , @entity200 " in the gas chamber , '' @entity199 '' @entity201 '' and @entity203 '' what the @entity26 want " in @entity16 the banking sector faces being broken up unless it shows a ‘ step change ’ in competition , the head of the @entity206 warned today			0
in a speech to bankers , @entity210 said banks must provide the ‘ right prompts ’ to help customers decide whether or not they should switch account provider			1
the issue of bank account switching was flagged last year by the @entity219 , which made several recommendations designed to make switching accounts more easy for customers			0
mr @entity210 said : ‘ it is not enough to make it easy to switch			0
customers also need the right prompts to exercise their choice of provider			0
‘ in banking markets consumers frequently face difficulties in understanding the true cost of running their account and comparing deals from alternative providers			0
’ he said the sector was at a ‘ turning point ’ with the emergence of new banks such as @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 but said if ‘ real change ’ is not seen , a ‘ radical approach ’ must be considered			2
the @entity206 chief executive said he was prepared to hand the sector over to the @entity247 and warned the industry could face the same outcome as airports operator @entity251 - a forced break - up			2
as uncertainty lingers , investors are reassessing their assumption that @entity6 will get the money , prompting big market movements today			0
while the euro slipped by 0.5 per cent to below $ 1.30 , stocks across @entity33 fell , with @entity260 's main market underperforming its peers , trading down 1.9 per cent			2
meanwhile , the yield on @entity260 's ten - year bond has risen by 0.18 percentage points to 5.81 per cent while @entity35 's rate has risen another 0.07 percentage points to 5.46 per cent , a little down from earlier			1
@entity260 is a particular worry because it is the eurozone 's third - largest economy and its debt mountain stands at around 1.9trillion euros , way more than anything @entity33 has committed to its bailout facilities			1
though the rates of both countries are still down from the end of last year - when lack of confidence in @entity260 's ability to pay its debt saw its yields bust the 7 per cent mark while @entity35 hovered around 6.67 per cent - the increases have triggered concerns that @entity33 's debt crisis is a long way from being solved			1
the pressure on the two countries had eased in recent weeks , primarily because the @entity288 offered unlimited amounts of super-cheap long - term loans to banks			1
the mood was further darkened after a leading ratings agency threatened more than 100 lenders with downgrades in a sign that the single currency crisis is infecting the banking system			2
@entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 were among 122 financial institutions to have their ratings placed under review by @entity42			1
shares in the banks fell more than one per cent			2
a homeless man sleeps rough beneath a graffiti - covered wall in a train station in @entity16 today @entity311 , markets analyst at @entity313 , said : ‘ the language between those writing the cheques and those cashing them is becoming increasingly critical and untrusting			2
this bailout deal is by no means assured , there are just so many details missing and time and tempers are running short			0
’ @entity325 , chief executive of @entity326 , said : ‘ you ’d be forgiven for thinking that parts of @entity33 were gearing up for a war after the comments that have been made flung around the continent in recent days ... ' the lack of trust from the likes of @entity26 , @entity335 and other countries that @entity6 will not actually implement the agreed austerity measures is fuelling a loathing amongst the @entity6 , especially against the @entity26			0
' the bail - out funds are still not guaranteed and this is rattling markets this morning			2
