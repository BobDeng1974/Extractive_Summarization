if he had lived , @entity0 would be 84 today			2
perhaps , enjoying the golden years of his life with a wife , children and grandchildren			0
instead , the black boy was just 14 and under 100 pounds when he was propped up on an electric chair with a phone book and executed for a pair of murders he probably did n't commit in 1944			2
on wednesday , seventy years too late , a @entity11 judge threw out @entity13 's conviction on the basis that he had been wronged by the justice system , which pushed to arrest , convict and execute him in just a three - month period			1
the ruling gave relief to @entity13 's brother , sisters and civil rights activists who have been fighting to get his case reviewed for years			2
stolen life : @entity0 ( pictured ) became the youngest person executed in the 20th century when he was electrocuted in 1944 for the deaths of two girls in @entity29 , @entity11			1
a judge on wednesday overturned the ruling on the basis that @entity13 's civil rights had been violated by the justice system admission : @entity13 confessed to killing 11 - year - old @entity36 ( pictured ) and 7 - year - old @entity38 , after the 14 - year - old was separated from his parents and interrogated by police			1
judge @entity41 says it 's likely the confession was coerced @entity13 was living with his family in the segregated mill town of @entity29 , @entity11 when he was arrested in connection to the murders of two white girls , 11 - year - old @entity36 and 7 - year - old @entity38			1
the girls disappeared on march 23 , 1944 when they went for a bike ride together in search of wildflowers			0
the girls ' bodies were found the next morning in a shallow ditch behind a church , butchered to death with a railroad spike , their skulls crushed in			2
@entity13 was arrested after witnesses said they saw him picking flowers with the girls			1
he admitted to the crime after being separated from his parents and interrogated by police			0
after that , the justice system moved at lightening speed as he was tried in just one day and found guilty by an all - male , all - white jury who deliberated for less than 10 minutes			1
@entity13 was denied appeal and just three months after the girls ' bodies were found , he became the youngest person in the twentieth century to be executed			1
the 95 - pound teen was so small he had to be propped up on a phone book on the electric chair , and one of the electrodes was too big for his leg			0
@entity11 circuit court judge @entity41 reviewed his case this year , and issued her ruling to overturn it on wednesday			1
@entity81 says she did judge the case based on the facts , since too many documents were lost , but on how the justice system treated the young boy			0
she says she had to overturn the ruling because @entity13 was not properly defended by his attorney , the confession was likely coerced and there was a lack of witnesses or physical evidence			2
' from time to time we are called to look back to examine our still - recent history and correct injustice where possible , ' @entity81 wrote			0
' i can think of no greater injustice than a violation of one 's constitutional rights , which has been proven to me in this case by a preponderance of the evidence standard			0
' family grief : some of @entity13 's surviving family members were in the court room when the judgement was announced on wednesday			1
on the left , @entity13 's sisters @entity111 ( left ) and @entity112 ( right ) in court last january @entity81 also pointed out the fact that the court never tried to get the case moved to another location , where the jury would not have had an emotional connection to the two girls who died			1
finally , @entity81 said that executing the boy for the crime , even though he was the minimum age for criminal responsibility in the state , constituted cruel and unusual punishment			0
some of @entity13 's surviving family members were in court on wednesday to hear the monumental ruling			1
@entity13 's two sisters and brother testified earlier this year in the course of the trial			1
in a 2009 affidavit , @entity13 's sisters said that they spent the day with their brother when the girls went missing , making it impossible for him to have carried out the crime			2
@entity13 is seen second from the right in this pictured published in a newspaper in 1944 , entering @entity11 's death house at a state prison in @entity145 ' they took my brother away and i never saw my mother laugh again , ' @entity13 's sister @entity111 , 78 , previously said			1
' i would love his name to be cleared			0
' while the ruling is especially important for @entity13 's family , it is also a major breakthrough for the @entity160 - @entity159 community at large , many of whom believe the @entity159 justice system continues to hold a race bias			1
@entity163 , who is producing a film called 83 days based on the @entity13 trial , says the decision makes a ' great statement ' to the country as cities across the nation have recently been embroiled in protests over the police killings of black men @entity173 and @entity175			2
both were killed by white police officers , but grand juries in both @entity179 and @entity180 failed to indict the cops responsible			0
' it ’s never too late for justice , ' @entity175 told @entity184			0
' there ’s no statute of limitations on justice			0
one of the things i can say about @entity11 and i can give them credit for — is that they got it right this time			0
during a period of time in our nation where we seem to have such a great racial divide , you have a southern state that has decided to admit they made a mistake and correct it			0
