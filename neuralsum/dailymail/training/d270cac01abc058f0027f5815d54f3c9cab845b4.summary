@entity0 quits at eleventh hour after decades of fame and fortune , they are used to the finer things in life			1
but that has n't deterred a crop of older contestants from deciding to rough it in the jungle in i 'm a celebrity ... @entity13 ! the line - up for the new series is dominated by ageing stars , with four of the ten contestants in their 60s			1
well dressed for the jungle : @entity20 arrives in @entity21 this week ahead of her appearance on i 'm a celebrity			1

here i go ! comedian @entity26 , 69 , looked excited as he jetted out of @entity38 with the average age of this year 's contestants at 47 , show insiders admitted that executives had realised viewers like older celebrities because they bring more ' charisma , jokes and life experience '			1
but they insisted that this year 's show was cast purely on ' character ' and filling it with older celebrities had not been a deliberate tactic			1

as recently as monday @entity76 's ex was insisting to @entity78 bosses that she would go through with show despite her phobia of creepie - crawlies , @entity74 alleges			2
but despite attempting to ' train herself ' to handle snakes and insects , her morbid fear became too much			2
@entity0 's spokesperson told the paper : ' she would have been hilarious but her phobias cause panic attacks			1
' get me out of here ! @entity0 was due to fly to @entity33 this week but has pulled out over her phobia of creepie - crawlies causing panic attacks and in the past , older contestants on i 'm a celebrity have grabbed the most headlines , with @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 among the more memorable stars			1
a source on the @entity78 programme said : ' we do n't cast on age , we choose people based on character and personality regardless of how old they are			2
' but often people that have lived a bit bring a bit more in charisma , jokes and life experience			2
we are happy with the mix of people we have got			2
' eye candy : @entity116 arrives at @entity117 for i 'm a celebrity ... @entity13 ! many of the contestants , including @entity28 , @entity26 and miss @entity121 , have already landed in @entity33 to prepare for filming			2

i 'm a celebrity is that challenge			0
' ' i tried to look up various bootcamps to tackle this year , but life always gets in the way			0
at one point , i even thought about learning to ride a motorbike , so i researched motorbike courses in @entity134 â€“ but it was getting towards the end of the year and i had n't signed up for anything yet when i heard from the producers			0
' looking forward to it ? the only way is @entity142 star @entity141 and actress @entity25 are also on board @entity28 said : ' i 'm really looking forward to experiencing @entity33			0
