all political leaders feel the need to lay bare the details of their private lives			1
but @entity4 may have taken it too far , with a tv interview in which he discusses his love of skinny - dipping in the icy waters of the @entity10 as a boy			1
the 51 - year - old also discussed his battle with testicular cancer , keeping his children out of the public eye and how he plans to go on and on as @entity18 leader - until 2030			1
instead he was interview by the @entity36 programme 's @entity23 on the seafront at @entity21 , where he grew up			1
mr @entity4 revealed that as a schoolboy he ' always questioned authority ' he described his childhood of ' youthful excess ' but gave few details			1
asked if he had enjoyed some lively nights out in the clubs of the @entity22 town , he replied : ' oh gosh , absolutely no comment haha			2
' asked if his high jinks included the sea , he confess : ' well i did a bit of skinny dipping and a few things like that in the middle of the night , yes			2
it got very cold , erm			2
it does need some parameters and some boundaries ; i probably had fewer than most			2
' as a boy he enjoyed more ' freedom ' than children today			1
' kids were allowed out you know with sandwiches and a bottle of water and a bike and off you went and did things for the day			2
' he would go out and collect things , including ' pot lids and bottles and old clay pipes and all sorts of things '			2
he admitted : ' as i got older and into my teens i got more and more difficult			2
i guess a bit of a wind up merchant really			0
' this schoolboy trait has now become part of his political persona			1
' well , being in the @entity87 was an extension of being in school and questioning authority , yes			0
look you know to have a healthy vibrant democracy you need people that question authority			0
' in the programme , to be broadcast tonight , mr @entity4 also discussed the impact of his father leaving home when he was just five			1
' well these things happen , he got over it and made a success of his life			0
we had some problems when i was a kid but not that bad , ' he said			0
mr @entity4 resisted the temptation to let the @entity24 cameras into this home , perhaps after @entity32 's problems with his second kitchen he reflected on his own mortality when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer in his early twenties			1
' i was very emotional about it			0
well my memory is that i was 21 years old and i had testicular cancer and one of my thoughts through that period was that perhaps i wo n’t be able to have children , then having children , first child was a very big moment			1
i was very emotional about it			0
' i ’ve been very lucky			0
i 've got four - two boys , two girls , they 're fit and healthy			0
you 're not going to see pictures because i ’m keeping them out of the public view			0
but they are all doing well in life and i am pleased about that			0
' he discussed how he says prayers ' sometimes ' , most recently for his family after they became trapped in a pub surrounded by a gang of protesters			0
' the only prayers i would ever say actually would be which after last sunday ( when his family were scared by protesters during a sunday lunch ) perhaps is more appropriate you know would be for my family , to be well and to be happy and be strong and i do sometimes think that what i am doing is making their lives a bit difficult			0
' as a hobby , mr @entity4 would go out and collect things , including ' pot lids and bottles and old clay pipes and all sorts of things ' he said that being @entity18 leader did not necessarily prepare him for the level of interest , and opposition in recent months			1
' well you see if i got into the @entity164 , one of the big parties and became an mp and was on a career path , perhaps you could have anticipated longer term what some of the costs might have been , because this was you know a little rabble army that suddenly became quite a big political party , so it 's , some of it has come as a bit of a surprise yeah			1
' but he insisted he has no plans to quit , despite suggesting in earlier interviews that he would stand down if he does not win the target seat of @entity185 on may 7			1
' i have decided i will stand down before the 2030 general election , ' he said with a laugh			1
' i have barely started			0
