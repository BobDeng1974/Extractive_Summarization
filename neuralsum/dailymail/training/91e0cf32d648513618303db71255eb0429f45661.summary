a nine - ton block of sandstone found on a @entity4 mountain late last year holds the biggest fossil trove ever found of the giant predatory dinosaur known as utahraptor , researchers have said			1
scientists have found the remains of six dinosaurs in the rock so far , and more may be trapped there			1
covered in feathers , with a huge sickle claw on each second toe , the @entity14 looked similar to the @entity20 star dinosaur @entity18 , experts say			1
the remains were excavated in a massive effort that has spanned more than a decade , led by @entity4 state paleontologist @entity29 , according to @entity30			1
the recent finds include never - before - seen bones that are already changing scientific views of the @entity14 anatomy			1
' we 're really going to have a different view of this guy , ' @entity29 says			2
part of the emerging picture is that while young @entity14 dinosaurs were lightly built and turkey size , @entity29 explains , the adults were heavily muscled , ' @entity41 ' versions			0
by chipping off smaller pieces of the block , @entity29 and his team uncovered bones from a 16 - foot - long adult , four juveniles , and a baby that would have been only about three feet long from snout to tail			1
if the dinosaurs died together , they might provide some long - sought evidence of group hunting , the researchers hope			1
the @entity14 was the largest of a group of lightly - built carnivores , called the dromaeosaurs ( ' swift lizards ' )			1
it had large eyes , long grasping hands and powerfully clawed feet			2
clearly it was carnivorous , but was distinctive in relying on a wickedly hooked , slashing claw on each foot rather than the jaws and teeth of a typical predator			2
its toe joints were specially enlarged so that its massive claw could be raised upward and backward to avoid damage while running			0
the dromaeosaur group also included velociraptor , made famous by @entity77 in ' @entity20 '			1
last year a dry wash full of 112 - million - year - old dinosaur tracks that include an ankylosaurus , dromaeosaurus and the @entity14 was unveiled			2
there are more than 200 tracks in an area smaller than a football field from 10 different ancient animals that lived during the early @entity88 period			0
they were first discovered in 2009 by a resident			0
the dromaeosaur group also included velociraptor , made famous by @entity77 in ' @entity20 '			1
the tracks include a set of 17 consecutive footprints left by @entity97 ancestor and the imprint of an ancient crocodile pushing off into the water			0
there are footprints from duckbilled dinosaurs , prehistoric birds , long - necked plant eaters and a dromaeosaur similar to a velociraptor or @entity4 raptor that had long , sharp claws			1
the foot of a dinosaur similar to @entity14 , making a track that was preserved at a track site north of @entity114 , @entity4			1
since then , paleontologists led by a team at the @entity117 at @entity118 have studied them and prepared them for display , according to @entity4 @entity123 paleontologist @entity122			1
the tracks include a set of 17 consecutive footprints left by @entity97 ancestor and the imprint of an ancient crocodile pushing off into the water			0
the site is one of the largest areas of dinosaur tracks from the early @entity88 period known to exist in @entity135 , she said			0
' we do n't usually get this , ' said @entity122 , a paleontologist for 16 years			2
' it is a beautiful track site , one of the best ones i 've ever seen			0
' there are footprints from duckbilled dinosaurs , prehistoric birds , long - necked plant eaters and a dromaeosaur similar to a velociraptor or @entity4 raptor that had long , sharp claws			1
in one rock formation , a footprint left behind by a large plant eater is right in the middle of prints from a meat - eating theropod , @entity122 said			2
the imprint of an ancient crocodile shows the chest , body , tail and one foot			2
paleontologists believe it was made while the crocodile was pushing off a muddy bank into water			0
paleontologists believe the tracks were made over several days in what was a shallow lake			0
they likely became covered by sediment that filled them up quickly enough to preserve them but gently enough not to scour them out , @entity122 said			0
over time , as more sediment built up , they became rock			0
they are near a fault line , where the land has moved up and down over the years , she said			0
rains slowly eroded away layers of the rock , exposing the footprints			0
this undated photo provided by the @entity123 shows theropod tracks found north of @entity114 , @entity4			1
these tracks were left by large , three - toed , meat - eating dinosaurs , closely related to the new dinosaur @entity186			2
earlier this year , a @entity4 man was arrested and slapped with the federal charge after authorities say he pried a piece of sandstone with a three - toed ancient dinosaur track from the @entity194 near @entity114			1
he pleaded guilty while accepting a deal that calls for him to serve one year of probation with six months under house arrest			0
paleontologist @entity198 of the @entity117 at @entity118 has taken the lead in studying , cleaning and preparing the tracks			0
their uniqueness has lured paleontologists from several countries , including from @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 , @entity122 said			0
' it 's such an important site that they are coming here to study it , ' she said			0
researchers and volunteers clean the surface of a new track site on @entity123 lands north of @entity114 , @entity4			1
a dry wash full of 112 - million - year - old dinosaur tracks are set to be opened to the public this fall .			2
