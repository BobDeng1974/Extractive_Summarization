it might make up more than 80 per cent of the known universe , but as of yet scientists have still not managed to directly observe one of the universe ’s greatest mysteries - dark matter			2
in recent months there have been detections from the sun and in orbit around @entity10 , but now scientists think they have found it in neighbouring galaxies			0
they spotted photon emissions coming from space - and one of the best possible explanations is that they came from particles of dark matter			2
they analysed x-ray signals emitted by the @entity30 galaxy cluster and the @entity31			1
the signal could not be attributed to any regular form of matter two groups have recently announced that they have detected a signal that could be a sign of dark matter , with the research to be published next week in @entity39			1
one of them , which included @entity23 - based @entity22 scientists dr @entity43 and dr @entity44 , found it by analysing x-rays emitted by two celestial objects - the @entity30 galaxy cluster and the @entity31			1
when physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars , they are confronted with a mystery			0
if they only take visible matter into account , their equations simply do n't add up : the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational @entity61 is something missing			0
from this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light , but does , as a whole , interact by means of the gravitational force			0
called ' dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the universe			2
after having collected thousands of signals from the @entity78 's @entity77 telescope and eliminated all those coming from known particles and atoms , they detected an anomaly that , even considering the possibility of instrument or measurement error , caught their attention			0
the signal appears in the x-ray spectrum as a weak , abnormal photon emission that could not be attributed to any known form of matter			2
above all , ‘ the signal 's distribution within the galaxy corresponds exactly to what we were expecting with dark matter , that is , concentrated and intense in the centre of objects and weaker and diffuse on the edges , ’ explained dr @entity43			1
‘ with the goal of verifying our findings , we then looked at data from our own galaxy , the @entity107 , and made the same observations , ’ added dr @entity44			0
the discovery was made using @entity78 's @entity77 telescope ( illustration shown )			0
the researchers detected an anomaly that , even considering the possibility of instrument or measurement error , caught their attention - as it could be the best sign of dark matter yet the signal comes from a very rare event in the universe : a photon emitted due to the destruction of a hypothetical particle , possibly a ‘ sterile neutrino ’			1
if the discovery is confirmed , it will open up new avenues of research in particle physics			0
‘ it could usher in a new era in astronomy , ’ said dr @entity43			1
and dr @entity44 said : ‘ confirmation of this discovery may lead to construction of new telescopes specially designed for studying the signals from dark matter particles			1
‘ we will know where to look in order to trace dark structures in space and will be able to reconstruct how the universe has formed			0
’ the research , to be published in @entity39 , included @entity144 scientists dr @entity43 and dr @entity44			2
they found the signal by analysing x-rays emitted by two celestial objects - the @entity30 galaxy cluster and the @entity31 ( shown )			1

research led by @entity22 in the @entity23 has found particles in other galaxies that could be dark matter
they analysed x-ray signals emitted by the @entity30 galaxy cluster and the @entity31 galaxy
the signal could not be attributed to any regular form of matter
instead it must be a particle of dark matter , according to the researchers
‘ it could usher in a new era in astronomy , ’ said dr @entity43
