by @entity0 published : 09:58 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 9 july 2013 disgraced former governor @entity1 choked back tears tuesday morning as he opened up about his decision to re-enter the public sphere			1
@entity1 , who resigned from office five years ago after it was revealed that he solicited prostitutes , is now running for the @entity9 comptroller 's office , and he has spent much of the past 24 hours since he announced his candidacy apologizing to voters			1
during an appearance on today 's @entity13 , @entity1 said he has reflected and grown since his fall from grace			2
' you go through that pain , you change , ' @entity1 said , getting visibly choked up			1
watch the video here emotional moment : @entity1 's voice rattled slightly when he talked about the pain he and his family have gone through over the past five years after he resigned as governor of @entity9 @entity1 announced that he would be running for the position - effectively the city 's financial manager - late sunday and made his first public appearance on monday where he was swarmed by a mob of journalists			1
he gave several interviews on monday , but his first truly emotional moment came at the end of his @entity13 appearance			2
' i failed , i had flaws , made horrific judgements , was unfaithful to my family , to the electorate - that 's why i resigned			2
i stood up and i said i 'm holding myself accountable , ' he said during the segment			0
' in those five years , i 've reflected , i have thought , i 've taught , i 've written , i 've done a multitude of things - run our family business - and i now think after five years - a lengthy period of time - and i can go to the public and say " look at the totality of who i am			1
" ' back in the public eye : before he resigned , @entity1 was known as the ' sheriff of @entity51 ' because of his tough stance against banks and the role of @entity56 comptroller would have him dealing with them extensively though he opened the interview saying he was ' mystified ' by the press attention that his involvement with prostitutes , much of the interview was dedicated to questions of whether @entity9 could trust him again after he admitted to breaking a number of laws			1
' i am ready to take the incoming missiles , some of them are hitting - i understand that			0
i 've spent five years thinking , apologizing			1
i 'm ready to ask for forgiveness			0
it 's not easy , i 'm ready to ask , ' he said			0
women of his past : @entity75 ( left ) is the prostitute who met with @entity1 , and @entity76 ( right ) was allegedly the madam who arranged the trysts and she now says she will run against him for comptroller support : his wife @entity80 stood by his side when he announced that he would resign in 2008 following the scandal out and about : @entity80 was not spotted alongside her husband on monday but she has attended a number of @entity9 charity and society functions lately he said that one of the toughest parts of the resignation was looking his ' family in the eye ' and though he did not address them specifically this morning , he previously said that he discussed the run with his wife @entity80 and their three daughters before launching his bid			1
some critics said that the show of emotion seemed contrived - and noted that there were no actual tears - but co-host @entity103 sided with the former governor			1
' he was raw and all there			0
do n’t know if it ’ll change things for him , but i do appreciate a person who ’s made mistakes coming and facing the cameras and facing the questions			0
that ’s actually a test of character , ' she told @entity119			0
his choice to appear on @entity13 , the daily political and economic news show aired on @entity123 , as opposed to a local news program may not help him in his immediate agenda			0
in order to actually qualify for the position , @entity1 must collect 4,000 signatures by thursday in order to qualify for the race			0
his direct competition is @entity133 president @entity132 , a @entity134 who was initially expected to run for mayor but opted for the more financially - focused role			0
taking the insults : the former governor was met with some shouts from hecklers when he went to @entity141 on monday in his first public appearance since announcing his bid while he has the attention of the media , his first real goal is to connect with voters as he has to gather at least 4,000 signatures by thursday from residents who support his campaign in order to run			2

the former governor now hopes to become the @entity9 comptroller
says that he went through ' a lot of pain ' after his prostitution scandal forced him to resign five years ago
