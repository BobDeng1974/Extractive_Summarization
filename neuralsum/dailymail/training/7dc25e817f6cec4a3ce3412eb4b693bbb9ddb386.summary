by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 , right , suspected her son @entity3 , 14 weeks , had picked up her milk allergy a mother who took her baby to doctors claiming he had a milk allergy was dismissed as an anxious first - time parent was days before he was taken to hospital when he started to choke			1
@entity2 was brushed off when she tried to tell her gp that her three - week - old boy had an allergy to cow 's milk , despite him being covered in rash and having swollen eyes			1
but when little @entity18 began to choke and was rushed to hospital by ambulance it was only then that a paediatrician finally diagnosed an allergy , as well as reflux			1
miss @entity2 , 31 , from @entity24 , @entity25 , has now launched a campaign to see gps better trained in spotting allergies in babies			1
miss @entity2 , who also suffers from a milk allergy , said : ' @entity3 was covered in a rash and he had swollen , watery eyes and he was really congested			1
' he was squirming in pain all the time - i knew what was wrong but nobody would listen			2
' the mum took @entity3 , now 16 weeks , to see a doctor at @entity39 in @entity24 but was deemed anxious and nervous			2
his symptoms only improved after his later diagnosis by a paediatrician at @entity43 , when he was started on a milk - free diet and medication for reflux			0
a lead gp at @entity48 said : ' even with a thriving baby such as @entity3 , reflux or feeding problems can be distressing and it sometimes takes a while to get the right treatment			2
' we are glad that after all the appointments and visits he is doing so much better			0
we would be very happy to speak directly to @entity3 's mum about this			0
' dr @entity61 , consultant paediatrician at @entity62 , said : ' as part of their general paediatric education and training , paediatric doctors at our hospitals are trained in spotting the symptoms of milk allergies and reflux , along with all other common conditions found in babies and children			1
' miss @entity2 ' online petition aims to review the system doctors take dealing with babies with potential allergies or reflux , and has so far gathered 3,700 signatures			1
the petition can be signed at http://epetition.direct.gov.uk/petitions/68614			0
some babies can develop an intolerance to cow 's milk			0
it is the most common form of food allergy in small children but most will have grown out of it by the time they go to school			2
babies with an intolerance react to an enzyme in the milk with various degrees of severity			0
in extreme cases the allergy can cause anaphylaxis			0
in most cases , babies develop diarrhoea , vomiting and stomach cramps			0
they can also suffer from eczema			0
@entity3 , left , was covered in a rash and was suffering from swollen eyes according to his mother @entity108 miss @entity2 took @entity3 to @entity43 in @entity24 where he was diagnosed with a milk allergy			1

@entity2 was *concerned* when her son @entity3 suffered a reaction
three - week - old @entity3 developed a painful rash and suffered swollen eyes
miss @entity2 *believed* the *tot* had developed some form of milk allergy
her gp tried to *reassure* her she was ' being an anxious first - time parent '
but when she brought @entity3 to hospital he was diagnosed very *quickly*
now miss @entity2 wants gps better trained to diagnose milk allergies
