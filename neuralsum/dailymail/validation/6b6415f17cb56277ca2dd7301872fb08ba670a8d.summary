@entity0 says he would be happy to switch to full - back for @entity2 , revealing he grew up playing the role in rugby union			1
the former @entity6 and @entity7 stand - off won the @entity8 in 2011 for his brilliant displays with the number six on his back but an injury crisis has left the @entity13 without three specialist full - backs for saturday 's game against @entity16 in @entity17			1
coach @entity18 has called up youngster @entity19 in the absence of @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 but admits he is considering moving @entity24 into the full - back spot			1
@entity0 , pictured in action for @entity7 in 2013 , could be set to play at full - back for @entity2 ' i 'll play wherever , ' @entity0 said			1
' i grew up playing full - back in rugby union , so i 'm not unfamiliar with it			1
' obviously i 've not played there for a while but , if i do get put there , i will have to adjust			2
' obviously when we 're attacking it does n't bother me but defensively you 've got to make sure you 're in the right spots			0
i 've got to make sure my communication is right if i 'm back there			2
' @entity24 stepped into the full - back role towards the end of last saturday 's game against @entity43 after @entity22 went off with a pulled hamstring and @entity18 believes he could perform the role from the start against the @entity16			1
' @entity0 is a versatile player , ' @entity18 said			1
' he can play a little bit of nine if he has to , he can play in the halves , he can play at full - back			1
he 's a natural footballer and he generally creates opportunities wherever he plays on the field			0
' and he 's very much a team player , he wants to do what 's best for the team			0
the most important thing is @entity0 being on the field			1
it 's trying to get the balance right within the team			0
' wherever he plays on saturday , @entity24 's duel with the @entity16 ' @entity62 playmaker @entity61 promises is a mouthwatering prospect , although the player himself is playing it down			2
' i 'm not bothered if it 's @entity61 or if it 's someone else , ' @entity0 said			2
' i 'm not worried about him and i 'm sure he 's not worried about me			0
at the end of the day , i 'll just focus on my own game			0
' @entity24 was in masterful form as he steered @entity2 to their first win of the season against @entity43 but he admits they will be to take a step up against a @entity16 team who are near invincible at the @entity78			1
' it was a good win in the end , ' @entity0 said			2
' we had to dig deep for each other and hopefully we can take some confidence from that			0
we need to build again			0
' it is tough going there			0
they'are an aggressive side and , when they 're at home , they grow even more with their support			0
' i think the squad they have is the best they 've had since i 've been here so i 'm looking forward to that			0
