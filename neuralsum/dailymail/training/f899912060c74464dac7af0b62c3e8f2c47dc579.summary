the @entity1 militia which today took a second major city in @entity3 and is turning its eyes south towards the capital @entity6 is so ruthless and extreme that even @entity7 has cut ties and distances itself from them			2
the @entity10 ( @entity10 , also known as @entity10 ) , used to be part of the international terror network , but was cast out in february this year in light of its violent behaviour towards rival jihadist groups			1
it is famed - and feared - for spreading hardline @entity10 law to the areas it subdues			0
transgressors are sentenced to death and swiftly executed in public , their bodies left to decay in the streets			0
marauding : @entity10 militants are seen above , allegedly outside the city of @entity28 , which fell today to their forces extreme : the fighters were once part of @entity7 , which has cut ties with the group			1
they have now taken control of @entity37 's home town tensions : the @entity10 fighters are from the @entity41 branch of @entity42 - as was @entity37 - in contrast to the current @entity45 government this treatment has even been doled out against other jihadist leaders , who have been assassinated in a brutal struggle over strategy in the @entity50			1
young jihadists are increasingly drawn to @entity10 over less extreme groups - particularly in the light of their rapid military progress through @entity3			2
in the past two days the group has overrun the northern city of @entity57 , and today also took @entity28 , the hometown of executed @entity58 ruler @entity37			1
in february , the leader of @entity7 issued a statement dissociating itself from @entity10 , which it accused of ' forbidden bloodshed ' directed at fellow fighters			1
@entity64 , @entity7 's chief , cut ties after @entity10 attempted to bolster its strength by merging with other rebels in @entity68			1
punishment : two men in @entity71 , @entity68 , were crucified this april for allegedly killing an @entity10 fighter brutal : the images , which could not be independently verified , appear to demonstrate @entity10 's uncompromising brand of hardline @entity1 justice he said : ' we were n't informed about its creation , nor counselled			1
nor are we satisfied with it : rather we ordered it to stop ... nor is al â€“ @entity7 responsible for its actions and behaviour			2
' the organisation is led by @entity86 , who has a @entity88 bounty of $ 10million on his head , second only to @entity64			1
the @entity10 leader , who was born in 1971 in @entity6 , is touted as a battlefield commander and tactician			0
violent and mysterious : this undated photograph is one of only a few in existence showing @entity86 , the head of @entity10 @entity86 , who has a degree in @entity10 studies , apparently joined the insurgency that erupted in @entity3 soon after the 2003 @entity88 - led invasion			1
he was taken as a prisoner of the @entity88 in @entity102 between 2005 and 2007 - it was here that one of the only two photos know to be in existence was taken of him			2
he is known as ' @entity108 ' to members of the @entity111 - ite militia @entity110			0
the secretive @entity112 talks with a scarf covering his face even when dealing with close allies , according to militants who worked with him in @entity3			0
he addresses his @entity10 followers through audio recordings posted to the internet , rather than in public places			0
military sources have reported his death on numerous occasions in the past years , but the fighter always seems to reappear			0
this has led to speculation that @entity112 is in fact a name used jointly by several commanders			0
some estimates claim @entity132 has in excess of 10,000 fighting men in its ranks			0
many of its fighters are thought to be radicalised @entity139 who have poured in from @entity140 and @entity141 to join the fighting in @entity68 and elsewhere			0
the group , which controls large areas of land in @entity68 , is thought to be pouring resources and money from those areas into its burgeoning @entity58 campaign , which has seen it tear through the northern regions on the country			1
its military progress , largely unhindered by @entity3 's own security forces , have given it control over several highly valuable oil fields , which leaders will hope to exploit to strengthen their hand			1
carnage : @entity10 fighters devastated @entity57 , to the north of the country , on monday			1
pictured is a member of the @entity58 security forced gunned down by the militants strewn : uniforms though to belong to @entity58 soldiers were seen scattered on the road in @entity3 's second city - in this smartphone image from the conflict the situation has alarmed officials in @entity175 , who called an emergency meeting of @entity178 ambassadors after 80 of its citizens were taken hostage by @entity10			1
' @entity175 briefed the other allies on the situation in ( the @entity58 city of ) @entity57 and the hostage - taking of @entity175 citizens , including the consul general , ' a @entity178 official said			1
he said the meeting was held for informational purposes and not under @entity191 of @entity178 's founding treaty , which permits a member of the 28 - nation alliance to ask for consultations with other allies when it feels its security is threatened			0

separately , 28 truck drivers who were delivering diesel to a power plant were captured on monday			0

senior sources in the @entity58 government have said that they have a plan to take back @entity57 , but were unclear on the details			2
@entity10 is pushing to expand its territory , which currently straddles the border between @entity68 and @entity3 , and includes land extremely close to the @entity175 border			2
the group 's centre of power is @entity71 , a city in northern @entity68 , which is being run under the regime 's oppressive and violent code			1
