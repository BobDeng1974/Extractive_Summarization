by @entity1 reporter adults are being urged to improve their maths as experts claim poor numeracy costs the economy more than £ 20billion a year			1
inability to cope with numbers results in lower wages , smaller company profits and reduced tax revenues for the government , a charity warns today			1
millions of adults struggle with simple tasks they need in their jobs or everyday life , such as weighing ingredients , administering medicines and working out deals in shops , @entity13 says			1
now , the organisation is urging @entity24 to take a 20 - minute maths quiz after figures showed half the adult population has the numeracy ability of a primary school child			1
they will be given a score and guided towards maths tuition to help them improve their result next time they take the challenge			2
the government - backed scheme is aimed at boosting the maths skills of at least one million adults over the next five years			1
it coincided with new research from the @entity44 charity which pinpointed levels of poor numeracy and calculated the cost to the economy			2
@entity49 , an economist with the charity , said : ‘ the report begins with the finding that almost half the adult population has numeracy no greater than that expected of a child leaving primary school			0
for a developed country that ’s pretty shocking			0
’ poor maths skills were estimated to be costing the economy £ 20.2billion - a - year - 1.3 per cent of gdp			1
in fact , this was likely to be an underestimate since costs to the criminal justice system and @entity66 were difficult to quantify			0
a separate poll of 2,300 adults found that more than a third - 36 per cent - felt they were being held back by their poor maths abilities , for example struggling to help with their children ’s homework or trying to work out budgets and personal finances			1
one in four said maths at school did not prepare them well for maths in everyday life			0
a poll of 2,300 adults found that more than a third - 36 per cent - felt they were being held back by their poor maths abilities ( library image ) under the new initiative , anyone can check their maths skills through a new online quiz at @entity87			1
it takes 20 to 25 minutes and participants will be given a score out of 100 and one of four grades , with gold the top grade , meaning they are performing at gcse c - grade level or above			2
silver is equivalent to grades d to @entity99 at @entity100 , bronze is equivalent to the standard expected of a nine to 11 - year - old , while ‘ entry ’ is the standard expected of children up to the age of eight			0
participants are then guided to free websites which will help them improve their skills at their own pace , before encouraging them to retake the test			0
@entity113 , chief executive of @entity13 , said : ‘ we want this to be the biggest ever drive across the @entity24 to crack the problem of poor adult numeracy , a problem that has dogged us for decades			1
‘ we ’re heartened by the extent to which we ’ve got support from the @entity120 , from @entity121 and @entity122 and the @entity123			0
’ he said poor maths skills were not because @entity24 lacked innate talent but a prevailing assumption that you can either do maths or you ca n’t			1
it was ‘ absolutely vital ’ to explode what amounted to a ‘ big talent myth ’			0
a range of public sector organisations and firms are backing the scheme and encouraging employees to take the quiz , including @entity139 , which described how it would help improve patient care			2
‘ if we can improve numeracy it will inevitably improve care for patients because so much of patient care is measured , ’ said @entity141 , assistant director of learning			0
staff needed maths for a range of tasks such as calculating dose and meal portion sizes , translating easily between stones and kilograms when talking about patients ’ weights and calculating the correct concentration of cleaning products to keep bugs under control			2
@entity161 , group finance director at @entity162 , which is backing the initiative , said : ‘ we are confronted every day , through the distribution of financial products through our branch network with conversations with people who clearly are not comfortable [ with numbers ]			0
‘ it is almost impossible to ask people to make buying decisions around financial products without resorting to numbers			0

many struggle with simple *mathematical* tasks , @entity13 found
