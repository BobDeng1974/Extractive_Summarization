@entity3 is facing charges of ' complicity in pimping ' and ' misuse of corporate assets ' - crimes which could see him locked up for a total of 12 years			1

' there @entity3 is said to have tried to get her a visa for her to remain in the @entity6 , ' said a legal source close to the case			1
' this would have huge ramifications on @entity3 's defence as it would prove he was assisting a prostitute in her work - something which is illegal in @entity11			1
' the allegation that an @entity4 chief was trying to get visas for prostitutes would also create a huge scandal			1
' the woman , who has not been named , is said to have documentary evidence , including pictures of her with @entity3			1

all of the women , who are mainly @entity11 and @entity71 from immigrant backgrounds , claim to have had paid sex with him while he was @entity4 chief			1
but @entity3 's lawyer , @entity74 , said his client was ' totally unaware ' that the women were receiving cash			2
legal help : @entity78 , one of @entity3 's three lawyers , enters a @entity10 police station couple : @entity3 is pictured here previously with his wife @entity82			2
she has caused astonishment by staying with her husband , despite him admitting to numerous affairs ' at these parties , people were not necessarily dressed , and i defy you to tell the difference between a naked prostitute and any other naked woman , ' said mr @entity74			0
@entity3 's night in a 10ft by 12ft police cell in @entity10 was his seventh in custody in the past year - but all the rest were spent in the @entity6 where he faced an allegation of attempted rape			2
while in @entity99 complained about having to wear handcuffs , and his humiliation in @entity11 also looked likely to lead to protests from his lawyers			0
alleged victim : @entity106 chambermaid @entity105 his stark cell contained a four inch high foam mattress , a hole - in - the - floor toilet , and an observance window which allowed a police officer to watch him constantly			0

' i have a horror of prostitutes and pimping , ' he said			2

@entity3 , a leading member of the @entity128 who wanted to run for president this year , resigned from the @entity4 last may after being accused of raping @entity105 , a 32 - year - old chambermaid in a @entity106 hotel			2
the @entity6 case collapsed , but when he returned to @entity11 @entity132 , a 32 - year - old writer , accused him of attempting to rape her			0
prosecutors found prima facie evidence of sexual assault , but said the alleged attack - which happened in 2003 - was too old to pursue			0
now @entity3 is at the centre of an entirely separate investigation into the prostitution ring which operated out of @entity10 's upmarket @entity141			2
allegations include that he paid a 30 - year - old escort between € 500 to € 1,000 to sleep with him 11 times , as he ' had sex with escort girls at libertine parties financed by @entity11 businessmen '			1
another prostitute was allegedly given a guided tour of the @entity4 headquarters in @entity32 after an evening in his company			0
hookers are also said to have been flown out to @entity32 to entertain him			0
@entity3 , who is still facing a civil suit from the @entity106 chamber maid , is said to have attended a number of the parties			2
the last one he attended was in @entity32 in may , just before he was accused of attempted rape by ms @entity105			0
prostitution is legal in @entity11 for women over 18 , but acting as a pimp - or somebody who controls prostitutes and makes money out of them - is			0
