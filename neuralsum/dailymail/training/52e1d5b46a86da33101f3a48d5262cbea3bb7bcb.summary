‘ the @entity7 vote represents a dangerous , populist right - wing vote which is swayed by anti-immigrant and @entity65 rhetoric – and nostalgia for a comfortable world that never really existed , ’ it states			0
‘ these are all the hallmarks of pre-fascist movements – which is not to say that @entity7 is fascist , because it is n’t , but to point to the dangers of ignoring them and the issues or attempting to chase them			0
’ general secretary of unite union @entity11 is in the midst of a bitter dispute with @entity16 leader @entity13 over the @entity31 selection battle mr @entity3 adds : ‘ the threat of xenophobic @entity7 remains very real – in common with right - wing populism and indeed fascism , which is growing dangerously across @entity81			1
’ in the strongly - worded section on ‘ anti-fascism ’ , the report deplores the ‘ outpouring of racism ’ over the murder of soldier @entity86 in @entity87 , adding : ‘ far too many , in the thrall of @entity89 , sought to blame @entity90			0
yet rightly , no one blames @entity92 for @entity94 ’s crimes			0

@entity142 will have responsibility for organising 10 contacts with each @entity4 member in the seat 20 months before the election			0
’ the document makes it clear that despite its setback in @entity31 , it remains determined to get as many @entity16 candidates as possible , and in secrecy , if necessary			2
‘ our work in selections is a bit like a swan , all that can be seen is indication of support here or there , while below the water , activity is furious			0
