@entity0 believes it could take some time for @entity3 's 3 - 5 - 2 formation to work at @entity4			1
@entity5 is still waiting for his first @entity7 win as @entity9 boss , having lost the opener against @entity11 and then been held to draws by @entity12 and @entity13			2
their stuttering start to the season , which also includes a 4 - 0 @entity18 defeat to @entity19 , has prompted criticism of @entity5 's preference to play with three at the back , and @entity0 is not sure the formation will work for @entity4 given the players at the @entity26 's disposal			1
difficult start : @entity4 boss @entity3 is yet to win a competitive game this season frustrated figure : defender @entity30 reacts during @entity4 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity13 at @entity32 straight talker : @entity0 ( centre ) believes @entity5 's 3 - 5 - 2 formation will take time to work ' if @entity5 is determined to persist with a back three , this is going to be a long and painful transition for @entity4 , ' the former @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 boss wrote in his @entity46 column			1
' the team may take until november to settle down			0
you ai n't going to win the league if you take that long and you might not make the @entity50 places either			0
' @entity4 have already dropped seven points from a possible nine			0
if you continue with three at the back and the results are not improving players will not be slow in turning round and pointing their fingers at the coach , saying , ' it 's not that i am not playing well , it 's the system '			0
' @entity0 went on to say that he does not think the system , which @entity5 employed so successfully for @entity61 during the @entity62 in @entity63 , will bring out the best in @entity66 record signing @entity67 , a Â£ 59.7million recruit from @entity68 last month			1
new boy : @entity67 could struggle to fit into a 3 - 5 - 2 system , according to @entity71 boss @entity0 kicking out : @entity72 reacts angrily during @entity4 's disappointing 1 - 1 draw with @entity12 last month the @entity74 added : ' @entity67 is too much of a winger to play as a wing - back , so he could play one position inside the widest man in a 3 - 5 - 2			1
' if you play with a back four you can play him wide , as @entity80 did when he made three goals and scored the other in their 4 - 2 win over @entity84 in midweek			2
i do n't read much into international friendlies but that performance showed his talent			0
' @entity4 have the chance to record their first @entity7 victory of the season next sunday when they face @entity92 at @entity93 .			0
