@entity0 relaunched his political career yesterday with a boast that his party could hold the balance of power at the next general election			1
the former first minister announced that he intends to stand for @entity7 by seeking the @entity9 ’s nomination in the constituency of @entity11			1
but he said his @entity13 nationalists could emerge as power brokers if no party wins an overall majority in @entity17			0
he announced the decision at the @entity25 in @entity26 ( pictured ) in return for propping up a @entity29 government , he said another independence referendum is likely to be among the @entity9 ’s top demands			1
claiming there is the ‘ prospect of real power for @entity13 ’ if the @entity9 wins a significant number of @entity35 seats , he warned of turning @entity17 ‘ upside down ’			1
mr @entity0 stood down as @entity9 leader and first minister last month and speculation over his political future has continued ever since			1
today he revealed will stand in the @entity11 constituency , a seat that shares some areas with his @entity46 constituency , and is currently represented by @entity48 sir @entity47 , who is retiring in may			1
mr @entity0 said : ' in the weeks since the referendum the people of @entity13 have refused to give up on the hope of a better @entity13			2
' for those who voted @entity53 the referendum offered the possibility of real change			2
for many who voted no they insist on the vow being properly redeemed			0
' therefore it is incumbent on all of us to step up to the plate – to match the spirit being shown by the people			1
therefore i can tell the constituency today that i am a candidate for the @entity9 nomination for @entity11			1
' some polls have put the @entity9 well ahead in @entity13 , threatening to reduce @entity29 to a rump of just a handful of seats			1
it raising the prospect of the @entity9 holding the balance of power if @entity29 and the @entity73 fail to secure an overall majority			1
but mr @entity0 insisted the @entity9 would not do a deal with the @entity73 in ' any shape or form '			1
' there are other possibilities , and in these possibilities a strong group of @entity81 will have the capacity to rumble up @entity17			0
' mr @entity0 said it was ' unlikely ' he would sit in a @entity85 with @entity29 , but ruled nothing out asked whether he would sit in a @entity85 with @entity29 , mr @entity0 told @entity87 's @entity88 : ' that is unlikely i would have thought but i 'm not ruling it out , i 'm just saying it 's unlikely			0
' i 'm actually the only person who has actually run a minority government in these islands incidentally			2
' i had four years of doing that in the @entity7 so you learn a great deal when you 're on the receiving end of being a minority government and therefore you have some evidence as to how to accept the best possible influence to secure the best possible result for progressive thought across these islands			2
' mr @entity0 also played down the prospect of leading the @entity106 in @entity17			0
he said : ' i have been first minister of scotland			2
i have no interest in titles and fully support @entity110 who is an excellent leader of the @entity9 at @entity17 , a close friend and a fine mp			1
' i am perfectly content as a constituency member of parliament and will seek to have a role in negotiating the progress for @entity13 which would arise from a powerful group of @entity9 mps and our allies			1
@entity120 has replaced mr @entity0 as @entity9 leader and @entity13 first minister mr @entity0 was previously an mp for @entity123 and @entity124 between 1987 and 2010 and will set out his plans in a speech in @entity26 , @entity127 , today			1
since the referendum , support for the @entity9 has swelled and the party 's membership has grown from 25,000 to more than 92,000			1
recent polls have also predicted large gains for the party at next year 's general election , with one showing the @entity9 leading labour by 46 per cent to 26 per cent in @entity13			1
mr @entity0 , who remains an msp , has regularly been asked about his future since stepping down as first minister but has so far refused to confirm his plans			2
the @entity11 seat , which will now become one of the most - watched in next year 's general election , was won by the @entity48 with a majority of 6,748 over the @entity9 in 2010			1
incumbent mp mr @entity47 said : ' people in @entity11 rejected the first minister 's independence plans overwhelmingly at the referendum			1
' i am sure that they would be delighted to have the chance to reject him again in may			0
' @entity48 candidate @entity150 , who hopes to replace the retiring mr @entity47 as the local mp , said the area had been ' short changed ' during mr @entity0 's time as first minister			2
' i 'm delighted the former first minister is set to put an end to the game - playing , ' she said			2
' the people of @entity11 deserve better , just as they deserve an mp who will stand up for what 's important to them , not chase their personal political agenda at the cost of what 's best for the people of the @entity166			1
' i intend to be a strong voice for all the people of @entity11			1
' @entity0 is , in his own head at least , mr @entity13			0
he was so destined for the role he made sure he was born on @entity171 , december 31 , that great night of @entity13 celebration			0
he could only have been more pleased if he had shared a birthday with @entity174			0
but then @entity0 is a man who is often pleased with himself			0
clubbable to his fans , smug to his critics , there are many who will have delighted at his demise today			0
at @entity0 's press conference to announce his resignation as first minister , journalists from unfriendly newspapers were locked out of the room in @entity186 yet his abilities to charm his supporters and outfox his opponents transformed @entity13 politics			2
it is a mark of the man that at the press conference to announce his resignation as first minister hours after his referendum defeat , journalists from unfriendly newspapers were locked out of the room in @entity186			1
the referendum campaign was dominated by claims he sought to bully or intimidate those who did not share his enthusiasm for breaking up the @entity201			2
you were either on his side or against him , as the @entity87 's @entity204 discovered when he dared to question the details of his plans for independence			2
critics were dismissed as scaremongers			0
facts dismissed as lies , experts flatly ignored			0
that was how he ran things , spending 20 of the last 24 years as @entity9 leader			1
when he took charge in 1990 , the @entity217 had just three mps in @entity17			0
there was no such thing as a @entity7			0
now there are six mps in @entity17 , an unprecedented overall majority in @entity46 , and having secured an historic referendum on independence			1
he said he wanted to put the future of @entity13 in the hands of the @entity13 people			0
they took his dream of separation and tore it to shreds			0
but he is a man who refuses to take no for an answer			0
born in @entity238 in 1954 , @entity0 was educated at @entity239 and @entity240 , where he first joined the @entity9			1
graduating with a degree in economics and history , he worked as an economist for both the @entity245 and the @entity246 before being elected as an mp for the @entity123 and @entity124 constituency in 1987			2
in 1981 he married @entity248 , 17 years his senior they have no children , and she is rarely seen in public , though she was on hand to smuggle a @entity255 past @entity254 security in her handbag for @entity0 to wave when @entity257 was crowned champion in 2013			0
mr @entity0 , who will turn 60 on @entity259 , said he had decided to ' step up to the plate ' in the interests of @entity13 his election at @entity17 followed a turbulent period for the @entity9 , which saw its number of seats fall from 11 to two in the 1979 general election			1
as a young and brash newcomer , @entity0 played a role in the breakaway faction of the party known as the ' @entity271 ' which sought to take a more left - wing stance			0
his brief expulsion as a result did not hinder his advancement within the party in the long - term , with his election to leader coming in 1990			2
with the creation of the @entity7 in 1999 , @entity0 went on to serve as leader of the opposition at @entity46 , while retaining his seat at @entity17			0
he stood down as @entity9 leader in 2000 and left the @entity7 in 2001			1
returning as leader in 2004 , he guided the @entity9 to a narrow @entity13 election win in 2007 and then led a minority government as he became @entity13 's first @entity9 first minister			1
with the @entity73 all - but wiped out in @entity13 , and @entity29 's big beasts serving in @entity289 's @entity85 in @entity17 , few could match @entity0 's abilities			0
while @entity29 viewed @entity46 as a small pond compared to the shark - infested waters of @entity17 , @entity0 was the biggest fish north of the border			0
he rebranded the @entity295 as the @entity295 , greeting @entity296 in @entity297 like a visiting dignitary , not the prime minister of the @entity300			2
after the 2011 elections , he bounced @entity17 into accepting his claim to have a democratic mandate for a referendum			0
a year later he bounced @entity296 into accepting the timing of the referendum , and giving 16 and 17 - year - olds the vote			0
a @entity308 fan , a keen golfer , an enthusiastic gambler , @entity0 has a competitive streak to almost everything , even dieting			0
when trying to slim on the 5:2 diet , he boasted how he had shed the pounds faster than chancellor @entity313			0
he will turn 60 on @entity171 this year , and his frequent jokes about his age on the campaign trail hinted at a private unease at this looming milestone			0
yet even as he stood down as first minister , he made clear voters had not seen the back of him			1
' i am not going to withdraw entirely from public life , ' he said			0
now we know he will stand to become an mp in @entity11 , certain to lead the @entity9 group in the @entity35			1
the man who likes to challenge the history books could be about to write another new chapter .			0

former first minister to stand for election in @entity11 constituency
decision comes after he stood down in wake of independence referendum
insisted he would ' step up to the plate ' for the 2015 general election
but rules out the @entity9 working with a @entity345 government
