the steamy new @entity0 commercial , launched yesterday , is making women worldwide swoon thanks to model @entity4 's blue eyes , toned abs and chiselled features			1
but alas , the 32 - year - old , who is seen stripping off his shirt after being soaked with a can of the fizzy drink - much to the delight of a watching group of women , has revealed that it is his wife who is his biggest fan			1
the @entity16 model told @entity17 this morning : ' she loves it			0
it 's been on replay a lot			0
i travel a lot so it 's her way of having me at home when i 'm away			0
on being chosen to star in the ad , @entity4 said : ' i 'm just a lucky guy … right place , right time			2
i 'm just happy to be a part of it			0
' happily married : @entity4 may be the @entity0 hunk , but he 's also husband to @entity43 , and father of two the six - foot - one - inch model has starred in campaigns for @entity47 , @entity48 ( with supermodel @entity49 ) , @entity50 and most recently , @entity51			1
he lives with his wife , @entity43 , and two children in a farm house in @entity55 near @entity56 ; moving back from @entity57 after their daughter , @entity58 , was born two years ago , he told @entity61 magazine			0
the couple own a pet store called the @entity64 , a store that is ' at the heart of the community and aims to work with the various local charities in re-homing unwanted animals , ' says its website			0
the ad , titled @entity71 , seems far removed from @entity73 's humble life , beginning with group of female friends sipping @entity0 over lunch in a park and watching the handsome landscape gardener mowing the grass			1
one of the girls has an idea and sets a @entity0 can rolling down the hill - timing it perfectly so its path intercepts @entity4			1
he picks it up and opens it , only to be soaked by a jet of @entity0 , and smiling , removes his t - shirt before returning to his mowing			1
the @entity56 model added : ' everyone remembers the @entity92 advertisements			0
dog lovers : wife @entity43 ( pictured ) , who owns the pet store @entity95 with @entity4 , says they have great ' passion for our own pets - three very large @entity97 and a rather special white moggie ' ' they have been cultural milestones and i ’m absolutely thrilled to have been chosen to play the part in 2013 - especially in such an exciting year for the brand			1
' the new ad , which launched yesterday to celebrate @entity0 's 30th birthday , will also see @entity107 , the handsome star of the 1998 ad , make a triumphant return to the small screen			1
@entity4 , who has shot to fame overnight and has been looking to get into acting , said : ' the reaction 's been great			2
it 's only been out a while , but there 's definitely been a lot of hype towards it			0
it 's been a great thing			0
' first aired in 1994 , the original @entity0 break starred @entity123 as a hunky construction worker who kept a group of admiring women in an office glued to their window every day at 11.30am when he paused for a can of @entity0			2
what 's this ? in his role as the gardener , @entity4 picks up a can of @entity0 rolled down the hill towards him oops ! he opens it only to be sprayed with frothed up fizz			1
next up : the good bit ... topless : soaking wet , the hunk is forced to remove his shirt revealing a perfect six pack in the process that 's more like it ! the watching women ( and womankind everywhere ) react with delight the innovative campaign became a cultural phenomenon , and evolved with fresh incarnations in 1997 and 2007			2
@entity107 , who now stars in 90210 , @entity152 and @entity153 , says : ' i still do have a love affair with @entity0			2
she 's been good to me for all these years			0
' ' women got excited when they saw the @entity160 commercials			0
' ' being objectified by women is a pretty good feeling if you ask me , and i felt like a rock star			0
life is short and the commercial was harmless			0
' @entity0 launched in 1982 and twelve years later , released the original ' @entity169 ' advert featuring @entity171 model and actor @entity123			2
the 1994 ad sees @entity173 as a handsome construction worker on a building site , keeping a group of admiring women in an office building glued to their window			0
' construction worker ' @entity123 caught the eye of an entire office of women the 1998 hunk @entity107 kept ladies on time as a sexy window cleaner in 1998 the second @entity169 advert featured @entity107 keeping ladies on time for their 11.30am appointment as an unforgettable window cleaner			2
but in 2007 , @entity0 caused a storm by letting their their hunk keep his top on - much to the disappointment of female fans			1
played by 28 - year - old @entity198 skater and @entity200 graduate @entity199 , the lift engineer comes to rescue three ladies after they get ( intentionally ) stuck in an office lift			1
do try this at home ! @entity4 's character strips off after being soaked with frothed up @entity0 the latest version of the iconic advertising campaign stars hunky @entity16 model , @entity4 , as a gardener who gets into a spot of bother with a shaken up can of @entity0			1
with @entity0 spraying everywhere and soaking his shirt , the hunk is forced to remove it - much to the delight of a watching group of ladies			1
