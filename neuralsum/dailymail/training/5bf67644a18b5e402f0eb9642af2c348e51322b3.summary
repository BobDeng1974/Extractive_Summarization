by @entity0 published : 14:28 est , 29 march 2012 updated : 14:28 est , 29 march 2012 @entity1 is no longer the world 's biggest publicly traded producer of oil			1
for the first time , that distinction belongs to a 13 - year - old @entity8 company called @entity9			1
the @entity11 company was created by the @entity8 government to secure more oil for that nation 's booming economy			1
@entity9 announced thursday that it pumped 2.4 million barrels a day last year , surpassing @entity1 by 100,000			1
the company has grown rapidly over the last decade by squeezing more from @entity8 's aging oil fields and outspending @entity19 companies to acquire more petroleum reserves in places like @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
it 's motivated by a need to lock up as much oil as possible			1
@entity9 announced thursday that it pumped 2.4 million barrels a day last year , surpassing @entity1 by 100,000 @entity9 's output increased 3.3 percent in 2011 while @entity1 's fell 5 percent the company 's output increased 3.3 percent in 2011 while @entity1 's fell 5 percent			1
@entity1 's oil production also fell behind @entity32 , the @entity33 energy company			1
@entity9 's rise highlights a fundamental difference in how the largest petroleum companies plan to supply the world as new deposits become tougher to find and more expensive to produce			1
every major oil company has aggressively pursued new finds to replace their current wells			2
but analysts say @entity19 oil firms like @entity1 have been more conservative than the @entity8 , mindful of their bottom line and investor returns			1
with oil prices up 19 percent in 2011 , they still made money without increasing production			1
analysts say @entity19 oil firms like @entity1 have been more conservative than the @entity8 @entity50 has a different mission			1
the @entity8 government owns 86 percent of its stock and the nation uses nearly every drop of oil @entity9 pumps			1
its appetite for gasoline and other petroleum products is projected to double between 2010 and 2035			0
" there 's a lot of anxiety in @entity8 about the energy question , " says energy historian @entity61			0
" it 's just growing so fast			0
" while @entity9 sits atop other publicly traded companies in oil production , it falls well short of national oil companies like @entity72 , which produces nearly 8 million barrels a day			1
20111 : @entity50 ( @entity8 ) 2 : @entity32 ( @entity33 ) 3 : @entity1 ( @entity73 ) 4 : @entity74 ( @entity75 ) 5 : @entity76 ( @entity77 ) 20101 : @entity1 ( @entity73 ) 2 : @entity76 ( @entity77 ) 3 : @entity50 ( @entity8 ) 4 : @entity32 ( @entity33 ) 5 : @entity74 ( @entity75 ) and @entity1 is still the biggest publicly traded energy company when counting combined output of oil and natural gas			1
@entity9 ranks third behind @entity1 and @entity76 in total output of oil and natural gas			1
@entity9 is looking to build on its momentum in 2012			1
" we must push ahead , " @entity9 chairman @entity84 said in january			2
@entity9 has grown by pumping everything it can from reserves in @entity8 , estimated to contain more than 6.5 billion barrels			1
it drilled thousands of oil wells across vast stretches of the nation 's northern grasslands			2
some of those fields are ancient by industry standards , dating close to the beginning of @entity8 's communist government in the 1950s			0
the commitment to aging fields distinguishes @entity9 from its biggest @entity19 rivals			2
@entity1 and other major oil companies typically sell their aging , low - performing fields , or they put them out of commission			1
@entity9 also has been on a buying spree , acquiring new reserves in @entity23 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity24 and @entity22			2
since 2010 , its acquisitions have totaled $ 7 billion , about twice as much as @entity1 , according to data provider @entity110			2
several other @entity8 companies have become deal makers around the globe as well			0
total acquisitions by @entity8 energy firms jumped from less than $ 2 billion between 2002 and 2003 to nearly $ 48 billion in 2009 and 2010 , according to the @entity116			0
more times than not , the companies are paying above the industry average to get those deals done			0
it 's making some in the @entity122 nervous			0
in 2005 , for example , @entity123 , a company mostly owned by the @entity8 government tried to buy @entity73 oil producer @entity126			0
@entity73 lawmakers worked to block the deal , asking president @entity129 to investigate the role the @entity8 central government played in the process			0
@entity133 eventually bought @entity126 for $ 17.3 billion			0
" there 's a resistance to @entity8 investment in ( @entity73 ) oil and gas , " @entity135 analyst @entity134 says			2
" it 's like how @entity142 was to us in the 1980s			0
people think they 're going to take us over			0
they 're going to buy all of our resources			0
" @entity9 has been on a buying spree			2
since 2010 , its acquisitions have totaled $ 7 billion , about twice as much as @entity1 that 's unlikely to happen			1
it does n't make economic sense to export oil away from the world 's largest oil consumer			2
but the @entity8 could make it tougher for @entity154 to generate returns for their shareholders			0
@entity8 's oil companies have been willing to outspend everyone and that drives up the price of fields and makes it more expensive for everyone to expand			2
" you now have to outbid them , " says @entity165 analyst @entity164			0
" if you ca n't , you 're going to have access to fewer assets			0
" longer term , @entity8 expansion globally will bring benefits to the @entity73 and other economies			0
by developing as many oil wells as possible — especially in @entity108 , @entity23 and other politically unstable regions — @entity8 will help expand supply			0
" frankly , the more risk - hungry producers there are , the more oil will be on the market , and the cheaper prices are , " says @entity177 , an energy policy expert at the @entity179			0
despite its swift expansion , @entity9 and other @entity8 companies still have much to prove to investors , analysts say			2
@entity9 's parent , @entity191 , for example , has spent millions of dollars in @entity192 to provide highways , medical facilities and shuttle buses for the elderly			1
oil companies typically do n't do that			0
all of that increases the cost of business and minimizes the returns for shareholders			0
in 2009 and 2010 , @entity9 's profit margins for its exploration and production business were only about two - thirds that of @entity1 's			1
its stock price has climbed less than 1 percent , in the past year , compared with a 3.7 percent rise in the stock of @entity1 " you have to ask yourself : what is the purpose of @entity9 ? " @entity134 says			1
" it is to fuel @entity8			0
although they 're a public company , i 'm very skeptical that they have any interest in shareholder value creation			0

@entity9 surpases @entity1 oil production by 100,000 barrels
@entity226 's output increased 3.3 **%** in 2011 while @entity1 's fell 5 percent **%**
