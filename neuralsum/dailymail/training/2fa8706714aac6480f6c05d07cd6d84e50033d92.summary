@entity0 is in line for a recall to the @entity4 team to partner his brother @entity5 when they take on the @entity6 in the biggest team match the country has hosted for decades			1
the 28 - year - old doubles specialist , who has already won a title on the @entity11 this season , is in pole position to make his first appearance since 2011 when @entity15 hosts the @entity17 first round tie in early march			1
while talking up the prospects of pitting the @entity20 against the world champion @entity22 , gb captain @entity18 also ruled out any prospect of @entity24 being selected on tuesday , regardless of his current citizenship application			0
@entity5 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) @entity0 share a joke while playing together in @entity15 five years ago the two brothers also played together during the @entity28 in 2012 the 25 - year - old @entity29 , who reached the final of the @entity11 event in @entity32 at the weekend , wants to represent his adopted country and hopes that a nationality switch is imminent			1
but @entity18 made it clear on tuesday that he is set on having @entity37 @entity36 as his back up singles player , and is more concerned with who will make up his doubles team for what could well be the pivotal rubber of the tie			2
he has five realistic options for the doubles team : the @entity0 brothers , @entity4 stalwart @entity47 , former @entity49 champion @entity48 and recent @entity52 number one @entity50			1
tellingly , though , he pointed to @entity0 's decent record against the @entity54 when discussing his thoughts for @entity57 's opening tie in the elite sixteen - team knockout			2
@entity59 ( left ) and @entity60 ( right ) celebrate winning the @entity61 earlier this month ' it 's very difficult for anyone to play three matches in three days at this level , but without disrespecting anyone the strongest doubles team is @entity5 and somebody else , ' said @entity18 , in attendance at the @entity70			1
' i 've got some very good options but i 'd say @entity0 has been the strongest player over the last six months , and he has done well in recent matches against the @entity54 ( two wins alongside @entity75 @entity60 in their last four meetings )			1
' he acknowledged that @entity47 has played well in the @entity4 previously , but he is sitting out at the @entity70 after the birth of his first child and is likely to be short of matches			2
@entity18 witnessed wins in the qualifying event for both @entity82 and @entity83 , an event that @entity36 does not need to play in because his ranking of 102 has secured a place in the main draw			0
@entity88 trains with a heart monitor around his chest ahead of the @entity70 in @entity91 ' @entity92 has always fought 100 per cent for @entity57 in the @entity4 and is improving all the time			1
' @entity24 is a good guy but he 's ranked lower than @entity36 and i do n't see him as an issue for me to consider at the moment			0
' @entity96 is ranked 116 but highly rated , and he believes he could soon be a @entity52 citizen			0
however , even if he comes to represent @entity98 as an individual he would have to launch an appeal process to overcome rules hindering him from playing in major team competitions			0
one of @entity83 , 21 , or @entity82 , 20 , are likely to be the reserve player at the @entity4			2
@entity83 defeated @entity105 6 - 4 6 - 3 in the qualifying first round while @entity82 overcame @entity108 's @entity107 6 - 4 6 - 2			0
@entity18 said that he would like to have been able to consider former @entity52 number two @entity109 , who has not played since the summer after knee problems			0
he revealed that @entity109 is likely to make his comeback at a futures level event starting in @entity114 this weekend .			0

the @entity117 brothers are in line to play alongside one another for @entity57 when the @entity4 gets *underway* in early march
@entity0 has been in impressive form over the last six months , most recently winning the @entity123 *international* doubles title with @entity60
brother @entity5 has been seeded sixth for the @entity70
