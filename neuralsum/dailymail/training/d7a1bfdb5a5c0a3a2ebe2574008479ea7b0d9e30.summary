tranquilised , strapped down and shut inside reinforced trucks , a group of rare elephants has been saved from what campaigners say would be certain death			2
the endangered @entity7 forest elephants had torn up farms and crops in villages in @entity11 , triggering fears that farmers would shoot them			1
so an animal rights charity has saved the creatures the only way possible - by driving them 250 miles away to a national park			0
the creatures have been forced from their habitats onto farms by logging and mining tranquilised : workers from the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) had to bring a crane and a giant box in which the elephants wake up - along with two litres of washing up liquid to help move them thankless tusk : forest elephants are prized by poachers as the illegal ivory trade booms in countries like @entity40 pests : forced out of their habitat , the creatures had torn up farms near @entity45 , which has 170,000 people unusual cargo : locals were fascinated , and just like in the rest of the world , they filmed it on their phones the mission by the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) was no easy task , as the dense forests of the elephants ' habitat made them almost impossible to track			1
just 100,000 or so of the creatures are left in the wild after logging and mining forced them from their habitats and into conflict with farmers			1
unlike larger savannah elephants , they live only in the jungles of central and western @entity7 , torn up by wars and heavy industry			2
despite weighing up to five tonnes they are not even safe in national parks , as poachers seize on the booming trade of illegal ivory to countries like @entity40			0
to save the elephants yesterday experts tracked them through jungle near the town of @entity45 , then shot them with tranquiliser darts			1
rescue mission : the charity hopes to save about a dozen elephants in total which have settled near @entity45 team member @entity87 said : ' you are dealing with a dangerous animal			2
those elephants are silent and you can literally take a corner and walk into one of those and that 's where injuries and deaths will occur from ' wide load : locals help the rescuers lift the elephant weighing up to five tonnes onto their truck using a crane elusive : the elephants hide in forest canopies 60 metres high , and seeing one at close quarters is rare operation : a truck transports another of the rescued elephants yesterday , halting traffic on a busy country road rescue : once captured , the elephants are driven 250 miles away to the @entity117 they had to bring chainsaws and pickaxes to hack through the trees - and two litres of washing - up liquid to slide the sleeping elephants onto a trailer			1
then there was the huge crane which lifted the beasts onto a car recovery truck			0
team member dr @entity129 said : ' there 's no way we can perform a traditional elephant caputre here like we do in the savannah			0
mission : usually the rescuers use helicopters , but were thwarted by the dense @entity7 jungle ' the primary forest canopy is 60 metres high			1
it makes it impossible to operate with the helicopter			0
it 's going to be a mammoth task			0
his colleague @entity87 added : ' you are dealing with a dangerous animal			0
those elephants are silent and you can literally take a corner and walk into one of those and that 's where injuries and deaths will occur from			2
' in all the charity hopes to rescue about a dozen elephants , which experts will rehome in the @entity117 and fit with @entity163 collars to track their movements			1
the @entity11 government pleaded for the charity 's help to avoid the elephants being killed			1
@entity29 director @entity169 said : ' the elephant is the national emblem of @entity11			1
this is why , at the request of the @entity11 authorities , the villagers have shown patience so that a humane alternative to culling could be found			2
' having examined all of the available solutions , we proposed this last resort to move the elephants to safety			2
' ' if we are to save these endangered elephants , we have to act now , during the dry season			0
this jumbo rescue mission resolves a major conservation problem and contributes to the safety and well - being of both animals and people			0
' the number of forest elephants is impossible to determine exactly because the creatures are so reclusive			1
instead scientists have to count the amount of dung in each area			0
it is not the first time the charity has run a jumbo evacuation , however			0
in 2009 , @entity29 evacuated 83 savannah elephants which were caught in deadly human - elephant conflict in @entity206			1
you can donate towards the mission here			0
easy does it : the last stage before the elephants can be moved involves easing them into a giant steel trailer once they reach their destination , the elephants will be able to wake up in the boxes as the drugs wear off @entity29 director @entity169 said : ' if we are to save these endangered elephants , we have to act now , during the dry season			1
' the charity is appealing for donations to help with the mission from the public			0

animals forced out by logging have *clashed* with farmers in @entity11
now they have been rescued by the @entity29
experts had to hack through jungle with chainsaws and avoid being gored
there are only about 100,000 forest elephants left in the wild
