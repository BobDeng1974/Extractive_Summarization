by @entity0 @entity1 left @entity2 for @entity3 as a young widow with three children before she was hired as housekeeper at the @entity7			1
an intimate witness to history , she also has been much of a mystery			0
that was until this year , when a woman with a distinctive @entity14 lilt to her voice called @entity16			0
the housekeeper , the woman said , was related to her late husband , and she had in her possession a necklace that @entity22 first lady @entity21 gave @entity1			1
housekeeper : @entity1 is seen in an undated photo provided by the @entity16			2
she served at the @entity7 in @entity26 , @entity27 as housekeeper for @entity29 and his first lady , @entity21 ' what really took my breath away is she said she had a photograph of @entity1 , ' said @entity35 , curator at the @entity36 , formerly the @entity7			1
' considering that it 's been almost 150 years since she left the @entity7 that anyone has been able to look at her face is just remarkable , ' @entity37 said in an interview			2
the tintype adds a human dimension to what is a tantalizing but frustrating portrait of a woman who left her children in @entity49 to oversee the @entity7 in the capital of the @entity22 during the duration of the @entity52 but publicly revealed little of the experience			1
@entity1 was among a staff of 20 , was a confidante to the first lady , and may have been in the mansion in april 1865 when president @entity58 visited after @entity22 defenders left the city smoldering			1
historical records are unclear on that point			0
the discovery is important nonetheless because the museum , which is next door to the @entity7 , has strived to piece together the often untold lives of the @entity68 - @entity3 slaves , free people of color and @entity71 immigrants who worked as domestics for the @entity29 family			1
' one of the more elusive figures was @entity1 , ' @entity37 said			0
@entity1 was a central character in this @entity78 version of ' @entity79 ' and she remains a bit of an enigma			0
even her name is a mystery			0
it 's been spelled various ways through the years â€” @entity1 , @entity86 and @entity87			2
this much is known : she was born @entity89 on april 7 , 1822 , in @entity90 , in western @entity2			0
she was educated in a convent , and apparently the fine needlework the religious order of nuns taught her may have influenced her hiring by @entity21			0
she married a ship captain , @entity96 , but was widowed at age 25 when he was lost at sea			0
while the circumstances of her journey to @entity3 are not known , @entity1 settled in @entity49 in about 1850			2
in 1861 , she left her children with relatives and headed to visit friends in @entity26 , where she was marooned when @entity27 left the @entity104			1
told by friends @entity21 could help her return north , she appealed to the @entity107 bishop to intercede on her behalf			1
first lady : @entity110 , wife of @entity29 , is seen in an 1860 photo provided by the @entity16			0
@entity1 served as a confidante to mrs @entity21			2
an intimate witness to history , @entity1 also has been much of a mystery ultimately , @entity29 prevailed upon @entity1 to take the position as housekeeper and companion to the first lady despite @entity1 's separation from her children			1
@entity1 would eventually remain at the @entity22 @entity7 until @entity26 's fall in 1865			1
despite her perch within the @entity22 seat of power , @entity1 left little written accounts of her years in @entity26			1
she left it to others to speculate on her employment , including a reporter who wrote after her death of all the ' exciting conferences ' she would have witnessed			0
when the first family left @entity26 in april 1865 , @entity1 remained to oversee the mansion			1
writing from @entity134 days after his departure , president @entity29 wrote to his wife : ' mrs. @entity137 behaved just as you described her , but seemed anxious to serve and promised to take care of everything which may mean some things			0
' perhaps a more telling gesture of @entity1 's connection to the first family of the @entity22 was her correspondence with the @entity144 after they parted and a wedding she and @entity21 attended in 1867			1
they were the only white people in attendance at the wedding of @entity151 , who had served in the @entity7			0
when @entity29 died in 1889 , @entity1 attended a memorial in @entity49			2
a reporter said she ' attracted considerable attention ' and was described as ' a well - preserved old lady			0
' @entity37 said @entity1 's story resonates particularly with her because she calls herself the ' modern housekeeper of the @entity7			1
' ' i 'm supposed to be over there keeping it clean and maintaining it so i 've always felt a personal affinity for her , ' she said			0
after her service at the @entity7 , @entity1 returned to @entity49 where she operated boarding houses until her death in 1907 .			2
