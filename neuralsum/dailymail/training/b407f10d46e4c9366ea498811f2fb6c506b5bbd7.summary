by @entity0 published : 07:49 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 10:29 est , 7 november 2012 the parents of a four - year - old girl raped by a teenage babysitter who was never sent to jail for his crime are in despair after their appeal against his paltry sentence was blocked			1
the unnamed mother and father had demanded a tougher sentence for the 14 - year - old who tricked their little girl into being abused when he was meant to be looking after her			0
during the sickening attack he blindfolded their daughter with a @entity21 apron and promised her a ' chocolate ' but then raped her			1
the teenager walked free from @entity24 earlier this year and still lives a few doors away from the child he abused			2
devastating : the young girl , who was raped by a 14 - year - old boy ( pictured being held by her parents ) - whose appeal to get the attacker 's sentence changed has failed the victim ’s parents understood he would receive a three - year custodial sentence – but he was let off with a community order instead after a judge blamed ' the world and society ' for his porn addiction			1
judge @entity41 sparked outrage by deciding he should not go to prison , instead giving the rapist a three - year community order			1
the girl 's devastated parents claimed the judge 's comments had ' cheapened ' their daughter 's ordeal and said they would appeal			1
spared jail : judge @entity41 ( pictured ) warned the boy that he would have been jailed for six and a half years if he had been four years older - but blamed ' the world and society ' for his porn addiction but the attorney general has now confirmed the appeal will not be allowed to go ahead because the case was ' difficult to sentence '			1
it concluded that the @entity59 would not regard the sentence as ' unduly lenient ' and the case will not progress further			2
the victim 's mother - who can not be named for legal reasons - said they are ' angry ' and ' disappointed '			0
she said : ' it is coming up the anniversary of the attack we do n't wish to drag it all up again			0
' now the decision has been made , we can not appeal , we are now going to move on with our lives			0
' it is disappointing , but as ever our priority is our little girl and her happiness - we just have to move on			0
' we want to keep her life normal , we do n't want to reinforce the memory and we want her to remain as content as she is now			0
' we hope it does n't effect her relationships in later life			0
' the abuse took place at the girl 's @entity88 home in december last year - the first time her parents had let the teenager babysit the girl alone			1
they trusted him to watch her for a couple of hours in return for £ 10 pocket money and said he was a quiet but ' normal kid ' who they completely trusted			0
but when they got home the victim 's @entity100 was getting her ready for bed when she revealed the babysitter had played a game , promising to reward her with chocolates			0
she explained how he had covered her eyes with her @entity21 apron and ' put his willy in her mouth '			1
the victim 's tearful mum blasted @entity24 for letting the attacker walk free - when he lives just a matter of doors from their family home			0
professionals who dealt with the sick teen advised the attorney general that the best way of addressing his behaviour was by educating him within the community			1
walking free : the teenage rapist 's addiction to porn led to the judge giving him a community order his progress and whereabouts will continue to be monitored by police for the next two and a half years			1
a sex offences prevention order was also made for five years , stating he must not access or seek to access pornography of any kind and must not use any mobile devices or computer without suitable filters to prevent the viewing of pornography			2
the offender - who at the time of the case appeared in the dock in his school uniform - was told he had only been spared six - and - a - half years in jail because he was still a minor			0
the solicitor general may have concluded against appeal but he did promise that the babysitter 's period of supervision will be ' tough ' and ' challenging ' and will ' force him to address his behaviour '			2
a spokesman for the @entity155 said : ' following complaints from the victim 's family as well as members of the public , the former solicitor general , @entity156 mp asked the @entity162 to send the case papers to him for review			1
' after very careful consideration of all the factors in the case , he decided not to refer it to the @entity59 as he did not believe they would increase the sentence			2
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

the teenager blindfolded her with a @entity21 apron and used chocolate to lure her into the sex attack
he was let off with a community order as the judge blamed *‘* the world and society ’ for his porn addiction
the child 's parents appealed to the attorney general , who says a new hearing will not be allowed because the case was ' difficult to sentence '
