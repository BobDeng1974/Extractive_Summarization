by @entity0 published : 14:42 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 14:42 est , 7 january 2014 tragic : @entity2 , 48 , tried calling mental health services three times in the 11 days before his death the family of a man who threw himself in front of a train after making at least three unanswered calls to the mental health service have been awarded compensation by the @entity13			1
father - of - three @entity2 , 48 , was being treated for occasional bouts of depression			1
two weeks before his death , mr @entity2 , a road safety engineer , rang his gp 's surgery three times to say he was considering taking his own life			2
but his calls for help went unanswered as each time receptionists failed to pass the message on to the mental health services			0
nearly four years after his death at @entity28 in @entity29 in february 2010 , his family have received an undisclosed payout from @entity31 and @entity32			1
the trust accepted that had mr @entity2 been admitted to a psychiatric hospital and given appropriate treatment when he asked for it , his suicide 11 days later would probably have been avoided			2
his widow @entity39 , 48 , from @entity40 in @entity31 , said : ' @entity2 was let down when he needed professional help most			1
' we continue to be amazed that the @entity32 had such a poor referral practice in place given the severity of the types of cases receptionists were expected to handle			0
' as we hear more and more news about cuts to mental health services and budget restraints , what happened to @entity2 only goes to show what a poor state many mental health services in the @entity56 are in			0
' as a family who lost a loving husband and father because of inadequate procedures that jeopardised the safety of vulnerable people is both infuriating and heartbreaking			0
' mrs @entity64 said she hopes the ruling will change attitudes towards mental health in the @entity13 : ' we are pleased to hear that the @entity32 has implemented new procedures to try and prevent any other errors being made but we hope that this will now be rolled out across the @entity56 to ensure no other patient ’s safety is compromised in a similar way			0
' dr @entity74 , medical director of the trust , said : ' services have been improved substantially since mr @entity2 ’s death to reduce the chance of anything similar happening again			1
' the trust ’s senior management is committed to continual improvements in our services and we will work with commissioners to ensure that recommendations continue to be implemented and learning shared			0
