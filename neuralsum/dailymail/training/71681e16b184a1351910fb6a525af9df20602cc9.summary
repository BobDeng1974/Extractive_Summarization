passengers on board a research ship that has been trapped in @entity4 ice since @entity5 are expected to be rescued by helicopter tomorrow after three icebreakers failed to reach the paralysed vessel - but it could still be weeks before they reach dry land			1
a helicopter on board a @entity14 icebreaker , the @entity15 , aims to collect the 52 passengers trapped on the @entity18 ship @entity19 when there is a break in the weather			1
ironically , the @entity23 had gone in search of evidence of the world ’s melting ice caps but instead the team of climate scientists had to abandon their mission because the ice is thicker than usual at this time of year			2
the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) said the rescue would be a complex operation			0

the 22 members of crew will remain on the stricken vessel this image , taken by passenger @entity50 , shows the ship still stuck in the ice off @entity53 , as it waits to be rescued the research team had hoped the @entity56 icebreaker @entity57 ( seen here yesterday ) would be able to crack through the thick ice and allow them to continue on their way the @entity32 said the rescue would be a complex operation - and it could be several weeks before the passengers reach dry land			1
above , @entity23 expedition leader @entity64 gives a briefing about the ice conditions yesterday ' the helicopter is unable to fly in the current weather conditions and will hold off on the rescue until conditions improve , ' @entity32 said in a statement			1
' weather conditions are unlikely to start improving until tomorrow and decisions related to carrying out the rescue may be made at short notice			0
' the 22 members of the crew - who have built an icy helipad - will stay behind with the ship and wait for the ice to break up naturally , expedition spokesman @entity76 said			1
they had hoped the @entity56 icebreaker @entity57 would be able to crack through the thick ice and allow them to continue on their way			1
the ship is n't in danger of sinking , and there are weeks ' worth of supplies on board , but the vessel can not move			2
above , the research team drill into the ice a thin fresh coat of snow on the trapped ship professor @entity97 , leader of the @entity98 , is pictured talking to international media from the top deck of the stranded ship @entity56 @entity103 senator - elect @entity102 up early doing some stretching on the top deck of the @entity19 the @entity105 came within 20km ( 12 miles ) of the ship on monday , but fierce winds and snow forced it to retreat to open water			1
today , the weather remained bleak , and the crew on the @entity105 said their vessel would also be at risk of getting stuck if it made another rescue attempt			2
the @entity15 , which is waiting with the @entity105 at the edge of the ice pack , was also unable to crack through the ice , as was @entity121 's @entity120			2
the passengers will be flown back to the @entity15 in groups of 12 , and then transferred by barge to the @entity105			1
@entity125 , @entity32 emergency response division general manager , said the @entity57 will then take several days to make its way to the @entity127 in @entity53 to refuel before returning to @entity128 in @entity129			1
' it will be a couple of weeks before they are landed , ' he told @entity133			0
the @entity14 icebreaker @entity136 - meaning @entity15 - was deployed to rescue the @entity18 science ship however just before midnight on friday captain @entity139 's ship ( pictured ) also became trapped scientists on board the @entity136 , including @entity142 ( left ) , are now studying the condition of the @entity18 ship while they wait to be freed themselves a photograph sent in by the captain of the @entity18 ship suggests that the two vessels can actually see each other , albeit as a tiny speck on the horizon smile : the crew of passengers and researchers pose for a holiday photograph in the depths of @entity53 @entity157 , a passenger on @entity18 's @entity158 , is pictured watching an adelie penguin it is believed a simple shift in the wind could free the @entity23			1
winds from the east have been pounding the ship and pushing the ice around the vessel			2
a westerly wind would help break up the ice , @entity76 said			0
the trouble is , no one knows when the wind will change			0
the ship is n't in danger of sinking , and there are weeks ' worth of supplies on board , but the vessel can not move			0
the expedition , which set off from @entity182 on november 28 , is being led by @entity97 , a climate scientist , who was hoping to reach the base camp of @entity185 , one of the most famous @entity4 explorers , and repeat observations done by him in 1912 to see what impact climate change had made			1
trapped : 74 people , including scientists , tourists and a @entity194 reporter , are stuck in thick ice sheets crew members routinely check the hull of the ship , which gathers fresh layers of snow every night the looming helicopter rescue means the expedition will have to be cut short , @entity76 said			1
still , those on board appeared to be taking it all in stride			0
' surprisingly , all the passengers seem to be considering it the adventure of a lifetime , ' @entity76 said			0
@entity211 has also posted a photograph on @entity213 apparently showing the @entity14 vessel , a speck on the horizon beyond an expanse of ice			2
' everyone well , ' @entity211 added			0
he said trying to break through ice that was too thick would be ' like driving your car into a brick wall '			0
passengers waved as a helicopter sent from @entity14 's retreated @entity15 flew by to check the snow levels yesterday the researchers on board have managed to get messages out saying they are well - stocked and continuing their research despite being trapped in five metres of ice sheets 1,500 miles south of @entity129 capital @entity128 failed : this picture , tweeted by passenger @entity97 , shows the top - of - the - range icebreaker , @entity14 's ' @entity15 ' which also got stuck and was forced to retreat on friday @entity18 's @entity158 is recreating @entity185 's 100 - year - old @entity236 expedition using new tools blizzards could hamper the rescue mission , but the ship is well - stocked and the scientists are continuing their research on the snow around them and he tweeted : ' heavy ice			1

marooned 1,500 nautical miles south of @entity128 - the capital of the @entity56 state of @entity129 - the thick ice sheets built up during a bout of severe wind			1
the @entity18 embassy in @entity56 has been in constant contact with the captain and said everyone on board was in good health and there was ' no threat to their lives or safety '			0
the ship had been on a multi-day tour from @entity182 to visit several sites along the edge of @entity53 before getting trapped in sea ice on board are scientists from the @entity276 , a journalist from @entity194 and dozens of tourists who have paid to be part of the recreation of @entity185 ’s expedition			2
the research team has made contact with local stations from the @entity285 to say they are well - stocked with food			0
they are also continuing their research while stranded by testing the temperature of the surrounding ice sheets			0
a spokesman for @entity32 said : ' it is quite a remote part of the world , but we have everyone safe			0
the vessel is n't in any immediate danger			0
' @entity121 's @entity298 , also deployed to save the ship , has now turned back bleak : the ship has been stranded in the barren , frozen landscape since @entity5			0

helicopter on @entity14 icebreaker , @entity15 , aims to pick up 52 passengers ; 22 crew members will remain on stricken vessel
passengers will be flown to @entity15 in groups of 12 , and then transferred by barge to the @entity56 back - up ship @entity105
@entity105 will then take several days to make its way to @entity127 in @entity53 to refuel before returning to @entity128
