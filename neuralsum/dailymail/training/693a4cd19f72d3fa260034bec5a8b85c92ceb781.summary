@entity1 's managing director has admitted the state of the pitch at the national stadium is below its usual standard and says it could be march before it is back to its best			1
@entity7 , however , defended the decision to host @entity10 games at the stadium just six days before an @entity13 qualifier , saying the cause of the pitch problems was not the @entity17 matches but too much top - soil being placed on the surface during the summer			1
@entity13 manager @entity20 last week questioned the @entity22 's decision to host @entity10 games at @entity1 so close to national team matches - the @entity13 host @entity24 in a @entity26 qualifier on saturday six days after the @entity27 played the @entity28			1
loose dirt flies flies up at @entity1 as @entity27 ' @entity30 returns the ball against @entity28 getting straight to work the @entity1 groundstaff race to prepare the pitch for @entity13 's clash with @entity24 @entity7 told the @entity22 's website : ' we strive to deliver the best possible surface , so i 'm slightly disappointed that the surface is n't as good as it should be but i 'm confident it will be back to its pristine state after a winter renovation			1
' this is n't so much a problem of the @entity10 but of our summer renovation and i am confident the renovation will get it back to how it 's been ever since we switched over to @entity50 in 2010			0
' however , due to slightly too much topsoil during the summer renovation there 's more marking and scarring on the pitch than we 'd want			0
' the @entity50 surface has artificial fibres woven into the natural grass providing greater durability and since 2010 there have been few of the problems which dogged the @entity1 pitch before then			0
@entity13 boss @entity20 did n't seem extremely			2
pleased with the @entity10 match taking place at @entity1 the @entity1 surface is visibly cut up as the @entity10 stars go through their paces on sunday night groundstaff try their best to remove divots from the pitch at half - time during the @entity10 match @entity20 met @entity7 for talks after his comments last week and the @entity1 chief will meet the @entity13 boss again later this week			1
@entity7 added : ' @entity20 is totally entitled to his opinion			0
we have a very good working relationship with the @entity13 team and we 'll be working closely with them this week to ensure we deliver the best possible playing surface for the game on saturday			0
' i met @entity20 at the end of last week and no doubt we 'll pick up with the team on thursday and friday this week too			2
' while the pitch will not be of the very highest standard we want for the @entity24 game , it will still be a good playing surface			0
we do expect it to be back to its best by march for the @entity95 game			2

@entity1 director blames too much topsoil , not @entity10 , for pitch problems
@entity7 met with @entity20 to *discuss* @entity13 boss 's comments
pitch is expected ' to be back to its best by march for the @entity95 game '
