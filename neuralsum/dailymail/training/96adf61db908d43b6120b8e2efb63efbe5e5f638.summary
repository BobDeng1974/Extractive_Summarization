the full scale of violence and corruption in @entity3 since the fall of @entity5 has been laid bare in an @entity7 report accusing the world of ' turning a blind eye ' to war crimes			1
since the dictator 's death in october 2011 , the then @entity12 - backed rebel groups have split into two rival camps - one based on hardline @entity17 ideology and the other a largely secular faction			1
@entity7 has now accused both groups of ' running amok ' and using armed gangs to torture and murder their rivals , saying the feuding militias have ' committed a wave of abductions targeting civilians based on their origins or perceived political allegiance '			1
the human rights organisation added that the international community is choosing to ignore the ' chaos engulfing @entity3 ' however , saying the option to punish those responsible for potential crimes against humanity is available to the @entity39 , but has simply not been taken up			1
conflict : @entity3 military soldiers fire their weapons during clashes with @entity17 militias in @entity45 yesterday masked : a @entity3 regime solider takes cover during clashes with @entity17 militants in @entity45 yesterday colonel @entity5 died after the @entity51 security council approved bombing raids led by @entity53 , @entity54 and the @entity55 designed to assist rebel militias battling against forces loyal to @entity5 on the ground			1
he was eventually captured and shot dead by the victorious rebels in 2011			0
but threat of extreme violence has remained near - constant presence in @entity3 since the civil war came to an end three years ago , as the once relatively united rebel militias struggle to find common ground on the extent to which religion should play a role in rebuilding the country			2
the deep ideological divisions have led to both sides committing human rights abuses in the subsequent battle for power , @entity7 claims in its latest report			2
detained : a suspected @entity17 militant is arrested by forces loyal to the @entity3 regime in @entity45 a soldier loyal to the @entity3 regime fires at @entity81 using a machine gun mounted on a pick - up truck ' armed groups have tortured - and probably summarily killed - detainees in their custody , and have committed a wave of abductions targeting civilians based on their origins or perceived political allegiance , ' the report explains			1
' likewise , satellite images released today by @entity7 show that fighters on all sides in the conflict have displayed an utter disregard for civilian lives , launching indiscriminate rocket and artillery fire into crowded civilian neighbourhoods , ' the human rights group added			1
@entity7 cited specific accounts from @entity3 caught up in the conflict - particularly in two cities key to the overthrow of @entity5 in 2011 , @entity107 and @entity108			1
while militia in @entity107 are backed by @entity17 groups linked to @entity112 - the organisation accused of the killing of @entity55 ambassador @entity114 , fighters in @entity108 are allied with the fledling @entity3 regime , now based in the city of @entity117			2
fighting : a @entity3 regime soldier fires at @entity81 in @entity45 yesterday			2
only three years ago the groups fought side by side during a civil war that led to the death of dictator @entity5 a soldier loyal to the @entity3 regime loads his gun before setting off to fight @entity81 in @entity45 rebels from @entity107 and other @entity17 - dominated towns seized @entity3 's capital @entity130 in august , finally forcing divisions between the rival groups into open warfare			1
the @entity135 country has had two governments and parliaments since a militia group seized the capital , setting up its own cabinet and assembly			0
since then there have been accusations of tit - for - tat kidnappings in the areas around @entity107 and @entity108 - with detainees from either side saying they have been savagely beaten and tortured			0
@entity7 says photographs of corpses suggest a number of men taken captive were later murdered by the feuding militia , adding that others remain missing and are presumed dead			0
@entity7 's report concludes that not enough is being done by the @entity156 to bring an end to the violence , adding that the option to punish those responsible for potential crimes against humanity is available to the @entity39 , but has simply not been taken up			0
' the international community has largely turned a blind eye to the chaos engulfing @entity3 since the 2011 uprising , ' the report claims			1
a @entity169 spokesman told the @entity170 that @entity53 remains committed to playing its part in @entity3 , and is helping to negotiate an ' essential ' political settlement between the rival groups			0
@entity3 has had two governments and parliaments since an @entity17 militia group seized the capital , @entity130 , setting up its own cabinet and assembly			2
pictured is @entity45 during clashes yesterday western powers worry that the @entity3 is heading towards another civil war as authorities are too weak to control islamists defying the state 's authority in order to grab power and a share of oil revenues this morning @entity3 's internationally - recognised prime minister @entity189 said he was ready for peace talks with @entity17 groups controlling @entity130 , as fresh fighting in @entity45 killed 20 people			0
@entity189 set one condition for talks with his rivals , however			0
' we open the doors of dialogue with our brothers on the condition that there be concessions from all sides , ' he told reporters in @entity206 at the end of a three - day visit to @entity209			0
his comments were more conciliatory than recent statements when he had vowed to liberate @entity130 militarily , a plan analysts say is unrealistic as the weak government forces are no match for better - equipped rebels			0
western powers worry that the @entity3 is heading towards another civil war as authorities are too weak to control islamists defying the state 's authority in order to grab power and a share of oil revenues .			0
