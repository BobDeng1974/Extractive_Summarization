president @entity0 , who is undergoing treatment in @entity2 , lashed out at opponents seeking to oust him from power , but his dramatically changed appearance belied his show of defiance			1
white plaster casts covered his arms and hands , and his face appeared noticeably darker and thinner than before the attack			1
he sported a short beard and his hair was covered with a red - and - white - checkered @entity32 headdress cloth , both unusual for the clean - shaven , suit - wearing leader			2
@entity10 president @entity0 gave a speech from the @entity2 capital @entity38 on july 7 looking weak and thin attack : president @entity0 used his speech to lash out at opponents in a pre-recorded video statement broadcast on thursday , @entity0 said he 'd undergone more than eight ‘ successful operations , ’ but did not say if and when he would return to @entity10			1

however , @entity58 , a protest leader in the @entity10 capital of @entity60 , said @entity0 's career is over			1
‘ it 's clear form the way that he looks that he ca n't come back			2
this man is no longer able to rule the country , ’ said @entity58			0

gathering : president @entity0 's speech , in which he described himself as a defender of democracy , rallied his supporters before his injury , @entity0 repeatedly refused to sign the proposal			1
more than four months of popular uprising seeking to end his rule have battered @entity10 's economy , spread instability and caused the @entity108 to turn away from @entity0 , once considered a key ally in fighting @entity10 's active @entity128 branch			1

@entity160 today said that the @entity108 ambassador 's unauthorised trip to the flashpoint city of @entity164 proves @entity165 has a hand in the troubles			2
the strong statement comes as @entity160 are expected to take to the streets across the country in a weekly show of defiance against president @entity174 's autocratic regime			1
@entity164 , the site of a 1982 massacre by @entity174 's later father and predecessor , has become a focal point of the uprising and has drawn the largest crowds since the revolt began in mid-march			2
backlash : a man wearing sunglasses painted with the colours of the @entity160 national flag gives a v - sign during a rally in support of the @entity160 opposition in @entity191 , @entity192 ‘ the presence of the @entity108 ambassador in @entity164 without obtaining prior permission from the @entity196 as stipulated by instructions distributed repeatedly to all the embassies is clear evidence of the @entity108 involvement in the ongoing events in @entity160 , ’ the state - run news agency @entity193 reported friday , citing an unnamed ‘ official source ’ at the @entity196			0
thousands of @entity205 took to the streets around the country today to demand justice for victims of @entity210 's regime and press the new , military rulers for a clear plan of transition to democracy			2
there is growing frustration among @entity205 that little has changed five months after the 18 - day uprising forced the former president to step down on february 11			2

the @entity108 is trying to ‘ aggravate the situations , which destabilise @entity160 , ’ the statement said			0
the central @entity160 city poses a potential dilemma for @entity174 's government on friday			0
