the last time @entity2 faced @entity3 , he missed a penalty in the biggest game of his career so far as @entity7 lost the 2012 @entity9 final in a shootout at @entity11			1
it took three years for @entity2 to get another chance from the spot – scoring against @entity15 last month to help @entity16 through to the quarter - finals of the @entity18 – and the striker will not be afraid to step up again if @entity16 win a penalty at @entity21 on sunday			1

‘ that was a great final but penalties are a lottery and i missed mine			1
i remember it to this day			0
it ’s still the biggest game i ’ve played in			0
@entity2 misses his penalty for @entity7 during the 2012 @entity9 final against @entity3 it took three years for @entity2 - now at @entity16 - to get another chance from the spot the 26 - year - old sent @entity15 keeper @entity36 the wrong way in the previous round of the @entity18 ‘ i was younger then and i was a bit tired because it was the end of the game after extra-time			1

but it ’s gone , it ’s finished , it ’ s behind me			0
