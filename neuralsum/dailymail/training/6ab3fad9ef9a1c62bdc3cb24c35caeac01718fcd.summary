shadow foreign secretary @entity0 said business leaders have a ' patriotic duty ' make the case for @entity4			1
and he warned that the @entity11 's approach to @entity12 poses ' the biggest risk to @entity15 national prosperity in a generation '			1
@entity17 has promised that if he remains prime minister after the election he will renegotiate @entity15 's @entity7 membership before holding an in - out referendum by 2017			1
he has made clear that without agreement on curbing benefits , he will ' rule nothing out ' – raising the prospect of backing @entity15 's exit from the @entity7 if he does not get his way			1
today @entity5 warned business leaders they must start making the arguments against severing ties with @entity4			2
in a speech to ambassadors from all 28 @entity7 member states , mr @entity0 said pro-eu business leaders should learn the lessons of the @entity38 independence debate			1
many companies delayed expressing a view until the last minute when polls suggest a @entity43 vote could win , but were then seen as playing a crucial role in shaping the final days of the campaign			0
mr @entity0 acknowledged that many business leaders are wary of getting involved in political debates			2
but he added : ' for business to speak up for @entity15 's place in @entity12 is not about party political advantage , it is about recognising both where our country 's national interest and your business interests lies			1
' it is about patriotic duty			1
' leaving the @entity7 would mean ' actively choosing an economy with weaker investment , less trade with the rest of the world , poorer productivity and worse living standards , ' said mr @entity0			1
he claimed mr @entity17 had become ' a much more marginal figure in @entity4 ' , adding : ' @entity68 is on the march , and @entity17 is running			2
' last month the prime minister used his long - awaited immigration speech to insist that curbs on tax credits , child benefits , jobseekers allowance and council housing will be a key demand for his talks on renegotiating @entity15 's @entity7 membership			1
issuing a direct appeal for other @entity12 countries who have seen thousands of their citizens move to the @entity15 to support limiting movement across the continent , he insisted his demands were not ' outlandish ' and @entity15 deserves ' to be heard '			2
and he threatened to block any new countries joining the @entity7 unless controls are imposed to stop their citizens flocking to more successful economies like @entity15			2
but mr @entity0 warned that a @entity11 victory in the 2015 election would mean that within the course of the next @entity94 , @entity15 could be out of @entity12 and thrust into a ' full - blown constitutional crisis '			1
' the truth is that a @entity11 government in 2015 would mean breaking not simply with the record of the last government , it would mean breaking with decades of history that have defined the country we are today , how our country is run , and the place we have in the world , ' he said			0
' that risk is real			0
and so too is the responsibility on business to now find its voice and to make the case with authority and passion , that the right road for @entity15 is not exit from @entity12 but reform within @entity12			1

you know what we have to lose			0
your voice must be heard , because if you wait , it could be too late			0

@entity158 , chief executive of manufacturers ' organisation @entity159 , said : ' manufacturers remain overwhelmingly of the view that our economic well - being and long term strategic interest of this country is dependent on being a full and leading player in the @entity7			2
equally we do recognise that reform of the @entity7 is also a key requirement			0
' we do not want uncertainty on this subject			0
@entity173 , investment and trade are all dependent on a thriving and effective @entity7 , with @entity15 at its heart			2
