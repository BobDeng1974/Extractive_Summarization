@entity0 was accused of being ' up to his neck ' in the @entity3 bank account row today , after revelations that a string of @entity7 donors hoarded money in the country			1
former @entity7 treasurer @entity10 and @entity12 - born car manufacturing heir @entity11 , who has donated six - figure sums to the @entity14 , are among a host of individuals who legally held accounts in @entity3 with @entity19 's private bank , according to a leaked tax disc			1
in a fiery commons debate , the prime minister insisted ' no - one had done more ' than the current government to crack down on tax avoidance			1
' it came before tax officials at @entity32 were hauled before a @entity34 committee this afternoon over its ' pathetic ' failure to tackle tax avoidance			2
chief executive @entity37 was accused of letting people ' get away with it ' , by @entity41 chair @entity40			0
mrs @entity40 said : ' you are not serving the @entity44 taxpayer			0
' but mrs @entity37 responded : ' that is absolutely not the case			0
' @entity32 bosses knew about the @entity19 tax scandal eight months before the bank 's chairman was appointed as a government minister			1
the agency received a copy of the list of clients with millions stashed away in @entity3 before @entity56 of @entity57 was brought in to government in january 2011			2
@entity59 said it ' beggared belief ' that @entity32 would not have reported to the chancellor about problems at the bank when it began investigating the individuals concerned for tax evasion			2
@entity26 accused the prime minister of being ' up to his neck ' in the @entity3 bank account row today 's debate , during prime minister 's questions , became so heated the commons speaker @entity72 was forced to intervene peers named in the @entity19 files include lord @entity75 , the @entity78 shipping and ports entrepreneur who was ennobled by @entity80 , and @entity81 , who was a party treasurer under @entity0 and has given £ 3m to the conservatives			1
@entity85 for @entity86 , @entity87 , alongside his financier brother @entity83 , also held accounts with @entity19 's private @entity3 bank , according to the @entity90			1
but mr @entity87 issued a statement saying : ' i have never had a @entity3 bank account , and do not control any @entity3 bank accounts			1
' i have never sought or been given tax minimisation advice by @entity19 , directly or indirectly			2
the media commentary around this is therefore wrong			0
' the @entity7 have raised over £ 5m from @entity19 clients recorded with @entity3 accounts , while @entity59 has also benefited from cash and gifts in kind worth over £ 500,000 , as well as a loan for £ 2m			1
@entity59 donors who held @entity3 accounts with @entity19 include the steel magnate @entity106 and restaurant owner and clothing entrepreneur @entity108 , who at various times is recorded to have donated to both @entity59 and the @entity7			1
@entity32 was asked to vet @entity56 before his appointment , but only about his personal tax arrangements			0
that was despite a formal investigation by @entity32 into the @entity19 accounts from at least as early as october 2011			2
but @entity115 insisted ministers knew nothing about the client list when mr @entity0 made @entity56 a @entity7 peer and then trade minister			2
the revelation that thousands of ' black ' accounts were used to stash millions and avoid tax has caused outrage			2
bank records were stolen by a whistleblower in 2007 , but did not reach @entity44 until 2010 after a deal between @entity32 and the @entity129 authorities			0
officials say part of the deal was that the taxman could not pass on the details – but they have since been leaked			0
since then only one person has been prosecuted despite £ 135million being recovered			0
speaking in prime minister 's questions today , mr @entity26 accused the prime minister of being too close to wealthy donors with overseas accounts			1
he said : ' let 's take @entity10 , who gave £ 3million to the @entity7			1
he actually appointed him as treasurer of the @entity7 and gave him a peerage for good measure			2
' can he explain what steps he 's going to take about the tax avoidance activities of @entity81			1
' mr @entity0 said : ' when people donate to the @entity7 they do n't pick the candidates , they do n't choose the policies and they do n't elect the leader			2
' when the trade unions donate they pay for the candidates , they pay for the policies and the only reason he is sitting there is because a bunch of trade union leaders decided he was more left - wing than his brother			0
' questions : @entity56 ( left ) was a @entity7 trade minister and @entity161 ( right ) was then @entity32 's head of tax but mr @entity26 said : ' he did n't just take the money			1
he appointed the man who was head of @entity19 as a minister			2
it was in the public domain september 2010 that @entity19 was enabling tax avoidance on an industrial scale – are we seriously expected to believe that when he made @entity56 a minister four months later he had no idea about these revelations			1
' he dismissed the claims as ' fiction ' and said he had clamped down on tax avoidance			2
he said : ' those two in the @entity178 were the friends of the tax dodger			0
we 're the friends of the hard - working taxpayer			0
' mr @entity26 responded : ' he 's bang to rights , just like his donors			1
' the billionaire paedophile friend of prince @entity185 was among @entity19 offshore investors named in the leaked account files			1
the data links @entity189 to several private accounts in @entity191 , including one in his own name which held £ 2.3million			0
@entity189 , above right , who was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting sex with underage girls , was last month accused of employing teenage ' sex slave ' @entity197 , who claimed he made her sleep with prince @entity185 when she was 17			0
@entity200 has denied the @entity185 had ' any form of sexual contact or relationship with @entity197 ' and @entity189 has called her claims ' outlandish and offensive '			0
the disgraced hedge fund manager is one of seven clients of @entity19 's private banking arm in @entity191 known to have donated to the charitable foundation run by former @entity211 president @entity210 and his wife @entity212			1
miss @entity197 , now 31 and a mother of three , has said she met mr @entity210 twice but was never ' lent out ' to him			0
she claimed @entity189 told her : ' he owes me some favours			0
' @entity189 gave $ 25,000 ( £ 16,400 ) to the foundation in july 2006 , the year after he was arrested following a complaint he abused a 14 - year - old , the @entity90 reported			0
another @entity191 client , restaurateur @entity108 , transferred $ 1million to the foundation , seemingly in return for mr @entity210 's attendance at a charity ball in 2005			0
it is not illegal to hold a @entity3 bank account and there is no evidence any of the donors used accounts to avoid tax			1
the foundation keeps a public database of donors and says all donations are vetted carefully			0
furious mps have accused @entity32 of ' failing ' the public by letting wealthy tax avoiders ' get away with ' stashing their cash in @entity3 bank accounts			1
the chair of the @entity41 @entity40 said she was furious at the ' pathetic ' response to leaked @entity19 files showing thousands of @entity44 - based individuals held bank accounts in @entity3			1
she said the tax authorities had failed to serve @entity44 taxpayers ' interests in their response to the leak in 2010			0
chair of the @entity41 @entity40 said she was furious at the ' pathetic ' response to leaked @entity19 files @entity32 permanent secretary @entity37 insisted that @entity32 staff had been ' diligent ' in their approach to the files @entity32 has only secured one prosecution from a list of 6,800 @entity44 - related accounts provided by @entity129 authorities five years ago			1
ms @entity40 said it appeared that activities related to the @entity191 branch of @entity19 's @entity3 subsidiary were ' pretty outrageous ' and told @entity32 permanent secretary @entity37 that taxmen should have spoken to whistleblower @entity265 , who initially obtained the list while employed as an it worker in 2007			1
ms @entity37 insisted that @entity32 staff had been ' diligent ' in their approach to the files , and said their record of securing one conviction and £ 135 million in unpaid tax , fines and interest compared well with other countries			0
but ms @entity40 told her that the @entity129 tax authorities had recouped £ 200 million from 3,000 names and the @entity279 £ 180 million from 2,900			0
and she told the @entity32 chief : ' it 's pretty outrageous what was going on			0
' it 's the first time in many of these leaks that there are really strong allegations not of egregious tax avoidance , but of tax evasion , and that is incredibly serious			1
' for you to sit there and say , as you are doing , that " we could n't get the money in in the same way as the @entity129 and @entity279 did " and " we did n't litigate because we wanted to get the money in " and yet you did worse on the money - it leaves me believing that you are not serving the @entity44 taxpayer			0
