my usual look : swept off the face most women know that the right haircut and colour can take years off your appearance , but few spend time worrying about how their parting is ageing their face , writes @entity11			1
however , according to celebrity hair - stylist @entity13 , the wrong parting can make us look years older - dragging down features - while the right parting can be almost as rejuvenating as a visit to a plastic surgeon			1
i 'm so unsure what to do with my own parting that i usually sweep my hair back in a slightly skew - whiff messy look			1
yet at 45 , i 'm eager to turn back the clock			1
here , with the help of @entity25 , chief stylist at @entity13 's @entity27 salon , i try five different partings to see if they make me look older or younger - with staggering results			1
ageing : the centre parting looks too severe how to do it : it 's easiest to get a clean parting on damp hair			1
take the sharp end of a tail comb and , starting at your hairline , guide the point of the comb straight through the centre of your head , using the teeth to smooth down the sides as you go			0
verdict : i hate this parting ! i had hoped that this look would be chic and sleek , but sadly , i look old and severe - like a desiccated @entity50			1
my hair has no body at the crown and hangs limply down the sides of my face			1
although i only coloured my hair a month ago , the parting shows off my obvious re-growth and , let â€™s face it , grey hairs are anything but youthful			1
' unless you can afford to have your roots touched up every few weeks , it is best to avoid severe partings , ' @entity25 admits			0
' this is a classic look			0
it 's elegant , but on you it is a little ageing as it drags the face downwards			0
' trendy : the zig - zag adds volume how to do it : this one is a little trickier			2
first , create your classic centre parting as before , then , with the tail of your comb , lift a section of hair from a centimetre to the left of your parting and flick it over to the right , smoothing with your comb			1
do the same on the right side and then repeat every couple of centimetres until you reach the crown of your head			0
verdict : i 'm wary of this one			0
it may be a @entity72 , but it 's still a centre parting , which , i 'm now convinced , makes me look ancient			2
but @entity25 insists : ' the slightly messy look will soften your features , making you look younger			0
and a jagged parting will make hair look thicker			1
' the zig - zag effect adds volume , which lifts the cheekbones , making the face look more youthful			2
' and it does ! not only does it seem to lift my face , but the trendier style makes me look less austere and grannyish			0
result ! flattering : the parting makes the eyes look bigger how to do it : my right eye is noticeably bigger and wider than my left , so @entity25 explains that parting my hair on the right should be flattering as it will bring attention to this eye			1
i 'm getting to be a dab hand with the tail comb now , but i still have to reposition this line a couple of times until @entity25 's satisfied i 've got it exactly right			0
verdict : i love it ! i think i look much younger and @entity25 explains why			0
' having your hair sweeping from right to left emphasises your wider eye , and wider eyes give your face the appearance of youth , ' he says			2
' parting your hair this way will always make you look younger			1
' my hair seems to have more volume and body as well , which combine to make me look more youthful			1
the added volume , especially around the cheekbones , makes my face look a bit fuller , too , and distracts from my sagging jawline			0
hurrah ! sculpted : it 's chic but not right for @entity11 how to do it : this time we use the thin outer edge of my eyebrow as a guide			1
starting from that point we run the tail of the comb neatly from the front to the back of my head , smoothing the sides down as we go			0
' using the natural line of the eyebrow as a guide , you get a parting that helps to create a flattering look , ' he explains			2
verdict : i can see that the low parting looks sculpted and chic			2
but i suspect i do n't have the flamboyance and dramatic flair necessary to carry this off			0
' it looks fabulous , vibrant			0
you could wear it to a party , ' enthuses @entity25 as he showers me in hairspray			0
but i 'm not convinced , it 's for me			0
it looks like a comb - over gone wrong and it 's much too trendy			1
my hair now dips down far too low on my forehead to be flattering , and , when i look in the mirror , my attention 's drawn straight to the edge of my crow 's feet			2
favourite look : this kind of parting is also favoured by the @entity189 how to do it : @entity25 explains that the way to find the perfect position for an off - centre parting is to trace a line up from the inner edge of my right eye and then part my hair directly in alignment with that point			1
i could get the hang of this one			0
verdict : this is my favourite parting and i 'm in good company			2
@entity203 of @entity204 often has her hair parted in a similar fashion			2
the difference an inch makes is amazing			0
it 's surprisingly flattering , softening my face and distracting from my wobbly jawline			0
' as we age our faces begin to lose definition , but this parting draws attention to the eyes and the cheekbones and away from the sagging bits , ' @entity25 explains			0
the parting also gives my hair more body , which makes me look younger			1
my new parting has forced my hair to hang in a different way , and the swoop across my forehead breaks up my frown lines quite brilliantly .			1
