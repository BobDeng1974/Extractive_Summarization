by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was pictured arriving in @entity3 with his wife and daughter on monday night ahead of his £ 75million move from @entity7			1
the @entity9 striker touched down in @entity10 in the early hours and will complete his dream transfer to the @entity12			1
@entity2 leaves @entity7 to head to @entity13 having arrived in january 2011 from @entity14			1
@entity15 confirmed that @entity3 will not be allowed to publicly unveil @entity2 while he remains banned for biting			1
the @entity17 club has previously introduced star signings including @entity19 and @entity20 to packed stadiums			0
@entity15 's head of media @entity44 said : ' the ban relates to all football - related activity			2
he can not be in a football - related public event irrespective of the venue			0
' he can not even be involved in a football - related charity event			0
' @entity2 , 27 , had his appeal against the four - month ban , plus a nine - match international and an 100,000 @entity54 franc ( £ 66,000 ) fine , rejected outright by @entity15 's appeals committee			1
he is expected to take his appeal to the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) in a final bid to reduce the sanctions that , as they stand , will keep him out of club football until the end of october			0
name on the shirt : but @entity2 ca n't be shown off to fans at the @entity12 or elsewhere number nine : they might not be able to unveil him but @entity3 fans can already buy @entity2 's shirt different : @entity19 and @entity20 both underwent high profile unveilings at the @entity12 painful blow : @entity2 's bite on @entity38 led to him getting his four - month ban from football - related activity chomping at the bit : the bite on @entity38 was @entity2 's third such incident , leading to heavy punishment @entity78 will fit in at @entity3 - @entity79 @entity2 can also ask @entity57 to put his ban on hold pending their final decision but that would risk him missing more matches rather than a chunk of the close season if the court upholds the sanctions			1
some 90,000 packed the @entity12 stadium for the unveiling of @entity91 forward @entity19 in june 2013			0
@entity15 's original ban took into account that @entity2 had shown no remorse for the biting incident , his third such attack in less than four years			2
the player then did issue an official apology but it did not lead to any change of mind by the @entity15 appeals panel			0
@entity2 's lawyer claimed the punishment was ' blatantly draconian , totalitarian and fascist '			1
@entity104 told @entity106 radio station @entity107 : ' the right of a footballer to work is being violated , and football should be worried about that			0
' the nine ( international ) games may seem excessive , but the fact that he ca n't watch a game of football , or train or carry out his job , we are talking about unpleasant things			0
' back in the day : @entity2 at his @entity7 unveiling in 2011 - alongside @entity121 and @entity122 seeing is believing : @entity2 was voted @entity124 last season after a stunning campaign with @entity7 happy days : @entity2 arriving at @entity128 in 2011 ( left ) and lifting the @entity129 in 2012 ( right ) haunted : the 27 - year - old scored twice for @entity37 against @entity131 at the @entity132 in @entity133			2
