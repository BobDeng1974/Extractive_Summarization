by @entity0 published : 11:00 est , 14 september 2012 updated : 12:31 est , 14 september 2012 for 60 - year - old @entity1 and @entity2 , 50 , who met in the most unlikely of places and on different ends of the country , battling lung cancer would be near impossible if they were n't doing it together			1
' we were n't looking for a relationship , but we surprised each other , ' mr @entity1 , who ’s currently battling non-small - cell adenocarcinoma , told @entity13			1
a divorced father of two , mr @entity1 met ms @entity2 , a mother of two herself , in 2011 through an online community called @entity17 that connects those battling and looking to discuss health issues			1
together : seen hand - in - hand , @entity1 and @entity2 are sharing not only a blooming romance from opposite parts of the country , but a fight for their lives against lung cancer an at first unlikely match judging by location , with mr @entity1 living in @entity30 , @entity31 and ms @entity2 in @entity32 , @entity33 , the two became close over their shared interests and struggle			1
after some back and forth discussing nutritional benefits in juicing - on a website they both agree to be the furthest from a dating page - it did n't take long before they checked out one another 's @entity42 profiles , became intrigued , and then began messaging			0
' we started chatting back and forth , different messages each day , ' mr @entity1 told @entity13			1
' at one time , i had over 5,000 text messages and they were mostly all with @entity2			1
' after first messaging one another in october , by december , they decided to meet			0
' most people meet in a public place , but you go across the country , ' ms @entity2 recalled one of a friend teasing her of her on - set adventure out to @entity31			1
breaking distance : since their diagnosis and meet in 2011 , the couple say they want to spend the rest of their lives together , while traveling across the country together for their cancer treatments since then ms @entity2 has made three trips to the @entity71 while mr @entity72 has done the same east			1
' we want to spend the rest of our lives together , ' the couple not long later posted to their online friends in a note that was picked up by @entity17 's communications director			2
while the couple 's attachment to one another was easily amplified by their cancer treatments - with mr @entity1 scheduling his appointments to match hers with doctors on the west and ms @entity2 doing the same on the east – they both mutually also shared the same hardship in their loved ones ' reaction to their diagnosis of cancer			1
diagnosed after seeing a doctor over what she thought was her asthma flaring up after six months , ms @entity2 was entirely beside herself when an x-ray instead discovered small - cell cancer in her lungs while already at an ' extensive ' stage			1
her boyfriend at the time , she said , had a hard time handling it too			0
' he walked out on me a week before we were talking about getting married , ' ms @entity2 told @entity13			1
' he said , " i do n't love you anymore			0
" ' time together : seen in @entity109 , @entity33 , the couple have made at least six visits to opposite sides of the country in the last year to be with one another mr @entity1 said he had the same reaction from his girlfriend at the time			1
' she knew i had lung cancer and at some point , did n't want to deal with it , ' he said , who was diagnosed after a spontaneous chest x-ray in 2009			0
coming out of surgery on her adrenal gland and liver , not long after her breakup with her fiancé , ms @entity2 said she never expected a single surprise waiting for her that could make her feel any less alone			1
' when i came out of recovery and got into the room , flowers were awaiting me , ' she said			0
' they were from @entity1			1
' it 's hard to stay positive , ' she said , ' but every day i have @entity1 , i feel pretty positive			1
' ' we have been seeing each other long distance for a year and have never had a disagreement , ' said mr @entity1			2
' the fact is , we are going through this together and support each other			0
... we laugh a lot			0
' ms @entity2 's cancer has since tragically mutated though , leaving her with a large - cell lesion on her breast			2
she also has three lesions on her brain that have received 15 rounds of radiation			0
she said her steroid treatments weaken her muscles and her double - strength radiation on her chest once burned a hole into her esophagus , preventing her from eating for weeks			0
' that was the worst , ' she said			0
diagnosis : mr @entity1 , an avid hiker , was only diagnosed after a chest x-ray for a volunteer programme 's requirements while ms @entity2 was diagnosed after an x-ray over what she thought was her asthma acting up thirty - nine months after mr @entity1 's diagnosis , including all of his own radiation , chemotherapy and oral medication , his cancer remains stable			1
' i 'm really fortunate , ' he told @entity13			0
while their struggle is potentially heart breaking to hear for some , they say it 's their love story , and one that keeps their own hearts going			0
- @entity1 ' it 's critical to have things like that to keep you positive , ' said mr @entity1			2
' any cancer survivor has to have short - term goals , so i look forward to being with @entity2			2
we never know what will happen to either one of us			0
' it 's also one they hope to use to save others , informing them about the importance of being screened for lung cancer			0
ms @entity2 notes that people should be screened whether they smoke or not , herself having quit 15 years ago and mr @entity192			2
it was n't until mr @entity1 was tested for tuberculosis with a chest x-ray , in order to take part in a volunteer programme , that he said he first realized something was wrong			2
currently on the west coast together , the couple plan to spend the next month traveling from @entity202 to attend ms @entity2 's son 's wedding to a potential trip to @entity206			2
these are all , of course , scheduled around their cancer treatments			0
in february they said they hope to make a trip to @entity214 as well			0
' i admire her strength , ' mr @entity1 said of ms @entity2			1
' she has been through a lot in such a short time			0

@entity1 , 60 , and @entity2 , 50 , say they share not only a daily battle for their lives but a blooming romance that helps keep them going
