@entity1 were victorious in @entity2 , as many thought they would be			2
they did n’t win big enough to progress , however , as few thought they would do			0
well organised , disciplined , brave , resolute			0
the region may be famous for speculation and bold gambles , but @entity11 would be proud of the side produced by his compatriot @entity13			0
this was a pragmatic , impressive display against a team who knew they needed three goals and threw all they had at that task in the second half			1

ratings by @entity83 in @entity7 it was horribly tense for @entity7 once @entity70 scored @entity1 ’s second with 11 minutes to go — but , once again , in this competition @entity24 ’s team lost it in the first leg			1
that third away goal at the @entity90 was the killer			0
it was the one @entity24 ’s players could not match			0
@entity7 knew they had done the hardest yards in @entity96 and ultimately settled for heroic defeat			2
it was like watching one of @entity101 ’s fourth - day specials			0
they played to par , laid up at the big one , did n’t take the course on , and won			0
as @entity1 threw more at it with the minutes slipping away , @entity7 pressed forward and substitute @entity32 nipped one across the face of goal that could have ended the contest there and then			1
instead , @entity1 were left with hope right until the end , a goal short of the last eight			2
it is the hope that does for you in the end , of course			0
it probably would have hurt less to have lost both legs			0
the goal that brought @entity1 to the brink of one of the greatest fightbacks in @entity23 history came in the 79th minute after @entity72 hit a post with a side - footed shot			1
a rare moment of blind panic saw full back @entity51 clear horribly straight to @entity70			2
he took a touch and struck it low into the far corner			0
cue pandemonium in the closing stages , not least when referee @entity80 , from @entity132 , signalled a generous period of five minutes additional time			0
yet , really , @entity1 did little with it			2
they lumped it in , @entity7 hoofed it out			2
predictably , @entity7 ’s hoofs were better than @entity1 ’s lumps			1
it really is n’t their game			0
nor is the high - tempo , high - energy , gung - ho rollercoaster that was @entity142 ’s famous comeback against @entity143 in the @entity144 , a repeat of which may just have rattled the @entity147 side			0
four goals and a goalkeeper down at half - time , @entity142 pulled it back to 4 - 3 and would surely have drawn level had they not run out of time			1
@entity37 scored in the first half at the @entity38 to give @entity1 hope of pulling off a comeback in their last - 16 tie the @entity147 striker picked his spot from a tight angle to give @entity1 the lead over @entity7 in the last 16 second leg @entity7 's defenders on the line can not stop @entity37 's 36th - minute shot from hitting the roof of the net @entity37 's goal left @entity1 needing two more to progress in the remaining 55 minutes in the @entity147 principality yet they had @entity170 in the ranks that night			1
@entity1 have lovely passers and schemers but nobody who is going to terrify a back four as @entity170 did			2
the best they could offer was @entity37 trying to pretend he was @entity176 , with @entity40 in the @entity178 role			2
@entity7 lapped up his timid floaters			2
a more furious approach might have disturbed them , but @entity1 lacked that verve			2
equally , @entity7 ’s centre halves , @entity184 and @entity50 , were exceptional — a different league from the @entity143 team that @entity142 faced			1
so it is now down to @entity188 , the last @entity190 team standing , to restore @entity192 pride and claim a place in the @entity23 quarter - finals			1
they trail 2 - 1 with a return leg in @entity198 ’s @entity197			0
nobody is holding their breath			0
they were the rank outsiders going into these rematches			0
@entity70 came off the bench to score @entity1 's second in the 79th minute to set up a grandstand finish @entity70 celebrates his goal with @entity208 to pull @entity1 within one goal of pulling off an unlikely comeback @entity66 celebrates @entity70 's goal as @entity1 pushed their opponents all the way in their last - 16 contest @entity70 's strike in the 79th minute was the 300th goal in @entity218 competition that @entity1 have scored under @entity24			1
@entity219 did not have representation beyond the second round in 2013 , either , but twice in three years will be a bitter pill to swallow			0
@entity1 were the better team last night but then they had to be			1
they had significant levels of possession in the second half without really threatening goalkeeper @entity226 for long periods			1
for @entity7 to progress on away goals appears close but , once again , @entity1 deceive			1
they were never in a winning position , on aggregate , in the 180 minutes of the tie			0
@entity1 grew into the game after a flat opening 15 minutes enlivened only by a cross from @entity65 that @entity37 headed wide			1
@entity22 , whose heat map is shown above , was at the centre of most of @entity1 's attacking play			1
click here for match zone @entity73 goes down in the @entity7 penalty area after being pursued by @entity55 @entity1 's @entity242 forward @entity73 is booked by referee @entity80 for simulation the yellow card given to @entity1 striker @entity73 for diving after 41 minutes was a poor decision by @entity132 referee @entity80			1
maybe the contact was n’t enough for a penalty but it was n’t a dive			0
you can see what @entity73 thought of the referee ’s decision ! from there , however , the game began to progress along familiar lines , @entity1 in the ascendancy , @entity7 retreating to massed ranks of stout defence			1
for a while it looked as if they were more than capable of holding out — @entity7 are a tight defensive unit with that most old - fashioned of qualities , a couple of big units who do n’t mind putting a foot in — but @entity1 got a breakthrough after 36 minutes			1
it was @entity71 who set up the goal , driving forward and slipping his final pass to @entity37 , who was left with only @entity226 to beat			1
@entity37 ’s shot was blocked , but the ball rebounded and struck him on the shoulder			2
with @entity226 stranded on the floor , @entity37 reacted quickest and after scanning the immediate area , seized on the loose ball , rifling it into the roof of the net with @entity7 ’s covering defenders helpless			1
after his travails in the first leg — hooked by @entity24 to utter derision , having missed enough chances to put @entity1 in the quarter - finals – this was a perfect response			1
he had at least guaranteed to outstrip the two marks out of ten he previously received from @entity147 newspaper @entity291			0
just two minutes later , @entity1 could have been further ahead			2
@entity292 hit a cross which was cleared under pressure from @entity37 and fell to @entity71 whose shot was blocked , sprawling , by @entity50			2
even then , it spun and almost squeaked over the line as @entity226 scrambled to recover			0
@entity73 was booked for diving , which seemed harsh — it did n’t look like a foul , but not a dive either — and @entity24 may take a dim view privately of @entity40 ’s decision to swap shirts with @entity53 at half - time			0
@entity37 rises highest in the @entity7 penalty area to unleash a header towards goal which just went wide of the far post @entity40 swaps shirts with @entity7 's @entity53 at half - time at the @entity38 @entity7 goalkeeper @entity226 makes a save from @entity37 during the first half of the second leg clash in @entity7 @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity7 , @entity318 wednesday : @entity198 ( 2 ) vs @entity188 ( 1 ) ; @entity319 ( 1 ) vs @entity320 ( 2 ) true , it was at @entity53 ’s request , but it hardly fitted in with the cold determination required to conjure victory against a team that had not conceded three goals at home since 2011			1
sure enough , one of @entity53 ’s first acts of the second half was to go in late on @entity22 , provoking a scream that could be heard all around the @entity38 that was a different kind of souvenir to take home			0
from the free - kick @entity40 ’s dipper was flicked over by @entity226 , in no mood to return any favours			2
@entity340 explains @entity24 handshake snub prince @entity342 ( right ) and @entity7 's @entity344 president @entity343 ( left ) were in the stands to watch the game members of @entity349 rock band @entity348 watched the game at the @entity38 on @entity350 the @entity38 in @entity7 before kick - off as the sun sets over the @entity147 principality			1

@entity1 eliminated from the @entity23 on away goals rule in the last - 16 stage
@entity37 scored in the first half before @entity70 came off the bench to add a second in the 79th minute
@entity188 are the only @entity192 team remaining in this year 's competition
