the north - south divide between @entity3 's cities has widened ' dramatically ' , a new report warns today			1
for every 12 people who found work since 2004 in cities in southern @entity9 , only one was hired in cities in the rest of the country , research by the @entity5 found			1
employment in @entity15 increased by more than 17 per cent between 2004 and 2013 while @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 saw falls of 10 per cent , said the report			1
the number of employees in @entity23 , @entity15 and @entity24 rose by more than 15 % over a decade , but fell in cities like @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity16 national economic growth in the last decade has been fuelled by a boom in just a handful of cities , most of them in the south of @entity9			1
numbers in work in @entity15 rose by more than 17 per cent between 2004 and 2013 while @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 saw falls of 10 per cent , said the report			1
there was also a huge difference in populations , growing by 16.5 per cent in @entity23 and falling by 1.4 per cent in @entity39			0
the number of new businesses varied - up by almost a third in @entity42 but down by 5.5 per cent in @entity43			0
@entity45 , acting chief executive of @entity5 , said : ' five months out from the election , this report makes the strongest economic case yet for the next government to step up to the challenge of investing in the long - term success of our cities , and build a brighter future in which more people and places can contribute to , and share in , prosperity and growth			2
' the stark picture the report paints of the enormous gap in the fortunes of @entity3 cities over 10 years underlines why a ' steady as she goes ' approach must be scrapped			1
' we must move from thinking that bundling up new funding streams with bureaucratic delays , or simply tinkering around the edges with well - intentioned announcements , will be enough to reverse trends that are becoming increasingly entrenched			0
' @entity72 , director of @entity73 , said more powers needed to be devolved to regions to help them create prosperity and ensure smaller places do not fall behind as core cities grow			0
the number of businesses rose sharply in southern cities like @entity15 , @entity42 and @entity81 between 2004 and 2013 , but fell in @entity16 and @entity43 , the report found cities minister @entity83 , said : ' this government 's long - term economic plan is working right across the country			1
' since 2010 over 60 per cent of the rise in employment has taken place outside @entity15 and the @entity90 - that 's over a million more people in work			2
we know there is more to do and that 's why we have given greater powers to 27 of the @entity3 's largest cities through @entity99 , and why we have committed a further £ 7 billion to the north of @entity9 , alongside the ground - breaking devolution deals and £ 6 billion of growth deals in every part of @entity9			2
' shadow business secretary @entity104 said : ' @entity105 highlights the huge potential for more balanced growth across @entity3 by devolving powers and budgets			2
' the @entity111 - led government came to office promising to rebalance the economy but instead we 've seen too many parts of @entity3 held back and the benefits of growth being concentrated in the hands of the few			0
' under this government , cities with the greatest needs have been hit hardest			0
' the next @entity123 government will push power away from @entity125 and give city and county regions and local areas the powers they need to boost local growth			0
' under our plans £ 30bn of budgets would be devolved down and combined authorities would be able to keep more of their revenue from business rates so they can benefit from additional growth			0
