hungry : in his quest for food the dopey bear attempts to clamber to higher ground but finds himself sliding down into a space between two rocks above the stream trapped : the animal finds himself stuck in the crevice and starts trying to free himself by wriggling his body going ... looking a little bemused bemused by his plight , the animal slips down further into the moss - lined gap going ... the bear makes one last valiant attempt to free himself by pulling himself up by his giant paws gone ! the bear gives up and slides down into the crevice until just his furry snout is visible between the rocks no problem : the greedy bear appears unperturbed by his situation continues to fish for food by reaching its big paw down between the rocks and dipping it into the water below			2
