on saturday afternoon , with the sun a-glow and the pitch pristine , @entity0 moved without too much fuss in their second innings to 53 for one			1
the remnants of @entity8 were set to wipe out the fourth day and possibly the fifth			2
@entity10 was in hospital with a broken nose ; @entity13 was struggling with a bug			1
survive until stumps , and there was a chance @entity0 would have arrived at @entity18 this week at 1 - 1			1
what followed was the kind of surrender that gives white flags a bad name			0
nine wickets fell in 22 overs – six of them to @entity26 and @entity27 – and the captain was out slogging to midwicket			1
@entity31 , you see : cool in a crisis			1
irresponsible : @entity31 ( left ) can only watch as @entity33 catches his attempted slog at midwicket for @entity0 , bowled out twice in the equivalent of a day ’s play , there was worse to come			1
talking to @entity39 , @entity31 insisted he was ‘ quite happy ’ with his team ’s ‘ progress ’			1
there is sticking up for your players in public , and there is taking the mick			0
@entity31 did n’t merely cross that line : he jumped the shark			1
that evening , on @entity52 ’s verdict show , @entity50 unwittingly revealed one of @entity0 ’s biggest problems			2
instead of taking @entity31 to task , @entity50 – a veteran defender of @entity0 ’s cricket establishment – suggested the captain had simply wanted to escape the interview as quickly as possible			1
as anyone who has sat through a @entity31 press conference will know , brevity is not his greatest strength			2
not for the first time in @entity0 ’s long sequence of overseas failures under @entity31 – the win at @entity67 was the notable exception – he was being given an armchair ride			1
since the euphoria of that victory , a result that seems to have used up their entire stock of emotional energy , @entity0 have – to adapt @entity71 ’s assessment of @entity72 – been third - best in this series , behind @entity74 and daylight			1
at @entity83 and @entity84 , they have scored 821 runs for the loss of 40 wickets ; @entity74 have managed 1,141 runs – in one innings fewer – for the loss of 21 wickets ( or 20 , if you do n’t count @entity10 ’s nasal issues )			1
in other words , @entity0 have averaged 20 per wicket to @entity74 ’s 57			1
it has become 2011 all over again			0
taking the mick : @entity31 trudges off after his irresponsible dismissal ( left ) then insisted he was happy with @entity0 video @entity0 problems have been addressed - @entity31 for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin @entity0 ’s chopping and changing has n’t helped : @entity74 would still rather come up against @entity102 than @entity103 , and the tourists are yet to pick the right bowling combination			1
@entity106 ( this summer averaging 22 with the bat and 46 with the ball ) appears to owe his selection to the friends he has in high places			0
and they have come up against an @entity74 side that has finally woken up to a few harsh truths after sleep - walking through the first half of the season			2
increasingly , the slip catch put down by @entity106 to reprieve @entity119 on 15 during the opening session at the @entity121 looks like the turning point of the series – and perhaps , who knows , of a career			0
@entity119 made 95 , the mood in the dressing - room lifted in homage to a popular captain , and @entity0 almost instantly went on the defensive			1
cult - hero status for @entity132 is no consolation			0
it 's all over : @entity132 was comprehensively bowled by @entity27 to seal victory for @entity74 pair of aces : @entity13 and @entity10 are becoming an all - time great double act since then , @entity74 have just got on with it			1
one of their smartest decisions was to insulate the players from the @entity143 spat			0
cricket was the thing , not a waste - of - money inquest			0
the @entity148 , by contrast , would n’t let it go : @entity31 was still expounding at length on the matter on the eve of the @entity152			1
it would be too facile to say that @entity0 have lost two tests because they were distracted			2
equally , they spent too much time nursing a sense of injustice beyond its proper proportion			0
as the driving force behind the decision to pursue @entity13 , @entity31 has to bear the blame			1
while @entity0 fiddled , @entity74 fired			1
handed a pair of pitches replete with pace and carry , their big names enjoyed themselves			2
in the last two tests , @entity13 has picked up 12 wickets at 11 , @entity10 nine at 12			1
their combined analysis has been 114.5 - 41 - 254 - 21			0
they are edging into the category of an all - time great double act			0
@entity174 has responded with a sublime 167 , a selfless 23 and a classy 58			0
and @entity175 is starting to bat as if determined to cast himself as a responsibility - bearing senior			2
there remain issues , of course , and @entity0 ’s hopelessness has put a gloss on much of what @entity74 have done			1
@entity184 and @entity27 have claimed four wickets between them at 84 each ( and leaked 3.61 an over ) , while @entity188 is one @entity189 away from the axe			0
but @entity74 are rebuilding : what did we expect ? better , perhaps , to dwell on another trio			2
for @entity33 , @entity195 ( the off - spinner rather than the batsman , for the time being at least ) and @entity199 , test cricket must feel like a ball			1
misery - guts are wondering whether they ’ll be able to prosper next year against @entity202			0
after the winter from hell , @entity74 will settle for the shoots of spring			2
@entity207 taking action one by one , they are being picked off			2
back in may , the @entity210 – acting on a tip - off – asked the @entity212 whether it was ‘ right that the actions of several bowlers during the recent @entity215 were a concern ? ’ and whether those bowlers were ‘ now being watched closely ? ’ we were fobbed off with an answer about the fact that no new instructions had been issued to match officials concerning the reporting of illegal actions			0
which did n’t really help			0
events since then have explained the evasion			0
last month both @entity229 ’s @entity228 and @entity231 ’s @entity230 were banned ; now it ’s @entity234 ’s @entity233			2
all three are off - spinners with a noticeable kink in their action			0
since the @entity212 ’s 15 - degree rule was brought in because that was said to be the level of flexion visible to the naked eye , it seems due process is being followed			0
elbowing in : @entity233 ( right ) has been reported for a suspected illegal bowling action conspiracy theorists will note that the umpires who reported @entity233 on the fourth day of the @entity248 against @entity229 were @entity249 and @entity250 , an @entity251 and an @entity252 – and thus , in many @entity254 eyes , representatives of the old , white world order			1
others will wonder how it took the authorities so long			0
either way , the game has finally got serious about elbows which are straightening at the point of delivery			0
and if you think that ’s a conspiracy , you need to get out more			0
only @entity267 better @entity267 averaged a handy 101 in his 24 tests as captain			1
but , for once , he may be shifting uncomfortably in his grave			0
@entity272 ’ double of 91 and 25 * as @entity229 pinched the @entity189 against @entity234 on sunday seconds before the heavens opened took his record while captain to 1,304 runs at an average of nearly 87 – compared with a pre-captaincy figure of under 40			1
only @entity267 lies ahead of him			2
so much for the burdens of office			0
becoming the @entity267 : @entity272 has a superb batting average as captain of @entity229 provincial angst with three tests out of seven each summer all but allocated to the @entity286 venues for the foreseeable future , the scramble is on among the @entity289 ’s seven other test grounds to stage matches and recoup the millions of pounds the @entity291 encouraged them to spend on upgrades several years ago – precisely so that they were in a position to hold games which are now increasingly hard to come by			1
so it ’s a pity the @entity299 venues have all encountered mishaps this summer			1
@entity301 was always going to struggle to sell tickets against @entity229			0
the @entity304 pitch was rated poor by the @entity212			0
the @entity121 felt half - empty after the opening day			0
and @entity306 has a drainage issue			2
perhaps the biggest winners have been @entity309 , @entity310 and @entity311			0
putting a dampner on things : the drainage issue at @entity306 that wiped out the rest of day two a question of consistency @entity318 has removed from its website a video gleefully detailing the mistakes made by @entity322 before @entity74 replaced him with @entity199			1
the @entity291 were said to be unhappy with the tone of the video , but the reason given for its removal was copyright			0
still , the thought occurred to one wag on @entity331 : will @entity318 now run a montage of @entity31 ’s blunders behind the stumps this summer ? thought not .			2

@entity74 bowled @entity0 out twice in the equivalent of a day 's play
the @entity148 collapsed to defeat at @entity306 but @entity31 was defended
@entity13 and @entity10 have pitches that suit them
@entity33 , @entity175 , @entity26 and @entity199 are all impressing
@entity233 latest spinner to have his action reported
@entity272 ' batting record as captain second only to *sir* @entity267
@entity352 venues have encountered *unfortunate* mishaps
