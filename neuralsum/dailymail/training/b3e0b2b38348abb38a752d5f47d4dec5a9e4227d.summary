by @entity0 published : 08:56 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 06:35 est , 14 march 2013 killed in battle : @entity2 after his last resting place beneath a council car park , anything would be an improvement for @entity2 but following one row over whether his remains should be reburied in @entity11 or @entity12 , a new dispute emerged yesterday over how grand the tomb should be			1
despite calls for an elaborate memorial , it seems the last @entity18 king will have to make do with something much more simple within @entity20			1
the cathedral ’s design brief specifies a preference for ‘ a place of simple dignity ’ – an engraved memorial stone			1
it informs architects the church authorities would like to ‘ mark the place of burial with a ledger stone ’ which sits flat on the floor , possibly with a ‘ decorative border ’			2
anything more grandiose would be ‘ disproportionate ’			0
the new monument will be placed on the spot where a memorial stone commemorating the 15th century king currently sits within the chancel			1
‘ while the remains of an @entity45 king are of historical significance , it should not be forgotten that @entity2 demonstrated both the honourable and dishonourable characteristics of human beings , ’ the brief states			1
‘ opportunities for prayer and reflection should focus on themes of sin and redemption , justice and peace			0
’ the proposal was greeted with dismay by @entity59 of the @entity60 , who led the campaign to search for the king ’s remains which were unearthed last year under the car park near @entity20			1
she had commissioned a raised limestone tomb embellished with @entity2 ’s symbols and said she was ‘ shocked and disappointed ’ by the design brief			1
the stone referring to @entity2 at @entity20 , the spot where the recently discovered remains will interred the @entity60 , which was behind the finds of the remain , has proposed a simple tomb remains of a king : the skeleton of @entity2 was found under a car park in @entity11 the remains will be interred in @entity20 in may next year , with a large memorial service ‘ from the very beginning of my search for @entity2 , i always said that we would honour him with a tomb – one fitting for a king of @entity45 , ’ miss @entity59 said			1
‘ we designed an incredibly understated tomb to fit with a modern cathedral , not a pastiche of a medieval tomb			0
’ @entity2 was killed at the @entity89 , near @entity11 , in 1485			2
his defeat marked the end of the @entity92 and the rise of the @entity95 dynasty			0
he has been portrayed as a power - mad child killer who slaughtered his two young nephews – the @entity98 – to seize the throne			0
others claim he was a visionary reformer			0
some believe @entity2 , who belonged to the @entity12 , should be reburied at @entity102			2
but it appears his final burial place will be in @entity20			2
the skeleton found under @entity107 car park in @entity11 which was found to be that of @entity2 the world 's only facial reconstruction of @entity2 is unveiled 528 years after his death by @entity59 , originator of the ' @entity114 " project one woman 's hunch led to the discovery of the skeleton which has now been proven to be that of @entity2 screenwriter @entity59 , pictured right , said she felt a chill on a hot summer 's day as she walked through the area where it was thought he was buried			1
the remarkable discovery of the remains , which , consistent with historical accounts of @entity2 , have both a curved spine back and wounded skull , was made last september			1
miss @entity59 was strolling across the car park used by @entity11 social services while researching a play about the king when she felt a chill in august 2009			0
' it was a hot summer and i had goosebumps so badly and i was freezing cold			0
i walked past a particular spot and absolutely knew i was walking on his grave , ' she told the @entity140			0
' i am a rational human being but the feeling i got was the same feeling i have had before when a truth is given to me			0
' miss @entity59 initially funded the excavation of what is now a @entity147 car park because she was ' 99 per cent certain ' that the remains were those of @entity2			2
miss @entity59 , who is a member of the @entity60 , is working on a documentary charting the excavation for @entity152 titled @entity2 : @entity153 in the @entity154 , which has been made alongside the university academics and will be screened tonight			0
she said the her play has been turned into a script for television and film , which is now ' getting serious interest from @entity161 and in the @entity162 '			0
the design brief includes a map of the @entity20 , annotated to show the route visitors will take when viewing the spot where @entity2 will be interred			1

the design brief for @entity2 's tomb has today been revealed by @entity20
remains will be *re-interred* on the spot where a memorial stone commemorating the king currently sits
