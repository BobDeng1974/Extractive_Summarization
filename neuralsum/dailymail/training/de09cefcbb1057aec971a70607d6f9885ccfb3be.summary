by @entity0 published : 19:39 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 17:11 est , 20 august 2013 for decades it was a closely guarded secret , one i only shared with my closest friends and family			2
then , last week , i was horrified to discover that i ’d been outed in a gossip column			1
a former colleague revealed that when i hosted a @entity9 reunion , all the guests had to bring their own food			2
not because it was a ‘ pot luck ’ dinner , where everyone brings a dish , nor because i ’d had a domestic emergency that meant i could n’t bake , but because i am a truly terrible cook			1
@entity0 : ' for years i have gone to great lengths to hide my kitchen catastrophes ' you can imagine my humiliation			2
after all , for years i have gone to great lengths to hide my kitchen catastrophes			2
many times i ’ve been invited to take part in @entity21 , but have always refused because i did n’t want to admit that my favourite recipe is ‘ pierce film and wait for ping ’			1
if i invite any of my children to have a cosy supper with me , they only accept on condition it ’s a takeaway			1
while i ’m consoled that @entity30 has now admitted she , too , is hopeless in the kitchen ( despite cookery lessons from none other than @entity35 ) , it ’s certainly never been more embarrassing to admit your culinary career peaked when you learned to boil an egg			1
we live in an age when tv listings are stuffed with people pan-frying and marinading , kneading and poaching , julienning and fileting			2
hairy bikers and elegant old ladies cook			2
how could i possibly confess that i can not cook ? that rather than @entity53 , i am disaster chef			1
@entity30 admitted one fo her greatest extravagances is hiring a personal chef , who cooks breakfast , lunch and dinner for the @entity61 three days a week			1
in an interview with @entity63 , the 39 - year - old also admitted that her chef is required to make gourmet meals which are then put in the freezer - her best friends @entity35 and @entity69 have even tried to teach her to cook and now the @entity70 off hype is back — the new series only begins tonight but shops are apparently already running low on mixing bowls and rolling pins — i am seriously considering emigration			1
@entity77 was so different when i was young			2
we @entity78 used to take pride in our @entity82 approach to food			2
how well i remember wartime meal ordeals , like egg - powder omelettes and spam rissoles			2
after @entity88 , @entity77 food became famous around the world for over-cooked vegetables floating in water , black pudding and suet roly - poly			2
at school , i was taught how to cook ‘ white stew ’ made out of something called ‘ scrag end ’ ( i ca n’t imagine which bit of the body it was , and what animal it could ever have belonged to ) and ‘ apple dumplings ’ , which were far more dumpling than apple			1
i have never attempted either since			2
in fact , cookery lessons put me off the whole process for life			2
my late mother did her best to reverse the damage			1
she was what used to be called ‘ a plain cook ’ — which meant no frills			2
in her case , it meant no flavour either			2
although i do remember that her roast potatoes had a unique taste of laundry			2
i never knew why , until my sister told me she ’d peel them days in advance , and keep them in a saucepan of cold water until needed			1
but i think it was the same saucepan she boiled our face - flannels in once a month to clean them			2
the one dish she excelled at was rice pudding , with delicious brown skin			0
but after eating rice puddings for ten years , out of sheer boredom i decided to try something new			1
i found a recipe for coffee mousse , persuaded mum to let me try it out at a family party , and arranged it prettily in little glass dishes			0
unfortunately , after a couple of hours in the fridge the strong coffee rose to the top , and the gelatine sank to the bottom			0
@entity140 supplied straws so that the guests could suck up the liquid , though nobody could chew through the gelatinous layer of rubber underneath			0
a recipe by @entity157 — the celebrity chef of the @entity158 — for chicken stuffed with cucumber that i made for another party took hours to create and ended up soggy and tasteless			1
a rich chocolate cake i attempted refused to solidify , no matter how long i left it in the oven , so in the end i poured it into a frying pan and fried it			0
things did n’t improve when i left home and moved into a flat and became my own hostess			1
you might think a casserole would be fool - proof			0
on the one occasion i attempted to make one from scratch , the meat turned into tough little squares of leather and , as i discovered later , guests hid them in their napkins			0
when my tv consumer programme @entity9 began , i invited one of our presenters , @entity185 , home to discuss a difficult investigation			0
i bought a quiche for supper			1
surely nothing could go wrong ? but i ’d failed to read the label and notice that it was frozen			0
so i served it , still in that state , to poor @entity196 , who never forgot it , and used to tell the story whenever i invited any of the team home			0
i did perfect one dish , though			0
my last - minute instant chicken casserole			0
first , find a chippy , and buy some cooked chicken pieces , one per guest and one extra in case of accident			1
next , buy several cans of vegetable soup and some chunky bread			0
put the chicken in a large saucepan , heat the soup , and pour over			0
serve with the bread and plenty of red wine to distract your guests from the taste			0
not on the menu : @entity222 paella , while green and mixed salads are in thankfully , when i became a working mother i had a series of excellent housekeepers who made nutritious meals for us			1
but , despite my previous disasters , i still had ambitions in the kitchen			0
when i interviewed chef @entity232 , i asked him the secret to being a wonderful cook , and he told me cooking food is putting love on a plate			1
perhaps that ’s why one year i decided to make @entity240 lunch for the family			1
to begin with i felt nothing but pride			0
the turkey was fine and the @entity246 sprouts edible			0
but then came pudding time			0
my late husband , @entity248 , poured brandy over the traditional @entity240 pud and set fire to it with satisfying dramatic effect			0
as the flames died down i spooned brandy cream over every portion , not noticing until we started eating that i ’d used the wrong condiment , and so i had covered every steaming , fragrant lump of pudding — the same pudding i had slaved hours over to create — with mayonnaise			1
only my gallantly loyal mother managed to eat it , and declare it was delicious			1
but then , she was used to my cooking			0
most recently i invited professor @entity268 , the respected child psychologist , to lunch to talk about @entity271 ’s work			1
somehow i managed to overcook the salmon , so it was brown and hard , but at the same time undercook the new potatoes , so they were like bullets			0
i apologised , and she was kind			0
as a psychologist , i hope she did n’t delve into my motivation and think that i was trying to poison her			1
as my poor family have often said ( in the style of @entity53 judges ) : ‘ cooking does not taste tougher than this			0
’ so i have now imposed upon myself a cardinal rule of entertaining : never cook , only assemble			0
in other words , buy prepared ingredients and put them together			0
the obvious example is salad , writes @entity0			0
' i love salads , not least because they 're raw and so ca n't be under - cooked or cooked to death ' the obvious example is salad			1
i love salads , not least because they ’re raw and so ca n’t be under - cooked or cooked to death			1
tear up a few lettuce leaves ( or buy them ready - prepared in a bag ) , add chopped spring onions , tomatoes and cucumber			0
serve alongside barbecued chicken , ( ready cooked by a supermarket ) , sliced ham , pre-cooked quails ’ eggs , a jar of mayonnaise and a little bottle of classic @entity306 dressing and it makes a very respectable lunch			1
for dessert , it ’s ripe camembert and biscuits , or my patent black - and - white pudding			1
for the sake of other non-cooks , i will share that pudding recipe — my own invention			0
take one carton of really classy shop - bought vanilla ice - cream			0
buy several punnets of blackberries and a bottle of creme de cassis blackcurrant liqueur			0
put several spoonfuls of ice cream in individual glass dishes , then sprinkle with blackberries ( or , as @entity327 would say , ‘ tumble ’ in the blackberries )			0
finally , pour the creme de cassis over everything			0
but i am aware salad and ice cream wo n’t do for every occasion , and i do love dinner with friends			1
so about 15 years ago , i created a small local dining club , consisting of friends , acquaintances and like - minded locals			0
one monday evening a month , we ’ll meet at a local restaurant for dinner , splitting the bill equally			1
it ’s the perfect solution for cooks as hopeless as me : there ’s no menu to devise or hours spent laying the table beforehand and washing up afterwards			1
it ’s not nearly as expensive as a caterer , you do n’t need to know exact numbers , and single women are welcome			1
and most importantly for me , i do n’t have to go through the torture of eating stuff i ’ve cooked			1
in retrospect , it ’s what i should have done for the now - infamous @entity9 reunion			1
so will i be watching @entity361 , @entity362 and their baker ’s dozen of eager would - be pastry chefs over the forthcoming weeks ? no. my thoughts go out to all the hopeless non-cooks , who like me will spend tuesday nights hiding behind our sofas shouting ‘ @entity373 , back off ! ’			2

if i invite any of my children to have a cosy supper with me , they only accept on condition it ’s a takeaway
