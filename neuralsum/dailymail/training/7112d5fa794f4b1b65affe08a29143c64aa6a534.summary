by @entity0 once seen as the bastion of counter-culture a common criticism leveled at the @entity5 festival in recent years is that it has blanded out and become overrun with too many business - minded from the tech industry			1
and @entity10 co-founder @entity9 did nothing to dispel that image when he revealed in a blog entry on thursday that he took his boss @entity14 along to last week 's event in the @entity16			1
@entity9 met @entity14 at @entity17 , dropped out at the same time and is now worth an estimated $ 4 billion			1
so inspired was @entity9 on his return from a week in the desert that he wrote a blog post ‘ radical inclusion vs. @entity23 at @entity5 ’ in which he revealed that @entity14 had stayed at the camp he built			1
burning man veteran and @entity10 co-founder @entity25 has revealed that this year he took his boss @entity14 along and that he mucked in and helped to put his own tent up party in the desert : over 60,000 revelers converged on the @entity30 in @entity16 last week for the @entity5 festival the blog featured a lengthy explanation of @entity9 's cool burning man credentials - because he ’s been the past five years - and he went on to give an interesting insight into what all those geeks were up to out in the desert			1
he confirmed that @entity14 had been in attendance , but was quick to deny any suggestions that his boss had ‘ paid into a turnkey experience			1
’ ‘ along with its other inhabitants , he helped pitch his own tent , ’ wrote @entity9			2
‘ i wanted him to experience the city and to experience gifting because i thought it would make him grow as a person and the world better off as a result ; i believe that ’s exactly what happened , however marginally ( he was already a pretty great person )			1
’ @entity10 co-founder @entity25 has revealed that he bumped into the @entity51 twins at the @entity5 festival in the @entity16 desert and that all is forgiven for when they tried to sued him @entity9 also revealed that he had an emotional meeting with former arch enemies the @entity51 twins , who had famously sued the @entity10 founders			1
even though @entity63 and @entity51 ‘ are among the only people on earth i might describe as real antagonists in my life or even enemies , ’ @entity9 said he went up and introduced himself to them			1
‘ in spite of our tangled history , i had never actually met them ; we only communicated through lawyers			2
my first instinct was that i quite obviously needed to introduce myself and start with hugs			0
‘ they had just arrived so i was n’t sure how they ’d react , but they were very gracious at the time and i knew they ’d understand more deeply by the time they left			0
' almost immediately when i got back , i had a @entity10 friend request from @entity63 and we started a thread mutually extolling the virtues of the festival			2
each night at the @entity5 festival another art installation is set on fire , on saturday night it was the turn of the man ' in no uncertain terms , he described a spiritual awakening			2
i had created all kinds of dark fantasies about how meeting them would go ( @entity63 assures me it would have been cordial regardless ) , but on playa it was laughably clear			0
there , we were all part of the same community			0
we were always part of the same community			0
' renewed by ‘ a deep appreciation of the fully connected and mutually supportive community , ’ @entity9 went on to encourages more ‘ entrepreneur invaders ’ to experience the event			2
‘ when i hear about anyone going for the first time , my immediate thought is “ that is so great for them ” and when they are a person who has pooled power or capital around them , it is usually followed by “ that is so great for the world			2
” ’ the joke in @entity118 is that last week was the worst time possible for starts - ups to fund - raise because all the venture capitalists and leaders from the tech world had gone to the @entity16 desert to experience the @entity5 festival			1
this year 's event was the largest ever with a capacity crowd of 68,000 people from all over the world - and a substantial number of tech billionaires the week - long art , music and everything - else festival where each night is capped by the torching of elaborate large wooden sculptures was celebrating its 27th year and ended on @entity137			0
once seen as the bastion of counter-culture a common criticism leveled at the event in recent years is that it has blanded out and become overrun with too many business - minded from the tech industry			0
in the past @entity149 founders @entity148 and @entity150 have attended and so too has their ceo @entity147 , in fact they ’ve joked that that 's how he got the job in the first place , reports @entity154			0
@entity156 ’s @entity155 is another billionaire who enjoys the party in the @entity30 , some 120 miles north of @entity158			0
as well as a sizable number of tech billionaires , this year ’s event was also attended by celebrities including @entity162 and @entity164 's ex-girlfriend @entity163 who have both described going as a ‘ life changing experience , ’ while former @entity169 supreme commander @entity168 was also ' spotted ' at the festival			0
