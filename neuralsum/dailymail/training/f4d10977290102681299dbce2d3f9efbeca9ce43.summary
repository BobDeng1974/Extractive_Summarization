by @entity0 buried deep beneath the world 's oceans and seas is a vast network of cables that connects the modern world			1
each year it grows to accommodate our increasing dependence on the internet , and now an interactive map has plotted its blood vessel - like expansion over the last 25 years			1
built by @entity16 - based @entity15 , and based on data from @entity18 , the map plots the development of 5,561,268 miles ( 8,949,994 km ) of underwater cable			1
it begins with @entity24 - @entity23 line in 1989 that stretches 96 miles ( 155km ) from @entity26 to @entity27 , and ends with the 9,260 mile - long ( 14,903km ) @entity29 @entity28 , expected to launch towards the end of 2016			1
click below to use the interactive map built by @entity16 - based @entity15 , and based on data from @entity18 , the map ( pictured ) plots the development of 5,561,268 miles ( 8,949,994 km ) of underwater cable			1
it begins with @entity24 - @entity23 line in 1989 that stretches 96 miles ( 155km ) from @entity26 to @entity27 , and ends with the 9,260 mile - long ( 14,903km ) @entity29 @entity28 , expected to launch towards the end of 2016 a submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the sea bed between land - based stations			1
it is laid by specially designed ships that can carry thousands of miles of coiled cable in their holds and can lay it as it travels across the ocean			1
the first commercial cables were laid in 1850 to send telegraphy traffic			2
since then the cables have been used to send telephone traffic , and most recently data traffic			2
many of the modern cables are made of fibre optic			2
trial cables were laid in 1842 in @entity57 harbour and were insulated with tarred hemp and rubber			2
nowadays , cables are protected using polyethylene			2
traditionally the cables were owned by service providers , yet websites have also started buying submarine cables to control their networks including @entity67 and @entity68			1
almost 95 per cent of the internet we use everyday is carried between countries through these fragile two - inch ( 50mm ) thick lines			0
in 2006 , submarine cables carried just one per cent of traffic - an increase of 94 per cent in just eight years , according to official figures from the @entity78			1
since 2012 , the number of submarine cables have almost doubled from 150 to 285			0
of this 285 , 263 cables are currently in use , while 22 are set to be in use by the end of 2015			1
when a cable is laid but not in use it is called a ' dark ' cable , but once in use it becomes ' lit '			0
by 2017 , the @entity15 map reveals this number is expected to rise to 849			1
cables on the map can be filtered by year , country and cable operator , which includes @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity95			1
it shows active and planned submarine cable systems and their landing stations			0
selecting a cable on the map , or from the submarine cable list , reveals details of the cable ’s name , ready - for - service ( @entity106 ) date , length , owners , website , and landing points			1
a submarine communications cable is laid on the sea bed between land - based stations			1
it is laid by specially designed ships that can carry thousands of miles of coiled cable in their holds and can lay it as it travels across the ocean			1
there is only a limited amount of space for cable on land , and this makes the space expensive to rent , and highly competitive			0
since 1850 engineers and telecom companies , instead , have been taking advantage of the vast land beneath the oceans to lay cables			1
the first cables were used to send telegraphy traffic			0
since then the cables have been used to send telephone traffic , and most recently data traffic			0
this animation shows how the cable network grew rapidly between 1997 and 2003			0
the first commercial cables were laid in 1850 to send telegraphy traffic			0
since then the cables have been used to send telephone traffic , and most recently data traffic			0
many of the modern cables are made of fibre optic by 2017 , the map reveals that the number of cables is expected to rise to 849			1
cables on the map can be filtered by year , country and cable operator , which includes @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity95			1
this image shows that by 2017 , @entity67 will have built 11 cables stretching 61,727 miles ( 99,340 km )			1
the map shows active and planned submarine cable systems and their landing stations the longest cable is called @entity162 or @entity165 - @entity164 - @entity163 3			1
it has 39 landing points ( the average network has between 10 and 15 ) across @entity163 , @entity165 and @entity169			0
it covers 24,000 miles and is run by @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173			0
the @entity174 is the shortest and connects the islands of @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 near @entity180			0
it covers 425 miles ( 685km ) in the @entity182 and is owned by @entity183			0
the total network covers in excess of 550,000 miles			2
in 2006 , submarine cables carried just one per cent of traffic , they now account for around 95 per cent			0
there are now 285 cables - 263 are in service and 22 are due to be in use by 2015			2
many of the modern cables are made of fibre optic , to increase the size and speed at which the information can be sent , and are only two inches ( 50mm ) thick			2
trial cables were laid in 1842 in @entity57 harbour and were insulated with tarred hemp and rubber			0
nowadays , cables are protected using polyethylene			0
traditionally the cables were owned by service providers , yet websites have also started buying submarine cables to control their networks			0
for example , @entity67 is part of the consortium that manages the @entity165 - @entity213 cable , and @entity68 is part of the consortium that manages the @entity216			1
reports in december stated that by owning private networks these companies can stop governments from being able to track what they get up to			0
back in the 1970s , @entity223 was thought to have been the first underwater cable - tapping operation			2
it took place when copper wires , which radiate electromagnetic energy , were used to relay relatively small amounts of data that could be intercepted by fitting a recording device around the cable			0
' at the time , the @entity233 were so confident in the security of their line they left it completely unencrypted , enabling @entity238 intelligence teams to simply record the transmissions , extract them from the seabed and listen to them at the end of each month , ' explained @entity242			2
in modern cable systems , fibre optic cables use photons to transfer data			2
modern tapping can be accomplished in one of two ways - either by splicing the cable and splitting the photon stream with a prism , or by bending the cable to a point where it begins to leak data			2
' the documents leaked to @entity257 by @entity258 in 2012 revealed how @entity24 and @entity238 intelligence agencies had tapped more than 200 of these cables as part of an ongoing mass - collection spying project launched in 2008 , completely undermining the privacy of ordinary citizens across the world , ' continued @entity242			1
as of 2010 , submarine cables link all the world 's continents except @entity269			1
@entity169 was the last major region of the globe to connect to high - speed broadband , with the launch of @entity274 ’s subsea cable system in 2009			1
cables can be broken by fishing trawlers , anchors , earthquakes , turbidity currents , and even shark bites			0
if cables need to fixed , a repair ship will drop a buoy in the location of the break and a submersible is sent down to repair them			0
selecting a cable on the map ( pictured ) or from the submarine cable list , reveals details of the cable 's name , ready - for - service ( @entity106 ) date , length , owners , website , and landing points			1

this map shows how the @entity327 's network looked in 1901			2
in 2006 , submarine cables carried just one per cent of traffic , this figure is now around 95 per cent the cable system between @entity332 , @entity333 and the islands of @entity335 and @entity336 in the @entity238 experienced 45 faults over a 15 - year period between 1990 and 2005 , becoming known as the world ’s worst performing system			1
most of the faults were abrasions caused by tidal currents rubbing the cable across the rough and rocky sea bed			0
ship ’s anchors and fishing trawlers also caused their share of damage , hooking cables that were suspended above the sea bed			0
some faults were also said to have been caused by repairs made on other parts of the cable			0
in december 2006 , communications across @entity165 were severed when the @entity359 earthquake knocked out 80 per cent of the cables connecting @entity361 with the rest of the world			2
the breakages took out half of @entity367 ’s internet capacity and cut @entity369 ’s access to foreign websites			0
this image shows a cross section of a modern submarine communications cable			0
it is around two inches ( 50mm ) thick			0
the labels are : ( 1 ) @entity376 , ( 2 ) mylar tape , ( 3 ) stranded steel wires , ( 4 ) aluminium water barrier , ( 5 ) @entity380 , ( 6 ) copper or aluminium tube , ( 7 ) @entity383 and ( 8 ) optical fibres			0

the interactive map was built by @entity16 - based @entity15 , based on information from @entity388 's @entity18
it plots the growth of 5,561,268 miles ( 8,949,994 km ) of cable starting with the @entity24 - @entity23 line in 1989
the growth ends with the @entity29 @entity28 , expected to launch towards the end of 2016
in total , the map *consists* of 849 cables stretching under the world 's seas and oceans
cables can be filtered by year , country and cable operator , which includes @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity95
