more than 4,000 nurseries are failing to provide a good standard of care and education - and must improve within two years or face closure			1
one in six nurseries and pre-schools - catering for about 150,000 babies and toddlers - need to make improvements , according to education watchdog @entity9			1
concerns range from poor standards of early education to unsafe premises , gaps in first aid training and staff smoking on the premises			1
more than 4,000 nurseries are failing to provide a good standard of care and education , says @entity9 following an overhaul of inspections , all childcare providers on ‘ non-domestic premises ’ – such as nurseries and pre-schools – are expected to achieve a ‘ good ’ rating from @entity9			1
those falling short of the benchmark will be given up to two years to shape up or face being labelled as ‘ inadequate ’ , raising the prospect of being de-registered or closed			1
it was originally proposed that under - performing providers would be given four years to improve , but the turnaround period was halved amid claims the plan was too lenient			2
the new inspection regime – which came into force in autumn last year - also scrutinises standards of early education more closely as well as the progress made by children and their readiness for starting school at four			0
one in six nurseries and pre-schools ( not pictured ) need to make improvements according to watchdog figures released by @entity9 yesterday show that 17 per cent of 23,551 nurseries and other non-domestic providers are currently falling below the ‘ good ’ benchmark			1
among childminders , the figure is higher , at 23 per cent , although a separate system is used for inspecting and monitoring childminders who require improvement			0
many of the country ’s 65,704 registered early years providers were checked under previous inspection blueprints			2
of those visited over the three - month period from april to june this year – the most recent inspection period to incorporate the tough new standards – 28 per cent of nurseries and 23 per cent of childminders were judged to require improvement			0
of 4,177 providers inspected , 423 were ordered to make improvements to early education programmes			1
some 52 were found to be operating in unsafe premises while 105 needed to improve their safeguarding practices			1
a total of 47 were censured over first aid training for staff and two for staff smoking rules			1
twenty - six per cent overall were found to require improvement but early years leaders hailed a big improvement on the previous quarter , when 32 per cent were judged to be substandard			0
@entity78 , chief executive of the @entity79 , said : ‘ we are pleased to see such a significant increase in the number of ‘ good ’ and ‘ outstanding ’ providers			0
‘ these figures clearly demonstrate that , despite ongoing funding shortfalls and diminished local authority support , the vast majority of early years providers continue to deliver consistently high - quality learning opportunities to the children in their care			2
’ but he added : ‘ we continue to receive concerns from providers about the conduct of early years inspectors , and the serious questions that have been asked about the fairness and consistency of the inspection process have yet to be adequately answered			2
’ last year the then education minister @entity102 warned that some ‘ chaotic ’ pre-schools allow children to do what they want for most of the day , leaving them unable to sit still and listen by the time they get to primary school			0
she said some nurseries were filled with young children ‘ running around with no sense of purpose ’			0
an @entity9 spokesman said yesterday : ‘ it is now almost a year since we raised standards for nurseries and other early years providers			1
so it is heartening that these statistics show that almost three - quarters of our inspections found a good or outstanding service for young children			0
‘ parents can be assured that young children at those provisions are in an environment where they can learn and develop			0
‘ however , there are still too many early years provisions which do not help young children be ready to learn when they start school			0
in coming months @entity9 will be working with the providers which need to improve			2

more than 4,000 nurseries are failing to provide a good standard of care
one in six needs to make improvements , according to @entity9
those falling short will be given up to two years to shape up
concerns range from unsafe premises to staff smoking on site
