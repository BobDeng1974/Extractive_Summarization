we 've been waiting more than two decades for the iconic hoverboard from @entity2 to become a reality , and finally it 's arrived - perfectly on cue			2
it 's the year 2015 when @entity6 and @entity7 are awestruck by the amazing futuristic skateboard in the film classic - but what they could n't have predicted in 1989 is that the hoverboard would be so much more than offer a nifty ( yet rather dangerous ) way to zip around town			2
it would also hold the secret to having a core of steel - and , officially called the drift , be one of 2015 's hottest new fitness gadgets			1
after hearing people complain about their achy calves after snow boarding , they realised the key to minimising pain was improving balance			2
unfortunately the gadget is n't quite as futuristic as @entity6 's and a peek underneath reveals an adjustable ball - and - pendulum balancing mechanism			2
according to the brand 's spokesman : ' this allows for a unique range of motion while its moving roller - arm lets the rider rock , roll and pivot			2
' drift simulates a variety of action sports which they say helps strengthen the core , improve balance , burn calories , and increase lower body strength			1
those clever people at @entity63 say 30 minutes on the board is equivalent to an hour snowboarding or surfing			1
thirty minutes on the hoverboard - style drift gadget is equivalent to an hour snowboarding or surfing drift simulates a variety of action sports which helps strengthen the core , improve balance and burn calories the drift , which retails here at £ 149.99 , has already been in a hit in @entity79 and has just started hitting gyms in the the @entity81			1
according to personal trainer @entity83 , the device could improve both balance and core stability : ' i would say both those are key aspects of health and fitness			1
' core stability is important in all sport - except perhaps darts			0
' we use the hips as the main driver for most sports and this would directly tie into the driver of your hips			1
it could also help with coordination			0
' in terms of burning calories , there are more effective ways of going about it			0
your traditional treadmill or high - intensity interval training , for example , both have higher calorie burning ability			0
futuristic ? an adjustable ball - and - pendulum balancing mechanism allows for a unique range of motion ' core work will improve strength but wo n't give you a superficial six pack			0
having good core stability is not usually hugely visible but will enable you to be fitter			0
' @entity121 advises integrating the device into a fitness programme			1
' it could be a good add - on to a regime , but not a stand alone workout , ' he says			0
' unfortunately that ten minute workout that does everything has n’t yet been developed - and probably never will			0
' here 's hoping there are some budding docs out there who will prove the experts wrong			0
quirky drift is available in the @entity81 for £ 149.99 at 2tech			1
