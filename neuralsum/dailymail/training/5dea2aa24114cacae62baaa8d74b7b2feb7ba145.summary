by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:41 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 12:11 est , 20 june 2013 a @entity3 council is using the sound of a baby choking to death in a house fire to campaign against government cuts			1
@entity9 has also mocked up a newspaper frontpage reporting the entirely fictitious death of five children in a school in a taxpayer - funded campaign against changes to local fire services			1
the extraordinary marketing campaign , which includes a video of a baby choked by smoke , has been condemned as ‘ beyond tasteless ’ and ‘ downright sick ’			1
a @entity46 video features a collection of children ’s toys on a bookcase as the room gradually fills with smoke			1
in the background a young child can be heard coughing , with the choking sound getting worse as the smoke appears to thicken			1
a caption reads : ‘ the mayor of @entity39 wants to close @entity59			1
this will add 34 seconds to the average response time for firefighters to reach emergencies in @entity24			2
’ a timer starts counting in the corner and when it reaches 13 seconds a toy rabbit falls off the bookcase and the child ’s coughing suddenly stops			2
the council has also produced a shocking mock newspaper front page with the headline : ‘ five children dead in school fire			1
’ it also refers to ' tragedy in @entity44 ' and quotes : ‘ " every minute counts ” says distraught headteacher ’			0
other fictional newspapers report ' @entity81 at old folks home kills 3 ' and ' fire wrecks @entity44 businesses			1
pressure : @entity39 mayor @entity41 has been targeted in the campaign against cuts to the @entity88 the ' story ' reports that the ' community is in mourning for five children who lost their lives to smoke inhalation after becoming trapped in a horrific fire at a school '			1
but none of this happened , and is part of what the council calls ' the headlines we do n’t want to see '			2
the poster was used at a public meeting on monday where up to 90 people were urged to contact a consultation against the closure			0
the conservatives today condemned the scare tactics in the strongest possible terms			2
@entity111 , @entity112 vice-chairman , said : ‘ lambeth council have a bad track record for using council taxpayers money to promote political scare stories , but this is plumbing new depths			2
tasteless : this dramatic - but fictional - newspaper front page has been produced by @entity24 council ‘ to conjure up the idea of the death of children in this way is beyond scaremongering and beyond tasteless			1
’ but @entity24 council was unrepentant , insisting the cuts posed a ‘ very real danger to the public ’ the @entity131 , which is headed by the @entity39 mayor , wants to close 12 fire stations across the capital			2
@entity135 , chairman of the authority said : ' i completely understand people are concerned , but the @entity9 ’s attempts to generate fear amongst its residents are disgusting			2
' these posters are an ill - judged and irresponsible addition to a @entity24 campaign already marred by emotive misinformation			0
' @entity146 and the mayor will listen closely to the views of residents before any final decisions are made			0
' lambeth council says more than 5,500 residents have signed an online petition against the plan to close @entity44 fire station , which serves an area where 16,000 new homes are planned			0
councillor @entity158 , leader of @entity24 council , said : ‘ on monday night at a packed meeting in @entity44 , a firefighter said increased response times will cost lives			1
‘ no other area of @entity39 will suffer more than @entity24 from these proposals which will see the time it takes for a fire engine to reach an emergency rise by four minutes in @entity44 , compared to an extra 16 seconds across @entity39			0
' the posters and film reflect the very real danger to the public of closing @entity44 fire station			0
we believe it 's important that our residents are aware of the proposal to close @entity44 fire station and the dangers to public safety as a result of increased response times			1
’ in april it emerged @entity24 council spent hundreds of pounds of taxpayers ’ money on 50 posters and an online advert opposing @entity188 cuts in welfare			0
the advert , displayed on @entity24 ’s website , featured a giant pair of scissors slicing through a pound sign			0
it read : ‘ the government are making cuts to benefits			0
if you claim benefits , it is likely you will receive less and may have to find work or move to a different property			0
’ it then encouraged claimants to contact the town hall ’s benefits support team who ‘ can help make sure you are getting all you are allowed to claim ’			0
the @entity210 reported the council to the local government ombudsman for the abuse of taxpayers ’ money .			0

@entity9 condemned for tasteless scaremongering
