by @entity0 published : 12:13 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 06:20 est , 10 december 2012 a ‘ pacemaker ’ has been implanted in to the brain of an @entity3 's patient in a bid to reduce memory loss			1
the device , which uses deep brain stimulation , has already been used in thousands of people with @entity10 as possible means of boosting memory and reversing cognitive decline			1
now the first patient in the @entity15 has undergone the delicate surgery to try and halt the effects of dementia , which slowly robs its mostly elderly victims of a lifetime of memories and the ability to perform the simplest of daily tasks			0
a diseased brain - showing the effects of dementia			2
the new device appears to keep brain neurons active and help prevent cognitive decline instead of focusing on drug treatments , many of which have failed in recent clinical trials , the researchers at the @entity31 are looking at the use of the low - voltage electrical charges delivered directly to the brain			1
as part of a preliminary safety study in 2010 , the devices were implanted in six @entity3 ’s patients in @entity42			0
the trial showed that patients with mild forms of the disorder showed sustained increases in glucose metabolism - an indicator that brain neurons are working - over a 13 - month period			1
most alzheimer ’s disease patients show decreases in glucose metabolism over the same period			2
@entity55 , associate professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the @entity31 , said : ' recent failures in @entity3 ’s disease trials using drugs such as those designed to reduce the build - up of " plaques " in the brain have sharpened the need for alternative strategies			1
' this is a very different approach , whereby we are trying to enhance the function of the brain mechanically			2
it ’s a whole new avenue for potential treatment for a disease becoming all the more common with the aging of the population			0
' some 40 dementia patients in the @entity15 are expected to receive the deep brain stimulation implant over the next year ( posed by model ) some 40 patients are expected to receive the deep brain stimulation implant over the next year or so at @entity79 and four other institutions in the @entity15 the procedure involves drilling holes into the skull to implant wires into the fornix on either side of the brain			2
the fornix is a brain pathway instrumental in bringing information to the hippocampus , the portion of the brain where learning begins and memories are made , and where the earliest symptoms of @entity3 ’s appear to arise			0
the wires are attached to a pacemaker - like device , the ' stimulator , ' which generates tiny electrical impulses into the brain 130 times a second			1
the patients do n’t feel the current , said dr @entity55			0
for the trial , all of the patients will be implanted with the devices			0
half will have their stimulators turned on two weeks after surgery , while the other half will have their stimulators turned on after one year			0
neither the patients nor the doctors treating them will know which group gets an early or later start			0
' deep brain stimulation might prove to be a useful mechanism for treating alzheimer ’s disease , or it might help us develop less invasive treatments based on the same mechanism , ' said dr @entity55			1
by 2050 , the number of people age 65 and older with alzheimer ’s disease may triple , experts say , from 5.2 million to a projected 11 million to 16 million , unless effective treatments are found .			1

device already used in people with @entity10 as possible means reversing cognitive decline
early trials show the device appears to keep brain neurons active
high hopes will be *viable* alternative to drug treatments
