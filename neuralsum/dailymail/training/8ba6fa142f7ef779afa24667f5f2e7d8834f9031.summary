by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:08 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 07:46 est , 30 january 2014 @entity3 today claimed the small print of @entity6 's economic plan , including an extra £ 25billion in borrowing , poses the ' single biggest risk to the economic recovery '			1
the chancellor today challenged @entity6 's @entity11 over the careful wording of his promise to run a surplus which only applies to day - to - day spending			1
in a letter to mr @entity11 , seen by @entity1 , mr @entity3 demanded to know how higher spending and more borrowing forever can be described as ' fiscal discipline '			1
clash : @entity11 has been challenged by chancellor @entity3 over his plans to borrow more money if @entity6 wins the next election in a major speech at the weekend , mr @entity11 insisted he would ‘ ’ make sure the sums add up ’ and warned @entity6 ‘ can not and will not duck the hard choices ahead ’			1
he declared : ‘ the next @entity6 government will balance the books and deliver a surplus on the current budget and falling national debt in the next @entity33			1
’ by contrast , @entity35 chancellor @entity3 has promised to balance the books on the ‘ overall budget ’ , ensuring that money raised from taxes exceeds all government spending			1
mr @entity3 said in september : ‘ we will have a surplus in good times as insurance against difficult times ahead			2
‘ provided the recovery is sustained , our goal is to achieve that surplus in the next @entity33			0
that will bear down on our debts and prepare us for the next rainy day			0
’ analysis by the respected @entity52 ( @entity52 ) think tank says the subtle difference means mr balls ’ promise only covers day - to - day spending , and would allow @entity6 to make fewer spending cuts and borrow almost £ 25billion more			1
it clears the way for billions more spending on infrastructure and housing projects , which the @entity64 seized on as proof @entity6 is not serious about getting a grip on the nation ’s finances			1
in his letter , mr @entity3 writes : ' as with all your announcements , the small print tells a very different story			0
' he said that it is ' vital that our political debate is based on the facts ' and demanded to called on him to ' confirm that you plan to borrow at least £ 25 billion a year indefinitely '			0
mr @entity3 added : ' in what way does a policy of ‘ significantly higher spending ’ and budget deficits forever constitute fiscal discipline ? ' our long term economic plan is delivering growth and economic security for hardworking people			1
despite your recent attempts to rebuild a reputation for fiscal responsibility , the truth that was buried in the small print is now clear : the @entity6 is the single biggest risk to the economic recovery			0
' the @entity96 predicts that a future @entity35 government would need to cut an extra £ 37.6 billion between 2016 and 2019 to balance the books on the overall budget			2
however @entity6 would only need to cut £ 13billion to stick to its new rules – a difference of £ 24.6billion			1
the @entity64 said the revelation was rppof that mr @entity11 and @entity6 leader @entity103 would order ' more spending , more borrowing and more taxes ' @entity11 has been accused of being ' in denial ' after claiming levels of public spending before the financial crisis were not a problem			1
@entity112 has seized on the remarks as proof @entity6 has failed to learn the lessons of running a large deficit before the crash			0
in an interview on sunday , mr @entity11 said : ' do i think the level of public spending going into the crisis was a problem for @entity123 ? no , i do n’t , nor our deficit , nor our national debt – what happened was a global financial crisis which pushed up the deficit			0
' in the @entity130 mr @entity112 said @entity6 just wanted to go back to spending more money			2
' we were talking earlier about our children			0
when our children in future turn to the dictionary and look up the definition of denial it 'll be right there - balls , @entity141 , ' the @entity133 said			0
@entity143 , of the @entity52 , told @entity144 : ‘ while @entity11 and @entity3 have made rather similar sounding commitments to achieving a surplus in the next @entity33 , their targets are actually very different			2
‘ @entity11 ’s commitment to achieve a surplus on the current budget would allow significantly higher spending on both investment and day - to - day items than would @entity3 ’s plan			1
‘ the difference is that @entity3 plans for tax revenues to be sufficient to cover both day - to - day and investment spending , rather than just day - to - day spending as @entity11 wants			1
’ @entity35 mp @entity158 , a member of the treasury select committee , said : ‘ it ’s no surprise that @entity11 has a credibility problem on the economy when an announcement designed to convince the public they can trust him uses a sleight of hand to give himself a £ 25 billion leeway			0
’ a @entity35 spokesman said : ‘ @entity6 spent , borrowed and taxed our country into a mess			0
‘ and now @entity103 and @entity11 are proposing yet more spending , more borrowing and more taxes			0
it 's the same old @entity6			2
they have no long - term economic plan			0
and that would mean a less secure future for our country and for hardworking people and their families			0
’ a @entity6 spokesperson said : ‘ as we said last week @entity6 will deliver a surplus on the current budget and falling national debt as soon as possible in the next @entity33			1
this will require spending cuts , action to deliver stronger growth and fairer choices including reversing @entity112 's huge tax cut for millionaires			2
‘ the @entity64 are criticising the same measure of the deficit that @entity3 is himself targeting in this @entity33			1
but @entity3 has failed to balance the books as he promised because he choked off the recovery and flatlined our economy for 3 years			2
’ prime minister @entity112 refused to rule out cutting the top rate of tax from 45p @entity112 has refused to rule out reducing the top rate of tax to 40p			0
labour leader @entity103 asked three times about whether a planned cut of the 45p rate is being lined up by the government , as he probed the prime minister on his proposals for workers who earn more than £ 150,000 a year			0
but mr @entity112 chose to focus on the government 's existing policies , adding that the richest people would pay more in income tax in every year under the coalition government when compared with the previous @entity6 administration			2
@entity6 has promised to return the rate to 50p if it wins the election , even though experts say it will raise hardly any extra money to tackle the deficit			2
in the @entity130 mr @entity103 said mr @entity112 used to claim ' that the 50p tax rate was a symbol of us all being in it together and now it 's gone '			0
the @entity6 leader added : ' now could you tell us whether you rule out cutting the top rate further to 40p ? ' but mr @entity112 side - stepped the question , insisting chancellor @entity3 had set out the government 's priorities yesterday , adding : ' we want to cut taxes for the lowest paid and for middle - income people			1

*shadow* chancellor 's pledge only covers day - to - day spending
@entity3 promised to run a surplus on the overall budget
it means @entity64 will cut £ 37.6bn while @entity6 would only need to cut £ 13bn
