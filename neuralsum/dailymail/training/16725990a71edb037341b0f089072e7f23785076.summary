@entity0 was again happy to cast himself in the role of his hero @entity2 , raising the possibility of infamy repeating itself on the typhoon - threatened @entity6 track on sunday			1
it was here , unforgettably , that the rivalry of @entity2 and @entity10 reached its nasty zenith with collisions in their title fights of 1989 and 1990			1
i ’m pretty sure everyone has been through an experience like that , and if they have n’t , good for them			2
‘ if someone does you wrong , you feel like going all out on them			2
it could be from a relationship , where you ’ve got a girl and some dude comes and messes with your chick , and you want to kill that dude			1
it ’s the same kind of thing			2
the same kind of injustice			2
’ the analogy may have been a bit @entity56 in its argot , a bit ill - judged in its tone			2
but it was hardly stranger than his remarks about the vagaries of ill - luck			0
‘ it ’s like @entity67 , ’ he said			0
‘ you ca n’t do anything about what she decides			0
’ a collision at @entity6 in 1989 between @entity28 team - mates @entity10 and @entity2 had handed the world title to @entity10			1
the following year , at the same circuit , @entity2 claimed pole but was enraged when his appeal to switch to the cleaner side of the track was rejected			1
he vowed that if @entity10 — now driving for @entity79 and the only man who could beat @entity2 to the crown — gained the advantage into the first corner , @entity2 would try to take the lead regardless of the consequences			1
the two duly came together at the first corner , sending both off the track			0
the crash meant that @entity2 had clinched the drivers ’ championship for @entity28 for a second time			1
given that the @entity93 sister helped the poor of @entity95 rather than determined the fates of racing drivers , it can only be assumed he meant @entity98 , whose reach purportedly extends far beyond the @entity100 subcontinent			0
returning to @entity101 , @entity0 said : ‘ i think @entity2 had a sheer belief that something was his			1
’ @entity0 was excusing @entity2 ’s actions here in this bleak town in the @entity106 — taking @entity10 out on the first lap in 1990 — on the basis that the @entity109 was merely avenging the @entity29 crashing into him towards the end of the previous title decider			1
@entity2 's feud with @entity27 came to boiling point at @entity6 in 1989 , where the @entity109 came off second best after a collision the collision in @entity6 handed prost the title in 1989 @entity0 heads into the weekend three points clear of teammate and rival @entity14 there are concerns about whether the @entity21 @entity23 will even take place due to the arrival of @entity125 @entity0 was aged only four and five on those occasions , but he claims to remember the two incidents			1
they are probably patched into his memory by the recent @entity2 movie that charts what are probably the two most memorable moments in motor - racing history			1
‘ it was a cool period of time in @entity134 , ’ he said			0
‘ i had just started watching at that time with my dad			0
when i watch it back nowadays , the second crash , that was cool			0
with the other one it ’s very hard to call who was right or wrong when they were at the chicane			0
it was n’t black and white			0
‘ i ’ve always felt like i could relate or had a good connection with @entity2			1
he was always my favourite driver			0
i have felt a lot of things in my life that i think he may have felt			0
i related to him more than any other driver			0
’ the similarities between the @entity101 era and @entity0 - @entity14 is helped by the @entity150 ’s thoughtful manner , which makes him a latter - day ‘ professor ’ @entity27			1
@entity14 has made no promise to punt @entity0 off here , saying only : ‘ it ’s nice to hear comparisons like those because they are two of the greats			1
but personally i feel it ’s a completely different battle			0
’ it is still a scrap for which any petrolhead would willingly set his alarm at 7.50am for an advertised start 10 minutes later in the dawn of your @entity168 sabbath			0
but , be warned , you may not be tuning into the race but into a typhoon , waffling pundits or simply a package of highlights			1
@entity2 and @entity10 as teammates in november 1988 before the @entity177 @entity23 there is talk about a possible swap of teams between @entity79 's @entity182 ( right ) and @entity184 @entity183 ( left ) the @entity6 track , which @entity0 and @entity14 will compete on if the @entity23 goes ahead there is no certainty that the @entity21 @entity23 will actually take place because of @entity125 ’s expected arrival			1
organisers spent friday exchanging emails containing data from various meteorological authorities			2
they are delaying a decision on whether to shift the start of the race but , as of last night , said they were ‘ 95 per cent certain ’ it would be staged as scheduled			2
what is really putting the wind up @entity134 people is that the next race is a week sunday , 5,000 miles away in @entity204			2
getting the freight out on monday , when the typhoon is most widely tipped to hit town , will be extremely hard			0
a storm was also brewing along the paddock concerning @entity182 and his future at @entity79			0
the growing feeling is that the @entity213 will leave at the end of the season , with his destination unknown			0
a swap deal with @entity183 ? go to @entity28 , where he would probably force @entity220 ’s departure and be made outright no 1 ? wait for any fallout at @entity222 ? take a year off ?			1
