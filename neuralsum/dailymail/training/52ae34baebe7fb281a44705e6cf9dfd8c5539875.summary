@entity6 's have ants and other insects to thank for some of @entity5 's messiest garbage disposal , researchers have found			1
the discovered that insects on a single stretch of road consumed more than 2,100 pounds of discarded junk food , the equivalent of 60,000 hot dogs			1
they say the study shows just how important insects are to cities			2
the team discovered that on one stretch of @entity20 insects consumed more than 2,100 pounds of discarded junk food , the equivalent of 60,000 hot dogs			1
to see how much the arthropods ate , the researchers put out carefully measured amounts of junk food - potato chips , cookies and hot dogs - at sites in street medians and city parks			1
researchers placed two sets of food at each site			2
one set was placed in a cage , so only arthropods could reach the food ; the second set was placed in the open , where other animals could also eat it			0
after 24 hours , the scientists collected the food to see how much was eaten			0
the new study from @entity45 shows that arthropods - ants , millipedes , mites , spiders and others - play a significant role in disposing of garbage on the streets of @entity5			1
' we calculate that the arthropods on medians down the @entity20 / west st. corridor alone could consume more than 2,100 pounds of discarded junk food , the equivalent of 60,000 hot dogs , every year - assuming they take a break in the winter , ' says dr. @entity64 , a research associate at @entity45 and lead author of a paper on the work			1
' this is n't just a silly fact , ' @entity64 explains			0
' this highlights a very real service that these arthropods provide			0
' they effectively dispose of our trash for us			0
' during the summer of 2013 , the researchers working in parks and on streets in @entity5 measured temperature and humidity and sampled the population of arthropods			2
they also sifted through the leaf litter and sucked ants into an aspirator by hand			0
they extracted 16,294 bugs , including representatives of 32 species of ants			1

the researchers were in the midst of a long - term study of urban insects when @entity117 struck @entity6 in 2012			2
in spring 2013 , they expanded their study to look at whether @entity117 had affected the behaviour of these insect populations			0
to see how much the arthropods ate , the researchers put out carefully measured amounts of junk food - potato chips , cookies and hot dogs - at sites in street medians and city parks			1
the researchers found that @entity117 had no measurable impact on food consumption by arthropod populations in @entity6 , which was somewhat surprising since many of the study sites had been flooded with brackish water			2
the bigger surprise was that arthropod populations in medians ate two to three times more junk food than those in parks - even though there was less biodiversity in the medians			1
' we think this is because one of the most common species in the medians was the pavement ant ( @entity148 species ) , which is a particularly efficient forager in urban environments , ' @entity64 says			0
in addition , by comparing food consumption inside and outside of the sample cages , the researchers showed that other animals - such as rats and pigeons - were also eating the junk food			1
' this means that ants and rats are competing to eat human garbage , and whatever the ants eat is n't available for the rats , ' @entity64 explains			0
' the ants are n't just helping to clean up our cities , but to limit populations of rats and other pests			0

researchers studied the @entity20 / west st. corridor in @entity5
insects consumed more than 2,100 pounds of discarded junk food
also found 16,294 bugs , including representatives of 32 species of ants
