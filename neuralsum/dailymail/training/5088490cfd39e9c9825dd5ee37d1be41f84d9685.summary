earlier today it was reported that @entity1 could be heading for a winter strewn with power cuts as an extreme cold snap heads the country ’s way			0
but one company has a solution to at least let you see clearly during an outage with a light bulb that uses a battery to keep itself on			2
in the event of a power cut it will automatically switch to battery power to keep shining for up to three hours , during which time one would hope the power had returned			1
called @entity24 ( shown ) it has an in - built battery that lasts for up to three hours			1
it charges when power is up and the light is on as normal			2
but when the power goes it automatically switches to battery mode the product is called @entity32 and uses technology invented by @entity20 in @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity21			1
‘ @entity32 automatic switching has the single aim of ensuring that users are not left in the dark should the electricity supply fail , ’ the company writes on their website			0
today experts warned that @entity1 must brace itself for power shortages if the country is hit by a severe winter			0
after a rush to close coal - fired power stations to meet green targets , a deep freeze means mothballed oil and gas power stations could have to be restarted and factories paid to shut down to preserve power			0
business leaders warned that for too long , the @entity1 has failed to plan properly to keep the lights on , as the @entity56 revealed the average gap between supply and demand will be just 4.1 per cent - the narrowest in eight years			0
the @entity56 report said the country will be eating into its most basic reserve power if there is extreme weather			0
the appliance operates similarly to existing light bulbs until it detects the power is gone , when it automatically switches to battery operation			1
this enables it to stay on independently for up to three hours until the power returns			0
and it can also distinguish between a power cut and someone just flicking the light switch , so people will easily be able to turn it off if needed			1
the @entity79 battery charges automatically when the power is up and the builb is on as normal			2
and no additional wiring is required - the bulb can be screwed straight into an existing fitting like a regular bulb			1
it ’s also energy friendly , consuming just eight watts of power , but it shines with the brightness of a regular 60 - watt bulb - measured as 850 lumens to 800 lumens for the latter			1
the company expects to begin selling the light bulb at the end of the year , but there ’s no word yet on how much it will cost			2
' this innovative new product is set to take its place among other " standard " safety products within the home such as smoke detectors , @entity104 detectors and intruder alarms , ' the company adds			0
