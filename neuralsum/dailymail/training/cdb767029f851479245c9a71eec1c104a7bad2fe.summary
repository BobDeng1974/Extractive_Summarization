@entity1 will reduce @entity2 to an economic basket case like @entity4 if it wins the election , a leading investment bank warned last night			1
analysts at @entity7 ( @entity7 ) said it would lead to lower growth , and seriously damage investor confidence in the @entity2			1
in a devastating assessment , the world ’s fourth - largest investment bank told clients that under a weak @entity16 government , possibly propped up by the @entity17 and @entity18 , the @entity2 would ‘ look increasingly like @entity4 ’ , where growth is almost non-existent and unemployment is almost double the level in the @entity2			1
labour leader @entity16 , pictured would turn the @entity2 into an economic basket - case like @entity4 @entity7 @entity23 warned that a @entity16 premiership would likely be weak the report said : ‘ a left - wing coalition around @entity1 , would , in our view , continue to deliver on fiscal austerity , albeit a milder version than the @entity31 , with the accompanying cyclical headwind that this entails , while embarking on structural changes which could in the medium run reduce the appeal of the @entity2 as a business location and trigger , ultimately , a deterioration in potential gdp growth			1
‘ in a nutshell , the @entity2 would look increasingly like @entity4			2
’ the warning is acutely embarrassing for mr @entity16 , who cosied up to @entity4 ’s socialist president @entity42 after his 2012 victory			0
at the time , mr @entity16 said the two men were ‘ in agreement ’ on the economy , and suggested he was looking to replicate the @entity4 anti-austerity programme			0
but mr @entity42 ’s socialist experiment , which included a 75 per cent top tax rate , has proved a disaster			0
economic growth in the final quarter was 0.1 per cent in @entity4 , compared with 0.5 per cent in the @entity2			1
unemployment is 9.9 per cent – way above the 5.8 per cent in the @entity2			0
the @entity7 report warned that mr @entity16 is likely to ‘ seriously interfere with the private sector ’ , adding that , with the public finances still in a mess , @entity1 may revert to bashing business in order to fund its pledges			1
@entity63 chairman @entity62 said the report showed the danger posed by the @entity1 ‘ if a centre - left government can not tackle inequality through social transfers , it will be tempted to focus on fighting “ primary inequality ” , for instance by imposing a massive increase in the minimum wage , ’ said the report			2
‘ in our estimates , @entity1 ’s pledge to bring this to £ 8 per hour would put the @entity2 at the level where @entity4 is , in terms of distance from the median wage			1
‘ re-regulation of working contracts and working time would also be likely			0
the “ energy price freeze ” – mooted by @entity1 last year – and the proposals to introduce a market share cap in the banking sector are other examples of interference with the private sector			0
’ @entity63 chairman @entity62 said the report underlined the threat posed by @entity1			0
‘ @entity1 have no plan for the economy , other than more spending , more borrowing and more taxes , ’ he said			0
‘ the choice is clear – between a competent @entity63 government working through its long - term economic plan and the chaos of @entity1 with @entity16 and @entity103			2

@entity1 would turn @entity2 into an economic basket case like @entity4
a report by @entity7 said bankers were *worried*
