did @entity0 really get a standing ovation from @entity3 fans after doing the square root of nothing for 71 minutes against @entity6 on saturday evening ? i thought players had to earn that kind of reaction , not just turn up and wear the shirt			1
@entity3 fans have rightly given standing ovations to some very special and hard - working players in the past			1
these supporters traditionally know their stuff , they demand a lot before giving their seal of approval			0
@entity0 received an unwarranted standing ovation when subbed off on his @entity3 home debut @entity0 was replaced by @entity22 with 19 minutes remaining as @entity3 trailed 1 - 0 @entity0 was largely anonymous as @entity3 slipped to defeat against @entity6 yet @entity0 has turned up , said the right things to get the fans onside , shown a bit of swagger but not a lot of quality , and the @entity30 faithful seem to be happy with that			1
should n’t you lot be demanding more ? if the message to @entity0 from the fans is that saturday ’s effort ( or lack of it ) is enough to keep them happy , then why would he demand more from himself ? i ’m all for supporting and encouraging a player , especially a new signing			2
that ’s why it ’s hard to criticise @entity45 fans for going a little bit over the top with their cheering and applause for @entity50 – as he warmed up			0
@entity0 has already won the hearts of @entity3 fans following his summer move from @entity53 @entity0 shakes hands with his captain @entity55 ahead of his first appearance at @entity30 but in recent years @entity3 fans have enjoyed the quality and energy of @entity59 , the passion and commitment of @entity62 and @entity55 , the desire to improve shown by @entity64 and @entity65			1
it ’s early days for @entity0 , and he may turn out to be brilliant			2
but then , and only then , will he deserve the kind of response he received on saturday evening			0
if his match sharpness really is n’t there yet , as @entity72 seems to suggest , then i ca n’t understand why @entity22 did n’t start ahead of @entity0			1
i ’m not convinced that is a good enough excuse for @entity0 ’s inertia on saturday			2
he had n’t been away on international duty so he should have done better			0
@entity72 probably should have started with @entity22 ahead of the not - fully - fit @entity0 do n’t settle for less than what you deserve @entity3 fans – just because his name is @entity0 does n’t mean he should get away with giving less than what you supporters deserve			1
more effort and more quality is required from the @entity86 international			0
or i suspect that faith from the fans will be tested to the full .			0

@entity0 was *ineffective* during his first @entity30 appearance as @entity3 lost 1 - 0 to @entity6
the @entity86 *striker* was replaced by @entity22 after 71 minutes
and the standing ovation he received was unwarranted
@entity72 later *admitted* @entity0 was short of match fitness
