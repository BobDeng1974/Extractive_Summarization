by @entity1 reporter published : 06:08 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 12:42 est , 1 april 2013 after months of wrangling the stadium that hosted the most magical moments of the @entity4 has finally got a new tenant			0
@entity6 have been handed the keys to the @entity8 today after a deal for the tenancy was agreed			2
the club were named as the preferred bidders in december but negotiations with the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) have been long and tortuous			1
the reported £ 150million facelift is due to be completed in time for the 2016 - 17 season			1
the @entity8 will be transformed into a 54,000 - seater venue , with the @entity6 now set to embark on a detailed , independent supporter consultation process			1
the club 's chairmen @entity33 and @entity36 said in a joint statement : ' it 's fantastic for everyone at @entity6 that at last all the club 's hard work over the past three years has paid off			2
' ' since we came to @entity6 in 2010 we have had a vision to really take the club forward so @entity6 can compete on the pitch at the highest level			0
ready and waiting : the @entity8 in @entity47 has been out of use since the @entity49 @entity50 , here we come : @entity6 finally look set to leave their long - term home at @entity52 redevelopment : the reported £ 150million facelift is due to be completed in time for the 2016 - 17 season			1
' today 's decision offers us a real platform to do this and we are fully committed to making it a real success			0
' we understand the responsibilities that come with calling the nation 's iconic @entity8 , which will be converted into a world - class football stadium , our new home			1
stunning : the stadium was the focal point of the 2012 @entity49 ' it is an honour we will take on with pride			1
' the lease will give the club long - term security but they will have no property interest in the stadium			2
the deal will protect public interest should @entity6 ’s owners sell the club for a large profit on the back of the move to the stadium - the @entity14 would get a significant cut of any surplus			1
the @entity14 will have the rights to the income from other events such as music concerts and there will also be a legacy for athletics , with a number of events for that sport maintained			2
the retractable seating should allow the stadium to be changed from a football venue - with seats on the running track - to one suitable for athletics or concerts within eight days and potentially even quicker			2
before the deal was announced , sports minister @entity102 said it made sense for a football club to be the main tenant at the stadium , and also suggested the venue could host the @entity110			1
he said : ' i have always thought there would be a really obvious end to this , which would be a multi-use stadium with football at its heart and that was always going to be the way to get the stadium used in post-olympic mode			0
' in terms of the @entity124 , there is an immovable deadline and all the evidence is we ’ll get it done on time			0
as a country we are much better at doing these things than we were 10 years ago			0
last obstacle : @entity133 chairman @entity132 is still seeking a judicial review on the bidding process ' financially it ’s quite tight , so the organisers need big stadiums for attractive games			0
' @entity133 chairman @entity132 insists he is still seeking a judicial review into the bidding process but @entity102 claims this is not a cause for concern			0
he added : ' that is one for @entity147 [ @entity146 ] but i am told that all the legal advice is that the review is likely to fail			0

@entity152 agreed deal with @entity14
£ 150million facelift will see club move in for start of 2016/17 season
@entity49 venue will be transformed into a 54,000 - seater stadium
club chairmen said there are ' responsibilities ' attached to calling the ' iconic ' stadium its new home
