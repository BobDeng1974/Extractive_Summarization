by @entity0 @entity1 are keen on @entity2 but face a difficult battle to fend off competition from @entity5			1
the south coast club can offer more cash up front than the @entity9 in particular but @entity2 would be keen to play @entity11 football if he left @entity12			1
the @entity13 has been continually linked with a move away from @entity15 and is currently on @entity12 's pre-season tour of the @entity17			0
speaking after his side 's 3 - 1 pre-season friendly win over @entity27 , he told the @entity28 : ' we are close to signing two or three new players and we hope to bring them in in the next week , ” said @entity23			1
' we show our ambition			0
of course we lost some good players but that ’s part of the life and part of the good season @entity1 had last season			1
still we are with the same ambition as before			0
' @entity40 revealed that @entity1 had asked for @entity2 during talks over a deal for @entity43 in june			2
in an interview with @entity45 on tuesday , he said : ' i know there is much interest in me from the @entity9 club and i thank them for this			0
uncertain future : @entity53 has been linked with a move to @entity55 saints marching on : @entity1 's players celebrate @entity59 's goal in the win over @entity27 ' there are also other teams and everything obviously is pleasing , but right now i belong to @entity12 and it would be disrespectful to mention other teams even though i do not know what will happen once the tour of the @entity17 concludes			1
' do i liked the @entity5 ? they are a great club , but if i were to transfer , i would not say no to any club			2
@entity9 football , however , is amongst the best in the world , i have followed it since i was little and it would be a very important showcase at a personal level			0
' i am a professional player , i am committed and working in this direction , ready for any eventuality , but at this moment i can not say any more			0
' optimistic : @entity23 is confident of signing three new players within a week @entity23 has seen @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity43 leave this summer but is hopeful @entity53 - who was left out of the win over @entity27 - will not follow suit			1
he added : ' he was not in a good shape to play because he has been training only for five or six days and normally he will play next week against @entity86 at home			2
' about his situation , we wait			0
he is a player of @entity1 and i hope he will continue as a player of @entity1			2

@entity23 confident of signing three new players in the next week
@entity23 hopeful of keeping @entity97 at the club
