whoever beats @entity1 wins the @entity2 this summer			1
it ’s that simple for me , for reasons i ’ll explain in a moment , and @entity6 and @entity7 — with one massive caveat — are the two biggest challengers to the hosts			1
the caveat is whether @entity12 , the world ’s best footballer , is fully fit and playing at his peak			1
if he is , and it ’s a big if , then i think the @entity16 are capable of being the cat among the @entity18 you imagine a final that pits @entity12 on one side against the world ’s second - best player , @entity22 , on the other ? it would be a fantasy showdown			1
i for one would absolutely love to see that happen			2
influence : @entity12 could lead @entity7 to @entity2 glory in @entity1 this summer crucial : with @entity12 in their team , @entity7 could go all the way to the final in @entity33 tough : @entity7 have been drawn in group g alongside @entity35 , @entity36 and the @entity37 if you think @entity12 has an enormous ego already , imagine what it would be like if he reached the @entity2 final ! as a big fan of his , as well as his friend , i relish the prospect of that spectacle			1
he ’s a showman and this is the biggest show			2
people see his ego — and do n’t get me wrong , @entity12 ’s ego is gargantuan ! — but that is his fuel			1
he reads all the articles written comparing him with @entity22			1
‘ how can they say @entity22 is better than me ? ’ he ’ll ask			1
‘ i ’ll prove that writer wrong			0
’ that ’s his mindset			0
self - obsessed in the most positive way			2
that ’s why he has become what he is , through effort and determination			0
it did n’t all come naturally			0
he worked hard at technique and hitting the ball			0
he ’s the hardest worker i ’ve had the privilege to play alongside			1
he ’s a great team - mate , a companionable man , always involved in the changing room			2
but when it ’s time to work he ’s passionate about what he does and his emotion comes out			0
support : hosts @entity1 are among the favourites to be crowned world champions this summer heavyweights : @entity22 's @entity6 team have been tipped to win the @entity2 predictions : @entity85 is tipping @entity1 to be victorious in the @entity2 on home soil people say he stole @entity89 ’s thunder in the @entity91 final			1
eh ? he took his shirt off			0
he ’s got an unbelievable physique and his girlfriend is a supermodel , and someone ’s criticising him for taking his shirt off ? the exhibitionist is part of who he is			0
but away from the field of play he ’s one of the nicest kids you could meet			0
he makes time for fans , he ’ll sit around a table late into the night talking			0
he ’s no lone wolf			0
he first came to our attention at @entity110 when we played @entity111 in 2003			2
by half - time he ’d razzle - dazzled us and we were all in the dressing room asking : ‘ who the hell is this kid ? we must sign him ! ’ and sir @entity117 did			2
he arrived at @entity118 with his tricks and his stepovers and his attitude			0
what a young showpony he was , wanting to look good , then be good , in that order			0
@entity117 had a word or three over time , and so did @entity12 ’s hugely influential compatriot , @entity125 , and we as team - mates let him know there needed to be an end product to his skills			1
@entity131 : @entity85 and @entity12 together in their @entity110 days upstaged ? @entity12 took his shirt off after scoring a penalty in the @entity91 final change : @entity12 left @entity111 in 2003 to join @entity110 , where he became a star to his enormous credit , the penny dropped , and he took it all on board and started on his journey to become the world ’s best			1
there are players who maybe have more natural talent and the penny never drops for them			0
you will have guessed by now that i ’m a fan of @entity12 ’s work ! i hope for him that he has a standout @entity2			1
with him on fire , @entity7 can make huge waves			1
without him , they ’re half a team or less			0
with my pragmatist ’s hat on , and fearing that seven games could be a few too far for @entity7 if @entity12 is n’t 100 per cent physically well , i believe we ’ll see a @entity1 - @entity6 final			1
and i think that @entity1 , inspired by the maverick genius of @entity160 , will be triumphant on home @entity162 see @entity1 overcoming @entity35 ( if not @entity7 ) in one semi-final , and @entity6 beating @entity164 in the other			1
i think @entity166 might struggle to get out of @entity167 , that @entity164 should win , because @entity168 are a fine team , although @entity170 is a match - winner			1
@entity172 and @entity173 should come through @entity174 and @entity176 ’s group are dealt with elsewhere : @entity178 plus one , basically			0
@entity181 win @entity179 for me , and @entity6 take @entity182 , with @entity35 and @entity7 coming out of @entity183 and probably @entity184 winning @entity185 pressure : @entity160 is the poster boy of the @entity2 and is expected to fire @entity1 to glory tricky : 2010 finalists @entity164 and @entity166 have been drawn in the same group this time shining light : with @entity22 leading the line , @entity6 have an number of attacking options the @entity184 should win their group , but they are a peculiar prospect in some ways			1
they could be the team everyone believes they are capable of being and reach the last eight or further			0
or they could be the biggest burster of expectations because their youth and inexperience may tell at this level			0
@entity6 have a strength in depth that means they could cope without @entity22 if they had to			1
it tells you something when a player of @entity214 ’s qualities did n’t even make the cut			0
aside from @entity22 , they have @entity217 , @entity218 — the world ’s best natural goalscorer in my book — as well as @entity223 , one of the stars of the @entity91 last season , and @entity226 , and on and on			1
the one area of caution is defence , but it ’s hardly shabby			0
as big an admirer of @entity164 as i have been in recent times , i do think this could be a tournament too far as age starts to tell			1
but they ’ll still go far			0
but not as far as @entity1			2
the @entity238 victory last summer was a fillip that can not be understated			0
they know now they can perform and win under that enormous home pressure			2
sunning up : @entity243 forward @entity214 missed out on @entity6 's @entity2 squad dark horse : @entity247 playmaker @entity246 will lead @entity184 's quest at the @entity2 in @entity160 they have a player who bucks a common trend of great performances for club and indifferent games for country			1
he pulls on his @entity1 shirt and shines			2
he is @entity1 ’s go - to guy for inspiration , and backing him up he has a cast awash with talent and no small amount of toughness , exemplified by @entity262 , who is a top player			1
@entity263 is a great athlete , so too willian			0
@entity264 will score and @entity265 is a danger			0
@entity1 ’s achilles heel for me is a lack of a traditional no 9 but they have enough elsewhere to compensate			2
as they say in @entity33 : vamos ! @entity85 is an interviewer , programme - maker and football expert for @entity276			2

@entity12 could be the only one to stop a @entity1 - @entity6 final
@entity16 star is hardest worker i *'ve* played alongside
seven matches could be too many for @entity7 if @entity12 is not fully fit
@entity1 , inspired by the genius of @entity160 , will be triumphant on home soil
@entity6 have enough depth that they could cope without @entity22
this @entity2 could be a tournament too far for @entity164 as age starts to tell
