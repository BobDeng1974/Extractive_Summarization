by @entity0 @entity1 discovered that his great - grandfather 's son was arrested for attacking his own father and he suffered horrific treatment in prison what was life like for prisoners when hard labour really was tough ? when they did n't have televisions or the chance to sue warders who dare abuse their human rights ? celebrities including @entity17 and @entity18 find out as a fascinating new documentary series called secrets from @entity21 reveals how their jailbird ancestors were treated in harsh @entity24 prisons			1
the show features five celebrities with porridge in their blood			1
their ancestors ' stories are dramatic – from tragic tales of people who could n't return to the straight and narrow to criminals who managed to turn their lives around			1
take @entity36 judge @entity17 , who 's initially judgmental when he learns his great - great - grandfather 's son @entity37 was sentenced to five years ' hard labour for attacking his own father			1
' he was obviously a hooligan with a vicious temper , ' says @entity1 , who believes he deserved his punishment			1
but then he discovers that @entity37 , who was 22 at the time , was given nine months in solitary confinement at @entity45 , where he was n't allowed to talk to anyone			1
even when prisoners had their daily hour of exercise , those in solitary had to wear a special hat that forced them to look straight ahead			1
the aim was to break a prisoner 's will , or ' grind them good ' as the @entity57 put it , but many ended up going insane and committing suicide			1
' it 's horrific , ' ponders @entity1			1
' i 'm not sure i could have coped with that			2
' @entity37 was then sent for proper hard labour			2
this often involved futile exercises with the sole purpose of making the prisoners sweat ; the phrase ' money for old rope ' refers to the small benefits men could earn for pulling apart tarred - up rope			1
another chore was to crank up a gravel - breaking machine with a handle – the prison officers would often tighten the machine to make it harder to crank , which led to their nickname ' screws '			1
in 1863 @entity37 was sent to the island of @entity84 in the @entity85 to work in the quarries breaking stone for the @entity89 naval yard			2
it was true hard labour , eight hours a day , six days a week			2
life in a @entity93 in 1907 the prisoners were given just enough food to enable them to work ; oats and water for breakfast , stale bread and potato for dinner			2
@entity1 is stunned at just how hard life was			1
' when i see what he had to go through i 'm starting to think the crime does n't fit the punishment , ' he says			1
' i feel so sad for him			2
what he did was terrible but we all have that trait in us ; we can all snap			2
the conditions in those prisons were atrocious			2
you can see why anyone would want to avoid being sent to one			2
' tv presenter @entity18 , 51 , is at first contemptuous of her great - great - grandfather @entity115 , who was convicted for fraud			1
' it 's a bit of a tacky crime , is n't it ? ' is her first response			1
but then she learns he was a salesman who went bust during a recession			2
in those days you could not be personally bankrupted , so he enlisted a friend to keep some possessions such as his children 's clothes out of the hands of his creditors			1
for that he got six months in prison			2
but just before his trial the stress resulted in 30 - year - old @entity115 becoming paralysed			1
eventually he was given early release by the prison authorities , who were unable to look after him			0
@entity18 stands in front of @entity141 @entity140 so he was released , still paralysed and still owing money , with a family to feed			0
' it was so misguided , there was no safety net for real poverty , ' says an astonished @entity18			0
another celebrity whose ancestor had money troubles was soap actress @entity152 , 52 , whose great - great - great - grandfather was locked up in a debtors ' prison for six months in 1848 when his @entity156 umbrella - making business went bust			1
depicted poignantly in the works of @entity160 , whose own father was in one of them , these jails were draconian places to send people who owed money			1
@entity152 is in tears when she hears about what it was like being in the debtors ' prison			0
but things did not improve much when he came out			0
all of his assets , including his tools , were taken but he still needed to keep his family above the breadline			0
' it must have been horrific , ' she says			0
' even after you 've done your time you come out and you have no money			0
i ca n't even imagine what it must have been like for him			0
it 's about as bad as it can be			1
' actor and comedian @entity188 , who has spoken of his own dependency on alcohol , discovers his great - great - great - great - grandmother on his mother 's side was sent to prison more than 100 times for being drunk and disorderly			1
@entity197 , who came from a @entity199 slum , was described in local newspaper reports as ' a notorious drunkard who has been repeatedly before the bench '			0
@entity188 , 43 , is visibly moved as the truth of life as a penniless drunk in victorian times sinks in			0
' she was obviously a damaged individual and i feel like i really get her because of my relationship with alcohol , ' says @entity188			0
' i do n't think anybody ever sat her down and asked her what was wrong			0
' contemporary reports show that she 'd often be rearrested for sleeping rough as soon as she 'd been released			0
' she had nothing to lose , ' he says , fighting back tears as he learns her problems started when her husband died			0
' at least in prison she had shelter and got fed. however hard it was , it was better than living rough			0
' former @entity229 political correspondent @entity228 has perhaps had the most dramatic story of all in her great - great - great - great - great - grandmother , @entity231			1
a domestic servant , she was caught stealing a horse in a bid to escape the house and at first faced the gallows , but ended up being transported to @entity237			0
her relatives had put together a petition to @entity240 @entity24 begging that she should not be ' doomed to a miserable exile ' , but @entity237 ended up being the making of her			0
after serving her sentence she was given some land in @entity245 and married a freeman , junior officer @entity246			0
the two set up a wealth of successful businesses as well as having seven children			0
@entity231 's picture is now on the @entity237 $ 20 dollar note thanks to her charity work			1
@entity228 , 42 , is astonished			0
' to have that as my family legacy and to have some of her dna is an incredible honour			0
it shows there are no boundaries in your life ; there is nothing you can not overcome			0
' secrets from @entity21 , 6 august , 9pm , @entity229 .			0
