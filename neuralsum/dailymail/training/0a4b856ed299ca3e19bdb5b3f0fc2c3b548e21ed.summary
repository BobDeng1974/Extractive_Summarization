@entity5 was just 18 - months - old when she underwent major surgery to remove the enormous cyst , which stretched from her cheekbone down to her chest			1
the operation involved making an incision right around her neck before pulling the skin back			0
@entity5 ( pictured with her mother , @entity34 ) had most of the cyst removed when she was a baby but some still remains and can cause problems her father , @entity114 , 42 , said : ‘ it was a very tough time for us			1
‘ one of the main risks of the operation was paralysis but there was never really an option			0
@entity5 ( pictured with her parents @entity34 and @entity114 , and her sister , @entity124 ) could have been paralysed by the surgery to remove the cyst when she was a toddler @entity5 ( pictured with her sister , @entity124 , six ) had to have further surgery to have her tongue reconstructed because it was still too swollen to fit inside her mouth properly ‘ the cyst affected everything and it was very uncomfortable for her			1
‘ it leaked fluid and blood through the night and her dressings would constantly need to be changed			0
’ after regular treatment at @entity60 in @entity139 , @entity5 was finally allowed back home to @entity141 , @entity142			2
@entity5 now faces a daily battle to fight the condition , in the hope that further cysts wo n't develop however , her tongue was so swollen that she could not keep it in her mouth and so she required a further operation to reconstruct it			1

@entity5 was born with a cystic hygroma - a huge cyst on her face
extended from her cheekbone to her chest and caused her tongue to swell
she had most of the cyst removed when she was 18 - months - old
the remaining part can swell and become infected if aggravated
if this happens , it can put pressure on her internal organs
