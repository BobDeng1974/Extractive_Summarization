the sight of @entity1 in a wet white shirt left millions of women swooning and transformed the actor into a household name			1
playing the brooding mr @entity7 in @entity8 , he dived into a lake and swam underwater before emerging with his clothes dripping and clinging to his body			1
but the screenwriter of the @entity15 ’s 1995 adaptation of @entity17 ’s novel has now revealed that the ‘ wet shirt scene ’ should have actually been the ‘ mr @entity7 full - frontal nudity scene ’			1
@entity20 said the ' wet shirt ' scene with @entity1 in @entity8 was intended as the ' mr @entity7 full - frontal nudity scene ' but the shirt was added later the writer said he wanted to reveal mr @entity7 's ' animal ' side by showing him diving into the lake @entity20 said he did not know why the shirt was introduced but that it might be because @entity1 was trying to hide his ‘ love handles ’			1
‘ i intended it as a funny little scene about social embarrassment , ’ mr @entity20 said			1
‘ here are two people and one is soaking wet and neither of them refers to it			0
‘ in fact it seems to have affected women in quite a different way - and who am i to complain ? ’ he said he wanted to show @entity7 ’s ‘ animal ’ side by having him dive naked into a lake			1
‘ the wet shirt scene was intended to be total male frontal nudity because that was how guys went bathing in those days			1
but it was not for titillation - it was about nature and culture , to put it in a very grand way , ’ he added			2
‘ it was my notion that @entity7 was an actual man but he spent all his time being constrained by the demands of society			1
@entity1 has filmed nude scenes since , such as this one in @entity61 mr @entity20 said the famous scene was about ' social embarrassment ' ‘ in those particular circumstances he had just spent weeks and months in @entity65 being polite with a group of very stuffy people , he was about to host a house party for the same stuffy group of people and he had a few hours in which he could be blissfully alone			1
‘ he could be blissfully himself			0
it was a hot day			0
he arrives at his lake			0
there is nobody to stop him			0
i thought he would strip off completely and dive into that other element and become just a creature , an animal for once			0
‘ i do n’t know the reason why it ( the shirt ) came to be			2
maybe it was felt it would take too long to get him dressed , although they could have just shown him diving in naked and then cut to later			0
‘ it may have been something about @entity1 ’s anxiety about love handles or something			1
’ he told the audience at @entity95 that he had deliberately written physical elements into the screenplay of the @entity17 classic			0
‘ i had a kind of project to try to emphasise that these people have bodies as well as brains and little bits of wit and irony and so on , ’ he said			2
‘ i devised as many scenes as possible in which people were getting dressed , getting undressed , having a bath , girls combing their hair - what we call hair and shoulder scenes			2
’ it has previously been revealed that @entity1 never actually dived during filming			2
a stuntman performed the dive amid health and safety fears that the actor might catch a water - borne disease from the lake			0
and footage of him swimming underwater was actually filmed in a tank at @entity129 in @entity65 , hundreds of miles from @entity131 in @entity132 which was the location for @entity134 in the 1995 @entity15 adaptation .			0
