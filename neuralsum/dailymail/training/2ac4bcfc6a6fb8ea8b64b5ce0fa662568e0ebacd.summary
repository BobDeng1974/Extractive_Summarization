by @entity0 last updated at 12:11 am on 8th december 2011 [ headerlinks ] private care : @entity2 have struck a deal for maternity care with @entity6 an @entity2 trust has become the first in the country to sign a contract with a private company to provide maternity care			1
@entity2 has made a deal with @entity6 following a pilot scheme to provide services to women in the local area			1
those women opting to go with @entity6 will be provided with a midwife who sees them through all their antenatal care , birth of the baby and postnatal care			1
this will be an alternative to the usual @entity2 services on offer , although @entity6 midwives will be able to go into @entity2 hospitals to deliver the baby if the woman has a hospital birth			1
the company is now in talks with other @entity2 trusts around @entity35 and @entity36 about providing some of their maternity services			0
at present , the firm employs 28 people , including 20 midwives , but is looking to expand			0
in the two weeks since the contract was signed with @entity2 , around 10 babies have been born using @entity6 midwives , most of them at home			1
it is the first time the @entity2 has signed a contract of this nature			0
the decision has the backing of the @entity51			0
the @entity6 website said : ' set to be the gold standard of midwifery care , the @entity6 personalised maternity service is delivered by a team of passionate , highly motivated midwives who have experience across all aspects of pregnancy , birth and postnatal care			1
' by having just one midwife throughout your pregnancy we ensure continuity of care			0
' women have access to their named midwife from 8am to 8pm every day , and round - the - clock access to another midwife if they need it			0
in the pilot scheme with @entity2 , @entity6 cared for women every step of the way apart from the actual delivery			2
but it has now secured the insurance it needs to provide deliveries as well			0
a statement from @entity2 said : ' @entity2 is pleased to be able to offer women in @entity86 a choice in how and where they would like their maternity care to be delivered			1
' one to one @entity90 provides an opportunity for midwives to offer a different style of care from hospital based maternity units , free at the point of delivery			0
claim : @entity6 's website says the firm offers ' a different style of care to hospital based maternity units ' ' @entity2 continues to contract with local hospital - based maternity services providers ( @entity105 , @entity107 , @entity108 )			1
' therefore , women are free to choose the type of service and location of birth which they feel best meets their needs			2
' @entity115 , the @entity117 ' director for @entity35 , said : ' the @entity117 is aware of the progress made by @entity6 as a maternity service provider , and we welcome it as an add - on service for choice for women			1
' however , we have reservations regarding the impact upon jobs for midwives in the @entity2			1
' we have formed a professional relationship with @entity6 to gain recognition for our members , as they will be an alternative employer for midwives			0
' the contract will initially run for three years and follows the pilot scheme involving more than 200 mothers			0
@entity6 will provide all the scans and tests that an expectant mother needs in pregnancy , such as blood tests and the 12 - and 20 - week development scans			0
@entity141 , founder and clinical director of @entity143 , said : ' we are thrilled that @entity2 has chosen to award one to one the contract to deliver our maternity care service to mothers - to - be in @entity86			1
' the pilot and now the full contract are quite simply the first of their kind in @entity35 and @entity36			0
not convinced : @entity115 , the @entity117 director in @entity35 , said the deal could ' have an impact on jobs for midwives in the @entity2 ' ' we believe they are the biggest thing to happen in midwifery since @entity160 more than 100 years ago			1
' @entity6 aims to reinvent free midwifery services by delivering a personalised service that places women and their families at the heart of their care			2
' continuity of care has been shown to increase the normal birth rate , reduce hospital admissions and associated interventions , improve breastfeeding rates and boost women 's satisfaction with the whole maternity service			2
' she said the service would ' relieve the pressure on the existing @entity2 system and introduce a specialised service for teenagers and the most vulnerable '			2
and the firm said that ' among the most exciting aspects of @entity6 's care is the encouragement women are given to consider a home birth if this is something they would prefer to a hospital birth subject to their circumstances and needs ' .			2

ten babies have already been born through private firm @entity143
service will provide women with all antenatal care , birth and postnatal care issues
@entity117 fear deal could impact on jobs for @entity2 midwives
