the @entity1 report into @entity3 vote corruption - now in possession of the @entity6 ethics chiefs - is understood to be far more damning of the bidding countries than expected			1
it ’s understood @entity1 details the huge amount of money involved in allegedly attempting to buy votes in those flawed 2018 and 2022 ballots - with the figures even bigger than those revealed in previous newspaper investigations			1
and the persistent rumours about the 2022 decision in particular are enough for bookmakers @entity19 to fancifully make @entity21 odds - on to be stripped of the @entity22			2
this will add yet more pressure on @entity6 to make @entity1 ’s report public with @entity27 judge @entity26 , head of the adjudicatory chamber of the ethics committee , only prepared to make an interim statement next month with no commitment from @entity32 over whether the full 430 - page document will ever see the light of day because of witness confidentiality issues			1
and @entity36 , founder of anti-corruption watchdog @entity36 , said at the @entity50 conference on monday that @entity6 will continue to be ridiculed as long as it keeps @entity1 ’s findings under wraps			2
ironically , @entity50 is a lavish @entity21 - funded event at @entity55 ’s @entity54 where tuesday ’s speakers include @entity27 football great @entity57 , who was banned from football for 90 days for refusing to co-operate with @entity1 — which he eventually did			1
meanwhile , @entity6 president @entity40 ’s vanity project - the @entity6 history film @entity64 - has taken only around £ 150,000 at the box office			2
@entity40 ensured that @entity6 spent £ 16million on it			0
you need to say something special to create any impression during the current sports conference season when so much tosh is spoken			0
and @entity72 , director general of the @entity73 did so at @entity50 by claiming 25 per of world sport had been infiltrated by organised crime – albeit mainly below elite level			0
however , @entity72 would n’t say which sports or where			0
@entity79 have what is described as a dedicated @entity82 account for @entity84 fans - @ @entity85 - that gives information on travel , tickets and security ahead of games			1
so it ’s somewhat surprising that the account is following the personal sites of @entity95 such as @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , who ca n’t all be @entity84 fans			1
the @entity79 's dedicated @entity82 account for @entity84 fans - @ @entity85 - follows @entity95 @entity96 ( left ) and @entity97 ( right ) world heavyweight champion @entity101 was forced to postpone his @entity103 world title with @entity104 this month after he tore bicep muscles in training			1
and the word is @entity109 ’s great heavyweight hope , @entity111 gold medallist @entity110 , surprised @entity101 with his speed and strength while sparring in @entity114 before the fight was delayed			1
@entity116 sparred with @entity110 ahead of his now postponed his fight with @entity104 city take @entity84 rejects @entity119 may be struggling to keep up with rivals @entity118 in the @entity120 , but commercially @entity84 are in a different league			1
@entity55 sales staff laid off by @entity84 for performance reasons have been given jobs in the @entity118 office in the capital			2
meanwhile , it was noticeable that when welcoming park ji - sung into the group of @entity84 club ambassadors on the pitch before the game against @entity134 , sir @entity128 mentioned the ‘ greats ’ who do that role around the world such as @entity139 and @entity140 , but did n’t include himself			1
yet @entity128 is @entity84 ’s best paid ambassador , earning £ 2m for 20 days work a year			2
@entity129 shakes hands with sir @entity128 as he is introduced as a new club ambassador the @entity143 is one of the great sporting events			0
but it can not satisfy the @entity147 or @entity148 that the peak viewing from @entity151 for @entity152 ’ live coverage was 1.7m , compared to 3.1m for @entity154 highlights			0
@entity156 ’s book is n’t officially published until thursday , but has already been overtaken by events			0
@entity156 writes he still has a lot of cricket to play in the @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and for @entity163			0
however @entity163 , for one , have cancelled @entity156 ’s registration			0
@entity156 's registration at @entity163 has been cancelled despite him saying he has a lot of cricket to play			0

@entity1 's report into @entity3 vote corruption is *believed* to be more damning than expected
@entity173 police set up dedicated @entity82 account for @entity84 fans - but only follow @entity95
@entity101 surprised by @entity110 's speed and strength during sparring
