by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:37 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 05:42 est , 6 september 2013 pressure : @entity4 's stance on @entity5 has been questioned by senior party figures @entity4 is coming under growing pressure from @entity9 heavyweights for his refusal to back the government on military action in @entity5			1
ex-prime minister @entity13 said the @entity9 leader had got it wrong in the crunch commons vote as former cabinet minister @entity17 said the party ’s foreign policy had been reduced to ‘ being nice to @entity20 ’			1
mr @entity4 faces growing division in his party over his decision to vote down the government , even after @entity24 moved to accept his concerns about not rushing to war			0
the @entity9 leader initially said he backed a ‘ limited ’ strike against @entity5 , but urged mr @entity24 to tone down a government motion on military strikes for last week ’s vote			1
but the prime minister ’s call for action was rejected by a majority of 13 mps after 39 coalition mps joined with @entity9 to inflict a humiliating defeat			1
today mr @entity13 issued his first major rebuke of the @entity9 leader , saying he disagreed with the way mr @entity4 had handled the who affair			1
the former prime minister said : ‘ i wrote before the vote that i thought we had to support action in @entity5 and i said after the vote that i was disappointed by it			2
‘ so this is something where i just have to disagree with the leadership of the party			2
‘ but i know it ’s a difficult position for political leaders to be put in when they ’ve got to take decisions like this , but my position on these issues is pretty clear over a long period of time			0
’ he was backed by mr @entity17 , a foreign office minister in the @entity13 government who was promoted to @entity57 by @entity58			1
the @entity60 mp warned a ‘ considerable number of @entity62 ( many more than have so said so publicly ) feel deeply uneasy about ’ the fact that mr @entity4 has ruled out a second vote on military action			1
writing in the @entity66 , mr @entity17 expressed alarm that mr @entity4 was following the prime minister 's lead rather than taking a ‘ sensible and measured approach ’			2
on wednesday mr @entity4 insisted the @entity72 vote was not about @entity73 ' shirking its responsibilities ' but about preventing a ' rush ' to war			0
he repeatedly argued that the key was now bringing other countries to the table - including @entity20 - to help negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict			0
but in a a direct swipe at mr @entity4 's approach , mr @entity17 said : ‘ does being nice to @entity20 and talking about @entity73 's now diminished diplomatic and humanitarian role constitute a foreign policy ? ‘ @entity9 needs to have clear and unambiguous answers to these questions			2
they will dominate politics through the party conference season			0
’ division : @entity13 said mr @entity4 had got it wrong on @entity5 while former cabinet minister @entity17 said many @entity62 were ' uneasy ' about the leader 's position mr @entity17 said the amendment @entity9 tabled to the @entity96 motion setting out five conditions for military action last week was ‘ clear and sound ’			1
‘ instead of sticking to this sensible and measured approach , we seem to have abandoned it because of the incompetence of a @entity104 prime minister ’ he said			0
‘ we have allowed @entity9 foreign policy to be dictated by the government			0
’ it comes after @entity108 put himself at odds with brother @entity4 to warn that international intervention in @entity5 is ‘ increasingly necessary ’			0
the former foreign secretary condemned the failure of western governments including @entity73 to ‘ break the diplomatic and military deadlock ’ and warned humanitarian aid can not reach refugees because aid agencies are coming under ‘ aerial bombardment ’			0
his warning that @entity5 risks becoming a ‘ dangerous no - man ’s - land ’ like @entity121 appears at odds with @entity4 ’s insistence that @entity9 will not back a second vote on @entity73 military intervention .			2
