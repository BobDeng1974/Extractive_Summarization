it 's often said that you ca n't see @entity2 in a day			1
well , now you can			0
using 48,000 individual frames , photographers have created the world 's largest panoramic image , allowing you to explore @entity8 's capital like never before			1
taken from the top of the @entity11 , @entity2 's tenth largest building , the interactive picture offers a 360 - degree view that lets you weave through the architectural maelstrom and even occasionally stumble upon some greenery			1
@entity2 in 320 - @entity17 - use your mouse to navigate around @entity2 ( may not work on all mobile devices ) @entity20 : an overview of the 360 - degree image that consists of 320 billion pixels 3 – the number of days it took to shoot all the individual photos 3 – the number of months over which the computer processed the final result 60,000 – times bigger than an @entity32 photo 98 – length in metres if printed in normal photographic resolution 24 – height in metres if printed in normal photographic resolution 29th – the floor at the @entity11 where the photos were taken 20 – number of miles distant to the viewable horizon whether zooming in on the @entity41 , or picking up a group of friends playing football in the park , the picture offers an immediate taste of life in the city			1
photographers spent three days painstakingly capturing the city while enduring sub-zero temperatures , making sure that every inch was covered			1
the 320 gigapixel image ( 320 billion pixels ) took a further three months to finalise , as technicians from photography firm @entity56 amalgamated the images and welded them into a final vista			2
the completed interactive image - 64,000 times more detailed than a standard @entity32 snap - would measure 98 metres in width and 24 metres in height if printed in @entity64			2
the nearest attempt at creating a similar image was in 2010 , taken from @entity67			0
but the image was a quarter of the size , measuring 80 gigapixels			0
these new images , which were taken following the @entity72 , capture the city during a remarkable year in which it hosted the world 's biggest sporting occasion , saw patriotic fervor swell due to the @entity80 's jubilee and welcomed @entity82 's largest building to its skyline			2
vista : a trio of photographers from company @entity56 spent three days in 2012 compiling the images using four cameras detail : the photographers meticulously gathered the images from every angle possible in order to create the image hard work : the trio were forced to endure sub-zero temperatures and 50mph gusts of wind to complete the project toil : after the pictures were taken the team spent another three months amalgamating them into a final piece the image was taken from the @entity11 's 29th floor - with the horizon 20 miles in the distance			1
@entity110 from @entity111 , who sponsored the picture , said : ' what better way to capture that remarkable year than with a full panoramic photograph taken from its roof			2
this is n’t just a world record for the @entity11 , it ’s for @entity2 and the people who live , work in or visit the capital			1
' the interactive map invites @entity123 , or indeed anybody with a soft spot for the capital , to mark their favourite views or places on it			0
the director of @entity56 described how his photography team of @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 had to battle the elements to capture the image			0
@entity136 : the interactive picture allows you to zoom in incredible detail , whether it is looking at the @entity41 or perhaps recognising yourself walking along the street sightseeing : the in - depth zoom function allows to explore @entity2 's landmarks , such as @entity143 hi there : passengers on the @entity146 , another of @entity2 's impressive viewpoints the trio had to endure below freezing conditions and were battered by gusts of winds of up to 50mph			1
@entity153 said : ' so many unknowns and variables had to be addressed in the planning of this unprecedented shoot , really the first of its kind			0
' software and hardware were pushed to the limits , and rain , wind and other potential stumbling blocks had to be dealt with			0
' our photography team of @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 did an amazing job and not a single individual frame from the more than 48,000 planned was missed			2
' stunning : the incredible interactive image of @entity2 comprises more than 48,000 individual frames amalgamated have a look : the image allows users to span the capital as captured from the 29th floor of the @entity11 , @entity2 's tenth largest building the team used four @entity180 cameras to record the 48,640 images			1
they were mounted on @entity185 company @entity184 st robotic panorama heads and positioned in four secure locations around the platform			0
the robotic heads are capable of 72,000 steps in a single 360 degree arc and the cameras here were set to fire four frames a second			0
laptops monitored a live preview of the images			0
the team behind the photo have also hidden a @entity111 mascot in the image , with prizes up for grabs for those who find him			0
operation : the detailed operation captured at height as the photographers captured the images and reviewed them them live as they were fed into nearby computers @entity213 : a compilation of activity was caught in this still , reflecting @entity2 's vivacity			1

image was taken from the 29th floor of the @entity11 , @entity2 's tenth *highest* building , over three days in 2012
if printed out , the photograph would be almost as large as @entity223
the photographers took more than 48,000 individual frames , making it the most detailed picture ever taken
the panorama , captured on four cameras , took three months to process
