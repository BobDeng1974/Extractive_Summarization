@entity0 will underwrite the redevelopment of @entity2 with an interest free £ 114million loan			1
@entity5 have confirmed that work will finally begin on monday to increase the capacity of their stadium to 53,500 , with the @entity10 being remodelled and an extra 8,500 seats being added			1
the project , which has been two years in the planning , will be completed for the start of 2016 - 17 season			1
repayments to @entity0 – who took control of @entity5 in october 2010 after the doomed @entity21 - @entity20 reign – will be made from the extra £ 20m a year revenue the extra seating will bring , over a five - and - a - half year period			1
@entity5 will begin work on monday on expanding the @entity10 at @entity2 by adding 8,500 seats from left to right , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 attend an announcement of @entity5 's stadium expansion at @entity2 along with manager @entity43 and managing director @entity44 the @entity10 will have two new tiers added to take the capacity to over 53,000 by the start of the 2016 - 17 season 45,522 - @entity2 's current capacity 58,800 - @entity2 's potential new capacity 8,500 - phase one to extend the @entity10 4,500 - phase two to extend @entity2 end £ 75m - cost of extension by 2016/17 season £ 260m - cost of overall regeneration in @entity2 the estimated cost of the build is £ 75m with £ 39m going on costs			1
@entity38 told @entity5 's official website : ' it 's very exciting news that we have finally got around to extending @entity2			1
for me , it was all about staying at @entity2			2
as much as i like new stadiums , i 'm more traditional and i like the old stadiums like the @entity64 and places like this , where all the history and all the memories happen			0
' there have been so many unbelievable nights and memories here , it would have been a shame to leave it all and for this to have become houses or apartments			0
' now that they are going to extend the stadium , it 's going to become even bigger , better and noisier			2
hopefully there are many more fantastic memories to come			0
' there are no plans to sell naming rights for @entity2 but the new stand could be sponsored , with @entity5 having held initial talks with interested parties about a potential £ 10million agreement , which would work out roughly at £ 1million per season			1
the redevelopment of @entity2 has been an enormous issue for @entity5 since the turn of this century , with @entity21 and @entity90 famously declaring when they bought the club from @entity93 in february 2007 that they would ' have a spade in the ground ' within 60 days			1
they had intended to build on a site on adjacent @entity98 but their plans were doomed to failure , which is why this announcement is regarded by chairman @entity102 and @entity44 , the club ’s managing director , as being a ' momentous day ' in @entity5 ’s history			2
@entity2 is soon to be altered after @entity5 won permission from the city council in september @entity5 's new @entity10 will be made up of three tiers and will include premium seating for @entity111 fans 1			1
75,731 - @entity112 , @entity113 2			2
60,362 - @entity114 , @entity115 3			2
52,405 - @entity116 , @entity117 4			2
48,707 - @entity118 , @entity119 5			2
46,708 - @entity120 , @entity121 6			2
45,522 - @entity2 , @entity5 ‘ it was just over two years ago that we said our preference was to stay at @entity2 and here we are today announcing that the expansion is going ahead , ’ said @entity102			1
‘ we have made more progress in the last two years than in the last decade			0
’ @entity0 had considered building a complete new ground but , having explored a number of possibilities , they have favoured pursuing a project on the lines of how they redeveloped @entity133 , the home of the @entity135 baseball team			0
@entity102 added : ‘ having experience of expanding @entity133 and being through a similar and very successful project of the @entity135 , everyone at @entity0 is extremely proud and excited to be part of the expanding of @entity2			1
’ @entity141 are the construction company that has been entrusted with the task of building the @entity10 and @entity5 also have planning permission to redevelop the @entity2 stand – which would add another 4,500 seats – in the future			1
but , as yet , there is no urgency to pursue that			0
@entity5 's current @entity2 capacity is just over 45,000 seats - the sixth highest in the @entity152 the @entity10 ( left ) at @entity2 will have an extra 8,500 seats added as well as corporate and hospitality facilities the @entity156 end will be unaffected by the expansion , as will the @entity158 , which is opposite the @entity10 ‘ the football club for many years has been looking for a solution and although it has been a long time coming , under this ownership it has actually been a quick process , ’ said @entity44			1
‘ we spent the first 18 months looking at a variety of solutions and decided staying at @entity2 was the best			2
‘ it has taken two years to get where we are today where we have certainty			0
what we always said is we did not want to create any false dawns			0
finding the right economic solution in the best interests of the club			0
’ a significant chunk of the new seats will go to corporate clients but , at a time when @entity5 supporters have been protesting about the cost of admission prices , @entity44 has argued it is a necessity to supplement incomes if @entity5 are to keep pace with their @entity152 rivals			1
‘ if you use the word “ affordability ” – i do n’t think there ’s a football club in the country who could afford to spend money on a new stand without the assistance of corporate hospitality , ’ said @entity44			0
it will probably pay two thirds or more of the payback of this facility and that is a fact of life			0
‘ you ca n’t find economic solutions that work in big new stadiums that do n’t have corporate			0
we will still be some way behind the corporate hospitality numbers they have at old @entity112 and probably around the same sort of level they do at @entity115			0
it feels right for the model we have created			0
’ @entity214 still influences games - @entity43 when asked about his favourite @entity2 memory , @entity38 said : ' i think personally , it would have to be the @entity218 game or even the @entity220 victory with the so - called " ghost goal "			1
' from the outside , i think it would be difficult to pick one other memory because there 's been so many from so many fantastic players and so many great sides			0
it 's difficult to pick one			0
from my own point of view , it would probably be @entity218			0
' @entity38 's famous goal against @entity218 in december 2004 , which took @entity5 through into the @entity233 last 16 @entity38 celebrates his 86th - minute strike at the @entity156 end and @entity5 went on to be crowned @entity237 champions in @entity238 @entity239 scores the only goal of the 2005 @entity233 semi-final against @entity220 in an all - @entity243 tie @entity239 celebrates his dubious goal as he is mobbed by @entity245 , @entity246 and captain @entity38			1

construction work at @entity2 will begin on monday
@entity5 plan to expand the stadium from current 45,000 capacity
phase one will see 8,500 seats and two tiers added to @entity10
work will be complete in time for 2016 - 17 @entity152 season
