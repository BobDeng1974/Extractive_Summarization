by @entity0 @entity1 is back on @entity3 's streets after attempts by the government to have him deported floundered amid failures to decide which country should take him a violent gangster who was due to have been deported is back on the streets of @entity3 because officials can not work out where to send him			1
@entity1 had been kept locked up for more than four years after finishing a jail sentence for a string of street robberies			1
but immigration officials have been unable to determine his nationality , with both @entity17 and @entity18 refusing to accept him			2
they can not even be sure he gave the correct name and age when he sought asylum in @entity3			2
however , a judge ruled it was unfair to keep @entity1 locked up if there was no prospect of him being deported – even though he presents a ‘ serious risk of violence ’ and there is ‘ a very significant risk both of absconding and reoffending ’			1
@entity1 – the ‘ general ’ of an 80 - strong gang behind a spate of stabbings , shootings and killings on the streets of @entity39 , @entity40 , in 2007 – was freed last month			1
he must wear an electronic tag to monitor his movements , has been told he must live in @entity43 and is banned from returning to @entity40			2
last night the farce was condemned by @entity46 mps			0
@entity47 , a member of the @entity49 home affairs committee said : ‘ the public would expect us to be able to protect them from this kind of person in these circumstances			0
he obviously came here some time ago , but that should n’t stop us sending him back			0
we need to be able to deport somebody whenever it ’s necessary to protect the public			0
’ @entity1 , who is thought to be 24 , arrived at @entity60 with his twin brother in 1999 on a flight from @entity17			1
he had no parent or guardian and no passport or identity documents			0
he claimed asylum , telling officials he was a ten - year - old from @entity18 whose parents were killed in its civil war			2
his asylum claim was refused but he was given permission to stay for four years , before being given a permanent right to stay in 2005			0
a high court judge in october said there was a ' significant risk ' of @entity78 , but he ruled he should go free if the @entity79 could not deport him within three months he soon became involved in crime , running @entity39 ’s notorious @entity82 gang and using the street name @entity84			1
@entity1 has been linked to at least 99 incidents of criminal or anti-social behaviour			1
in february 2009 he was jailed for 27 months for a series of robberies and thefts , and ordered to be deported afterwards			1
in court , police said @entity1 was ready ‘ at any time to use knives and weapons ’ and in a @entity93 video he boasted of stabbing a man in the head			1
@entity1 ’s appeals against deportation were dismissed , so there is no legal bar to him being removed			1
one former police officer told an immigration hearing that @entity1 posed a ‘ serious threat to the public ’			1
at the end of his sentence he was held at an immigration centre but in 2011 he was transferred to @entity109 after intelligence suggested he was involved in smuggling in drugs			0
most of his visitors in @entity109 were known criminals , a court document said			0
his brother make was jailed for trying to smuggle heroin and phone @entity120 cards into @entity109 last year			2
in an effort to discover where @entity1 is from , a linguist analysed his speech but was unable to confirm his nationality , saying that he had a strong @entity40 accent			2
he concluded there was evidence of @entity17 @entity128 rather than the accents used in @entity18			0
@entity130 , director of the @entity131 , said : ‘ it says it all that the authorities are willing to release hardened criminals			0
’ the @entity79 said : ‘ we are very disappointed by the court ’s decision			0
we are continuing to fight for his removal from the @entity3			0

@entity1 is self - *proclaimed* ' general ' of @entity82 gang
he was jailed in october 2008 after being *convicted* of two robberies
government efforts to have him deported have floundered amid failures to decide which country should take him
