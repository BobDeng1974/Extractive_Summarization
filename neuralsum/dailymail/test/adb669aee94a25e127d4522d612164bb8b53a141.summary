an explosive new report reveals that the @entity1 began secretly tracking phones long before the events of 9/11 or passage of the @entity5			1
in 1992 , a @entity7 operation which has since been discontinued , monitored every telephone call made from the @entity1 to one of the up to 116 countries on their watch list for drug trafficking , including almost every country in both @entity14			1
@entity15 uncovered the details of the program , whose vastness was not known until now , and whose practices , especially in gathering bulk information , later became a model for the @entity24			2
this is also now the oldest known example of the @entity1 government authorizing this level of tracking on unknowing citizens of the country			2
the goal was to infiltrate drug trafficking rings , especially those that were previously unknown to members of the @entity7 and federal government			2
the program also allowed agents to monitor calls the ruled out the possibility of foreign ties to the 1995 bombing of the @entity57 federal building by @entity1 @entity58			2
the program only recently shuttered , and was used for nearly two decades , with top @entity33 officials in four administrations - @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , and @entity65 - approving the data collections			2
the data collection did not however allow @entity7 investigators access to the actual content of calls , just the numbers dialed and time of the calls were all recorded			1
a 1998 request for @entity75 to release their call records to the program labeled it as ' one of the most important and effective federal drug law enforcement initiatives			0
' the program was eventually halted not because it had run its course , but rather out of fear for public response should the details be revealed			0
that decision came from attorney general @entity87 in september 2013 , just months after @entity88 began systematically releasing classified information he obtained while working at the @entity24 , most notably documents that detailed the agency 's reach , which while viewed by some as crucial and necessary , was seen by many as an orwellian nightmare , specifically as it pertained to the freedoms and allowances the agency had been granted when it came to spying on @entity1			1
the @entity7 confirmed this , and they now send subpoenas on a daily basis to telephone companies to obtain records			1
former officials who worked at the agency prior to and during the program 's inception speak of it as a necessity at the time as they attempted to combat the seemingly untouchable and infallible @entity110 drug cartels			0
in that regard the program was a massive success , allowing agency officials to take down larger members of drug organizations thanks to a system that no longer required them to reach out to the phone companies every day , where the could only request individual phone records			1
and this years before the program had begun , and the agency was working with just the principles they had developed , two supercomputers and a team of analysts			0
officials could not reveal those the program helped the agency to capture , but we do know that @entity110 barons @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 , also known as @entity135 , were all captured by or with the help of the @entity7 in the years prior to the program			0
the success of this new system impressed president @entity62 , who spoke of the idea of ' sophisticated intelligence - gathering and @entity143 technology ' in a 1989 speech , the first time these concepts had been mentioned by a president			1
those successes were short lived however , and just three years later drug crimes were hitting record highs while also turning increasingly violent , especially in @entity150			0
it was around this time that the @entity7 program was approved , with president @entity62 , along with attorney general @entity153 and chief criminal prosecutor , @entity155 , giving the agency these new data collection privileges in the final months of his first term			1
the report did not reveal when exactly this happened , and if he granted this before or after his failed bid for reelection			0
the @entity7 , who just years earlier were reaching out to phone companies in search of individual records , would now receive phone company records on a daily basis thanks to a request from the @entity33			1
what 's more , whereas before the focus was on getting records only of those who were known drug suspects due to time constraints , the agency now received a list of every single phone call from an @entity1 phone line to a country on the drug watch list			1
the countries changed , with some coming on then going off then coming on again , but the data as always the number and time of the call			0
there was push back from some of the telephone companies at the time , but never to the point that any of them challenged the subpoenas in court			0
they may have also seen no point in challenging these subpoenas in a court when those companies that did show hesitation received a letter from the @entity33 ' urging them to comply			0
' the aforementioned letter to @entity75 in 1998 was an example of these notes sent to the phone companies , and given the fact that six years later there was still unease about turning over these records it would seem this was a constant battle throughout the years the program was active			1
that same letter provides another look at why going to court may have seemed pointless , as the @entity33 wrote that the program was ' legally appropriate ' in the note , penned by then deputy assistant attorney general @entity216			2
the scope of what the records could be used for was heavily checked prior to 9/11 , with all the data being used to investigate drug investigations , with the exception of a few incidents that were seen as potential threats to national security , like @entity57			0
with the program now shuttered , there are some concerns about the list of countries on the @entity7 list being revealed , though officials said that in many cases they were aware of the program , which would likely be just as beneficial to them as to the @entity1			1
the information was also passed along to foreign governments who in turn used it in building their own cases and investigations .			0

it has been revealed the government began secretly tracking phone calls under a program created for the @entity7 in 1992
the program forced phone companies to hand over all *communication* on a daily basis between any @entity1 calling any 116 watch list countries
the data collected included phone numbers and time calls were made , though actual content was not included
the program was approved by every administration beginning with president @entity62
it was only shut down in september 2013 , this after attorney general @entity87 became *nervous* in the wake of the @entity88 leaks
the program also served as a *blueprint* for the @entity24
