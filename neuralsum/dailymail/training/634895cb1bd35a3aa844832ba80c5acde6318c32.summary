by @entity0 published : 20:04 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 04:33 est , 11 march 2014 advances : the new system will make it easier to move money around technology to allow direct payments between mobile phones was unveiled by the big banks yesterday			1
the system cuts out the need to remember sort codes and bank account details			1
instead , you type on your phone the mobile number of the person or business you want to pay			0
the ‘ @entity20 ’ transfers , which will be password - protected , need your bank account to be linked to your own mobile number			1
users will simply tap in the number of the recipient on their phone to authorise an electronic transfer from one account to another			2
the industry hopes the system will replace cheques , which are expensive to transport and process			1
at the same time it could provide a substitute for cash to make relatively small payments to tradesmen , window cleaners or gardeners			0
the idea is that millions of people will have their mobile phone number tied to their bank account – as a substitute for the normal account number and sort code			2
there is a security safeguard in that the name of the recipient will appear on the smartphone screen , once the number has been tapped in , so confirming the cash is going to the right person			0
access to the @entity20 system will be covered by password or code protection in an attempt to avoid the risk of the phone being stolen and used to raid customers ’ accounts			1
@entity20 has been devised by the finance industry ’s @entity66 , which is the trade body responsible for running the electronic payments system on behalf of banks and building societies			1
the council ’s chief executive , @entity72 , said : ‘ we ’re all used to the idea of a ‘ mobile update ’ to improve our apps - @entity20 is a mobile update for payments that means you can pay securely using just a mobile number			2
‘ @entity20 will make it easier to repay a friend for cinema tickets , split a restaurant bill or settle up for a colleague ’s birthday collection			2
’ changes : the system ' has the potential to link up every bank account in the country with a mobile number ' he added : ‘ @entity20 is a great example of industry - wide collaboration that delivers tangible benefits for customers			1
‘ the service has the potential to link up every bank account in the country with a mobile number			0
‘ millions of people will be able to use it this year and we look forward to expanding @entity20 even further , so everyone can benefit from this easy , secure new way to pay			2
’ @entity20 will be integrated into customers ’ existing mobile banking or payment apps as an additional way to pay , making it possible to send and receive payments using a mobile number			1
when it is launched in the spring , customers of nine bank and building society brands – @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , and @entity129 - will be able to use the new service			0
the nine launch brands will offer their customers the opportunity to register their mobile number and select the current account they want payments made into before the service goes live			0
this will immediately make the new system the most wide - ranging payment service capable of moving funds directly from account to account , without the need for sort codes or account numbers			0
@entity20 will expand later this year to include @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151			0
the @entity153 building society is committed to joined in early 2015 , while the @entity154 and @entity155 are also finalising their participation .			0
