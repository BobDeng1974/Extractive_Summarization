many years ago - aged 13 - i came to @entity1 on a mountain - climbing trip and nearly died			1
my teacher lost a small group of us near the top of a foggy peak on @entity8 , and we had to be guided down by a stranger			1
three decades on , i 'm back , now with my wife and family			1
where the seagulls fly : @entity14 offers pretty seascapes , quiet harbours and gentle getaways we 're on the island of @entity14 , overlooking the mainland			1
so , what greets me in the distance when i open the curtains on our first morning ? those same scary mountains			2
this time , though , they fill me with joy			2
it 's a bright , sunny day and the @entity27 , the thin band of water that separates this small island from ' proper ' @entity31 , is sparkling like a @entity33 ' disco glitter ball			1
it 's a blissful scene			2
long shadows , tiny fluffs of clouds , the sound of seagulls			2
we are staying for two nights at the @entity42 , built 165 years ago as a dower house by an eccentric local baronet to mimic a @entity46 chateau			2
its baroque arches and turrets look mighty peculiar plonked on the @entity31 coast			2
@entity52 about in boats : @entity55 , on the north coast of @entity14 , is an especially lovely location the house is laid out as if a grand family still lives there			1
dinner is served in a wood - panelled banqueting hall and there 's the sweet smell of wood smoke wherever you go			0
my wife and i wallow in the peace of the place			1
but is there anything to keep our young children occupied ? absolutely			0
we head to @entity73 , a slightly silly name for a very good aquarium			0
the children , @entity77 and @entity78 , are amused by tales of spiny lobsters that crawl for thousands of miles nose to tail with hundreds of their chums along the seabed from @entity31 to the @entity86			0
i 'm intrigued by the idea that bream can change their sex if they need to			0
outside , there 's an inflatable slide , crazy golf and ice cream			0
we spend the day there before going for a plate of local mussels at @entity98 in @entity27			0
the next day we aim for @entity99 , ten minutes from the hotel			1
built by @entity102 in the 13th century , it is an impressive ruin with a pretty moat			1
but it is not shown off to its best advantage			0
my lot want to know what it was like to live there when it was a military command centre			0
so do i. towers and turrets : @entity42 is one of @entity14 's more idiosyncratic accommodation options where did the warriors eat their rations ( and what did they eat ) ? where did they sleep ? what weapons did they have ? we leave a little disappointed and then , by accident , stumble across two brilliant places : the town 's 400 - year - old courthouse and a sinister @entity130 prison , which are no longer in use and have been opened to the public			1
talk about ' access all areas ' - nothing is behind perspex			0
you are encouraged to walk where you like , touch what you want			0
we read the graffiti the prisoners carved into the floor and lie on prison issue hammocks			1
the good news : if you were condemned to death , the night before the hanging you got to sleep in a cell twice the size that of the other inmates			0
the @entity149 and @entity150 grew to love @entity14 and were sorry to leave			1
now i know the feeling			0
@entity153 ( 0871 977 4222 , www.virgintrains.co.uk ) runs services from @entity155 to @entity156 , @entity14 - from £ 30 return			1
double rooms at @entity42 ( 0330 333 7222 , www.amazingvenues.co.uk ) start at £ 175 , on a bed - and - breakfast basis .			0
