total number of @entity2 theatre - goers last year – 22 million			0
total attendance at @entity4 matches last season – 13.94 million			2
the after - party has been as embarrassing and depressing as the @entity8 performance			1
@entity9 has become the go - to destination for failed @entity12 footballers and it was along that gaudy @entity13 that @entity14 chose to commemorate his putrid contribution on the great stage of @entity17 2014			1
once our great white hope , now our big white dope , @entity14 drowned his and the nation ’s sorrows by drinking and smoking in a casino ’s swimming pool			2
up in smoke : @entity14 and a gaggle of friends enjoy the scene in @entity9 @entity30 , who kept goal against @entity32 like a petrified rabbit , saw fit to join @entity14 in the company of boozy hangers - on and girls hanging out of their bikinis			1
each to his own way of grieving , i suppose			0
most in this country were caught in a confusion of shock and mourning after the quickest and most humiliating @entity8 finals exit in @entity12 ’s history			1
to his credit , the captain has had the decency to retire from the international game			0
one of the few to have worn the white shirt with distinction in recent years , @entity52 honestly admitted he was on his last legs in @entity17			1
not that he was the only @entity12 left flagging in the slipstream of football ’s high - speed development at this tournament			2
inadvertently , however , @entity52 has been equally frank about the limitations of the domestic game which finds itself burdened with rekindling public interest in our national sport after its thorough @entity8 dowsing			1
@entity52 reveals that this was biting advice to @entity32 as he pondered his transfer to @entity70 : ‘ i told him not to go to @entity72			1
with all due respect to them , he is too good for @entity72			2
’ speaking his mind : @entity52 ( left ) told @entity32 he was ' too good ' to join @entity72 swansong : @entity77 heads to @entity78 with those few words he exposed the delusional notion of the @entity4 as the greatest in the world			1
@entity72 are one of the big five clubs in @entity12			1
they qualify for the @entity84 as regularly as that giant clock high behind one goal at the @entity87 ticks off each unforgiving minute without a goal			0
yet in the estimation of one of the iconic figures of our football they are not worthy of signing a truly world - class goal - scorer , even though he is psychologically flawed			2
that will come as interesting reading to @entity99 ’s national hero @entity98 as he travels in the reverse direction , from @entity70 to @entity72 , in contradiction of the trend for most of the stars at this @entity8 to move anywhere other than @entity12			1
@entity12 footballers – with the exception of veterans like @entity77 and @entity107 as they venture in search of a last hurrah – shuffle between our own teams			1
so much of a muchness are they that a club like @entity113 can sell off a whole bunch of its first team players and still express confidence that an incoming job - lot of cheap signings and an upsurge of youngsters will be good enough for another season of @entity4 survival			1
depressingly , they are probably right			0
revolving door policy : @entity126 boss @entity125 has seen many of last year 's first team depart worryingly , by cherry - picking those they perceive to be the most @entity131 , @entity130 may turn into the next @entity132 – even as their resurgence has just carried them closer to the @entity4 title than for many a season			1
@entity132 thought mistakenly that it would be good business to spend the fortune @entity139 paid them for @entity141 on a half a team of average players			2
now @entity130 are doing the same with the @entity32 money			2
perhaps they are right that @entity146 has a few goals left in his aging legs			0
as for @entity151 , his mundane efforts in @entity17 came as little surprise to those of us who saw pictures of him posing with his underpants exposed , as well as a grotesque tattoo			1
given that this vain posturing was in inverse proportion to the way in he floundered out of his depth at the @entity8 it is hard to resist the conclusion that here , as with @entity14 , is yet another young @entity12 footballer who is under the premature misconception that he is already a superstar			1
since he will be injured for some weeks , we will have to wait to see whether @entity151 can justify his £ 25million fee			0
do n't believe the hype : @entity151 cost @entity130 £ 25m yet does he already think he 's a superstar ? @entity175 @entity130 v @entity174 highlights not that he was alone among over-hyped youngsters who found themselves overwhelmed in @entity17			1
defensively sound ? @entity177 @entity178 never recovered from a poor start			0
@entity177 , when his chance came , looked like another in the succession of left backs who are good going forward but dodgy at defending			0
even @entity186 disappeared after a bright beginning against what we came to realise was an @entity191 team almost as pathetic as @entity12			1
the declining quality of the @entity12 footballer is playing into the descent of the @entity4			1
it is having a negative effect on the quality of the imports			0
@entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 in the case of @entity203 , even @entity191 now that @entity204 is enjoying a renaissance , have taken over as the destinations of choice for the world class footballer			1
when the public discern more drama , entertainment and excitement on the @entity2 stage than at football ’s theatres of dreams , the @entity4 find itself caught somewhere between slipping into the wings and turning itself into a circus of cheap commercial thrills			0
and as its false idols admire themselves so narcissistically in the mirror , they may care to reflect on another revealing pair of statistics			0
only one actor in every 50 on the @entity2 stage earns more than £ 20,000 a year			0
average salary of the @entity4 player - £ 31,000 a week			2
@entity230 ’s sanity was questioned when he sold @entity231 to @entity203 and @entity232 to @entity233 , while tempting @entity234 into paying a club record fee for @entity236 by lending him to them even though he seemed to need a goal - scorer at @entity239			2
how the @entity8 has proved the special one right			2
would @entity203 still have lavished £ 50m on @entity231 after seeing his catastrophic performances for @entity17 ? highly doubtful			0
@entity236 , only in the @entity243 team because of injury to others , was dropped after an utterly ineffective first game and remained on the bench thereafter			0
yet @entity234 have still shelled out £ 28m			0
great bit of business : @entity236 joined @entity234 to boost @entity239 's coffers to the tune of £ 28m @entity232 , did well enough at @entity252 to grab a last minute plane ticket to @entity17 but was left out of @entity199 ’s team for the first two matches of their disastrous world title defence			1
even then he was still only recalled as late substitute during their dead rubber third game			0
a meaningless goal in that match was hardly retrospective justification for a giant fee – but @entity233 ’s £ 37m was already in @entity230 ’s transfer chest			0
along with all his marbles			0
the @entity270 family are attempting to sell another multi-million pound chunk of their holding in @entity233 , after their appointment of @entity276 revived the previously ailing share price			0
which begs one awkward question : do the @entity281 owners not fully share the faith of the market in @entity284 being the @entity286 sir @entity285 ?			0

@entity52 exposed the delusional notion of the @entity4 as the greatest in the world
he told former team - mate @entity32 he was ' too good ' to join @entity72
@entity12 footballers shuffle between our own teams
some over-hyped youngsters including @entity14 , @entity151 , @entity178 and @entity180 *flattered* to deceive with @entity12 in @entity17
@entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , even @entity191 , have taken over as the destinations of choice for the world class footballer
@entity230 was proved right after the @entity8 with some brilliant business
