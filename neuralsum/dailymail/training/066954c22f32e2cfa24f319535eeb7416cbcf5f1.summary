by @entity0 last updated at 1:32 am on 8th october 2011 beleaguered savers faced a new nightmare yesterday as 12 banks and building societies had their credit ratings downgraded			1
those with large amounts of savings were urged to move their money to safe havens amid fears that some banks could go under			1
just a day after @entity15 governor @entity14 said the world was facing its worst ever financial crisis , @entity13 slashed the ratings of @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , the @entity22 , the @entity24 building society and seven smaller societies			1
save our savings : a protest outside the @entity15 on thursday pensions downgrades the downgrade saw their share prices tumble			0
it is also likely to drive up borrowing costs and starve businesses of credit			0
that prospect sparked @entity39 calls for @entity21 to be totally nationalised and forced to lend to small firms			1
@entity42 insiders warned that the bank might need another state bailout to pass ‘ stress tests ’ being conducted by the @entity46			1
@entity21 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity47 , @entity24 , @entity48 , @entity49 & @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 to add to the panic , another credit rating agency , @entity57 , downgraded the prospects of @entity60 and @entity61 , describing the economic outlook for both as ‘ negative ’			1
that increased the chance of @entity67 ’s third and fourth biggest economies needing massive loans			0
@entity70 taxpayers have already contributed £ 12.5billion to a £ 235billion fund to prop up @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			0
the @entity57 downgrade will pile greater pressure on @entity70 banks , which are heavily exposed to other financial institutions in the troubled eurozone			1
@entity80 ’s said the downgrades followed the government telling the banks to stand on their own two feet rather than rely in future on taxpayer bailouts			1
the agency said it believes the institutions are now at greater risk of needing financial help			0
@entity21 and @entity90 – which both received handouts – saw their shares drop by more than 3 per cent			1
@entity80 ’s said the downgrade was not a sign the banks ’ situation had deteriorated			2
storm : @entity15 governor sir @entity14 , left , warned of the biggest financial crisis in history , but chancellor @entity100 said the government had a plan for the growing storm @entity104 : ' from the government ’s point of view the most worrying of the @entity70 bank downgrades will be @entity108 and @entity109 , in which they hold 82pc and 40pc stakes respectively			1
customers on the high street looking for the safest place to deposit their money face hard decisions too , as trusted names such as the co-operative , @entity24 and @entity20 are also downgraded			0
the wise depositor should now seek to spread their savings as widely as possible and not necessarily just chase the best return			0
' read more here from yesterday 's mail but the change is likely to drive up the cost of borrowing , hitting small firms already starved of cash			0
last night @entity39 peer @entity128 , a close ally of business secretary @entity129 , said : ‘ we must now nationalise @entity21 to do the job our nation needs			1
‘ taxpayers own 82 per cent of the shares but we ’re getting the worst of all worlds because the @entity137 hides behind outside shareholders instead of controlling lending and bonuses			0
@entity21 is the worst culprit , starving viable small businesses of the credit they need to grow			1
‘ they ca n’t wait for the @entity137 to dream up fancy new financial structures – they just want them to pull the stuck lending levers now right under their noses , starting with @entity21			1
’ @entity100 insisted the government ’s calls for the banks to hold more cash had helped protect them from the worst of the financial whirlwhind			1
the chancellor said @entity70 was ‘ out of the @entity160 ’ , adding : ‘ i am confident that @entity70 banks are well capitalised , they are liquid , they are n’t experiencing the kind of problems that some of the banks in the eurozone are experiencing			2
’ but experts warned those with savings of more than £ 85,000 to divide their money between institutions			0
the sum is the maximum guarantee for each separately - registered bank or building society under a government compensation scheme			2
@entity171 , founder of campaign group save our savers , said : ‘ the downgrade of 12 banks and building societies will further undermine savers ’ faith in the banking system			2
double - dip recession fears in the @entity182 eased today after a better - than - anticipated jobs report for september			1
@entity182 firms created 103,000 jobs , against economist expectations of 60,000 , but the additional hiring was not enough to lift the overall unemployment rate , which stayed at 9.1 per cent for the third month in a row			1
the data gave markets across @entity67 a modest boost with the @entity193 up more than 70 points soon after the figures were released , though the @entity70 's top flight eased back subsequently			1
@entity197 , chief economic strategist at @entity198 , said : ' in the big picture , today 's reading soothes recessionary fears			2
' companies with large @entity182 businesses led the rally			1
building supplies firm @entity205 , which generates 40 per cent of revenues in the country , topped the @entity193 risers while there were also good gains for @entity211 and @entity213 group @entity212			1
the @entity182 labour department also raised its estimates for the number of jobs created in the previous two months			1
non-farm payrolls , or new jobs added , rose by 57,000 in august and by 127,000 in july , according to the revised data			0
‘ most people ’s savings will be more than adequately covered by the government guarantee			0
‘ but anyone with more would be well advised to spread their money over several institutions which are separately registered for the compensation scheme			0
’ @entity228 , of the comparison site @entity230 , said : ‘ savers will be nervous on banks and building societies being downgraded			2
‘ the savings environment is increasingly challenging for savers looking for security and good rates			0
‘ but they should not panic and take money out of banks and put it under the mattress			2
' their money is protected by the government compensation scheme			0
’ established in 1900 , @entity80 ’s vies with @entity247 ’s as the world ’s biggest credit ratings agency			0
' it is a public company listed on the @entity249 and legendary investor @entity250 is the biggest shareholder with a stake of 13 per cent			0
@entity80 ’s failed to raise the alarm in the run - up to the financial crash			2
@entity258 and @entity259 both enjoyed top - notch ratings from the agency before they nosedived in 2008			2
@entity57 , which was set up in @entity262 in 1913 , is the smallest of the big three credit ratings agencies			0
it merged with @entity70 - based rival @entity265 in 1997			2
what are bank credit ratings ? three big agencies – @entity80 ’s , @entity247 ’s and @entity57 – analyse the balance sheets and trading environments of financial institutions on a regular basis so that investors , depositors , and the government can make a judgements as to their stability			2
the top - notch rating is @entity279 are they important ? they determine how easily the bank or building society can obtain loans on the money markets and therefore maintain cash - flow , or liquidity			2
but almost as importantly they affect the general perception of how safe an institution @entity80 ’s is saying these banks and building societies are now less safe ? well , sort - of : it is saying that they are less likely to receive capital injections from the public purse in a crisis			1
smaller building societies are likely to come out of this analysis badly because they are small enough for the government to allow them to fail if they get into financial difficulties			0
but the report also implies that now – unlike during the financial crisis when the government came to the rescue of stricken banking giants like @entity19 and @entity21 – no bank is too big to fail			1
the @entity24 , which has been downgraded , is the biggest mutual in the @entity309 by saying this @entity80 ’s is in itself making them less safe ? yes , there ’s a perverse logic at work			0
governments might be less willing to jump in to help an institution with a poorer credit rating , and depositors and investors may start to avoid @entity320 we trust these agencies ? many people think not			0
they did not come particularly well out of the financial crisis , when they failed to spot the massive weaknesses in big world banks ’ balanced sheets caused by the trading in sub-prime mortgage @entity328 chastened by that experience , some suspect now that they are too trigger happy in their judgements on @entity333 will be the immediate impact ? the direct impact may be minimal			0
banks obtain their funding from a variety of sources including long - term bonds which will now be more expensive			1
moreover , the new round of quantitative easing announced by the @entity15 , which could reach a total of £ 300bn in fresh cash , should ensure that the high street banks can sell securities to the bank for cash			0
so mortgage , loan and card borrowers should hopefully not see rates rise or credit harder to come @entity355 what does it mean for savers ? customers on the high street looking for the safest placed to deposit their money have traditionally faced tricky choices , and many were caught out by the collapse of @entity364 in september 2007.but @entity305 guarantees mean ordinary depositors are protected up to £ 85,000 ( £ 170,000 for joint accounts ) at each separate institution where they hold deposits			1
those worried about private sector banks might consider national savings bonds , savings accounts or @entity373 – which are directly guaranteed by the government – as possible homes for spare cash .			0

decision will make it harder for banks to borrow and loan
doubts over @entity305 support behind move
fears state - controlled @entity21 will require new bailout
@entity100 says @entity305 has ' credible plan ' to *weather* ' growing global debt storm '
@entity193 boost as @entity182 double dip fears eased by employment figures
