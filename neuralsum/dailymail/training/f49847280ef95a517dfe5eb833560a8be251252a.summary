when @entity1 lost her daughter @entity2 to stillbirth in may last year she was n't ready to say goodbye straight away			1
the hospital in @entity6 where she had her baby provided her with a ' cuddle cot ' - piece of medical equipment that acts like a refrigerated bassinet and allows babies to stay in the room with their parents so they do not need to be taken straight to the morgue			1
mrs @entity1 , 39 , and her husband @entity17 found the extra 48 hours they got to spend with @entity2 so precious that they wanted to raise money to buy another one for other mothers to use			1
' they had the cot there , i just never expected i 'd be the first one to use it , ' mrs @entity1 told @entity47			1
her waters broke early and on may 16 of this year her daughter @entity49 was stillborn – 18 weeks and three days into the pregnancy			2
mrs @entity1 , who lives on a farm 112km north of @entity6 , said using a cuddle cot to buy extra time with @entity2 and @entity49 allowed her to say goodbye in a way she felt comfortable			1
' that 's the only time you get to spend with these precious babies , ' she said			2
' they 're the only memories you 're ever going to have with them			0
' mrs @entity1 knows how traumatic it is to have to say goodbye without a cuddle cot , because she has suffered four stillbirths in total			1

pictured right is @entity2 lying in her comfort cot mrs @entity1 donated this comfort cot to a local charity after @entity2 's death and tragically was the first one to use it when she suffered another miscarriage in may this year - losing daughter @entity49 at 18 weeks before her first stillbirth she had given birth to three children – @entity27 , now 14 , @entity29 , 12 and @entity28 , 4			1
but during her fourth pregnancy her waters broke early and baby @entity83 was delivered stillborn on december 11 2009			2
since then she has suffered three more still births – @entity85 in june 2012 , @entity86 in 2013 and @entity49 this year			2
doctors have not been able to work out why			0
' in the scenario where you have n't got a cuddle cot you have to buzz the nurse if you want to see your baby and they 've then got to go get her [ from the morgue ] , ' she said			2
' and then to see them walk in with a canvas bag and unzip a bag and your baby 's lying in there			0
' when i think back to that experience that was just awful seeing my baby in a green canvas bag			0
' mrs @entity1 knows how traumatic it is to have to say goodbye without a cuddle cot , because she has suffered four stillbirths in total her baby @entity83 was delivered stillborn on december 11 2009			1
since then she has suffered three more still births - @entity85 in june 2012 , @entity86 in 2013 and @entity49 this year mrs @entity1 said many people – even mothers who have stillbirths - do n't know about cuddle cots because it 's such a painful subject			1
' it does make people feel uncomfortable , the death of a child , because it 's really not the natural order of things , ' she said			0
' other people have n't met that baby , only the parents , so they have n't made that connection			2
' it 's almost like it 's not a real death			0
' @entity131 ceo @entity130 said cuddle cots were uncommon , because they cost about $ 5000 and were not priority equipment for hospitals			1
' it 's usually that mothers [ who have had a stillbirth ] want to buy one and donate to their local hospital , ' ms @entity130 told @entity47			2
mrs @entity1 said many people - even mothers who have stillbirths - do n't know about cuddle cots because it 's such a painful subject ' but parents who have the opportunity to have them say it 's important to be able to spend that time with the child			1
' in @entity150 six babies are stillborn every day			2
stillbirth affects 2200 families per year and occurs in one in every 135 births			2
' it 's huge , and in around 40 percent of cases they never find out the cause , ' ms @entity130 said			0
mrs @entity1 is currently fundraising to donate a second cuddle cot to charity @entity159 , and is $ 700 away from her target			1
@entity161 , 34 , is also currently trying to raise money to donate a cuddle cot to her local hospital			1
mrs @entity161 , who lives in @entity165 in south @entity166 with her husband @entity167 and three - year - old son @entity168 , lost her daughter @entity169 to stillbirth in august last year			1
@entity161 and her husband @entity167 lost their daughter @entity169 to stillbirth in august last year she did n't have access to a cuddle cot and had never heard of them at the time , and so she got to spend just seven hours with @entity169 before saying goodbye			1
' i wrote a poem which i read to her over and over , ' mrs @entity161 told @entity47			2
' we bathed her , i dressed her			0
we really just cuddled her and just held her			0
mrs @entity161 is currently trying to raise money to donate a cuddle cot to her local hospital in memory of @entity169 ' that seven hours sounds like a long time but it just goes so quickly			1
' afterwards her work colleagues helped her raise $ 8000 to donate to stillbirth charities , and she was researching ways to use the money when she came across cuddle cots			2
mrs @entity161 said if she had had access to one the whole experience would have been very different			0
' it definitely would have changed things because she would have been more real to my family and friends , ' she said			0
' no one got to meet her except me and my husband			0
' sometimes we feel uncomfortable , like people think she did n't exist so we should just get over it			0
' earlier this year she donated one cuddle cot to @entity204 with the money her work had raised , and since then she has been contacted by a number of mothers thanking her for enabling them to use it			1
' one mother got to spend 36 hours with their baby , which is five times the amount of time that we got , ' she said			0
mrs @entity161 is now 39 weeks pregnant and is due to give birth on monday			0
