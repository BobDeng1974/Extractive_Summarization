by @entity0 @entity1 on sunday agreed to buy @entity2 for $ 48.5 billion , or $ 95 per share , a move that gives telecommunications company a larger base of video subscribers and increases its ability to compete against @entity8 and @entity9 , which agreed to a merger in february			1
@entity1 's proposed combination , which is subject to government review , could improve its internet service by pushing its existing u-verse tv subscribers into video - over - satellite service , and thereby free up bandwidth on its telecommunications network			1
the acquisition would help it further reap the benefits of that alliance			0
with 5.7 million u-verse tv customers and 20.3 million @entity2 customers in the @entity33 , the combined entity would serve 26 million			1
that would make it the second - largest pay tv operator behind a combined @entity8 - @entity9 , which would serve 30 million			1
the companies expect the deal to close within 12 months			0
under the terms agreed to sunday , @entity2 shareholders will receive $ 28.50 per share in cash and $ 66.50 per share in @entity1 stock			2
the total transaction value is $ 67.1 billion , including @entity2 's net debt			1
the deal could face tough scrutiny from the @entity47 and antitrust regulators at the @entity49			0
unlike @entity8 and @entity9 - which do n't compete in the same territory - @entity1 's u-verse , offered in 22 states , does compete directly for tv customers with @entity2 , which is available nationwide			1
the combination would reduce consumers ' options for pay tv providers from four to three for about 25 percent of @entity33 households , according to @entity59 analyst @entity58			0
fewer competitors could result in higher prices , a situation that usually gives regulators cause for concern			0
@entity1 already has more than 5.7million tv subscribers			2
they would be moved over to @entity2 satellite dishes analysts have also questioned the strategic benefits of a deal that would give @entity1 a larger presence in the mature market for pay tv			2
last year , pay tv subscribers fell for the first time , dipping 0.1 percent to 94.6 million , according to @entity76			0
while @entity1 and @entity2 are doing better than cable companies at attracting tv subscribers , @entity2 's growth in the @entity33 has stalled while @entity1 is growing the fastest of any tv provider			1
long term , the deal may offer little help to @entity1 as viewers continue to watch more video online			2
@entity2 offers neither fixed - line nor mobile internet service , and its rights to airwave frequencies for satellite tv are not the kind that @entity1 can use to improve its mobile phone network			1
@entity1 ceo @entity94 has spoken exuberantly about how the growth of online video helps boost demand for its @entity98 and mobile services			0
last month , @entity1 entered a joint venture with the @entity101 to invest in online video services			0
@entity1 is based in @entity103			0
@entity2 would continue to be based in @entity105 , @entity106 , following the merger , the companies said .			2
