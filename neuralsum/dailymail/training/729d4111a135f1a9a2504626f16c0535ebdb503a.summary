by @entity0 published : 09:22 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 18:13 est , 3 september 2013 @entity1 dramatically escalated his plans for military action in @entity4 yesterday			1
the @entity6 president said proposed strikes against the regime were part of a ‘ broader strategy ’ to topple @entity11 , who is accused of killing hundreds of civilians with chemical weapons			1
the suggestion of ‘ regime change ’ emerged as tensions in the region were heightened further by the @entity19 firing of two missiles in the eastern @entity21 in the early hours of yesterday			0
but they also suggested there is already ‘ mission creep ’ in the planned @entity6 intervention in the wartorn country , reflecting the fears of @entity47 and @entity49 rebels who joined with @entity50 to defeat @entity51 over plans to join military action last week			1
despite the crushing blow to the prime minister ’s plans , @entity54 yesterday repeatedly refused to rule out doing more to support rebel leaders in @entity4			0
briefing : president @entity1 held talks with @entity34 senators @entity63 ( left ) and @entity64 about his plans to degrade the @entity4 regime sources said providing arms to the rebels – a move opposed earlier this year by more than 80 conservative @entity71 – was ‘ not on the cards ’			1
however , it is expected that @entity75 could provide more technical support and equipment , including chemical weapons protection kit , and assistance in areas opposition forces have taken from the regime			2
foreign secretary @entity83 told the @entity84 that @entity75 is already the second - largest donor to humanitarian causes in @entity4 and promised that ‘ we will do more ’			1
@entity75 remains ‘ highly active ’ in seeking an end to the violence , he told mps			0
@entity19 yesterday carried out a joint missile test with the @entity6 in the @entity21 , leading to heightened tensions in the region			0
the firing was part of a test of @entity19 ’s @entity98 defence system			0
the country ’s defence ministry said the system successfully detected and tracked a @entity104 medium - range guided missile			0
experts say the missile test is a sign @entity19 is taking seriously the possibility that any @entity6 air strikes could lead to retaliatory attacks , either by @entity4 itself or by its ally , @entity113 , in @entity114			2
out : @entity51 , pictured with @entity115 , announced in the wake of the commons vote that @entity75 would play no part in military action against @entity4 mr @entity1 stressed last night that his primary objective remained ‘ limited and proportional ’ attacks to degrade @entity4 ’s chemical weapons capabilities			1
but , suggesting he plans to boost the rebels to bring about regime change , he added : ‘ it also fits into a broader strategy that can bring about over time the kind of strengthening of the opposition and the diplomatic , economic and political pressure required – so that ultimately we have a transition that can bring peace and stability , not only to @entity4 but to the region			0
condemnation : @entity83 used @entity137 questions in the @entity138 to attack the @entity4 regime for preventing vital humanitarian aid from reaching refugees ‘ we have a broader strategy that will allow us to upgrade the capabilities of the opposition , allow @entity4 ultimately to free itself from the kinds of terrible civil war , death and activity that we ’ve been seeing on the ground			1
’ the @entity6 president ’s shift was welcomed by @entity34 senator @entity63 , who offered to help him avoid a humiliating defeat in @entity24 next week in exchange for a pledge to do more to back the rebels			1
@entity157 mayor @entity156 said he believed @entity24 would back mr @entity1 and insisted @entity158 should ‘ think again ’ about @entity75 involvement if @entity11 was confirmed as being behind the gas attacks			2
mr @entity51 said however : ‘ @entity158 spoke very clearly and it ’s important to respect the view of @entity158 , so i am not planning to return to @entity158 to ask again about @entity75 military action			1
’ @entity165 secretary - general ban ki - moon warned last night any ‘ punitive ’ action taken against @entity4 for an alleged chemical weapons attack would be illegal without @entity169 approval or a sound case for self - defence			2
‘ as i have repeatedly said , the @entity169 has primary responsibility for international peace and security , ’ @entity175 said			0
‘ the use of force is lawful only when in exercise of self - defence in accordance with article 51 of the @entity182 and or when the @entity169 approves such action			0
’ he also warned that a military strike against @entity4 could unleash more turmoil and bloodshed in a crisis that has already killed more than 100,000 .			0
