' i am a grammar snob			0
capital letters , commas - everything has to be perfect , i ca n't stand it [ texting ] otherwise			1
so it takes too long so i just call instead , ' she told @entity23 in an interview about her new collaboration with @entity26			2
grammar police : @entity7 said she is extremely fussy when it comes to spelling and grammar the @entity32 phone brand might not be as glamorous as her usual collaborations , but as demonstrated in the designs , the 39 - year - old has managed to inject some serious style into everyone 's favourite accessory			1
the collection draws inspiration from the supermodel 's own wardrobe and is intended to capture her classic , understated style in a range of leather and metallic cases			0
' i wanted to do something that was feminine , not tacky and plastic , ' she said			0
the designs are simple and subtle and all come in the fash pack 's favourite colour : black			2
they include a patent crocodile skin design with gold embellishment that @entity7 designed around her favourite vintage lighter ; a bold metallic , star case that was inspired by a diamond necklace from @entity7 ’s jewellery box ; and the simple anchor emblem taken from a tattoo on her wrist that has become her personal monogram across the whole range			1
tech savvy : she may be busy partying and posing for high fashion campaigns but @entity7 still loves playing on the apps on her phone ' the range is a reflection of my personal style and every piece was inspired by something i already own and wear			2

in true fashionista style , @entity7 changes phone accessories to match her outfit - even down to the colour of her zip			1
she said she would never wear a dress with a gold zip with a silver phone case as she confessed : ' i am a bit @entity91 about not mixing silver and gold			0
' and whilst she may not partake in texting very often , @entity7 is somewhat addicted to her smartphone apps			1
she is on picture sharing site @entity95 but uses a codename to maintain her privacy			2
