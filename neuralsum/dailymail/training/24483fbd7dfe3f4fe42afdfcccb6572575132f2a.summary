strolling hand - in - hand on a summer ’s afternoon , they look like a couple without a care in the world			0
but this is the married co-founder of online fashion emporium @entity6 , which counts the @entity8 and prime minister ’s wife @entity9 as customers			0
the woman by @entity14 ’s side is his former @entity15 – 15 years his junior – and together they have set up home just a short distance from his estranged wife			1
@entity14 ( pictured left and right ) has moved in with his former @entity15 ( left ) , just around the corner from his estranged wife @entity23 ( right , pictured before their split ) it was announced in march that mr @entity14 , 46 , one the @entity28 ’s richest men , had parted from @entity23 , his wife of ten years			1
he was said to have left the £ 8.3 million six - bedroom property in @entity31 , @entity32 , that he shared with mrs @entity33 , 41 , and their two daughters			1
at the time , friends said the couple were living apart on civilised terms and were trying to make their marriage work			2
but now it has emerged that mr @entity14 is renting a five - bedroom house with ms @entity42 , 31 , in @entity31 , close to his former family home			1
it is understood that divorce proceedings have begun			0
she declined to comment when approached by @entity48			0
earlier this year , it was suggested the couple had drifted apart because the tycoon had been travelling a lot due to work commitments			0
but now a source has told @entity48 that mrs @entity33 is hurt , angry and feels betrayed by her husband			1
‘ the marriage only ended a few months ago and now @entity14 is moving into a property so close			1
they might as well have set up home at the bottom of the garden , ’ a source said			2
@entity63 ? : mrs @entity33 is said to be hurt , angry and feels betrayed by her husband after he moved into this rented property with his pa mr @entity14 founded @entity6 – which stands for @entity66 – with friend @entity67 in 2000			1

the great - grandson of retailer @entity78 , mr @entity14 is said to be worth £ 448 million and his wife would be likely to get a large chunk of his fortune			2
however , because most of his wealth is tied up in the business , there are fears that any divorce settlement that forces mr @entity14 to sell part of his 9.28 per cent stake in the business could rock its share price			2
