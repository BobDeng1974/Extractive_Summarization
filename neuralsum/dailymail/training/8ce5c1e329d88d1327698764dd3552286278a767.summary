the first letters started to arrive in the summer of 2010 , accusing mr @entity9 of using his position as coach to get his son @entity65 on the team			1
soon other letters arrived , but this time , instead of complaining about the team and his coaching abilities , the letters included personal information about the family			0
' i know where your wife goes every day			0
i know where your daughter goes to dance school , ' mrs @entity38 said one of the letters claimed			0

the note arrived on the same day as one addressed to his father , and it said : ' if your father does n't step back , i 'm going to kill him			0
' the second letter , addressed to mr @entity9 , said : ' i made it my life 's goal now to observe your family on a 24/7 basis ... just tell your wife and kids to watch themselves , especially at night			1

' during the terrifying ordeal , @entity20 , who the family considered a friend , was regularly texting mrs @entity38 and even came to her 40th birthday party			2
but police , who believed the letters to the family , and the one to the school , were coming from the same source , began to suspect the new friend was n't all that she seemed			1

to get proof , mrs @entity38 pretended to be collecting addresses for a fundraising event , to get @entity20 to provide a handwriting sample			2
