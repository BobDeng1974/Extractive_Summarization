trudging through @entity1 's vast showrooms looking for the right bunkbeds for the kids ' bedroom can be a wearying chore			1
so it can be a blessed relief to flop down on one of the beds or sofas on display for a few minutes rest - even if its not strictly ' try before you buy '			0
but on the other side of the world from the flatpack firm 's native @entity17 , these @entity14 customers really do seem to have shopped until they 've dropped			0
blessed relief : a @entity14 shopper sleeps on a bed in the showroom of the @entity1 store on @entity24 , @entity14 room for two : a woman curls up with her baby on a rather ruffled bed in the cool , air - conditioned @entity1 store no pictures ! a woman hides her face with a fan after kicking off her shoes and putting her feet up on a sofa desperate for some rest : this shopper does n't care that the bed he 's sleeping on has not yet been made @entity39 : even with air conditioning cooling the pace , sleeping on leather is risky run out of beds ? a woman takes her nap on a high - backed swivel chair in one of the shop 's mocked - up rooms tiring : another pair of shattered shoppers flop over the flatpack furniture lounging : this corner sofa is so sumptuous and expansive that there 's room for two total strangers to sleep @entity1 's massive @entity24 store - one of the world 's biggest - is a favourite siesta spot for stressed city slickers looking for a place to rest from the mid-summer heat			1
most do n't want to buy anything , but have instead visited for the express purpose of taking a nap , catching up with friends , or just to bask in the cool air - conditioned climate			0
visiting @entity1 without the need for a @entity71 bookcase or endless storage solutions , but simply to enjoy the comfort of a @entity75 frame or the bounce of a @entity77 may seem ludicrous , but in @entity14 it 's a growing trend			2
despite the country 's burgeoning economic might , many @entity14 still live in cramped conditions in old - fashioned homes , as a state - mandated building boom churns out millions of properties normal people ca n't afford			0
@entity1 has n't taken any measures against people making themselves at home , because it sees it as a future investment			1
cool : most of the visitors have come to take advantage of the shop 's air conditioning - an expensive luxury accommodating : staff do n't try to remove them , their presence is seen as an investment in the brand 's future cushion cuddlers : many @entity14 can not yet afford the luxuries of @entity1 furniture , but they hope to soon @entity108 sofa : there is plenty of room in the huge @entity24 store - one of the world 's largest - for all the sleepers stretching out : many @entity14 still live in cramped conditions in old - fashioned homes couch potatoes : @entity1 is the world 's largest furniture company , with profits last year of £ 2.7billion much of the increase in those profits has been driven by expansion into new markets like @entity123 and @entity14 so even if these customers ca n't afford a @entity71 bookcase now , @entity1 is betting they will be able to soon ... @entity1 was founded by 87 - year - old @entity126 in 1943			1
it is now the world ’s largest furniture retailer , recording an annual net profit of £ 2.7billion in 2013 , from sales of £ 22.1billion in 44 countries			2
it opened up its first shop in @entity14 in 1999 and the country is now home to eight of the top - 10 largest @entity138 in the world			0
there are more @entity1 catalogues than bibles printed each year , and it is said that one in ten @entity143 is now conceived in an @entity1 bed .			2

staff at the store make no effort to remove the sleeping visitors
they believe their presence in the store is an investment in future sales
@entity1 profits were up last year thanks largely to gains in new markets
