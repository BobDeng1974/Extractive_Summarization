by @entity0 an increase to medical research funding by the @entity3 means that research into the causes of cancer using vinegar flies can be sped up			2
the research looks in to cell growth using the insects , and the findings will later be tested on mice and eventually implemented in human treatment			0
according to news.com.au @entity13 is working with teams from the @entity15 in @entity16 and the @entity17 to examine a gene which plays a key role in allowing the formation of cancers			0
vinegar flies are being used in research which hopes to discover more about a certain gene which can affect cancer growth the @entity27 gene has been identified as one which drives cell growth and allows cells to overgrow and cancer to take over if it 's turned up too high			1
in cancer cells the gene is often too present , and dr @entity35 told the website vinegar flies are ideal to use to work out of to turn the gene on and off			1
they are suitable because they present the same @entity27 gene as in mice and humans , and understanding the function of the gene could later lead to the development of new cancer drugs			1
the @entity27 gene present in flies are also present in mice and humans and may help researches develop new cancer drugs ' cell growth is the first step in a cancer taking off in a person			1
if we can stop that , then that â€™s how we are going to save lives , ' said dr @entity59			0
the vinegar flies also offer an inexpensive and quick insight into how the gene functions			2
this project is one of 11 studies which have been funded by a $ 3million grant in the form of the @entity3 's grants - in - aid program			0
ceo @entity70 said the grants are all from donors , the website reported .			0

vinegar flies are used to learn more about the growth of cancer - causing cells
@entity27 gene is present in flies , mice and humans
*ability* to *switch* this gene on or off could lead to new cancer treatments
