by @entity0 this dramatic footage captured by police officers on the beat arresting criminals and helping victims was today released , as @entity6 begins the world 's biggest trial of uniform - mounted cameras			1
but privacy groups today raised concerns over how recordings made on the cameras will be handled , whether people will know they are being filmed - and if they will be able to access their own copy			1
the trial will see 500 cameras distributed to ten @entity19 boroughs			1
firearms officers will also be testing the cameras in training with a view to wearing them if the pilot is successful			1
it follows criticism of the force following the death 29 - year - old @entity29 at the hands of armed officers , which sparked the 2011 riots in the capital and further afield			1
@entity36 commissioner sir @entity35 said the cameras would result in speedier justice for victims , particularly in cases of domestic violence			1
' our experience of using cameras already shows that people are more likely to plead guilty when they know we have captured the incident ' sir @entity35 , metropolitan police commissioner ‘ our experience of using cameras already shows that people are more likely to plead guilty when they know we have captured the incident			1
‘ that speeds up justice , puts offenders behind bars more quickly and protects potential victims			0
@entity73 captures events in a way that ca n't be represented on paper in the same detail			0
‘ and it has been shown the mere presence of this type of video can often defuse potentially violent situations without the need for force to be used			2
trial : constable @entity86 ( left ) and constable @entity88 pictured in their police car wearing body - worn video cameras , ahead of a year - long pilot scheme by the @entity36 , at @entity93 in @entity19 up close : the trial will see 500 cameras distributed to ten @entity19 boroughs			1
firearms officers will also be testing the cameras in training with a view to wearing them if the pilot is successful fighting crime : the @entity36 says the new cameras will result in speedier justice for victims fire : the trial follows criticism of the force following the death 29 - year - old @entity29 at the hands of armed officers , which sparked the 2011 riots in @entity19 ( pictured ) and further afield ‘ i believe it will also show our officers at their best , dealing with difficult and dangerous situations every day but it will also provide clearer evidence when it 's been alleged that we got things wrong			1
that has to be in both our own and the public 's interest			0
’ controversial incident : the @entity36 wants to repair the damage to its relationship with the community caused by the shooting of @entity29 ( pictured ) the debate over the more widespread use of body - worn cameras by @entity135 police comes after a jury at the inquest into @entity139 's death concluded in january that he had been lawfully killed after being shot dead by @entity36 marksmen - a conclusion which prompted outrage from his family and supporters			1
none of the officers involved in the incident in @entity19 were wearing body cameras			1
the @entity36 has continued its efforts to attempt to repair the damage to its relationship with the community caused by the controversial shooting			1
speaking ahead of the pilot , the @entity36 said officers taking part in the pilot must comply with guidelines about when cameras are to be used , but that they will not be permanently switched on			1
@entity157 is the first to take delivery of the new cameras , from today , with further trials in @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169			2
officers will store material from each incident and keep it on file for a month unless required for evidence purposes			2
sir @entity35 said the cameras could have helped in the @entity139 case			2
he told @entity178 : ‘ i think as we saw in the recent incident - fairly recent incident - regarding @entity29 , there was a great dispute about what @entity29 was holding at the time he was shot , and this hopefully would have helped to resolve that			1
’ praise : the cameras have been welcomed by former shadow home secretary @entity190 ( pictured ) , who said their use would have avoided the @entity194 controversy ever taking place admitted swearing : the @entity194 affair happened in 2012 when former chief whip @entity197 ( pictured ) was told by police officers that he could not ride his bicycle through the main gates of @entity201 if officers are found to regularly fail to switch on their cameras when they should do it will be treated as a disciplinary offence , he added			1
sir @entity35 said the cameras would ‘ capture the reality of some of the horrible things we have to deal with from time to time ’			2
civil liberties campaigners may observe some irony in the launch of body cameras for police			1
that is because officers have previously used anti-terrorism laws to stop the public taking pictures of them , which is actually legal			0
police were warned against using the @entity221 five years ago to stop people taking pictures of officers			2
@entity225 said in a review of anti-terror laws in 2009 that officers who force photographers to delete images could face prosecution			0
@entity232 of the @entity221 came into force that year , banning photography of police that could be useful to terrorists			0
the maximum sentence is ten years in jail			0
campaigners warned at the time that it could stop the media recording protests or evidence of heavy - handed policing			0
big brother watch said today that nobody ' should be subjected to this sort of surveillance without being fully aware it is taking place and how they can access a copy for themselves '			0
the privacy group did add that the cameras could improve accountability of the police , but only if they are ‘ implemented properly , particularly with regard to whether officers are able to access the memory cards or tamper with the footage in another way ’			1
however , the cameras found a strong supporter in the face of former shadow home secretary @entity190			0
the staunch libertarian said their use would have avoided the @entity194 controversy two years ago ever taking place			0
mr @entity190 said : ' had it been recorded then the dispute would n't exist			0
we would n't be arguing about who said what			0
' the cameras have also been welcomed by former shadow home secretary @entity190 , who said their use would have avoided the @entity194 controversy ever taking place			0
he told @entity278 : ' if there 's a disputed event between the police and public there should be video evidence available			2
‘ and if it 's not there then there will be an assumption that it 's not been provided , that the police are culpable			0
' @entity194 is the obvious case			0
had it been recorded then the dispute would n't exist			0
we would n't be arguing about who said what			0
' the @entity194 affair happened in 2012 when former chief whip @entity197 was told by police officers that he could not ride his bicycle through the main gates of @entity201			1
exactly what happened next is still a matter of legal dispute , with 58 - year - old mr @entity197 admitting to have sworn - but , crucially , denying ever calling officers ‘ plebs ’			2
pc @entity304 , 53 , a @entity6 diplomatic protection officer , was jailed for one year in february after he admitted lying about witnessing the row that ultimately led to the resignation of mr @entity197			0
@entity307 , acting director of @entity308 , told @entity309 today : ‘ no member of the public should be subjected to this sort of surveillance without being fully aware it is taking place and how they can access a copy for themselves			0
‘ there have been too many instances in the past where officers have prevented members of the public from filming incidents involving the police , citing nonsense claims that it is illegal for them to do so			2
if the police want to gain public support for body worn cameras , then the right to film must work both ways			2
‘ however , if these cameras are implemented properly , particularly with regard to whether officers are able to access the memory cards or tamper with the footage in another way , there is potential for this to improve accountability of the police			1
‘ that is not to say that they do not risk also damaging the relationship between the police and the public , and the potential for abuse is clear , but if properly regulated , they can improve protection for both police officers and members of the public			1
