the good news for all concerned in @entity1 was that it had stopped raining			2
@entity2 had raised fears on the eve of the game and as the downpour continued into the night the @entity7 manager was n't the only one casting anxious glances skywards			1
this is a big day for the new @entity1 and they do not want it washed out			0
@entity2 had raised fears over the playing surface at @entity1 's @entity14 on monday night the @entity14 has a poor surface and groundstaff have worked hard to help it drain after heavy rainfall @entity18 celebrates during @entity1 's 3 - 1 win against @entity7 at the @entity20 last month a recent game against @entity25 had been cancelled and because the pitch at the @entity14 is a notoriously poor surface , with so much going on beneath it : car parks , swimming pools , etc groundstaff worked through the night to help it drain as they prepare for what they hope will be a famous victory , one which will see them into the last eight of the @entity36 for the first time since 2004 , when they went on to the final and lost to @entity41 's @entity40			1
much has happened to @entity1 since then			0
they almost dropped into the third tier of @entity45 football and faced extinction before @entity48 billionaire @entity47 came to the rescue and got them moving in the right direction once again			0
the first leg result against @entity7 was confirmation that the @entity55 project is still on track , having survived a change of direction and an exodus of top players like @entity61 and @entity62 last summer			2
@entity48 billionaire @entity47 rescued the club from almost dropping into the @entity45 @entity64 @entity40 celebrate winning the @entity36 in 2004 after beating @entity1 in the final in @entity66 @entity1 wideman @entity67 shields the ball away from @entity40 midfielder @entity69 during the final @entity62 and @entity61 both left @entity1 for @entity71 and @entity72 respectively no club in the @entity36 era has surrendered a two - goal lead after playing the first leg away and @entity78 's team prides itself on tight defence			1
they have conceded only once in the last 12 home games and are quietly confident history will not be rewritten , with @entity78 expected to enhance his reputation for caution by making a tweak or two to his team to make it even more solid			0
if they park the @entity90 as smartly as they did at the @entity20 , it promises to be one of the great nights in @entity1 's recent history			1
@entity95 favourites to progress @entity1 boss @entity78 has guided his team to eleven clean sheets in their last twelve home games @entity99 celebrates the win over @entity7 and @entity1 will be confident history will not be rewritten the 18,000 capacity stadium is sold - out , which rarely happens			1
there were fewer than 6,000 in to see them beat nine - man @entity104 on friday , a 3 - 0 win which kept them in touch with the @entity109 leaders			0
despite its rich history , @entity1 will never be one of the @entity45 's football hotbeds			2
it is a unique club set in the playground of the privileged , where most of the local residents are far wealthier than any of the players and many of them more recognisable			0
in @entity119 , the most famous of the principality 's districts , you would hardly know there was a big @entity36 game on			2
the stadium is set in @entity125 , a district reclaimed from the sea in the 1970s , and cut off by a tunnel from the more recognisable sights such as @entity129 , the @entity130 , a harbour crammed with super-yachts and the @entity132			0
@entity99 and @entity133 congratulate goalscorer @entity134 during friday 's 3 - 0 win over @entity104 work has started this week in preparation for the @entity138 in may			1
@entity2 's first return to the club he managed for seven years until 1994 fails to make the social calendar for many of those who settle here to enjoy tax - free life in the world 's smallest monarchy			1
@entity148 has devoted it 's pages to tuesday 's clash @entity151 , the ruling monarch , continues to support the club he used to run and will be at the game , as the @entity45 attempt to claim another football triumph against the @entity157 after @entity158 were knocked out by @entity159 last week			2
@entity45 sports paper @entity148 devoted its first five pages to the game with the disciplinary saga of @entity159 idol @entity164 relegated to page 6			0
instead , rival strikers @entity165 and @entity18 were pitched head - to - head on the front			0
at @entity14 on the eve of the game , @entity2 was met by @entity1 's vice-president @entity171 and presented with a framed picture designed to commemorate his work at the club , where he won the @entity45 title in 1988			1
in an interview with @entity177 , last month , ahead of the first - leg , @entity171 hailed @entity2 as ' one of the iconic coaches of modern football ' but the @entity7 manager is not big on sentiment			1
he was wounded by the 3 - 1 defeat in the first leg and aware that history is against a glorious comeback , but the noises from the @entity7 camp were all about believing the impossible to be possible			2
with their array of attacking talent , scoring three goals seems an achievable target			0
keeping @entity1 at bay at the other end while doing so , may be a different proposition			0
@entity2 watches on during his first match in @entity200 competition as @entity1 manager - a victory in 1988			1

@entity1 host @entity7 in @entity36 last 16 on tuesday night
the club 's 18,000 capacity @entity14 has sold out for the clash
no club has surrended a two - goal lead after playing first leg away
