president @entity0 this morning put a human face on the harmful effects climate change can have on public health - his daughter @entity5			1
while making the case that higher temperatures lead to increases in wildfires , which send allergy - causing particulates into the air that can lead to greater and more serious incidents of asthma , the president recalled his own child 's run - in with the disease as a toddler			1
' well you know , @entity5 had asthma when she was four , and because we had good health insurance , we were able to knock it out early , ' the president told @entity23 ’ chief health correspondent , dr. @entity24 , in an interview that aired on @entity26			1
@entity0 today said he can ' relate to ... the fear a parent has when your four - year - old daughter comes up to you and says , " @entity51 , i 'm having trouble breathing			1
" ' the president said he can ' relate to ... the fear a parent has when your four - year - old daughter comes up to you and says , " @entity51 , i 'm having trouble breathing			1
" ' ' the fright you feel is terrible			0
' @entity0 said the health scare resulted in a single trip to the emergency room for his daughter - who at the age of 16 now lives a full and an active life , inhaler free - but other children are n't so fortunate			1
they they find themselves in and out the emergency room several times a year			1
and those episodes end up costing taxpayers			0
so it 's an all - around benefit to society if they can be prevented , he argued			2
the president told a similar version of the story to @entity80 ' chief medical correspondent dr. @entity79 during an interview that ran this morning			0
' i 'm a dad like everybody else , ' the president told @entity79 as he recounted the terrifying emergency room visit			1
in putting front and center the personal cost of inaction , @entity0 is attempting to galvanize support for his climate change initiatives			1
' while most @entity93 see climate change hitting their communities through extreme weather events – from more severe droughts and wildfires to more powerful hurricanes and record heat waves – there are other threats climate change poses to the @entity93 people , ' the @entity91 said in a fact sheet outlining the new public health campaign			1
the percentage of @entity93 with asthma has ' more than doubled ' in the last three decades , the fact sheet stated , ' and climate change is putting these individuals and many other vulnerable populations at greater risk of landing in the hospital			2
' most at risk for climate change related health problems are children , the elderly , the poor , people who are already sick ' and some communities of color , ' the @entity91 said			1
' rising temperatures can lead to more smog , longer allergy seasons , and an increased incidence of extreme - weather - related injuries			1
' @entity5 , now 16 , is pictured here in 2012 playing tennis , one of her favorite sports			2
the president said her health scare resulted in a single asthma - related trip to the emergency room but she now lives a full and an active life , inhaler free at a @entity137 college yesterday , @entity0 put a finer point on the argument and contended that ' all of our families are going to be vulnerable ' to global warming induced health risks because ' you ca n’t cordon yourself off from air or from climate			1
' the president said that as part of his administration 's effort to engage the public on the topic it would make available data from the @entity156 and other government agencies showing the link between rising temperatures and human health			2
that data will be used by tech companies , including @entity163 and @entity164 , to create applications @entity93 can use to ' educate and protect ' themselves , @entity0 said			0
his administration will also convene a @entity167 and @entity168 this spring , led by attorney general @entity169 , that will bring medial professionals and academics together for a discussion on how to reduce the impacts of climate change on the public 's health			0
' so the bottom line is we all need to do our part , ' @entity0 told participants of a @entity182 roundtable focused on the issue yesterday			0
president @entity0 , center left , participates in a roundtable discussion on the impacts of climate change on public health with @entity169 , @entity93 surgeon general , left , @entity189 , administrator of the @entity190 ( @entity190 ) , second from right , and @entity191 , sustainability coordinator at @entity192 , third from right , at @entity182 in @entity137 on tuesday @entity0 said ' all of our families are going to be vulnerable ' to global warming induced health risks because ' you ca n’t cordon yourself off from air or from climate			1
' @entity169 said , ' this is a personal issue for me because when i was young one of my favorite uncles ... he died from a severe asthma attack ' ' obviously , this administration has been aggressive in using the administrative authorities that we currently ' to put a dent in pollution , he continued			2
by raising fuel efficiency standards and working to reduce carbon emissions , ' @entity0 said			0
' but we ’ve got a lot more work to do if we ’re going to deal with this problem in an effective way and make sure that our families and our kids are safe			0
' speaking after @entity0 , @entity169 asserted that hotter weather ' can mean worse air in cities , and more smog and more ozone , ' in addition to more wildfire smoke			0
' earlier springs and longer summers mean longer allergy seasons , ' he said			0
' and more asthma attacks mean more days of school missed			0
they mean more days of work missed			0
they mean more costly trips to the doctor			0
' and they most importantly mean more scary moments for parents and for children			0
' @entity169 said asthma is a disease that has taken a toll on his family , as well			0
' this is a personal issue for me because when i was young one of my favorite uncles -- actually he was very dear to me as a child -- he died from a severe asthma attack , ' @entity169 explained			2
' and it ’s also personal to me because i ’ve cared for many patients over the years who have suffered from asthma and have seen firsthand how frightening it can be to suddenly be wheezing and fighting for every breath ... and the impacts of climate change could make this situation worse			2
