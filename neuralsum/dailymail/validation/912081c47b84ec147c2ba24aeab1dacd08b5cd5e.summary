from abseiling onto traffic - jammed roads to fitness training on city pavements , @entity1 ' newest video shows its ' elite ' @entity6 squadron in action			1
the comical eight - minute video shows them practicing forced entries on unlocked doors , rappelling down the sides of buildings and bizarrely using large logs to help each other up walls			1
and the lack of a formal base does not deter the hapless extremists who make do with the side of a busy road in an unknown @entity23 location			0
' special ' : one recruit struggles to free himself from the rope he traversed down in a new video showing @entity1 ' elite fighting unit tactical training : with no formal base to hone their deadly skills , the extremists make do with main roads in an unknown @entity23 location teamwork : extremist soldiers undergo strange training scnearios in the eight - minute propaganda video which shows the soldiers helping each other up walls with a log tight squeeze : after his overweight colleague throws a flash - bang grenade into this abandoned house , a @entity44 soldier takes the unusual entry route through the window taskmaster : the soldiers ' commander - dressed completely in black - forces them to crawl on pavements as he literally walks all over his recruits death - defying : the militants practice high - octane manoeuvres like rappelling down tall buildings in unison to show off their military prowess showboating : one soldier shows off by displaying the black @entity44 flag as he hangs upside down , hundreds of feet above the ground below here the recruits are moulded into the terror group 's deadliest soldiers by a commander who makes them army crawl on pavements and - literally - walks all over them			1
one sheepishly looks to the camera as his colleague kicks open an unlocked gate and another seems to lose his balance as he kneels to take his position inside			0
and there is little secrecy about this @entity6 unit who train in front of hundreds of bemused onlookers			0
a triumphant soldier even showboats to the crowd below by holding up the notorious black flag used by @entity87 groups as he hangs upside down - hundreds of feet above the ground below			2
but one of his partners in terror struggles to free himself from the rope he traversed down , while some overweight soldiers look a little sluggish running through traffic			2
the formation of such a force is not a cause for concern according to former @entity101 soldier @entity100 who described the footage as a ' very funny ' pr film			1
the man who uses the name as a pseudonym to protect his identity told @entity108 : ' just looking at the guys as they handle weapons ... it is clear that not even regular soldiers have much to worry about from these guys			1
' and although @entity116 's aspiration to train a deadly @entity6 battalion is worrying , it is mostly a ' display of force for a local and international audience ' according to director of international security studies at security think - tank @entity122			1
daring : one @entity44 soldier in army fatigues rappels upside down as hundreds of onlookers watch from below hardened : the ' @entity6 ' unit 's intensive training culminates in the recruits traversing a narrow and shallow river with their weapons show of force : such public displays of dominance ' makes people both fear them , but also makes them an attractive force for people to want to go and join ' , one defence expert told @entity108 elite : @entity141 from @entity122 said the propaganda video is a chance for @entity1 to glorify not only its tactics and soldiers - but the weapons it has seized leader : one @entity1 commander - the only one not masked in the entire video - addresses the audience flanked by four menacing @entity1 soldiers deadly : the @entity1 soldiers - who trained in a busy @entity23 city - also carry out heavy weapons training in a slightly more remote location @entity141 told @entity108 : ' they are showing off their capabilities and captured equipment given the @entity159 issue @entity161 rifles on display			1
' by showing off their men 's ability , training and captured equipment , they are demonstrating that they are a strong force that is still in control of its territory and are an effective force			0
' this makes people both fear them , but also makes them an attractive force for people to want to go and join			0
' previous footage from @entity116 's training camps believed to be in @entity179 showed recruits disguised as bushes			1
other drills involved the extremists performing unnecessary forward rolls over mounds which would leave them far more exposed to enemy fire than keeping low with a commando crawl			0
while in some scenes , the recruits have a crack at martial arts by taking it turns to smash wall tiles over their own heads			0
the terror group , which has been determined to portray itself as a formal military force , showed off its ' sniper battalion ' in a much more threatening display in late february			1
