by @entity0 published : 05:37 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 05:49 est , 5 june 2013 two - year - old twin sisters are not able to enjoy playing in the park or to go on holiday because the excitement could kill them			1
@entity5 and @entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , are the only twins in the @entity10 to have a severe form of epilepsy called @entity13			1
seizures can lead to @entity15 ( sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients ) and the condition leads to delays in development , feeding problems , sleep problems and behavioural problems			1
@entity6 and @entity24 have a severe form of epilepsy called @entity13			1
it causes seizures , developmental delays , behavioural problems and feeding difficulties			1
they are pictured with parents , @entity34 and @entity35 triggers for the seizures include excitement and extremes of temperature , meaning the girls must be strictly monitored			1
mother @entity35 , 36 , said : ' the worst case scenario is that they can have a fit and die in their beds , or that the oxygen supply to the brain stops and leaves them brain damaged			0
' at their worst we were calling out ambulance after ambulance , but now they just have one or two fits a month each			0
it 's a big improvement			0
' we try and keep things as normal as possible for them but it 's hard , especially because there 's two of them with @entity64			0
' they see each other not walking and talking and think that it 's normal			0
' we have to be on high alert at all times and avoid their triggers , we have to constantly watch them - it 's exhausting			1
' @entity74 and @entity5 's seizures are triggered by excitement and extremes of temperature meaning that their parents constantly have to ensure that they are not getting over excited and that they are not too hot the twins experienced their first seizures when they went on holiday to @entity83 at nine - months - old			1
they were diagnosed at @entity84 in @entity85 when they got home @entity5 and @entity6 experienced their first seizure on a holiday to @entity83 when they were nine - months - old			1
ms @entity6 , a project manager for a building company , explained : ' @entity5 had a fit first			1
it lasted about 20 minutes which is a long @entity95 just had no idea what was happening			0
we did n't even know the ambulance number			0
' the hospitals in @entity83 are not like they are over here			0
they told us to get a taxi or drive there ourselves as an ambulance could take over an hour to get to us			0
we had to carry her in on foot			0
@entity13 is a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy that begins in infancy			1
children with @entity111 tend to have normal development as babies but development starts to plateau when they are in their second year of life			0
individuals with @entity64 syndrome face a higher incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients ( @entity15 )			2
they ofen also experience other conditions including developmental delays , sleeping difficulties , chronic infections and difficulty feeding			1
there is currently no cure and treatment options are limited - they mainly involve using anti-epilepsy drugs to treat the seizures			1
@entity132 is known about the long term prognosis of people with @entity13			1
' we were in there for what felt like forever because no one could speak any @entity139			0
' the next day @entity6 had a staring episode			1
her eyes were rolling and we could n't distract her by doing anything			0
we did n't realise it at the time but that 's another kind of seizure			0
' it was our first family holiday since the girls had been born , and holidays abroad are a no - no now unless we know there will be really good air conditioning			2
' when the family returned to @entity154 they visited their gp who assured them that some children have fits , but that it could be a febrile convulsion that a lot of children have once in their life			0
but the twins ' fits became more and more frequent			0
eventually they were referred to @entity84 in @entity85 for tests on their brain activity			0
ms @entity6 said : ' @entity6 had a fit where she looked to one side while we were at the hospital			1
as soon as the doctor saw that he suspected it was @entity13			1
' they told us not to go home and look it up , but of course i did			0
' i was absolutely devastated			0
to think that you have normal children only to be told at nine - months - old that they have a life limiting form of genetic illness that may cause them to need care for the rest of their lives - it was horrendous			2
' tests confirmed our worst fears as we tried to carry on as normally as we could whilst carrying the huge burden that our girls were seriously ill. ' @entity132 is known about the long term prognosis of people with @entity13 but they tend to have normal development until they are two - years - old at which point their development plateaus now , the seizures are controlled by medication and the twins have far fewer fits			1
in the future , the children may be eligible for treatment using a special diet , known as a ketogenic diet			1
the ketogenic diet is an eating plan which forces the body to burn stored fat instead of glucose			1
this is achieved by making fat products the primary food that is consumed and by limiting the amount of carbohydrates eaten			2
it is not known exactly why this can prevent seizures but it is known that it works in some patients but not in others			2
they are at constant risk of @entity15 - sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients - which is particularly common in people with this form of epilepsy the twins ' seizures are now successfully controlled with medication meaning that they each only have two or three fits each month about a third of children who are on the diet become seizure - free , while another third improve but still have some seizures			1
the rest either do not respond or find it too difficult to stick to the diet			2
it is thought that following this diet also causes children to be more alert			2
some people can be weaned off the diet after about two years			2
however , there can be side effects to the diet such as dehydration , constipation , kidney stones and gall stones			2
when they are older , the twins might be eligible for treatment using a special diet called a ketogenic diet - this is a high - fat , low - carbohydrate diet which forces the body to run off stored fat rather than glucose it is not known why the diet reduces seizures , but in a third of children it stops them altogether and a further third see significant improvements in their symptoms ms @entity6 said : ' the ketogenic diet has rave reviews and eliminates the need for medicine in some cases			1
' some users find that once their children are off the medicine and on the diet they get their child back , as in they could speak and walk			0
' it 's a very strict diet and the twins are not eating the best anyway			0
it would be too hard for them to stick to at this age			0
' ms @entity6 , and the twins ' father @entity34 , 37 , a civil servant , are hoping that one day a cure will be found for @entity13			1
the twins ' parents , @entity34 and @entity35 ( pictured ) , hope that a cure will eventually be found for @entity13			2
they are pictured with their sister , @entity289 @entity291 , from the charity @entity13 @entity10 , said : ' @entity13 is one of the most catastrophic epilepsies with higher rates of @entity15 than other forms of epilepsy			2
' seizures are very difficult to control on conventional anti-epileptic medications and patients are prone to status epilepticus , seizures that last longer than 15 minutes			0
the longer a seizure lasts the higher the risks of the patient developing brain damage			0
' alongside the seizures , which present in the first year of life , patients with @entity13 also suffer varying degrees of learning disability and many are diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum			1
patients can also have mobility , communication and eating difficulties			0
' it is extremely unusual for twins to be diagnosed with the condition and out of a membership of over 200 families @entity5 and @entity74 are our only twins			2

@entity5 and @entity6 , from @entity8 , both have @entity13
their seizures can be triggered by excitement and extremes of temperature
the syndrome also causes developmental delays and behavioural problems
their seizures are now successfully controlled using medication
may be eligible for treatment with special high - fat diet when they are older
