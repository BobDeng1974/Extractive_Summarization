by @entity0 published : 08:38 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 09:26 est , 27 january 2014 forget being sneezed on : government scientists are deliberately giving dozens of volunteers the flu by squirting the live virus straight up their noses			1
it may sound bizarre , but the rare type of research is a step in the quest for better flu vaccines			1
it turns out that how the body fends off influenza remains something of a mystery			0
' vaccines are working , but we could do better , ' said dr @entity20 of the @entity21 , who is leading the study that aims to infect up to 100 adults over the next year			1
contagion : test patient @entity25 , 26 , is sprayed with a live flu virus as part of a study at the @entity21 to improve vaccines against the seasonal illness wait a minute : @entity31 is sweeping the country , so why not just study the already sick ? that would n't let scientists measure how the immune system reacts through each step of infection , starting with that first exposure to the virus			1
it 's not an experiment to be taken lightly			0
after all , the flu kills thousands of @entity43 a year			1
for safety , @entity44 chose a dose that produces mild to moderate symptoms — and accepts only volunteers who are healthy and no older than 50			2
and to avoid spreading the germs , participants must spend at least nine days quarantined inside a special isolation ward at the @entity21 hospital , their health closely monitored			1
they 're not released until nasal tests prove they 're no longer contagious			0
the incentive : about $ 3,000 to compensate for their time			1
room for improvement : dr @entity20 is leading the study at the @entity21			2
he says that while current vaccines are working , ' we could do better ' ' i received a very scolding email from my mother ' about signing up , @entity25 , 26 , said with a grin			0
' their standards are so high , i do n't believe i 'm in danger , ' added @entity25 , a restaurant worker from @entity70 , @entity71 ' i do n't get sick that often			2
' a masked and gloved @entity44 had @entity25 lie flat for about a minute			0
' it will taste salty			0
some will drip down the back of your throat , ' @entity20 said , before squeezing a syringe filled with millions of microscopic virus particles , floating in salt water , into each nostril			2
sure enough , a few days later @entity25 had the runny nose and achiness of mild flu			2
the best defense against influenza is a yearly vaccine , but it 's far from perfect			2
in fact , the vaccine is least effective in people age 65 and older — the group most susceptible to flu — probably because the immune system weakens with age			1
deadly : while non-fatal in most cases , the flu still kills thousands of @entity43 a year			1
above , dr @entity20 handles doses of the live virus understanding how younger adults ' bodies fight flu may help scientists determine what the more vulnerable elderly are missing , clues to help develop more protective vaccines for everyone , @entity20 explained			1
symptoms : a few days after getting sprayed with the virus , @entity25 started to experience a runny nose and achiness here 's the issue : the vaccine is designed to raise people 's levels of a particular flu - fighting antibody			1
it targets a protein that acts like the virus ' coat , called hemagglutinin — the ' h ' in @entity123 , the strain that caused the 2009 pandemic and that is causing the most illness so far this winter , too			2
but it 's not clear what antibody level is best to aim for — or whether a certain amount means you 're protected against getting sick at all , or that you 'd get a mild case instead of a severe one			2
' as mind - boggling as it is , we do n't know the answer to that , ' said dr. @entity136 , chief of @entity21 's @entity137			0
' we made some assumptions that we knew everything about flu			0
' just targeting hemagglutinin probably is n't enough , @entity20 added			0
already , some people in his study did n't get sick , despite remarkably low antibody levels , meaning something else must be protecting them			1
could it be antibodies against the ' n ' in flu 's name , the neuraminidase protein ? specific t cells that are activated to fight infection ? genes that switch on and off when a virus invades ? to begin finding out , @entity44 first developed a laboratory - grown copy of the h1n1 flu strain and sprayed different amounts into volunteers ' noses until he found the right dose to trigger mild flu			1
he hopes eventually to test the harsher @entity166 strain , too			0
now he 's infecting two groups — people with low antibody levels and those with high levels			0
some were recently vaccinated , and some were n't			0
he 'll compare how sick they get , how long they 're contagious and how the immune system jumps into action			0
called a human challenge study , this kind of research has n't been performed with flu viruses in the @entity43 for more than a decade , before scientists had ways as sophisticated to measure what happens			1
easy enough : @entity25 said he spent most of his time sick with the flu studying , watching tv and playing games with the other study participants ' it 's all going to add up to a better understanding of what you need to have to be protected against the flu , ' said dr. @entity194 , a flu specialist at the @entity196 who is closely watching the work			1
so far , @entity44 's patients are becoming contagious a day or two before they start feeling bad , one reason the flu spreads so easily			0
he sees a range of symptoms , from sniffles to a few days of moderate fever , fatigue and congestion			0
@entity25 's flu was pretty mild , and he passed the time studying , watching tv and playing games with the four other study participants infected this month			1
' all i had to do was read and watch movies , so it was n't that terrible , ' @entity25 said			0
' it was a really cool experience ' to see how research is done .			0

researchers are exposing volunteers to the live virus in order to study the virus from infection
they hope the results of the study will help them develop a more effective vaccine
thousands of @entity43 die each year from the flu and its even more dangerous among the elderly
participants in the study spend their entire time sick at a hospital and get paid $ 3,000
