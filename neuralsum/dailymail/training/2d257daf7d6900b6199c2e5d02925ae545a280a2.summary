by @entity0 published : 00:16 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 11:20 est , 16 september 2013 former treasury secretary and senior @entity1 economic adviser @entity2 , who was considered the leading candidate to succeed @entity5 as @entity7 chairman , has withdrawn from consideration , the @entity1 announced sunday			1
@entity2 ' withdrawal followed growing resistance from critics , including some members of the @entity14 committee that would need to back his nomination			1
a letter signed by 350 economists last week calling on president @entity19 to nominate @entity7 vice chair @entity20 to be the @entity7 's next chairman was designed to draw attention back to @entity20 amid signs that @entity19 was leaning toward nominating his former economic adviser @entity2			1
top choice : @entity27 federal reserve vice chair @entity20 speaking at a international monetary conference in @entity29 in june if chosen by president @entity19 and confirmed by the @entity14 , @entity20 will become the first woman to lead the @entity7 in the past , @entity19 has mentioned only one other candidate as possibly being under consideration : @entity33 , a former @entity7 vice chair			1
but @entity33 , 70 , has been considered a long shot			0
the administration also reached out to former treasury secretary @entity36 early in the process			1
@entity36 said he was not interested in being considered			0
@entity19 is expected to announce a nominee for the @entity7 chairmanship as early as this month			1
@entity5 's term ends january 31 , 2014			0
some economists said sunday that they think @entity2 ' exit significantly boosts the likelihood of a @entity45 nomination			2
' the odds that the president will nominate @entity20 are now much higher , ' said @entity48 , chief economist at @entity49			2
still , @entity48 added , ' there is a chance that there is some dark horse candidate , possibly @entity36			0
' @entity53 , chief economist at @entity54 and the author of several books on the @entity7 , said he saw @entity20 's selection as a virtual certainty			1
' there is a strong view that making a woman @entity7 chair is an important step , ' @entity53 said			1
' there is no question that her experience qualifies her for the role			0
' @entity2 and his allies had been engaged in an unusually public contest with @entity20 supporters , with each side lobbying the administration			1
competition : @entity2 has been hotly tipped for the role as @entity7 chairman but his candidature has been accompanied by strong criticism of his record in the @entity81 era an openly waged succession battle is something that the @entity7 , which will turn 100 in december , has never before witnessed			1
the selection of a chairman has long been a matter handled privately by a president and his senior advisers			0
in a statement sunday , @entity19 said he had accepted @entity2 ' decision			1
' @entity2 was a critical member of my team as we faced down the worst economic crisis since the @entity95 , and it was in no small part because of his expertise , wisdom and leadership that we wrestled the economy back to growth and made the kind of progress we are seeing today , ' @entity19 said			1
as director of the @entity106 , @entity2 oversaw the administration 's response to the economic and financial crisis early in @entity19 's first term			2
yet @entity2 faced strenuous opposition from some @entity113 , including some on the @entity114			2
@entity2 alluded to that opposition in a letter he sent sunday to @entity19 to formally withdraw from consideration			2
' i have reluctantly concluded that any possible confirmation process for me would be acrimonious and would not serve the interests of the @entity7 , the administration or ultimately , the interests of the nation 's ongoing economic recovery , ' @entity2 wrote			1
@entity2 ' ascent to the top of the list to succeed @entity5 rankled both opponents of the president as well as some liberal supporters			2
he has alienated colleagues in the past with a brusque and at times domineering style			0
unlike @entity5 , he 's not been known as a consensus - builder â€” one reason some critics had opposed his nomination			0
he was also seen as having been too cozy with @entity138			0
and @entity2 was roundly criticized for questioning women 's innate skills in math and science - comments that contributed to his forced resignation as @entity145 's president in 2006			2
@entity146 , co-founder of the women 's rights group @entity147 , welcomed @entity2 ' withdrawal , saying she hopes it serves as ' a reminder to all that sexism has no place anywhere in society and certainly not in the highest levels of our government			2
@entity158 called on @entity19 to nominate @entity20 , 67 , who has been closely aligned with @entity5 and has helped devise the @entity7 's low - interest rates policies			1
since joining the @entity7 's board as vice chair in 2010 , @entity20 has supported @entity5 's use of not only the @entity7 's traditional tool of short - term interest rates but also non-traditional tools designed to help the economy			1
these include bond purchases and guidance to investors about the likely direction of rates			0
time up : current federal reserve chairman @entity5 's term is up in january as early as this week , the @entity7 is expected to scale back its $ 85 billion - a - month in @entity176 and mortgage bond purchases			1
those purchases have been designed to keep long - term loan rates low to get people to borrow and spend and invest in the stock market			0
the low rates are credited with helping fuel a housing comeback , support economic growth , drive stocks to record highs and restore the wealth of many @entity27			0
@entity20 has long been considered a top candidate for the chairmanship in part because of her expertise as an economist , her background as a top bank regulator and her experience as vice chair			1
last week , more than 350 economists signed a letter to @entity19 calling on him to nominate @entity20			2
the letter was designed to draw attention back to @entity20 amid signs that @entity19 was leaning toward @entity2			1
the letter , whose signers include economists with ties to @entity19 , credited @entity20 for prescience in warning in 2005 about the impending mortgage meltdown , for her consensus style of leadership and for her commitment to job growth			2
outside chance : according to sources , @entity27 treasury secretary @entity36 is not interested in being the next head the @entity7 @entity216 critics of @entity2 had focused in particular on the role he played in deregulating parts of the financial industry during the @entity81 administration			1
more than 20 @entity113 senators this summer signed a letter to @entity19 expressing support for @entity20			0
the letter was circulated by senator @entity224 of @entity225 , a member of the @entity114			0
last week , another committee @entity227 , @entity228 of @entity229 , announced he would oppose @entity2			0
aides to @entity224 and to senator @entity231 of @entity232 , also on the committee , indicated that their bosses intended to oppose @entity2 , too			0
that meant @entity2 would have to win support from @entity237 on the committee , a tough challenge			0
still , a @entity45 nomination would likely face resistance from many @entity237			0
critics argue that the @entity7 's low - rate policies have raised the risk of high inflation and dangerous bubbles in assets like real estate and stocks			1
@entity20 is seen as a leading architect of those policies			0
@entity19 had vigorously defended @entity2 in recent weeks , both in public comments and in closed - door meetings with lawmakers			0
' i will always be grateful to @entity2 for his tireless work and service on behalf of his country , and i look forward to continuing to seek his guidance and counsel in the future , ' @entity19 said sunday .			0

former treasury secretary @entity2 has withdrawn his candidacy for @entity7 chairman
he made the decision after facing growing resistance from critics
the path is now relatively clear for vice chair @entity20 to become the first *female* chair of the @entity7
