@entity1 driving licences are to feature the @entity2 as well as the current @entity4 flag under plans announced today			1
ministers said the changes meant that @entity1 motorists will be able to ‘ fly the flag with pride ’ on the photo - card element of their licence			2
the @entity4 flag alone has been displayed on full driving licences since photocards first came into use in july 1998			1
but today transport minister @entity19 is announcing that anyone applying for a new licence or changing their personal details will be issued with a licence showing both the @entity1 and @entity4 flags			1
the changes will apply to motorists in @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 and provide road users ‘ with a symbolic sign of their national identity ’			0
transport minister @entity19 said : ‘ people in this country rightly take pride in our national flag which is why i am delighted it will now be displayed on @entity1 driving licences			1
transport minister @entity19 said the changes meant that @entity1 motorists will be able to ‘ fly the flag with pride ’ on the photo - card element of their licence ' @entity47 strengthens our sense of national identity and our unity			1
i will feel proud to carry my new licence and i hope others will too			0
’ @entity54 announced two years ago that he wanted to see the @entity1 flag on @entity1 photocard licences			2
but the final go - ahead was postponed until after the referendum on @entity29 independence			0
ministers feel that the driving licence is , alongside the passport , the single most widely used identity document in the @entity1 and that it is an anomaly that the card is dominated by an @entity4 flag			1
they are using an upgrade to the licences - which will now include a microchip - as an opportunity to change its design			0
an @entity4 directive passed in 2006 requires the @entity4 flag to be on the driving licence as part of the single market , but permits other symbols to be on the card			1
in 1996 , the @entity78 government was planning to put the union flag and the crest on the then - new plastic card driving licences that were shortly to be introduced			1
however , the @entity84 government that came in a year later reversed this decision , and the new plastic licences , first issued in 1998 , had no union flag or royal crest			2
one reason was that there was doubt that @entity93 drivers in @entity94 would tolerate the union flag on their driving licence – and it still seems that no symbol will be placed on cards issued in @entity94			2
ministers say the inclusion of union flags on licences is ‘ one of a number of improvements being made for motorists ’			0
on 25 october this year , the @entity107 announced a dramatic drop in licence fees for those who apply online			0
in the interests of reducing unnecessary red tape , since october 1 this year the paper tax disc is no more and motorists can pay their vehicle tax by direct debit			0
from june 8 next year the paper counterpart of the photocard licence will no longer be required			0
the @entity107 has also introduced a service to allow the public to check the most up to date information on their driving record .			0

@entity1 driving licences will soon feature the @entity2 as well as @entity4 flag
@entity4 flag alone has been on full driving licences since 1998
