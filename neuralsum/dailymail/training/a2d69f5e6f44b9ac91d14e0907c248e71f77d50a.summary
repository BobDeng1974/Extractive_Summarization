by @entity0 published : 01:49 est , 9 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:06 est , 9 december 2013 breakthrough : a new contact lens could release a steady flow of drugs to combat glaucoma a new contact lens which releases drugs slowly into the eye could be the next weapon to treat glaucoma , the world 's leading cause of irreversible blindness			1
the method has been proposed for 50 years to replace inefficient eyedrops but has been held up by technology , which left scientists unable to provide a steady dose over time			1
but @entity23 researchers say they have for the first time developed a lens which can deliver a regulated dose of latanoprost , a common glaucoma drug , for up to a month			1
the study by @entity30 and the @entity31 has been hailed as a key step forward in the fight against the disease , which affects 480,000 people in @entity36			1
glaucoma occurs when the drainage tubes within the eye become slightly blocked preventing eye fluid , aqueous humour , from draining properly			2
this builds up pressure which can damage the optic nerve			0
the condition can be treated with eye drops , laser treatment or surgery , but there is no perfect option			0
cornea specialist dr @entity51 said : ' in general , eye drops are an inefficient method of drug delivery that has notoriously poor patient adherence			0
' this contact lens design can potentially be used as a treatment for glaucoma and as a platform for other ocular drug delivery applications			1
' the lenses were designed by encasing a thin film containing the drug inside the edges of the absorbent plastic used to make contact lenses			0
glaucoma is the main cause of irreversible blindness and affects 480,000 people in @entity36 ( file photo ) tests found single contact lenses were able to achieve , for one month , latanoprost concentrations in the eye fluid that were comparable to those achieved with eyedrops			1
the treatment could be combined into contact lenses which patients already wear to correct their eyesight			0
professor @entity80 added : ' the lens we have developed is capable of delivering large amounts of drug at substantially constant rates over weeks to months			2
' the findings were published in the journal @entity88			0
dr @entity51 claimed they could help ' save millions from preventable blindness ' .			2

@entity93 has been proposed for 50 years but held up by technical *problems*
researchers in the @entity23 now say they have perfected a slow *-* release lens
technology can release steady flow of drugs for up to a month
@entity36 has 480,000 people with glaucoma , the main cause of blindness
