in a game lacking goals it proved to be an eventful 90 minutes for @entity3 - on and off the ball - in @entity5 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity7			1
as the game was petering out in second half stoppage time , the @entity9 striker was struck by a beer can thrown from the crowd prompting the @entity9 striker to immediately turn his attention to the spectators			1
incoming : standing near the @entity7 goal , a fan throws a beer can at @entity3 impact : the @entity5 striker reacts as he is struck by the beer can fury : @entity3 immediately engaged with the crowd following the incident caught on camera : tv cameras also caught the footage of the beer can being thrown at @entity30 offending object : the can which struck @entity30 lies by the side of the pitch @entity3 engaged in dialogue with those in attendance , with the area containing @entity5 and @entity7 supporters			1
it was n't the first time the @entity5 hitman was targeted in the game , as he was also the victim of cynical play from @entity7 ' @entity45 , who following a foul , directly kicked the ball into @entity3 's body while he lay on the ground following a trip			1
the incident led to @entity3 verbally confronting the @entity54 star , who was lucky to only be booked for the unsportsmanlike play			0
by this point the game had already been stopped due to an electrical storm , but @entity3 was also guilty of missing three excellent chances to score			0
taking one for the team : @entity45 kicks the ball straight at @entity3 's body following a stoppage in play below the belt : @entity3 was tripped for a foul seconds before @entity45 stuck the ball in retaliation angry reaction : @entity3 squared up to @entity45 following the incident the first resulted in him firing wide with just the keeper to beat , seconds before play was brought to a halt in the 23rd minute			2
the 24 - year - old missed two decent opportunities in the second half too , the first an ambitious chip from inside the box drifting wide , while the second saw the former @entity78 forward header over unmarked from a @entity80 cross			0
given the beer cans and nasty tactics thrown at @entity30 , boss @entity81 will be glad the striker he is likely to start against @entity85 in @entity5 's @entity87 opener did n't manage to get himself sent off			0
however he will hope that by the time the rumble in the jungle on june 14 comes round , @entity3 may have found his shooting boots			0
chance gone : @entity3 wastes a chance to score by heading over the crossbar from a @entity80 cross post reaction : @entity3 kicks the post following a missed opportunity a drink i do want : in the @entity101 heat , @entity3 takes a break to take on fluids along with @entity104 now get your shooting boots , @entity107 ! following the full - time whistle @entity3 walks off the pitch			2
