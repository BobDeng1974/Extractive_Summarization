the government 's ' business is @entity4 ' website looks like it 's for military recruitment , an mp has claimed women are being put off going into business - because websites encouraging female entrepreneurship use too many @entity11 flags , an mp has claimed			1
branding on the government 's ‘ great business ’ site is not seen as ‘ woman - friendly ’ and looks too much like a military recruitment site , a study by the @entity18 ’s @entity17 has claimed			1
mrs @entity17 , the government ’s women in business ambassador , singled out the website as a barrier for femail entrepreneurs considering setting up their own companies			1
she said there was too much ‘ untapped talent ’ in the country because of the lack of women in business			2
the @entity18 mp said too many women thought entrepreneurship services was ‘ not for them ’			1
the @entity36 mp said : ‘ one powerful way to show women that services are for them is to be explicit about it			0
‘ the www.greatbusiness.gov.uk website includes a page explicitly for women in enterprise , which is welcome			2
it has links of particular interest to women entrepreneurs			0
‘ to show graphically that the page is for women the bar on the right - hand side of the page uses all - women case studies			0
‘ however , in all other respects the page uses the same branding as the rest of the great business website			1
‘ this branding is seen as not “ woman - friendly ” : the proliferation of @entity11 flags , for example , has been compared to a military recruitment site			1
’ ms @entity17 proposes changes to the website and notes clicking on one link leads to the ‘ supposedly gender - neutral ’ finance page which has three case studies , all men			2
@entity18 mp @entity17 said @entity13 websites were not ' women friendly ' because they featured @entity69 she said : ‘ the unintended implicit message is that finance is a “ male ” subject			1
women should be treated as a high priority if the government aims to raise their participation in enterprise to approximately 50 per cent			0
‘ the link to the women 's section of the website should appear at the top of the homepage			0
currently it is near the bottom right - hand corner			0
‘ the women 's section of the great business website is welcome but the branding should be made more inclusive			1
’ it adds the website is a powerful tool but needs to ‘ speak to women in language they recognise ’			0
in the report 's conclusion , ms @entity17 said : ‘ women 's employment levels are now higher than at any other time since records began			2
‘ however , as long as just one business in five is owned by a woman there will be untapped talent which could be boosting the economy and creating jobs			0
‘ women 's entrepreneurship is a huge potential growth area which will benefit from increased government attention			0
