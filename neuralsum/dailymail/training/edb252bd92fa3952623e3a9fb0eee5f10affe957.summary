by @entity0 continental - style cafes selling wine by the glass , deli - foods and gourmet cheese are being opened in some @entity7 stores in new ‘ grazing areas ’			1
the chain already offers coffee shops in competition to the big chains , but it is now looking to take on bars and restaurants by offering meals to ‘ ladies who lunch ’			0
the first of the food outlets is at a new @entity7 in @entity21 , @entity22 , which took the building from the co-op earlier this year , while more are planned across the country			1
no longer just a supermarket : @entity7 is trailing continental - style cafes where customers can sample wines and food on sale in the store another opened last week in a new store near @entity35 , which is also trialling a fresh juice bar and a wine tasting area			1
the grazing areas , which include benches and tables , are provided next to the deli and bakery areas to allow customers to try upmarket , gourmet products that are on sale around the store			1
customers can choose from platters serving ham , cheese and artichokes , together with a glass of wine for £ 7.50			1
the move is part of a shift by the major supermarkets to transform big box stores into miniature high streets with a mix of other services in the hope of turning a shopping trip into an event rather than a chore			0
@entity7 has had huge success in increasing the number of people visiting stores with its daily offer of a free coffee or tea to holders of its @entity74 card , however it has upset some independent coffee shops			2
the chain also has plans to double the number of conventional in - store cafes , serving hot food from lasagne to ham hock pie , taking the figure up to around 200			0
it has also announced plans for 100 mini-gardening shops or pods outside stores this spring , selling grow your own vegetables as well as plants and other products			0
expanding : customers will be able to enjoy a glass of wine and food platter when they do their weekly shop @entity98 already offers deli - style restaurants serving wine in some outlets , while @entity102 has added @entity104 family restaurants , @entity105 + @entity107 coffee shops and @entity109 bakers to some ‘ extra ’ stores			1
@entity102 is also rumoured to be working on a high street takeaway food chain that would rival the likes of @entity113			0
@entity114 , the @entity7 nutrition manager , said there is a big change in eating habits and lifestyles , with people moving away from sitting down to breakfast , lunch and dinner towards snacking			0
looking ahead , she said : ‘ the idea of three square meals a day will give way to little - and - often grazing			0
‘ consumers will monitor their own calorie intake and energy use through technology and specially designed apps			0
with an ageing population , smaller portions of nutrient - rich foods will be popular			0
’ the new continental style grazing areas selling wine are a major departure for the store , which was found in @entity138 , west @entity139 , in 1904 by @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			1
the name @entity7 was adopted in 1908 after @entity142 left the business			0
growing : @entity7 already has around 200 conventional cafes selling hot drinks and food the chain was taken over by the @entity150 partnership in 1937 when it had just ten stores and it has now grown to more than 300 including more than 30 smalller convenience stores			2
wine tasting is offered at @entity21 , @entity22 , along with a food platter from the deli counter , which cost £ 5.95 each and include a selection of cheese , meats and bread			1
adding a glass of wine takes the price up to £ 7.50			1
@entity7 said the ‘ grazing area ’ concept is a trial and therefore the company is unable to say how many other outlets will introduce them			2
apart from grazing areas , it has also opened wine tasting areas at stores in @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174			2
stores offering wine tasting charge £ 3.25 a glass from the store ’s range , while @entity7 also allows customers to buy a bottle of wine at the normal retail price plus a corkage fee for drinking it on the premises of £ 7.40			1
the firm ’s managing director , @entity187 , is due to outline the next phase of the trials at the new @entity35 store next month			0
the company operates a wine and food bar in the food hall of @entity150 at the @entity198 shopping centre , however it is now planning to run similar outlets in @entity7 supermarkets for the first time .			2

new ' grazing areas ' let customers try gourmet foods on sale in the store
customers can order platters which come with a glass of wine for £ 7.50
@entity214 of the food outlets is at a new @entity7 in @entity21 , @entity22
