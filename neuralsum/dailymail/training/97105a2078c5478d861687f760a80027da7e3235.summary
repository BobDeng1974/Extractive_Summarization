mr @entity0 said the proposal was ' the start of the road ' for improving public health the @entity6 will this week issue a stark warning that the public can no longer expect the @entity9 to ‘ do everything ’ and people will have to take better care of themselves			1
shadow health secretary @entity0 will announce plans on thursday to get half the country active by 2025 - claiming it is the ' key ' to improving public health			1
mr @entity0 told @entity17 : ‘ in a century of rising demand , rising cost of health , it is the most cost - effective way we can give people the keys to their own health			1
' people will have to take more responsibility for their own health			2
’ he added : ‘ the @entity9 wo n’t be able to do everything			1
it ’s maybe a message that people have n’t heard from @entity6 always			1
‘ there ’s sometimes a sense that we can just do everything top - down to improve people ’s health – well that ’s clearly not the case in the @entity38			2
‘ we have to send out a tougher message to people about saying , look , if we are all going to live to our 90s we have to take care of ourselves , if we are going to get the most out of life as we get older			2
‘ we have to be honest and say the @entity9 wo n’t be able to do everything			1
' mr @entity0 is preparing to unveil a host of measures to improve public health - including better food labelling and legal limits on the amount of sugar in what children eat and drink			1
he said : ‘ think about mandatory food labelling – there has been too long a debate about this			0
we just need to get on with this			0
you need a chemistry degree to read a cereal packet			0
this ca n’t come a moment too soon			0
’ it comes after mr @entity0 last night revealed plans to ban super-sized bottles of cheap cider in a bid to tackle teenage drinking			1
the shadow health secretary wants to outlaw ' high - strength , ultra-low - priced white ciders ' sold in three litre bottles			1
mr @entity0 told @entity17 products like @entity74 , @entity71 and @entity72 were fuelling under - age binge drinking and alcohol addiction and needed to be tackled			2
the @entity6 frontbencher said the high - strength ciders were cheaper than they used to be – meaning children could ' cobble together ' enough money to get drunk all nights of the week			2
he said children as young as ' 11 or 12 ' were regularly boozing after school in a way their parents ' generation would not have been able to afford			2
mr @entity0 told @entity17 that rising demand for health services - as witnessed in the current @entity90 crisis - meant the most cost - effective way of keeping health costs under control was to get people active many ciders available at pocket money prices have an alcohol content of 7.5 per cent – well above the strength of mainstream cider products – costing as little as 20p a unit			1
he said the cost and strength of cider made it ' very attractive to under - age drinkers , and it is also a major drink of choice for addicts and street drinkers '			0
mr @entity0 said : ' these cider products are particularly used by children because of their low price and high strength			1
' we 've worked it out at 20p a unit			0
we 're talking about which can be up to 7.5 per cent in strength but are retailing at £ 1.99 or less – and this is a two or three litre bottle			0
' young people can cobble together the money to get hold of them			2
' what we are trying to signal [ is that ] coming in with a sledgehammer approach and just hitting everybody – that just loses people			0
they think why is everyone being punished – what 's fair about that ? ' he added that the proposal was ' the start of the road '			0
shadow health secretary @entity0 wants to outlaw ' high - strength , ultra-low - priced white ciders ' sold in three litre bottles but mr @entity0 all - but admitted he had gone boozing with his friends as a teenager			1
the former health secretary said : ' i think we all grow up , do n't we , and we learn as we go			1
' i was n't whiter than white in that respect			0
i did normal things that teenagers in the @entity145 do			0
' mr @entity0 pointed to a survey of white cider drinkers by @entity148 which found 50 per cent saying they drank more than three litres a day , and 42 per cent saying they had been drinking it for more than ten years			1
the shadow health minister is considering banning the sale of cider in bottles of more than one litre in size , or by taxing larger volume cider containers more heavily			1
the party is also looking at proposals to create a new cheap cider tax to increase the cost of cheap booze			1
a proposal to increase the minimum apple juice content that cider is required to contain will also be considered			0
this would increase the cost of producing white cider – forcing up the price in the supermarket			0
@entity6 said the ballooning cost of treating alcohol related illnesses meant tackling problem drinking was essential			2
the harmful use of alcohol costs the @entity9 in @entity178 around £ 3.5 billion a year and alcohol - related crime costs £ 11bn per year , the party said			0
one in five children who drink now consume 15 or more units per week – twice an adult woman 's weekly recommended limit			0
binge drinkers by 15 are four times more likely to be addicted in later life , and almost half of young people excluded from school in the @entity190 are regular drinkers .			0
