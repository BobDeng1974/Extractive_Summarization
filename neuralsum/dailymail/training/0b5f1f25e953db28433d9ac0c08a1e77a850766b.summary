it could be the ultimate diet - all the benefits of going to the gym , in a drink			2
@entity4 has revealed it is developing ' exercise in a bottle '			2
it hopes to create a drink or pill that burn fat in the same way that a workout does			1
@entity4 believe it can create a food that mimics the fat burning effect of going to the gym scientists at the @entity4 's @entity16 say they have identified how an enzyme in charge of regulating metabolism can be stimulated by a compound called @entity21			1
the researchers looked at how the master regulator of the body 's metabolism , an enzyme called @entity27 , is controlled at the molecular level			1
the world 's biggest food company , @entity4 is better known for @entity32 candy bars and @entity34 capsules , scientists at the firm 's @entity16 say they have identified how an enzyme in charge of regulating metabolism can be stimulated by a compound called @entity21			1
the findings were published in the science journal @entity41 , and are a potential first step in developing a way to mimic the fat - burning effect of exercise			0
the goal is to recreate the effect of exercise in a pill or drink			1
it will initially be aimed at people with limited mobility due to old age , diabetes or obesity , @entity57 , the scientist who oversees research on diabetes and circadian rhythms at @entity4 , said			1
his group of researchers looked at how the master regulator of the body 's metabolism , an enzyme called @entity27 , is controlled at the molecular level			1
' @entity27 is a key protein in every single cell in your body and is naturally activated by exercise			1
' it monitors your energy status , like a fuel gauge in a car , and tells you to fill up when your energy is low , ' professor @entity57 said			0
@entity27 's role is important as energy is needed for all the key physiological processes in the body , from secreting a hormone to moving a muscle and even brain function			2
the findings were published in the science journal @entity41 , and are a potential first step in developing a way to mimic the fat - burning effect of exercise			0
' our research has revealed new knowledge about this master switch			0
' in some conditions , such as diabetes , the body does n't respond properly to insulin and muscle cells reject the message about their need to take up glucose			1
' however , even under such medical conditions , @entity27 can find an alternative way and take up glucose in muscle , ' prof @entity57 said			0
' ideally , we 'll be able to develop products that will help promote and augment the effects of exercise			2
he cautioned , however , that no product would ever simply replace exercise			0
' exercise has so many different effects – a cognitive role and physiological function – we 'll never be able to mimic all those effects in a single product , ' he said			2
@entity118 , head of the @entity119 , said it was key to understand how to apply the basic knowledge			0
' the next stage is to identify natural substances that can influence this molecular mechanism			0
the goal is to recreate the effect of exercise in a pill or drink			2
it will initially be aimed at people with limited mobility due to old age , diabetes or obesity			1
' this could lead to the development of new dietary approaches with targeted effects on the body that , like exercise , could help in addressing metabolic problems and maintaining a healthy energy balance , ' he said			1
@entity144 , a professor of metabolic medicine at the @entity146 , told @entity147 points out others have tried to develop fat - burning products before , to no avail			0
' a successful attempt in producing metabolic - assisting foods that mimic exercise would be marvelous -- the holy grail , ' @entity144 said by telephone			0
' but there 's no such thing as a free lunch			0
so far no such product has ever passed clinical trials			0

will use *chemicals* to recreate the effects of a workout on the body
will be aimed at those with limited mobility due to age , diabetes or obesity
