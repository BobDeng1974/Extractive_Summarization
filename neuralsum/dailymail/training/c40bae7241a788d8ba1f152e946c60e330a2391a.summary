by @entity0 it 's the world 's most watched sporting event , with 100 million viewers tuning in each year for a glimpse of the colourfully garbed cheerleaders , the high octane half time entertainment , and , of course , the on - pitch action			1
but if the thought of @entity11 leaves you flummoxed - and let 's face it , it 's a complicated game - then @entity15 can help			1
we asked the game 's top players and leading commentators to explain why the @entity20 is worth staying up for			1
the prize : @entity22 of last year 's winner , the @entity24 , lifts the @entity20 trophy the game explained from the @entity28 perspective , @entity11 looks very much like a game of rugby , albeit with added padding			1
but that 's not so , says @entity33 , @entity34 presenter for @entity35			1
instead , he says , it 's all about possession which means risks , thrills and spills crop up far more often			0
' the ball changes hands far less frequently than in football or rugby , ' he reveals			2
' so teams like to protect the ball much more than they do in other sports , which means they take less risks			0
' glitz : the @entity20 - and the @entity34 - is famous for its cheerleaders such as the @entity51 's ladies our experts : @entity56 quarterback @entity55 and @entity34 aficionado and tv presenter , @entity57 for those who have absolutely no idea what it all means , he explains : ' the objective is drive the ball down the field as efficiently as you can until you score either a touchdown ( worth six points , plus a shot at an extra point “ conversion ” ) or a @entity71 ( a kick through the upright worth three points )			1
' @entity74 usually try for a field goal from around 50 yards or nearer - often they want to bank the points rather than risk coughing the ball back to the other side			0
' ' @entity11 is a really strategic game , ' adds @entity11 aficionado , tv presenter @entity57			1
' it ’s like chess , only with really , really big pieces			0
' meet the teams this year 's tussle pits the @entity85 against the @entity86 , with the @entity85 the favourite to win , largely thanks to efforts of their star quarterback , @entity89			2
but according to @entity55 , a quarterback playing for the @entity56 , @entity89 has competition in the shape of his teammate , @entity93			1
' one player who is flying a little bit under the radar is my old college mate @entity93 – running back for the @entity85 , ' says @entity55			1
star name : @entity100 's top quarterback @entity89 warms up ahead of his @entity20 debut ready for action : a crowd of @entity86 fans prepare to head to @entity106 for the big game hot dog expert and @entity110 food expert @entity108 explains how to make the perfect @entity20 snack			1
ingredients 8 thick knockwursts or hot dogs4 to 6 jalapeno pepers , sliced crosswise ( 32 slices ) 4 to @entity116 or @entity118 hot dog buns2 tablespoons melted @entity119 , ketchup , relish , and / or diced onions , for serving method for more @entity110 recipes , see @entity108 's website , barbecuebible.com ' if the weather is n’t great in @entity127 he will be called on a lot more and i will be looking out for him this weekend			0
' the pair will , however , have to overcome the @entity86 ' formidable defensive line if they want to take the trophy home and that means getting past the likes of @entity136 and @entity137 - both of whom came within a whisker of being named the @entity141			0
' you ’ve got the @entity86 defense , whose defensive backs call themselves the @entity146 , ' enthuses @entity147			0
any part of a team that has a nickname should be commended			0
they ’ve got great defensive players all over their team , and that ’s why they ’ve conceded so few points over the season – an average of just 14 points per game			1
' ' @entity20 happens just once every year and the two best teams in the world meet for the ultimate prize in [ @entity110 ] football , ' adds @entity55			1
' whatever happens it is going to be exciting			0
' how to @entity167 along with eating your own weight in nachos and watching the action , according to @entity147 , drinking games are a popular way to keep your spirits up while play continues			2
' there ’s been a lot of talk about [ @entity85 quarterback ] @entity89 ahead of the game , and about how one of the calls he makes at the line of scrimmage [ see @entity185 's explanation below ] is @entity186 , ' he explains			1
' if you go to @entity188 , there ’s a fantastic @entity186 drinking game			2
it ’s one way of entertaining yourself during the game			2
not that i ’m encouraging drinking during football , of course			0
but it ’s very funny ! ' @entity196 he might not have the glamour of last year 's halftime performer , @entity200 , but @entity201 certainly knows how to knock out a tune			2
one of the youngest performers ever to perform during the @entity20 , the 28 - year - old star will be joined on stage by veteran rockers , the @entity207			1
' @entity20 is just such an amazing spectacle , ' adds @entity55			1
' everything that goes into it , helps make it the biggest sporting event in the world			0
' from the half time shows to the tv adverts this is the game everyone wants to be involved in			1
' the @entity20 : @entity218 on sunday 2nd february from 10:30pm half time : @entity201 will become one of the youngest ever half time performers when he takes to the stage @entity222 : the @entity207 will join @entity223 this year - @entity200 wowed the crowds in 2013 @entity34 is a game of possession the ball changes hands far less frequently than football or rugby			1
so teams like to protect the ball much more than they do in other sports , which means they take less risks			0
broadcaster @entity234 compared the strategy found in the @entity34 to a game of chess and the surface level complexity of the game – each man has a very clear , mapped out set of objectives for each play – sometimes confuses the newbie fan			2
but although it ’s highly technical in some respects , it ’s ultra simple at the core			0
the objectives explained drive the ball down the field as efficiently as you can until you score either a touchdown ( worth six points , plus a shot at an extra point “ conversion ” ) or a @entity71 ( a kick through the upright worth three points ) which teams usually try from circa 50 yards or nearer , often if they want to bank the points rather than risk coughing the ball back to the other side			2
it 's all about possession the team with the ball ( the offense ) has four shots ( downs ) at advancing it a minimum of 10 yards and this is all run by its offensive general , the quarterback			0
if they make the 10 yards ( or more ) they get another four chances , and this keeps on going till they get the ball into the @entity278 ( for a touch down ) or decide to kick the @entity71 or if they give the ball back to the opposition , consciously or otherwise			0
here 's how things can go wrong ... if they feel that they ’re in danger of losing possession – they need too many yards to guarantee another set of downs , or its too far for a @entity71 attempt - then they ’ll punt ( kick , like an supersized up and under ) the ball back to the other side who promptly try and take the ball back up the field the other way to score			0
they can also lose possession by fumbling - losing control of the ball allowing the other team to gain it , or via an interception which is when the quarterback throws it and a defender catches it instead of the intended target			0
and do n't forget the opposing team ! oh , and while the @entity306 is trying to get lucky , the opposing team ’s @entity304 is trying to nail each and every one of them .			0
