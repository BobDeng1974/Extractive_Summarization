but this time they were the ones getting a rude awakening			1
police in @entity6 burst in to a series of homes in the early hours of yesterday morning to deliver final warnings or eviction notices			1
officers visited 22 homes in @entity22 to tell tenants - many dressed in pyjamas and dressing gowns - that they face being booted out if they do not mend their ways			1
all the tenants had racked up a shameful series of complaints from those living around them fed up by their noise , anti-social behaviour , music , loud arguments			1
after issuing a number of warnings , staff from @entity37 's @entity36 served 20 tenants with legal notices giving them one last chance to change before losing their homes			1
and two were handed eviction notices telling them court proceedings would soon be started to kick them out			1
the action was taken as part of a joint police and council initiative called @entity52			2
north tyneside council 's safer estates manager , @entity53 , said : ' @entity52 involves serving nuisance households with final warning notices			1
if the anti-social behaviour continues people risk being evicted			0
' crimes linked to the properties included drunk and disorderly , theft , criminal damage , breach of the peace , drug offences , threatening behaviour , intimidation , noise nuisance and shoplifting			0
one man who lives next door to a block where three households were served with notices said his neighbours were making life a misery for him			1
the pensioner said : ' it 's been a nightmare living next to them			1
there are parties and noise going on until about 3am in the morning , and people keep breaking the door in			0
' i 'm really glad something is being done			0
a mother was also given an eviction order because of her out - of - control son 's behaviour			2
the 12 - year - old had received repeated warning from police for terrorising a local vicar , jumping out in front of his car , and throwing fireworks			2
inspector @entity117 , of @entity118 , said it was essential that residents report anti-social behaviour to police so that his officers can take action			2
and he explained that eviction warnings were a better deterrent than arrests on some cases			0
' it 's particularly impactive that the other residents in the street that have to put up with the people see something being done , ' he said			2
' quite often these people are involved in low level crime but on a regular basis , and this can be more impactive on people 's everyday lives than a more serious crime that is a one off			0
' @entity118 is committed to addressing the issues that are affecting our communities , be it crime or anti-social behaviour related			0
