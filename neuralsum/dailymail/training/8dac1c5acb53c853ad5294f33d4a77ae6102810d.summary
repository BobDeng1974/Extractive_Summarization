it 's either the most detailed paint job ever or @entity1 are the most inattentive people in the world			1
a video of a model parading around the streets of @entity10 's @entity9 neighborhood completely naked - but her legs covered in paint that had been fashioned to look like jeans , complete with stitching and even on - trend patches - quickly went viral this week			1
the funny footage was part of a social experiment by @entity20 to determine just how observant the people of @entity1 are			1
the result ? not very			0
getting ready : model @entity23 is painted by a team of experts from @entity27 in preparation for a social experiment about @entity1 realistic : naked from the waist down , the model was given paint - on jeans that looked exceptionally real do n't give a damn : as the model ventured out on the streets of @entity1 , she was filmed from behind to gauge the reaction of the people who passed her just another passenger : even on a packed subway , no one noticed the model was not wearing pants bustling : even in @entity47 , no one gave a second look @entity49 : walking up and down the famous @entity47 steps also failed to turn heads lunch rush : customers at @entity53 were much more interested in burgers than @entity56 's behind the model , @entity23 , was expertly painted by body art company @entity27 , according to @entity59			1
the video , which garnered close to one million views in one day , shows her venturing on the subway , down the steps of @entity65 and even into @entity66 's for lunch			0
all the while , nobody seems to notice she is essentially naked			2
the best of the footage shows @entity56 strolling into popular women 's fashion chain @entity74 and asking a staff member where she can buy the same ' jeans '			2
the employee looks at her and the ' pants ' and tells her to ' check downstairs ' of the store			0
however @entity56 did not go completely unnoticed			0
while filling up her metrocard , a man comes up behind her and takes a photo of her , well , behind			0
she turns just in time to catch him and laughs raucously			0
topping up : @entity56 topped up her @entity91 ticket beside a family , who were none the wiser gotcha : one observant man - perhaps the only one - caught the model out , taking a picture of her derriere to prove it a very similar experiment took place earlier this year in a much more assuming part of the world - @entity104			1
a model walked around the city of @entity107 with painted - on blue jeans , only this model was wearing a g - string			1
the @entity112 model allowed her her pal , make - up artist @entity115 to paint on a pair of trustyeveryday denim and then she went outside for a stroll			2
paired with a bra and shirt tied at the waist , the model , also named @entity115 , walked the streets as usual			2
only her trip managed to cause quite a stir			0
that 's one way to get attention ! a @entity112 model walks down the streets of @entity107 with jeans painted on work of art : makeup artist @entity115 paints a pair of blue faded jeans onto a model the first shot of the model wearing a white g - string as @entity115 begins her makeove the idea was thought up by students @entity140 and @entity142 , who study @entity143 at a school in @entity145			1
their homework assignment was to create a ' @entity149 video ' for their final exam - that is , one that would generate a lot of views and publicity			0
and it seems they certainly fulfilled their brief			0
the pair recruited the make - up artist , who took two hours creating the faded blue jeans on @entity115 's legs using body paint			1
and she 's off ! the model walks out onto the street with her painted jeans and a shirt on and onto the streets of @entity107 in @entity104 to watch video in full please click here .			2
