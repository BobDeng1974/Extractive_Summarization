she could be imprisoned for 18 weeks @entity25 @entity26 heard @entity10 's deception was uncovered when the @entity23 were alerted to the horses by a member of the public			1
both horses - a seven - month - old black foal and a bay colt estimated to be about two years old - were severely emaciated			1
@entity10 today admitted two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to two horses and one count of breaching a disqualification order banning her from keeping the animals			1
a police officer says @entity18 has ' gone from rags to riches ' after being rescued @entity44 , chair of the bench , told @entity10 the offences fell into the most serious category , level three , and required a minimum 18 week prison sentence			1
' it comes into the third level and that 's because of the length of the neglect and the fact that these horses were hidden from the @entity23 and your previous sentence , ' ms @entity44 said			2
@entity10 was banned from keeping horses for five years and sentenced to a community order at @entity61 on october 1 last year			2
while that case was under investigation , @entity10 acquired further horses , including the bay colt and black foal , which is now in the care of ms @entity3			1
on december 3 , @entity23 inspector @entity68 was called to the @entity70 livery yard - where @entity10 was responsible for the full care of her horses - after the landlord raised concerns			2
prosecuting , @entity76 said ms @entity68 , who attended with a vet , found the horses stood in a yard with dirty water and an empty bucket by them			2
' the foal was so emaciated that the body condition score was 0.5 , not even one , where one is emaciated and five is obese			2
the colt had a body score of 1.5 , ' mr @entity76 said			0
the animals were immediately seized and vets began intensive treatment to save them - with the foal requiring antibiotic injections twice a day for a severe lung infection			2
' the period of suffering commenced within a very , very short space of time of the order actually being imposed by the court , ' mr @entity76 added			0
' it is the most obvious and flagrant disregard of a court order in a very short space of time			0
' mr @entity76 said the horses had little straw in their stables , which were strewn with faeces , and dirty water			0
in interview , @entity10 claimed she fed the horses a bale of hay every day from a local farmer but could not afford to give them more			0
@entity10 today admitted two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to two horses and one count of breaching a disqualification order banning her from keeping the animals ' when asked about the condition of the black foal on december 3 , she replied " probably a bit ribby " , ' mr @entity76 said			1
' that 's entirely understating it			0
' representing @entity10 , @entity131 said her client , who lives with her father and brother , had tried to re-home the horses after the court order			0
' she said she advertised , she asked around but could n't find homes for them , ' ms @entity131 said			0
' she was desperately frightened of the situation coming to light because she knew she was in deep trouble when it did			0
' speaking after the hearing , inspector @entity68 said the black foal had experienced a ' rags to riches ' story after being adopted by ms @entity3			1

' the vet discovered he had a severe lung infection and was riddled with worms			0
i do n't think he would have survived the week if we had n't got the veterinary care he needed			0
' luckily he pulled through and has gone from rags to riches as he 's been adopted by @entity4 gold medallist @entity3 who has named him @entity18			1
' the other horse , called @entity166 , has since recovered and looking for a new home			0
@entity10 , who was released on unconditional bail , will be sentenced at @entity61 on june 9 .			0
