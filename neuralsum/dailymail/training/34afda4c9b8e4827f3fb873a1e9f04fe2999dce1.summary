by @entity0 published : 07:16 est , 29 november 2013 @entity2 : 10:54 est , 29 november 2013 the magical process of a large and colourful butterfly emerging from its pupa has been captured by a @entity7 photographer			1
artist @entity8 , 52 , who lives in @entity9 in the north east corner of @entity7 , took a series of photographs of the step - by - step process at his home			1
after waiting patiently for five hours , the photographer captured the moment the two - tailed pasha butterfly emerged from its cocoon - from when its wings could just be seen peeping out of the chrysalis to when it finally became visible in all its glory			1
mr @entity8 said : ‘ after around two weeks the pupa was getting a darker colour as the wings and body of the butterfly shone through the transparent pupa - skin			1
‘ i knew that it was almost time for the butterfly to emerge			0
‘ you never can predict exactly when the process of emerging will start , so i had to wait the whole morning before it happened			2
’ the photographer had his camera set up and on standby and waited five hours for the creature to begin to emerge			0
mr @entity8 waited five hours for the butterfly to emerge and first noticed its head and legs appearing , which were followed by its soft and shriveled wings before its body emerged			1
he said it did not look very beautiful at first ‘ first the head and legs appeared and then the soft and still tiny wings and eventually the whole body emerged , ’ he said			0
‘ in the beginning the butterfly was n't looking very beautiful with his shrivelled wings			2
’ mr @entity8 said that for the first 10 minutes the insect tried to look for a good place to hold on to and decided to hang below the empty pupa skin			1
‘ then it started to pump blood into the wing veins			0
you can see the wings grow and grow bigger and the beautiful patterns become visible , ’ he said			0
‘ the whole process took a few hours and after that the butterfly had to wait until the wings were completely dry before it could fly away			1
" mr @entity8 said he first came across the ' insect ' when it was a caterpillar egg on @entity77 , which is commonly known as a strawberry tree because of its red edible fruits			1
he spotted the tiny yellow - coloured eggs on the top side of the leaves on the evergreen shrub			2
the artist took the egg home and put it in a plastic container so he could track its transformation			0
the photographer said he first came across the butterfly when it was a caterpillar egg on a strawberry tree and then looked after the egg and caterpillar so he could watch it emerge into the magnificent butterfly ‘ this species of caterpillar only feeds from this food plant			1
i had to change the leaves every two days , because the caterpillars prefer fresh leaves ’ , he said			0
after a few weeks and after four or five moults , the caterpillar was fully grown , mr @entity8 said			0
‘ approximately five centimetres long , it was ready to moult for the last time and change into a beautiful jade - green pupa			0
’ of course after the photography session i set the butterfly free so it could look for a partner and take care of offspring , ’ he said			2
after breaking free , the insect spent around 10 minutes looking for a good place to hold on to and decided to hang below the empty pupa skin			1
it started to pump blood into its wing veins , which meant its wings grew in size and the patterns on them became visible			0
it took a few hours for the butterfly 's new wings to completely dry so it could fly away			2

a @entity7 artist recorded the two - tailed pasha butterfly emerging from its pupa after waiting patiently for five hours
@entity8 took care of the insect at his home in @entity9 , @entity7 after spotting eggs on a strawberry tree
the process of breaking free from its clear cocoon to spreading its wings took the butterfly around 30 minutes
