a high school student who suffers from autism and @entity2 was given a varsity letter by his mother to celebrate that he had begun playing special needs basketball at his high school , and then shockingly told he had no right to wear that letter			1
@entity9 , who attends @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , wore the letter , which his mother purchased for him , on a jacket , until he was told to remove it and never wear it again at school			1
and not only did the school tell the young man he could not wear his letter , but they are now firmly standing behind their decision			2
when asked if that policy might change however , given the situation , he said ; ' we have considered it , and our decision was no. we decided that is not appropriate in our situation because it is not a varsity level competition			0
' wanting more answers , mrs. @entity46 turned to the district , who said there was no official rule about who could and cold not wear a varsity letter			1
as for how this all happened , mrs. @entity46 said ; ' another parent , from what i am told , was upset that my son was wearing his letter jacket			1
' @entity9 however is getting a lot of support in the aftermath on this decision however , and a @entity65 petition to change this rule already has close to 15,000 signatures			1
mrs. @entity46 ( above ) said ; ' another parent , from what i am told , was upset that my son was wearing his letter jacket			2

' before he got the letter he was one of the biggest cheerleaders in the school it was incredible , after he got the letter jacket it just sky rocketed him to another level , ' said @entity90			2
he then said of the situation ; ' we ca n’t be cookie cutter			0
we have all kinds of kids with all kinds of different needs and we need to be able to make our rules adjust to meet those needs			0
' he added ; ' it ’s a message to @entity9 that you can be a part of something anywhere you want to			0
' as for mrs. @entity46 , she is not just fighting for her adopted son @entity9 , but all the kids , saying ; ' it ’s not just my son			0
