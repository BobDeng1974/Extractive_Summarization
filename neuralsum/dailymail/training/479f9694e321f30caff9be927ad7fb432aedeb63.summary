an unusual comet that is unlike anything seen before by scientists is expected to become visible from @entity3 in the coming weeks			1
if you 've ever bitten into deep fried ice cream , you might have experienced a taste and texture that was out of this world - in more ways than one			0
that 's because , according to @entity4 , the structure of @entity42 - which @entity6 's @entity44 spacecraft is currently orbiting - resembles the popular dessert			0
in an experiment , they found that while the exterior of a comet is encased in a hard , outer crust , the interior would mostly be fluffy ice			2
the scientists said the crust is made of crystalline ice while the interior is colder and porous			2
organic molecules like those found on @entity42 are like a ' final layer of chocolate ' on top			0
most comets that come that close do not survive the trip , according to solar scientists who study images beamed back by @entity5			1
yet this comet managed to survive , said dr @entity67 , a solar scientist at the @entity69 in @entity70 however , he warned the close encounter with the sun may have taken its toll			1
he said : ' there 's a half - decent chance that ground observers might be able to detect it in the coming weeks			0
' but it 's also possible that events during its trip around the sun will cause it to die fairly fast			0
' scientists are now attempting to calculate the path the new comet			1
@entity5 was initally designed to study the internal structure of the sun and the huge explosions that send the solar wind racing across the solar system			1
however , it has also become a major source of comet discoveries as these giant balls of ice and rock light up as they encounter the intense streams of ionized gas that is thrown out by the sun. now @entity5 has discovered 2,875 comets			2
most belong to the @entity102 , which all broke off from a single giant comet many centuries ago			0
this latest comet , however , does not bear any resemblance to these other comets nor any other family known			2
such non-group comets only occur a few times a year			0
in a video released by @entity4 the comet can be seen appearing on febuary 19 and taking a huge curving path away from the sun. towards the end of the video , as the comet begins to develop a tail , a coronal mass ejection from the sun throws huge amonts of solar material into space .			1

scientists say the comet does not fit into any of the known comet families
it *grazed* past the sun at a distance of 2.2 million miles from the surface
few comets survive coming that close to the sun , making this one unusual
the comet was seen to develop a tail as solar material erupts from the sun
scientists say it may become visible from @entity3 as it continues its *journey*
