less than half an hour after the final whistle , @entity1 ’s assistant first team coach @entity0 was overseeing an impromptu training session on the playing surface at @entity5			1
‘ the players had two training sessions scheduled for saturday , but they were crying so much in the dressing room i ’ve decided to make a change , ’ revealed @entity1 manager @entity6			1
this is the reward for success , an extra hour or two with the kids at their homes in lead @entity15 before the make their way into the training centre to prepare for sunday ’s clash with @entity19			0
@entity20 fires @entity1 ahead early in the game against @entity22 @entity1 are programmed to win football matches and @entity6 is behind the software			1
he is football ’s equivalent of @entity27			0
the hardware is out on the pitch , with @entity20 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 in a four - way battle for the club ’s player of the year award			1
@entity20 is very much the spare man these days , passing over the man - marking duties to his central defensive partner @entity38			1
on friday , in this piercing victory over four - placed - but one - paced @entity22 team - they delivered towering performances for the leaders			1
@entity30 played a key role for @entity1 as they maintained their lead at the @entity20 , without a goal in the @entity48 in his previous 37 matches before monday ’s trip to the @entity46 , has now scored in two successive matches			1
this is a vintage @entity20 year			2
@entity30 has come on strong , the protective cloak in front of the back four			0
he snarls , he bites and he won the tackles that mattered against @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			0
then there is @entity31 , entering @entity61 ’ exclusive club by taking 142 touches on the ball and sending 103 passes into the path of his willing team - mates			1
he makes this team tick			0
@entity32 , who looked like a man playing with two left foots on his feet in the first half , dutifully scored his 13th goal in the league since his arrival from @entity76 in the second half			2
@entity31 was influential in the centre of midfield for @entity1 to put that into context it took @entity83 62 games in a @entity1 shirt to reach that number			1
@entity32 is a goal - muncher			2
everybody is buying in to the team ethic and there was only a smidgen of frustration when the subdued figure of @entity94 was substituted in the 82nd minute			0
so what has changed in the make - up of this team ? ‘ we are much better when we have the ball and although we were strong defensively last year , with good organisation , we lacked a bit of creativity , ’ admitted @entity6			2
‘ the challenge this season was to bring the creativity and dynamic without losing the defensive qualities			0
@entity32 was on the scoresheet again for @entity1 in another impressive display ‘ at the beginning of the season there was a bit of conflict between these ideas and we made defensive mistakes , like the three goals at @entity117			1
‘ now the team is happy to have the ball			2
we are a very good team			0
’ the only problem they have is the inevitable fixture congestion that will come with so much success , but @entity6 has yet to confront these issues			0
in time , he is sure to			0
he has accepted the @entity126 schedule , but there are further tests ahead with the @entity129 , a two - legged @entity130 semi-final against @entity132 and the @entity133 clashes with @entity134			2
‘ my players are human , but the point is that every match for us is fundamental , ’ added @entity6			0
@entity1 ’s manager was certainly pleased with this one , making a cut - throat gesture in @entity143 ’s direction a minute or so before @entity144 blew for time			1
when they play like this , they can finish off whatever team they want .			0

@entity1 beat @entity150 rivals @entity22 2 - 0 at @entity5
