by @entity0 for @entity1 the @entity2 has been accused of ‘ blatant sexism ’ after downgrading the role of a female high - flyer whose affair with its chief executive posed a conflict of interest			1
last week @entity1 revealed that headhunter @entity9 , the bank ’s ‘ @entity10 ’ , is in a relationship with married boss @entity13 , despite having a key role in appointing the directors and chairman supposed to hold him to account			1
the co-op admitted there was a ‘ potential ’ conflict of interest and said it would take steps to tackle it			1
last week @entity1 revealed that headhunter @entity9 , the bank ’s ‘ @entity10 ’ , is in a relationship with married boss @entity13 ( pictured above ) but the troubled bank ’s solution was to strip 44 - year - old @entity27 of any role in the appointment process for the board – a move condemned by @entity32 and @entity33 women ’s groups as ‘ discriminatory and unjust			1
’ @entity37 mp @entity36 said that the co-op had failed to uphold its own ethical standards			1
‘ the fact they have stripped her of responsibility and let him carry on is blatant sexism			0
we are entitled to expect more from a bank which holds itself up as “ ethical ”			0
’ she added that it was a chief executive ’s job to be aware of potential conflicts of interests ; so it was his duty to report the affair to his board , not hers			0
@entity56 of the @entity57 agreed , saying : ‘ it ’s discriminatory and unfair – it ’s always the woman who has to make the compromise			0
’ and @entity63 of campaigning group @entity65 added : ‘ this is a sorry tale and both parties were rather naive if they thought that their affair would n’t have negative consequences			0
‘ but quite why ms @entity9 should take the “ hit ” of having her job watered down while mr @entity13 can carry on unaffected does n’t , on the face of it , strike me as equitable			2
’ a spokesman for @entity2 said last night : ‘ @entity75 now has no role in the recruitment of the new chairman and future directors at the bank			2
affair : last week , we revealed that on a working friday , mr @entity13 , 55 , and miss @entity9 emerged from her west @entity84 home at 2.30pm and turned up at their office in the @entity33 at 3.30pm ‘ this decision is role - based , not gender - based , and there is no question of sexism			1
if the @entity10 had been a man and the ceo a woman , then it would have been the man whose job would have been slightly impacted			0
’ how @entity1 reported the news that the married co-op bank chief was having an affair despite its claims to the contrary , the @entity2 also felt the conflict of interest was serious enough to report it to the regulator , the @entity105			1
neither the @entity2 nor the @entity105 would comment on whether that step was taken before or after our report			0
last week , we revealed that on a working friday , £ 2.9 million - a - year mr @entity13 , 55 , and divorced mother - of - three miss @entity9 emerged from her west @entity84 home at 2.30pm and turned up at their office in the @entity33 at 3.30pm			2
the co-op ’s handling of the issue echoes a similar situation at insurance giant @entity115 in 2009 then its £ 1.8 million - a - year chief executive @entity116 had an affair with colleague @entity119 , who was married to the company ’s human resources chief			2
shortly before the affair emerged , only miss @entity119 resigned ‘ by mutual agreement and in order to avoid any apparent conflict ’ .			0
