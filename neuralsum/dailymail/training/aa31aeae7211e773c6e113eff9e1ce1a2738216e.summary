an @entity0 who was viciously lampooned as ' mr @entity2 ' by locals on @entity4 after taking over a much - loved @entity6 pub , has won a £ 9,000 libel damages payout			1
@entity9 , 68 , was hit with a torrent of ' offensive and salacious ' abuse on a @entity4 page set up by @entity13 - who had previously worked at @entity14 , in @entity15 , judge @entity8 told @entity17 's @entity16			1
the two men ' fell out very substantially ' over the running of the 18th century coaching inn , the court heard , and the page became a platform for mr @entity13 and others to vent their spurious allegations			1
former accountant @entity9 , pictured ( left ) here outside the @entity16 in @entity17 , was awarded libel damages over former @entity6 publican @entity13 's ' mr @entity2 ' slur it was originally intended to advertise the pub , but mr @entity13 , 49 , re-branded the page , ' @entity31 - how not to run a @entity6 pub '			1
the page had over 100 members , many of whom - along with mr @entity13 - posted a string of venomous comments about mr @entity9 and his management of the popular hostelry			1
judge @entity8 said mr @entity13 , now a barman at ' @entity41 ' pub , in @entity42 , @entity43 , who was battling with mr @entity9 for control of the page , constantly referred to him as ' toad of toad hall '			1
comments posted made ' serious allegations about his competence and sobriety ' and of ' sexual impropriety during a cricket tour of @entity54 '			0
all those accusations were groundless , the judge told the court			0
although mr @entity13 had now issued a full apology , at one point he had refused to back down from his comments , telling mr @entity9 in a letter , ' i continue to regard you as flatulent , foul and distasteful , but ultimately as hot air '			1
mr @entity13 's campaign lasted from may to november 2012 , when mr @entity9 secured a court order closing down the page			1
slur : mr @entity9 was likened to the character mr @entity2 in @entity71 , by @entity72 although he was not the only one to post comments , the judge ruled mr @entity13 ' responsible ' for the web page and held that the campaign of abuse was ' motivated by malice '			1
mr @entity9 , who once stood as a conservative parliamentary candidate , said of the most offensive slurs : ' i could hardly go anywhere in @entity15 without some of these matters being referred to			2
' he was ' born and bred ' in the @entity85 town , he said outside court , and had played for the local cricket team for over 50 years			0
his family has lived in the area for nearly 300 years			0
@entity13 had previously worked at @entity14 , in @entity15 in a series of postings , mr @entity9 was unjustly branded an ' inveterate liar ' , also facing claims of poor ' management skills ' , mistreatment of staff and of shutting the pub for several hours ' because he ca n't seem to pull a pint by himself ' , said judge @entity8			1
one incendiary comment in july 2012 read : ' it p * * * * s me off that people like this can get pubs and keep hold of them ' cos they have money ' , the court heard			0
another suggested that , while on a cricket tour , mr @entity9 had been ' chased around a hotel in @entity54 ' by a ' local pimp chasing payment for the whores @entity2 had failed to pay '			2
judge @entity8 said that accusation was groundless and based entirely on gossip			0
mr @entity9 said the ' fabrication ' was ' designed to do him damage ' and had been acutely embarrassing for him			2
' there were allegations , by implication , of sexual harassment , ' said @entity124 , who added : ' there were also allegations of consorting with pimps and prostitutes , and so on			0
' given the damage to mr @entity9 's reputation , and the ' serious libels ' involved , £ 9,000 compensation was appropriate , the judge ruled			2
that amount would have been doubled but for the apology proffered by mr @entity13 , said the judge , who added : ' this was a campaign which continued for some months and must have been motivated by malice			2
' mr @entity9 told the judge he had had no choice but to come to court to vindicate his good name			0
a spokesman for @entity145 said outside court : ' obviously , it is a source of some gratitude that the judge has accepted that the conduct of @entity13 was unacceptable and caused damage to @entity14			0
' it is a great shame that one of the several offers to settle without the need for this quite awful lengthy legal action was not accepted			0
' it is understood that no further action will be taken against anyone else who posted libelous statements on the @entity4 page , unless they are repeated .			0
