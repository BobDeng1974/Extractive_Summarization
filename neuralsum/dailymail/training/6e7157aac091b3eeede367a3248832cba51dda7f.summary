by @entity1 reporter published : 20:23 est , 14 march 2012 updated : 04:56 est , 15 march 2012 resignation : executive director @entity4 has quit @entity5 in a letter in the @entity7 , claiming it cares more about money than clients the scathing resignation letter that a @entity5 executive published this morning has become an internet sensation			1
either reviled by the perceived ' toxic and destructive ' behavior of investment bankers or the audacity of the veteran employee to lambast his firm in such a public fashion , the letter has spanned the web throughout the day			2
the letter was written by @entity4 , an executive director who has worked at the @entity23 - based investment bank for 12 years , and detailed what he felt was the company 's moral decline during his tenure			1
published in the op - ed pages of the @entity7 , the letter was bound to garner attention no matter what			1
the fact that he included specific grievances only helped to fan the flame of @entity37 - bashing			0
' i can honestly say that the environment now is as toxic and destructive as i have ever seen it , ' writes @entity4 , who headed the firm 's @entity42 equity derivatives business in @entity44 , the @entity45 and @entity46			1
' to put the problem in the simplest terms , the interests of the client continue to be side - lined in the way the firm operates and thinks about making money			0
' since the incendiary letter was published this morning , a number of alternative versions have gone public as well , showing a more cheeky side than anything else			0
one site published a revised version of mr @entity4 's letter , though this time it was written by @entity64 who decided to leave the @entity65			1
@entity64 strikes back : one internet hit was a satirical version of mr @entity4 's letter written from the point of view of @entity64 who had decided to leave the @entity65 because it had changed during his time there in mimicking mr @entity4 's points and questions about the evolution of @entity5 , a firm he claimed to have loved so much , the fictional mr @entity64 did the same about his once - feared @entity65			1
' for more than a decade i recruited and mentored candidates , some of whom were my secret children , through our gruelling interview process , ' the letter reads			0
' how did we get here ? the @entity65 changed the way it thought about leadership			2
leadership used to be about ideas , setting an example and killing your former mentor with a light sabre			0
today , if you make enough money you will be promoted into a position of influence , even if you have a disturbing lack of faith			0
' predictably , @entity97 ceo @entity96 , who mr @entity4 specifically named as a root cause for the firm 's supposed decline , put out a statement both to the press and to employees where he tried to discredit mr @entity4 's claims and calm nervous clients			2
the real @entity96 : comedian @entity107 ( right ) wrote a satirical letter mocking the one written by mr @entity96 ( left ) in response to the resignation letter mr @entity4 wrote for @entity112 ' needless to say , we were disappointed to read the assertions made by this individual that do not reflect our values , our culture and how the vast majority of people at @entity5 think about the firm and the work it does on behalf of our clients , ' mr @entity96 wrote			1
comedian @entity107 wrote his own version of mr @entity96 's letter , clearly siding with mr @entity4			1
' at @entity97 , we pride ourselves on our ability to scour the worldâ € ™ s universities and business schools for the finest sociopaths money will buy			0
once in our internship program , these youths are subjected to rigorous evaluations to root out even the slightest evidence of a soul , ' mr @entity107 wrote pretending to be mr @entity96			0
' but , as the case of mr. @entity4 shows , even the most time - tested system for detecting shreds of humanity can blow a gasket now and then			2
for that , we can only offer you our deepest apology and the reassurance that one good apple wonâ € ™ t spoil the whole bunch			0
' the letter , and the ensuing internet firestorm , obviously made it a bad public relations day for the bank , and their share price dropped 3.4 per cent as a result			0
' greedy ' : in the letter , @entity4 claims the money - obsessed attitude will be the downfall of the investment bank			1
