but a handful of strangers have gotten the treatment up close , receiving papal phone calls out of the blue after writing him or suffering some personal tragedy			0
so the @entity19 faithful are being warned : be ready , especially if the landline rings			0
@entity21 : pope @entity3 has been surprising @entity22 who write to them by personally calling them back the 76 - year - old @entity3 has a fondness for making calls the old - fashioned way , using land lines and placing the calls himself , often surprising recipients by simply announcing : ' it 's the pope			1
' after his election in march , @entity3 reportedly called his newspaper stand in @entity32 to cancel his daily delivery and his shoemaker to tell him not to bother with papal red leather loafers but to keep making his regular black orthotics			2
the receptionist at the @entity39 headquarters in @entity40 thought he got a crank call when @entity3 phoned two days after being chosen pope looking for the @entity39 superior			2

@entity22 in @entity45 *shocked* to answer the phone and hear : ' hi , it 's the @entity3 '
*listen* first , then talk , and if the conversation permits , ask the *soccer* - *mad* @entity3 about the recent *friendly* between @entity45 and @entity89 .
always ask how @entity91 is doing . ' it *'ll* make him happy , ' @entity63 noted . @entity3 frequently refers fondly to his *86* - year - old *retired* *predecessor* who is living on the other side of the @entity96 *gardens* .
avoid *touchy* *subjects* like @entity96 *policy* or *scandal* .
do n't ask for any *favours* .
