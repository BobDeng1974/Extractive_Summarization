the findings could help scientists shed light on the current decline in bee species across the globe that threatens the world ’s crop reliant on bees for pollination			1

an eastern carpenter bee is pictured @entity34 and @entity35 scientists teamed up to model a mass extinction in bee group @entity37 , or carpenter bees , at the end of the @entity40 and beginning of the @entity42 eras , known as the @entity43			1
previous studies have suggested a widespread extinction among flowering plants at the k - t boundary and it has long been assumed that the bees who depended upon those plants would have met the same fate			0
yet unlike the dinosaurs ' there is a relatively poor fossil record of bees ' making the confirmation of such an extinction difficult			2
using a technique called molecular phylogenetics , the scientists analysed the dna sequences of four ' tribes ' of 230 species of carpenter bees from every continent except @entity66 for insight into evolutionary relationships			1

it is thought that bees searched for nectar from ancient flowers , illustrated alongside @entity74 in the study published in journal @entity78 , they began to see patterns consistent with a mass extinction			2
combining fossil records with the dna analysis , the researchers could introduce time into the equation , learning not only how the bees are related but also how old they are			2
@entity87 , assistant professor of biological sciences at @entity89 , said : ' the data told us something major was happening in four different groups of bees at the same time			0
' and it happened to be the same time as the dinosaurs went extinct			0
' while much of professor @entity99 ’s work involved behavioural observation of bees native to the northeast of @entity103 , the research taps the computer - heavy bioinformatics side of her expertise ; assembling genomic data to explain similarities and differences among the various species over time			0

a bumble bee on white @entity123 is pictured marrying observations from the field with genomic data , she believes , paints a fuller picture of these bees ’ behaviours over time			0
she said : ' if you could tell their whole story , maybe people would care more about protecting them			0
' indeed , the findings of this study have important implications for today ’s concern about the loss in diversity of bees - a pivotal species for agriculture and biodiversity			0
' understanding extinctions and the effects of declines in the past can help us understand the pollinator decline and the global crisis in pollinators today			0
