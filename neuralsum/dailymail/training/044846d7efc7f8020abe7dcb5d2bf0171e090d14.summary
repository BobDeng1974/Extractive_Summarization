by @entity0 published : 10:29 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 13:25 est , 20 november 2013 cleaners working on an aircraft in eastern @entity3 have found 24 gold bars worth more than £ 620,000 hidden in a toilet compartment - the latest in a series of smuggling attempts uncovered at the country 's airports			1
the cleaners had boarded the @entity11 plane at @entity12 ( formerly @entity12 ) airport on tuesday after it had travelled from the eastern city of @entity15			1
it had earlier been flying on international routes that included the @entity17			2
the gold is secretly stashed in an aircraft toilet at its international point of departure , where it remains when the plane lands at an @entity3 city			2
because that particular aircraft is then used to continue on as a domestic flight , a new passenger picks up the gold on the domestic leg and leaves the plane when it lands , knowing that there will be no customs checks			0
@entity3 , which rivals @entity51 as the world 's biggest gold consumer , has seen a rise in smuggling after import duties were increased three times this year to try to dampen demand for the precious metal			0
just last month an aircraft cleaning crew found 280 gold bars worth £ 1.17 million inside a plane 's toilet after it flew from @entity65 to the @entity67 capital , @entity68			1
just last month officials seized £ 1.17million worth of gold from an aircraft that landed in @entity67 ( left )			1
the most recent discovery in @entity3 is worth around £ 700,00 ( right ) haul : officials seized 280 gold bars from a plane 's toilet in @entity67 custom officials and police were aware that the gold had been hidden on the jet , operated by discount airline @entity81 , and the smuggler panicked and left the bars in the toilet			1
earlier in the year , police in @entity67 said , there had been ' scores ' of discoveries of gold on planes after couriers had decided the smuggling operation might have been discovered			2
@entity93 was also the scene of drama last month when 32kg of gold bars were found hidden in the toilet of a plane that had started out in @entity65			1
and when yet more abandoned gold was found on a plane that had set out from @entity65 , landed in @entity101 then continued on to @entity102 , an @entity3 intelligence official explained how the system was being operated			2
' in the case of the @entity65 - @entity101 - @entity102 flight , a carrier boarded in @entity65 and mid-air concealed the gold in the toilet behind the closet			0
' the plan was for another passenger to board the flight in @entity101 , remove the gold mid-air and clear it at @entity102 without customs examination because by then it was a domestic sector			0
' these smugglers travel business class since the number of passengers is less and the toilet is mostly unusued			0
they get down at @entity101 , leaving the goods behind			0
' another passenger then books a business class @entity101 - @entity102 ticket and takes out the goods mid-air and clears it in the domestic sector without customs examination			0
