@entity0 , who is not yet two , has made a name for herself as @entity2 at beauty pageants across the @entity4			1
but since making headlines at the weekend , her mother @entity5 has found herself in the middle of a furious public backlash			1
now , ms @entity0 has hit back at her critics , many of whom described her as ' cruel ' to enter her daughter in dance competitions at such a young age , and says their claims are ' absolute nonsense '			1
ms @entity0 , from @entity36 in @entity37 , told the show that @entity21 loves to dance and her performance in pageants is innocent fun			1
' a lot of negativity has come with it , ' she said of the backlash , which has seen her receive hate mail from as far afield as the @entity47			2
' originally i just wanted to promote @entity21 as a performing child , as she loves to dance and it has turned into this big pageant argument			2
' she also dismissed allegations that having @entity21 perform in such a manner risks her becoming over-sexualised at a very young age			1
' i think its a load of nonsense if i 'm honest , ' she complained			2
' it makes no difference to her , if we put music on now she would get up and dance to it			0
when the @entity66 hit is played in the @entity31 studio the toddler looks more bemused than enamored wearing a black leotard and curled hairpiece , beauty queen @entity0 shakes her hips and blows kisses to the audience as part of her ' @entity75 ' routine her mother @entity76 ( middle ) , 32 , has previously said that @entity21 is a ' diva ' who runs to the stage when her name is called - and screams when she has to leave ' she 's not wearing a wig today because she did n't want it on			1
if she really does n't want the wig on i do n't make her wear it			0
pageant director @entity19 also stepped in to defend the young dancer , saying : ' they are competitions - in the same way you have dance and swimming competitions			1
' you have winners and you have runners up			0
we do n't have losers in pageants			2
it is a competition but it 's very healthy			2
' she continued : ' my daughter @entity97 was horrifically bullied , as are most of the boys and girls who take part in pageants			0
@entity5 claims that many babies dance to ' @entity75 ' and she did n't teach @entity21 any moves ' their self confidence has been battered and that 's what happened with my daughter			1
she decided to take part in pageants and it has literally saved her life			0
' however , despite both women insisting that dancing in competitions is what @entity21 loves , the toddler refused to dance when @entity75 was played in the studio			1
despite its risqué lyrics , ms @entity0 defended the choice of song			2
' if you look on @entity123 there are lots of babies dancing to that song , ' she argued			0
' and because of the little dance moves it 's easy for her to do			0
i did n't teach her the moves , i just put the video on the telly			0
' despite admitting her partner @entity134 , who works in the military , has concerns about @entity21 's performances , ms @entity0 told @entity30 that ' if he really thought it would do any harm she would n't do it			1
' ms @entity19 , who has signed @entity21 to her talent agency , ' @entity140 ' , also reassured viewers that fears of perverts turning up to watch the pageants are unfounded			1
her mother said : ' she loves the attention of being up on stage and she screams to get up there			0
she 's definitely a diva			0
i have to hold her back ' ' they are a ticket only event and only friends and family are allowed in the audience , ' she explained			0
despite her reluctance to dance in the studio , ms @entity0 insisted that @entity21 is a ' diva ' who runs to the stage when her name is called - and screams when she has to leave			1
' @entity21 's like a little @entity66 , a little madam really , ' she added			1
' she loves the attention of being up on stage and she screams to get up there			0
she 's definitely a diva			0
i have to hold her back			0
