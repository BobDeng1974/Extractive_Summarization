@entity1 's sleeveless dresses , bandeau tops and spaghetti straps all call for one thing - the dreaded strapless bra			1
it 's hard to find a woman who loves these creations			1
traditionally , they fall down ( quite literally ) in several areas			2
designed for practicality over prettiness , they 're usually uncomfortable and unflattering , often squeezing your breasts into any shape other than the silhouette you actually desire			2
as a @entity20 , i 've found that strapless bras offer very little support for anyone above a b cup , and as for giving you any kind of cleavage , forget it			2
then , of course , there 's the ' strapless shuffle ' , the annoying wriggle - scoop - tug move you have to perform at regular intervals to avoid a wardrobe malfunction when moving fast , hailing a taxi , or - heaven forbid - walking down the aisle			1
but finally it seems that the fashion industry has woken up to such criticisms and dreamt up a new generation of strapless styles			2
these high - tech bras promise not only to look good and feel comfortable , but to stay put on bigger boobs , create cleavage and even do away with the wriggle - scoop - tug for ever			0
with a strapless dress to get into for a family party , i tried some on for size			0
no frills , no nonsense : @entity50 @entity50 padded , underwired bra , £ 20 , @entity52 @entity53 says : a fairly basic white design that does the job without frills			1
the padded , seam - free underwired cups were nice and smooth and gave good support , but the bra did n't fit as snugly as some of the other styles			1
it seemed to separate my boobs rather than push them together , and the bottom of the underwiring dug into my ribs slightly			0
for £ 20 , it 's a decent bra , but not particularly special			1
2/5 @entity69 decent : @entity69 superboost satin black bra , £ 30 , gossard.com @entity53 says : this comes with little round pillows called ' launch pads ' to slot into the cups for extra oomph			1
they create a decent cleavage but took up so much space there was hardly any room left for my breasts , so the top gaped slightly and i felt a bit exposed			0
it 's not great for wearing with plunging styles unless you want to have someone 's eye out			1
on a positive note , it created a lovely smooth profile at the sides with no overspill , and looked sexy yet stylish			0
2/5 @entity98 - @entity97 best looking : @entity98 black bra with white lace , £ 12.99 , hm.com @entity53 says : by far the prettiest , this fitted snugly against my chest bone ( the sign of a good bra , an expert fitter once told me ) , gave a slight uplift thanks to inbuilt padding , and did n't gape at the top			1
it did dig in a bit at the side , which might make it uncomfortable over long periods , and there was a bit of underarm overspill , but for under £ 13 , you ca n't complain			1
3/5 classy : @entity121 @entity121 ultimate bra , £ 36 , wonderbra.eu @entity53 says : it uses ' patent - pending hand - shaped technology to give lift , support and the classic @entity121 cleavage you 're looking for '			1
the hand - shaped internal supports are made to feel like someone cupping your breasts			0
it gave me a classy , natural - looking cleavage with just the right amount of uplift			0
it felt incredibly tight at first , and there was a bit of overhang at the sides , but it did n't budge , even when i jumped up and down			0
4/5 best all rounder : @entity145 @entity145 - best all @entity146 memory foam bra , £ 22.50 , marks @entity148 @entity53 says : if there is a holy grail of strapless bras , this could be it			1
it has ' new non-slip wing technology - amazing memory foam moulds to your shape for the perfect fit '			1
made of the same stuff you get in fancy pillows and mattresses , the moulds were incredibly comfy			0
the sides were a rubbery - feel fabric , which gripped without digging in and stopped anything spilling over the top			0
i almost forgot i was wearing it			0
what 's more , it 's a decent price , too			1
my favourite by a mile			0
5/5 luxurious : @entity175 @entity176 @entity178 aubergine bra , £ 45 , myla.com @entity53 says : the priciest bra i tested , this is 94 per cent silk , and it certainly felt soft and luxurious			1
it stays in place thanks to boned sides and silicone bands at the back and sides , but would probably suit small to medium cup sizes best as there 's not much there to hold larger chests in place			2
it gave a flattering natural shape , was n't too tight and did n't gape			0
the only downside is the seams might show under tight tops			0
4/5 @entity199 least favourite : @entity199 nude lace bandeau , £ 39 , @entity202 @entity53 says : understated and nude , this is definitely one for those with smaller chests			1
a more traditional strapless style , it 's underwired with a non-slip , slightly sticky silicone band , but that 's about it			2
the simple lace offered very little in the way of support and it left my boobs looking slightly squished			2
it 's so sheer your nipples would be in danger of showing through your clothes - which is never a good look			2
my least favourite of the lot			0
1/5 @entity226 - best for everyday best for everyday : @entity226 moulded cup bra , £ 39 , @entity226 ( 020 7629 9161 ) @entity53 says : with plain black moulded underwired cups and soft sides that do n't dig in , this @entity231 bra is great for everyday use			1
there was slight overhang at the sides - perhaps the price you pay for comfort - but all - over padding gave me a nice shape and the cups sat smoothly against my chest , making it ideal for wearing with snug - fitting tops			0
silicone bands around the top and bottom helped it stay put when i raised my arms skywards			0
it comes with see - through detachable straps , but i reckon you 're better off without them			0
4/5 @entity256 dreaded overspill : @entity256 secret support cream bra , £ 25 , debenhams.com @entity53 says : seam - free with moulded foam cups would work well under close - fitting clothes			1
like many i tried , it has optional straps for extra support when wearing halterneck or cross-back style tops			0
the ' integrated secret support panels ' claim to provide support and ' create the perfect lift ' , but while it gave me a better shape than the average strapless bra , it did mean a bit of boob overspill at the top			2
it 's so tight around the ribcage it would definitely stay put while dancing - though breathing might be a challenge			2

@entity98 's £ 12.99 black bra with white lace is the best looking
at £ 39 , @entity226 's bra is *expensive* but you *'ll* wear it all the time
@entity145 's memory foam bra though is the best all rounder
