prior to the row , there had been speculation that @entity2 might lose his prime - time slot			0
independent publicist @entity112 said that the controversy was likely to get @entity2 noticed and may translate into higher ratings			0
' a lot of it comes from his being @entity36 , he 's seen the differences between the @entity1 and @entity36 , he 's passionate and authentic in taking this issue on , and it 's probably only going to help him attract more people to his show , ' mr @entity112 said			2
