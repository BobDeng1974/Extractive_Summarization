by @entity0 published : 15:15 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 17:00 est , 4 october 2013 tomorrow night ’s @entity2 movie , starring @entity3 , has been famously met by contention from the @entity6 brand itself			1
now , the film ’s costume designer , @entity7 , has described the challenges she faced while outfitting @entity10 as @entity11 and staging four @entity6 fashion shows without use of the @entity6 archives			1
according to @entity7 , ‘ it was quite an adventure because the company did n’t help us at all in any way , even with archives or anything , ’ she told @entity15			1
the film , airing on the @entity33 network , stars @entity10 as a rather convincing looking @entity11 battling grief and a well - documented drug addiction in the wake of her brother @entity37 ’s tragic 1997 murder			1
@entity7 was required to create an array of accurately @entity25 - inspired costumes to provide viewers with a proper look at the brand ’s evolution			1
she had to devise an expansive wardrobe for @entity10 ’s character as well			2
from @entity11 ’s beloved stilettos , tight tops , and second - skin flared trousers , to the label ’s many runway missteps and triumphs , @entity7 essentially recreated the @entity25 story from thin air , only using @entity56 finds and reference photos as help along the way , she says			1
‘ we had to buy books and look on the @entity62 and try to find enough documents to base ourselves upon , ’ @entity7 said of @entity2 of @entity25 's costuming process			1
‘ i wanted to be as correct and close to the original as possible			2
’ unauthorized : @entity25 says that a new @entity33 movie about @entity25 ( pictured above ) should be considered ' a work of fiction ' but while @entity7 ’s efforts are admirable , the film ’s wardrobe shows how there is no true replacement for atelier seamstresses and creative genius			1
with the exception of @entity10 ’s wardrobe , @entity2 of @entity25 ’s costuming offers a cheaper , watered down version of @entity25 ’s glamorous luster -- the brand ’s true defining factor			2
a recreation of the colorful vinyl dresses worn by @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , and @entity88 in @entity25 's famous 1994 ad campaign fall flat in a scene recounting the shoot 's party atmosphere			2
its costumes in no way embody the same sexed - up space age brilliance as those created under @entity37 ’s inimitable watch			2
' @entity3 is thin , but not as thin as @entity11			1
we had four different corsets for her depending on the clothes she was wearing ' there are also , unfortunately , many failed attempts at recreating @entity25 ’s signature gold damask print , as @entity7 was forced to find a copy due to the brand ’s uninvolvement in the film			1
( @entity7 says ‘ they were expecting a bigger budget and a bigger star ’ ) @entity7 says that she worked on the film ’s costumes for ‘ twenty hours a day , seven days a week , for two months			1
’ she cut most of the costumes ’ patterns and fabric herself ( ‘ of course we did n’t have the staff of the @entity6 house ’ , she said ) , and enlisted the help of four seamstresses to execute the wardrobe ’s remaining technical labor			0
@entity10 underwent 43 costume changes in the film , most of which required her to wear a corset in the vein of @entity11 herself			1
‘ as [ @entity11 ] got older she was even wearing corsets under pants and tops , ’ @entity7 said			1
‘ @entity3 is thin , but not as thin as @entity11			1
we had four different corsets for her depending on the clothes she was wearing			0
’ task at hand : @entity138 recreated four @entity6 fashion shows in the film with the help of four seamstresses @entity10 ’s performance , laden with a soft interpretation of @entity11 ’s heavy @entity145 accent , shows the iconic designer in the irate throws of cocaine addition , taking stealth helpings of the substance from a gilded keychain			1
her drug - induced angst , a byproduct of her brother @entity37 ’s murder , tarnishes her business and personal relationships , which only recover after a stint in rehab			0
it ’s @entity10 ’s physical appearance that makes her on - screen role so convincing			0
@entity11 ’s signature glossy look is well articulated through expert hair , makeup , and styling			1
recreating @entity11 ’s protruding pout was accomplished with a tiny cotton ball placed under @entity10 ’s lip			1
' we did n’t want to show how much @entity11 has worked on her face and how distorted she is now ' ‘ i ’m pretty sure that @entity3 looks a lot better than the actual @entity11 , ’ @entity7 told us			1
‘ we did n’t want to show how much @entity11 has worked on her face and how distorted she is now			1
we still wanted to appeal to the crowd , and did n’t want to make her look disgusting or disfigure her			2
’ on thursday , the @entity6 brand issued a statement in anticipation of the film ’s release			0
‘ @entity25 has neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever in the forthcoming tv movie about mrs @entity25 , ’ reads a statement issued to @entity15			0
the @entity2 of @entity6 film ( which begins in 1996 and culminates around 2005 ) is based on the 2010 book ‘ @entity184 ’ by @entity183			0
the @entity6 brand says that ‘ since @entity25 did not authorize the book on which [ the film ] is based , the movie should only be seen as a work of fiction			0
" representatives for the @entity33 network refrained from offering a counter statement when reached by phone on thursday evening			0
house of @entity25 ’s backstory is very much rooted in facts			0
@entity25 has even confirmed her cocaine addiction and stint in rehab in a 2005 interview with @entity201			0
all in the look : @entity10 wore a tiny cotton ball under her lip to make her pout protrude like @entity25 in that vein , @entity10 does portray the public ’s well - engrained perception of @entity25 ’s platinum personality			1
it ’s a singular stereotype that was first widely broadcast in the early aughts with @entity213 ’s well - loved @entity212 on @entity214			0
@entity11 herself has called @entity217 ’s impersonations ‘ hilarious ’ , an interesting counterpoint to her brand ’s opinion of @entity2 of @entity25			1
but the two portrayals are not so different in their levels of contentious content			0
a 2003 @entity214 skit titled ‘ @entity225 ’ shows @entity217 ’s @entity11 handing out @entity226 and cigarettes to trick - or - treaters			1
her performance is weighted with the same cocaine , alcohol , and rage also found in @entity10 ’s more serious imitation			0
but the film falters at the hand of some historical inaccuracies			0
most are courtesy of the script ’s story - telling omissions			0
the film painstakingly details the @entity6 brand 's many financial woes that erupted after @entity243 ’s death , pointing to @entity11 ’s continuous strain of unrealized designs and excessive spending habits as the culprits			1
in doing so , the film makes it seem like @entity25 was a completely undesirable commercial entity for nearly a decade ’s time			0
backstage : the film shows @entity255 's @entity11 take over the family business after the murder of her brother @entity11 is shown presenting her first collection after @entity37 ’s death , one which received grave reviews			1
what follows is a mélange of @entity11 ’s drunken , cocaine - fueled rants and missteps			1
the audience only sees the negative falls of @entity11 ’s @entity269 life , until she returns from rehab and presents the label ’s fall 2005 collection , which drew positive criticism			2
' @entity11 ’s many cartoonish media portrayals have not hindered her , or the @entity6 brand , in their present state ' while the @entity6 brand did take a design nosedive following @entity37 ’s death , it was by no means the drawn - out atrocity that the film describes			2
a @entity282 review written in 2000 calls @entity11 ’s @entity25 shows ‘ the social event of the season in @entity285			2
’ her designs , while no longer the catnip of style savants and supermodels , still made noise on the red carpet ( @entity288 ’s plunging @entity287 moment comes to mind )			0
the brand was not a critical success , but was still very desirable in the public mind			0
it 's worth noting that @entity11 ’s many cartoonish media portrayals have not hindered her , or the @entity6 brand , in their present state			2
@entity2 of @entity25 ends around 2005 , a time at which @entity25 found a reinvigorated foothold in the fashion industry			0
the brand has since continued to suffer from financial difficulties , and was even rumored for partial buy - out in 2012 , but has flourished in the critical and cachet arenas			0
in 2009 , @entity11 hired then - emerging @entity308 visionary @entity307 to restart the house ’s @entity310 diffusion line , as well as consult on the main @entity6 brand ( @entity307 departed last year in order to focus on his own label when it received a major investment from @entity316 )			2
new leaf : in the last five years @entity25 has expanded the @entity6 label 's purview by relaunching @entity310 , as well as bringing @entity320 ( pictured above ) @entity307 , as expected , brought some much - needed added edge to @entity25 ’s sexy , often too - sleek signatures			0
following his departure , fellow @entity308 upstart @entity325 took on the temporary reigns at @entity310 , the responsibilities of which will now be handed to a new designer each season ( @entity331 and singer @entity332 are rumored for the house ’s next choices )			2
the house ’s most recent accolade is a feature in @entity338 and @entity340 ’s song titled ‘ @entity6 ’ , which bluntly mention ’s the brand ’s name approximately 150 times in its lyrics			0
the track has become a meme amongst millennials , effectively skyrocketing the label ’s profile into a new , highly - desirable genre			0
@entity15 even recently spotted ‘ @entity25 ’ repeatedly graffitied onto construction walls in @entity355 ’s typically more @entity354 - inclined @entity353 neighborhood			0
as @entity2 of @entity25 points out , it may have taken @entity11 a bumpy ride to restore @entity25 to the glory days of @entity37 ’s influence			2
but it seems that now , more than ever , she is certainly on her way .			0

costume designer @entity7 says that she ' did *n't* want to show how much @entity11 has worked on her face and how distorted she is now '
star @entity3 placed a cotton ball under her lip to make her pout protrude like @entity11
