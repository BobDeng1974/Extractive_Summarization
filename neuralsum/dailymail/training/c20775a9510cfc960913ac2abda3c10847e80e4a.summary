@entity0 and @entity1 face off in a mammoth match between the @entity4 champions and title favourites this weekend			1
given the @entity8 ’ perfect start , this is already a must - win for holders @entity0 if they ’re to reclaim ground lost by defeat by @entity13 and a draw at @entity15			1
but @entity17 ’s side – inspired by @entity18 – are in rampant domestic form and it promises to be a scintillating showdown			2
here , @entity21 plays judge and jury as we return our @entity26 verdict on those in the dock this sunday … @entity31 , with three @entity4 goals already this season , will be a threat for @entity0 @entity18 's blistering start to life in @entity36 football has propelled @entity1 to the top of the table @entity0 @entity39 – comes into the game buoyed by his heroics in @entity43 , albeit them ultimately being in vain			1
still arguably the best goalkeeper in the league , although the man at the opposite end of the park on sunday could soon be challenging him for that title			2
@entity21 rating : @entity53 @entity39 was beaten by a late winner against @entity55 but had a very good match @entity57 – back in the side after missing @entity43 and his energy and endeavour down that right flank will make a huge difference			2
best right - back in the division			0
rating : @entity53 @entity57 is a rock at the back for @entity0 @entity66 – it says something for the improved form of the much - maligned @entity70 that new £ 32m signing @entity71 is n’t getting a look in			2
less conspicuous with shorter hair			0
rating : @entity75 @entity66 ( right ) is one of @entity0 's most improved players @entity77 – if @entity39 and @entity57 are up there with the best in the league in their position , the captain is up there among the best in the world			1
the ultimate leader of a defence and , indeed , team			0
@entity77 versus @entity18 could be one hell of a battle			0
rating : 9/10 skipper @entity77 is the rock at the heart of the champions ' defence @entity96 – likely to return to starting @entity97 and he ’ll have a point to prove having last started in the 1 - 0 home defeat by @entity13			1
could have @entity100 to contend with if the @entity101 pulls right			0
rating : 7/10 @entity0 left - back @entity103 prepares to swing a cross in @entity105 – will do for @entity0 what @entity106 does for @entity1 , anchoring the midfield with minimum fuss but maximum effect			1
rating : @entity53 @entity105 goes about his work with the minimum of fuss - but maximum efficiency @entity116 – a big game for the midfielder given the criticism he received in the wake of his casual performance against @entity55			0
former city star @entity122 called him a ‘ liability ’ last season and was shot down – perhaps the @entity125 had a point after all			0
rating : 8/10 powerhouse midfielder @entity116 disappointed against @entity55 video we must support @entity116 - @entity131 @entity132 – enjoying a decent run of form and will provide the graft rather than the craft in @entity0 ’s attacking midfield			1
rating : 7/10 @entity132 's hard graft will be a crucial asset against @entity1 @entity141 – the main man for @entity0 right now , his cunning will be crucial in unpicking @entity1 ’s backline			1
rating : 9/10 @entity141 - the main man for @entity0 in the early stages of the season @entity148 – did n’t enjoy his best night against @entity55 but remains a player capable of making the difference on an occasion such as this			1
rating : @entity154 @entity148 is another player with a point to prove after a poor performance in @entity43 @entity31 – only a substitute in @entity43 , he will return to lead the line and , with three goals from four in the league , @entity1 will have to be on their guard against the fit - again forward			1
rating : @entity53 @entity31 is expected to lead the line for @entity0 @entity1 @entity164 – has made an impressive start to life in the @entity4 but wo n’t be happy with six conceded in the last three			1
rating : 8/10 @entity164 had had an impressive start to @entity1 - but has only kept one clean sheet @entity171 – arguably @entity1 ’s best player this season – @entity18 apart			1
he will thrive in the high - stakes environment of sunday			0
rating : @entity53 @entity171 ( right ) has been his usual dependable self for @entity1 so far this season @entity176 – did n’t enjoy a great night against @entity177 but has matured into a top centre back for club and country in recent seasons			2
@entity31 could prove a handful , though			0
rating : 8/10 @entity176 , getting up close and personal with @entity185 's @entity184 , has matured into a top defender @entity187 – like @entity176 , will want to bounce back from @entity177 disappointment and he ’ll rise to this occasion			0
still one of best at his trade despite advancing years			0
rating : 8/10 @entity187 is still going strong despite his advancing years @entity193 – will keep new boy @entity194 out of the side and the @entity196 remains one of @entity17 ’s favourites for his reliability			2
rating : 7/10 @entity193 's dependability is keeping new boy @entity194 out of the team @entity106 – continues to grow in influence and stature and is just about one of the first names on the team - sheet			0
he ’ll be responsible for patrolling the domain populated by the likes of @entity141 and @entity148			0
rating : @entity53 @entity106 has become a key player for @entity1 since re-signing in january ramires – still to rediscover top form of a couple of seasons back but his energy will be key on sunday in a game that is sure to be decided in the midfield			2
rating : @entity154 the energy of @entity224 will be a key component of sunday 's crunch clash @entity227 – what a reintroduction to the @entity4			1
the @entity196 having been sensational this season			0
but this is his first big test and a lot is expected			0
rating : @entity53 @entity227 scored his first goal for @entity1 against @entity177 in midweek @entity234 – has played his way into @entity17 ’s xi but is yet to finish a game this season			1
the @entity125 needs to return more goals if he ’s to keep his place in the side			0
rating : 7/10 @entity234 needs to add more goals to his game to keep his place in the @entity1 team @entity100 – another season of improvement is expected and the early evidence suggests the @entity101 could again take his game to another level			2
rating : 9/10 @entity100 has had a strong start to the season and is @entity1 's man with the magic feet @entity18 – the @entity4 ’s best player so far this season with seven goals from four matches			1
there may be question marks over his fitness but the @entity196 would still score goals on one leg ! rating : @entity266 @entity18 celebrating has become a familiar site for @entity1 fans already verdict : @entity0 88 @entity1 88.5 – what does that tell you ? there ’s almost nothing to separate the title contenders and our trial by numbers only has @entity1 marginally in front			1
but it is , of course , the small margins which make the difference in these mammoth games .			0

@entity0 and @entity1 meet at the @entity285 on sunday in a huge clash between the @entity4 title favourites
@entity1 won both league meetings between the teams last season - 2 - 1 at home and 1 - 0 away
but @entity0 went on to win the title
@entity21 played judge and jury as we run the rule over the two teams as we return our @entity26 verdict
will @entity131 's champions or @entity17 's league leaders come out on top ?
