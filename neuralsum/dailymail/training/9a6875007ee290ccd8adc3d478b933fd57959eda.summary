' these people ( the @entity11 ) are the ones who invented the whole process of violence , of decapitations , of hanging people from bridges			0
' if , despite all that , you see one of their most violent leaders arrested , it means that even despite those methods , they 're being brought to justice			0
' @entity166 : the bodies of decapitated men with their hands tied behind their back are scattered through a field in @entity172 , @entity173 in 2007 , after the massacre of 27 farmers by the @entity11 shocking : innocent women and children and babies have been killed in @entity4 's brutal drug wars shoot - out : gang members lie dead in the grounds of the @entity183 , @entity4 , where at least six gunmen were shot dead after a gun fight between @entity4 military and armed men from the @entity11 he added that unless a clear replacement leader emerges for the cartel , that police would be able to handle groups on a local level			1
