by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:39 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 07:37 est , 1 september 2012 @entity2 won @entity5 ’s first @entity4 gold on the track last night in a stunning display that saw her smash the @entity4 record			1
the 20 - year - old wheelchair racer – nicknamed ‘ @entity10 ’ – and one of the ‘ faces ’ of @entity13 stormed to the @entity14 to the delight and roars of 80,000 packed in the @entity17 for the opening day of athletics			1
a strong pre-race favourite , @entity2 , who has a condition similar to cerebral palsy , led from the front on a dry , warm night to easily win her first @entity4 medal in a time of 18.06 seconds			1
jubilant : @entity2 celebrates her record - breaking victory in the @entity28 100m wheels on fire : @entity2 , front left , on track to victory during the women 's 100m at the @entity17 her win came on a mixed day for @entity35 that saw cyclist @entity36 win gold in the @entity39 but @entity38 , a seven times @entity4 champion and favourite for another cycling gold , was controversially disqualified			1
@entity43 , @entity44 , and @entity45 won silvers in the cycling while @entity49 bronze took a bronze in the @entity39			2
' @entity10 ' : wheelchair sprinter @entity2 will also compete in the 200m at the @entity52 while in the pool there were five silvers for @entity56 , whose brother @entity57 took bronze , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
in the stadium there was a bronze for @entity66 in the shotput			2
@entity2 ’s appearance had been one of the most anticipated of the @entity52 with many tipping her to be the track star of the @entity4			1
from her teens , when her father , an engineer , built a training “ roller ” for her racing chair in the basement of the family home in @entity77 , she has had to contend with being described as @entity5 ’s ‘ new @entity81 ’ – the record - breaking 11 time @entity4 champion			1
@entity2 suffered two heart attacks due to an infection she contracted when in the womb			1
as a result of this , her brain was starved of oxygen – leaving part of her brain damaged and affected her back , legs , hips and part of her hands , which means she has problems with fine motor skills , mobility and balance			2
her mother @entity100 , 49 , who watched her daughter ’s first gold last night , said : ‘ it ’s very much like cerebral palsy but @entity10 does n’t get the stiffness			1
she ’s able to get about but not very far			2
’ she said her daughter took a little longer to start walking than other children her age , and ‘ was in her buggy a lot longer than normal children would be ’			2
when @entity10 started school , her mother @entity100 said the disability did n’t particularly affect her			2
she added : ‘ she looked differently and she walked differently and there were limitations in @entity116			2
‘ but it did n’t hold her back			0
it did n’t affect her schooling – it was more the little sort of things – she ca n’t tie her shoelaces for instance			0
there were frustrations , because she could n’t walk far she could n’t always go into town with her friends			0
’ winning smile : @entity2 , pictured at the age of five , has a condition similar to cerebral palsy defying the odds : @entity10 is already a multiple world record holder - despite doctors saying she would never be able to do anything with her life when she was born at the age of 13 , @entity2 began playing wheelchair basketball and was spotted at the national schools event by @entity139 ’s husband @entity138 who gave her a go in the champion ’s wheelchair			1
‘ she immediately got hooked on speed , ’ her mother , a teaching assistant , said			0
‘ after seeing how much she loved it her father and the community came together to raise the funds to buy her a sprinting chair			0
it was n’t long before she was picked up by @entity153			0
‘ she was originally pencilled in to take part in the @entity156 games but she did so well at the @entity157 that she was brought forward for @entity158			0
’ mrs @entity2 travelled to the stadium last night with her husband , @entity161 , 50 , an engineer , and two brothers @entity164 , 23 and @entity165 , 16			1
@entity166 has been rewarded with big audiences for its £ 6million investment in the @entity4			0
the opening ceremony on wednesday drew more viewers than any of its other programmes over the past ten years			0
this is the highest for a @entity52 event in recent history - although some way from the top figures in excess of 12 million the @entity176 was achieving for the main @entity180			1
and around 3million tuned in to watch @entity5 in the wheelchair basketball between 9 and 10pm on thursday			1
other events have had encouraging audiences , with daytime peaks of around 1.8million			0
many viewers said they had been put off by the style of the coverage , which has been criticised as too sombre , with not enough live action and too many ad breaks			0
viewers were particularly furious when the live coverage of @entity194 ’s gold medal - winning performance in the pool was not shown because it clashed with the start of the news at 7pm			1
however , the network , which is broadcasting more than 400 hours of coverage and 150 hours in peak time , has been praised by the @entity201 for its commitment to the @entity4			0
a spokesman said @entity205 coverage , which is being run by @entity206 , was disappointing by comparison because there was very little coverage and nothing broadcast live			0
‘ @entity5 is leading the way , as is the rest of @entity213 , ’ he added .			0
