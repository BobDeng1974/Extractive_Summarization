@entity11 : the ipo will make @entity2 the richest pop star in the world			2
but the move to place @entity3 on the stock market has has evoked almost as many shivers of fear in the business world as it has gasps of excitement today , as @entity3 launched on the @entity31 stock exchange with a valuation of $ 104billion , it made more than 1,000 new millionaires - and investors such as @entity2 even richer			1

although his investment company has seen their @entity3 shares soar in value , the luck of the @entity13 deserted @entity2 when the group injected cash into smartphone manufacturer @entity86 in 2007			1
@entity11 invested $ 480m in the firm , only to see @entity70 ’s @entity89 take the market by storm and bring @entity86 to its knees			1
they did get their money back , however , when @entity95 snapped up @entity86 on the cheap , as @entity11 had ring - fenced their investment with a clause that guaranteed reimbursement if it was sold			2
@entity100 bolthole : a coastal property @entity2 owns in @entity102 , @entity103 , along with other homes in @entity56 and @entity105 @entity2 ’s investments then got tangled in the sticky web of the @entity10 @entity109 musical , which was panned by the critics and plagued by a series of accidents			1
it is understood @entity48 invested $ 65million in it , which some might say was sheer folly			1
though in the long run , now that the show is up and running smoothly , it could well be a money spinner			0

the building , which is also home to @entity159 , is soselect that its management committee once blackballed @entity161 to move in			0
having said that , those who have visited describe @entity163 , with its avant - garde stone walls and floors , as'charmless and stark '			0
despite its huge sun terrace with stunning views of @entity171 , one visitor commented : ' it has absolutely no warmth			0
' meanwhile , on top of his own lavish property in the @entity178 district of @entity132 - which he shares with his wife @entity181 and four children			0
