the speech by former @entity2 vice-president @entity1 was apocalyptic			1
‘ the north polar ice cap is falling off a cliff , ’ he said			1
‘ it could be completely gone in summer in as little as seven years			2
’ those comments came in 2007 as mr @entity1 accepted the @entity7 for his campaigning on climate change			2
but seven years after his warning , @entity10 can reveal that , far from vanishing , the @entity14 ice cap has expanded for the second year in succession – with a surge , depending on how you measure it , of between 43 and 63 per cent since 2012			1
the most widely used measurements of @entity14 ice extent are the daily satellite readings issued by the @entity30 , which is co-funded by @entity31			1
these reveal that – while the long - term trend still shows a decline – last monday , august 25 , the area of the @entity14 with at least 15 per cent ice cover was 5.62 million square kilometres			1
this was the highest level recorded on that date since 2006 ( see graph , right ) , and represents an increase of 1.71 million square kilometres over the past two years – an impressive 43 per cent			0
other figures from the @entity44 suggest that the growth has been even more dramatic			0
using a different measure , the area with at least 30 per cent ice cover , these reveal a 63 per cent rise – from 2.7 million to 4.4 million square kilometres			2
the satellite images published here are taken from a further authoritative source , the @entity56 ’s @entity55 project			1
they show that as well as becoming more extensive , the ice has grown more concentrated , with the purple areas – denoting regions where the ice pack is most dense – increasing markedly			1
crucially , the ice is also thicker , and therefore more resilient to future melting			0
professor @entity64 , of @entity66 and @entity67 , @entity68 , an expert in climate satellite monitoring , said yesterday : ‘ it is clear from the measurements we have collected that the @entity14 sea ice has experienced a significant recovery in thickness over the past year			1
‘ it seems that an unusually cool summer in 2013 allowed more ice to survive through to last winter			0
this means that the @entity14 sea ice pack is thicker and stronger than usual , and this should be taken into account when making predictions of its future extent			1
’ the speech by former @entity2 vice-president @entity1 ( above ) was apocalyptic			1
he said that the north polar ice cap is falling off a cliff and could be gone in seven years yet for years , many have been claiming that the @entity14 is in an ‘ irrevocable death spiral ’ , with imminent ice - free summers bound to trigger further disasters			1
these include gigantic releases of methane into the atmosphere from frozen @entity14 deposits , and accelerated global warming caused by the fact that heat from the sun will no longer be reflected back by the ice into space			1
@entity105 , professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at @entity107 in @entity108 , said last night : ‘ the @entity14 sea ice spiral of death seems to have reversed			1
’ those who just a few years ago were warning of ice - free summers by 2014 included @entity2 secretary of state @entity113 , who made the same bogus prediction in 2009 , while mr @entity1 has repeated it numerous times – notably in a speech to world leaders at the @entity119 climate conference in @entity120 in 2009 , in an effort to persuade them to agree a new emissions treaty			1
mr @entity1 – whose office yesterday failed to respond to a request for comment – insisted then : ‘ there is a 75 per cent chance that the entire polar ice cap during some of the summer months could be completely ice - free within five to seven years			1
’ misleading as such forecasts are , some people continue to make them			0
only last month , while giving evidence to a @entity138 inquiry on the @entity14 , @entity135 ’s professor @entity134 claimed that although the @entity14 is not ice - free this year , it will be by september 2015			1
asked about this yesterday , he said : ‘ i still think that it is very likely that by mid-september 2015 , the ice area will be less than one million square kilometres – the official designation of ice - free , implying only a fringe of floes around the coastlines			1
that is where the trend is taking us			0
’ for that prediction to come true it would require by far the fastest loss of ice in history			0
it would also fly in the face of a report last year by the @entity119 @entity157 ( @entity157 ) , which stated with ‘ medium confidence ’ that ice levels would ‘ likely ’ fall below one million square kilometres by 2050			2
politicians such as @entity1 have often insisted that climate science is ‘ settled ’ and have accused those who question their forecasts of being climate change ‘ deniers ’			2
however , while few scientists doubt that carbon - dioxide emissions cause global warming , and that this has caused @entity14 ice to decline , there remains much uncertainty about the speed of melting and how much of it is due to human activity			1
but outside the scientific community , the more pessimistic views have attracted most attention			0
for example , prof @entity134 ’s forecasts have been cited widely by newspapers and the @entity181			0
an area twice the size of @entity24 was open water two years ago and is now covered in ice after the arctic ice cap has expanded for the second year in a row yesterday dr @entity190 , who leads an @entity14 ice research team at @entity192 , said : ‘ @entity134 ’s views are quite extreme compared to the views of many other climate scientists , and also compared to what the @entity157 report says			1
’ dr @entity190 warned against reading too much into ice increase over the past two years on the grounds that 2012 was an ‘ extreme low ’ , triggered by freak weather			2
‘ i ’m uncomfortable with the idea of people saying the ice has bounced back , ’ he said			0
however , dr @entity190 added that the decline seen in recent years was not caused only by global warming			0
it was , he said , intensified by ‘ natural variability ’ – shifts in factors such as the temperature of the oceans			0
this , he said , has happened before , such as in the 1920s and 1930s , when ‘ there was likely some sea ice retreat ’			0
dr @entity190 said : ‘ there is undoubtedly some natural variability on top of the long - term downwards trend caused by the overall warming			0
this variability has probably contributed somewhat to the post- 2000 steep declining trend , although the human - caused component still dominates			0
’ like many scientists , dr @entity190 said these natural processes may be cyclical			0
if and when they go into reverse , they will cool , not warm , the @entity14 , in which case , he said , ‘ a decade with no declining trend ’ in ice cover would be ‘ entirely plausible ’			1
peer - reviewed research suggests that at least until 2005 , natural variability was responsible for half the ice decline			2
but exactly how big its influence is remains an open question – and as both @entity241 and @entity242 agreed , establishing this is critical to making predictions about the @entity14 ’s future			1
prof @entity105 said : ‘ i suspect that the portion of the decline in the sea ice attributable to natural variability could be even larger than half			0
‘ i think the natural variability component of @entity14 sea ice extent is in the process of bottoming out , with a reversal to start within the next decade			2
and when it does , the reversal period could last for several decades			0
’ this led her to believe that the @entity157 forecast , like @entity1 ’s , was too pessimistic			2
‘ ice - free in 2050 is a possible scenario , but i do n’t think it is a likely scenario , ’ she concluded			2
the apparent recovery in @entity14 ice looks like good news for polar bears			1
if there is more ice at the end of the summer , they can hunt seals more easily			0
yet even when the ice reached a low point in 2012 , there was no scientific evidence that bear numbers were declining , with their estimated total of 20,000 to 25,000 thought to be higher than in the 1970s , when hunting was first banned			0
in many @entity14 regions , say scientists , they are in robust health and breeding successfully			2
computer model predictions of decline caused by ice melt have also failed to come true			0
in 2004 , researchers claimed @entity284 bear numbers would fall from 900 to fewer than 700 by 2011			0
in fact , they have risen to over 1,000			0
however , the main international bear science body , the @entity287 , admits it has no reliable data from almost half of the @entity14 , so can not say whether numbers are falling or rising .			2

seven years after former @entity2 vice-president @entity1 ***'s*** warning , @entity14 ice cap has expanded for second year in row
an area twice the size of @entity299 ***'s*** biggest state - was open water two years ago and is now covered in ice
these satellite images taken from @entity56 ***'s*** @entity55 project show ice has become more concentrated
