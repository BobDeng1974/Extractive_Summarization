climbdown : @entity1 's @entity0 has now said the workers ' conditions are in ' complete contradiction ' to their ethical policy the @entity1 has for the first time conceded it is ‘ very concerned ’ that women in @entity8 making its ‘ this is what a @entity11 ’ t - shirts are paid just 62p an hour			1
the left - wing feminist organisation has for weeks rejected accusations of an ethical blunder after @entity16 revealed the conditions under which the workers are employed			1
but the @entity1 has now sent an inquiry team to the island to investigate			2
@entity21 chairwoman @entity0 made the climbdown yesterday , saying : ‘ obviously we ’re very concerned about what ’s been brought to our attention			0
it ’s in complete contradiction to our own ethical policy			0
’ ms @entity0 said that clothing retailer whistles , which sold the £ 45 t - shirts – worn by @entity32 ’s @entity31 and @entity33 , and @entity35 leader @entity34 – was conducting the investigation with @entity37 , a charity dedicated to ethical standards in fashion			1
‘ whistles are concerned and the government of @entity8 is concerned			2
what matters to us now is that there is a full and thorough investigation			0
we expect to have a report from them in about two weeks			0
’ but the news came after the charity was again accused of ‘ shameless hypocrisy ’ over its new campaign for a ‘ living wage ’ in the @entity53 , despite the fact the migrant workers in @entity8 are paid far below the official ‘ living wage ’ there , and were living 16 to a room in dormitories			2
yet when @entity16 asked the @entity1 whether it supported the living wage in @entity8 – which would represent a significant pay rise for workers producing their t - shirts at the @entity64 ( @entity65 ) factory – we received no comment			1
the official @entity8 living wage is £ 1.47 an hour , though the workers making the t - shirts do receive free board and lodging , however basic			1
labour leader @entity33 in the t - shirt , left , and right , how @entity16 reported workers ' plight whistles and the @entity1 chose to ignore the living wage – an official @entity8 government benchmark of a basic salary in the country – and instead pointed out the women were being paid above the minimum wage , a figure even the government accepted needs to be reviewed			1
in a press release last week , the @entity1 gave its full backing to the concept of a living wage , at least in the @entity53			2
commenting on figures showing the disparity between wages paid to men and women had closed only a little in the past year , it said more needed to be done to reduce the gender pay gap , and called on the government to sign up to the living wage in this country by paying it to civil servants and encouraging local authorities to do the same			0
@entity21 ’s deputy chief executive dr @entity100 said : ‘ we urgently need to tackle the unacceptably low wages paid to women			0
‘ @entity76 should take the lead in supporting the take - up of the living wage			0
’ @entity106 , a @entity8 union leader , last night condemned the @entity1 over its @entity53 living wage comments , saying : ‘ it seems to think it is ok to exploit workers in @entity8 , but not in the @entity53			1
it is guilty of shameful hypocrisy			0

@entity1 has finally conceded it is ' very concerned ' about working conditions in @entity8 factory
workers making ' this is what a feminist looks like ' paid just 62p an hour
