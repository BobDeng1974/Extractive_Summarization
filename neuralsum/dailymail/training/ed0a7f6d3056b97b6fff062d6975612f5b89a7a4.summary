' @entity0 is not a @entity2 player			1
' that much has been the perceived wisdom across the length and breadth of this country over the last 12 months			0
on the evidence of some truly wretched performances , nobody , in truth , can argue with that			0
in the next couple of weeks , it is likely that @entity0 will exit stage left from the @entity16 and the curtain will come down on a traumatic year for the bushy - haired @entity18			1
sadly , though , this last performance became a dark pantomime and a cruel exhibit of the heartless nature of football supporters			0
on a night of mostly uninspiring football , it may only have been boredom			0
maybe they thought it was funny			0
in truth , nobody really expected to see him again in the colours of @entity2			1
there may not be another occasion , despite tuesday evening 's rather eccentric impact			2
as @entity16 's east stand emphatically mocked every @entity0 touch and tackle , the turf of this famous old stadium must have felt a lonely , old place			1
it was all very unnecessary and demonstrated the unease that lingers around this club despite the sacking of @entity54			0
it seems peculiar for supporters to turn against one of their own			0
many @entity2 fans will argue that @entity0 is not one of theirs , instead part of the @entity63 enclave that arrived en - masse last summer			1
that is a little unfair , despite the limitations that were so visibly exposed last year			0
the satirical fanzine @entity68 produced a back page in april with @entity0 mocked up as a toilet brush			2
it read : ' flush a fortune down the pan with a @entity0 bog brush '			2
the nickname has stuck and on this august evening , the jeering was merciless			0
@entity77 selected to lead @entity30 ' revival group love : despite his struggles to win over the fans @entity0 appears to be popular amongst his team - mates on the ball : @entity0 ( centre ) came on for the last 14 minutes in tuesday 's friendly at @entity16 a sledgehammer has been taken to @entity0 's reputation but he remains an effective player and he would be a fine signing for most @entity90 sides			1
to his credit , he kept asking for the ball , kept challenging for headers and did not shirk the challenge			0
the goal was a little bit slapstick , @entity0 nudging the goalkeeper and defender out of the way and as the pair tumbled over , he slotted the ball into the empty goal			2
the celebrations were loud and long from the @entity2 players , with @entity105 , his @entity18 compatriot racing over to jump on to his back			1
@entity108 's players clearly did not approve of @entity0 's treatment , taking it as a collective affront			1
with what may be transpire to be his last touch for this club , @entity0 had scored his very first goal in the very last minute			1
that , at least , is very much the sign of a @entity2 player			2
sadly , it may all be too late			0
last hurrah ? @entity0 looks likely to be leaving @entity2 before the transfer window shuts			1

@entity0 scored @entity2 's winner in their 2 - 1 *victory* against @entity38 on tuesday night
@entity18 **midfielder** had a disappointing debut *season* at @entity2 last term
@entity0 's performances have been to the derision of @entity16 supporters
**midfielder** looks likely to leave @entity16 before the transfer window shuts
