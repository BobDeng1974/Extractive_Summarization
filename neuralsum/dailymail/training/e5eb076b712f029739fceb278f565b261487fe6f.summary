@entity0 has been hailed as a potentially exceptional driver of the future if he continues on his upward path in @entity4			1
that is the verdict of @entity7 ' head of vehicle performance @entity8 in the wake of the @entity12 's recent performances			1
in scoring the first podiums of his @entity4 career in the last two races - third in @entity17 and second at @entity19 became the first @entity7 driver to claim back - to - back top - three finishes since @entity22 in 2005			1
two in a row : @entity0 celebrates grabbing his second podium in a row at @entity19 in good company : @entity0 ( left ) celebrates his second place at @entity19 along with @entity29 designer director @entity28 , race winner @entity30 and third placed @entity31 you have to go back a further two years and to @entity33 for a run of three or more successive podiums , a feat @entity0 could achieve in this weekend 's @entity38 @entity37 at @entity39			1
regardless of whether @entity0 manages such a feat , @entity8 can not help but be impressed with what he has seen so far from the 24 - year - old			1
' he 's a great driver , someone who could become an exceptional driver , so we 're lucky to have him			2
' his racecraft is phenomenal , he 's super-quick , but the good thing about @entity0 is he 's a young lad with his feet absolutely on the ground			2
he 's not spoiled in any way shape or form , which is great			0
' he 's also able to accept advice very readily , not only about the very basics , but also about his racecraft and how he communicates with us			0
' at @entity19 , the communication between him and the pit wall - the messages we sent him and those that came back - were exceptional			1
' that 's what you need , to have that level of synergy between driver and pit wall , that cohesion between what we 're all trying to achieve so that it 's all going in the right direction			0
carving through : @entity0 made his way through the field to grab second at @entity19 as he leads the way in front of @entity77 's @entity76 and @entity79 's @entity78 all a blur : @entity0 has now grabbed successive podiums in @entity4 , the first for a @entity7 driver in nine years ' at @entity19 it came off as well as it could do , to be honest			1
you could n't really have hoped for anything more than that			0
my opinion is growing of him week - by - week			0
' with 33 points from the last two races , @entity0 has rocketed up to fifth in the drivers ' @entity95 the constructors ' , @entity7 are up to fourth , just three points behind third - placed @entity79 , yet @entity8 is eager to put the brakes on any rising expectations			1
' it would be quite remiss for me to say @entity7 has the second fastest car and it will remain like that ' added @entity8			2
all smiles : @entity105 , @entity8 , has lavished praise on @entity0 on the right track : @entity0 drives on the start / finish straight during the @entity110 @entity37 at @entity19 it 's so tight in the midfield it can swing either way and you can go from having the second fastest car to the fifth fastest very easily			2
' you need to keep the pressure on in every single area , that 's how you end up with a car able to win races , and eventually comfortably win races			0
' you have to keep your feet on the ground and be respectful of your competitors and respectful of every single circuit you go to , and we absolutely are			0
' that 's my philosophy , the philosophy of ( chief technical officer ) @entity129 , and it 's a philosophy i pass on to the team			0

@entity0 became first @entity7 drive since @entity22 in 2005 to claim back - to - back podiums
@entity12 targeting third successive podium at @entity38 grand prix - a feat last achieved at @entity7 by @entity33 11 years *ago*
the 24 - year - old now fifth in drivers ' *standings* following 33 points in last two races
@entity7 ' head of vehicle performance @entity8 believes @entity0 can become exceptional and @entity148 outfit are lucky to have him
