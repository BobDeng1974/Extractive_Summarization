mr @entity1 stands to admire the stunning green landscape at @entity160 in @entity65 , @entity3 mr @entity1 's goal is to raise $ 14,500 on his current expedition so that two underprivileged teenagers can attend sea kayaking camp in @entity3 in 2015 ( a bald eagle above ) ' if their lives exist on the screen now , it â€™s unrealistic to think they will have the desire to connect with the natural world as they mature			1
