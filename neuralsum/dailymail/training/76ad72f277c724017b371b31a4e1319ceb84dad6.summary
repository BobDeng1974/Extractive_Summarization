the job advert reads : ' the tutor should constantly be researching and planning a culturally rich range of musical and dramatic performance , visits to art galleries and museums , restaurants , sites of historical or contemporary interest — any place or activity that the tutor thinks will be an essential part of this " life – curriculum " in its most encompassing sense			1
