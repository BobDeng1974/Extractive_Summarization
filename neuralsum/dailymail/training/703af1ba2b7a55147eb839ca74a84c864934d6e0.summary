by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 after their @entity4 title challenge faded away at the back of last season , @entity2 have started the summer in exactly the right fashion			1
the signing of @entity9 from @entity10 in a £ 30million deal was confirmed on thursday ; the second highest transfer in the club 's history , the @entity16 's arrival has provided fans with genuine belief that they can prolong their stay at the top of the table this season , while adding to the many attacking options at @entity25 's disposal			1
but how will the team shape up ? video : scroll down to see the @entity2 players , including @entity9 , in the new @entity30 kit a @entity32 deal : here 's how £ 30million signing @entity9 will look in the new @entity2 kit signal of intent : the @entity16 has the potential to play in all the front areas ; he can be whatever he wants to be reason to cheer ? @entity25 could revel in a first title win in 10 years challengers : how @entity2 could line up next season ' players win games , squads win titles , ' is a quote often banded about when talking of @entity4 glory , and a way in which the @entity51 have fallen short in recent years			1
too often key players have picked up injuries at crucial times of the season , too often there has n't been enough adequate cover in the squad			0
take last season , when @entity25 had to call upon the inexperienced @entity60 in pivotal games due to @entity64 's form and fitness worries			1
but after convincing @entity9 to join , @entity25 has a wealth of attacking options available			1
the 25 - year - old has proved himself in many positions during some impressive displays for @entity10 and @entity71			1
he has the potential to partner @entity64 ( who will realistically start due to the physical nature in @entity74 ) or supply him from the left and right			2
couple that with @entity79 's imminent return from knee injury , and the @entity82 striker can no longer complain of being isolated up front			2
and if that does n't sound exciting enough , it should also see @entity86 drastically improve			2
the @entity88 playmaker was the star of the last transfer window - signing for £ 42.5m - but struggled to adapt to @entity74 football , not helped by the lack of pace to supply			2
now the @entity51 could simply blow teams away with pace and style			0
' playing the @entity2 way , ' as @entity25 would put it			1
the boss has been patient for so long , and has been rewarded with the money to go out and attract the world 's best			0
set to shine : £ 42.5m man @entity86 will benefit from having runners in @entity9 and @entity79 happy again : @entity86 has shown what he is capable of at the @entity102 with @entity103 confident : @entity79 's encouraging run of form was cut short by injury last season , but he 's recovering now injury free : @entity109 will be keen to shine once again this season see you soon : @entity111 will be a £ 10m replacement for @entity113 at right - back @entity2 's new - found solidity last season ( taking away the demolitions at @entity118 , @entity119 and the @entity120 ) had the look of a title - winning system , though surprisingly the team were let down by goals			1
it 's safe to say that should not happen this year ... @entity111 will be confirmed as @entity113 's £ 10m replacement , giving @entity25 a proven right - back capable of stepping up to the first team immediately			1
@entity130 was often the scapegoat in poor away performances , and @entity2 are looking to strengthen that midfield area			1
@entity134 and the @entity136 brothers have been linked but @entity137 would be a more - than adequate signing to bolster @entity2 's spine			1
the @entity141 man is eager to get away from a side who are selling the majority of their key players			2
one point which is often brought up to reference @entity2 's failures in years gone by is lack of strength , both mentally and physically			0
but this squad would have the experience and sheer size to challenge on all fronts			0
the @entity30 kit launch on thursday stressed the message ; @entity157			0
strong : @entity137 could bolster @entity2 's spine believe : @entity130 , @entity64 and @entity160 are depicted in front of the @entity163 eye tear jerker : @entity25 gave an inspiration speech for the @entity30 kit launch on thursday away kit launch : but @entity168 will find it tough to break into the starting eleven this season midfield options : @entity171 will be looking to turn potential into consistency with all these impressive changes going on in @entity163 , it may be hard for young @entity74 stars @entity171 and @entity168 to make a permanent impression on the first team			1
both were affected by injuries last season , and will have been looking to kick on as they turn teenage stardom into consistency on the pitch			0
saying that , they certainly have the potential to make an impact from the bench , as well as @entity188			0
@entity160 will be another key member of the squad at the @entity190 , though the 29 - year - old misses out here due to the thought of @entity9 and @entity79 racing through on goal from the flanks , the @entity191 is also linked with a move back to his homeland			1
unveiled : but @entity160 has been linked with a return to @entity200 this summer in today , gone tomorrow ? @entity201 is expected to leave the club this summer abject : there were too many horror shows away from home last season the early transfer window movement is already triggering thoughts of an intriguing title race			0
@entity211 ( who were beaten to the signing of @entity9 ) , though selling @entity214 , have strengthened their squad in @entity217 and @entity216			0
@entity218 are building a new legacy with @entity220 and @entity221 under @entity222			0
@entity223 made the biggest early impact this summer by announcing @entity225 and @entity226 , but @entity2 may well have trumped them with a signal of intent			0
make no mistake , the @entity51 are in the hunt this year			0
and do n't be surprised to see them end that 10 - year wait for a title			0
team spirit : @entity2 are looking to bring the good times back to @entity163 @entity88 duo : @entity188 and @entity237 in the new @entity2 kit injury troubles : former @entity241 duo @entity240 and @entity60 will be hoping for better seasons competition : @entity244 and @entity245 will be fighting for the left - back berth experience : @entity248 and @entity249 are two of the eldest in the @entity2 group			2

@entity9 signs from @entity10 for £ 30m on thursday
he gives @entity25 many options in attack , with @entity64 and @entity79
@entity2 can finally win @entity4 title again with world - class players
@entity86 will improve with more pace playing around him
@entity111 set to sign for £ 10m from @entity262
@entity137 could come in from @entity141 to strengthen midfield
@entity171 and @entity168 *unlucky* to miss out on predicted starting @entity266
