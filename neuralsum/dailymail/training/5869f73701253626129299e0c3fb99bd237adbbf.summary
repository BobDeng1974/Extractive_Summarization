struck by an overwhelming sense of nausea , @entity0 thought she was suffering a bout of food poisoning			1
returning from work last monday the 19 - year - old made a dash for the bathroom			2
but rather than a nasty case of gastroenteritis , the teenager was shocked to be in the early stages of labour			2
miss @entity0 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , had no idea she was pregnant			1
she developed no tell - tale bump and just a month before giving birth to her surprise daughter @entity21 , the teenager had worn a bikini on a beach holiday in @entity24 - where partner @entity25 works			1

miss @entity0 said : ' i had absolutely no idea			1
' i made sunday dinner the night before and was up all night with sickness and thought i had given myself food poisoning			2
ms @entity47 , of the @entity48 said although miss @entity0 ’s situation is uncommon , it is not unusual			1
she said : ‘ some women just do n’t know they are pregnant ‘ one lady was serving in @entity53 and did n’t realise she was pregnant , and we had to send services out there			2
‘ it might happen for a variety of reasons			0
it ’s different for any women			0
‘ there are some women with good abdominal muscles and fat and the baby lies flat against the back so they do n’t have a bump			2
‘ some women wo n’t have the normal pregnancy symptoms			0
‘ some women feel the baby moving inside them , but some do n’t			2
‘ a lot of the symptoms of pregnancy are ‘ everyday ’ symptoms			0
so they might not know that having wind is a sign of pregnancy			0
especially if they ’ve never had a baby			0
’ ‘ not all women are body - conscious			0
it depends on what ’s going on in their life			0
’ in these cases , the midwife has an important role in supporting the new family , as adjusting to being a parents can be a shock			0
she said : ‘ the women themselves are totally shocked when it happens to them			0
‘ a lot of talking and reassurance by the midwife is needed			0
‘ they need to say the occurrence is unusual but the woman herself is not abnormal			0
‘ that woman is going to need a lot of help and support adjusting to being a parent			0
‘ women with unplanned pregnancies get very upset , so imagine one day you have a normal life and the next you are a parent			0
‘ the midwife would give that woman a lot more care , watching for signs of post-natal depression or even post-natal unhappiness			2
’ ' i went to work on monday morning , came back at 5pm , went to the toilet and that is when my partner 's mother realised that i was having a baby and she delivered her on the bathroom floor with the help of my partner 's sister			1

@entity21 , who weighed 7lbs 9oz , was perfectly healthy when she was born			2
mother and baby were taken to hospital for a check - up and spent two nights on the maternity ward while experts monitored their progress			2
' the paramedics took us in because it was such a shock for everyone , ' miss @entity0 said			1
' i did everything you 're not supposed to do when you 're pregnant , ' she explained two months before giving birth she enjoyed a trip to @entity156 and flew on holiday just a month before her daughter 's arrival			1

' miss @entity0 was lucky enough not to worry about telling her work colleagues that she had to take last - minute maternity leave as her father is the boss of the company			2
