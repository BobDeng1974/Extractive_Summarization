by @entity1 medical correspondent intense physio sessions to help car crash victims recover from whiplash injury offer no more relief than a one - off consultation , claim researchers			1

intense physio sessions to help car crash victims recover from whiplash injury offer no more relief than a one - off consultation researchers from the @entity22 have claimed but the study shows a one - off meeting with a physio , information leaflet and follow - up telephone call were enough to help them cope with pain			1
pain expert dr @entity30 , of @entity22 in @entity31 , said ' our study provides further evidence that prolonged expensive clinical interventions for chronic whiplash injury are no more effective than briefer treatment programs that teach the patient how to self - manage their pain			2
' between september 2009 and february 2012 researchers randomly allocated 172 chronic whiplash patients to one of two types of recovery programme			1
there were still almost half a million whiplash compensation claims in 2012 and the government is planning a crackdown on whiplash injury fraud they had all been in a motor accident over three months before the trial began , but no more than five years had passed since being injured , says a report in @entity56 medical journal			2
one group received just a single half - hour consultation with a trained physiotherapist who went over a pamphlet that provided information on whiplash - related disorders , suggestions on how to self - manage pain , and a simple exercise routine			0
they could telephone the physio for advice if needed , but this was limited to two calls			0
a second group were given 20 one - hour , bespoke physiotherapy sessions during a 12 - week programme			2
the sessions used posture re-education , stretching training and exercises , scapular training , aerobic exercise , and strength training to help recovery			0
researchers found that for both groups pain was reduced at 14 weeks , six months , and 12 months after the first session and there were ' no clinically meaningful differences ' between the two			0
dr @entity30 said ' the need to identify effective and affordable strategies to prevent and treat musculoskeletal disorders should be an important health priority			0
' this is especially true for those with chronic whiplash - associated disorders because most patients have tried and failed previous treatments , and their continuing symptoms mean they would be unlikely to pursue more of the same approaches			0

insurers say these claims cost them more than £ 2billion in payouts and lead to an average premium increase of £ 90 for drivers .			1
