ten owners in an @entity6 tenement were given the original quote to repair a leak in a flat roof			1
the full scale of the outrageous charges was only revealed when one of the residents used the @entity14 to get official files			2
council battle : @entity17 and @entity18 outside their tenement on @entity21 @entity17 , 67 , has been battling the council for five years over its handling of what should have been a simple , affordable repair			1
the residents of the building in leafy @entity28 believe much of the work was unnecessary and made matters worse			1
@entity6 council has been at the centre of a long - running repairs scandal which has seen seen council workers accused of taking bribes and favouring certain companies for construction jobs			1
contractors have also been accused of charging up to 20 times the estimate and just today it emerged that one of the council 's most senior officials has been suspended in the wake of an investigation			1
mr @entity17 said : ' it all started five years ago when the council were called in to repair a flat roof			1
' it was just a leak			0
we had had a quote for £ 700 , but two people in the block objected so we had to get the council in			2
' they said we needed a whole new roof			1
two years later work started and at that time the quote was £ 65,000 , which i do n't think was necessary			0
' by august 2009 , the estimated cost had reached £ 230,000 - almost £ 20,000 per flat			0
mr @entity17 and his partner @entity18 , 60 , received @entity14 files last week , which contained the bill for the work			0

' the roof at the top of the tenement on @entity75 : the original work was simply intended to fix a small leak the property repairs scandal has already begun to claim scalps at the very top of @entity6 council			1

meanwhile , the @entity28 homeowners have still not received an official bill for their roof repair			1

he said : ' we are quite convinced there are things in these letters they do n't want us to see			0
they fought tooth and nail to stop us getting them			0
' i have letters from experts saying it was totally unnecessary , badly done and a complete mess			0

she also said @entity135 failed to provide information to mr @entity17 about tenement repairs			2
in her first three reports since taking up the post in may , commissioner @entity130 said the council did not answer specific questions initially , then gave broad information and only eventually provided the relevant details			2
although she did not order the council to take any further action , the commissioner was satisfied that ' although mr @entity17 has raised his concerns in relation to a specific property , the council 's management of statutory notices , both in general and in specific cases , is a matter of general public interest '			1
she added : ' given the serious nature of the concerns raised , there is a strong public interest in understanding the work of the council in this area			0
