the stadium announcer cleared his throat , took a sharp intake of breath and giddily announced : ‘ welcome to the start of a new era at the home of the world ’s greatest football club , the home of @entity10			1
’ moments later , the players arrived onto the field but all the eyes and smartphones skewed anxiously to catch a glimpse of the new manager , @entity17 , who immersed himself to almost disappear amid the hustle and bustle			1
there was no grand entrance , no banners draped over the @entity23 , no aeroplanes flying low over the @entity26 skyline			1
suited up in @entity10 colours , he strode purposefully down the touchline carrying a folder , offering a regal wave to the supporters and flashing a wide grin to the cameras vying for his attention			2
just another day at work for the 63 - year - old who has managed @entity55 powerhouses @entity54 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
afterwards , he allowed himself to indulge a little , lauding his first evening at @entity26 as a ‘ fantastic ’ experience and smiling when this last - gasp win was compared to the sir @entity61 victories of yesteryear			1
before the match , it was business as usual			0
as is habit for @entity67 , he wandered out to observe his players pre-match warm - up , focusing the minds on the challenge ahead			2
as he shuffled across the @entity26 pitch to take pride of place in front of the sir @entity61 stands , @entity78 ’s 1976 classic @entity79 echoed out out the speakers , the air - horns sounded and @entity26 bellowed its approval			1
time for the hairdryer ? @entity17 follows his players into the dressing room at half - time right hand man : @entity17 and assistant @entity87 ( @entity88 ) watch the game from the dugout @entity91 selected to lead @entity29 ' revival it feels an age since since this famous old stadium has felt such a contented place			1
as the players performed their stretches and shuttle - rins , the warm ovation was born out of affection , rather than anxiety , as was so often the case during those fraught days under @entity104 last season			2
when the players walked back into the dressing room , @entity67 followed behind , waving either arm in the air and giving a high - five to @entity110 as he entered the tunnel			0
it was that sort of night at @entity113			0
as the action began , @entity67 reclined into that red leather chair , worn - in for so many years by @entity61 and vacated after just 10 months by @entity104			0
@entity104 , in truth , could never really sit still , taking sanctuary on the touchline and gesticulating furiously to his players			0
that , to be fair , is his style of management but there is no question that @entity10 players welcome a return to the sir @entity61 model , offering trust to the players and stern rebukes only when necessary			2
fletch lives ! @entity132 opened the scoring for @entity10 in the second half hair raising ! @entity10 misfit @entity136 scored a late winner despite being linked with a move @entity67 barely ventured to the dugout , instead scribbling notes on his pad , ready to correct @entity10 ’s faults in the more tranquil surroundings of the dressing room			1
in the stands , a host of @entity10 players watched on , dressed immaculately in club suits			2
@entity148 , the under 21 coach , accompanied injured players @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 in the directors box , along with those overlooked such as @entity156 and @entity157			0
@entity158 remains a little short of fitness and he sat close to young @entity161 , invited to be a part of the senior group after four goals in the @entity166 final against @entity167 last week			0
when they went to depart before the half - time whistle , they moved as a group , uniformed and orderly , clearly on the instructions of @entity67			0
get used to it : @entity17 waves to fans as he leaves the pitch following @entity10 's 2 - 1 victory this friendly game had been branded as reunited by the @entity10 marketing department in the days leading and after the fractious outpourings of the past 12 months , it seemed rather fitting			1
slowly but surely , @entity67 is knitting this club back together once more			0
