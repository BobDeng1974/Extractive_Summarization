@entity0 has accrued players worth a total of £ 150million , been handed a gentle list of fixtures to begin the campaign , and was afforded breathing room from the pressure of continuing sir @entity9 ’s legacy			1
but , remarkably , the stunning defeat by @entity11 means @entity12 have started this season worse than they did under @entity14			1
with @entity14 in charge , @entity12 gained seven points from their opening five @entity19 games – as well as picking up victories in the @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 – while @entity24 has collected only five points and was dumped out of the @entity23 4 - 0 by @entity26			1
@entity0 ( centre ) reacts during @entity12 's humiliating defeat at @entity11 @entity14 endured a nightmare start as manager of @entity12 - but it was better than @entity24 's such early comparisons may turn out to be wholly erroneous but they are nonetheless alarming			1
@entity24 is a better fit for @entity12 than @entity14 , and his record shows he should get it right , but it is worth examining the context of @entity12 ’s current circumstances			1
16 aug - @entity39 ( @entity40 ) 1 - 2 24 aug - @entity41 ( a ) 1 - 1 30 aug - @entity42 ( a ) 0 - 0 14 sep - @entity43 ( @entity40 ) 4 - 0 21 sep - @entity11 ( a ) 3 - 5 17 aug - @entity39 ( a ) 4 - 1 26 aug - @entity44 ( @entity40 ) 0 - 0 1 sep - @entity45 ( a ) 0 - 1 14 sep - @entity46 ( @entity40 ) 2 - 0 22 sep - @entity47 ( a ) 1 - 4 united fans will not enjoy the @entity19 table as it stands today with the club in a lowly 12th position ... ... and here is the @entity19 table as it stood on september 22 , 2013 - with @entity12 in eighth position transfers during last summer ’s transfer window @entity14 believed @entity57 was going to land him a world - class central midfielder , with @entity60 the leading target			1
@entity62 looked on at one point and @entity64 too but instead @entity12 ended up scrambling to buy @entity65 for £ 27.5m on deadline day - £ 4m more than his buyout clause			2
there was an aborted last - minute deal for @entity70			0
@entity71 arrived in january for £ 37.1m but only played 12 games under @entity73			0
@entity24 splashed out £ 60m to bring @entity74 forward @entity75 to the club from @entity77 @entity65 was @entity14 's only big - money buy as @entity12 missed out on all their targets by contrast @entity24 walked into the job with @entity82 and @entity64 secured for a combined £ 60m , then sanctioned deals of £ 16m for @entity84 , £ 14m for @entity85 , and a @entity87 - record fee of £ 60m for @entity75			1
@entity88 arrived for a £ 6m loan price			2
but for all the glitz , graft was missing			0
@entity92 failed to materliaise and @entity93 is injured			0
@entity94 , the commanding defender @entity12 are crying out for , stayed in @entity96			2
@entity97 departed before @entity24 arrived			2
nonetheless , it is fair to say the @entity99 has been backed in the market more than his predecessor			2
tactics a classic 4 - 4 - 2 formation was the sole preserve for @entity14 in his first five league games ; two strikers , two wingers , two central midfielders and a flat back four			2
it was the system @entity9 used to make @entity12 great			1
at @entity111 , @entity14 had preferred a sole centre forward with his wide men tucking in but the players available in his new job dictated that was n’t possible			2
in the 4 - 1 defeat by @entity47 , however , 4 - 4 - 2 became rigid as his team were pulled apart by the fluid movement of their rivals			1
@entity24 has toyed with two different formations already			2
he employed a 3 - 5 - 2 system to begin with , having found success with it at the @entity125 with @entity126			1
but it is naturally a counter-attacking set - up at odds with @entity12 ’s ethos and the paucity of defenders made it a hindrance			2
no wins have come through using it so far			0
@entity85 ( left ) has been entrusted with the sizeable task of shoring up @entity12 's all - star midfield @entity139 perhaps best sums up @entity14 's insistence on using wingers in a 4 - 4 - 2 formation at @entity12 against @entity43 , @entity85 was handed the holding midfield role in a new diamond formation – 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 or 4 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 depending on your preference – as @entity75 and @entity64 drove forward from deep to support no 10 @entity71 and strikers @entity148 and @entity149			1
the win was exhilarating but it papered over defensive frailties that were ruthlessly exposed by @entity11			2
blind is asked to cover too much ground across the pitch and without experienced central defenders behind , or full - backs staying deeper , the problem is exacerbated			0
it might require another switch in formation to address the problem			0
@entity24 ’s history shows he is adaptable and innovative			2
substitutions part of the problem with @entity73 , from a supporters ’ point of view , was his apparent dawdling over changes during matches			0
it would seem he deliberated excessively over how to alter losing positions and only make substitutions when it was too late			0
only @entity174 was sent on during the defeat at the @entity176 while the goalless draw against a @entity44 team intent on defence could have benefited from attacking replacements earlier			0
@entity24 has not exactly shown the @entity181 from the bench yet either			0
@entity183 for @entity184 and @entity65 for @entity64 in the loss against @entity39 failed to work			0
against @entity11 we can only assume @entity75 was exhausted , otherwise taking him off for @entity71 with the score at 3 - 3 when the @entity74 was on song was bizarre			1
@entity24 has used his maximum of three changes in each match trying to test his entire squad , and on three occasions has been forced to make a switch because of injury			0
a stern looking @entity71 ( back right ) listens to his boss on the bench at @entity11 @entity14 was able to call on the likes of @entity201 , who is now at @entity202 , from the bench last season fixtures it is indisputable that @entity14 was handed harder opening games than @entity24			1
last season , @entity12 played three of the big boys in @entity45 , @entity44 , and @entity39 , with a trip to @entity39 and a home tie against newly - promoted @entity46 the ‘ easier ’ games ( both were won )			1
seven goals scored , six against			0
@entity24 ’s set of fixtures has been markedly more appealing , including matches against all three promoted teams plus a home match against @entity39 and visit to @entity41			0
nine goals were scored , with eight against , but given three matches in four from late october will come against @entity39 , @entity44 and @entity202 , @entity24 would surely have hoped for more points on the board			0
@entity225 celebrates scoring during @entity39 's shock opening - day victory at @entity228 @entity149 faces up to @entity12 's 4 - 1 derby defeat at rivals @entity47 under @entity14 last september public statements the area where @entity24 does trump @entity14 is in front of the cameras			1
whereas @entity14 seemed uncomfortable with the enormous focus on being @entity12 manager , @entity24 carries an aura and speaks with confidence			1
within a short period after the list was released @entity14 was railing against the fixture computer and hinting at the hard run being somehow contrived			1
there were also regular blasts at referees			0
@entity9 was obviously never shy to venture down such routes but from @entity14 it transmitted a sense of early excuse - making			1
( words such as ‘ try ’ and ‘ hope ’ peppered his interviews , much to the irritation of supporters familiar with bold declarations of @entity12 ’s intent			0
) captain @entity149 rages at referee @entity259 during the 5 - 3 defeat at the @entity261 @entity14 never gave off an air of authority in the same way that sir @entity9 did at @entity12 compared with @entity24 , who declined the chance to blame @entity259 for his officiating in awarding @entity11 ’s highly - dubious first penalty on sunday			1
‘ i do n't know if it is a penalty but we have to look at ourselves because we made such big errors as a team , ’ he said			0
there will be occasions when the officials get blamed but in the context @entity24 had to accept @entity12 ’s failings were the cause for their capitulation			1
from that mentality , he can address the faults			0
like our @entity12 facebook page here .			0

@entity12 crashed to a 5 - 3 defeat at @entity11 on sunday
@entity0 's team were 3 - 1 up but collapsed in the second half
@entity24 has spent big money on @entity75 , @entity88 and more
the @entity99 has also had a relatively *simple* fixture list
but @entity24 's start is even worse than @entity14 's last term
@entity14 took over from sir @entity9 in summer of 2013
@entity297 was sacked in april after less than a season in charge
