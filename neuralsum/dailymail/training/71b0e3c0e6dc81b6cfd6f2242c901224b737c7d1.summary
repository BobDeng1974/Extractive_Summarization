@entity1 star @entity0 could be handed the @entity3 captaincy for next month 's friendly against @entity4 in @entity5			1
@entity3 manager @entity6 is without international skippers @entity8 and @entity9 , who are both rested from the june 4 encounter			1
and while @entity6 is keeping his cards close to his chest about who will lead @entity3 against the @entity16 - bound @entity15 , it is thought that 24 - year - old @entity0 is in pole position			1
video : scroll down for @entity0 : it 's been an exciting campaign and we 'll be 100 % ready thumbs up : @entity0 in preparation for saturday 's @entity24 final with @entity1 arrival : the world 's most expensive footballer could be handed the @entity3 captaincy next month key men : he and @entity31 will be spearheading @entity1 's hopes of a 10th @entity34 title he has already won the @entity35 in his first season with @entity1 , scoring a spectacular winning goal to defeat @entity38 , while he will be part of an all - @entity40 @entity24 final against @entity41 in @entity42 on saturday			1
' i have got the captain , but he does not know it yet			0
he will know it soon , ' said @entity6 , after naming a 23 - man squad for the @entity4 clash			1
' there will be another captain , and i will have that conversation with him			0
' @entity6 believes the @entity15 game will be " an invaluable experience " despite being without several key players			1
@entity56 's @entity55 final hero @entity8 , @entity57 captain @entity9 , @entity59 's @entity58 and @entity61 defender @entity60 are among the absentees , while reserve goalkeeper @entity63 has confirmed his retirement from international football			1
@entity6 , though , has @entity0 at his disposal , while there is also a chance for promising uncapped young talent like @entity71 's @entity70 and @entity73 defender @entity72			1
@entity75 heart : the 24 - year - old already has 44 caps for his national team prize assets : he and @entity56 midfielder @entity8 are the jewels in @entity6 's crown ' we have been building , doing well and picking up momentum and this is another game and another chance for us , ' he added			1
' as an international manager , you want to climb the rankings , and to do that you need some results against some juicy teams			1
you can arrange friendly games against weaker opposition , and while it looks good that you 've won a game , you do n't learn a lot and you do n't go anywhere in the rankings			2
' we have tried to pick strong opposition , and they do n't come much stronger than this one			0
it will be good for us			0
' if we lose more ( players ) , then we do			0
we have to get on with it , but the lads there will get the experience against a very good @entity15 team going to the @entity16 , and it will be an invaluable experience			0
' normally , i would n't take a game ( on june 4 ) , but it 's @entity4 in @entity5			2
we took it also because this time next year we will be preparing for @entity114 in a ( @entity116 ) qualifier , so there are two reasons why we took the game			0
' @entity8 will be rested after a season that saw him sidelined for four months with a thigh injury , before making his comeback towards the campaign 's latter stages , along with the likes of @entity60 , @entity9 and @entity9 ' @entity57 colleague @entity126			1
rested : @entity57 pair @entity126 and @entity9 will miss the game as they need to rest finalist : @entity72 started , and scored , in the 3 - 2 @entity55 loss against @entity56 at @entity131 decisions : @entity6 will be hoping to lead the @entity75 team to @entity134 ' we had a good conversation , ' said @entity6 , regarding @entity8			1
' we thought he can come with us ( to @entity4 ) , but we think he needs a good rest			2
' he is a loss , of course he is , and we are a better team when he is with us , that 's obvious			0
but we did n't want to take the risk , neither did @entity8 , nor @entity56 , i would have thought			2
' @entity126 and @entity9 have got the same problem ( injury ) and they need a good rest			2
' they rarely miss games or training , they 've got great attitudes , it 's just they have finished the season with @entity57 and now they need rest with the injuries that they 've got			0
' uncapped @entity159 , meanwhile , played in @entity73 's @entity55 final defeat against @entity56 last weekend , when @entity8 scored the winning goal , although @entity163 boss @entity162 then said his player would not be available to tackle @entity4			1
' we will not be taking the risk , ' @entity6 said			2
' if there is a problem we will not risk him , simple as that			0
' but i spoke to @entity171 [ @entity162 ] and @entity72 last week and we are looking forward to having him			0
he is another member of the squad , another @entity173 player which we think will help and improve us			0
' we can not say he is coming in and he will definitely start			0
he will need to come through the sessions , and we will see how he is			0
