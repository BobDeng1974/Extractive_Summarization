when @entity1 was asked on tuesday about @entity3 players not believing in their coach , he told the @entity6 journalist asking the question that the same enquiry could easily have been made of @entity10 ’s manager @entity9 just two months earlier			1
he was spot - on too			0
back at the start of january @entity10 ’s head coach sat ghost - like through press conferences – a condemned man after a fall - out with the one man at @entity10 you do n’t fall - out with – @entity19			2
@entity10 had just been beaten 1 - 0 by @entity21 ' @entity20 , the president @entity22 had sacked sporting director @entity23 and called elections for the end of the season			1
@entity19 's ( left ) fall out with manager @entity9 was the pinnacle of @entity10 's drama behind the scenes before the first game of the season @entity9 seemed a condemned man but , given his team 's form , he 's a happy man ahead of his side 's @entity36 second leg clash with @entity3 serve and protect : @entity38 gives a serious salute next to the @entity10 logo in this @entity42 post and @entity43 had gone on a one - man media mission to convince everyone that all talk of training ground bust - ups and sour air in the @entity10 dressing room was the product of reporters ’ fertile imagination			1
and off - message @entity55 defender @entity54 admitted as such in an interview with @entity55 radio saying that @entity19 had indeed had a heated argument with @entity9 in a training session before the first game of the year			1
since that defeat by @entity20 , @entity10 have devoured all that has been put before them barring one slip against @entity66			0
@entity67 is still setting up team - mates as he was towards the end of last year but he is now in the kind of scoring form that saw him win the @entity74 last season , and @entity19 has gone from being 12 goals behind @entity76 in the @entity77 scoring stakes to two goals in front him			1
@entity20 celebrate their victory over @entity10 on january 4 that coincided with the sacking of sporting director @entity23 and president @entity22 calling for elections for the end of the season @entity55 defender @entity54 ( left ) admitted @entity19 and @entity9 had a heated argument during training what happened ? player power is what happened			1
what most upset squad members at the start of the year is that three of their number – @entity94 , @entity19 and @entity38 – had been given permission to come back slightly later than the rest from the mid-winter break but were then left out of that first game of the new year because , according to @entity9 , they had not trained sufficiently			2
the players had had enough of the mixed messages and of the constant changes in starting line - ups			2
and they made themselves heard			0
@entity67 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) laugh during training on tuesday ahead of their meeting with @entity3 from that moment on @entity9 ’s team changes were drastically reduced			1
he began to leave out one star - player at a time instead of making wholesale changes and with the emphasis now on the players to deliver because they had won their internal battle with the coach they began performing at a level not seen since @entity118 was in charge two seasons before			0
there are still disagreements between coach and players			0
@entity67 was unhappy about being taken off two weeks ago and at the weekend @entity38 responded in the same way when he was taken off at @entity125			0
neither would it be fair to say that @entity9 is now a puppet being made to dance solely to @entity19 ’s tune			2
one of his strengths as a manager is that he gets the players fit and keeps them fit throughout the season , and @entity10 players look strong with 11 games left to play plus the @entity137 final			0
one of @entity9 's strengths is keeping players fit and @entity10 's squad looks strong with 12 games left to play the manager has loosened the reigns since january 's blow up and his team is now difficult to stop his assistant @entity146 should also be credited with the transformation in the way they take and defend corners			1
@entity10 had taken over 100 set plays at the start of the season without making a training ground routine render a single goal on the pitch			1
but all that has changed of late with ‘ unusual ’ suspects @entity159 and @entity19 both getting their heads to important corners – @entity162 with an assist and @entity19 scoring his first header from a corner in his @entity167 career			0
@entity9 has played his part in the revival but it ’s also been a change in him that has seen @entity10 ’s form transformed			2
it seemed he was trying too hard to put his stamp on the team towards the end of last year ; trying to hard to show his multimillionaire players who was boss			0
since january he has loosened the reigns – and in response his thoroughbred team have hit the front and will be difficult to stop .			0
