by @entity0 published : 19:06 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 11:46 est , 13 march 2013 having to keep the peace between family , friends , ex-partners and mothers - in - law over the fraught festive period is familiar to many of us			2
if you ’re super-rich pop svengali @entity11 , there ’s only one solution : throw money at it			0
over the past two weeks , @entity11 is thought to have spent £ 750,000 on keeping both his mother @entity16 and his on - off girlfriend @entity17 happy in the @entity18			1
during @entity23 week , for example , which @entity11 and his entourage spent on the island of @entity25 , the impresario put @entity16 , 85 , in a £ 2,000 - a - night hotel suite			1
meanwhile , 39 - year - old @entity17 , @entity11 ’s ex-fiancée , was anchored 200 yards offshore on a lavish private yacht			1
does she lack the @entity28 ? @entity11 only has eyes for his @entity31 magazine and mobile phone while holidaying this week with his ex-fiancee @entity33 @entity11 is thought to have spent £ 750,000 on keeping his mother and on - off girlfriend happy in the @entity18 the cost of this operation ? well , let ’s just say that @entity11 wo n’t have had much change from £ 350,000			1
and even that figure amounts to less than half of the £ 750,000 the entire three - week holiday is likely to have cost him by the time he gets home			2
first , there is the £ 270,000 cost of hiring the 196ft , super-yacht @entity49 for a week			0
this floating palace can accommodate 12 people and is staffed by 14 crew to attend to the @entity28 supremo ’s every whim			1
then there is the bill for putting his mother in the @entity59 hotel , where rooms start at £ 740 - a - night			1
on top of that is the bill for business class flights @entity11 paid to bring everyone together			0
but with a net worth thought to be upwards of £ 225 million , he can afford such extravagances			0
indeed , it was reported yesterday that newly filed accounts showed his tv firm had doubled earnings last year — income was up £ 20 million in @entity74 and £ 26 million in the @entity75			0
on the @entity81 ’s leg of his holiday in his traditional winter haunt of @entity84 , he installed @entity85 and another ex-lover , @entity79 singer @entity78 , in a shared palatial apartment at a cost of a £ 20,000 a night			1
@entity11 and makeup artist @entity17 arrive at the 18th annual @entity88 's @entity87 nor are they the only ones benefiting from his largesse			1
as well as @entity78 ’s two adopted children , the private complex where he has been staying has played host to a freewheeling contingent of guests — including several young men with perfectly tanned , hairless bodies , laid on as eye candy for @entity78 and @entity101 — who have been sunning themselves by his pool			1
the only person missing from the party is @entity11 ’s current girlfriend , 40 - year - old @entity107 model and former @entity109 star @entity108 , who he recently described as ‘ adorable ’ , though not adorable enough , clearly , to accompany him and his exes on holiday			1
at the centre of this gathering is @entity11 , 53 , orchestrating proceedings and playing benevolent host			0
although he often sees in the @entity81 in @entity84 , this year he has upgraded from his usual suite of rooms at the island ’s five - star @entity119 hotel			1
while the hotel has , at various times , welcomed @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and the @entity127 , @entity11 has deemed the old @entity119 not quite smart enough for him			2
this year he has checked into the hotel ’s new and even more luxurious sister property , one @entity119 , which makes the ritzy original seem like a @entity131 by comparison			1
the extended @entity11 clan is staying in a £ 16 million purpose - built suite , one of eight lavish dwellings in the complex , built out of local coral stone and with its own private beach			1
his apartment has 14ft - high ceilings , @entity143 marble floors , ebony and walnut fittings and five bedrooms , all with en suite bathrooms			2
@entity150 to its appeal is its privacy			0
the complex boasts a security centre in the basement that operates on biometrics — typically retina - scanning or fingerprinting — meaning guests do n’t need room keys			2
any autograph hunters , unwelcome fans or paparazzi immediately set off the sophisticated alarm system			0
there is also a private butler and a chef ( who has been making healthy green smoothies and skinny muffins for @entity11 , who is determined not to put on weight before filming begins on the new series of @entity173 ’s @entity172 in mid-january )			2
annual getaway : @entity11 played with his short locks as @entity17 adjusted her bikini top tools for the perfect tan : @entity11 made sure to apply a coating of sun protector during his lounging session he also has a personal trainer — @entity183 — to put him through a twice - daily workout in the private @entity185 is not to say there has n’t been time for chilling out with friends such as one - time @entity190 @entity189 — who is ‘ celebrating ’ her divorce from former @entity194 footballer @entity193 — and another long - time chum , showbiz agent @entity196 , who are both staying on the island			1
but even close friends wonder why @entity11 has chosen to spend his holiday with @entity17 , an @entity202 - born , @entity201 - raised make - up artist			1
after all , within months of presenting her with a £ 250,000 diamond ring from jeweller ’s @entity205 following their engagement on @entity208 2010 , he had summarily called off their wedding , dubbing the whole thing a ‘ big mistake ’			0
it was believed he could n’t tolerate her jealousy over his close relationships with several of his ex-girlfriends			0
nor was he prepared to compromise on his obsessive work routine			0
in a best - selling biography of @entity11 , published last spring , journalist @entity218 told a story that added insult to miss @entity17 ’s injury			1
@entity223 revealed that not long after the engagement , @entity11 returned home late one night from recording @entity226 , on which he was a judge , and found himself having an argument with @entity17			1
his furious fiancée lashed out at him , in front of his widowed mother			2
@entity16 is quoted in @entity223 ’s book as saying : ‘ the tension was horrendous			1
the way @entity17 behaved made my stomach churn			1
’ within weeks , the engagement was off			0
@entity11 , however , believes in maintaining good relations with his former girlfriends			0
he gives them access to his large chequebook , and in return they do n’t blab embarrassing secrets about their time together			0
@entity244 and @entity17 are reconciled sufficiently to holiday together			1
and @entity17 is n’t the only ex-girlfriend keeping @entity11 company			2
despite splitting from him in 2006 , @entity78 has been a regular holiday companion , happily lining up on the sun loungers next to other old flames such as @entity250 and @entity251			2
some reading for the sun : the 53 - year - old held a copy of @entity31 close to his chest on the @entity81 ¿ s leg of his holiday in his traditional winter haunt of @entity84 , @entity11 installed @entity85 and another ex-lover , @entity79 singer @entity78 , in a shared palatial apartment at a cost of a £ 20,000 a night she flew out to join @entity11 on his yacht three days before @entity23 with her children , @entity265 , seven , and five - year - old @entity266			1
their host later had the task of explaining to the children how @entity23 managed to get on to the boat and leave presents for them on christmas morning			0
all this week , @entity78 — who is due to travel on to @entity273 with @entity11 over the coming days — has been posting breathless tweets about her partying till as late as 7am with the man she calls ‘ @entity11 ’			2
@entity78 , who says she is 44 , has also posted pictures of at least two of the young men , in their early 20s , who have been part of @entity11 ’s loose party of guests , referring to them jokingly as her ‘ toy boys ’			2
certainly , they have all been treated royally by their host			0
when one handsome lad — who had earlier been photographed in a pair of lurid pink trunks larking on the steps of the property with @entity78 — flew home to @entity296 , he was taken to the airport in a top - of - the - line @entity298			1
@entity11 , who has denied claims made by @entity223 that he had a breakdown in the summer , has looked relaxed in photographs taken during this long @entity18 break			0
@entity17 showed off her immaculate bikini body as she laid by @entity11 wearing a collarless white shirt slashed open almost to the waist , he joined revellers at a party at @entity119 to see in the @entity81 , posing gamely for pictures with a @entity311 - based , @entity310 - born male model called @entity312			1
on thursday he was photographed reclining on the deck of his yacht reading a copy of @entity31 magazine while @entity17 lay beside him in a turquoise snake - print bikini drinking a cocktail			1
but this holiday could be the calm before the storm			0
@entity11 faces a tough year as he attempts to restore ‘ @entity329 ’ to its former glory after both the @entity75 and @entity74 versions of @entity327 slumped in the ratings			0
a disappointing 9.3 million tuned in to the final of the @entity173 series last month , 1.3 million fewer than the previous year			0
meanwhile , in the @entity333 , the show was trounced by @entity334 and he faces having to sack @entity335 , whom he signed as a judge for the most recent season , but who has proved unpopular with viewers			0
even on this most relaxing of holidays , there has been a sense of storm clouds gathering			0
unsurprisingly , perhaps , there have been tense words between @entity101 and @entity78			2
it was n’t hard to spot the stiff body language when the two women flanked their host at a charity auction for the island ’s @entity352 animal welfare centre the other night			0
there will be those , of course , who say that by inviting his former lovers on his £ 750,000 getaway , @entity11 is only getting what he deserves			0
this article has been amended to reflect concerns raised about references to mrs @entity363 .			0
