by @entity0 shopping on @entity2 ’s bustling @entity1 may be bad for your bank balance			1
but now there is evidence that it is detrimental to your health too , as it has been shown to have the highest levels of toxic air in the world			0
a scientist has revealed that the busy stretch of shops has the highest levels of nitrogen dioxide ( @entity17 ) , which is produced by diesel fumes and can trigger asthma and heart attacks			1
noticeable symptoms include wheezing , coughing , colds , flu , and bronchitis			0
@entity38 , of @entity39 , told @entity40 that he has recorded peak levels of 463 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre of air , which is over three times higher than the average amount of the pollutant since the start of the year			1
he told the newspaper : ' to my knowledge , this [ level ] is the highest in the world in terms of both hourly and annual mean			0
@entity17 concentrations [ in @entity1 ] are as high as they ever have been in the long history of air pollution			1
' even at the average , 135 milligrams per cubic metre , the nitrogen dioxide levels are three times higher than the @entity65 ’s safety limit			1
the street broke hourly limits of 200 milligrams per cubic metre more than 1,500 times during the year			1
dr @entity38 told @entity69 [ @entity1 ] is easily the highest annual mean @entity17 concentration in @entity71			2
' @entity72 and @entity73 , which are frequently pictured with smoggy skies , have average levels of @entity17 at 62 micrograms per cubic metre in comparison			1
in february , figures from the @entity79 claimed that traffic travelling along the @entity81 - known as @entity82 - which runs adjacent to @entity83 , produced the highest levels of the toxic gas at an average of 152 micrograms per cubic metre of air in 2012			1
the study also found that @entity1 was highly polluted , registering at an average of 150 micrograms near @entity91 , while @entity92 has an average of 138 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre of air			1
not amused : in february , figures from the @entity79 claimed that traffic travelling along the @entity81 - known as @entity82 - which runs adjacent to @entity83 ( pictured ) produced the highest levels of toxic gas nitrogen dioxide at 152 micrograms per cubic metre of air @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 were all found to have seriously high levels of the pollutant			1
bosses from the collection of shops down @entity2 ’s most famous high street are calling on mayor @entity109 to reduce the number of buses that crawl down @entity1			2
@entity112 , chief executive of @entity113 which represents traders in @entity1 , told @entity115 : ‘ we are working closely with the relevant @entity2 authorities to look at longer term traffic reduction initiatives and we are keen to see ideas rapidly put in place			0
businesses in the @entity121 want action			0
’ @entity123 said that it has already reduced the number of buses by a fifth , while hybrid engines on @entity2 ’s famous double decker ’s are set to cut the pollution problem			0
almost 30,000 people die every year due to respiratory problems caused by air pollution and nitrogen dioxide in particular has been linked to breathing issues			1
pollutant mapped : the study , which was released in february , measured the average nitrogen dioxide levels in different parts of the capital in 2012 , and found that @entity1 , @entity100 and @entity83 were among the polluted hotspots in @entity2 environmental groups criticised the state of affairs in february			1
@entity141 , founder and director of clean air in @entity2 , said : ' these levels of nitrogen dioxide ( @entity17 ) are nothing short of staggering			1
' @entity148 guideline is no human exposure in a single hour over 200 micrograms per cubic metre ( with an annual average guideline of 40 )			1
' the thought that hundreds of thousands or millions of tourists and @entity155 in a year may be exposed to air pollution this high is deeply troubling			0
' in @entity2 , we need the mayor to : ban the oldest cars emitting carcinogenic diesel exhaust as @entity162 did more than four years ago , remove the turning circle requirement that still forces cabbies to choose between two large diesel taxis if they want a new vehicle and reinstate phase 5 of the low emission zone that was a key commitment in the mayor ’s @entity169 until scrapped early last year			0
' he also needs to ensure his ultra-low emission zone for 2020 includes the roads with the highest @entity17 rather than excluding them which will force the most - polluting vehicles to join those avoiding the congestion charging zone and issue smog warnings to save lives , avoid hospitalisations and build public understanding of air pollution			2
the @entity185 faces fines of up to £ 300m from the @entity71 commission after they launched legal action due to a failure to reduce high levels of @entity17 air pollution from traffic			2
the commission said this was despite over a decade of warnings and several extensions and postponements given to the @entity185 government			0
other @entity71 countries have also failed to meet the air quality directive , the commission said			0
a @entity79 spokesman said : ' air quality has improved significantly in recent decades			0
just like for other member @entity202 , meeting the @entity17 limit values alongside busy roads has been a challenge			2
' that is why we are investing heavily in transport measures to improve air quality around busy roads and we are working with the @entity211 to ensure this happens as soon as possible			0
' the agency highlighted that the @entity185 meets the @entity65 air quality limit values for all other air pollutants			2
responding to the figures in february , a spokesman for @entity109 said : ‘ @entity2 ’s air quality is steadily improving , meeting legal limits for eight out of nine @entity65 regulated pollutants			2
' since the mayor was elected @entity17 emissions have reduced by 20 per cent and the number of people living in areas exceeding @entity17 limits has halved but he fully recognises the need to take further action			0
' this includes the introduction of the world 's first @entity230 in central @entity2 from 2020 , tougher requirements for taxis from 2018 and a £ 20million fund to tackle local problem areas			0
' these most ambitious measures will deliver enormous economic and environmental benefits for central @entity2 and will make this global city an even better place to live , work and visit			0

scientist from @entity39 recorded peak levels of 463 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre of air on @entity1
