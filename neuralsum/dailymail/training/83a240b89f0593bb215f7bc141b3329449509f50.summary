the @entity8 leader announced that he wants to ‘ change politics ’ by reducing the voting age for the first time since 1969 so politicians ‘ hear the voices of people that have n’t been heard for a long time ’			1
but he was quickly accused of bowing to pressure from his union paymasters by making the announcement – which comes seven months after @entity18 demanded @entity8 make votes for 16 - year - olds a manifesto pledge			1
the @entity21 added that the plan was one more worthy of a ‘ student ’ politician			1
it was also even denounced by one of mr @entity1 ’s own mps as ‘ utterly irrelevant ’			1
the @entity29 ’s move comes after @entity31 ’s first minister @entity30 did a deal with the @entity33 to allow 16 - and 17 - year - olds to vote in next year ’s independence referendum			0
in his speech , mr @entity1 said politicians should listen to the ‘ voices of young people demanding a job , the voices of young people who demand that we shoulder and do n’t shirk our responsibilities to the environment			2
’ he added : ‘ let ’s give a voice to these young people in our party			1
and let ’s give a voice to these young people in our democracy , let ’s give the vote to 16 - and 17 - year - olds and make them part of our democracy			0
’ the voting age in @entity59 was last reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969 but polls show that the public – and even most young people – do not support votes at 16			1
the @entity29 's move followed in the footsteps of @entity31 's first minister @entity30 , who did a deal with the coalition to allow 16 and 17 - year - olds to vote in the independence referendum @entity8 mp @entity67 said : ‘ i just think it ’s utterly irrelevant			1
it is opposed by most people in @entity59 , most adults anyway			0
it is the kind of thing that is an obsession of a tiny minority who think this kind of stuff matters , which it does not			0
‘ it is exactly the kind of middle - class dinner party issue that tofu - eaters throughout the country get really excited about			2
’ @entity88 , chairman of the @entity89 accused mr @entity1 of bowing to union demands @entity89 chairman @entity88 accused mr @entity1 of bowing to union demands			1
in the past , @entity8 has said the matter would be one on which @entity27 could have a free vote in @entity96			2
but on 27 february this year @entity18 , which has given @entity8 more than £ 9million since mr @entity1 became leader , put a submission to the party ’s policy review , demanding the party make a manifesto pledge to lower the voting age to 16			1
the union , run by @entity105 , said : ‘ young people should be given a stake in the political process by lowering the voting age to 16			1
’ labour insiders believe the party will benefit from the move to vote because the 16 - and 17 - year - old age group are considered more likely to vote in its favour			2
in august , shadow cabinet member @entity114 said votes at 16 would become official party policy , a move confirmed by mr @entity1 for the first time yesterday			0
mr @entity88 said : ‘ this is literally student politics from @entity1			1
' he ’s been weak on welfare : now he wants to tinker with voting ages instead			2
it shows trade union bosses are buying his policies			2
this year the unions demanded he politicise the classroom , with votes for youngsters who are still at school			0
today he has caved in			0
if he ’s too weak to stand up to the unions then he ’s too weak to stand up for ordinary hardworking people			0
’ @entity133 , of the @entity135 group , which manages the campaign votes at 16 , welcomed the plan as ‘ an important constitutional reform ... that will mean more young people participate in politics ’			1
other countries where voting is permitted at 16 include @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146			0
@entity8 has also abandoned its plan to cut vat from 20 to 17.5 per cent after warnings that the move would be unaffordable			1
the party ’s @entity152 spokesman @entity151 told @entity155 ’s @entity154 the temporary cut – which had been a centrepiece in its ‘ five - point plan for growth ’ and would have cost £ 12billion – was no longer necessary because the economy is starting to recover			1
a party source said the vat cut ‘ wo n’t be in the manifesto ’			2
@entity165 watches her husband shadow chancellor @entity166 gives his keynote speech to delegates @entity8 will today promise to make identity theft a specific criminal offence , in a bid to stem the tide of online crime			2
shadow home secretary @entity165 will tell the @entity8 conference that police are struggling to cope with net fraud			2
the @entity178 estimates that online crime in the retail sector alone costs £ 200million a year			0
although fraudsters can at present be convicted of a series of crimes , a @entity8 source yesterday that said the lack of an offence specifically relating to identity theft ‘ leads to some confusion about how to arrest or charge people ’			1
miss @entity165 will say : ‘ we live our lives online now – but criminals know that too			0
it ’s a big risk for business			0
and it ’s a big cost for all of us			0
‘ when the credit card companies and banks write off fraud we all lose out from higher charges			0
‘ the problem is escalating by the day			0
‘ the police ca n’t do this alone			0
they do n’t stand a chance			0
we need changes in the law to make it easier to prosecute identity theft			0
’ @entity8 would also set up a new quango , @entity209 , to co-ordinate action against online criminals .			1
