by @entity0 @entity1 is a classic novel which has inspired legions of schoolchildren and adults with its imaginative wit and satirical undertones			1
less inspiring , however , is the abandoned @entity8 theme park based on the 18th century book which was left to rot after closing down in 2001			1
the eerie centrepiece of the park is a 147ft statue of @entity1 himself being tied to the ground by the miniature @entity14 , who he encounters during his first adventure			1
@entity17 theme park opened near @entity18 ( pictured in the background ) in 1997 and features a huge 146ft - long statue of @entity1 the statue shows the moment when @entity1 is tied to the ground by @entity14 in the first of his adventures in the first of his four travels , @entity1 is kept as a pet by the @entity14 - a tiny version of a @entity31 royal family - and is eventually used as a weapon of war to help crush their rivals because the @entity14 are tiny - about a 12th the size of a human - their rivalries and squabbles are made to seem petty , a deliberate attack by @entity41 on the ruling classes of his day photographer @entity43 , 44 , visited the park to capture these images			1
he said : ' the giant @entity1 was unreal			2
entering the grounds i did n't see him right away , then as i delved deeper into the park he suddenly loomed out of the landscape			0
' it was such a momentous thing to stand in the presence of			0
it was the most amazing and surreal object i have ever seen			0
it felt so weird to lie in the palm of a giant man , while surrounded by the stunning scenery			0
' @entity17 theme park was built next to @entity60 near @entity62 's famous ' suicide forest ' - and close to the former headquarters of @entity64 , the religious cult responsible for 13 deaths in the @entity67 sarin nerve gas attack of 1995			1
the park closed in 2001 after failing to attract enough visitors and has been left to rot ever since the park is located close to @entity62 's suicide hotspot , so it is perhaps not surprising that people did n't come another nearby landmark is the former headquarters of a religious cult which launched the sarin gas attack on the @entity67 underground which killed 13 people in 1995 on top of the less - than - desirable location , the park 's only ride were a bobsleigh run and a mini-railway @entity17 opened its doors in 1997 , but four years later it was forced to close due to a lack of customers			1
some speculate the park attracted so few visitors because of the it 's proximity to such grim locations			1
@entity94 is the second most popular suicide spot in the world after the @entity97 in @entity98 , @entity99			0
more than 500 people are known to have taken their lives in the forest since 1950			0
the nearby village of @entity104 was home to the terrorist organisation @entity64 , which still has more than 1,000 adherents worldwide			0
it was used as a base for the production of nerve gas in the @entity67 subway attack			0
photographer @entity43 , 44 , visited the park to capture these images , describing it as ' unreal ' in the books @entity1 also visits the @entity116 , giants who live in a socialist - style utopia @entity1 briefly visits @entity62 in the novel , where he is asked to walk on an engraving of @entity121 , but declines in his final adventure , @entity1 is taken to the land of the @entity124 , where horses rule over human - like creatures called @entity127 mr @entity43 , of @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity99 said : ' i can see why the park did not last very long			1
i would not want to go to a fun theme park next to those sinister places			1
' which ever way you look at it , the park had a strange concept			0
why would you base a theme park on an 18th century @entity140 novel ? ' they only had a small amount of attractions there - a bobsled run and a simple railway			1
i 'm sure it was n't very much fun			0
' @entity1 , @entity41 's satirical classic , was first published in 1726 in 1726 , when @entity41 first published @entity1 , novels were in their infancy , and authors usually needed to travel the kingdom getting lords and ladies to sign up for copies of the finished product , and paying in advance , before they started writing - rather like crowd - sourcing today			1
this meant that there was @entity161 oversight on almost everything published , and writers had to be very careful about offending those in power			0
so instead of attacking royalty directly in his book , @entity41 resorted to satire to critique the ruling classes of the day			0
so the book uses far flung and fictional lands - including @entity62 - and their strange customs to attack @entity173 society			1
in the first book @entity1 travels to the land of the @entity14 , miniature people who adopt @entity1 as a pet and use him as a war weapon against their rivals			1
lilliputian society mirrored the @entity31 courts of the day , and trivialised their in - fighting and wars by literally making them tiny			0
in the end @entity1 falls foul of the @entity186 after the palace catches fire and without thinking @entity1 urinates on it to douse the flames , drenching the @entity191 in the process and earning himself a one - way ticket home			2
next @entity1 travels to the kingdom of the @entity116 , giants who live in a utopian socialist - style society in which everything is shared between everyone			2
@entity1 discusses the state of modern @entity31 with the @entity203 , who is upset by the use of cannons and guns , and can not understand human 's need to be cruel to one another			2
@entity1 tries to defend the practices , but can not find any logical reason for them			2
the third and fourth books contain the strangest of @entity1 's adventures , first to a land of floating islands filled with academics who subdue those beneath them by hurling rocks and threatening to drop the island on their heads			2
@entity1 then visits @entity226 on the way to @entity228 , a land populated by immortal men who get increasingly old but never actually die , and @entity231 , the home of a magician who helps @entity1 discuss history with the ghosts of old political figures			2
@entity62 , where the theme park is based , is then the next stop on @entity1 , before he is taken to the land of the @entity124 , a kingdom where horses are the masters and human - like creatures called @entity127 are the subordinates			1
the book ends as @entity1 eventually travels home to his wife , by this point convinced that humans are unclean and barbarous , and refuses to live in the house			0
instead he locks himself away , spending several hours a day speaking to his horses .			0

@entity17 theme park near @entity60 opened in 1997 but closed four years later
the park failed to attract enough visitors , despite housing a 147ft - tall statue of @entity1 himself
it is located close to @entity62 's biggest suicide hotspot , perhaps *suggesting* why few people came
since 2001 the park has been left to rot , and was photographed by 44 - year - old @entity43
