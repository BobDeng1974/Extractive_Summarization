‘ i thought it was the @entity53			0
but i can tell people in the same situation that it is not the @entity53			0
it should drive you on to succeed even more			0
' his career prospects seemed even more bleak when , after just two matches in three years , @entity0 was released by @entity11 in 2000			1
from there , it was the beetroot factory and part - time football with @entity64			1
it was a dark time for @entity0 , something he has not shied away from discussing			2
‘ after leaving @entity11 there was a period without a club , ' he said			2
' i did n’t have a contract , so i was n’t getting paid for four or five months			0
it was a very difficult time			0
i was debating what i could do outside the game			0
but i did n’t want to do anything outside of football			0
@entity76 faced : @entity0 ( left ) during his time with @entity64 , where he played part - time for a spell county set : @entity0 ( right ) moved to @entity80 and established himself as a lower - league player partnership : @entity82 was @entity0 's strike partner at @entity83 and also went played in the @entity84 ‘ so i was trying my best to get to training at @entity64 because it was n’t close			1
‘ i had to get a job and that one in the beetroot factory was one of the only jobs i could get at the time			2
i was putting lids on jars , getting paid £ 20 a day			0
i would work in the day and go training in the evening			0
' after a more successful spell at @entity80 , he really began his rise from bloke who worked with jars to being a star when @entity83 boss @entity99 moved him from midfield			1
@entity0 was 23 at the time and forged a formidable partnership with @entity82 and they scored 27 goals in 24 matches good move : @entity0 was a midfielder before @entity99 converted him to a striker at @entity83 net gains : @entity0 while he was at @entity109 , where his career carried on its upward trajectory three of @entity0 's former clubs are now non-league - @entity80 , @entity64 and @entity109 , who dropped down to the conference earlier this month			1
@entity116 ( last season 23rd in @entity117 , relegated ) @entity80 - @entity118 ( 2013 - 14 14th ) @entity119 ( 2013 - 14 15th ) it got the striker noticed by @entity109 and he moved there for £ 200,000			1
@entity123 signed him for £ 1million in 2009 but only became their main man after words of advice from former manager @entity127 , who told him to get in shape			1
‘ that really stuck , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ i was overweight , basically			0
i was n’t looking after my body the way i should have			0
’ he knuckled down and his goals have fired the @entity123 up two divisions and his @entity84 exploits led to an @entity18 debut			1
@entity0 headed the winner against @entity138 at @entity139 with his first touch after barely three minutes on the pitch			1
hitman : @entity0 continued his fine form at @entity109 , scoring one in every two games chasing his dream : @entity0 ( right ) playing for @entity109 against @entity147 kicking on : @entity0 really progressed at @entity109 ( right ) but took it to a new level at @entity123 after scoring he said : ' i dreamed of this all my life , it means so much			1
it was a great corner by @entity152 , where i wanted it and it was great to get on the end of it			0
' i 've tried to play it calm all week , when all i wanted to do was scream ! ' i do n't mind people talking about the beetroot factory - it shows how far i 've come			2
' it was great to have my family here			0
i 'm so happy for those who made it possible - my parents , my wife , three kids and @entity123			2
they 've been different class			0
' and he did not stop there			0
another international goal followed against @entity174 a month later and he played a key role in a gritty 0 - 0 draw with @entity177			0
