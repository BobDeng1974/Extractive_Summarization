by @entity0 a family dog helped snare a burglar after biting him so hard that police were able to use blood left in the dog 's mouth to trace him			1
@entity8 , an 11 year - old rottweiler sank her teeth into the crook as he reached his hand through the cat flap at the home in @entity15 , @entity16			1
the usually mild - mannered pet did so much damage that police were able to take dna samples from blood left at the scene - including on @entity8 's teeth			1
bark off : @entity8 saw the burgler 's hand come through this cat flap and bit it to protect her home the attempted break - in happened at @entity31 ’s home last week while the family were away dealing with an emergency			1
a neighbour who was looking after the house found the back door covered in blood and called the family back			1
@entity31 , 53 , said : ' she ’s now a crime fighting dog			1
usually she ’s a very docile family pet			1
it ’s so out of character for @entity8			2
' she ’s a big softie and a lovable old girl			0
in dog years , she ’s an old pensioner			0
' a big softie ' : but @entity8 did what she had to do to protect the family home proud : @entity31 , daughter @entity49 and grandaughter @entity50 , 2 , with @entity8			2
the plastic cat flap has clearly been looked at by forensics and the hole has been boarded up ' she ’s as far from an aggressive dog as you could get			1
' @entity8 must have been threatened that night			0
she ’s used to the cats using the cat flap , so she must have heard something that spooked her			2
' when the neighbours rang to explain what happened i thought they were winding me up			0
' but when they told me forensic teams were in the kitchen i realised they were telling the truth			0
' there was blood smeared and splattered all over the door and the kitchen			0
' takes the biscuit : @entity8 , seen here with two - year - old @entity50 , is usually meek but was forced into action when a burglar threatened chilling out : the 11 - year - old rottweiler takes a break from being a ' crime - fighting dog ' the neighbours who were looking after the property that night turned the lights off and left the stairgate open – meaning @entity8 had the run of the house and the burglar had no idea she was there			1
the next morning when neighbours checked , they found the back door drenched in blood and called the @entity90			2
the attempted break - in happened somewhere between last thursday evening and 9.30am on friday			0
@entity8 ’s family were away from their home at the time dealing with a family emergency			0
daughter @entity49 , 25 , said : ' the burglar must have reached through the cat flap trying to reach the door handle			2
' because the lights were off he would n’t have seen @entity8 coming			0
' it looks like she grabbed hold of his arm and tried to pull him through			0
' proud : @entity8 's family admire her bravery when she took on the burglar and won last week fighting fit : a neighbour who was looking after the house while the @entity90 were away found the back door covered in blood thanks to @entity8 's intervention			1

@entity8 saw a hand come through the cat flap and bit it , which *allowed* police to *collect* dna
the attempted burglary was not *noticed* until blood was *spotted* all over the back door the next morning
