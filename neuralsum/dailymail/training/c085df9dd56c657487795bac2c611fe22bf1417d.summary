@entity0 scored his first goal of this @entity2 to help @entity3 reach the final for the second time in three years , despite an unconvincing display			1
neither @entity0 nor his new @entity7 team - mate @entity6 were at their best , against a @entity10 side that few teams expected to get even this far , but @entity0 ’s strike was still the highlight of an entertaining match			1
this has not been a great tournament for @entity7 ’s midfield powerhouse			0
sullen both on and off the pitch , rarely able to make an impression from a deeper role than he is used to , and possibly even carrying an injury , @entity0 had been a shadow of the player we know he can be			1
@entity0 ( right ) celebrates with team - mate @entity26 after rifling home to put @entity3 1 - 0 up @entity0 ( pictured wearing 19 ) runs along the side of the pitch with his team - mates in tow @entity32 restored @entity3 's lead to 2 - 1 five minutes before the half - time break in @entity35 , @entity36 @entity10 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 79 ) , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 69 ) , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 ( @entity51 61 ) subs not used : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 goal : @entity50 24 booked : @entity41 67 , @entity63 71 @entity3 ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity0 , @entity69 , @entity70 ( @entity71 72 ) , @entity72 ( @entity73 62 ) , @entity6 ( @entity74 90 +2 ) , @entity32 subs not used : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity81 - @entity80 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 goals : @entity0 20 , @entity32 41 , @entity86 68 booked : @entity86 26 , @entity0 28 , die 70 , @entity68 76 referee : @entity88 the frustration he showed to pick up a needless yellow card after just half an hour , by haranguing the referee over a throw - in decision , was typical of his tournament so far			1
on this occassion he was outshone by the excellent @entity95 of @entity96 , and while he was not exactly poor , he was nowhere near the all - action hero he should be for this team			2
unable to influence games as he might like , he has been reduced to merely a forceful personality , vociferously encouraging his team - mates , rather than a forceful performer , leading by example			2
but , in the 20th minute , he showed that he can still produce moments of magic			0
after @entity6 had been dispossessed in the box , the ball broke to @entity0 on the edge of the box			1
as it bounced across his body , the ball sat up perfectly for the 31 - year - old , and he seemed to let out three weeks of tension in the strike , which flew past veteran keeper @entity114 before he could do more than flap at it			2
the shot was not far from the 38 - year - old keeper , but it is hard to fault him for failing to save it			2
had he been able to react quickly enough to get a hand on it , it would have needed to be made of steel to divert the thunder - strike off target			2
@entity32 ( centre ) watches on as his shot flies past @entity114 and into the back of the @entity10 net @entity32 slides on his knees near the corner flag after helping his team to the @entity2 final @entity50 ( centre ) gave his side some hope after he equalised from the penalty spot to make it 1 - 1 the lead lasted just a few seconds			1
as has been their way all the way through this competition , the @entity10 forwards reacted to going behind – although in truth they had a helping hand from both @entity65 and referee @entity88			0
a hopeful ball into the box drifted over the head of @entity149 , and struck @entity65 on the hand , but quite how he was supposed to have deliberately handled from behind the striker is anyone ’s guess			0
nonetheless , @entity88 pointed to the spot and @entity155 calmly side - footed into the corner			1
but , once again , when finding themselves on level terms , @entity10 went back into their shell			0
eventually they were punished when @entity49 gifted the ball to @entity6 deep in his own half , the new @entity7 striker feeding @entity32 who finished with aplomb			1
@entity10 's players join @entity50 ( right ) to celebrate his equaliser from the penalty spot in the first half @entity171 's @entity49 ( right ) tries to take the ball past @entity3 's @entity68 during the match an @entity3 fan waves his country 's flag while he watches the semi-final match in @entity35 , @entity36 it had been coming			1
moments earlier @entity32 had a header cleared brilliantly off the line by @entity180 ’s @entity40 , who managed to turn the goal - bound effort up onto the underside of the crossbar and away			1
it was a feat the defender had to repeat in the second half , when @entity188 deflected a @entity32 cross towards his own goal			1
soon after the former @entity191 forward had another chance , running at goal from the right wing before being denied by a brilliant recovery tackle from @entity196			0
the third goal , which killed the game off , came from a corner , @entity26 ’s header parried into the path of @entity86 , who steered it home with a knee			0
it was harsh on @entity10 , who had dominated for much of the game			0
@entity40 ( right ) takes hold of the ball as @entity32 watches on during the @entity2 match @entity49 ( left ) looks up as goalscorer @entity86 bears down on him during their semi-final clash @entity50 ( right ) , scorer of @entity10 's goal , challenges @entity86 with a high foot in @entity35 despite the quality of the attacking players at his disposal , @entity3 coach @entity213 was once again content to allow the opposition possession for long periods , sitting his two defensive lines deep and utilizing the pace of @entity32 and @entity72 on the break			1
the @entity222 showed a little more ambition than in their quarter - final , with wing - backs @entity26 and @entity70 playing higher up the field than they had for large periods against @entity228 , but for the most part they were solid rather than spectacular			2
in fact , aside from @entity32 , @entity26 was the @entity222 best attacking outlet for much of the game from right wing - back , forcing @entity49 to do rather more tracking back than he is used to			1
but the @entity171 man still managed to find some time to attack , as @entity10 maintained plenty of possession and , once they had conceded the first goal , began to create some chances			0
new @entity7 man @entity6 ( left ) challenges @entity40 with a header as @entity3 progressed the @entity3 starting @entity242 line up and link arms as their national anthem plays in the build - up to the match @entity10 's starting @entity242 pose for a photo before their @entity2 semi-final match @entity49 provided first half chances for both @entity50 and @entity48 , the former seeing his deflected shot turned away by @entity64 , the latter stopped only by a brilliant challenge from @entity255 ’s @entity66			1
the winger continued to threaten in the second period , forcing @entity64 into two good saves early in the second half			0
the first came after @entity49 had controlled a cross and smashed it at goal , the second followed a brilliant jinking run , which , had he been able to finish , would have been goal of the tournament			0
but with @entity270 ’s goal the @entity268 ’ play went from merely attacking to suicidal , as multiple substitutions robbed them of any structure they had possessed in the final third			0
more than ever the @entity222 were able to sit deep , and their solidity told , the @entity268 scarcely able to muster a shot in the closing stages , while @entity32 should have added a fourth on the break			2
they will go into the final , against either @entity282 or hosts @entity36 , as strong favourites			0
rather like their captain ’s performance , this is not a vintage side , but it might well prove to be enough			0
despite the ‘ golden generation ’ seemingly being well past their best , they are on the verge of finally winning a major tournament .			0

@entity0 opened the scoring for @entity3 with a long - range effort
@entity50 equalised from the penalty spot shortly after
@entity32 restored @entity3 's lead five minutes before half - time
their place in the final was *confirmed* when @entity304 fired home
