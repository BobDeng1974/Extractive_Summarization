they have been protesting about ' corporate greed ' outside @entity2 for weeks with an apparent goal to destroy capitalism			1
but it seems the @entity7 camp in the heart of the capital 's financial district is having trouble controlling its own financial affairs			1
this week some demonstrators were accused of becoming ' elitist ' with too much power over the group amid accusations of the misuse of funds			1
allegations : some demonstrators were accused of becoming ' elitist ' with too much power over the group amid accusations of the misuse of funds claims : some activists ( none pictured ) apparently regard themselves as ' more equal than others ' and have been compared to the ruling elite satirised in @entity29 's famous @entity28 some were said to regard themselves as ' more equal than others ' and have been compared to the ruling elite satirised in @entity29 's famous @entity28			1
the allegations emerged as the demonstrators met for a meeting in @entity36 on tuesday but argued about their pot of money and how and when it should be spent , the @entity32 said			1
it led to rising tensions and members of the finance committee stepping down			1
one member , 25 - year - old @entity43 from @entity44 was accused of using donations from the public to pay for flights to @entity44			1
she has vehemently denied the allegations as ' wild rumours ' and has vowed to stay and help form an interim committee			1
' some are more equal than others ' : @entity28 was a satirical account of the @entity53 and the @entity55 regime an anonymous source told the newspaper two main leaders in their 40s and 50s and three people in their 20s were controlling the group and a charter had been drawn up giving power to very few people			1
@entity28 by @entity29 was published in @entity66 on 17 august 1945			2
@entity29 , a democratic socialist , retells the story of the emergence and development of @entity71 communism up to and during the @entity73 era before @entity74 in the book the animals overthrow their human oppressors and establish a socialist state called @entity28 which eventually collapses			2
the pigs , being the most intelligent animals in the group , take control of the planning and government of the farm and then declare themselves the decision - makers			2
over the years they become more and more like humans			2
eventually , the seven principles of @entity90 , known as the @entity91 and inscribed on the side of the barn , become reduced to a single principle reading ' all animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others			2
' she said : ' we are calling it the @entity28 manifesto			0
the are always smartly dressed			0
i do n't know how they manage it when we are all camping and they go off and have their secret meetings in @entity36			0
in addition , she claimed : ' a small number have decided they are more equal and are controlling the rest of us			0
' the source alleged the group had Â£ 21,000 in public donations two weeks ago but the leaders , who she said could sometimes be ' aggressive ' , had apparently said there was no more money for the food or ' tranquility ' tent - in charge of welfare - and the legal team were banned from using taxis or buying stationery			1
she demanded to know where the ' missing ' money had gone and said people were starting to leave as there was n't enough food			0
in @entity29 's 1945 novel , based on the @entity53 , the animals of @entity134 overthrow the dictator farmer mr @entity136 to establish a new regime based on communism			0
but the system fails as some of the animals become ruthless dictators declaring that ' all animals are equal but some are more equal than others '			0
the anti-capitalist protest at the @entity2 is part of a series in cities across the globe which aim to highlight the inequalities caused by mismanagement of the economy			0
power : an anonymous source said two main leaders and three people in their 20s were controlling the group and a charter had been drawn up giving power to very few people demonstrators have been camped outside @entity2 's since october 15 after an attempt to occupy the nearby @entity165 failed			1
the @entity7 group say its aim is : ' a future free from austerity , growing inequality , unemployment , tax injustice and a political elite who ignores its citizens , and work towards concrete demands to be met			0
' last month they took over an empty office building owned by investment bank @entity178			0
it was the latest act of defiance from the group who said they would legally challenge 24 - hour eviction legal notices pinned to their tents outside the @entity2			0
the camp 's presence has led to a humiliating internal row within the church which led to two high profile resignations .			0
