exhausted and losing weight , @entity0 put her symptoms down to the stress of giving birth just five months earlier			1
tragically , she had no idea they were a sign of undiagnosed diabetes which cost the 26 - year - old her life			2
miss @entity13 died after being found unconscious at home by her fiance			0
an inquest later heard the mother - of - one had suffered from type 1 diabetes , which had led to her oesophagus gradually deteriorating			1

her fiance said that when he took her to a doctor , she was simply prescribed iron tablets			0
the coroner concluded that she died of diabetic ketoacidosis , which can occur when people with diabetes do not get the insulin they need			2
consistently high blood glucose levels can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis ( @entity52 )			0
this happens when a severe lack of insulin means the body can not use glucose for energy , and the body starts to break down other body tissue as an alternative energy source			2
ketones are the by - product of this process			0

mr @entity81 said : ‘ @entity0 was n’t feeling great and insisted i go and enjoy myself			1
