by @entity0 published : 11:53 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 12:14 est , 20 june 2013 a quarter of patients who 've had a heart attack or stroke will suffer from @entity5 within a year nearly one in four patients who suffer a stroke or heart attack go on to experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder , a study has found			1
previously thought of as a condition which only affected soldiers or victims of traumatic events such as assualt , the research shows @entity5 is much more far reaching			2
the findings suggest that nearly 300,000 survivors of strokes or heart attacks will develop symptoms of @entity5 as a result of their health scare every year in the @entity25 alone			0
the research , carried out by @entity27 , also found suffering from ptsd also doubles a patient 's chance of future heart attack and of death within three years			1
@entity32 , assistant professor of behavioral medicine at @entity34 , said : ' ptsd is common among heart attack survivors and it contributes to a doubled risk of a future cardiac event or of dying within one to three years			2
' our current results show that @entity5 in stroke and @entity43 [ heart attack ] survivors may increase their risk for recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular events			1
' given that each event is life - threatening and that strokes / @entity49 add hundreds of millions of dollars to annual health expenditures , these findings are important to both the long - term survival and health costs of these patient populations			0
' @entity5 is an anxiety disorder caused by exposure to a traumatic event			1
common symptoms include nightmares , avoidance of reminders of the event , and elevated heart rate and blood pressure			1
chronic ptsd is when these symptoms persist for three months or longer			0
researchers at @entity34 believe this study , on 1,138 stroke or heart attack survivors , is the first time research has been carried out into ptsd caused by strokes or heart attacks			2
findings : @entity5 has previously been primarily associated with soldiers or victims of traumatic events but new research by @entity78 has highlighted that many victims of stroke go on to suffer the disorder according to data from the @entity83 , nearly 795,000 suffer a new or recurrent stroke in the @entity25 every year with a further 500,000 suffering a heart attack			1
the study shows that around 23 per cent of sufferers will go on to develop ptsd symptoms within a year of their stroke or heart attack , with one in nine suffering chronic ptsd more than a year on			2
@entity92 , assistant professor of medicine at @entity34 , said : ' ptsd is not just a disorder of combat veterans and sexual assault survivors , but strongly affects survivors of stroke and other potentially traumatic acute cardiovascular events as well			0
' ptsd and other psychological disorders in stroke and @entity43 patients appear to be an under - recognized and undertreated problem			0
' surviving a life - threatening health scare can have a debilitating psychological impact , and health care providers should make it a priority to screen for symptoms of depression , anxiety , and ptsd among these patient populations			0
' the study was published in the online edition of @entity116 .			0

@entity5 is an anxiety disorder caused by traumatic events and is common in soldiers and victims of assault and rape
symptoms include nightmares , elevated heart rate and blood pressure
*scientists* also found that suffering with @entity5 doubles a patients ' risk of death within three years of surviving a stroke or heart attack
