by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 were given a boost on saturday when it was confirmed that @entity4 should be fit to play in the @entity5 and that his @entity7 team - mate @entity6 will be in peak condition for @entity9			1
manager @entity10 names his squad on monday and it was feared @entity4 would be unavailable after injuring his left shoulder in @entity7 ’s win over @entity14 on tuesday			1
however , the defender has suffered only bruising and minor ligament damage , and @entity7 ’s interim boss @entity17 expects him to be fit in time , even though he will miss the club ’s final game of the season at @entity21 tomorrow			1
‘ he ’s obviously out for @entity21 but should be ok for the @entity5			1
we are still monitoring it but it does n’t look too bad			0
’ @entity6 will also miss the trip to @entity30 ’s , meaning he will have failed to play in @entity7 ’s last three games of the season after aggravating a groin injury in training last week			1
it has inevitably raised concerns over the fitness of @entity2 ’s talisman , but @entity17 believes @entity6 will benefit from the break after going into the last two @entity40 struggling with injury			1
‘ sunday probably will be a bit too soon for @entity6 but he ’ll train and be fine for the @entity5 , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ he has had a fantastic season and i think he is ready to make an impact			0
the injury was just a little groin strain but he ’s fine			0
‘ he has done all the work in the gym , he trained yesterday and he ’s going away next week to work on his fitness as well so the injury has probably done him a favour			2
he will be going into it relatively fresh			0
’ lucky break ! @entity4 ' injury is not as bad as first feared , although he will not appear in @entity7 's final game asked if this will be @entity6 ’s last chance to make an impact on a @entity5 , at the age of 28 , @entity17 said : ‘ yes i think it is			1
@entity6 is a top player and i think he is at a good age and at the peak of his powers			1
‘ i know he can not wait for it			0
it ’s exciting , a @entity5 in @entity9			2
we have all watched @entity9 teams over the years so to play in a @entity5 in @entity9 is something i wish i had the pleasure of doing			2
’ tomorrow sees @entity17 ’s last game in charge as @entity7 prepare to appoint @entity72 next week			1
they need to beat @entity21 and for @entity73 to lose at home to @entity75 to clinch sixth place and qualify for the @entity77			2
up in the air : @entity17 ' future at @entity80 will be decided by the next boss , expected to be @entity72 @entity17 ’ future remains uncertain , both in terms of prolonging his playing career at the age of 40 and joining @entity87 ’s backroom team			1
he indicated on friday that he would like to play on after extending his appearance record to 963 on tuesday , but said the decision will rest with the new manager			0
‘ i loved it the other night coming on , ’ he said			0
‘ i still enjoy training , even though i have n’t done much of it over the last couple of weeks			0
‘ i think it will be difficult to stop playing			0
it ’s probably easier when you ’ve had injury problems but i ’ve never really had those			0
’ meanwhile , @entity2 doctors have visited @entity73 to assess full - back @entity101 ’s fitness			2
‘ he has not trained at all , ’ said @entity73 boss @entity103			0
‘ i suppose @entity10 is going to see if he wants to give @entity101 time to get himself ready			0

@entity2 pair @entity6 and @entity4 are expected to return from injury in time for the @entity5
@entity4 ' shoulder injury is not as bad as first feared , says @entity17
neither will play in @entity7 's final game of the season against @entity21 - but lay - off could do @entity6 ' a favour ' , *claims* @entity17
@entity117 's future as player and coach will be decided by @entity7 's next manager , *widely* expected to be @entity72
