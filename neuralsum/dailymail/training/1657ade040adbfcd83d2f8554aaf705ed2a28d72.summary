on a visit to @entity23 last week , the pm was filmed boasting to former mayor @entity24 about the call he made to the @entity1 at @entity26			1
as the prime minister and mr @entity24 arrived for a press photo - opportunity , mr @entity0 smiled broadly as he recalled how he was able to tell the @entity1 it was ' all right ' after the referendum resulted in a victory for the no camp			1
' the definition of relief , if you are prime minister of the @entity36 , is ringing up @entity1 and saying ' your majesty , it is all right , it 's okay ' , ' mr @entity0 said			1
she purred down the line			2
' today mr @entity0 vowed ' never again ' to discuss his conversations with the @entity1 after being challenged whether he was ashamed to have been overheard saying she had ' purred ' when told the result of the @entity2 independence referendum			1
he told @entity48 's @entity47 show : ' ( it is ) one of those moments when you look back and kick yourself very hard			2
' it was not a conversation i should have had , i am extremely sorry and very embarrassed about it			2
' i have made my apologies and i think i 'll probably be making some more			2
' in an extraordinary sequence , @entity0 was today heard talking about the moment he rang the @entity1 at @entity26 to give her the news about the vote despite being just feet from the cameras , mr @entity0 appears to have had no qualms about being so indiscreet about his private discussions with the head of state in the video recording , @entity0 can clearly be heard discussing his private conversations with the @entity1			1
he said : ' the definition of relief is being the prime minister of the @entity36 and ringing the @entity1 and saying ' it 's alright , it 's okay '			1
' she purred down the line ... ' but it should never have been that close			0
' it was n't in the end , but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt â€¦ ' i 've said i want to find these polling companies and i want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through			0
' it was very nervous moments			0
' asked if he felt ashamed , the prime minister added : ' i 'm very sorry about it ... i 'm not going to ever discuss my conversations with the @entity96 ever again			1
' @entity97 has already contacted @entity96 to offer the prime minister 's apologies and it is understood that mr @entity0 will say sorry in person when he next meets her majesty for one of his regular audiences			1
after a bitter two - year campaign , 55 per cent of people in @entity2 voted to remain part of the @entity36			0
it mean that first minister @entity108 resigned , announcing hours after the result was declared that he would be stepping down in november			1
in the run - up to the vote mr @entity0 repeatedly denied he would not resign if voters backed independence , insisting they should not use the result as a chance to ' give the effing @entity116 a kick '			2
however , in an interview on the eve of the @entity121 party conference in @entity122 , mr @entity0 revealed he did have doubts about whether he could remain in office if he was the pm who oversaw the break - up of the @entity36			2
he told the @entity126 on sunday , said he would have been ' heartbroken ' by the break - up of the @entity36 and first considered his position when polls put the @entity6 campaign ahead just days before the referendum			0

if the vote had been for @entity2 to have left the @entity36 , i genuinely would have been heartbroken			0
i would have felt winded and wounded			0
' emotionally , one would have thought , ' i 'm so saddened by this			0
i find it difficult to go on '			0
' ' of course , i contemplated having to go			0
i thought , ' what 's the right thing to do ? ' in many ways the easiest thing would be to say , ' i feel wounded by this ' and walk away			0
i 'm sure it would have been absolutely awful			0
' in the end i came to the conclusion that would not have been the right thing to do			0
since the referendum he has faced calls to honour pledges for more devolution to @entity2 and also consider allowing only @entity161 @entity160 to vote on @entity161 legislation .			0
