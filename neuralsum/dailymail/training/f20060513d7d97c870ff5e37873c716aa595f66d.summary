by @entity0 published : 00:14 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 08:28 est , 20 september 2012 it is the kind of civilised al - fresco dining you ’d normally associate with an upmarket @entity5 cafe			1
but these @entity7 workers in @entity8 defied expectations when , instead of eating a standard lunch of sandwiches with a cup of tea , they sat down to enjoy a hot meal and glass of red wine			2
every day @entity17 , 49 , and @entity18 , 58 , who have worked together for the past eight years , will cook lunch from scratch using the little gas cooker in the back of their van			1
tucking in : @entity17 , centre , along with colleagues @entity27 and @entity18 , enjoy a freshly - cooked meal on their lunchbreak during another @entity7 job in @entity32 's @entity8 eating properly : the trio shun sandwiches and mugs of tea in favour of a sit down meal and a glass of red this week they have been unfurling their gingham table cloths and laying out their plates , metal cutlery and wine glasses to enjoy what they describe as a ‘ civilised lunch ’ at @entity8 in @entity49 - famous for its posh tailors and bespoke suits			2
the pair have a selection of herbs and spices at the ready and stop off at the market on the way to work to pick up fresh ingredients – rustling up anything from @entity61 pasta dishes to fish with vegetables			1
and the sophistication does n’t end there			2
mr @entity17 , who has a fondness for anything retro and enjoys dancing , insists on playing 1920s music , jazz and classical throughout the day to create a ‘ pleasant ambience ’ and has decorated the van with quirky artefacts			1
dining in style : the three men have worked together for years and take it in turns to try out culinary creations on each other during their breaks making a meal of things : the trio like to eat in different places and enjoy ' putting a smile on people 's faces '			2
meat the chef : @entity18 prepares mince for his spaghetti bolognese mr @entity17 , who works at different venues across @entity32 with mr @entity18 in their job as @entity7 engineers , said : ‘ we spend most of our nine - hour day working underground so it makes us feel a bit more human to clean ourselves up before our lunch break and enjoy a proper meal			0
‘ after all it ’s cheaper and fresher and we go back to the job with a clearer head			1
it ’s just how we cook at home			0
my signature dish is chorizo pesto pasta with rocket salad and parmesan shavings			1
’ he added : ‘ we both have an appreciation for the finer things in life			0
and passers - by always enjoy it too			0
’ this week 's menu has included @entity116 green curry , washed down with red wine , and spaghetti bolognese with a baguette			1
stirring it : @entity18 makes sure his pasta does n't boil over coq au van ? @entity18 serves up food in the back of the @entity7 truck chef : mr @entity127 cooks up spaghetti bolognese ( left ) and then tucks in as @entity17 sits at his table ( right ) dinner is served : the food is plated up - with shavings of parmesan cheese - beside the engineer 's equipment sometimes the men enjoy a beer with lunch but , this week they decided to go with wine as one of them has a ' well - stocked wine cellar '			1
the men have been repairing telephone lines in upmarket @entity8 but say they do not have a favourite spot to dine , having eaten their fresh roadside meals all over the capital			0
mr @entity17 said : ' we like @entity149 because it has a great vibe and it ’s the sort of place you ’d go to eat out , but we like different places			0
' we would n’t want to eat in the same place all the time because people would get used to seeing us			0
we enjoy putting a smile on people ’s faces			0
' table for one : a passer - by ca n't believe his eyes when he notices the @entity7 crew having lunch can i have some ? @entity17 's antics bring a smile to the face of this pedestrian			0
