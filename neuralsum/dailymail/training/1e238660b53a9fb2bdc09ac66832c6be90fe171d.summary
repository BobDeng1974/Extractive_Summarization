by @entity0 published : 10:30 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 05:59 est , 6 july 2013 scientists believe our galaxy could contain a staggering 60 billion planets that might be capable of supporting life			0
based on data from @entity9 's @entity8 spacecraft , scientists had predicted there should be one @entity12 - size planet in the habitable zone of each red dwarf , the most common type of star			1
but a group of researchers has now doubled that estimate after considering how cloud cover might help an alien planet support life			1
cloud cover is crucial for life , as clouds not only reflect sunlight to cool things off - they keep the planet warm enough to sustain life			1
new findings from the @entity38 and @entity39 show that planets orbiting red dwarf stars are more likely to be habitable than previously believed a new study by the @entity38 and @entity39 said that the @entity43 alone could contain 60 billion planets orbiting red dwarf stars that could support life			1
it also suggests new ways for astronomers to test whether planets orbiting red dwarfs have cloud cover			2
the researchers based their study , which appeared in @entity55 , on rigorous computer simulations of cloud behaviour on alien planets			2
this cloud behaviour dramatically expanded the estimated habitable zone of red dwarfs , which are much smaller and fainter than stars like the sun. @entity63 , assistant professor in geophysical sciences at the @entity38 , said : ' clouds cause warming and they cause cooling on @entity12			1
' they reflect sunlight to cool things off and they absorb infrared radiation from the surface to make a greenhouse effect			0
' that 's part of what keeps the planet warm enough to sustain life			0
' the planets believed capable of supporting life fall in habitable zones where they are the right temperature to be able to have liquid water on their surfaces - a requirement of life as we know it			1
as red dwarf stars are slightly cooler and less bright than our sun , the planets are usually closer to their star			2

planetary scientists at @entity38 and @entity39 are applying global climate simulations to problems in astronomy @entity102 , another author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow at @entity39 , said : ' if you 're orbiting around a low mass or dwarf star , you have to orbit about once a month or once every two months to receive the same amount of sunlight that we receive from the sun. ' as the orbit of these habitable planets around a red dwarf is tight , they are tidally locked , so that one side of the planet always faces the star			1
therefore anything living on one of these planets would enjoy continual daylight			0
the researchers used 3d simulations to model how air would move over a planet tidally locked with a dwarf star			2
mr @entity102 said : ' there ’s no way you can do clouds properly in one dimension			0
' but in a three dimensional model , you ’re actually simulating the way air moves and the way moisture moves through the entire atmosphere of the planet			0
' they found that if water was found on the surface of a planet it would result in clouds			0
these clouds would gather on the star - facing side of the planet where it is always noon			0
their position would have a cooling effect on the inner ring of the habitable zone , enabling the planets to have water on their surfaces , even though they are much closer to their red dwarfs than the @entity12 is to the sun. clouds exert a major influence on @entity12 's climate			1
if clouds only cooled the planet by reflecting solar energy back to space , @entity12 ( pictured ) would completely ice over			0
but if clouds only warmed the planet by absorbing and reemitting infrared energy back to the surface , @entity12 would fry under a runaway greenhouse effect like the one on @entity173 the scientists believe that their findings could prove a new way to confirm the presence of liquid water on the surface of alien planets using the @entity181			1
the new space observatory is scheduled for launch in 2018			0
mr @entity102 said : ' if you look at @entity186 or @entity187 with an infrared telescope from space , it can look cold and that 's because you 're seeing the cloud deck ' he explained that the as the cloud deck is at high altitude it is extremely cold and the same could be true of a habitable planet with a highly reflective cloud cover			2
the researchers said that if the telescope detects a similar cold signal over the star - facing side of an alien planet , it is ' almost definitely from clouds			2
' ' it 's a confirmation that you do have surface liquid water			0

based on data from @entity9 's @entity8 spacecraft , scientists had predicted there should be one @entity12 - size planet in the habitable zone of each red dwarf star
but researchers at the @entity38 have doubled that estimate after considering how cloud cover might help an alien planet support life
scientists found that if water was found on the surface of a planet it would result in clouds that could have a cooling effect no the planet
findings could prove a new way to confirm the presence of liquid water on the surface of alien planets
