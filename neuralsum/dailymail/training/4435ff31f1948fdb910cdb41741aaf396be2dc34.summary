by @entity0 , @entity1 last updated at 11:44 am on 23rd february 2012 nearly half of pilots say they have fallen asleep at the controls , it emerged yesterday			1
the alarming admission came as union leaders warned @entity8 that even more passengers ’ lives will be put at risk due to new @entity13 rules that could allow pilots to land their aircraft after 22 hours without sleep			1
the change – to ‘ harmonise ’ flying hours – poses ‘ a danger to public safety ’ and must not be adopted by the @entity19 , the @entity20 warned the @entity21 yesterday			1
the pilots ' association , @entity26 , fears air passengers will be put at risk if changes to their working arrangements are agreed its research claims that the proposals will leave pilots ‘ drunk with fatigue ’ – as if they had consumed five cans of lager and were four times over the legal limit for flying			2
@entity26 ’s head of safety , dr @entity39 , told mps that its own poll showed 43 per cent of pilots had fallen asleep on the flight deck – but said this was ‘ probably an underestimation ’			2
asked if the @entity50 changes would lead to more accidents , dr @entity39 replied : ‘ i would say so			1
’ he added that competition among airlines was so intense it could lead to skimping on safety			0
‘ if airlines spend on safety today , they might go out of business tomorrow , ’ he said			0
@entity26 has said there are no guarantees that mandated rest time for pilots will mean they will get sleep the pilots ’ union is concerned that the @entity66 appears to be supporting the flying time rules from the @entity50 ’s @entity68 when it should be demanding an opt - out			1
before the meeting , @entity26 general secretary @entity70 said : ‘ the government have to answer this question : “ is it safe to land an aircraft after 22 hours [ without sleep ] ? ” if not , they need to reject these @entity50 proposals now and keep the current @entity19 rules in place until they have been significantly improved			1
’ @entity81 was seen as factor in the crash which killed 49 people in @entity85 , @entity86 , in the @entity87 three years ago			0
it emerged the co-pilot was paid a salary so low that she lived with her parents near @entity92 and commuted across the country to her job , a combination of long travel and little money that a safety official called a " recipe for an accident "			0
a @entity102 hearing then focused on whether captain @entity103 and co-pilot @entity104 were fatigued on the wintry night of february 12 , 2009 , when they apparently made a series of critical errors as @entity108 approached @entity109			0
the @entity110 , a twin - engine turboprop , experienced an aerodynamic stall , rolling back and forth before plunging into a house below			0
all 49 people aboard and one on the ground were killed in the worst @entity87 air crash in seven years			0
mr @entity70 added : ‘ twenty hours of wakefulness is far from the only part of the proposals which give us serious concern			2
‘ compared with the @entity19 ’s domestic rules , the @entity50 proposals would see pilots being able to fly further – as far as @entity126 – with no back - up crew and , contrary to scientific advice , allow pilots to do up to seven early starts in a row , which is desperately fatiguing			1
‘ we need the government to say it wo n’t support this danger to public safety , and will demand that we either get the proposals to a much safer position , or retain our own domestic rules			0
’ @entity138 , of the @entity140 union , said the proposals would lead to a 17 per cent increase in pilots ’ workloads			2
and there is a five - and - a - half times higher chance of an accident when duty periods exceed 13 hours , according to @entity149 , executive board director of the @entity150			2
but the @entity66 rejected any suggestion that the controversial @entity50 rules would compromise safety			1
captain @entity154 , of @entity155 , insisted airlines were not prioritising profits and that safety was the responsibility of the airline and the captain flying on that particular day			0
aviation minister @entity162 claimed there would be ‘ significant safety gains ’ from the @entity13 proposals			0
she said the @entity50 plans would ‘ broadly ’ bring the whole of the continent up to @entity19 levels and would not see a ‘ levelling down ’ of standards .			1

pilots fear new @entity50 regulations would allow them to land a plane after up to 22 hours without sleep
