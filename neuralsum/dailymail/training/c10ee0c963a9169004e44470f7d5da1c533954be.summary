by @entity0 published : 18:35 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 03:34 est , 28 march 2012 radical preacher : unlike @entity3 , @entity2 has dithered over deporting @entity4 because of a judgement blocking the move by the @entity7 for years , successive governments have insisted that extremist preacher @entity4 can not be kicked out of @entity2 , claiming it would breach his human rights			1
perhaps we should have looked to @entity3 as an example			2
yesterday the @entity7 admitted it is effectively powerless to intervene in the case of a convicted terrorist deported from @entity3			1
although the @entity16 court ordered that compensation be paid to @entity18 , who was sent home to @entity20 in 2010 in breach of a court order , officials said they are unable to force @entity3 to take him back			1
a spokesman said : ‘ once the applicant has been deported there is nothing much we can do because he is in @entity20 , a country that is not part of the @entity7			1
’ last night , the ruling prompted calls for ministers to follow @entity3 ’s example and deport @entity35			1
the government has argued the radical @entity37 – described by a judge as @entity40 ’s right hand man in @entity41 – can not be removed to his home country of @entity43 because of an @entity7 judgment			2
the court ’s judges said @entity35 could not hope to receive a fair trial there because it would likely be based on evidence obtained by torture			0
but @entity51 , @entity52 mp for @entity53 and @entity54 , said : ‘ the @entity3 and @entity56 governments have a track record of ignoring @entity16 in deportation cases where there is a risk of torture with precious little consequence			1
flawed ruling : conservative mp @entity51 ( above ) says @entity2 should send @entity35 back to @entity43 immediately ‘ in the @entity35 case , @entity16 went well beyond existing human rights law			2
having bent over backwards to accommodate this flawed ruling , we now need to put him on a flight to @entity43 without delay			0
’ @entity18 was jailed for five years and four months in october 2006 after he and two other men , thought to be linked to radical group @entity70 , were convicted of terror charges			0
in negotiations : but home secretary @entity73 has repeatedly refused to say if she will defy @entity16 's judges police said the cell planned attacks in @entity3 and brainwashed recruits to act as suicide bombers			2
after @entity18 ’s conviction , the @entity81 court said he should be deported at the end of his sentence			0
however , the @entity7 ordered @entity3 to block the deportation while it considered if sending him home would breach his human rights			1
despite this order , within months of finishing his sentence in february 2010 , @entity18 had been put on a plane back to @entity20			2
yesterday the @entity7 criticised the @entity3 government for ignoring its earlier ruling and ordered it to pay @entity93 15,000 euros ( £ 12,500 ) plus expenses			1
the @entity95 has also written to the @entity3 government , saying it is ‘ deeply concerned ’ by its actions			0
@entity3 took similar steps in june 2008 when it ignored a court ruling and sent convicted terrorist @entity99 back to @entity20			1
the home secretary is currently negotiating with the @entity43 government to get assurances that @entity35 would be given a fair trial			0
last week @entity73 refused five times in an interview to say whether she would defy @entity16 judges and return the hate preacher			0
however , she insisted she wanted to find a way to deport @entity35 so the government was ‘ not required by any court ’ to take him back			0
a @entity113 official last night pointed out that while @entity18 had been deported as his case was still pending , a final judgment had been made with regards to @entity35			0
government lawyers fear that any attempt at removing him would therefore be in contempt of court .			0

we ca *n't* reverse @entity3 's deportation of terrorist to @entity20 , admits @entity7
@entity52 mp leads calls for @entity2 to follow suit with hate *cleric* @entity4
