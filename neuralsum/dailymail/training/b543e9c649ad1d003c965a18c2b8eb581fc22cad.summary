by @entity0 published : 17:35 est , 3 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:54 est , 3 february 2014 one manager after another telephoned @entity5 over the weekend and told him he ’d be mad to accept being reinstated as boss of @entity7			1
they were trying to put him off but it seems to have had the opposite effect			2
if he really is going crackers , where better to pitch up than the madhouse that is @entity13 ? @entity5 clearly saw it that way and had no hesitation picking up where he left off last friday night , when a call to his home from a lawyer representing would - be owner @entity21 precipitated the most shambolic 72 hours in the club ’s history			1
less than 24 hours later , he was back in work and barely 48 hours after that he appeared at a training - ground press conference yesterday to announce he was still the manager - but might not be by the weekend			1
‘ one or two said i should give it another go but a lot of important people advised strongly against it , ’ said @entity5 yesterday			1
‘ but i was so proud of the response from everyone on saturday , i had to come back			2
‘ the fans showed they are a class act , the players did and so did ( assistant ) @entity38 , with the way he ran things in my absence			1
' it has been very difficult for me - something that should never happen to any manager and hopefully never will again - but i could not walk away from these people			2
stress : @entity5 put on a brave face during his monday morning press conference ‘ i sat there at home on saturday afternoon watching the scores come up and i did wonder what the future might hold			1
' but when i got that call from the lawyer on friday , i imagined he must be acting for mr @entity21 and he was the one giving me the bullet			1
with that in mind , i thought all along it was very odd			2
’ oh , and among all the toing and froing , @entity5 ’s squad acquired a new signing , but he has no idea who he is or which club he ’s from			1
and even less of an idea how the owner ’s treatment of him will pan out			2
he added : ‘ you have to be the owner of a club to bring new players in , so you surely have to be the owner to sack the manager			2
‘ it was very strange , to say the least			2
but questions like “ can i work with him if he does take over ? ” and “ will i still be in charge for @entity79 next saturday ? ” are ones i just ca n’t answer			0
honestly , i have no idea			0
’ support : @entity5 claimed he wants to stay at @entity7 to repay support he has received from the fans this famous old venue has had its moments down the years , from @entity87 ’s well - fed fish to @entity88 taking his seat in the directors ’ box to chants of ‘ get out of our club ’			1
this , though , tops the lot			0
@entity21 was so confident his bid for a 75 per cent stake in @entity7 had been rubber - stamped by @entity99 that he ordered @entity5 ’s sacking on friday night , a move that caused uproar among fans who protested before , during and after the following day ’s remarkable 5 - 1 win over @entity105			1
such was the outpouring of support for @entity5 that owners @entity99 felt compelled to issue a statement in which they ‘ wished to make it clear that @entity5 remains first - team manager ’			1
the one constant of a bewildering three days at a club who were @entity115 semi-finalists little over a decade ago			0
protest : a @entity7 fan shows his discontent over a prospective sale of the club to @entity21 with @entity120 chairman @entity21 still eager to seize a controlling interest , if he passes the football @entity115 ’s fit - and - proper - persons test , who knows what the future holds for @entity5 ? he certainly does n’t			1
he was forced to concede as much after fronting up at @entity7 ’ @entity129 training ground and fielding questions on the chaos			1
his livelihood is at stake , yet there was still a ready smile and a willingness to laugh at the sheer absurdity of it all			0
after entering the room , taking his seat and waiting for the cameras to stop flashing , he was asked to recount the timeline since ‘ things went a little awry ’ last week			0
still in charge : @entity5 admitted people had told him to walk away from @entity7 ‘ a little awry ! ’ he said			1
‘ i ’m not sure i ’d describe it quite like that			0
i got a call on friday night to say i had been relieved of my duties and a letter was on its way to confirm it			0
‘ then on saturday morning , i got another call from @entity99 to say that was n’t the case			0
i then saw a couple of statements from the club on my @entity159 , and here i am now			0
i must say , i did n’t think , on friday night , i would be sitting before you all today			0
' and there are an awful lot of people who told me i should n’t be			0
‘ it ’s just great to be back			0
i walked into the changing room and some of the lads gave me a look and said , “ where have you been all weekend ? ” you ’ve got to laugh			0
’ unpopular : @entity21 is hoping to secure a 75 per cent takeover of @entity7 less likely to amuse @entity5 is interference , such as former @entity174 defender @entity173 being told he can join the coaches in the dug - out and midfielder @entity176 being recruited on loan from @entity120 behind his back			1
‘ i ’ve had assurances from the owners about certain things and , for me , no - one goes in the dug - out or the dressing room without the manager ’s ok , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity173 was at the training ground this morning but i ’ve only spoken to him once , when he first came over			0
' i do n’t know anything about the lad we are supposed to have signed and i ’m not sure the @entity115 have ratified it yet			0
if they do , he ’ll get an opportunity if we feel he is a player who can help us			0
’ as for the letter that was supposedly dispatched last friday , it has still to drop through @entity5 ’s front door			1
lost in the post , perhaps			0
it would n’t exactly be out of sync with the last few days , would it ? for the boss : @entity7 players celebrate during their 5 - 1 win against @entity105			1

@entity5 claims he is *n't* sure how long he will be kept as @entity206 manager
@entity5 wants to stay *due* to the support he *'s* received from @entity7 fans
@entity7 boss *reveals* a fellow manager *warned* him to leave @entity7
@entity21 wants 75 per cent takeover
