in 2010 @entity0 campaigned to have @entity2 posters put up in the area by @entity5 radicals removed a nun has torn down a black and white flag similar to one championed by @entity5 extremists from the gates of a @entity11 housing estate and branded those who hoisted it up as ' naive young hotheads '			1
the emblem was hung alongside the @entity17 flag in @entity18 , @entity19 , three days ago as part of a ' end the siege in @entity22 ' campaign			1
sister @entity24 , 77 , a nun who works at a nearby church , said she asked some friends to help take the flag down early this morning using a stepladder out of fear it could be seen as ' aggressive ' or ' insensitive '			1
anti-extremist campaigners said the raising of the black flag was a ' provocative ' act and undermined legitimate anger about the crisis in @entity37			1
defence secretary @entity38 called it ' extremely inappropriate '			2
but the @entity41 nun , who has worked helping the elderly in the area for the last 40 years , denied the flag was put up to show support for radical jihadists			1
speaking yards from the gate today outside @entity49 , she insisted there was not any anti-semitic sentiment on the estate and said the ' issue has been taken out of proportion			1
' ' there 's no way they would have thought it was to do with @entity58 , ' she said			2
' i could n't believe it had been up for two weeks			2
i believe it means ' there is no other @entity63 but @entity64			2
' the problem is that it has been adopted by @entity58			2
' it 's as ridiculous as saying the @entity67 is a symbol of the @entity69			0
' it 's exactly like with the @entity71 and the @entity69 supporters			0
it 's nothing to do with being @entity74			0
they 're just young hot heads , naive			0
' i 'm @entity76 and its as ridiculous as saying that i represent the @entity78			0
' @entity0 , who in 2010 campaigned to have @entity2 posters put up in the area by @entity5 radicals removed , continued : ' the issue is aggression and insensitivity			1
it could be seen to be aggressive			0
' i 'm not sure that if i put up a @entity88 flag it would n't be upsetting to some people			1
' it is not clear who raised the flag on the @entity97 - named after the noted victorian - era anti-poverty campaigner and then @entity96 mp - but it has caused offence			1
the black and white flag has the @entity110 - the declaration of faith that all @entity113 say - written on it , which translates as ' there is no god but @entity63 , @entity117 is the messenger of @entity63 '			1
but in recent years versions have been hijacked by extremist supporters of the @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity58			1
a local resident , @entity124 , 57 , said : ' they 're young boys who dont know what they 're doing			0
they have hot blood and they 're playing with fire			0
' one man who objected to it says he was confronted by a gang of youths who asked him : ' are you a jew ? '			0
when he said : ' would it make a difference ? ' they responded : ' yes it f * * * * * * would ' , according to the @entity142			0
patrol : police have been walking the @entity97 to calm any tensions			0
it is not clear who raised the flag on the @entity97 - named after the noted victorian - era anti-poverty campaigner and then @entity96 mp - but it has caused offence gone : the local council today visited to remove the black flag hoisted above this @entity17 flag , but it was already gone - taken down by @entity0 mystery : a gang of youths are said to have confronted someone who complained about the flag and asked him : ' are you a jew ? ' as news spread across the estate , @entity5 men spilling out of a nearby mosque rounded on reporters as they spoke to residents about their view on the inflammatory gesture			1
the group 's anger was directed at reports that terrorist - sympathisers had raised the flag similar in style to that used by terror group @entity58 alongside @entity17 flags			1
the five journalists said they were threatened by some in the group of @entity185 men aged between late teens and early forties			0
snatching one reporter 's notepad a man who had a young boy with him said : ' you better leave here before we do something to you			0
go now , we do n't want you around here			0
' two locals stepped in to calm the men down and one said : ' the people who caused these problems will be explaining themselves			0
' it has caused us a lot of trouble , it has made us all look like violent terrorists			0
' but the message on that flag and another here now are very similar , they just look different			1
' they are just @entity210 slogans that are used by all @entity113 in praise of @entity64			1
' speaking outside his flat where a large @entity17 flag hung from a bamboo cane student @entity217 , 25 , said : ' i 'm protesting for @entity22 , they 're humans not animals			1
' all the people here support @entity22			0
@entity5 and @entity88 are a family on this estate , we are protesting against @entity226			1
' some people call it a jihadi flag or a terrorism flag			1
it 's not , it 's just a sign of @entity210			0
it says there is no god but @entity64			0
@entity5 @entity237 , 44 , lives with his wife and five children on the estate			2
the shop worker said : ' until now there has never been a show of any anger , but i think it has been below the surface			0
' there is a big @entity5 community here , who are all angry about what is happening in @entity22			0
i 'm happy to support that			0
' but putting up a flag could cause us trouble , it will give @entity256 a bad reputation			2
' it might cause trouble between people here on the estate or it will encourage bad people to come here from somewhere else ' this is generally a safe place for them , we do n't want extreme people talking to our kids '			2
controversial : @entity19 mayor @entity268 raised the @entity17 flag outside his headquarters but @entity272 leaders told him to concentrate on ' potholes and bins ' counter-terrorism think tank the @entity276 has called the decision to raise the flag ' provocative ' and ' worrying '			1
a spokesman said : ' this is not the flag of the so - called @entity283 ( formerly @entity58 ) , but the black flag with the shahadatayn ( @entity5 declarations of faith ) written in white is known as the rayah , a symbol that has been adopted by @entity210 in the last 25 years			1
since the @entity293 conflict , it has been increasingly adopted by jihadist organisations			0
' it is a provocative move by those who have put up the flag as they will well know its significance			1
' many geopolitical conflicts and humanitarian crises in the @entity302 get adopted as ' @entity5 causes ' and subsequently get manipulated by myopic @entity305 narratives			0
' it is worrying that legitimate grievances surrounding @entity22 and the plight of the @entity17 people are combined with jihadist symbols '			0
@entity311 has admitted it received complaints about the flag but when they arrived to pull it down it was already gone			2
a council spokesman said : ' the council can confirm that following reports this morning of a flag erected on the @entity97 , council officials took steps to remove it but found it had already been taken down by @entity324 , a well - known local activist and promoter of community cohesion			1
the flag was removed following concerns that it could cause community tension			2
' the council welcomes the removal of this flag			2
we have consistently demonstrated that there is no place for hate in @entity19 , whatever form it takes			1
we take decisive action to ensure people 's actions do not affect the strong community cohesion that underpins @entity19			1
' this borough 's community is proud to act as one @entity19 and the council and its partners will always act to preserve and promote this united spirit , including removing any unauthorised flag on public space			1
' the council 's controversial mayor @entity268 sparked a storm of protest last month to after raising the @entity17 flag over the town hall ' in solidarity with @entity22 '			2
mr @entity268 ordered the flag to fly ' in support of a ceasefire and peace '			2
@entity272 leaders condemned the move as ' destructive ' for community relations as local residents said the council should concentrate on ' potholes and bins ' and not international conflicts			0
pro-palestine supporters also blocked the nearby @entity370 , waved flags and yelled slogans in a protest days later .			1

the flag was put up outside @entity18 estate as part of @entity379 campaign
taken down by @entity324 , 77 , who works at a nearby church
it contains script used by all @entity113 as a declaration of their faith
but emblem has been hijacked by extremists who use it to promote jihad
anti-extremism campaigners condemn ' provocative ' act in @entity19
after three days it was pulled down amid fears it would cause offence
