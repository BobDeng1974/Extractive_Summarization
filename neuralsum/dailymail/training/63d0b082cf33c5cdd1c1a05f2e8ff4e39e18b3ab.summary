the prospect of @entity3 's @entity2 squad being bolstered by @entity6 wannabe @entity5 @entity4 appears to have been severely dented by the non-arrival of necessary paperwork			1
there now seems to be no likelihood that he will be in contention for the @entity14 first round match at home to the @entity16 in march , despite his hopes of becoming a @entity19 citizen by then			1
the @entity20 said on wednesday that they had not received any relevant documentation before the december 31 deadline which saw a rule change hindering players from switching nationality			0
@entity6 @entity4 is applying for @entity19 citizenship after living in the @entity28 area since 2008 @entity4 , 25 , has lived in the @entity28 area since 2008 and has already been ranked as high as 71 in the world , although he is currently down at a falsely low 156 after struggling with wrist injuries last season			1
many see the athletic baseliner as having top 30 potential			0
on tuesday he was reported from @entity35 , where he is currently playing , as saying he hoped to be in the reckoning for the tie in @entity38 , the biggest on @entity19 soil for decades , as he expects his citizenship to be confirmed within the next week			1
however , governing body the @entity20 said on wednesday : ' we did n't receive any request regarding the @entity2 before the december 31st deadline for him to be considered to play in the competition			1
' last year they passed a new rule â€“ coming into effect on january 1 - forbidding a player to switch nationalities for official team competitions if they have represented another nation already			0
while @entity4 has never played a " live " rubber for @entity6 ( when a tie was yet to be decided ) he has featured in their squad three times , the last being nearly three years ago			2
@entity4 in action during the @entity61 at @entity63 's @entity62 last year it seems the only way he can now hope to represent @entity67 in official team competitions is if he starts an appeal process , on the basis that his citizenship was imminent at the time of the regulation coming in			2
he would need to be supported by the @entity73 , whose lawyers have been involved in his application to become a @entity19 citizen			1
a @entity73 spokesperson said on wednesday : ' we are awaiting a decision regarding @entity4 's citizenship application			0
should he be successful , then it 's a matter for the @entity20 as to whether he is then eligible to represent the @entity84 team			0
' regardless of that , @entity85 is still able to represent @entity3 as an individual at tournaments if he gains his passport , which is entirely up to him			2
wednesday 's development solves any potential dilemma for @entity19 captain @entity92 about whether to select him for @entity38 , where @entity93 is expected to play alongside @entity94 , who is on the verge of the top 100			1
@entity3 @entity2 captain @entity92 appears from the locker room in @entity99 last april the match is being played on an indoor hard court , but in future @entity85 could be a real asset on clay , which he is comfortable on , and the weakest for many @entity19 players			1
@entity92 has built a strong team spirit in the @entity2 that @entity93 has bought into , and it might have been disrupted by a late incomer			0
although @entity4 is a popular enough figure among his peers , when he first declared his intention to play for @entity3 last year it did not go down universally well			2
nor was his appearance for @entity112 in the @entity113 in 2013 totally accepted either			0
@entity3 celebrate after beating @entity16 3 - 1 in the @entity114 in @entity115 last year former @entity19 no 2 @entity116 was among those who spoke out last year , although the @entity119 's plummeting ranking since does not see him as a realistic contender for the @entity38 team			1
@entity116 might have been considered , but has somewhat vanished from the @entity19 tennis scene after suffering knee problems last summer , and is no longer part of any official @entity73 set - up			0
however , he is said to be training back in the @entity127 area and planning to come back at smaller events in the next month			0
