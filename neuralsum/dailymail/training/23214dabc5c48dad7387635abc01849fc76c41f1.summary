by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:20 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 15:32 est , 21 november 2013 the @entity2 has taken the dramatic step of trying to override the @entity5 ’s ability to outrun the nomination approval process			2
senate majority leader @entity7 invoked the move , known in @entity9 as the ' nuclear option , ' to end what he considers long - standing abuses of blocking procedures that for more than two centuries have required a 60 - vote threshold -- instead of a simple majority vote -- to overcome			1
for years , filibusters have been used by those in the minority party to push back the approval of measures that they do not like			1
today , @entity7 put an end to the tactic and president @entity25 came out in support the move			1
support : president @entity25 gave a statement endorsing the @entity2 's move saying that it will help get more done he said that since he took office in 2009 , there has been an ‘ unprecedented pattern of obstruction in @entity48 ’ by politicians who ‘ abuse arcane procedural tactics			0
’ the president said that as a former senator , he values the chamber 's powers			2
but he says some rules are now being used as a tool to ' grind business to a halt			0
' @entity7 , who launched the effort under a parliamentary maneuver scripted in advance , accused @entity5 of ' unbelievable , unprecedented obstruction ' of @entity25 's selections to fill court vacancies and other offices			0
' it 's time to change the @entity2 , before this institution becomes obsolete , ' he said			0
his @entity5 counterpart @entity2 minority leader @entity68 of @entity70 accused @entity30 of exercising raw power and said they would regret it when political fortunes switched			1
he likened the effort to the president 's since - discredited promise that @entity40 who like their health care can keep it under @entity78 , noting that @entity7 promised last summer he would n't seek to change the process for approving appointees			1
' he may as well just have said , " if you like the rules of the @entity2 , you can keep them , " ' @entity81 said			0
if the filibuster ban is upheld , it could dramatically ease the bottleneck on stalled nominees including federal judges			0
it would also - and will almost certainly - curtail the influence of the @entity5 as they are in the minority of the @entity2 , which could lead to an escalation of already - frustrating levels of partisanship			0
bipartisan bickering : seen here the day before the filibuster debate , republicans @entity68 ( left ) and @entity99 speaker @entity98 ( right ) are against the procedural change ' i think you 'll see harder - edged partisan choices , and the filter that exists today to kind of weed those folks out is going to be less , ' said @entity107 senator @entity107			1
democrats led by @entity7 sought to change proceedings so that only a simple majority was required to clear the way for a final vote			1
the @entity2 vote was 52 - 48 , with three @entity30 voting against the rules change			1
a motion to overturn the change failed			0
@entity5 were livid about the sudden moves by @entity7 , who earlier this year made similar threats to use the nuclear option but was averted with a last - minute compromise			1
' this is a power grab , ' argued senator @entity123			0
' it 's another partisan political maneuver to permit the @entity30 majority to do whatever it wants to do			1
taking away leverage : senator @entity107 has used filibusters as a way to prevent judicial appointments until he got more information about the attack in @entity134 ' in this case it 's to advance the president 's regulatory agenda , and the only cure for it that i know is an election			0
’ @entity5 contend that @entity7 used complex procedural tactics to break @entity2 rules that require that any changes to those rules be made by a super-majority of two - thirds of senators			1
the change is the most far - reaching since 1975 , when a two - thirds requirement for cutting off filibusters against legislation and all nominations was lowered to 60 votes			1
though the phrase may suggest the beginning of an international arms race , it has nothing to do with weapons			0
the ' nuclear option ' is a term that was coined to describe how the majority party would be able to unleash a political explosion of ill - will			1
because switching the rules from requiring 60 votes to a simple majority of just 51 votes , the majority party will be able to pass anything they want			1
when the @entity5 were the majority party in the @entity2 , they threatened to pull the proverbial trigger , but cooler heads prevailed			0
the maneuvering occurred after a decade in which first one party , then the other , nursed a lengthening list of grievances over delays in confirmation for nominees to the courts			0
@entity81 noted that @entity30 sought to thwart some of president @entity184 's conservative appointees , while democrats say the @entity5 has done the same to @entity25 's appointees			1
in a sign that a showdown was imminent , dozens of senators filed in to listen to @entity7 and @entity81 swap accusations and then cast votes on a complicated series of parliamentary moves			2
even so , there was no doubt about the outcome , if @entity7 insisted			0
@entity30 control 55 seats , compared with 45 for @entity5			1
‘ these nominees deserve at least an up - or - down vote			2
but @entity5 filibusters deny them a fair vote , ’ he said			2
to which @entity81 noted that the @entity2 has confirmed 215 of @entity25 's picks to the courts since he became president , and rejected two			0
‘ that 's a confirmation rate of 99 percent , ’ he said pointedly			0
the clash capped a period of increasing irritation on the part of @entity30			2
‘ they have decided that their base demands a permanent campaign against the president and maximum use of every tool available , ’ @entity30 senator @entity211 , a leading advocate of revamping filibuster rules , said wednesday of @entity5			2
flip - flopping : when the @entity5 were the majority , they threatened to ' go nuclear ' and now they are complaining that the @entity30 did ( @entity68 at right and @entity123 at left on thursday ) he said that consideration ‘ is trumping the appropriate exercise of advice and consent ’ by @entity5 senators			1
the @entity230 is viewed as second only to the @entity232 in power because it rules on disputes over @entity99 and federal agency actions			0
the circuit 's eight judges are divided evenly between @entity30 and @entity5 presidential appointees			2
senior democrats wary of future @entity5 retaliation until recently opposed the move , but growing numbers of them have begun lining up behind @entity7 's effort			0
in addition , two dozen groups , including the @entity246 and @entity247 , wrote lawmakers wednesday supporting the change , saying that ‘ rampant , ideology - based obstructionism is the new norm in the @entity2			2

senators regularly stall nominations or votes by using filibusters to ' run out the clock ' and stall the process
today the @entity30 majority leader *effectively* banned the tactic
the change means that they do n't need 60 votes from the 100 - person chamber , and now they only need a simple majority of 51 to pass measures
because there are 55 @entity30 and 45 republicans , that means that @entity30 could *possibly* win every vote they put up
called ' going nuclear ' because it will unleash a wave of ill - will
