president @entity0 has admitted exchanging letters with the @entity3 president , @entity2 , in a move which could set the stage for the first meeting between a @entity8 and @entity3 leader since @entity3 's 1979 revolution			1
it is hoped a meeting could lead to a solution in the row over @entity3 's nuclear weapons programme , which @entity0 said is ' larger than the @entity16 crises '			1
foreign secretary @entity17 is also said to be due to meet @entity18 , @entity3 's minister of foreign affairs , at the @entity20 general assembly meeting in @entity21			1
' we came in [ and ] stabilized the situation ' @entity0 told @entity25 's ' @entity24 ' on sunday when asked about economic recovery @entity0 intends to close ' loopholes for the rich ' ... and is facing stiff opposition from @entity29			0
some say they will only play ball if @entity0 delays enacting his health care bill but @entity0 admitted that it would not be easy			0
in a television interview aired on @entity37 , on sunday , when asked whether he and @entity2 had ' reached out ' to each other , @entity0 confirmed that they had exchanged letters , the @entity35 reports			0
@entity0 said : ' i have			0
and he 's reached out to me			0
we have n't spoken directly ... ' he added : ' negotiations with the @entity3 is always difficult			2
' i think this new president is not going to suddenly make it easy			0
' @entity45 has reportedly also tweeted on president @entity2 's @entity46 account that he would also meet @entity47 , despite the @entity48 not requesting a meeting			2
@entity45 has also tweeted on president @entity2 's @entity46 account that he would also meet @entity47 the @entity50 said it had not had official word from @entity45 about a meeting			2
the @entity8 and its allies suspect @entity3 of seeking a nuclear weapons capability			1
@entity45 says its nuclear programme is purely for peaceful purposes , but @entity57 regards it as a threat to its existence and refuses to rule out military action			1
with the election of an apparently more pragmatic president in the @entity63 educated moderate @entity2 , it has been hoped @entity65 countries might see a better chance for diplomacy and strike a deal to curb @entity3 â€™s uranium enrichment programme and avoid any conflict			1
the tweet has been accepted with cautious optimism			0
if mr @entity17 meets with @entity2 or @entity18 it could heal the diplomatic wounds which were opened when the @entity48 embassy in @entity45 was attacked by a mob in 2011			2
the last meeting between an @entity8 and @entity3 leader was in 1977 when president @entity79 met @entity80			0
during the interview @entity0 suggested involving @entity3 in wider talks on @entity16			1
he said @entity45 needed to recognise the impact of what was happening in @entity16 , adding : ' ... what 's happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just @entity16 but is destabilising the entire region			2
' @entity0 said that @entity3 's leaders should not take comfort in the fact that @entity8 has not used force against @entity16 and remember that preventing a nuclear arms race in the @entity94 was a higher priority for the @entity8 than than ridding @entity16 of chemical weapons			1
' on the other hand , what they should draw from this lesson is that there is the potential of resolving these issues diplomatically			0

@entity106 row over @entity3 's nuclear programme is ' larger than @entity16 crises '
foreign secretary @entity17 may also meet @entity3 's foreign affairs minister
