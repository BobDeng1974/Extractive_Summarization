nestled among moss - covered rocks , these forgotten pillboxes , gun batteries and tank traps are forlorn reminders of how drastically @entity6 's coast changed to stop a @entity8 invasion			1
many of the @entity11 defences captured by photographer @entity12 now blend in with their surroundings , dangling precariously over the sea or being split in two by the forces of nature			1
mr @entity12 , 46 , travelled 23,000 miles to photograph 143 forgotten coastal relics across @entity6 , as well as northern @entity18 , @entity19 , the @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
forgotten : photographer @entity12 has documented the abandoned war defences littering @entity6 's coast			1
left : @entity24 in @entity25 , where a full - scale d - day rehearsal took place in april 1944			1
right : concrete tank defences in the forests near @entity30 , @entity31 @entity32 : long since abandoned , the 1892 - built @entity33 on the @entity34 in @entity25 stored field guns and housed ammunition in preparation for the d - day landings			1
it also became an anti-aircraft artillery battery			0
@entity34 stone was used to build the @entity42 in @entity43 he researched the sites meticulously on the internet - and once he got there , he often found the places he was photographing were not even well - known among locals			1
mr @entity12 , a father of one from @entity51 , told @entity52 : ' i 've been a photographer for 15 to 20 years and i 'd often come across military topics in my work			1
like most people in @entity58 my family has a wartime history and i decided it was something i wanted to look at more closely			0
' my family came from @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 so they were all caught up in the conflict			0
another member of my family flew in the @entity67			0
somehow , as a photographer , i think this is my act of remembrance			0
' i started with a simple @entity72 search and moved on to literature and other sources to find the wartime remains			0
' some of them are very well - known but others were a lot harder to find			2
it was important to me to find more subtle ones , which people either did n't know about or which blended into the landscape			0
' camouflage : a pillbox among rocks at @entity86 , @entity87 , a strategic defence since the time of the @entity90			2
in 1940 , it was again garrisoned and fortified with a light anti-aircraft battery and three pillboxes made deliberately to blend with their surroundings left : @entity96 's @entity95 had to be defended , as it would have offered invaders a short passage to @entity99 bypassing the @entity100 and the @entity101			1
right : in @entity24 , wartime defences have become overgrown and almost completely hidden by trees near the water line cracked : the elements had hewn this @entity107 defence in two at @entity108 , northern @entity18			2
the @entity109 believed the @entity110 would regard @entity108 , the closest point on mainland @entity112 to the @entity58 coast , as an ideal beach for an invasion			0
this defence was removed in 2013 for one shot , a never - used pillbox by the sea in @entity25 's @entity24 , the tide had to be just high enough to touch the concrete base - but not high enough to drown mr @entity12			1
' it was viewable from a beach but it was n't easy , ' he said			0
' i had to do a lot of research			0
a fully high tide would 've cut me off completely and once i had the shot it was a case of grabbing my tripod and running			0
' another image , shot from the site of the d - day landings in northern @entity18 , shows the temporary harbour structures which allowed the landings to happen 70 years ago and which still float undisturbed within sight of the coast			1
at @entity86 in @entity87 , a pillbox appears almost completely camouflaged among oblong grey rocks on an overcast day			2
in @entity34 , @entity25 , mr @entity12 captured the @entity33 - built in 1892 beside what would be the world 's largest man - made harbour			1
used in the @entity146 , it was expanded after 1939 and used to house ammunition used in the d - day landings			2
and in @entity30 , @entity31 , a line of concrete anti-tank defences are themselves covered in moss , stretching to the horizon through the forest along a line sliced through the trees			2
@entity157 : this fortification at @entity160 's @entity159 , part of the famous @entity162 in @entity163 , would have been a crucial lookout for enemy planes striking : on the other side of the @entity168 , at @entity166 , the @entity6 built a floating harbour which was used for ten months , landing 2.5 million men , 500,000 vehicles and 4 million tonnes of supplies			1
it can still be seen today as distant black specks in the water travelling far and wide : @entity176 , @entity22 ( left ) , where @entity107 soldiers built a huge coastal fortress preventing allies from using the @entity181 - the stretch of sea between @entity22 and @entity19			1
mr @entity12 ( right ) travelled 23,000 miles for his project and spent £ 16,000 some of the locations are no longer in sight - either submerged by the shifting sands and waters or by more human intervention			1
some , especially on the continent , were destroyed by the governments of the countries mr @entity12 was visited			2
others are barely visible - blending into the landscape so well that it is a struggle to see them			0
the £ 16,000 project was made possible after almost half the total was raised through online crowdfunding			0
mr @entity12 thanked the donors , adding : ' it was incredible to get the funds			2
i think it 's a subject matter that touches everyone , and that made me realise how important it was to follow through with the project '			2
the images , which first appeared in a touring exhibition last year , are now being published together for the first time in mr @entity12 's book , @entity214			1
mr @entity12 added : ' these man - made objects and zones of defence now sit silently in the landscape , imbued with the history of our recent past			1
' some remain proud and strong , some are gently decaying			0
many now lie prone beneath the cliffs where they once stood			0
' whilst i capture the individual beauty of these objects in their landscapes , the series of photographs becomes much more than a set of traditional landscapes			0
my aim is that the collection will become a permanent photographic record of the past			0
' @entity214 ( 2014 ) is published by @entity237 and is available for £ 35 .			0

@entity12 , 46 , travelled 23,000 miles to photograph 143 sites in @entity6 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity21 and @entity22
scenes *include* crumbling concrete fortress at the world 's largest man - made harbour in @entity34 , @entity25
elsewhere there are pillboxes and batteries almost in the sea , camouflaged by falling rocks or split in two
