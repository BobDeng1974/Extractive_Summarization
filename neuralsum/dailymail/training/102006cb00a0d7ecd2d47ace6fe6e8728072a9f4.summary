' he ’s got amazing touch , ' said @entity0			1

he sounded surprised to learn that @entity3 played left - handed , and when asked to describe the president 's best shot , @entity0 said that ' ; he hit a few			1
'' ' he ’s a lefty , but to see him out hitting shots — he hit it well , and we did n’t play under the easiest conditions			0
' back in the swing of things : president @entity3 waves in the doorway of @entity59 as he departs from @entity60 on monday back to business : @entity3 jogs up the stairs of @entity59 upon his departure from @entity64 heading for @entity65 ( left ) as an aide carries on the golf back of @entity3 's friend @entity68 bags of fun : an aide heaves several golf bags up the stairs of @entity59 pushed on how he got the invitation , @entity0 said : ' he calls up and says , ' @entity75 you wan na play ? ' ' obviously there is a process that 's involved , and i was invited to play , and it was an invitation that certainly you do n't turn down , especially [ since ] he 's an avid golfer , and so am i. ' so we went out there and we had just a great round of golf with @entity35 and @entity37 , and it was a good day			1
' the traveling pool of journalists who follow the president 's every move were reportedly furious after being shut out of his round of golf and not being allowed on to the club grounds on sunday			1
it has long been a @entity27 tradition that pool reporters cover the president 's rounds of golf and even have the opportunity for a few questions on the course			0

the outrage over the lack of transparency comes as much of the bill for the pricey trip will be paid for by tax payers , yet president @entity3 did not feel it appropriate to even release one photo of his time out on the course			1
the president played with the notorious philanderer on sunday after getting a private lesson from @entity0 ' former coach the day before			1
however the only inside reports about the rounds came from a golf journalist who happened to be in the clubhouse at the time			0
' speaking on behalf of the @entity144 , i can say a broad cross section of our members from print , radio , online and tv have today expressed extreme frustration to me about having absolutely no access to the @entity153 this entire weekend , ' @entity142 reporter @entity141 said			0
on the course : @entity155 was the only network to air footage of president @entity3 during one of his golf outings , but it does not appear to be whilet he played with @entity0 using his lessons : @entity3 spent three days in @entity64 over the president 's day weekend one last round : president @entity3 ( seen in the white cap ) played an estimated five or six rounds in three days ' there is a very simple but important principle we will continue to fight for today and in the days ahead : transparency			1
' $ 943,687.50 : estimated cost of a trip for @entity59 from @entity171 to @entity172 and then back to @entity65 $ 13,500 : cost to rent out three four - bedroom guest cottages at @entity174 for three nights $ 24,000 : cost of an eight - hour private golf lesson with famed instructor @entity177 $ 1,800 : @entity179 fees for three guests for two rounds of golf $ 1,600 : cost of four caddies for two rounds of golf $ 4,620 : cost of 20 rooms at the @entity186 for traveling press and security detail based on the government day rate total : $ 989,207 the president 's deputy press secretary @entity191 responded to the pool 's concerns by simply saying that they were previously told about the level of access - or lack thereof - that they should expect from the weekend			0
@entity200 reported that in 2012 , it cost $ 179,750 per flight hour to run @entity59			0
using that rate - even though it is likely higher now since gas prices have risen - the cost of the flights to @entity64 and back to @entity65 on monday totaled $ 943,687.50			1
he rented out all three of the four - bedroom guest cottages on the grounds of @entity174 for the whole of the long weekend , as well about 20 hotel rooms from the nearby @entity186 - which is about 20 minutes drive from the course - for his traveling entourage of press and security			0
expectantly , their price differentials are significant , as one night in a guest cottage costs $ 1,500 while the @entity219 told @entity220 that they charged the government a day rate of $ 77 per room			0
on top of the logistical expenses , the whole point of the trip was to relax on the golf course , which involves a whole host of expenses in itself			0
guest greens fees at the @entity64 are $ 300 per person , and each player hires a caddy who costs $ 200 per round			2
former @entity36 president @entity236 ( @entity237 ) and @entity36 president @entity3 ( r ) chat after completing the first hole during a golf game at @entity241 , @entity242 , september 24 , 2011 for three guests to play two rounds of golf over the weekend , greens fees come to $ 1,800 and the caddies fees for the foursome total $ 1,600			1
another personal expense that mr @entity3 racked up came from the eight hour one - on - one lesson with golf pro mr @entity177			2
since those lessons typically cost $ 3,000 , that means that mr @entity3 's bill came to a tidy $ 24,000 after his intensive session on saturday			2
during his stay , the president never left the grounds of the golf club , meaning that his transportation and security costs were kept to a minimum			0
a spokesman for the nearby police department said that they had not been asked by the @entity265 to provide any additional security			0
while this is the first time that the president has played golf with @entity49 - who has won the most titles in the storied sport - it is not the first time that they have met			2
the disgraced golfer did a reading at one of president @entity3 's inaugural festivities in 2009 and followed that up with a visit to the @entity27			1
in @entity280 's 2012 biography of president @entity3 he especially looked at his enduring love affair with basketball			1
traveling to @entity283 , an elite prep school in @entity284 to discover what his classmates made of his skills , @entity280 discovered that he was n't that good : ' if @entity3 was unhappy about his playing time , the truth is he had to work exceedingly hard just to make the team			2
he made it more because of his intense passion for the game -- his will -- than anything else			0
… the reality was that @entity298 , as skilled and intelligent a player as he was , could not stand out in this group			0
he had good court sense and an ability to slash to the basket , but was an unreliable outside shooter and not much of a jumper ... ' decades later , a story emerged that his nickname was @entity307 , playing off his last name and a propensity to fire away from long range , but few team members recalled that nickname … and said the real gunner was @entity314 , who was better than @entity3 but barely got more playing time … ' he loved basketball so much , i think a lot of things have been blown out of proportion , ” said [ former teammate @entity320			2
… [ @entity321 ] hen it came down to playing time , he [ @entity298 ] was n’t one of the five best			0
” in fact , @entity320 and other teammates pointed out , @entity298 was only occasionally considered one of the top eight … ' @entity3 … was also among the most earthbound – he could not jump high enough to dunk the ball			2
“ @entity298 ’s lack of ups was obvious , ” recalled [ former player @entity328			0
in fact , [ coach @entity332 ] @entity331 coined a phrase for the phenomenon : @entity3 , famous for his no - jump jump shot !			2
