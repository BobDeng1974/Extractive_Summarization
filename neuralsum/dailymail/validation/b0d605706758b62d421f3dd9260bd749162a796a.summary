' things got so bad that i tried to jump off a bridge in @entity21 in 2007 , trying to kill myself			0
' he spent 28 days in a mental institution following this incident , and that is when he finally left the church			0

' then , there was the treatment he received from other members shortly before he left the church			0

@entity7 's interview meanwhile could not come at a worse time for the church , with the @entity91 documentary going @entity92 set to premiere later this month			2
the film takes a look at the religion , and how its treatment of a-list members like @entity98 and @entity7 , differs from others in the church			2
it is based on the book of the same name , which was released to widespread critical acclaim in 2013 , and is based on interviews conducted with over 200 members of the religion who decided to leave the church			2
