during a month filled with dropped points and squandered chances , @entity0 have missed an absent striker and , after @entity5 ’s visit , they do so once more			1
@entity0 , of course , are a different proposition without @entity8 but the player they could have done with most in the 223rd @entity11 derby was his sidekick			1
@entity13 ’s injury has proven damaging			1
@entity13 has spent most of september with a thigh problem sustained , much to @entity16 ’ anger , on @entity18 duty ; the longer he has been out , the clearer his importance has become			1
@entity0 have taken one point from a possible nine without him and need his speed and ruthlessness			1
@entity13 is suited ( not booted ) as he is guided to his seat in the stands ahead of the @entity11 derby @entity13 was injured on @entity18 duty and has been out for most of september @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : mignolet 5.5 ; @entity27 7 , @entity28 7.5 , @entity29 7 , @entity30 7.5 ; @entity31 8 , @entity32 8.5 ; @entity33 7.5 , @entity34 8 , @entity35 5 ( @entity36 60min , 6 ) ; @entity37 6 ( @entity38 88 )			1
subs not used : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44			0
booked : @entity31 , @entity30			0
@entity5 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity46 5.5 ; hibbert 5.5 ( @entity47 73 , 6 ) , @entity48 7 , @entity49 8 , @entity50 6.5 ; @entity51 7.5 , @entity52 6.5 ( @entity53 80 ) , @entity54 5 ; @entity55 6 ( @entity56 31 , 6 ) , @entity57 6 , @entity58 5			1

man of the match : @entity32			0
had @entity13 , rather than @entity37 , provided the spear to @entity0 ’s attack on saturday , the game would surely have been taken away from @entity5 ’s grasp long before @entity49 slammed in an extraordinary injury - time effort to cancel out @entity31 ’s free - kick			1
@entity37 had two glorious opportunities , either side of half - time , from around six yards but fluffed both			1
the second miss in the 67th minute , with the goal almost at his mercy , left @entity16 screaming in frustration			2
@entity13 would not have been so wasteful			2
the sooner he can come back , the better for @entity16 and @entity0			1
@entity13 was in training on sunday and joined by the @entity0 manager , who also took part in a series of sprints , slaloms , jogs and agility drills using rope ladders under the eye of two of the club ’s coaching staff			1
@entity37 missed two good chances on saturday , including this effort which was saved by @entity46 @entity99 defender @entity98 scored his first goal of the season but the weekend @entity103 pace - setters could only draw 1 - 1 with @entity104 after @entity105 equalised in the final minute			1
@entity0 and @entity99 have met twice before , both times in the group phase of the @entity108 in 2002 - 03			1
both matches ended in draws			0
the forward looked pain - free as he completed the workout but the midweek @entity108 trip to @entity99 may be too soon			0
‘ we needed to see if he was going to train on the friday to get him through to the saturday but the message on thursday was that he would struggle , ’ said @entity16			2
‘ he was n’t close to playing			0
i will see how he is ( for @entity99 )			0
' he was n’t far away but not close enough to be on the bench			0
that pace ( @entity13 has ) through the middle can help , as you know			2
but whatever part of the game he comes on , he is a top talent			0
we want to score goals but as the season goes on it will become better and better			0
@entity13 celebrates scoring against @entity129 in @entity0 's @entity131 opener @entity31 is now the highest scorer in @entity11 derbies in the @entity131 with nine goals			1
@entity134 ( 13 ) holds the record in league games			0
merseyside derby appearances @entity138 41 @entity134 36 @entity139 34 @entity140 33 @entity141 32 @entity31 32 ‘ i think the game against @entity5 was a step towards that			2
it was an excellent performance against a very good side and a game in which we were clearly the better team			0
’ for @entity5 manager @entity149 there was feeling a season that has stuttered might turn on the missile @entity49 launched into the @entity153 net			2
‘ we needed something like that , ’ said @entity149			0
‘ when you are 2 - 0 up against @entity159 at home and draw and then at @entity161 you draw when the ball gets deflected and ends up in your net , it shatters the confidence			2
this is an incredible moment			0
@entity165 gave us something back			0
’ @entity166 is likely to be fined after he stormed out of @entity167 having been dropped from @entity0 ’s 18 - man squad .			1

@entity0 missed @entity13 in 1 - 1 draw with @entity5
striker has been out for most of september with thigh injury
@entity16 joined @entity13 in extra training on sunday
@entity37 missed two great chances against @entity5
