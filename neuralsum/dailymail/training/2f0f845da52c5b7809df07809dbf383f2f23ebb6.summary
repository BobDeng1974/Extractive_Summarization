these are the @entity1 bunkers that still crouch on the landscape as echoes of the biggest conflict in history			2
photographer @entity7 scoured the wartime territory of @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and even @entity12 to take these eerie images			1
he has captured the stern beauty of structures once meant to withstand the fury of war			2
mr @entity7 says it ' is as if they were still on guard but nobody had told them the war is over ' the @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity11 : this lookout post formed part of a decoy airfield , intended to draw away @entity49 attacks			1
it was not a success , the @entity64 did bomb it - but with wooden bombs ... the @entity68 transmitter bunker , @entity69 , @entity9 : graffiti artists have given this inland fortification , just east of @entity72 , a second , less destructive chance at life as a canvas for their typographical artworks the 42 - year - old , originally from @entity79 , @entity80 , but now living in @entity81 , @entity82 , started his bunker odyssey in 2009 and has now visited them all over @entity85			1
' i originally found the geometry and shape of the structures fascinating and the fact that they were just left standing alone in a farmer 's field or on a beach , ' he said			1
' it was as if they were still on guard but nobody had told them the war is over			0
once i started photographing them it was impossible not to be moved by what the buildings symbolised and what they have witnessed			1
' vital defences : field marshal @entity107 inspects the @entity39 fortifications in @entity10 in march 1944 , three months before the d - day landings that spelled @entity110 of the @entity112 empire in @entity85 built by thousands of forced labourers , the @entity39 fortifications stretch from the @entity116 border to the northernmost tip of @entity118			1
begun in 1942 , following the devastating raid by @entity122 commandos which destroyed the dry dock at @entity125 , they were strengthened in 1944 on the orders of field marshal @entity107 , who believed @entity43 could not resist an invasion of @entity85 were it not stopped at the beach			1
he ordered strings of concrete pillboxes built along the coast , as well as the planting of anti-tank obstacles and millions of mines , in the hope his forces could destroy an @entity49 invasion force before it could gain a toe - hold			2
the defences were never completed and , as history shows , they were insufficient to hold back @entity122 and @entity143 troops as they flooded into @entity85 on @entity145			0
however , in subsequent years , their existence was used to answer @entity149 charges that @entity151 leaders had delayed the opening of a second front in @entity85			0
most of the structures photographed for mr @entity7 's set are part of the @entity39 fortifications , put up by the @entity158 between 1942 and 1945 in anticipation of an @entity49 invasion of the continent from @entity122			1
the first were chosen simply because the @entity9 - based photographer had noticed them while driving between assignments , and been taken by their surreal , decaying aesthetic			1
but subsequently he began to hunt down more and more unusual bunkers dotted around the coast and countryside of north - west @entity85			1
he researched online , used @entity170 maps and scoured history books in the search for more of these ghosts of @entity85 's brutal wartime history			0
' obviously a lot of them are the same , so i avoid repeating myself , ' mr @entity7 said			2
' i choose them by design , concentrating on those which are unusual			0
' he added : ' it 's almost absurd that these things are still there			0
' the shape of them is purely functional , it 's just this weird shape and if you did n't know anything about it you would think " what 's this ? " ' mr @entity7 uses a special technique to photograph his bunkers that gives them their eerie glow , making them seem almost like the apparitions of fallen soldiers			1
he explained that each photograph is taking just on the cusp of night - time , in a 15 - minute time window just as the last light of the day fades			2
each is the product of a long , 10 - minute exposure , with mr @entity7 walking around the structures with a strobe flash to shine light on them from every angle			1
he must dress all in black , with his face covered by a black balaclava , as he carries out the lengthy process to ensure that he does not appear in the final image			0
' the technique i use when i photograph the bunkers means that i have a 10 to 15 minute window of opportunity to photograph them , ' he said			2
he explained that he must capture them in perfect light conditions just as day turns to night			0
' i walk around the structures with a strobe and flash them , ' he added			0
' they are very long exposures of about 10 minutes each			0
' d - day landings : a @entity143 @entity232 landing barge , tightly packed with helmeted soldiers , approaches the shore at @entity235 , @entity10 , during initial @entity49 landing operations , on june 6 , 1944 the first wave : @entity143 soldiers swarm from their landing craft towards the beaches of @entity235 , where they faced fierce resistance from @entity243 soldiers holed up in the bunkers lining the shore only the brave : after landing at the shore at @entity235 , these @entity122 troops wait for the signal to move forward into the @entity10 countryside mr @entity7 says his favourite image is the anti-submarine defences at @entity251 , near @entity252 , one of the few in his set to show @entity122 fortifications			1
' i think that these structures almost look like the @entity259 statues , ' he said			0
' there 's something very strange about them			0
the pattern they make coming out of the water i find very haunting and i did n't expect there would be any bunker kind of stuff in @entity252			2
' another curious bunker photographed by mr @entity7 is the observation tower for a dummy airfield in @entity272 , @entity11			1
@entity273 , current owner of the land in which the bunker sits , told him : ' did you know this observation tower was a part of a decoy ( fake ) airfield intended to distract allied air attacks			2
' this was not a success in this case ... the allied bombed it but ... with wooden bombs			1
' the @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity9 : the @entity39 was begun in 1942 , following the devastating raid by @entity122 commandos which destroyed the dry dock at @entity125 , and strengthened in 1944 type @entity294 @entity293 , @entity295 , @entity296 : field marshal @entity107 ordered the second phase of building because he believed @entity43 could not resist an invasion of @entity85 were it not stopped at the beach the @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 : used to slow down tanks and mechanised infantry , landmines were often placed between the teeth we had some defences too : the @entity251 submarine defence boom , near @entity252 , @entity12 , which are mr @entity7 's favourite in the entire collection ' i 'm not trying to make an anti-war statement ' : nevertheless , mr @entity7 , pictured , who photographs the bunkers between paid assignments , says it is ' impossible not to be moved by what the buildings symbolised and what they have witnessed ' the photos were not taken to make an anti-war statement , mr @entity7 said , but to offer an insight into a fascinating chapter in history			1
' as a photographer you try and point things out to people which you find beautiful or fascinating and ask them to take a longer , closer look , ' he said			0
' i 'm not trying to make an anti-war statement but just bring them to peoples attention , show people these amazing buildings , steeped in such incredible history are still scattered throughout @entity85 's fields and dunes			2
' i work on the bunker photographs only in the winter , it 's taken about three winters to photograph the collection so far			0
it 's a personal project , so i have to find time between my regular paid assignments			0
' it 's surprising to see some bunkers being used by farmers for other purposes , such as storing animal feed , farm equipment etc. i 'm also amazed at the shear number of them still around , some in very good condition			0

photographer @entity7 captured these haunting images of bunkers left standing from the @entity43 ' @entity39 fortifications
he started photographing them for their aesthetic appeal , but says it became ' impossible not to be moved by what the buildings symbolise '
one incredible structure was a lookout post from a @entity43 decoy airfield which the @entity64 bombed - with wooden bombs
