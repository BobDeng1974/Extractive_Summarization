by @entity0 published : 14:00 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 17:34 est , 3 october 2012 a son has been convicted of making his elderly male lover go through a sham wedding with his @entity5 mum so she could get a green card and stay in the @entity7			1
in a convoluted plot , @entity8 , 32 , supposedly told besotted @entity10 that the cars and restaurant business he had bought him were not enough			1
to win his love mr @entity10 , in his 60s , duly married @entity15 , 54 , whom he lived with for 10 years in a fake married life that fooled everyone			1
in another twist , prosecutors have claimed that even @entity8 ’s marriage was a fake so he could get a green card and that he had gone through three attempted sham weddings before			1
he and his mother - who was called a ‘ master actress ’ by a judge - have now been convicted of marriage fraud and conspiracy and face up to five years in jail			2
the extraordinary tale came apart in @entity41 , @entity42 , where all the parties were living			2
different couples : prosecutors allege that the marriage between @entity21 and @entity10 ( left ) was a sham , and that really @entity10 was carrying out a secret relationship with @entity8 ( right ) charged : now @entity21 and @entity8 ( but not @entity10 ) face federal charges and deportation @entity51 and his mother came to the @entity7 on a student exchange programme more than a decade ago and began a construction business where he hired mr @entity55 , who was a widower at the time			1
prosecutors claim that even though @entity8 was married himself , the two men began an affair during which mr @entity10 showered him with gifts			1
that however was not enough for @entity51 and as his mother was having visa problems , he persuaded mr @entity55 to marry his mother , a respected high school teacher , so she could remain in the @entity7			2
over the next several years they lived a lie and filled up scrapbooks with fake memories and took bogus photographs and videos on family outings			2
prosecutor @entity71 said that even posts put on social networking websites were part of the elaborate fraud			0
according to @entity79 , after years of watching this happen under her nose @entity8 ’s wife got jealous she was sharing her husband with another man so went to the authorities			1
by that time her husband had become abusive and supposedly used physical and verbal intimidation to get his own way			0
another layer : @entity8 ( right ) claims he could not have been having an affair with @entity10 because he is straight and was married to an @entity7 woman named @entity25 ( left ) @entity88 : @entity8 's brother @entity89 ( left ) says that the whole case arose because @entity8 broke up with @entity25 ( right ) and she was upset so she made up the claims and reported them to the police @entity8 and his mother claimed they had married for love but after a trial both have now been found guilty			1
a spokesman for the @entity7 district attorney ’s @entity101 @entity42 said : ‘ the defendant ’s ( @entity102 ) conduct during the investigation far exceeded most of the other approximately 120 offenders the government has prosecuted over the past five years			0
‘ this defendant was the only one to enter into three distinct marriage frauds			0
‘ this defendant was particularly hard on his spouses and his girlfriends who were smart enough not to marry him			0
‘ this defendant made fraudulent filings and set up a fraudulent marriage with his mother			2
’ out of character : friends of @entity21 , who had a job as a @entity5 teacher at a local high school , say she is a very honest person and she never would have made up a marriage neither mr @entity122 , who is originally from the @entity123 , or @entity124 have been charged			1
in a statement to @entity126 , she said : ‘ those who know me and care for me know what the truth is			0
‘ those who do n’t , i ’m unconcerned what they think they know about me			0
‘ until they have walked a mile in my shoes they can not begin to know anything about me and my life			0
do what you feel is best			0
i have certainly in my life , in every aspect of it			0
’ another casualty of the plot is @entity8 ’s younger brother @entity89 who is currently living in the @entity7 but now faces being deported back to @entity26			1
asked if he thought his mother ’s marriage was fake , he said : ‘ no , 100 percent			0
@entity10 is my family ’			1
he added that he wanted to join the military but now faces being sent home to a country he had not been to for 10 years with no family and no money			0

@entity5 national @entity15 married @entity10
prosecutors allege @entity10 was in a secret relationship with her son @entity8
@entity8 claims his jealous ex-wife made up the allegations
