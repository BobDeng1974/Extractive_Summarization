@entity13 's heartbreaking living conditions were revealed during september hearings into how the 18 - year - old 's case was handled by the @entity64 before her death			1
a @entity64 case worker and employees from @entity68 , which provides care to patients with special needs , had visited the teen at her parents ' home in @entity1 just six days before she died			1
@entity76 judge @entity75 held hearings in the fall to see if staff had falsified positive reviews of the girl 's living conditions , the @entity59 reported			1

instead , there was a ' negligent oversight , if not reckless disregard , of the conditions of the home ' , she said			2

neither have been charged - and it is not known if they knew about the sores on the girl 's legs - but police are investigating the @entity64 case worker , @entity103 , said she was shocked when she learned about the conditions because when she visited six days earlier , the home was in good condition and the girl had smiled			1

she also learned that @entity13 had sores below her waist			2
at the hearing , she admitted she had only checked some rooms in the house and did not check the @entity13 's legs for sores			1

@entity129 said that she had been handling up to 28 cases at the time , whereas the legal limit in @entity30 is 17			0
she explained that she was unable to keep up and could not sleep at night			0
but the @entity64 , which fired @entity129 and her supervisor after @entity13 passed away , said that workload was not a valid excuse for the oversights , and that the visits should have been carried out more thoroughly			1
