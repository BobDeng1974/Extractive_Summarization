twelve struggling towns offered help from tv guru @entity3 to save their high streets still have fewer shops than two years ago , it emerged today			1
the businesswoman and presenter was hired by the government to turn around town centres in places like @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , with a share of a £ 1.2million fund			2
but two years on , there are still 53 fewer shops in their dozen towns than before the project started , with @entity20 claiming it is ' politically embarrassing ' for the government			1
the loss of big names like @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 from many high streets was accompanied by the rise of charity and betting shops			1
in 2012 , @entity3 was appointed by the government to bring about a revival in areas worst affected by the economic downturn and the rise of out - of - town shopping centres			1
the first 12 @entity52 towns were @entity11 in @entity53 , @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity12 in @entity56 , @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity13 in @entity56 , @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 on @entity70 in @entity71 and @entity72 in the @entity73			2
they were promised an injection of life , with more markets , better branding and pop - up shops			0
ideas included ‘ guerilla gardening ’ , street art , town criers and bicycle rickshaw services			0
however , many of her main recommendations including free parking and cheaper business rates were not taken up by ministers			1
after a year of the project , the total number of shops in the first 12 @entity52 towns had fallen by 95			2
new research by the @entity95 shows things are improving , but are still not back to the level seen in 2012			0
in the last 12 months , there has been a net increase of 42 in the number of shops in the first pilot areas , according to research commissioned by @entity104 ’s you and yours programme			1
this means the number of shops is still 53 lower than it was two years ago			2
in the first 12 @entity52 towns , there are still 52 fewer shops than there were two years ago			1
the towns are @entity11 in @entity53 , @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity12 in @entity56 , @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity13 in @entity56 , @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 on @entity70 in @entity71 and @entity72 in the @entity73			0
@entity20 mp @entity115 , chairman of the business select committee , told the @entity104 : ‘ the response was inadequate to actually transform the fortunes of the high streets in those selected areas			1
now , you would normally expect the government when they have introduced pilot schemes to have some process for assessing how they have worked , then doing a report and then making recommendations arising from the evidence that they have got there			0
‘ none of that appears to have taken place			0
‘ so i think the inevitable conclusion you can draw is this was really a political response to the @entity139 recommendations and is now being exposed as not delivering and potentially politically embarrassing to the government			0
’ the government argues that across the country shop vacancy rates are down to their lowest level since 2010 , at 13.4 per cent in june			0
high streets minister @entity144 insisted @entity3 and @entity145 are ‘ helping to drive the local economy , boost business and adopt shopper - friendly parking policies ’			1
she added : ‘ the main aim of the scheme has always been to harness the energy and enthusiasm of the local community and give them the freedom to try out their ideas			0
this is a long term project , but pilots are already showing what is possible			0
‘ from @entity63 getting empty shops back into use to @entity162 developing 10p parking initiatives			2
‘ the government ’s long term economic plan is supporting high streets			1
we have provided over £ 1 billion of business rates support which includes the doubling of small business rate relief and a reoccupation discount of 50 per cent for businesses taking on long - term empty shops			0
