it 's just not sensible to be out and about in those conditions			0
‘ [ that is ] even with a harness and life line , especially when the rock is wet and slippery , so i was pod - bound for the rest of the morning and all of the rest of the day			2
‘ this meant more reading : i finished @entity37 's ' decoded ' and started @entity38 ( @entity39 ) @entity41 's autobiography , before completing some more harmonica lessons			2
‘ the basic tunes i 'm on at the moment sound to me like they 're supposed to , and there 's some basic technique work at this stage too , which seems to be going well			0

the current dispute is over the wider @entity12 - @entity153 basin			2
