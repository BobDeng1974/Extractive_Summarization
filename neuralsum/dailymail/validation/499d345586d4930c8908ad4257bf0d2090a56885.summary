when it comes to style , few would argue that top designer @entity2 has it in spades			2
so no surprise that the fashion guru 's former home in @entity8 , @entity9 , has a certain @entity10			0
the stylish apartment , where the @entity12 lived between 1994 and 2004 whilst heading up @entity13 , is now on the market for a cool £ 1.15m with estate agents @entity16 and @entity17 - who say having a famous former tenant is proving a big draw for the property			1
inside the apartment , where @entity2 lived between 1994 and 2004 , while heading up @entity13 the apartment located in @entity23 in @entity24 has a master bedroom , and a stunning roof terrace @entity27 apparently still arrives for the designer , pictured , from time to time the designer is now based across the pond but there are still plenty of stylish neighbours to rub designer shoulders with - @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 among them			1
arranged over two floors and flooded with light , the 900sqft apartment has a bright and airy feel			1
the apartment has been updated since the designer left more than a decade ago			1
when the current owners did refurbished the property they claim that they found a number of @entity13 material samples with handwritten notes			0
the cool apartment located in @entity23 in @entity24 has a master bedroom and en - suite , an open - plan reception room and kitchen and a stunning roof terrace			1
up the spiral staircase there 's a further bedroom and shower room and access to the roof terrace with view across the city			0
@entity66 floors and industrial style lamps and staircase give the pad a the cool factor - as does the muted colour palette			1
the 53 - year - old designer has a degree in architecture , so perhaps it 's the apartment 's stylish split - level structure that appealed			2
apparently parcels apparently still arrive for the designer from time to time - so you never know what unexpected extras might be thrown in for the £ 1.15m price - tag			2
@entity82 , @entity83 in @entity84 , said : ' this flat is special for a number of reasons			0
