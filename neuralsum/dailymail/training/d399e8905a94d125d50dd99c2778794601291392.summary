by @entity0 published : 10:10 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 12:04 est , 25 october 2012 for @entity2 , the @entity1 was her life			1
after raised as a military kid , joining her school 's @entity5 or @entity5 and earning a full - ride @entity1 scholarship to @entity8 , enlisting to serve her country was a dream			1
what she did n't expect was that weeks before commissioned as a second lieutenant , with her own father in uniform proudly swearing her in , she 'd become pregnant			2
' i was so happy that [ my parents ] had an opportunity to come out and be a part of that ceremony and have him administer the oath of office to me as an active - duty officer , ' she said of her father , capt @entity18			0
but when sitting down for one of her final counselling sessions with an officer before her commission , it was then her excitement turned to nervousness			0
she had only just found out she was 13 weeks pregnant and no one outside of her immediate family and her boyfriend knew			2
fearful : with the military having been in her life from the start , following in her father 's footsteps before joining @entity5 , as seen centre , ms @entity2 was scared to tell others of her pregnancy for fear of it ruining her dreams uncertainty : when an officer allegedly warned that if she became pregnant it would end badly , she said she felt trapped , though already knew she would never have an abortion shock : ms @entity2 says she was shocked to hear that she had three options of getting married , giving her child to adoption or having an abortion , the last option she said only dictated in private to her ' he says , " i do n't know what would happen to a cadet if she were to become pregnant			1
but i do n't think it would be good			0
so just do n't get pregnant , " ' ms @entity2 recalled of their conversation			1
' he said that word for word to me			0
at that point , i thought , " ok , i do n't think i have to tell anybody this , ” she said , describing herself from then on rather ' scared			0
' - ms @entity87 of her officer moving forward , ms @entity2 said she completed all of her physical and academic requirements			2
being a @entity91 , she said abortion was never an option for her			0
instead she began planning her move to @entity94 to begin her service			0
once six months in , however , she felt she had to tell someone			0
with her news , first expressed as no issue by her immediate commanders , she was accused of committing fraud for having not reported changes in her medical status , ' for example , pregnancy , ' as her @entity5 contract signed in 2007 read			1
kicked out : six months into her pregnancy with this little boy , ms @entity2 revealed her news to her officers in effect dis - enrolling her while accusing her of fraud for having not reported it before fighting : ms @entity2 , seen today holding her 10 - month - old boy beside her boyfriend , says that she is fighting her removal under a military rule that refuses to enlist single mothers claiming to have questioned her officer who warned her of her ejection from the @entity1 , she asked : ' had i terminated the pregnancy before my commissioning , would i have been able to commission at that point ? ' according to ms @entity2 : ' he said , " well , technically , yes			1
" a spokesman for the @entity1 to @entity29 denied knowing of that conversation taking place			2
' any such counselling would have been inappropriate and i have seen no evidence of any such discussion , ' maj. @entity127 wrote to @entity29			0
' however , ms. @entity2 ' case is under review by the @entity133			2
' debt to pay : now having a $ 92,000 debt from student loans , her @entity1 scholarship taken away , ms @entity2 works as a pediatric nurse appealing to her congressman and hiring an attorney , ms @entity2 learned that if she were n't a single mother before her commissioning , the @entity1 's decision would have been far more lenient toward her			1
as military readiness goes , single parents do n't have flexibility to serve in all times of need , they stated			1
' ... she would have been able to commission if she were not a single parent , for example , if she were married , or had given the child up for adoption , ' air force colonel @entity152 wrote to ms @entity2 ' congressman			1
needed at home : the @entity1 has said that single moms are not eligible for enrollment because of their inability to be ready in time of need mistake : she says that having her son @entity163 , pictured , was never a mistake but hopes the military soon realizes that they are making one themselves today , working as a paediatric nurse , ms @entity2 owes the military $ 92,000 for her tuition but says she 's paying it in increments of $ 100 a month , with interest			1
while the @entity1 had been her life before , and to a large degree still is , she says it 's now her 10 - month old son , @entity163 whom she says was never a mistake			0
still though she hopes like the recent changes allowing openly gay men and women to serve in the @entity183 military , change will come or even be considered for her one day			0
‘ i believe a woman has the right to choose life , go on to serve and reach [ her ] full potential , including being an officer in the @entity1 , ’ ms @entity2 told @entity29			1
