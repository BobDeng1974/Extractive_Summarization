by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 returned for their first pre-season training session on saturday as new boss @entity4 got a first chance to work with his players			2
with several members of the squad still away on international duty at the @entity11 , the remainder were put through their paces by the former @entity14 manager			2
my way : @entity4 has a reputation for enforcing a heavy training workload during pre-season on the run : @entity2 players including @entity22 ( centre ) and @entity24 ( left ) start training although the likes of @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 were still out in @entity31 there were still some big names for @entity4 to have a look at , including record signing @entity34			1
the former @entity14 and @entity36 manager had previously warned his new charges not worry despite having a reputation for enforcing double training sessions in pre-season			0
@entity4 , who led @entity14 to eighth place last season , will be expected to qualify for the @entity43 with @entity2 , who could only manage sixth under previous boss @entity45			0
getting to know you : it was the first chance for the new manager to evaluate his players at @entity2 fitness : the @entity2 players not in @entity31 prepare for a season playing @entity4 's high pressing game depleted : the squad is still missing the likes of @entity28 and @entity30 who are at the @entity11 he is the club 's third manager in the last two seasons after they also got rid of @entity59 last year			1
the @entity60 moved to @entity61 after 18 months at @entity62 's , where he notably oversaw the development of young defenders @entity65 and @entity66 .			0

new manager starts work with his squad
stars including *keeper* @entity28 have not yet arrived back from @entity31
but likes of @entity34 and @entity22 begin life under @entity4
