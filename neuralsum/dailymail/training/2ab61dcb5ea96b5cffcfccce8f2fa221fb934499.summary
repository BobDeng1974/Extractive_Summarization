by @entity0 published : 10:19 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 11:03 est , 2 april 2013 when pregnant @entity3 ’s bump suddenly started growing much faster than expected , worried doctors carried out a scan to find the cause			1
what they discovered was a huge ovarian cyst – growing on the ovary not of the mother - to - be , but of her unborn daughter			1
and as well as putting increasing pressure on the baby ’s vital organs , if it burst the little girl could suffer serious complications			1
mrs @entity3 had to have an emergency caesarean to deliver her daughter , so she could then undergo a life - saving operation			1
@entity3 had a scan when her baby bump started to grow much more quickly than expected			1
she is pictured with baby @entity21 and husband , @entity23 the scan showed that @entity21 had an ovarian cyst which was two inches in diameter			1
the cyst is the round black area in the centre of the image @entity21 , now 23 - months - old , has made a complete recovery and is at home with her parents in @entity34 , @entity35			1
mrs @entity3 , 26 , a pharmacist , said : ‘ the scan saved @entity21 ’s life			1
if the doctors had n’t carried out the scan to see why my stomach was so huge , then they might not have spotted the growth in time			2
‘ it was in the top of her stomach and growing upwards so that it was squashing her major organs			0
‘ it could have ruptured any minute whilst she was in the womb – which would have killed her			0
she is the luckiest baby in the world			0
’ the growth of mrs @entity3 ’s bump started accelerating after she went past the 30 - week mark in her pregnancy in april 2011			1
she said : ‘ when i got to 36 weeks my bump was so enormous that i looked as though i was having triplets			1
i could n’t fasten my seatbelt in the car			0
‘ my pregnancy had gone smoothly at first			0
i ’d had a bit of bleeding initially , which was a worry , but that soon stopped			0
and my scans had shown nothing was wrong			0
‘ but then after i reached 30 weeks pregnant , my bump really started to grow over the next few weeks			0
even the midwives were shocked at the size of it – they thought it was absolutely huge			0
’ @entity21 had to be delivered by emergency caesarean because the cyst was putting pressure on her vital organs and was in danger of rupturing and killing her doctors at @entity76 ’s @entity75 thought mrs @entity3 might have had excess fluid in her womb so carried out a scan			1
it was then they discovered that the baby had a mass growing in the top of her stomach			0
ovarian cysts in newborn baby girls are quite common and usually clear up on their own but @entity21 's was unusual as it was putting pressure on her organs and was in danger of rupturing			1
mrs @entity3 , who lives with husband @entity23 , 25 , an engineer , said : ‘ it was terrifying			0
the sonographer ran the scanner over my stomach and then said they could see a mass growing in the baby ’s stomach			0
‘ i had another scan to check , and at that point the doctors were n’t sure whether the mass was a tumour , a cyst or a bowel blockage			0
’ mrs @entity3 underwent an emergency caesarean to deliver @entity21 , who weighed 7lb 6oz			2
after she was born @entity21 had to have an operation to remove the cyst which turned out to be benign			1
she has now made a full recovery @entity21 had to have one of her ovaries removed but her parents have been told that it should not affect her ability to have children in the future @entity21 was immediately transferred to the @entity114 in @entity76 , where she had an operation			1
doctors discovered she had an ovarian cyst measuring nearly two inches in diameter			2
the surgeons managed to remove all of it , and @entity21 immediately lost half a pound			2
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ we were so worried about @entity21 having the operation as she was so young , only a few days old			2
‘ but we knew that the cyst could have ruptured at any moment , so we did n’t have a choice			0
when surgeons removed @entity21 's cyst she immediately lost half a pound in weight ‘ when they told us afterwards that it had been a success it was such a relief			2
’ the couple have been told that although one ovary had to be removed , it should not affect @entity21 ’s chance of having children in the future as she still has one ovary remaining			0
mrs @entity3 added : ‘ we were so amazed that a baby could even have an ovarian cyst like this			1
‘ the doctors told us it was incredibly rare but it had probably developed as she had absorbed excess hormones through me			0
’ tests showed the cyst was benign , not cancerous .			2

@entity3 , 26 , had a scan when her baby bump grew faster than expected
showed that daughter @entity21 had a two - inch ovarian cyst growing *inside* her
the growth was putting pressure on the baby 's organs and could have burst
@entity21 was born by @entity160 at 36 weeks and had surgery to remove cyst
the cyst was benign and @entity21 , now 23 - months - old , has made a full recovery
