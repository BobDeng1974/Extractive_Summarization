a number of conditions have been attached to the consent , including that the building work is started within the next three years			0
moving to the site from his present home in @entity38 , near @entity39 , @entity40 , would take mr @entity9 several miles closer to his friend , prime minister @entity41 , who lives in the nearby village of @entity43			1

there are many sensible reasons for this , ' he wrote			0

the government does n't get any of my money when i die			0
and the price of the food that i grow can only go up			0
' but there is another , much more important reason : i can now have a quad bike			0
' i have always loved the idea of such things			0
they are like motorbikes but they do n't fall over when you leave them alone , they look great and they bring a bit of civilisation to @entity130 's rather dreary green and brown bits			0
