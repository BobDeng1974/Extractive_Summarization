staff were given ‘ clear directions ’ from managers to downplay the ‘ ethnic *dimension* ’ of the abuse despite almost all the *perpetrators* being of @entity17 *heritage* ;
three separate reports *warning* of the scale of the abuse were ‘ suppressed or ignored ’ by the council because it was ‘ in denial ’ about the crimes ;
serious *discussions* about sexual abuse were *impossible* because of the ‘ macho ’ and ‘ sexist ’ culture at the @entity232 - controlled council ;
police treated victims and their families as if they were to blame for the abuse , and took no action against the *paedophiles* ;
the victims were left so traumatised that one tried to throw herself in front of moving cars and another said she ‘ might as well be dead
