she has been voted the sexiest woman alive , but now it emerges that one reason may be that @entity4 apparently has the perfect nose			2
plastic surgeons have analysed the ideal shape for a woman ’s nose and found it should be slightly upturned			1
they found @entity4 , @entity10 of @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 all fit the bill			1
plastic surgeons have analysed the ideal shape for a woman ’s nose and found it should be slightly upturned			1
measured from the lip up , the optimum angle of rotation at the nasal tip - the amount the nose is turned up - should be 106 degrees to enhance a woman ’s looks , says new research			1
a nose that is rotated less than 90 degrees to the face looks droopy , long and masculine			1
but an expert said surgeons always strive to get the perfect look for the individual , rather than sticking to a textbook formula			0
‘ there is a range of rotation that ’s usually applied , which is 90 to 100 degrees for men and 95 to 110 degrees for women – this study has ended up somewhere in - between ’ said @entity37 of the @entity38			1

a nose that is rotated less than 90 degrees to the face looks droopy , long and masculine			1
@entity53 plastic surgeons behind the research claim there has been no universally accepted standard that defines the most aesthetic combination of nasal features until now			0
dr @entity59 , of @entity60 , said attempts to capture the ideal shape have been ‘ elusive and ongoing for decades			1
’ he said : ‘ throughout history artists and scholars have been engrossed in the pursuit of capturing what constitutes beauty			0
‘ dating back to ancient @entity69 artists idealised facial proportions in their works			0
’ in a bid to ‘ design ’ the most beautiful nose for a young woman , the researchers tested public reaction to a range of different angles and rotation			1
they used digital portraits of young white women aged 18 to 25 years , which were ranked online by almost 4,000 men and women drawn from the same age group			0
they were asked to compare photos of women with noses 96 , 101 , 106 , 111 and 116 degrees to their face			0
the study used focus group and online social network participants and 106 degrees is consistent with previous research stipulating 104 and 108 degrees as being highly favourable angles			2
dr @entity59 said ‘ to our knowledge this is the first population - based study to attempt to simultaneously determine the ideal @entity104 - nasal tip projection - and rotation			1
a rotation of 106 degrees was found to be the most aesthetic			2
’ @entity37 , of the @entity38 , one of the most experienced and sought after specialists in rhinoplasty , or nose jobs , said there were classical features involved in creating the perfect nose			2
he said the study ’s verdict meant the slightly upturned nose of @entity53 actress @entity4 – hailed for performances in @entity116 and @entity117 – had the ideal shape			2
mr @entity37 does get asked by patients to replicate ms @entity4 ’s nose , ‘ but the commonest request is to look like @entity122 ’			2
however , he says surgeons always strive to get the perfect look for the individual , rather than sticking to a textbook formula			0
how to work out if you have the perfect nose : the team used three measurements , known as the @entity130 1 , @entity131 2 , and @entity133 measurements ( shown here as a , b and c ) to work out the anglt of the nose			0
an upturn of 106 ° was found to be the most aesthetic			0
‘ there is a range of rotation that ’s usually applied , which is 90 to 100 degrees for men and 95 to 110 degrees for women – this study has ended up somewhere in - between ’ he said			1
‘ in the past there was a stigma attached to having surgery on the nose , largely because they all ended up looking the same			0
‘ today we are making a nose that is best for that face , so people compliment them on their lovely smile or beautiful eyes as the face as a whole looks good			0
the angle of the nose is only one of the variants used in a personalised approach , ’ he added			0
the study , published online in @entity168 journal looked only at young white women and researchers said the finding was not necessarily applicable to men , or other ethnicities .			0

@entity10 of @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 all have ' perfect ' noses according to the study
measured from the lip up , the optimum angle of rotation at the nasal tip should be 106 degrees to enhance a woman ’s looks , new research claims
a nose that is rotated less than 90 degrees looks long and masculine
dr @entity59 , of @entity60 , said attempts to capture the ideal shape have been ‘ elusive and ongoing for decades ’
researchers tested public reaction to a range of different angles and rotation to *identify* the ' perfect ' nose
