@entity1 star @entity0 has described it as ' sad ' that his @entity4 - winning colleague @entity3 is unable to flourish on the international stage			1
@entity3 won the last of his five @entity8 caps in 2010 when he played for @entity9			1
he joined @entity1 a year later and has subsequently not been involved with @entity8 as the @entity10 holds a strict policy of not selecting overseas - based players unless there are ' exceptional circumstances '			1
it appears unlikely , though , that the 28 - year - old flanker will be involved in next month 's demanding three - @entity28 series against world champions @entity30			2
' @entity33 has really been phenomenal , and it is sad that because of where he plays he is not going to go on and achieve high honours , ' @entity1 and @entity32 wing @entity0 said			1
' he gets vital turnovers that get the scoreboard ticking - three , six , nine points - and our team thrives on that			2
he is a crucial part of the team			2
' he has put his hand up this whole season			2
people write him off at their own peril			2
he has been absolutely wonderful - he can dominate games			2
impressive : @entity15 was in the crowd as @entity3 starred for @entity1 on saturday at @entity51 ' as a player , you understand the commitments the countries need to grow their own game and you understand their logic			1
you respect the decisions made by the administrators			2
' the decision is out of our hands , but i think a guy like @entity3 , with the season he has had , probably deserves to be playing international rugby			1
he is a great team man			0
' while @entity3 made the final 's dominant individual contribution along with centre @entity70 , it was @entity1 skipper @entity72 who inevitably took centre - stage in his last appearance on @entity76 soil before retirement			1
@entity8 @entity78 winner @entity72 will bow out of the game after next weekend 's @entity81 top 14 final against @entity82 in @entity83 , and he kicked 13 points as @entity1 became only the third team after @entity86 and @entity87 to successfully defend @entity22 rugby 's major club crown			1
' @entity72 is a once - in - a - career , once - in - a - lifetime player , ' @entity0 added			0
' you look at sporting greats , and he will probably rank up there with some of the greats in any formula of athletic ability			0
' it 's never going to be nice saying goodbye to him			0
he has had an impeccable career , and the humility he has shown , the way he puts work ethic into a whole different category has been outstanding			0
outcast : @entity3 last played for @entity8 in 2010 , but has n't been eligible since his move to @entity81 ' i do n't think he will ever be able to be replaced			1
there is only going to be one @entity72 , only one guy who has achieved what he has			0
' we are going to miss @entity72 , what he brings to the team , what he brings to the whole environment			0
how he lifts the whole team and whole city is something immense			0
' even without @entity72 next season , it is difficult to envisage @entity1 not featuring prominently in the new @entity119 , such is their all - round strength , quality and character			1
' four months ago after we lost to @entity125 ( in the @entity126 ) everyone had sort of written us off , but the character and leadership shown in this team from people like @entity72 , @entity70 and @entity131 is outstanding , ' @entity0 said			0
' people throw it out about players going to @entity1 to retire and for the money			1
people call us mercenaries , but i see the work ethic of the guys , the work that gets put in on the training pitch and in the gym			0
' but over and above it , there is the team spirit , the vibe in the playing group and the ability to overcome a disappointing mid-point of the season			0
' when you are involved in a team where the guy next to you is willing to go that extra yard , not for himself , but for the jersey and his team - mate , it makes it really special			0
' it has been a massive honour for me to go to @entity1			1
winning the @entity4 final was the first step , and there is another big one for us next week			0

@entity8 head coach @entity15 recently met with @entity1 flanker @entity3
