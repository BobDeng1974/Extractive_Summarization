you know , when @entity2 is getting back to work , it can only mean one thing – the @entity5 are back in government			1
’ the prime minister said the @entity76 aimed to ensure the highest employment rate of any major economy so that all those who ‘ can work are able to work ’			2
‘ standing on their own two feet , looking at their children and thinking “ i am providing for you ”			0
we can get there – but only if we stick to our plan			0
‘ companies are coming from all over the world to invest and create jobs here			0
that ’s not happened by accident			2
‘ it ’s because they see a government rolling out the red carpet for them , cutting their red tape , cutting their taxes			2

lower than @entity37 , lower than @entity105 , lower than the @entity106			0
’ chancellor @entity16 listens as mr @entity0 gives his keynote speech to the @entity5 - the last time he speaks to such a large gathering of the party faithful before the general election home secretary @entity111 watches a video prior to mr @entity0 's speech @entity114 was moved to tears as her husband paid tribute to the @entity118 for the care it gave their late son @entity120			2

firms including @entity162 and @entity163 have been accused of adopting the tactic			0
mr @entity0 said he had a ‘ message to those global companies : we have cut your taxes – now you must pay what you owe ’			0
@entity171 , director general of the @entity172 , said : ‘ keeping corporation tax at the lowest level in the @entity15 is a powerful and tangible commitment to promoting @entity2 as a place to do business			1
‘ however , whilst it ’s also right that companies operating here pay their fair share of tax , clamping down on egregious tax avoidance must coincide with a radical simplification of the tax code			1
taxes must be simpler , as well as lower			0
’ @entity186 , head of the @entity187 , said : ‘ we need more investment to create more jobs , so pledging to keep the @entity2 corporate tax rate the most competitive in the @entity15 will send out a clear positive signal to businesses			1
