a budget - busting bride has bagged herself a £ 21,000 wedding of her dreams - but only had to spend £ 2,000 for it			0
savvy saver @entity5 , 32 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , was determined to have a lavish wedding but without the extortionate price tag so set about saving , making and borrowing for her dream day			1
beautiful bride @entity5 shunned a traditional horse and carriage - which can cost upwards of £ 1000 - for a £ 10 taxi to the church , and the entire wedding party then walked from the church to the reception			1
@entity5 was delighted when long - term partner 31 - year - old @entity20 proposed - but she was adamant that she would n’t be spending the £ 21,427 average price tag to achieve her dream wedding			1
@entity5 said : ' @entity20 and i have been together for ten years and have two young children and we had n’t previously managed to find the time or money to get married			2
' for us the marriage was the important part not spending thousands on a wedding , and we did n’t want to be in debt for four or five years trying to pay off one day			0
