by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 15:03 est , 5 april 2013 prince @entity1 was back to his devilish best as he joked with an 83 - year - old factory worker about her talent for ' stripping '			1
the queen ’s 91 - year - old husband proved he still has a twinkle in his eye as he indulged in a string of double entendres with @entity11 , who has worked at the at the @entity13 factory in @entity14 for 69 years			1
mrs @entity11 explained that when she first joined as a 14 - year - old girl in 1944 she was employed in the stripping department where the original @entity13 bars were cut by hand			1
the @entity1 indulged in some typically risqué banter about stripping while visiting the @entity13 factory happy : the @entity6 looked radiant in a striking purple coat as she received flowers from well - wishers outside ' stripping department ? that ’s @entity13 bars ? ' @entity1 enquired			1
' i thought it was something else ! ' undeterred the factory ’s longest - serving staff member told him innocently : ' it was all done by hand then			1
' to which the flirty nonagenarian replied : ' well , most stripping is done by hand			1
' fortunately he managed to spend the rest of the morning visit engaged in slightly less risqué conversation			1
the @entity1 is fond of bantering with well - wishers and last year got into a spot of bother when he spied upon pretty council worker @entity46 , 25 , on a jubilee visit with his wife to @entity49 in @entity50			1
the elderly royal turned to the policeman standing next to her and gestured towards her eye - catching red dress which had a zip running the length of its front			1
' i would get arrested if i unzipped that dress ! ' he exclaimed			1
at the time , his comments were widely greeted as yet another ' gaffe ' , for which the @entity1 has become notorious			1
most recently , the @entity1 hit the headlines when he told a @entity67 nurse that her country must be ' half empty as you 're all here running the @entity72 ' while on a visit to a @entity75 hospital			1
@entity76 and hearty : both the @entity1 and the @entity6 were on top form and looked in good health community : the @entity6 and prince @entity80 also unveiled a plaque at @entity14 's @entity83 community centre gift : a smiling queen is handed a pink rose by a little girl during her visit to @entity14 's @entity83 community centre greatest hits include asking an @entity90 driving instructor how he managed to keep locals off the booze long enough to pass the test , and telling the president of @entity96 that his traditional robes made him look ready for bed			1
@entity80 made his latest remarks during a tour of the @entity13 factory in @entity102 , home to the eponymous @entity13 , snickers and other delights , with the @entity6			1
before they left the @entity6 was presented with a remarkable edible carriage - a replica of the @entity113 state coach - made from chocolate , sugar and 24 - carat gold leaf			1
@entity13 ' president , @entity114 , told the monarch : ' it 's the first time we 've had gold leaf in one of our products			1
i hope it does n't take off otherwise it might be expensive to make			2
' the @entity6 appeared pleased with her gift which also featured an edible painting of @entity128 complete with a gold frame and two @entity130 dressed as guardsmen standing to attention in chocolate sentry boxes , complete with bearskins , guarding the rear of the picture			2
as she stepped forward for a closer look , the monarch said : ' yes , very clever , it 's rather detailed is n't it ? ' the @entity6 pointed out the 7lb chocolate carriage , which took two weeks to make and will last for about a month ( not that it is likely to hang around that long ) to @entity1 who said to miss @entity114 : ' you expect it to be eaten or kept ? ' banter : the @entity1 and the @entity6 chat to locals at the @entity148 in @entity14 treats : the @entity6 inspects a stack of freshly made confectionery during a visit to the @entity13 factory in @entity14 ' you look like you ’re ready for bed ! ' to the president of @entity96 , who was wearing traditional robes			1
' ah , so this is feminist corner then			2

' to the matron of a hospital in the @entity168			2

' how do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test ? ' to a @entity180 driving instructor in 1995			2
' what do you gargle with — pebbles ? ' to @entity183 , after the @entity184 , 1969			2
he later added : ' it is very difficult at all to see how it is possible to become immensely valuable by singing what i think are the most hideous songs			2
' ' you managed not to get eaten then ? ' to a @entity191 student who was trekking in @entity192 , during an official visit in 1998			0
' i would like to go to @entity195 very much — although the bastards murdered half my family			0
