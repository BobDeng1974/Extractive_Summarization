hackers brought down several public @entity2 websites in what appears to be the latest escalation in cyberspace over growing tensions over @entity7			1
the @entity10 military alliance 's spokeswoman , @entity8 , said on @entity11 that the cyber attacks , which began on saturday evening , continued on sunday , although most services were eventually restored			1
' it does n't impede our ability to command and control our forces			0
at no time was there any risk to our classified networks , ' another @entity2 official said			0
@entity2 's main public website ( www.nato.int ) , which carried a statement by secretary - general @entity25 saying that sunday 's referendum on @entity7 's status would violate international law and lack legitimacy , worked intermittently			0
several @entity2 websites have been hit by cyber attacks , but they have had no impact on the military alliance ¿ s operations , a spokeswoman said , despite being shut down for several hours at the weekend a group of ' @entity38 patriots ' calling itself ¿ cyber berkut ¿ - after the old regime ¿ s feared riot squad - says it targeted the @entity2 sites for ¿ interference ¿ in their country ¿ s affairs the hacktivist group , @entity48 , said that it took down @entity2 's primary website and the website of its cyber defense center in a post on their own website ( pictured ) the so - called ' distributed denial of service ' ( @entity58 ) attack , in which hackers bombard websites with requests causing them to slow down or crash , also hit the site of a @entity2 - affiliated cyber security center in @entity65			1
@entity2 's unclassified e-mail network was also affected			0
a group calling itself ' cyber berkut ' said the attack had been carried out by patriotic @entity38 angry over what they saw as @entity2 interference in their country			1
the claim , made at @entity75 , could not be independently verified			0
' @entity48 ' is a reference to the feared and since disbanded riot squads used by the government of ousted pro-russian @entity38 president @entity79			2
cyber warfare expert @entity82 , in a blog on the attacks , described cyber berkut as staunch supporters of @entity79 and a ' pro-russia hacktivist group working against @entity38 independence '			1
@entity8 noted the statement by ' a group of hacktivists ' but said that , due to the complexities involved in attributing the attacks , @entity2 would not speculate about who was responsible or their motives			2
cyberattacks from both sides have escalated over the prior weeks , as @entity7 ¿ a @entity38 peninsula bordering @entity97 that 's about the size of @entity100 ¿ approaches a vote tomorrow over secession , which is expected to end in the region joining @entity97 @entity104 , chief technology officer at the @entity105 , a non-profit research institute , said initial evidence strongly suggested that these cyber attacks were launched by @entity109 sympathisers			1
' one could equate these cyber attacks against @entity2 as kicking sand into one 's face , ' he said			1
cyber attacks on @entity2 's computer systems are common , but a @entity2 official , speaking on condition of anonymity on sunday , said this was a serious online assault			1
@entity121 , director of @entity2 's cyber defense nerve center at @entity123 in southern @entity124 , said last year that the alliance 's network intrusion detection systems handled around 147 million ' suspicious events ' every day and around 2,500 confirmed serious attacks on its computers in the previous year			2
occupied by @entity97 forces for two weeks , the largely @entity97 - speaking @entity7 holds a referendum on seceding from @entity38 to join @entity97 on sunday			2
@entity2 states have opposed the move , calling it unconstitutional and effectively an annexation of @entity38 's sovereign territory			0
tensions between @entity138 and the @entity139 have been rising steadily since @entity97 intervened following the ouster of @entity79			0
@entity38 and @entity97 websites have both been targets for cyber attacks in recent weeks but this appeared the first major attack on a @entity10 website since the crisis began			1
suspected @entity97 hackers used @entity58 attacks to cripple websites and services in @entity65 in 2007 during a dispute over a war memorial , and against @entity154 during its brief 2008 war with @entity97			0
@entity138 denied orchestrating such attacks , saying they were simply carried out by independent patriots			0
groups calling themselves cyber berkut have attacked several @entity38 websites in recent weeks , computer security experts say			0
cyber berkut - which some experts believe may be affiliated with @entity97 intelligence - published its statement in @entity97 rather than @entity38 .			2

@entity38 hacktivist group claiming *responsibility* for bringing down several public @entity2 sites at the weekend

a secession vote tomorrow will *determine* whether @entity179 will be handed over to @entity97
cyber attacks from both sides have escalated over the last few weeks as the crisis in the area continues
