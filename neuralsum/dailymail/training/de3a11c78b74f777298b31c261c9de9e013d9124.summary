the photographs , which include breathtaking glaciers and azure blue bays , were released to celebrate the beauty of the @entity13 over the past 12 months			1
however , 2013 was also an eventful year and the astronauts took unique shots of erupting volcanoes and the super typhoon @entity18 , which was responsible for thousands of deaths and devastation in the @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 last month			1
beauty of the night : this image of @entity13 was captured at night			2
it was taken on 19 july and shows the cities of @entity29 and the @entity30 illuminated by moonlight among the photos was an image of @entity13 captured at night			2

another photograph captured smoke over @entity39 , from the @entity41 complex fire that affected large areas of the @entity43 and @entity44			2
last month , astronauts managed to photograph the smouldering @entity47 volcano , which was seen erupting in the @entity49 archipelago east of @entity50			1
@entity47 is a volcanic island around 31 miles wide and is the fifth largest island in the region			0
the summit at the centre of the @entity47 is covered by a caldera , a cauldron - like volcanic feature that is formed when land collapses following an eruption			0
with the exception of human settlements , the rest of the island is covered by thick jungle , as seen in the @entity8 image			1

the @entity71 is an estuary that separates the mainland coastline of the state of @entity68 , @entity50 from neighbouring @entity74			1
the mainland side of the @entity71 includes the city of @entity67 , top centre this image captures the smouldering @entity47 volcano , which was seen erupting in the @entity49 archipelago east of @entity50 on 2 december			1

with the exception of human settlements , the rest of the island is covered by thick jungle as well as more dramatic natural and environmental events over the past year , the astronauts also captured the natural beauty of @entity13			1
@entity67 in @entity68 , @entity50 , for example , was captured by astronauts on board the @entity100 on 3 august			1
the image features the @entity71 - an estuary that separates the mainland coastline of the state of @entity68 , @entity50 from neighbouring @entity74			1

an image of @entity107 and glaciers in @entity109 was captured in october			1
@entity3 astronaut @entity110 said of the sights : ' when you see the ice fields of @entity115 from space you are changed forever			0

' the lake is the deepest in the @entity124 and has a maximum depth of 836 metres			0
its milky light - blue colour is created by rock flour suspended in the lake 's waters and it is found near the @entity131 here , tropical cyclone @entity18 is pictured as it raged over the @entity22 in november			1
the typhoon battered the country with winds up to 199mph			2
at times the storm was said to have stretched 372 miles across			0
according to @entity140 officials , approximately 11million people were affected by the storms and many people in the regions of @entity144 , particularly on @entity145 and @entity146 , were left homeless the lake is the deepest in the @entity124 and has a maximum depth of 836 metres			0

the @entity165 was one of the four largest lakes in the world with an area of 68,000 square kilometres			0
however , by 2007 it had declined to 10 per cent of its original size , splitting into four lakes including one smaller lake , pictured in another shot , delicate white clouds are captured as they float across @entity178 's landscape			1
the @entity180 desert runs along the coast and rain in the area is rare			0
in the winter months the region sees hardly any cloud cover , except for the deep south where winter rains occur only once every couple of years			0
the @entity190 river was also captured by the iss. it is shown winding through the landscape of @entity193 and the entire river follows a boomerang shape			2
the river 's source is just inland from the @entity198 , but the river runs away from the sea into the @entity201			2
it then takes a sharp right turn near the ancient city of @entity205 before heading southeast to the @entity206 astronauts have used hand - held cameras to photograph the @entity13 for more than 40 years , beginning with the @entity210 missions in the early 1960s			2
digital cameras were introduced on shuttle missions in 1995 and today all @entity214 ( ceo ) imagery is taken with a digital camera			0
the average stay on the @entity8 is around six months , giving the astronauts plenty of time to hone their photography skills			1

here , sunlight can be seen reflected off irrigated farmland in @entity253 , making the landscape almost look a little like a giant microchip			1

astronauts onboard the @entity8 captured the year 's most dramatic natural events
these included erupting volcanoes on the @entity49 archipelago east of @entity50 and the super typhoon @entity18
they also captured beautiful images of the planet , from glaciers to azure blue bays and even irrigated farmland
