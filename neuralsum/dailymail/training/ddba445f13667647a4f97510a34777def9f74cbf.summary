the massive horns of @entity2 evolved over more than a million years , a study shows			1
a study of 50 skulls dug up at the @entity5 - a famous fossil site in @entity8 - found the beast underwent change over a very long period of time			1
older fossils lying deeper in the rock had shorter horns than the younger specimens nearer the surface , say scientists			1
this @entity2 fossil came from the middle of the @entity5			1
it is displayed at @entity21 's @entity20			0
older fossils lying deeper in the rock had shorter horns than the younger specimens nearer the surface , say scientists			1
by recording precise stratigraphic information for each @entity2 , and analyzing the morphological details of the skull , it appears possible to see evolutionary trends in @entity2 , the researchers said			0
over one to two million years at the end of the @entity32 , @entity2 went from having a small nasal horn and long beak to having a long nasal horn and shorter beak			1
the dinosaur with a small nasal horn and long beak is a @entity2			0
it was only found lower in the @entity5			1
the dinosaur with a long nasal horn and shorter beak is a @entity2			1
it was only found near the top of the @entity5			1
skulls found in the middle of the @entity5 showed characteristics of both @entity2 and triceratops prorsus			1
the findings published in @entity48 suggest triceratops horridus took between one and two million years to evolve into triceratops prorsus			0
in the past it was believed the two species might have existed at the same time			0
triceratops , which lived 65 million years ago , was a giant plant - eating creature best known for its great bony head frill and three horns - one above each eye and a small stubby one above its beak - like mouth			1
an adult could grow to about 30ft long and weigh five tons			0
dr @entity63 , of the @entity20 , and colleagues said : ' the placement of over 50 skulls of the well - known horned dinosaur @entity65 within a stratigraphic framework for the @entity70 reveals the evolutionary transformation of this genus			1
' triceratops - @entity74 for 3 - horned face - has been described as a reptilian knight that carried two lances and a shield on top of its enormous head			0
a @entity84 prorsus fossil came from the top of the @entity5			1
it has a long nasal horn and shorter beak is a @entity2			2
the horns grew up to 3 feet long and the forward curvature marked their owners as sexually mature			2
the bony frill changed with age as well			0
in juveniles the edge was adorned with triangular bones resembling arrowheads			0
these flattened as the animal got older and were barely visible in adults			2
it had a huge , barrel - like body and short tail			0
it ’s believed @entity2 used its horns as weapons against predators like @entity108 and also for mate attraction - much like colourful feathers in birds			2
some @entity2 specimens show healed wounds in their skull or frill - showing they fought among themselves			2
they may have fought over females , territory or leadership			0
this image shows the evolution of the @entity2 in the @entity5 of @entity8 it had a very long and powerful beak			1
each jaw had closely packed teeth with a broad grinding surface			0
with its scissor - like beak and grinding teeth @entity2 was able to bite off and chew even the toughest plants			0
dr @entity63 said : ' our research indicates the currently recognised species of @entity137 - @entity136 and @entity2 - are stratigraphically separated and the evolution of this genus likely incorporated transformational change			0
' these findings impact interpretations of dinosaur diversity at the end of the @entity32 and illuminate potential modes of evolution in the @entity146			0
' over the course of the project , the researchers found that @entity2 is the most common dinosaur in the @entity5			1
the @entity20 now houses one of the largest collections of @entity2 in the world			0
' most dinosaurs are only known from one or a handful of specimens , ' @entity154 said			2
' some dinosaurs are known from a large number of specimens , but they ’re often found all in one place – on a single stratigraphic horizon			2
' the great thing about @entity2 is that there are a lot of them , and they were found at different levels of the @entity5			1
' the new study finds evidence that not only did @entity2 change shape over the lifetime of an individual , but that the genus transformed over the course of the end of the age of dinosaurs			2

study of 50 skulls were dug up at the @entity5 in @entity8
older fossils lying deeper in the rock had shorter horns than the younger specimens
