events reached their climax on christmas eve last year after several months of incidents when @entity7 , a director of a highways construction firm , lunged at retired company director mr @entity16 , 67 , as he was repairing a gate between the two properties			1
on @entity24 played in court @entity7 could be heard to shout , ' you put your hands on me once more and you 'll be dead - and i mean dead ' , in between a torrent of foul language			1
mr @entity16 - who has lived in his property with his wife since 1986 - was then punched and hurled over the fence where he was left battered and bloody			1
all he can be heard doing in retaliation is asking for mercy in ' the season of pleasantries '			2
after being convicted of two counts of assault following a trial , @entity7 escaped with just a fine , which included having to pay £ 200 in compensation to the @entity67			1
he was also fined £ 480 and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £ 48 as well as prosecution costs of £ 200 - a total of £ 928 - which he will pay in two installments over two months			2
chair of the bench @entity76 said that a restraining order would be inappropriate as it would be impossible to implement with the complainants being next - door neighbours			2
@entity7 , pictured , was convicted of two counts of assault following a trial and was handed a fine at @entity82 - which included having to pay £ 200 in compensation @entity84 , pictured , was left battered and bloody after being thrown over a garden fence by his neighbour @entity7 @entity15 and @entity16 have revealed they were terrified of @entity7 from the moment he moved into the spacious farmhouse next - door which overlooks the @entity19 in the scenic town of @entity21 , @entity22			1
@entity7 ' house is pictured left , and the @entity37 ' right he said : ' with mr @entity16 it was an ongoing assault where he was picked up and put over a fence			1
the main purpose of this sentence today is one of punishment			0
' mrs @entity84 received very minor injuries and some distress			0
mr @entity16 received cuts , bruises , a torn shirt and distress			1
' outside court @entity7 attempted to intimidate photographers and remained defiant that the events were tit - for - tat , insisting that he was the one being harassed by neighbours			1
during his earlier trial , @entity24 footage was played which showed @entity7 exploding at 4ft 7ins mrs @entity84 when she accidentally threw a hosepipe over their connecting gate on august 26 last year			1
he then unleashed a string of four - letter obscenities and thrust his head towards her face			2
she escaped with minor injury			0
mrs @entity84 , who also used to breed greyhounds , said the problems started when @entity7 began parking his car in their yard			1
she said : ' the car park or yard is quite large but it was not when we first moved in			2
so after a considerable cost to us , in the tens of thousands , we made it bigger so we had room for our cars and the cars of our staff at the time			0
' when we arrived it was just a narrow rutted lane and no two vehicles could pass each other			0
it is now considerably bigger than it was			0
so a week in i went to see him about it			0
i have before allowed neighbours to park in it			0
flash point : @entity24 footage played in court also showed the moment @entity7 , right , attacked his neighbout @entity153 , left , because she threw a hose near a connecting fence whilst showing her friend a rockery the court heard that @entity15 and @entity16 ( pictured ) were regularly on the end of four - letter tirades concerning parking , their shared garden gate and alleged dog mess ' i saw his car and thought " hang on , he has his own car on there			1
" there were also his contractor 's vehicles there everyday - two or three at any given time			1
' they were having work and construction done all the time			0
i thought , " well he has n't even asked to use the yard "			0
that is where it all started			0
' the couple also claim that before events reached a climax on @entity181 , the @entity7 ' took exception to their two dogs - @entity184 and @entity185 - and tried to open the shared gates so the dogs would run out into the road			1
at his sentencing hearing , @entity7 ' solicitor @entity189 said the defendant felt he was constantly provoked but now knew ' not to rise to it '			1
earlier , @entity7 , who has no previous convictions , said mr @entity16 had an ' obsessional ' interest in his own security - with @entity24 cameras fitted around his property and audio capture equipment installed at different locations			1
he was also said to carry around a dictation machine wherever he went			0
but the surveillance technology captured the moment @entity7 set upon @entity203 , which her husband described as ' disturbing '			1
he said : ' my wife had had a friend over and was showing her the rockery			2
she saw that they the plants needed watering and went to get the hose			0
he came storming out , apparently because my wife had shut his gate so the dogs did n't run through			2
@entity33 heard that the chaos started just days after 18 - stone @entity7 and his wife arrived at the property in april 2012 ' my wife is tiny and he just towered over her			1
he was shouting at her and then walked away and came back and head butted her			0
i feel so helpless as her husband that i was n't there and could n't have protected her			0
' i kept thinking if i was any sort of a man i would go and punch his lights out but then reality set in			0
' he is so much bigger than me , i mean he used to be a builder and combating violence with violence would not have done anyone favours			2
' my wife had a headache the next day			2
she went into a bit of a white mist			0
she did n't even dial 999 - that 's how out of sorts she was			2
' defending @entity7 - who wore dark prescription sunglasses throughout his sentencing - mr @entity189 said he was a courteous and civil person , except when he gets upset about these ' particular issues '			1
' he and his wife are in their 60s and are looking forward to retirement			2
this is a very unfortunate blemish on his character			0
he is a man who has never done anything wrong in his life			0
' if he feels provoked he should n't rise to it			0
it boils down to a man and a lady who wanted to live their lives and do n't feel they can because they are being harassed			0
' the house is very attractive and it was supposed to be peaceful but it has n't turned out like that			0
