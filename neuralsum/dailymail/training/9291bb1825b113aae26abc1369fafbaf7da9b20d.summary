a veteran who collapsed in an @entity4 hospital cafeteria , 500 yards from the emergency room , died after waiting 30 minutes for an ambulance , officials confirmed on thursday			1
officials at the hospital said it took a half an hour for the ambulance to be dispatched and take the man from one building to the other , which is about a five minute walk			1
@entity15 spokeswoman @entity14 said @entity17 personnel performed cpr until the ambulance arrived			0
a veteran who needed an ambulance after collapsing in the cafeteria of the @entity23 died after waiting 30 minutes for an ambulance she says staff followed policy in calling 911 when the man collapsed on monday			1
' our policy is under expedited review , ' @entity14 said			0
the man 's name has n't been released			0
the death comes at the @entity34 remains under scrutiny for widespread reports of long delays for treatment and medical appointments and of veterans dying while on waiting lists			0
a review last week cited ' significant and chronic system failures ' in the nation 's health system for veterans			1
the review also portrayed the struggling agency as one battling a corrosive culture of distrust , lacking in resources and ill - prepared to deal with an influx of new and older veterans with a range of medical and mental health care needs			1
the scathing report by deputy @entity58 chief of staff @entity60 said the @entity65 , the @entity15 sub agency that provides health care to about 8.8 million veterans a year , has systematically ignored warnings about its deficiencies and must be fundamentally restructured			1
acting veterans affairs secretary @entity68 speaks during a news conference at the @entity65 in @entity70 on wednesday to release the results from its @entity72 not only are veterans forced to wait for ambulances , tens of thousands more veterans than previously reported are forced to wait at least a month for medical appointments at @entity34 hospitals and clinics , according to an updated audit of 731 @entity15 medical facilities released in june			1
the updated report includes new figures showing that the wait times actually experienced at most @entity15 facilities were shorter than those on waiting lists for pending appointments			1
for instance , new patients at the @entity90 waited about an average of 44 days for an appointment in april , the new report said			0
but the average wait for pending appointments at @entity96 was 66 days			0
similar disparities in average wait times were found around the country			0
pending appointments , for example , do n't include patients who walk into a clinic and get immediate or quick treatment , @entity15 officials said			2
they also do n't reflect rescheduled appointments or those that are moved up because of openings due to cancellations			0
@entity15 officials said the two sets of data complement one another , but both are evidence that many veterans face long waits for care			1
more than 56,000 veterans were waiting more than 90 days for an initial appointment , the new report said			1
' in many communities across the country , veterans wait too long for the high quality care they 've earned and deserve , ' acting va secretary @entity68 said back in june			2
the department has reached out to 70,000 veterans to get them off waiting lists and into clinics , @entity68 said , ' but there is still much more work to be done			0
' the report released thursday showed that about 10 percent of veterans seeking medical care at @entity15 hospitals and clinics have to wait at least 30 days for an appointment			1
that 's more than double the 4 percent of veterans the government said last week were forced to endure long waits			2
@entity68 called the increase unfortunate , but said it was probably an indication that more reliable data was being reported by @entity15 schedulers , rather than a big increase in veteran wait times			0
administrators at local @entity15 medical centers questioned the results of an audit released june 9 , which looked only at pending appointments			1
the report did not match internal data on completed appointments showing waits actually were far shorter , the local officials said			0
the reliability of both sets of data is in question			0
the @entity15 is investigating widespread manipulation of appointment data by schedulers following an uproar over since - confirmed allegations that dozens of veterans died while awaiting appointments at the @entity15 medical center			2
this 2007 file photo shows @entity170 , a veteran 's facility in @entity70 some 13 percent of schedulers surveyed by the auditors reported being told by supervisors to falsify appointment records to make patient waits appear shorter			0
the @entity15 's inspector general has cited a since - abandoned performance bonus system as a reason for the falsifications , which schedulers used to mask frequent , long delays in treatment for veterans			1
@entity15 secretary @entity186 resigned three weeks ago amid an election - year firestorm over the treatment delays and waiting list problems at @entity15 facilities @entity191 took the blame for what he decried as a ' lack of integrity ' through the @entity15 network , which serves nearly 9 million veterans			2
the @entity58 and @entity199 have approved separate bills to allow more veterans who ca n't get timely va appointments to see local doctors listed instead			0
the proposals also would make it easier to fire senior @entity15 regional officials and hospital administrators			2
the june 9 audit found that more than 57,000 veterans were waiting at least 90 days for their first @entity15 medical appointments , and an additional 64,000 appeared to have fallen through the cracks , never getting appointments after enrolling for va care within the past 10 years			1
the new report said the number of veterans waiting more than 90 days dropped to about 56,300			1
about 46,400 veterans still have never gotten an appointment despite seeking one over the past decade , the report said			2
@entity68 , who replaced @entity186 may 30 , said he still is not 100 percent confident that all wait times listed on @entity15 computers — and its audits — are accurate			2
' i have vastly greater confidence in the quality ' of wait - time data being reported by @entity15 employees , he said during a speech this week in @entity70			0
' but i ca n't look at the entire database and say it 's correct either			0
