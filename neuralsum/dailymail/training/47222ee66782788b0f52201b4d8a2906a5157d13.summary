@entity0 tore into his ‘ lazy ’ @entity2 team at half - time to inspire the @entity4 to the top of the @entity6 with a 2 - 0 win over @entity8			1
@entity2 laboured in the first half against newly - promoted @entity8 before @entity0 ’s tirade sparked them into life and goals from @entity13 and @entity14 sealed victory at @entity16			1
the improved performance did not , however , spare the team from post-match criticism			2
laboured : @entity13 gave @entity2 the lead but the hosts made hard work of @entity8 come on lads : @entity0 cut a frustrated figure during the first half at @entity16 @entity0 , though , was not happy with the slow start			1
he said : ' i prefer to train in the morning , but this week i trained in the afternoon because this is not the best weather to play football , you get lazy			2
' this weather pushes players to be a bit lazy , to lose a bit of tension , a bit of sharpness in your body , after that you pass slow , you do not react to the second balls , the time goes on and on , then when you wake up , it is half - time			2
get in there : but he had plenty to celebrate in the second half as the @entity4 went onto win 2 - 0 @entity47 : @entity2 and @entity8 players argue after a bad challenge by @entity50 on @entity51 ' in the first half , the team was lazy , and i did not like that			1
' but they improved in the second half and they won , which is the most important thing			2
' at half - time , we had to be a bit emotional with them			2
i told them the way we were playing was not good enough to win the game and that we were at risk			0
' it is impossible to play football if you do not win one second ball , it was basic but important things			0
" @entity0 continued : ' i told them if you have the same feeling and vision i have , we are not in trouble , because we change , but if you do not agree , we are in trouble and do not win the game			1
' in the second half , it was better as we were a positive and enthusiastic , so we were too strong for them			0
' but let 's not forget that they had a one - on - one situation against @entity84			0
' @entity0 had made another big selection call in leaving striker @entity86 out of the match - day squad , which included @entity88 who received a warm welcome on his return to @entity16			1
new hero : costa wheels away to celebrate his first goal for @entity2 at @entity16 decisive : @entity2 keeper @entity84 denies @entity94 - minutes before costa strikes opportunity missed : @entity8 players @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 react to @entity94 fluffing his lines @entity86 has been linked with a move to @entity103 , but @entity0 has no intentions of off - loading the @entity105			1
' the reason is i decided to keep the same team , to have a bench with a complete balance			0
sometimes i can have two strikers on the bench , sometimes i cant , ' he said			0
' i want three strikers in the team			0
sometimes i play with two , one on the bench , sometimes someone will be injured or suspended			0
' i can not do a season without three strikers			0
' i want him ( to stay )			0
' he will play and score goals , to be very useful for us , he is a fantastic guy , a fantastic professional , so there is no problem			0
' @entity13 , signed from @entity122 , opened his account at @entity124 , and @entity0 has been impressed by the speed of the @entity128 - born forward 's transition			1
' i got the feeling in pre-season that his adaptation would not be a big deal , he is an easy guy , ' said @entity0			2
denied : @entity133 made several top saves to deny @entity2 , including this one from @entity51 love in : @entity2 fans make their feelings about boss @entity138 tactician @entity0 clear ' his style of play has adapted to our needs , so it has not been a problem			1
' @entity8 could count themselves somewhat unfortunate not to have pushed @entity2 harder given their efforts up to the hour mark			1
foxes boss @entity147 feels his side , who drew 2 - 2 against @entity150 on the opening weekend , should not be too downhearted			1
' the players are disappointed we were unable to convert an encouraging performance with the reward of points , but there are a lot of positives from today , ' he said			0
good effort : @entity147 was satisfied with @entity8 's performance despite the result ' the good thing is we created chances throughout the game and we wanted to be positive			1
' for the most part , we played very well today , but as always it is going to be about how efficient you are in both penalty areas and we did not quite find the right way today			0
' @entity147 , meanwhile , confirmed there was no further progress on a proposed transfer for @entity175 midfielder @entity174 , but wants to bring fresh faces in ahead of the september 1 deadline			2
the @entity8 manager said : ' it is not that we have not been trying			1
it is clear we do need one or two more players , and we will endeavour to add to the squad			0

@entity2 boss @entity0 was far from happy despite making it six points out of six against @entity8
goals from @entity13 and @entity14 secured the win
but @entity0 said : ' in the first half , the team was lazy , and i did not like that '
@entity2 one of only two teams to win both @entity6 games so far
@entity4 boss dismisses *speculation* about @entity86 *future* despite the striker 's *omission* from the matchday squad
@entity8 manager @entity147 *pleased* with *display* despite *defeat*
