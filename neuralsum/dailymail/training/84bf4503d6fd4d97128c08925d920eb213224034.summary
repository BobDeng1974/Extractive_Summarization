@entity0 has unveiled a new ‘ wag tax ’ on designer goods as the party opened its conference in @entity3 today			1
the party ’s economic spokesman @entity6 said it made ‘ no sense ’ to levy vat on everyday goods at the same rate as luxury items unaffordable to all but the very richest			1
he said there should be an extra 5 per cent tax on £ 200 shoes , £ 1,000 handbags and £ 50,000 cars			1
he said the party was now ‘ mainstream not extreme ’ , unveiling sweeping tax changes			1
these include raising the personal income tax allowance to the level of the full - time minimum wage			1
this would mean no - one paying income tax until they earn over £ 13,500 a year			1
the party would also cut the 40 per cent rate of income tax to 35 per cent for earnings between £ 42,000 and £ 55,000			1
inheritance tax would also be scrapped altogether			2
mr @entity52 told the conference : ' i want it to investigate the feasibility of imposing a luxury goods rate of @entity8			1
' it makes no sense to me that @entity8 is levied at the same rate on budget items purchased by the hard - pressed as it is on premium ones that are the preserve of the very well heeled			1
‘ and it seems to me that a luxury goods rate of 25 per cent could raise substantial extra funds from the wealthiest people			1
' i would suggest such a rate be built around simple thresholds such as £ 200 for a pair of shoes , £ 1,000 for a bag or £ 50,000 for a new car			1
’ @entity0 leader @entity19 visited a @entity3 cafe talking to workers before his speech at the @entity0 conference in the town today a @entity0 delegate at @entity79 ( left ) listens intently while the party 's @entity81 mep @entity80 ( right ) arrives to hear the party 's leader @entity19 speak this afternoon the @entity0 party conference at @entity79 sold a host of speciality products , including this ' @entity89 ' stick of rock he also explained the party ’s bid to scrap tax - free shopping for foreigners			2
mr @entity6 said : ' the @entity96 calls it " tax free shopping "			1
it basically means that foreign nationals can claim back the vat paid on purchases by filling out a form at the airport			2
‘ so foreign tycoons can get 20 per cent off their purchases in @entity36 , thanks to a @entity96 waiver that is in turn bankrolled by ordinary @entity110 taxpayers			2
' the @entity96 is very coy about how much revenue is lost to vat rebates to foreigners			2
but @entity114 calculates that it is at least £ 300million a year and i have seen estimates which point to it being significantly higher			2
this perk should be scrapped			0
' it comes after @entity122 revealed super rich @entity123 were spending £ 4.5million a day in @entity110 - cementing @entity36 's position as the world 's top playground for the rich			0
in total last year £ 1.25billion was spent in the @entity110 by families from the @entity130 - amounting to some £ 25,000 for every holiday			0
the party attacked the ' @entity134 clowns ' in the main political parties in @entity136 , including @entity137 ' the @entity138 , the former conservative cabinet minister @entity140 was a figure of fun for many of the @entity0 delegates in @entity3 today @entity146 visitors meanwhile lavished £ 156 a day , according to the @entity147			0
they are the biggest spenders of all foreign visitors to @entity110			0
only tourists under the title ' other middle east ' spend more - at some £ 173 a day			0
@entity153 are the third biggest spenders , handing over £ 149 a day during their stay			0
@entity157 tourists as a whole contribute more than @entity123 to @entity110 's tourist industry - spending a total of £ 1.5billion last year			0
but the number of visitors from the @entity157 far outstrips those from the @entity130 - leaving the spending per person from the @entity123 world way ahead of that from the @entity157			0
arabs now spend twice as much as @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 - and 50 per cent more than @entity157			0
spending by overseas visitors last year soared by 12.7 per cent since 2012 to £ 21billion			0
more than half of this - some 53.6 per cent - was spent in @entity36			0
the amount spent by overseas visitors in the capital itself almost doubled between 2003 and 2013 .			0

economic spokesman @entity52 calls for new luxury goods tax
it would increase the vat rate from 20 **%** to 25 **%** on *expensive* items
tax would start at £ 200 for shoes , £ 1,000 for handbags and £ 50,000 for cars
