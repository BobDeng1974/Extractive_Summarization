the late , great @entity0 was ringside for @entity3 's @entity2 against @entity4 in @entity5 in 1974			1
here is his dispatch from @entity8 the morning after the fight before			1
the sun had the audacity to rise over @entity12 yesterday while mr @entity3 was still speaking			1
his message was really quite trivial			2
he will require $ 10million , he informed the universe , to perform his next miracle in the boxing ring			0
this works out at something slightly over Â£ 4m an hour , or , alternatively , precisely twice as much as he received for exposing @entity4 as not quite the immovable object we thought			1
@entity3 stands over @entity4 after knocking him out in round eight in @entity5 @entity0 was a legendary sports writer who worked for the @entity23 for almost 50 years			1
he was named @entity24 at the @entity25 in 1972 , 74 , 81 and 89 and won the same award from the @entity27 in 86 , 87 and 95			0
@entity0 died of cancer in 2007			1
naturally , we shall pay for it			0
we shall rob banks , surrender life policies , shortchange widows and sell the new dishwasher to raise it			0
his recapture of the world heavyweight title here , on a morning the memory of which i shall take to the grave , entitles him to name his own price			0
by the eighth and providently last round he had , according to a communal roundup of statistics , hit @entity4 65 times flush on the face			1
it was then , from an entrenched and contemplative position , that he saw an opening which lasted as long as it takes to fire a hair - trigger pistol			0
@entity3 's @entity55 tactic was to soak up the blows as @entity4 tired himself out punching @entity3 was pinned to the ropes by @entity4 for lengthy spells during the @entity2 @entity4 is a man of ingenuous honesty			1
' a boxer , ' he said when his mind was functioning again , ' never sees the big one that hits him			0
' what hit him , in fact , was a bren - gun burst of quick blows , a left hook that spun him round into the real line of fire and a right that put him on the floor for the first time in his professional career			2
he sprawled there , blinking and subconsciously mouthing the count to himself			0
he had not one chance in 50 of getting up again			0
it was like watching a tank going over the edge of a bridge in slow motion			0
he became so confused by @entity3 's tactics that he finished the fourth round hurling wild swings into the air , and later missed so badly with the punch that was meant to finish it all that he almost went through the ropes			1
@entity3 talked to @entity4 throughout the fight and chatted to a reporter in between rounds @entity4 hit the ground for the first time in his career when @entity3 floored him in the eighth round @entity3 slapped him on the bottom			1
throughout the fight he talked to @entity99 in all the clinches and carried on a running conversation with a black @entity103 reporter in between rounds			2
in the fifth round he indulged in a piece of exhibitionism so dangerous that it would not be tried by the resident professional fighting farmhands in a fairground boxing booth			2
he sagged back so far on the ropes that he was almost in the laps of the tv commentators			0
and there he stayed for well over a minute , defending himself from @entity4 's frantic hitting only with his forearms and cupped gloves			1
@entity3 took the wildest liberties and still rode back to the world title he regards as personal property with a performance of total genius allied to immense physical courage			1
the fight that was reckoned to be his $ 5m retirement pay - off went precisely as he bragged it would			2
referee @entity125 sends @entity3 to the corner as @entity4 lies on the canvas @entity3 speaks to reporters after beating @entity4 in the eighth round of their epic battle in @entity5 ' i shall be the matador and @entity4 the bull , ' he told his @entity135 brothers last week			1
@entity3 went down , too			1
ten seconds after @entity4 was counted out , he was knocked down as his faithful leaped into the ring			2
from then , long into the dawn , he was besieged			0
' i 'm going to haunt boxing for the next six months , ' he shouted			0
' i 'll talk to the man who first offers me 10 million dollars			0
' you may say a man requires supernatural powers to command such a sum			0
at breakfast the sun went in and the rainy season started			0
this is an abridged version of a report taken from the book : searching for heroes : 50 years of @entity154 by @entity0			2
