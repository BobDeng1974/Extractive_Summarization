it 's certainly one way to race ahead in the festive ratings battle			2
the @entity2 has revealed that it will screen its controversial @entity3 special over @entity4 – despite receiving a fresh complaint from @entity7 ’s ambassador			1
the episode sparked fury when it was filmed in the @entity11 country earlier this year , with locals taking offence at the @entity15 number plate on a @entity16 driven by @entity17 , believing it was a reference to the 1982 @entity20 conflict			1
@entity21 , @entity17 and @entity22 will feature in this year 's @entity4 special of @entity3 to be broadcast : in a show of defiance that risks escalating the row even further , the corporation last night insisted the provocative episode of @entity3 will sit at the heart of its festive programming @entity17 , 54 , denied the plate was chosen deliberately and claimed that he and his fellow presenters were forced to hide under their beds and flee @entity7 after an angry mob searched their hotel and tried to attack them			1
but in a show of defiance that risks escalating the row even further , the corporation last night insisted the provocative episode will sit at the heart of its festive programming – alongside more traditional staples such as @entity45 , @entity44 and the last ever episodes of @entity47			2
there will also be a string of one - off dramas , including an adaptation of @entity53 ’s classic @entity52 starring @entity54 and @entity55			0

@entity7 ’s ambassador to the @entity71 , @entity70 has written to the @entity72 expressing ‘ discontent ’ with how the number plate fiasco was handled she claimed @entity17 ’s behaviour ‘ fell well below @entity2 ’s editorial values and standards ’ and called for a fresh investigation			1
and last night , @entity3 risked fresh controversy after a yellow @entity83 pick - up truck apparently driven by @entity17 was spotted in @entity84 without registration plates on the front or rear			1
but a @entity2 spokesman insisted the team had complied with local law , saying : ‘ as a brand new vehicle , the car was being driven with a temporary operating permit which was displayed in the window			2
’ the programme has been embroiled in a string of controversies over the years , including accusations of racism after @entity17 apparently mumbled the word n * * * * * during an outtake and referred to an @entity103 man as a ‘ slope ’ during a @entity105 special			1
in 2011 , @entity22 prompted a complaint by the @entity108 ambassador after he suggested a @entity108 car would be ‘ lazy , feckless , flatulent , overweight ’			0
