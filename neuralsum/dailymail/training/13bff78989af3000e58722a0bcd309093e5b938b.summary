by @entity0 unusual fossils unearthed in coal deposits of the @entity3 have been combined to create a map of the first ever reptile skull			1
the reconstruction pieced together previously unrecognised skeletons from the @entity8 to create the skull features of the @entity10			1
this was a small animal of generally lizard - like build that lived 308 million years ago			0
it is the earliest example of a reptile and could explain the origin of amniotes			1

scientists believe this is the earliest example of a reptile amniotes are a group of back - boned creatures that includes turtles , lizards , birds , dinosaurs and mammals			1
the study was undertaken by experts from @entity36 in @entity37 alongside a @entity39 team which included the @entity40 in @entity41 and the @entity42			0
their aim was to provide an analysis of early tetrapod relationships incorporating their new observations of the @entity18			0
pictured is the @entity18 reconstruction of skull			2
this was a small animal of generally lizard - like build that lived 308 million years ago @entity18 was a small animal around 8.7 inches ( 22cm ) in length			2
it had a generally lizard - like build with large eyes and a large number of small , pointed teeth , indicating it was an active hunter their analysis used skeletal traits across a sample of early tetrapod groups to identify the likely features of the @entity18			1

remains have been found in @entity74 , @entity3 , dating from around 308 million years ago , this places it in the upper @entity77 period - a time when amphibians were the dominant land vertebrates , of which one branch would eventually evolve into reptiles , the first fully terrestrial vertebrates			1
dr @entity84 , from the @entity85 , @entity42 , was one of the authors and produced a series of intricate hand - drawn recreations of the cranial structure of @entity18			2
‘ @entity18 has always been an elusive beast , ’ he said			2
‘ several researchers have long considered the possibility that the superficially reptile - like features of this animal might tell us something about amniote ancestry			0
‘ but @entity18 also shows some much generalised skeletal features that make the issue of its origin even more problematic			0
’ the new study shows that @entity18 is closely related to another group of @entity105 and @entity107 tetrapods called seymouriamorphs			0
‘ we found some interesting new cranial features in @entity18 that helped us establish this link , ’ said dr @entity109			1
‘ staring at specimens for a long time down a microscope and trying to make sense of their anatomy may be frustrating and tiring at times , but always immensely rewarding			0

pictured is a reconstruction of part of the skull structure of the @entity18 the reconstruction was created by @entity129 and @entity39 experts who based it on fossils found in the coal deposits of the @entity8 in the @entity3			1

@entity134 was created using fossils found in @entity8 in the @entity3
it reveals the skull features of the elusive @entity18
@entity18 is believed to be the earliest example of a reptile
it could reveal the *evolutionary* *history* of all back - boned ' amniotes '
