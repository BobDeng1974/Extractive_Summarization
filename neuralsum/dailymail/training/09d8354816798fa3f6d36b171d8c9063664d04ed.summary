crackdown : @entity0 has urged companies to remove @entity2 from creams beauty product companies have been told to stop using a chemical irritant in some products after an explosion in cases of allergic reactions and eczema			1
the chemical , a preservative called @entity2 ( @entity13 or @entity14 ) , is routinely added to moisturisers , sun creams , shampoos and wet wipes			1
skin experts in the @entity20 and around the world have picked up a large number of allergic reactions they believe are caused by the chemical			1
now , @entity0 , the @entity24 cosmetics trade association , has told its members to remove @entity13 from products that are left on the skin			1
in a statement , the body said : ‘ this action is recommended in the interests of consumer safety in relation to adverse skin reactions			2
‘ it is recommended that companies do not wait for regulatory intervention under the @entity38 but implement this recommendation as soon as feasible			0
’ the @entity40 has previously highlighted the concerns of @entity20 skin experts and suffering of a number of women who had severe allergic reactions			0
symptoms ranged from a rash of bright red tiny bumps to fluid filled lumps on the skin , blisters , itchy eyes and even a severely swollen face			0
a @entity40 survey in september found the chemical in @entity56 ; @entity57 ; @entity58 for @entity59 ; @entity60 ( 150ml ) ; @entity61 ; and @entity63 1 day @entity62			1
several companies have already announced that they will stop using @entity13 , including @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 ’s @entity63			1
however , products containing the suspect ingredient could still be on shelves			0
chemical : a @entity40 survey in september found @entity76 and @entity60 were among many creams to contain @entity13 , alongside @entity58 and @entity63 products @entity20 skin experts say the scale of the allergic reactions to the chemical , which has been used increasingly since 2005 , has been alarming			1
dermatologists expect an allergic reaction to a cosmetic product of no more than 1 - 2per cent , however @entity20 clinics report that the rate has been more than 10per cent for @entity13			2
it is claimed that scale of harm is more than twice the level of another ingredient called @entity93 ( methydibromo glutaronitrile ) , which was banned by the @entity94 in 2008			0
leading dermatologist dr @entity96 from @entity95 , @entity97 , said : ‘ the frequency of reactions to @entity13 is unprecedented in my experience			1
we ’ve never seen anything quite like it			0
‘ @entity103 to this permitted preservative is now of epidemic proportions			0
’ dr @entity106 , a member of the @entity107 of dermatologists and president of the @entity110 of @entity111 , welcomed the industry move but said it did not go far enough			0
reaction : one in ten sufferers of dermatitis were found to have had an allergic reaction to the chemical he said : ‘ this is a promising step forward , and i welcome this demonstration of responsibility by @entity0 to pre-empt regulation on the use of @entity13			1
i hope that this recommendation will be adhered to by the association ’s members and will go some way towards protecting @entity20 and @entity24 consumers			0
‘ nevertheless , as it currently stands , this recommendation falls short of calling for the removal or a reduction of @entity13 levels in rinse - off cosmetics , such as shower gels or shampoos			2
‘ we still have concerns that its continued use at present concentrations in such products will elicit allergic reactions in those that are already sensitised			2
this is a matter which we are hoping to reach agreement on in future planned discussions			0
