@entity0 has a new marine animal in its waters , one which scientists have been debating the existence of for years			1
the @entity0 @entity5 has been determined as its very own species , and this week was given its scientific name - @entity8 sahulensis			1
one of four humpback dolphins , the @entity0 variety can be identified by its darker skin and its unique dorsal fin , which sits lower on the body			0
the @entity0 @entity5 has been determined as its very own species , and this week was given its scientific name - @entity8 sahulensis it grows to around nine feet long , or 2.7 metres , - a similar size to the @entity19 - and is shyer than its relatives , according to @entity22			1
a study by the @entity24 last year concluded that there were four species of humpback dolphins , with one found in @entity0 waters , two more in the @entity30 - @entity29 and the fourth in the @entity33 region			1
however the @entity0 humpback dolphin was only given its name on thursday , following the release of a study from the @entity38			2
the @entity40 study states : ' a review of multiple lines of evidence from skeletal morphology , external morphology , coloration , molecular genetics , and biogeography , in combination provides strong support for the recognition of four species of @entity8			0
' finally , we describe a new species of @entity8 , the @entity0 humpback dolphin , which occurs in the waters of the @entity57 from northern @entity0 to southern @entity58			1
one of four humpback dolphins , the @entity0 variety can be identified by its darker skin and its unique dorsal fin , which sits lower on the body ' it is separated from the @entity63 by a wide distributional gap that coincides with @entity65 ( a faunal line which separates @entity0 and @entity68 organisms ) '			0
prior to this study being released , there was debate over whether there was only one , possibly two species of humpback dolphins			0
lead author of the paper dr @entity78 of @entity79 , told @entity80 any confusion over how many varieties of the species there were could now be put to bed			0
' we 've finally managed to settle many long - standing questions about humpback dolphins - particularly how many species actually exist - using a huge body of data collected over two centuries and analyzed with the latest scientific tools '			0
the splitting of the species into four varieties could see each type be classes as endangered , with the population of each humpback dolphin species likely to be low .			2

@entity0 @entity8 has been named as its own species
is one of four varieties of the humpback dolphin found *worldwide*
scientists have been debating the classification of this dolphin for years
scientific name is @entity112 and relates to the region it *resides* in
