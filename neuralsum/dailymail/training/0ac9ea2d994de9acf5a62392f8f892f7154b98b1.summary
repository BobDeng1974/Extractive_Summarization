by @entity0 published : 08:21 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 08:42 est , 9 january 2013 a retired police inspector has helped experts discover a new planet from the comfort of his armchair			1
stargazer @entity6 , 71 , began his hobby after retiring 15 years ago when he became fed up of daytime television			1
mr @entity6 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , enrolled on a computer course at @entity12 and now uses his technology skills to analyse the stars			1
@entity6 , 71 , from @entity10 , and the laptop he used to help experts discover a new planet from the comfort of his armchair - now named by astronomers as ' @entity19 ' his years of seaching the skies have paid off after he discovered the planet - now named by astronomers as ' @entity19 '			1
mr @entity6 said : ' there is nothing worth watching on the television and there 's only so much gardening you can do and you have to have other things to fill your time in			2
' i like the odd quiz show and @entity30 but the rest of the soaps are a bit beyond me - they are just miserable			0
' with astronomy you can see things you would never imagine like galaxies and star formations			0
' however , rather than park himself at the end of a telescope , mr @entity6 prefers to research in comfort and uses his computer to uncover the mysteries of space whilst reclining in his armchair			2
mr @entity6 volunteered to analyse information for astronomers as part of ' @entity50 ' project set up by @entity51 and @entity52 , which asked for citizen scientists to spot patterns in celestial data			1
' i do n't have a telescope and i do n't want one - i can do it all from the computer , ' he said			0
stargazer @entity6 , 71 , from @entity10 , said his wife is still unimpressed after he helped experts discover a new planet from the comfort of his armchair - now named by astronomers as ' @entity19 ' ' i do n't want to sit outside in the cold when i can sit in the warmth and comfort of my own front room and look at the computer			1
' i see things i could never see in the back garden with a telescope			0
' the problem is , the astronomers have collected all of this data using satellites but they do n't have the time or manpower to analyse it all , so they post their findings on a website and invite the public to highlight anything of interest			0
' the discovery of the planet is the first major find for mr @entity6 , who describes it as ' a little bit like winning the lottery			1
' mr @entity6 has been credited in a research paper which has been published online by the prestigious @entity87 , and is only one of a handful of volunteers to do so.the planet @entity19 , orbits a sun - like star in the constellation @entity94 several hundred light years away			1
however , his wife remains unimpressed			0
mr @entity6 said : ' my wife @entity95 is n't all that interested in the stars , she just lets me get on with it			2
' but she did say i need a new bigger hat for my head swelling ! ' mr @entity6 is part of a team of international armchair stargazers who assist scientists analyzing outer space in their spare time			1
after joining @entity108 as a pc , mr @entity6 worked his way up to become an inspector			2
since retiring after 30 years of service , star gazing has become the pensioners full time occupation and says it is just as thrilling as catching criminals			0
mr @entity6 admitted that he sometimes spends more time online than he should			1
he said : ' it 's a little bit addictive			0
i look at a bit of data , then i know i should stop but i think ' just one more '			0
' you never know what the next one is going to be ' the discovery led researchers to claim moons like the one depicted in the film @entity127 may be among the most common places to find alien life			0
astronomers came to the conclusion after identifying up to 15 new planets orbiting the life - friendly ' habitable zones ' of stars			1
all are giant gaseous worlds similar in size to @entity139 or @entity140			0
@entity127 was set on a moon filled with lush forests - and researchers say it could be more real than its director thought			0
while such planets would not themselves be suitable for @entity149 - like life , they could be circled by moons on which there are forests , oceans and living creatures , researchers now believe			1
@entity155 , the fictional moon in @entity127 , is just such a world			0
so far only one of the 15 newly discovered objects has been confirmed as an exoplanet with 99.9 % certainty			2
the rest still fall into the category of ' candidate ' planets while further evidence is collected			0
the confirmed planet , known as @entity19 , orbits a sun - like star in the constellation @entity94 several hundred light years away			1
astronomer dr @entity170 , from @entity51 , a member of the international team behind the discovery , said : ' there 's an obsession with finding @entity149 - like planets but what we are discovering with planets such as @entity19 b is far stranger			1
' @entity139 has several large water - rich moons			2
imaging dragging that system into the comfortably warm region where the @entity149 is			0
' if such a planet had @entity149 - size moons , we 'd see not @entity186 and @entity187 but worlds with rivers , lakes and all sorts of habitats : a surprising scenario that might just be common			1
an artist 's impression of of the view from a moon orbiting the planet @entity19			1
scientists says moons like the one depicted in the film @entity127 may be among the most common places to find alien life , ' it may be that the most common habitable worlds are moons around @entity139 and @entity140 - size planets rather than rocky planets as in our own solar system			1
' members of the public helped astronomers identify the candidate exoplanets by logging onto the planethunters.org website on their home computers			0
the @entity218 project invites ' citizen scientists ' to spot graph patterns signifying the tell - tale dip in brightness as planets pass in front of their parent stars			2
follow - up work with the @entity227 in @entity228 provided the proof that @entity19 b is almost certainly a genuine planet			1
planet hunters lead scientist professor @entity233 , from @entity234 in the @entity235 , said : ' we are seeing the emergence of a new era in the @entity218 project where our volunteers seem to be at least as efficient as the computer algorithms at finding planets orbiting at habitable zone distances from the host stars			1
' now , the hunt is not just targeting any old exoplanet ; volunteers are homing in on habitable worlds			0
' @entity127 featured a world with an entirely alien ecosystem - and experts now say that moon like @entity155 could be the best place to look for alien life before the latest finds , 19 other exoplanets had already been located in habitable zones			2
also known as the ' @entity258 ' , this is the orbital path where temperatures are not too hot or cold but " just right " to permit liquid surface water			0
dr @entity261 , another @entity218 scientist from @entity234 , said : ' we can speculate that @entity19 might have a rocky moon that would be suitable for life			2
' i ca n't wait for the day when astronomers report detecting signs of life on other worlds instead of just locating potentially habitable environments			0
' that could happen any day now			0

@entity6 , 71 , was part of an online team analysing data - and helped discover new planet @entity19
claims terrible daytime tv shows drove him to take up astronomy as a hobby
the amateur planethunters have already discovered 15 new planets that could have habitable moons
