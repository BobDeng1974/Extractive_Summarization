@entity1 , 23 , lied that he had gashed his head after slipping on a wet floor outside his cell in an attempt to deceive a prison into paying him £ 6,000			1
in reality he had sustained the injury play - fighting with another inmate and his lie was exposed when he was recorded bragging about the plan to his girlfriend in a telephone call from prison			2
jailing the serial criminal for two years for perverting the course of justice , judge @entity25 attacked the solicitors that backed his case			0
he added that ‘ the prison governor would be fully justified in banning ’ @entity33 from representing inmates at the jail for ‘ taking no steps to find out this was a deceitful claim ’			1
prison officials are understood to have reported the firm to the @entity40			0
judge @entity41 told @entity1 : ‘ prisoners making false claims for damages through solicitors or otherwise will be heavily penalised			2
’ @entity47 @entity46 heard that @entity1 , who has 20 previous convictions , was serving time for burglary at @entity50 in @entity47 when he suffered the 2 inch gash in a fight			1
the injury was caused when he attempted to butt a fellow inmate but instead cut his head on the door of his cell			1
@entity58 , prosecuting , said @entity1 ’s cell was next to the showers , so he ‘ hatched a plan ’ to try to con money from the jail by blaming it on a slippery floor			1
but five days after the incident last december , during routine monitoring of prisoners ’ phone calls , @entity1 was overheard telling his girlfriend how he planned to make thousands from the scam			2
despite this , the prison continued to investigate the complaint , and so @entity1 repeated the lie to a health and safety officer and instructed @entity33 to pursue his claim for £ 6,000 damages			1
in february the firm wrote to prison bosses alleging negligence			2
@entity1 was arrested after being confronted with the incriminating phone call			0
the 23 - year - old , who has 20 previous convictions , was serving time for burglary when he hatched the plan in @entity50 to scam cash from @entity47 last december in a police interview he admitted : ‘ i thought because the showers were leaking i could make some money out of it because there was nothing there to say that the floor was wet			0
’ prison staff said that at worst the floor might have been ‘ slightly dampened ’ from inmates walking from the showers back to their cells			1
@entity100 , defending , described @entity1 ’s claim as ‘ an act of stupidity ’ , adding : ‘ whether the claim would have got anywhere in the long run remains to be seen			1
’ @entity1 , of @entity107 , @entity47 , also admitted robbery			0
@entity33 ’s director , @entity109 , said : ‘ we are carrying out an internal inquiry and will co-operate fully with any investigation by the @entity40			0
’ according to its website , the firm is a small practice specialising in personal injury and mis - selling claims			0
it is understood not to carry out regular work with prisoners and is likely to tell any inquiry it had no reason not to take @entity1 ’s account in good faith			0
