the @entity1 military has decided against rebuilding the entire @entity3 army and will instead focus on training a handful of brigades to take on @entity7 radicals , initiating a shift in the @entity10 's decade - long approach to the handling the country			1
' the idea is , at least in the first instance , to try and build a kind of leaner , meaner @entity3 army , ' a senior @entity1 official told the @entity18			1
officials who spoke to the @entity18 on the condition of anonymity said the military plans to create nine new @entity3 army brigades of up to 45,000 light - infantry soldiers over the course of the next two months and team them with other @entity27 and @entity28 fighters			1
the @entity1 military has altered its plans to train and equip all @entity3 forces to fight @entity36 and will instead focus on readying nine select brigades to take on the terrorist group at the height of the @entity1 occupation of the country , @entity3 boasted 400,000 combat forces			1
but the number of able troops had dwindled down to roughly half that by last summer , the @entity18 said			0
in september gen. @entity46 , chairman of the @entity47 , told reporters that @entity1 military assessors had discovered that 24 of the @entity3 army 's existing 50 brigades were not fit to fight because of their sectarian differences			1
the remaining 26 brigades did n't have the right training and equipment , @entity46 admitted , making it impossible for the nation to properly defend itself against @entity36			2
the @entity18 said thursday that an updated count conducted by @entity59 , a fellow with the @entity60 , now puts the number of active brigades at just 36			2
in any case , the country is n't currently equipped to launch an offensive against @entity36 that would allow it to retake its largest city , @entity67			2
that sort of a mission would require roughly 80,000 soldiers , @entity46 has said			0
in september he suggested that a time may come when @entity1 ground forces would be needed to supplement @entity3 forces if they underwent a major incursion to retake @entity67 but has made it clear he 's made no such recommendation to the president			1
as of the beginning of november the @entity1 had 1,400 non-combat troops in @entity3 serving as advisers with the option to send in up to 1,700 more under the direction of president @entity84			2
@entity84 has ruled out putting @entity1 combat boots on the ground to the irritation of lawmakers who would like to see the @entity1 take a more aggressive role in the @entity91 conflict			0
instead , he has asked for $ 5.6 billion from @entity92 to fund his current military campaign against @entity36 , including $ 1.6 billion to train and equip @entity3 and @entity27 forces			1
the @entity10 said at the time of the request that additional troops and money sent in to @entity3 would aid in the creation of ' two expeditionary advise - and - assist operations centers , in locations outside of @entity33 and @entity101 , to provide support for the @entity3 at the brigade headquarters level and above			2
' these centers will be supported by an appropriate array of force protection , ' @entity10 spokesman rear adm. @entity104 said in a statement			0
@entity104 also also claimed that @entity109 would ' establish several sites across @entity3 that will accommodate the training of 12 @entity3 brigades , specifically nine @entity3 army and three [ @entity27 ] @entity115 brigades			1
' the @entity18 reported thursday that the @entity1 also has high hopes for the creation of a ' national guard ' of @entity3 , @entity28 and @entity27 peshmerga forces similar to a 2006 - 2007 program initiative by the @entity1 that would be managed by the @entity3 government			1
the formation of a national guard would have to be approved by the @entity3 legislature , though , and it 's no where close to taking that step			0
@entity1 chairman of the @entity47 , @entity127 gen. @entity46 addresses questions from @entity1 military members during a town hall meeting in @entity33 , @entity3 last week			1
@entity46 has indicated in the past that @entity1 troops may be put into combat situations in @entity3 in the future , even though president @entity84 says they wo n't a fighter for @entity36 holds holds the group 's flag and a weapon on a street in the city of @entity67 in june			1
@entity3 security forces have made substantial progress in taking their country back from the @entity7 extremist group , but it will be a long time before it will have the resources to retake @entity67 , the nation 's largest city a dozen of the @entity1 ' top attack aircraft are being rerouted from @entity150 to @entity151 to aid in the fight against @entity36			1
the a- 10 @entity154 will also joined within six weeks by @entity156 drones as well , the @entity153 reports			0
@entity157 10s come with a 30mm cannon and can carry missiles as well as 500lb bombs			0
flying as low as 50ft , the planes are better able to access to targets on the ground than the warplanes currently carrying out airstrikes in @entity3 and @entity166			0
they also feature heavy armor , which protects them against small - arms fire and rocket - propelled grenades			0
in @entity150 they have proved successful and targeting @entity173 near @entity1 patrols and keeping the terrorist group at bay			0
even legislators who normally take a dovish stance on military intervention , including @entity181 sen. @entity180 , have acknowledged that some @entity1 ground forces may be necessary to destroy @entity36 , though			1
@entity180 plans to introduce legislation after the @entity185 holiday that declares war on @entity36 in @entity3 and @entity166 and authorizes the president to continue bombing the countries and to deploy @entity1 soldiers into combat situations there in certain circumstances , including ' for limited operations against high value targets			1
' the @entity194 has pointed to old authorization of @entity197 agreements passed by @entity92 giving @entity198 permission to invade @entity3 and engage terrorists militarily as its legal authority to carry out air strikes in @entity36 in the two countries			2
according to @entity180 and other @entity208 lawmakers , however , the current commander in chief 's authority to attack the group expired 60 days after the first bomb was dropped , per the @entity210 , and he must seek new authorization from @entity92 - which he 'll most likely get if it comes up for a vote - to continue the strikes			0
according to @entity215 , the cost of air strikes averaged $ 8.3 million a day in mid-october and had already cost more than $ 580 million since they began aug. 8 , data from @entity109 showed			0
on thursday @entity3 's finance minister @entity217 said his country had made headway in the battle against @entity36 in no small part because of the @entity1 - led airstrikes			1
@entity217 told @entity36 soldiers are no longer able to engage in direct combat with @entity3 forces because the fighting exposes them to air raids			1
' after all these years nobody wants to see a caliphate of hatred			0
they are no longer an existential threat to our existence , ' he said			0
@entity3 army forces and @entity115 forces are seen here launching a @entity1 - led operation in @entity238 in @entity3 last weekend			1
they later regained control of the town in the @entity243 region @entity245 and @entity115 forces celebrate their victories over @entity36 in @entity238 and neighboring town @entity247 ' they are still a very very serious threat , ' though , he cautioned , noting that @entity36 has continued to use an array of other guerrilla tactics , including roadside bombs and suicide bombers , to conduct warfare			0
@entity217 said he did n't know how much longer it would take to eliminate @entity36 entirely , telling @entity36 , ' i do n’t have the crystal ball to tell you			2
it will take some time			0
' i think we are winning , they are losing , ' he added			0
just this week @entity3 soldiers and police working with an @entity265 - backed @entity28 group and @entity27 peshmerga fighters were able to retake the towns of @entity238 and @entity268 in the @entity243			1
some of the greatest hindrances to additional progress come from within the @entity3 military , not from outside forces , however			2
' definitely we will recommend strongly that there should be some serious deep - rooted reforms in the military security establishment to fight corruption , mismanagement , ' @entity217 told @entity36 while previewing a request to spend close a quarter of the country 's 2015 budget on defense spending			1
of the most common forms of corruption within the battalions is the enlistment of ' ghost soldiers ' - @entity3 who sign up but never show up for service allowing commanders to pocket their pay			2
' all the formations have to be reviewed in terms of the numbers			0
there should be no ghost members of the military , ' @entity217 said			2
' people should be accountable			0
your battalion , the number of your members should be accounted for , for weapons or salaries , for munitions for food			0
these are basic things it does n’t need a genius ( to understand )			0
' since taking over in august @entity3 's new prime minister @entity309 , who replaced previous @entity310 @entity311 , has already replaced more than 20 senior military commanders , the @entity18 says .			1
