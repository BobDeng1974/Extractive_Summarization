around 2.6 million years ago , the first stone tools began appearing in the archaeological record			1
but now researchers have found that our early ancestors may have had the ability to use stone tools around half a million years earlier			1
far from being the fumbling creatures we believed , a look at fossils of @entity11 reveals the species had human - like hands capable of ' squeeze ' gripping			1
top row from left to right is the thumb of a chimpanzee , a thumb fossil hominins @entity11 and two speices of early humans			1
the bottom row shows 3d renderings from the scans of the same specimens , showing a cross-section of thetrabecular structure inside dr @entity27 and dr @entity28 from @entity29 analysed on the internal spongy structure of bone called trabeculae			2
this remodels quickly during a lifetime and can reflect the behaviour of individuals , as well as how they use their hands			0
the researchers compared scans of @entity11 and modern ape hand bones with scans of hand bones from modern species			1
this included a 90,000 - year - old @entity45 , two roughly 60,000 - year - old @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity49 nubians who lived between about 1,500 and 2,000 years ago			1
researchers have found that our early ancestors may have had the ability to use stone tools more than half a million years earlier			1
pictured is an example of a human precision grip , grasping an australopithecus africanus thumb fossil which is thought to be two to three million - years - old far from being the fumbling creatures , a look at fossils of @entity11 reveals the species had human - like hands capable of ' squeeze ' gripping			1
pictured is a pattern of trabecular bone distribution - the spongy part of the hand - in @entity11 ( left ) , @entity46 ( centre ) and @entity45 ( right ) @entity11 was one of the longest - lived early human species			1
so far , paleoanthropologists have uncovered remains from more than 300 individuals in @entity74			0
pictured is an artist 's impression they found humans and @entity46 had hands capable of holding items between the thumb and fingertips			2
the researchers found that @entity11 had human - like hands that were capable of precision grips			2
this would have helped them squeeze small objects , such a stone tools			1
these early members of the human family tree also had an opposable thumb			0
these hand features may have evolved from earlier human ancestors that hadlong fingers and short thumbs , which climbing trees			0
the researchers said it is possible the patterns in the bone were created by handling stone flakes and cutting meat			2
it is equally plausible that they could be using it to access various vegetable materials like potatoes , yams , they said			0
the australopithecus africanus fossils , excavated at @entity112 ’s @entity111 , had concentrations of spongy bone at the base of the thumb and in the knuckles of the third and fifth fingers - similar to homo sapiens			1
meanwhile , chimpanzees , gorillas , orangutans and gibbons show a different pattern of spongy bone distribution in their hands , caused by tree climbing			2
this means that even if @entity11 had not been considered as toolmakers before , they were at least prepared to handle stone tools with a precision grip			1
the researchers said it is possible the patterns in the bone were created by handling stone flakes and cutting meat			2
it is equally plausible that they could be using it to access various vegetable materials like potatoes , yams , they said			0
their findings cast doubt on the long - standing assumption that homo habilis was the first hominin toolmaker			0
it follows research that emerged last week he first conversation between our ancestors was about @entity155 and likely took place between 2.5 to 1.8 million years ago			1
this study found stone tool - making drove the evolution of language among our human ancestors in the @entity164 savannah			2
researchers found clear differences between humans , who have the ability for precision gripping between thumb and fingers , and chimpanzees , who are unable to do this			0
fossils analysis revealed @entity11 ( second left ) , also had a human - like trabecular bone pattern @entity11 had ape - like face proportions , including a flat nose , a strongly projecting lower jaw fossil bones of @entity11 were previously excavated at @entity112 ’s @entity182 it suggests communication among our earliest ancestors may have been more complex than previously thought , and that tool - making helped drive evolution			1
@entity11 was one of the longest - lived early human species			2
so far , paleoanthropologists have uncovered remains from more than 300 individuals in @entity74			0
the species survived for more than 900,000 years , which is over four times as humans			2
previous studies into @entity11 has found that they had a mixture of primitive features and of more advanced features typical of later human species			1
their children grew rapidly after birth and reached adulthood earlier than modern humans			0
they had ape - like face proportions , including a flat nose , a strongly projecting lower jaw			0
they are believed to have had small brains , which were a third of the size of a human brain			0
@entity213 ( shown in the green boxes ) suggest the use of the bone fragment for carved sharpening the cutting edges of stone tools neanderthals have a reputation for being lumbering , cavemen with low @entity223 , but a new discovery suggests they may have been more intelligent than we think			1
a 60,000 - year - old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in @entity227 suggests @entity46 understood how to use bones to make useful devices			0
this skill was previously attributed to our species , @entity45 , and casts a new light on evolution 250,000 to 28,000 years ago			1
' this is the first time a multi-purpose bone tool from this period has been discovered , ' said @entity237 from the @entity238			0
' it was long thought that before @entity45 , other species did not have the cognitive ability to produce this type of artefact			0
' this discovery reduces the presumed gap between the two species and prevents us from saying that one was technically superior to the other			0
' the tool was uncovered during annual digs at the @entity252 at @entity253 in @entity254 , @entity227			0
extremely well preserved , the tool comes from the left femur of an adult reindeer and its age is estimated between 55,000 and 60,000 years old .			0

discovery was made by analysing @entity11 fossils
*scientists* compared their spongy trabecular bone to that of humans
they found similar patterns suggesting the species could grip tools
it was previously believed stone tools were used 2.6 million years ago
