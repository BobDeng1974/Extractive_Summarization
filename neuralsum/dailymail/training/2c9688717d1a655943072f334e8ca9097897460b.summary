by @entity1 reporter published : 14:08 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 14:10 est , 27 august 2013 a mother - of - four is serving a lengthy prison sentence after tricking her family and friends into believing she was pregnant with twins - before falsely claiming they had died in childbirth			1
@entity9 , 37 , also convinced doctors and friends in @entity11 , @entity12 that her four other young children suffered from serious illnesses , leading one to undergo invasive surgeries			1
she was eventually diagnosed with @entity17 syndrome and @entity17 - by - proxy , in which sufferers make up illnesses for themselves and their children and often induce the symptoms			2
two years after she was sentenced to eight years in prison , the lead investigator in the case has spoken to @entity26 about her string of lies and how they were discovered			1
plot : mother - of - four @entity9 , pictured with her husband @entity31 , pretended her children were ill and that she had given birth to stillborn babies - when she had never even been pregnant ' i 've been in law enforcement for 30 years and have been an investigator for 25 of those years			1
i 've investigated everything from homicides to armed thefts , ' officer @entity38 said			0
' i had never encountered anything like this before			0
' he revealed how police learned of the scheme when @entity47 were interviewing her about her unruly stepson , and noticed she was talking about his attitude harming the unborn babies			1
after claiming the babies had indeed died , @entity47 decided to investigate further and discovered the litany of lies , extending to all of her children			1
@entity57 had four children when she married @entity31 - who also had a son of his own from a previous relationship - on june 23 , 2007			1
@entity57 claimed her then 13 - year - old son had needed his gallbladder removed as a child after she took him to the doctor with frequent vomiting			1
she also claimed he needed a liver transplant			1
she also had a daughter , 9 , who suffered from leukemia , she said			1
the girl supposedly underwent chemotherapy and collection pots were placed around town to raise money for her medical bills			0
guilty : @entity9 , left , was convicted of several counts of cruelty to children after pretending her kids were ill when they were not			1
her husband , right , was convicted on one count for locking up his son doctors found that @entity9 had @entity17 and @entity17 by proxy			1
in both conditions , the person purposefully fabricates medical conditions so that they can get attention or sympathy			0
munchausen syndrome patients tell falsehoods about themselves , while in @entity17 by proxy , an adult will invent medical conditions for his or her child			0
a dangerous facet of this is how they will often induce symptoms in the child to better illustrate the lie			0
@entity17 by proxy is typically considered a severe form of child abuse			0
they belong to a group of conditions called factitious disorders , which are either made up or self - inflicted			2
if it is not discovered , it can lead to death from self - inflicting the harm or because of harming the child			1
dr. @entity114 , an international expert in the disorder , told @entity116 : ' it is a diagnosis of people who evolve lifestyles in which they travel from hospital to hospital , getting themselves admitted and subjecting themselves to surgery they do n't need			0
' what they have in common is this quest for sympathy â€“ a desperate search and yearning for some kind of identity as a patient or the vicarious identity of a patient			0
' due to the dishonest nature of the condition , it is hard to say how many people in the @entity139 suffer from @entity17 syndrome , but it is considered to be rare			0
it generally more typically occurs in men than in woman and most often affects young adults			0
@entity57 claimed that her other children also suffered from medical conditions and that one child , who was then 11 , was the result of her being raped by her co-worker			2
this was never reported to police			0
around this time , @entity57 also claimed she had fallen pregnant with the couple 's twins			1
she took pictures of her rounded belly - but did not reveal to friends or family that she had actually had her tubes tied ahead of the marriage , making a pregnancy impossible			2
in 2008 , the couple called the police about @entity31 ' son , claiming he had threatened the family with a knife			2
they complained he was unruly and neighbors rarely saw him leave the home			0
after the knife incident , @entity47 launched an investigation and @entity57 regularly met with a caseworker - who noticed some bizarre behavior			1
' during this whole period of time when the mother would be talking to his attorney , she made several references about his behavior being responsible for the safety and wellbeing of her unborn twins , ' @entity38 told @entity116			0
it was almost as if she was predicting the future			0
on november 10 , 2008 , @entity57 called her husband and family from hospital to say the twins , who she had been carrying for five months , were stillborn and had been cremated			1
three days later , the family gathered to mourn the babies at the family 's local church , where their ashes were placed in teddy - bear shaped urns and ultrasounds were put on display			1
little did the family know that the urns had been ordered five days ahead of the ' birth ' and that the ultrasounds belonged to a stranger - and had been downloaded from the internet			1
when @entity47 learned about the stillbirths , they contacted @entity38 , who in turn contacted the hospital - and found they did not have records of her check ups or birth			1
as the investigation continued , officers learned that the eldest son did not need a liver transplant and they questioned whether his gallbladder had been removed unnecessarily			1
mistreatment : she claimed one of her daughters , pictured , had leukemia and one of her sons needed a liver transplant			1
investigators said they are glad they learned of the case before they were seriously hurt they also learned that the daughter had not suffered from leukemia and @entity57 had instead lied about going for chemotherapy treatments			2
in yet another startling twist , officers then searched the couple 's home and found that @entity31 ' son had been tied in a small wooden box inside a linen closet every night as the family slept			2
the couple said that the boy was violent and needed to be constrained - but analysis of him showed he only suffered from @entity243 as a result of being locked in the box			2
@entity57 herself underwent evaluations and found that she had @entity17 syndrome - but no other major mental health issues			2
' she is not psychiatrically ill in the sense of a major diagnosis like schizophrenia , ' dr @entity114 said			0
' there are no psychiatric excuses for what she did			0
she has a personality disorder which means she has long - term , self - defeating ways to deal with stress			0
' cruelty : after authorities learned of her lies , they searched the home and found @entity57 's stepson was locked in a box in the closet each night in their home , pictured			1
the couple claimed the boy was unruly @entity114 , an expert in @entity17 , added that people with the condition often have passive partners ; @entity31 claimed he had no idea that his wife had been lying			2
@entity57 eventually pleaded guilty to several counts of cruelty to children and theft by deception for the donation buckets , and she is currently serving an eight - year sentence			0
@entity31 was convicted of one count of cruelty to children , and both parents have been ordered not to contact their children without permission from the court			0
the children have not suffered any permanent physical damage and are living in foster care			0
but @entity38 said he believes the children could have suffered much worse harm - or death - if the case had not been discovered			2
' she was pretty much in denial about doing anything significantly wrong , ' @entity38 said of @entity57			0
' she did n't think she had done anything to harm her children			0

@entity9 , 37 , pretended she had given birth to the twins at five months and a *memorial* service was held for their ' ashes '
she also falsely claimed her daughter , 9 , had leukemia and needed chemo
and she claimed her son , 13 , needed a liver transplant - and he had already had his gallbladder removed
lies were discovered when @entity47 interviewed her about her unruly stepson and found *inconsistencies* in her stories
