the soldiers often call dr. @entity1 , a plastic surgeon , in a panic			2
they need liposuction , and fast			2
a number of military personnel are turning to the surgical procedure to remove excess fat from around the waist so they can pass the @entity12 's body fat test , which can determine their future prospects in the military			1
powering on : this overweight service member who failed the fitness test struggles to complete sit ups tough : a group of sailors and @entity20 who failed the so - called ' tape test ' are led by an instructor on a three mile run as they work to improve their fitness and remain in the military at the @entity27 in @entity28 ' they come in panicked about being kicked out or getting a demerit that will hurt their chances at a promotion , ' said the @entity35 , @entity36 , surgeon			1
some service members say they have no other choice because the @entity40 's method of estimating body fat is weeding out not just flabby physiques but bulkier , muscular builds			1
fitness experts and doctors agree , and are calling for the military 's fitness standards to be revamped , including the weight tables the @entity12 uses			1
they say the tables are outdated and do not reflect that @entity49 are bigger , though not necessarily less healthy			1
work it : a @entity20 who failed the so - called ' tape test ' works up a sweat lifting a 30 - pound ammunition case during a workout to improve his conditioning defense officials say only a small fraction of those who exceed body fat limits perform well on physical fitness tests			1
' those incidences are far and few between , ' said @entity64 , director of the @entity66 's @entity65			2
' we want everybody to succeed			0
this is n't an organization that trains them and says , ' hey , get the heck out '			2
' the checks are designed to ensure troops are ready for the rigors of combat			0
@entity12 officials say the military does not condone surgically altering one 's body to pass the test , though liposuction is not banned			1
the @entity40 uses what is called a ' tape test ' to make a body fat estimate by taking measurements of the waist and neck			1
those who fail are ordered to spend months in a vigorous exercise and nutrition program , which @entity20 call the ' pork chop platoon ' or ' doughnut brigade '			0
even if they later pass , failing the test once can halt promotions for years , service members say			1
work for it : service members are put through their paces at the @entity27 in @entity28 so they 're not kicked out of the military failing three times can be grounds for getting kicked out , military officials say			1
the number of @entity106 soldiers booted for being overweight has jumped tenfold in the past five years from 168 in 2008 to 1,815			1
in the @entity20 , the figure nearly doubled from 102 in 2010 to 186 in 2011 but dropped to 132 last year			0
the @entity108 and the @entity66 said they do not track discharges tied to the tape test			2
still , service members say they are under intense scrutiny as the military trims its ranks amid budget cuts and as the @entity117 war winds down			2
dr. @entity118 of @entity119 in @entity120 said his military clientele has jumped by more than 30 percent since 2011 , with about a half - dozen service members coming in every month			1
' some see this as unethical but i say , ' what ? it 's liposuction , for @entity130 's sake ' , ' the former soldier said			1
' they have to worry about their careers			0
with the military downsizing , it 's putting more pressure on these guys			1
' staying fit : @entity20 cpl. @entity138 talks about his training program where he helps overweight service members who have failed the ' tape test ' improve their conditioning some go on crash diets or use weights to beef up their necks so they 're in proportion with a larger waist			1
@entity118 said liposuction works for those with the wrong genetics			2
' i 've actually had commanders recommend it to their troops , ' @entity118 said			0
' they 'll deny that if you ask them			0
but they know some people are in really good shape and unfortunately are just built wrong			0
' fitness expert @entity163 said there is no reliable , economical way to measure body fat , and troops should be judged more by physical performance so they 're not feeling forced to go to such lengths to save their careers			1
' we 're sending people away who could be amazing soldiers just because of two pieces of tape , ' said @entity163 , who has a doctorate in exercise physiology and has studied the accuracy of body fat measurements			1
' ninety percent of athletes who play in the @entity181 are going to fail the tape test because it 's made for a normal population , not big guys , ' he added			2
@entity20 staff sgt. @entity185 , 47 , said he can only blame himself for weighing four pounds over his maximum weight of 174 pounds for his 5 - foot - 7 frame			0
' i think we 've gotten away with keeping ourselves accountable			0
especially the older @entity20 have let things go , ' he said after sweating through 75 crunches with others ordered to the exercise program			0
' and unfortunately , i 'm an example of that			0
' big guns : desperate not to get kicked out of the military , this @entity20 works up a sweat lifting a 30 pound ammunition case studies have shown a correlation between waist size , body fat and physical endurance , military officials say , and the tape test is the best , most cost - effective tool available , with a margin of error of less than 1 percent			1
air force gen. @entity208 noted only about 348 of 1.3 million airmen have failed the tape test but excelled otherwise			2
even so , his branch heeded the complaints and modified its fitness program in october			0
the @entity108 obtained a waiver from the @entity12 so airmen who fail the tape test but pass physical fitness exams can be measured using the @entity216 , which is a chart based on an individual 's weight and height			1
@entity20 staff sgt. @entity221 applauded the move			0
@entity221 said he has won five @entity66 achievement medals but has not been promoted since failing the tape test once in 2009			0
' they call you names like ' fat bodies ' , ' @entity221 said			0
' they talk a lot of trash to you and put you down quite often			0
' he launched an online @entity233 petition this summer to talk to leaders about the tape test			0
the 1,700 signatures fell short of the 100,000 needed to get a response , but @entity221 said the @entity108 gives him hope other branches might also heed the complaints			0
' there 's got to be something better for @entity20 who are working hard but just born like a tree stump , ' @entity221 said .			0
