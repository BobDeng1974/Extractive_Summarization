by @entity0 published : 09:23 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 10:44 est , 7 november 2013 while style chameleons such as @entity3 and @entity4 constantly change their look , it seems that for the rest of us , staying true to old favourites trumps freshening up our appearance			0
according to a new survey , just like the @entity12 , more than two thirds of us admit to eschewing trends in favour of sticking to a style that suits			0
and it is n't just fashion trends that we 're avoiding			0
more than 56 per cent of women admit to leaving their make - up unchanged over the last five years while 65 per cent say they have n’t changed their hairstyle either			1
spot the difference : @entity24 of @entity25 has stayed true to her style and rarely rings the changes younger women are more likely to adopt radical changes to their look , with the survey pointing out that most of us do n't feel comfortable with our signature style until the age of 42			1
nevertheless , more than a third of women admitted to having had the same dress sense , colour and make - up as they did a decade ago			1
there are also regional differences , with @entity42 ladies proving to be the most daring about changing their hairstyle , with 57 per cent following @entity44 and @entity46 's lead and rocking a short crop , while those who live in the @entity48 are fans of a perm			1
@entity50 like to keep it simple with 73 per cent opting for a long and straight hairstyle , championed by @entity53 among others			2
chameleon : @entity4 has transformed from good girl to twerking rock n ' roller in just five years @entity50 are also the most confident about their personal style and do n’t follow celebrity trends - unlike those from the north			1
and if you 're thinking of going for the chop , you might want to reconsider after the survey revealed that 60 per cent of women regret cutting off their long hair , with another 40 per cent regretting a drastic change of colour			2
@entity70 topped the ' hair - o - meter ' as the favourite hue for hair with over 40 per cent preferring a darker shade , perhaps as a result of the @entity12 effect			2
@entity77 , a spokesman for @entity78 , which carried out the survey , said : ' it ’s no surprise that women prefer to stick to a style that suits them but it ’s extremely interesting to see how often they change their look or style			0
' every woman , whether 20 years old or 60 years old will have their own unique style and individuality			0
' the chop : @entity44 says she loves her new bob , but 60 per cent of women regret cutting their hair same look : @entity53 champions the poker straight locks beloved of ladies living in @entity95			0

more than 56 per cent have n’t changed their make - up for five years
*astonishingly* , 65 per cent have n’t changed their hairstyle either
