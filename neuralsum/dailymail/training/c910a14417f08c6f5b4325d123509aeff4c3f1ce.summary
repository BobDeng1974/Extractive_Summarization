by @entity0 , @entity1 controversial ‘ green ’ plans to lower motorway speed limits to 60mph in a bid to cut pollution levels from cars are to be scrapped by ministers			1
the reversal comes after the government ’s @entity9 announced in january that the existing national speed limit of 70mph would be curtailed on certain sections of motorways policed with a new generation of speed camera			1
transport secretary @entity16 will today announce he is ‘ rejecting ’ this approach stating : ‘ i want all motorways to run at 70mph			2
’ plans announced in january to reduce speed limits to 60mph have been abandoned a lower variable speed limit ‘ must only apply when absolutely necessary ’ , he says adding : ‘ blanket reductions are not acceptable			1
’ motorways must instead maintain the 70mph limit wherever possible ‘ particularly when traffic tends to be lighter , such as at weekends and outside of peak commuting hours , ’ he said			2
motoring groups hailed the decision as ‘ a victory for common sense			1
’ the controversial go - slow 60mph limits announced in january by the @entity9 would have meant speed limit slashed from 70mph on a three - mile section of the @entity34 between junction 3 at @entity36 in @entity37 and junction 4 near @entity39 in @entity40			1
the lower 60mph were supposed to operate between 7am and 7pm daily to meet air quality levels imposed by @entity44			1
controversial 60mph speed limits were also planned for a 32 - mile stretch of the @entity47 from junction 28 , near @entity49 in @entity50 , to junction 35a , north of @entity52 in @entity53 – again on air quality grounds			1
it too was supposed to apply for 12 hours a day - from 7am to 7pm - seven days a week and be enforced by speed - cameras and police patrols			2
that stretch of motorway goes past @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 – and also through nine so - called @entity63 ( @entity63 ) described as ‘ pockets of poor air			0
’ but today ministers will announce that 70mph must remain the norm except in exceptional circumstances			0
a @entity70 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity9 previously consulted on proposals to limit speeds to 60mph between 7am and 7pm seven days a week because of the potential effect of the new schemes on local air quality			2
‘ however , the @entity16 has rejected this approach as the government ’ s preferred option for managing the problem			2
‘ he has instead asked the @entity9 to rigorously investigate alternatives as work progresses on the schemes in the next 12 to 18 months			0
‘ if any proposals continue to include varying speed limits , they must only apply when absolutely necessary			1
in particular , the @entity9 must look for alternatives that maintain the 70mph limit wherever possible , particularly when traffic tends to be lighter , such as at weekends and outside of peak commuting hours			0
’ @entity89 @entity16 , the secretary of state for transport , has rejected calls to lower motorway speed limits to 60mph mr @entity16 said : ‘ let me be absolutely clear , i want all motorways to run at 70mph			1
while it sometimes makes sense to use variable limits to keep people moving , blanket reductions are not acceptable			0
’ this way the three new ‘ smart ’ motorway schemes on the @entity47 and @entity34 will ‘ cut congestion and give @entity105 ’s drivers smoother , quicker journeys ’ , he said giving the green light for construction will now start on the @entity101 28 - 31 in @entity50 , @entity101 32 - 35a in @entity53 and on the @entity34 at junction 2 - 4a in @entity37			0
he said the new schemes are part of £ 24billion of investment in the road network by 2021 which will see spending tripled to £ 3billion each year on @entity115 ’s key highways and motorways			0
@entity118 president @entity117 said ; ‘ this is a victory for common sense			1
we campaigned vigorously against the 60mph limit on motorways			0
why go to all the trouble of widening the motorway and adding extra lanes if you are going to cut the speed limit and slow the traffic			2
’ a @entity131 spokesman said : ‘ @entity133 motorways convert the hard shoulder to a running lane to boost capacity and smooth traffic , operating either permanently or during busy periods			0
‘ overhead variable message signs inform motorists of changes in speed limits , queuing and lane closures , while staff in regional control centres use cctv to monitor incidents and keep motorists safe			1
’ the schemes will boost capacity by a third and improve journey times by up to 10 per cent on the key stretches of the @entity47 and 15 per cent on the @entity34 , where average speeds are currently 45mph during rush - hour			0
the @entity131 spokesman stressed : ‘ the national speed limit on these sections will remain at 70 mph			1
‘ he added : ‘ drivers should see an improvement in their journeys when the @entity47 schemes commence operation from autumn 2015 , and when the @entity34 scheme opens to traffic in 2016			0
’ mr @entity165 said : ‘ @entity133 motorways are an effective and cost efficient way of increasing space on our roads , cutting jams and speeding up journey times and i am pleased to announce the start of work on these schemes			0

plans to reduce speed limits between 7am and 7pm for @entity44 dropped
lower speed limit ‘ must only apply when absolutely necessary ’
motoring groups hailed the decision as ‘ a victory for common sense . ’
