at long last , it may actually happen			0
@entity1 ’s first $ 200million spectacular			0
the mega-fight we ’ve all been waiting for			0
the most reliable hint thus far that @entity4 and @entity5 will finally get it on began rustling around the @entity9 rumour mill as the @entity5 flew into @entity10 from @entity11 in the early hours of monday morning , @entity12 time			1
book the date , at least provisionally : september 13 this year			1
the place : the @entity15 , @entity16			1
watch scroll down to see @entity5 beat @entity17 show him the money : @entity20 could be set for a mega-fight with @entity5 kings of the ring : @entity20 versus @entity5 has been pencilled in for september 13 in @entity16 we ’ve heard it all before but this time the word comes from close to @entity20 ’s @entity27			1
the same @entity29 source which revealed that @entity20 would fight @entity30 and @entity31 months before the official announcements of those bouts last year is claiming now that the biggest one of all is a done deal			2
@entity20 keeps his cards closer to his chest than a world poker champion			2
he continues to play games by asking his @entity41 followers to vote on who should be his next opponent			0
however , his date with @entity46 's @entity45 is expected to be confirmed any day			2
it has been in the works since october , as revealed by @entity49			0
not that it would be reasonable to expect him to disclose his plans for september before that fight , which is earmarked for the same @entity16 venue on may 3			1
@entity5 also has a hurdle of his own to overcome at the @entity57 , on april 5 , if the @entity20 bonanza is to have any chance of becoming reality			1
he is back in master - trainer @entity63 ’s @entity62 gym in @entity10 preparing to avenge the miscarriage of judging which gifted @entity66 a split decision victory over him 20 months ago			2
if @entity45 or @entity66 spring a major upset , it would derail the money train which is seemingly en route now to the biggest pay - night in ring history			1
but with the casino odds heavily against either of them losing this spring , @entity20 and @entity5 appear to be manoeuvring towards an autumn showdown which has been the best part of a decade in the making			1
@entity5 began clearing the decks by agreeing to @entity20 ’s demands for @entity80 blood - standard drugs testing as well as the lion ’s share of the purse			1
when his offer to accept just 40 per cent of the loot was followed by @entity20 ’s insistence that he cut his promoter , @entity86 , out of the deal , @entity5 upped the moral ante			1
in keeping with a proposition put in this column a few weeks in the wake of the typhoon disaster in the @entity96 , his home land in which he is eyeing a run for the presidency , @entity5 challenged @entity20 to fight him entirely for charity			1
the silence which has greeted that proposal thus far suggests that @entity20 may indeed be considering a negotiation which could include a slice of the huge proceeds going to good causes in @entity9 as well as the @entity96			2
another temptation for @entity20 to risk his cherished unbeaten record in a bid to seal his legacy of greatness – as well as bank an absolute fortune - has come with a perception in the @entity9 that @entity5 is in decline			1
revenge mission : @entity5 is first set for a rematch in april with @entity66 ( left ) , who beat him 20 months ago 1 ) @entity20 2 ) @entity5 3 ) @entity116 4 ) @entity66 5 ) @entity117 6 ) @entity118 7 ) @entity119 8 ) @entity120 9 ) @entity121 10 ) @entity122 the controversial defeat by @entity66 was followed by a shocking , one - punch ko by @entity5 ’s arch - rival @entity121 , whom @entity20 had beaten with ease			1
although @entity5 came back to out - class a tough young @entity17 , he failed to finish the job with the knock - out which used to be his trademark			2
even if @entity5 looks back to his best in the @entity66 re-match , the dye may already be cast by then for september			1
as recently as two years ago @entity132 would have been universally recognised as a duel between the two greatest pound - for - pound fighters in the world			0
that may well be the case by the time they do meet			0
@entity20 still reigns supreme and in my view @entity5 is back up there , just one place below him			2
but even if @entity5 is less than awesome against @entity66 , a clash with @entity20 would still be huge box office			1
@entity146 : @entity20 asked his @entity41 followers who he should fight next winner : @entity20 ( left ) lands a blow on @entity31 during his victory last september thumbs up : a deal is nearly done for @entity20 to fight @entity46 's @entity45 top of the bill in @entity154 but over-shadowed by @entity156 ’s second round starching of @entity157 , his fourth professional fall - guy , the hottest @entity160 prospect since @entity161 polished his credentials as a coming world title contender			1
@entity167 ’s sixth round stoppage of boxing bin - man @entity168 , himself a former world title challenger , added the @entity170 featherweight title to his @entity46 and @entity172 belt			2
also the @entity174 champion , @entity167 is closing in on world champion @entity175			2
@entity80 heavyweight champion @entity156 is as aware as anyone that he needs to step up in class now			0
to that end he is keeping commendably busy and seeking a tougher opponent in @entity180 on march 1			0
@entity181 : @entity167 ( left ) is the hottest @entity160 prospect since @entity161 the atmospheric mystique of prize - fighting has long held a fascination for artists , be they of the brush , the pen or the lens			1
a book published this week comes very much in the tradition of noble art - work as established by such authors and painters as @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197			0
in @entity198 the hard old game is seen through the oblique camera of @entity201 , principal lecturer at the esteemed photography degree course at @entity203			0
most memorable moment : @entity204 ( right ) was knocked out in round two by @entity206 in 2000 @entity207 deliberately eschews the glitz and glamour of the big fights in favour of the tough grind of the gym			0
his three prime subjects are not famed world champions but @entity204 , the @entity46 heavyweight most remembered for being knocked out by @entity206 , @entity218 , who is enjoying greater success as the head trainer of @entity122 and the @entity80 team than he did in the ring , and @entity223 , who lost all but one of the 70 fights which followed a failed challenge for the @entity229 light - middleweight title on his one big night in the limelight at @entity232 ’s @entity231			0
these are 120 fine - art photographs which it took @entity201 more than a decade to compile , many of them extreme close - ups of hard men and the raw paraphernalia of their severe work - place			0
the corner man : @entity218 ( left ) , has enjoyed success as a trainer to the likes of @entity122 ironically it is the diffused , soft - focus shots which transmit most hauntingly the grimy reality of the prize - fighter ’s life			0
publication is accompanied by exhibitions of these pictures in @entity252 and @entity12			0
the @entity198 , @entity201 , @entity253 , £ 30 / £ 45 hardback			0
exhibitions : now to april 21 new @entity256 , march 6 - 30 @entity257 – admissions is free .			0

@entity20 vs @entity5 pencilled in for september 13
the @entity15 in @entity16 is the proposed venue
@entity5 has a rematch against @entity66 on april 5
@entity20 close to agreeing a fight against @entity45
there 's a perception in @entity9 @entity5 is a *fading* force
@entity167 is the hottest @entity160 prospect since @entity161
