by @entity0 @entity1 is launching a chocolate bar aimed at women in an attempt to win back lost sales among the diet - conscious			1
the @entity7 is the first new chocolate bar launched by the company since the 1990s and will be backed by a £ 7million advertising campaign			1
industry research shows that annual sales of single chocolate bars have fallen by some 6.6 per cent in a market worth around £ 800million a year			2
revenge is sweet : @entity1 hope the @entity17 chocolate bar will reverse falling sales , especially among women evidence suggests that this slump is almost entirely caused by women buying less chocolate			1
@entity1 , owned by @entity25 food company @entity24 , believes the @entity7 will particularly appeal to women who are worried about putting on weight			2
the new bar comes in at 165 calories , compared with 260 for a @entity31 bar			1
the @entity7 , which is similar in taste and consistency to @entity35 chocolates , has three chocolate - covered wafer shells with a soft milk chocolate filling			0
it is designed with a resealable pack so it can be eaten one piece at a time			0
the @entity7 will be sold under the slogan ‘ a little treat for you ’ , on the basis that women can enjoy it without feeling guilty			0
the strategy of designing a chocolate bar specifically for one gender over another seems something of a throwback to the 1980s			0
guilt free : @entity1 hopes that women will be allured by the fact that the new chocolate bar has almost 100 less calories than a 260 calorie @entity31 bar the popular yorkie bars were advertised then under the enduring slogan ‘ it ’s not for girls ’ and featured manly truck drivers biting into the thick chunks			1
brand manager at @entity24 , @entity63 , said : ‘ @entity64 is a lighter way to enjoy the nation ’s favourite chocolate taste			0
’ earlier this year , @entity24 rival @entity31 launched @entity69 in the @entity70 , which is being sold as a lighter on - the - go chocolate snack			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ the mix of wafer and chocolate is a lighter way to eat chocolate and we know from experience that women are attracted to this particular format			1
‘ it will also appeal to women because it is in three separate portions so they can consume a little at a time rather than in one go			0
’ the 30g bar will go on sale on october 8 with a recommended price of 50p .			2

research suggest the drop in sales is *due* to women buying less chocolate
the new @entity17 bar is the first bar to be launched by @entity1 since the 90s and is targeted at women
the 30g bar will contain 165 calories
