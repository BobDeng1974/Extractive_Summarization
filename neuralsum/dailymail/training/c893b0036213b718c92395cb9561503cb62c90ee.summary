a software developer has created a workaround that lets an @entity3 owner see notifications on their @entity6 watch a major criticism of smartwatches is that the majority only work with specific brands and models of phone			1
and even those that can be used across multiple devices are limited to specific operating systems			0
but now , a software developer has created a workaround that lets an @entity3 owner see notifications on their @entity6 watch			1
a video by @entity23 - based @entity22 shows an @entity3 running @entity24 8 being paired with a @entity25 watch running @entity26			1
to create the hack , mr @entity22 used an @entity24 feature called @entity29 ( @entity29 )			1
in its developer library , @entity29 explained : ‘ the purpose of the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) is to give @entity33 accessories a simple and convenient way to access many kinds of notifications that are generated on @entity24 devices			1
‘ the @entity29 is designed around three principles : simplicity , efficiency and scalability			0
‘ as a result , accessories ranging from simple leds to powerful ‘ companion ’ devices with large displays can find the service useful			0
’ it is used by the @entity50 , as an example , to pair and show notifications on iphones and @entity54			0
in the short clip , a notification appears on mr @entity22 's @entity3 , the message app icon ‘ jumps ’ and then the notification appears on the watch shortly after			1
a video posted to @entity61 ( pictured ) by @entity23 - based @entity62 shows an @entity3 being paired with a @entity25 smartwatch			0
in the short clip , a notification appears on the @entity3 , the message app icon ‘ jumps ’ and then the notification appears on the watch shortly after mr @entity22 used a feature called @entity29 ( @entity29 )			1
it is used by the @entity50 ( left ) to show notifications on iphones and @entity54			0
when @entity29 launches its watch ( right ) the device will only connect with @entity29 products and it is unlikely the hack will work the other way to create the hack , mr @entity22 used an @entity24 feature called @entity29 ( @entity29 )			1
he then connected the devices using an @entity6 application kit ( @entity79 ) based on @entity6 ’s @entity33 software			0
he then used this app to wirelessly connect to the @entity29 on the @entity3			0
using this method , mr @entity22 used existing software and did n’t need to jailbreak the phone			2
currently mr @entity22 ’s hack is limited and only intercepts the notifications			2
the messages themselves ca n’t be opened or interacted with on the watch , but , it shows the potential for pairing @entity6 with @entity24			1
to connect the phones , mr @entity22 created an @entity6 application kit ( @entity79 ) designed around @entity6 ’s @entity33 software			1
he then used this app to wirelessly connect to the @entity29 on the @entity3			0
using this method , mr @entity22 used existing software and did n’t need to jailbreak the phone			2
jailbreaking is typically used to remove restrictions @entity29 places on its software and apps , but it can invalidate the warranty on the device			0
currently mr @entity22 ’s hack is limited to only intercepting the notification - the messages themselves ca n’t be opened or interacted with on the watch			2
but , it shows the potential for pairing @entity6 with @entity24			2
mr @entity22 has also not released the @entity79 yet and said on @entity61 : ‘ i ’m not sure whether to make it open source or not yet , but it ’s an @entity79 that needs to be installed on the watch			0
’ when @entity29 launches its watch next month the device will only connect with other @entity29 products and due to the firm 's restrictions , it is unlikely mr @entity22 's hack will work the other way .			2

@entity118 was carried out by software developer @entity22 - @entity22
he used an @entity24 feature called @entity29 ( @entity121 )
this allows @entity33 accessories to access @entity24 and show notifications
mr @entity22 created an app on his @entity3 using @entity26 code
when a message is received on the phone , it also appears on the watch
@entity118 is limited to intercepting notifications - the messages ca *n't* be viewed for example - but it shows the potential for pairing @entity6 with @entity24
