we wish him every success for the future			0

@entity0 's new role at @entity83 , where he will try to help the club improve on their miserable 15th place finish last season , may also allow him to continue his role as an @entity89 pundit			0
@entity0 's decision to snub this summer 's tournament in @entity33 is n't the first time he has turned down a @entity94 tough - tackling midfielder fell out with @entity18 boss @entity22 ahead of the 2002 @entity3 in @entity19 and @entity20 after being left unimpressed by his country 's preparation for the tournament			1
