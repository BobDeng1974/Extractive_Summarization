@entity0 dismissed claims that @entity3 ’s fragility has cleared the way for an @entity6 title challenge on sunday night			1
and he insisted his team are ‘ so good ’ that they should be winning every game they play in @entity10			1
with 19 matches played , the @entity12 side are four points adrift of their @entity16 rivals - and nine points worse off than at the same stage last year			1
@entity3 's @entity19 ( centre ) speaks to team - mate @entity21 during a training session in @entity23 @entity0 believes his side are ' so good ' they should win every single match they play in @entity10 in contrast , @entity6 - who have played two matches more - are five points better off than they were after the same number of games last season			1
adamant nonetheless that his team are going in the right direction , @entity0 claimed the @entity6 ’ form under @entity37 was a more significant factor than any perceived vulnerability or weakness in @entity3 ’s results			1
and while he applauded the @entity6 for embarking on an eight - match winning run , @entity0 believes that his own team should have won every one of their last 11 games , including their two slip - ups in december when they lost 2 - 1 to @entity48 at @entity49 and drew 0 - 0 with @entity50 at @entity12			1
‘ @entity6 have done very well , ’ said the @entity51			1
‘ it ’s not that we have been bad - they have been very good			1
‘ they have won eight games in a row - but in 11 ( league ) games we have only had one draw and one defeat			1
@entity6 currently sit top of the @entity63 , four points clear of @entity3 having played two matches more ‘ if you split things into two halves in the first eight games we had four victories , two draws and two losses			1
‘ now , in the last 11 , we have nine victories , one draw and one defeat			0
‘ and we should have won every one of those games			2
‘ so it ’s going in the right direction			0
we are in both cups and we have an important period coming up now			0
‘ i know there are high emotions taking over people , but we have to stay calm and believe in what we are doing			0
‘ we know we are performing well and have had good results in the last two months			2
we are going to keep that going			0
’ having played two games less than @entity6 , the destiny of the title remains in the champions ’ own hands			1
@entity0 sits in the dugout during his side 's friendly with @entity90 in @entity23 on saturday of the view that @entity3 , with superior financial and playing resources , should already have a comfortable lead , @entity0 added : ‘ we are so good we should win every game we play here in @entity10 , so when we lose i understand that people get irritated			1
‘ but if you win and keep on winning as we do now then @entity6 will have to be very good to beat us			1
‘ against @entity48 we did well in the first half			0
‘ i was not satisfied with the game against @entity50 , that was a poor game			2
i agree with the fans that was poor			0
we should have performed better , but even so we should have won the game			2
‘ we had enough chances to win it and that was a disappointing result			2
‘ otherwise i think we have played a lot of good games now			2
’ @entity19 ( centre ) puts his hand across his mouth as he goes another 45 minutes without scoring a goal the @entity12 boss regards the fitness of @entity115 as key to his side ’s success in the future , but fears that the winger ’s continuing injury problems mean the club may not see the best of him until next season			2
@entity0 says a fully - functioning @entity115 can be like having a new player in the ranks and the @entity10 international has embarked on a six - month project to cure his long - standing problems			1
‘ when we get him fully fit he will save us a lot of money , ’ said the @entity51			0
‘ i have a six - month project with him			2
if he can get consistency in his training we know he can be a top player			0
‘ he has n’t been that for a long time because of the injuries but we will see the best of him next season			0
i am not writing off this year , not at all , because he can be an important player for us			0
‘ he has the ability to beat a man and has great pace			0
we are looking for players who can be creative and we have a lot of options , but he can do that job for us			0
‘ he can open up defences			0
he will be like a new player next year			0
