@entity4 ’s next generation military drone has ‘ surpassed all expectations ’ in its first test flight			1
@entity5 , which is named after the @entity7 god of thunder , is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single - wing stealth design			1
it took to the air for the first time in august , but footage of the flight has only just been released			0
during tests , @entity5 ( pictured ) flew in a fully ' stealthy ' configuration , making it virtually invisible to radar @entity5 is the @entity4 's next generation military drone , named after the @entity7 god of thunder			1
it is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single - wing stealth design			1
the autonomous vehicle made its first test flight in august , when it took off , rotated , climbed and landed at various speeds and altitudes			2
@entity18 which made the aircraft , described it as ‘ the most advanced aircraft ever built by @entity4 engineers ’			1
@entity5 cost £ 185million to develop and was funded jointly by the @entity40 and @entity4 industry			0
the drone is around the same size as a @entity45 fighter jet and is the result of one - and - a - half million hours of work by @entity4 engineers from over 250 companies			0
the pilotless combat aircraft made ‘ a perfect take - off , rotation , “ climb out ” and landing on its first flight , ' according to @entity18 , which made the drone			1
the @entity4 defence firm described its largest drone as ‘ the most advanced aircraft ever built by @entity4 engineers ’ and test pilot @entity58 tried it out for a 15 minute flight at ‘ an undisclosed test range ’ in august			1
the advanced weapon , which could spearhead the fight against terror in @entity64 , cost £ 185million to develop and was funded jointly by the @entity4 mod and @entity4 industry			0
it made a number of flights last year at a variety of altitudes and speeds for periods of up to one hour , the company said			0
@entity5 ( graphic pictured ) is named after the @entity7 god of thunder and designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single - wing stealth design			1
during tests , @entity5 also used latest stealth communications systems to stay in touch with its commander without revealing its position the drone is around the same size as a @entity45 fighter jet and while it was first unveiled in july 2010 , it has not been seem flying before now , @entity86 reported			2
@entity5 is the result of one - and - a - half million hours of work by @entity4 engineers from over 250 companies , but only a select group have a lot of access to the secret aircraft			2
‘ @entity5 is providing vital insights that will help shape future capabilities for our @entity99 in coming decades			2
' its advanced technology is testament to the @entity4 's world leading engineering skills that keep @entity4 at the cutting edge of defence , ’ @entity101 , minister for defence equipment , support and technology said			0
military chiefs believe @entity5 ’ ground - breaking technology will allow a powerful new generation of drones equipped with deadly payloads to fly from @entity4 bases and attack targets worldwide			2
the new drone has made a number of flights last year at a variety of altitudes and speeds for periods of up to one hour , @entity18 said but the new developments in pilotless aircraft are controversial as they allow the possibility of autonomous computers targeting and killing enemy combatants outside human control			1
experts have previously warned that the new technology would potentially lead to a nightmarish scenario of out - of - control robots waging war on humans and have even called for a global ban on autonomous technology			0
@entity4 ’s armed drones are currently piloted remotely by aircrews on the ground , but @entity5 will follow a set flightpath using on - board computers to perform manoeuvres , avoid threats and identify targets			2
@entity5 , pictured in flight , is the result of one - and - a - half million hours of work by @entity4 engineers from over 250 companies , but only a select group have had a lot of access to the top secret aircraft only when it needs to attack a target will it seek authorisation from a human controller			1
‘ this is a very dangerous move			0
once it has been developed , who knows what new governments who inherit the technology will do with it , ’ professor @entity153 , a robotics engineer specialising in autonomous military systems at @entity155 , said last january			0
last year @entity163 warned that the fight against terrorism in @entity64 could last decades , meaning futuristic drones could dominate counter-terrorism strategy in the region			0
@entity4 forces operate armed drones in @entity171 , where they target @entity174 insurgents and the @entity175 has committed itself to a new generation of pilotless aircraft which can fly distances of more than 2,000 miles			1
military technology : a @entity182 @entity181 mq - 9 reaper drone takes off from @entity183 , @entity171			0
a proliferation in mainly @entity182 military technology has sparked a drone arms race			0

the drone made ‘ a perfect take - off , rotation , “ climb out ” and landing on its first flight , ' according to @entity18 , which made the pilotless aircraft
