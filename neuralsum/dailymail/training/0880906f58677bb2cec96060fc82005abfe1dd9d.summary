@entity0 stole the headlines against @entity2 on thursday when he fought off team - mates @entity3 and @entity5 to take the winning penalty			1
with the scores level after 84 minutes , @entity7 was fouled in the box and despite protestations from both @entity3 and @entity5 , @entity0 took the ball and scored from the spot			1
speaking on @entity14 , @entity13 said : ' @entity15 ( @entity3 ) should ’ve taken it			0
@entity0 and @entity18 fight over who should take a penalty for @entity21 against @entity22 then - @entity21 captain @entity23 steps in to drag a sulking @entity0 out of the way @entity18 then stares at @entity0 for some time before eventually taking the spot - kick ' i think @entity0 ’s been a bit mischievous by stepping in front of him and going against what the manager has planned before the game			1
' but for those who watched the @entity35 forward during his days at @entity21 , this was n't a surprising move			0
@entity0 attempted a similar tactic with @entity18 in a game against @entity22 in 2009			2
when a penalty was awarded , a teenage @entity0 tried to take the ball off of @entity18 , who was @entity21 's established penalty taker at the time			1
unfortunately for the enigmatic forward , his status in that squad did n't carry as much clout and he lost out to the @entity47 , having to be dragged away by @entity23			0
needless to say , @entity0 did not join in the celebrations after @entity18 scored			2
@entity3 , though , proved himself to be the bigger man and praised his team - mate after the game			0
he said : ' i wanted the penalty but @entity0 felt confident			2
he ’s taken big penalties before and it was great penalty in the end and a big goal for us			0
' of course everybody wanted to take it , but @entity0 ’s taken big penalties before and he got the nod			0
' @entity0 appears to tell @entity5 that he wants to take @entity64 's late penalty at @entity65 the @entity35 takes the ball off @entity3 and then converts the spot - kick @entity0 celebrates in front of the @entity64 fans after scoring from the spot to give his side victory			1

@entity64 beat @entity2 1 - 0 at @entity65 after @entity0 's late penalty
both @entity3 and @entity5 wanted to take the spot - kick
but @entity0 *disobeyed* @entity3 and took it himself
@entity0 attempted to do the same with @entity18 at @entity21
