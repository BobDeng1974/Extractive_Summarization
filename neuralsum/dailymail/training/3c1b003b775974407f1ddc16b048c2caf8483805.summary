by @entity1 reporter published : 06:05 est , 25 july 2012 updated : 06:40 est , 25 july 2012 three - year - old @entity2 has a rare condition that means he is blinded by light - and has to wear special heavy - duty sunglasses to help him see			1
parents @entity8 and @entity9 , have resorted to keeping their curtains closed at the family home in @entity12 , @entity13 , to help their son see their faces			2
@entity2 ’s condition , known as @entity17 , means he is also completely colour blind - and can only see the world in black and white			1
@entity8 , 35 , said her son may never see a sunrise or sunset because his eyes can not handle the light			0
@entity2 must wear special sunglasses to help him to see outside			1
at home the curtains are always closed @entity9 , 34 , a recruitment consultant , said : ' normal daylight to him is like the glare you get when you are driving on a wet day and sunlight reflects off the rainwater on the road			0
' we have to make everything as dark as possible for him to be able to see			0
' @entity17 is total colour blindness and is the rarest type of colour vision deficiency			1
children with the condition are born with faulty cone photoreceptors in the eye			2
this means they see everything in shades of black , white and grey			1
they have general poor sight with blurry central vision and are very sensitive to light			2
however , the condition does not get any worse as they grow older			2
they can use their outer vision to read and get around			2
@entity8 , 35 , added : ' when we first moved into our house we were worried the neighbours would just think we were really unfriendly , as we always had the curtains shut			0
' but we have to keep them closed to keep out as much sunlight as possible			0
' @entity2 puts on his prescription sunglasses when he gets up , and wears them until he goes to bed - they are designed to let only 10 per cent of light in			1
the condition means @entity2 struggles to play outside on bright days and he has to take cover from the rays			1
the family have had to deal with comments from passers - by who think @entity2 ’s dark glasses are a fashion statement			1
@entity8 said : ' it ’s frustrating because obviously he can hardly see without them , and in the beginning did worry about what people would think - a lot of people just think we put them on him to look cool			0
' thankfully most people are positive though , and say things like ‘ cool shades ’			2
' affecting just one in 35,000 people , the condition affects the retina meaning the cells responsible for colour and light sensitivity in the eye do n’t function			2
@entity9 and @entity95 play with their son with the curtains closed @entity9 and @entity8 have just found out their daughter @entity99 , 3months , has the same condition as @entity2 @entity2 was diagnosed with @entity17 at @entity102 , @entity103 , in december 2009 after his parents noticed he was having trouble focusing			1
they were initially assured this was down to a condition called @entity108 , but at seven months old they were told the devastating diagnosis			2
@entity9 said : ' we were shocked , and felt numb as we had n’t heard of the condition before			0
' as children so much is learnt through sight and observing things outdoors , such as wildlife in the trees or a plane in the sky			0
' with @entity2 we need to find other ways to show him so we use books and tv			1
' @entity2 wo n't be able to drive when he grows up but will attend mainstream school @entity2 ’s baby sister @entity99 , three months old , has also been diagnosed although she does n’t need special glasses yet , and can wear normal ones in bright light			1
@entity8 said : ' we were distraught when we first found out and it felt like we were going through a kind of grieving process because we knew they would n’t be able to see the world how we see it			0
' they ’ll never know though as they were born with the condition and we certainly wo n’t let it stop them doing what they want to do			0
' @entity2 now goes to @entity140 nursery run by the @entity141 , helping him to make the most of what little vision he has			1
his sight means he wo n’t ever be able to drive , and will need extra help in the classroom , although he will still attend a mainstream school			0
there is currently no treatment for the condition but both @entity2 and @entity99 are taking part in research for a cure , partly funded by the charity @entity155			1
dr @entity156 , consultant at @entity157 , @entity103 , said : ' @entity2 ’s activities will be restricted by his eyesight , and he will be less confident outdoors because of his extreme light sensitivity			1
' his vision is much worse in bright sunlight			0
' @entity8 said : ' it ’s quite difficult for @entity9 as he would love to teach @entity164 to play football but his sight makes co-ordination a bit difficult			0
' that does n’t mean he wo n’t try though , and we wo n’t let him dwell on what he will find difficult			0
