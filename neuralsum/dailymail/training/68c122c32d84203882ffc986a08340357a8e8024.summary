for the mother of the tormented teenager who wrote them , they must have been unbearable to read			1
the poem printed here was written by 14 - year - old @entity2 , who killed herself in september after suffering months of cruel taunts from fellow school pupils and internet trolls			1
yesterday her grieving mother @entity16 released the work to the public in the hope that her daughter ’s words might make other potential bullies think twice about their behaviour and perhaps prevent further tragedy			1
mrs @entity2 , who lives in @entity25 , @entity26 , said her daughter wrote the piece after attending a local music festival in july and returning home in floods of tears			1
called i give up , it reads : ‘ they begin to tell me that nobody wants me there			2
they tell me to leave and that i am not wanted			0
‘ i look down and walk , my eyes drowning in a sea of emotion			0
another piece of me chiselled away by their cruel remarks and perceptions			0
’ the poem was read out at the schoolgirl ’s funeral where it reduced many mourners to tears			1
mrs @entity2 said she decided to publish it to help people understand the pain and suffering caused by bullying and abuse on social media sites			1
she said : ‘ i know this may be uncomfortable for people but this is what was going on in my daughter ’s life before she died			1
in her own words , this is how she was feeling			0
’ she added : ‘ i want young people all around the world to think about the potential impact of their behaviour before they act			2
‘ we all need to be motivated by love and kindness , not nastiness and hate			0
’ mrs @entity2 has also called for the closure of the controversial website @entity70 , where @entity2 was abused by anonymous cyber bullies			2

‘ a lot of the bullying @entity2 was troubled over occurred on social media site @entity70			1
we want it closed down			0
heartbreak : schoolgirl @entity2 , 14 , with her mother @entity16 ‘ it gives cyber bullies a platform , allowing them to post hurtful comments and remain anonymous			1
’ mr @entity93 said : ‘ i know she is at least the tenth teenager to have taken her life because of it			0
