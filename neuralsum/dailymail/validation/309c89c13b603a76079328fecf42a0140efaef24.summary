it may not have the slick design of @entity3 's watch - or the extortionate price tag - but @entity5 is hoping its band fitness tracker and watch will rival the likes of @entity9 as well as the @entity10			2
@entity11 features sensors that track distance , pulse rate , calories , sleep quality and even @entity18 exposure , and it doubles up as a smartwatch to show notifications			1
it was released in the @entity21 last year but was only available in @entity22 in select locations			1
now its is available to pre-order in the @entity25 and goes on general sale on 15 april			1

it does n't let users make phone calls , but like other smartwatches such as the @entity10 , they can read texts , emails , social media updates and see other notifications on the touchscreen but unlike other smartwatches on the market , the @entity11 's battery life lasts more than two days - despite having a coloured screen , vibrations and is monitoring heart rate constantly			1
the wrist - worn device ( pictured left ) works alongside a health app called @entity87 ( shown on various devices ) but unlike other smartwatches on the market , the @entity11 's battery life lasts more than two days - despite having a coloured screen , vibrations and is monitoring heart rate constantly			1
and all of these features , stats and notifications can be customised on the @entity87 app that is n't tied to @entity5 's @entity99 and works across @entity100 and @entity101 as well			1
however , the @entity103 personal assistant feature is only available for people using a @entity106 8.1 device			0
through @entity87 , all of the data is stored in the cloud and can be given to doctors , physiotherapists or used for other clinical reasons			2
fitness functions : the band is primarily a fitness band			0
it features smart sensors that monitor pulse rate , measure calorie burn and track sleep quality			1
the device also offers workouts put together by @entity122 of @entity123 , for example , and gps route mapping so users can see where they have ran or cycled			0
@entity127 features : the device does n't allow people to make calls directly , but does push notifications about calls , texts and emails from a user 's smartphone to their @entity28			2
it has @entity5 's @entity103 personal assistant built - in so people can talk to the device to ask it to take notes or set reminders , for example			2
appearance : the band is made of rubber and features a colour touchscreen			2
users can change the background screen 's colour and design on the @entity87 app. app : @entity11 syncs with @entity87 and works with @entity154 , @entity100 and @entity99 handsets			1
it additionally syncs with other health and fitness devices and services such as @entity159 by @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			0
sensors : it has 10 sensors that monitor everything from heart rate and sleep to @entity18 , prompting wearers to apply sunscreen			1
@entity171 : $ 199 in the @entity21 and £ 169.99 in the @entity25			2
availability : it is available to pre-order today and goes on general sale on 15 april			1
for example , the sleep tracking function can highlight if someone is suffering from sleep apnoea - a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep - by tracking heart rate			1
@entity87 additionally syncs with other health and fitness devices and services such as @entity159 by @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			2
data from these different devices and services , such as steps , calories and heart rate can then be combined , enabling an ' @entity191 ' which reveals which exercises were most effective during a workout and suggest a recommended recovery time			1
this also shows detailed information about when a person entered the aerobic and anaerobic states during a workout to help people more accurately track their fitness or boost weight loss			0
over time , this data can be combined with a calendar to make the @entity205 smarter and offer suggestions for workouts that fit with a user 's schedule			0
the band is available for pre-order from @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 or via @entity215 and goes on general sale on 15 april			1
all of these features , stats and notifications can be customised on the @entity87 app ( pictured ) which is available across @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity99			1
this app additionally syncs with other health and fitness devices and services such as @entity159 by @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 there is a plethora of fitness trackers on the market , and an increasing number of smartwatches , but despite this competition @entity229 still manages to stand out			0
it 's not the best looking device , and by trying to cram in as many sensors as possible @entity5 appears to have forgotten that it needs to be worn for long periods of time			0
its stiff rubber band is uncomfortable and bulky and its clasp is not easy to do up one - handed			0
its green light , which reveals when the heart rate is being tracked , is also too bright - especially during the night , and when wearing it to sleep it ended up bruising my arm			1
however , its features more than make up for this shortcoming			0
@entity11 has many of the tools seen on other trackers and smartwatches but does them much better			0
not only does it track heart rate constantly , which helps give a more accurate representation of calories burnt , respiration and sleep than other devices , it also gives more detailed insights into all of your activity			1
@entity11 ( pictured ) is available for pre-order from @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 or via @entity215 for example , during sleep it reveals heart rate on a graph , tells you how long you slept and how much of this was classed as so - called restful sleep			1
it tracks your sleep efficiency and tells you how many calories were burnt as you were dozing			2
and during exercise this heart rate tracker plots when you entered aerobic or an anaerobic state , tells you how many calories were burnt during each stage and reveals how long you should recover before exercising again			2
the @entity274 section lets you pick and choose for a list of exercise routines and the band gently vibrates to tell you to move onto the next activity			0
this is preferable to watching a video or having audio beeps			0
these vibrations are also used to alert a user to @entity284 and @entity286 notifications , emails and text messages and a @entity290 button will show the text of these notifications word - by - word so you do n't have to scroll through on the small screen			1
@entity11 was the first wearable that stopped me reaching for my phone every 10 minutes or so			0
the only criticism of these sensors is that the pedometer , in particular , is a little sensitive and occasionally tracked single steps when driving in a car and hitting a pot hole or going over a speed bump			0
@entity5 claims the battery last for two days and during our tests it exceeded this			0
we ran a @entity309 on day one and walked an hour and 10 minutes on the second day , as well as received countless notifications and alerts and the phone lasted a staggering 53 hours on a single charge			0
this is even more impressive when you consider it is tracking heart rate constantly , and is used overnight during sleep			1
but the most impressive feature is the price			0
all of these features cost just £ 169.99 in the @entity25 and $ 199 in the @entity21			2
this is almost half the price of @entity3 's watch and $ 50 cheaper than the @entity10 in the @entity21 and £ 30 cheaper than the @entity324 in the @entity25			2
it 's not perfect , and the price reflects the poor design , but for a first foray into this industry its a decent effort			0
