around 3.8 million military veterans will miss out on disability compensation if the government shutdown continues into late october , it emerged today			1
and some 315,000 vets and 202,000 surviving spouses and dependents will see pension payments stopped , said @entity9 secretary @entity8			1
but as @entity8 prepares to testify wednesday in a @entity12 hearing about the federal budget stalemate 's impact on veterans services , a key @entity10 is demanding information about an expensive public relations campaign the agency has been running since before the shutdown began			1
@entity21 rep. @entity20 , who chairs the @entity22 , wrote to @entity8 on tuesday to fund out why his agency ' has continued to run a costly advertising campaign , including expensive television commercials during @entity27 games and @entity29 playoffs			2
' ' it appears , ' @entity20 contends , ' that @entity9 spent more than $ 1 million on television advertisements from september 9th through october 13 , 2013 , in the @entity33 metro area alone			1
' but the ad does n't discuss specific va benefits , nor does it refer to the shutdown			2
it tells the story of a female veteran who thanks the agency , vaguely , for helping her grandparents and great - grandparents after they retired from active military duty			0
' every generation of my family has served , and @entity9 has served us all , ' the ad 's voice - over says			1
in a separate inquiry , @entity74 @entity73 sen. @entity73 has demanded to know how the @entity9 justified spending $ 526,000 on artwork at the end of the fiscal year , as shutdown fears loomed largest			2
despite its ability to afford the pricey ad blitz and the artwork , the @entity9 now blames shutdown - related furloughs for what it expects will be an increased backlog in processing disability claims			1
an agency spokesperson said in a statement that it would no longer be able to assign workers to ' overtime that has helped @entity9 significantly reduce the disability claims backlog by more than 190,000 claims over the last six months			1
' the agency has required its claims processors to work at least 20 hours of overtime ever month since taking a more aggressive approach to the problem in mid-may , according to @entity99			0
@entity9 secretary @entity8 , a retired @entity100 four - star general , is facing criticism for heavy spending on nonessential plans like tv ad blitzes and artwork purchases while his agency faced the same shutdown - related cuts as other government offices demanding answers : rep. @entity20 ( @entity111 ) and sen. @entity73 ( r ) want to know why the @entity9 is spending heavily on fluff while leaving hundreds of thousands of veterans ' disability claims in a backlog file between the overtime strategy and a new paperless claims system , the backlog of 611,000 cases in march shrunk to about 418,500 when the partial government shutdown kicked in			1
7,000 of the furloughed workers were posted at the @entity124 , and the rest were employed at the @entity9 ’s @entity126 , which runs the more efficient paperless system			0
@entity129 resident @entity128 , a @entity130 corporal who served four years before a training accident left him disabled last year , held an all - night , all - day vigil on a freeway overpass this week with an upside down @entity137 flag -- a signal of distress while programs assisting veterans slow to a crawl , regional offices are shuttered and the backlog in those disability claims trends in the wrong direction , a stalemate has brought one house of @entity149 to act and the other to sit on its collective hands			1
as the shutdown took shape a week ago , @entity10 in the @entity12 began executing a plan to fund a dozen popular parts of the federal government through separate budget measures , while leaving more contentious programs for later negotiations			1
the @entity9 was the subject of one of those bills			0
224 @entity10 and 35 @entity162 approved the legislation and sent it to the @entity165 - controlled @entity164			1
but despite bipartisan support for the resolutions – others included funding for @entity170 , the @entity171 , and nutrition for @entity174 programs – the @entity175 has threatened vetoes and senate majority leader @entity177 has declined to bring them up for votes			0
' consideration of appropriations bills in a piecemeal fashion is not a serious or responsible way to run the @entity182 , ' read a @entity175 statement issued oct. 2			0
president @entity184 did , however , sign into law a @entity10 - backed measure guaranteeing the paychecks of active - duty servicemen and women during the partial shutdown			2
his signature came two hours before the spending freeze took effect			0
and sen. @entity194 , the fiery @entity196 conservative , said tuesday that such ' piecemeal ' funding measures are ' the traditional means of appropriating and legislating that for centuries this [ @entity164 ] has done			0
' he also said funding soldiers ' paychecks and veterans ' benefits should go hand - in - hand			0
' if we could work together in a bipartisan manner to say we 're not going to hold the men and women of the military hostage , ' @entity194 asked , ' why ca n't we work together in a bipartisan manner to say we 're not going to hold our veterans hostage ? ' veterans made their voices heard on oct. 2 after @entity217 erected barricades to block access to national parks and memorials			2
some republicans have claimed the @entity184 administration made the shutdown as inconvenient as possible in order to inspire @entity137 to demand a quick resolution sen. @entity194 talked with @entity38 veterans at their outdoor memorial on tuesday in @entity33			2
he snapped at @entity162 for holding veterans ' hostage ' in the prolonged budget fight @entity164 @entity162 have joined @entity184 in holding out for a more comprehensive solution , a so - called ' clean continuing resolution ' that would fund the entire government at once , with no strings attached			1
@entity236 house speaker @entity236 has refused to bring that measure to the floor because his conference requires one very specific string : language that would change portions of the @entity243 that the @entity10 finds objectionable			0
president @entity184 continued to play tough on tuesday , telling republicans he would refuse to negotiate over government spending until they had surrendered and reinstated funding across the board no @entity10 lawmaker voted in favor of the act , better known as the @entity243 law , when it passed in march 2010			2
and president @entity184 has made several changes to the law without consulting @entity149			0
@entity10 say one such change , a year - long delay in the law 's requirement that businesses offer their employees health insurance plans , should be matched by a similar delay in the law 's provision that requires individual taxpayers to sign up for coverage			0
while the two sides duke it out on the political stage , the individual program funding bills languish in the @entity164 , with republicans crying foul and @entity162 insisting on an all - or - nothing endgame			1
tuesday 's statement from the @entity9 , itself an arm of the @entity184 administration , demanded the latter approach			0
' @entity278 progress for veterans and their families is at risk , ' it read , ' without immediate action by @entity149 to make fiscal year 2014 funding available by passing a clean continuing resolution to reopen the government			0
' the @entity9 also warned that more basic services like payments related to ' pension , education and vocational rehabilitation programs ' could be suspended after late october ' when available funding is exhausted			1
' the agency 's most visible program – its hospitals and other health - care delivery operations – will be immune from the shutdown axe since they 're considered ' essential ' services .			0

around 3.8 million military veterans will miss out on disability payments if shutdown continues to late october
and some 315,000 vets and 202,000 surviving spouses and dependents will see pension payments stopped
but veterans affairs secretary @entity8 is in the hot seat for green - lighting *massive* feel - good ad blitzes while the shutdown loomed
one @entity137 senator wants to know why the @entity9 spent more than a half - million *dollars* on fine art in the final days before oct. 1
the agency now says the shutdown has slowed its processing of disability claims by forcing nearly *10,000* furloughs
@entity12 @entity10 have passed a *standalone* bill restoring full funding for veterans programs , but @entity164 @entity162 wo n't consider it
