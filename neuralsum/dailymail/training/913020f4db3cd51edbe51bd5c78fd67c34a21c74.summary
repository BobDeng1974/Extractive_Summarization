by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail it is a disservice to both competitions to compare the @entity3 — the ‘ @entity5 ’ — to the @entity4 , but there is one legacy of @entity8 that is very much alive in @entity10			1
the @entity11 are desperate to forget about their embarrassing performance two years ago , when they finished a lowly 10th in the medals table			0
beset by in - fighting and lacking discipline , they won only seven golds as @entity17 plundered 29 to finish third overall			0
the @entity19 have , therefore , suddenly become very important for @entity11 as a great sporting nation attempts to rebuild towards the @entity4 in 2016			2
@entity11 need a strong performance at the @entity19 after being embarrassed at @entity8 where once the @entity5 might have been a chance to impress @entity11 ’s might on fellow @entity19 countries , there is now considerable pride at stake			1
the 2018 games will take place on the @entity31 , and @entity11 has topped every medals table at the @entity3 since 1986			1
the country ’s chef de mission , @entity33 , wants 111 medals as a minimum in @entity10 , although he has admitted @entity11 will have their ‘ work cut out just to win the medal tally , let alone dominate it ’			1
@entity40 are very different to the weakened team that arrived in @entity42 in 2010			0
many of their high - profile stars stayed at home rather than risk their safety and security just two years from @entity8			0
but the @entity19 just across the border is a very different matter			0
@entity40 , for example , have won three golds , a silver and a bronze as they dominated the men ’s , women ’s and mixed team medley events in triathlon while @entity11 have had to make do with a bronze			1
@entity61 helped @entity40 dominate the triathlon with three golds while @entity11 won only a bronze shooter @entity65 has a chance to overtake @entity11 @entity69 ' record @entity19 medal haul @entity11 shooter @entity69 , the most decorated @entity19 athlete , also now has an @entity40 for company after 60 - year - old grandfather @entity74 won a bronze in the 10m air pistol yesterday			1
@entity65 now has the opportunity to go one clear of @entity69 and win his 19th medal in the 50m air pistol			2
yet in the pool and on the track cycling , some things never change			0
@entity11 @entity83 has already won the 500m time trial and will face compatriot @entity85 as she bids for her six @entity19 title in the women ’s sprint			2
the double @entity4 champion , 30 , looked as imperious as ever on saturday as she swatted aside @entity40 ’s @entity90 in her semi-final			0
@entity11 won the first seven races of the evening session inside the sir @entity95 velodrome , including gold for @entity97 in the 10k scratch race			0
the @entity11 , whose mother @entity99 grew up in @entity101 , gained revenge over @entity40 ’s @entity103 , who beat her comprehensively in the individual pursuit final on friday , and led an @entity11 one - two ahead of @entity105			1
@entity107 ’ @entity106 was third			0
some things never change : @entity83 is bidding for her sixth @entity19 title in the sprint the day had begun with a thrilling contest between @entity11 and @entity40 in the group stage of the netball , with the team in green and gold sneaking a 49 - 48 win in the last 30 seconds			1
netball has been dominated by @entity11 and @entity118 , the highest ranked teams in the world , since it was introduced into the @entity3 in 1998 , but @entity40 still maintain this is their chance to improve on their three bronze medals to date			1
@entity124 ’s side thrashed @entity11 3 - 0 in a test series last year , but the doubts resurfaced yesterday as @entity40 squandered a 16 - 10 lead and suffered a crushing defeat by an aggressive @entity11 side			2
it does not make @entity40 ’s dream of gold impossible , but life will be harder given @entity118 are the likely semi-final opponents for the team finishing second in this group			0
with the scores level at 48 - 48 after going with the centre pass , @entity40 goal shooter @entity136 , one of the five @entity40 women who play in @entity11 and @entity118 ’s semi-professional @entity139 , failed to convert a shot at goal			1
@entity145 dreams : @entity146 fought to a narrow 49 - 48 victory over @entity40 in the basketball crying game : @entity40 's @entity136 is left in tears after @entity11 's late vitory @entity11 raced to the other end and @entity152 scored her 36th goal of the morning to claim victory , leaving @entity136 in tears			1
@entity40 goalkeeper @entity156 said : ‘ we ’re still serious contenders			0
i ’m very excited by this team and i know we can go all the way			0
’ @entity40 ’s @entity159 was unable to claim a podium place as @entity11 @entity161 took gold by setting a new @entity5 record of 1min 0.675secs in the final race of the 1000m time trial .			2

@entity11 need to return to former glories at the @entity19
they were embarrassed at @entity8 , leaving with only seven golds
@entity11 will stage the 2018 @entity19 on the @entity31
@entity40 have dominated the triathlon event with the @entity61 *brothers*
@entity65 could beat @entity69 ' record medal haul in @entity10
@entity11 narrowly beat @entity40 49 - 48 in the netball
