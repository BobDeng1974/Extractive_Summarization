by @entity0 published : 12:15 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 20:04 est , 13 november 2013 the bill for winter fuel payments to @entity4 pensioners living abroad has soared by 70 per cent in a year , thanks to a @entity7 court ruling			1
as millions of elderly people in the @entity4 face a cold winter and inflation - busting rises to their energy bills , it was revealed that a record £ 21million was paid last year to expats living in sunnier climes such as @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
it came as new figures from energy watchdog @entity20 showed that record numbers of @entity22 were in arrears on their fuel bills			0
the number of winter fuel payments made overseas has rocketed in the last decade , with sharp rises in @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity28 in the last year work and pensions secretary @entity29 yesterday said the decision by the @entity31 was ‘ ridiculous ’ as his department revealed its staggering cost			1
the bill soared from £ 12.8million in 2011/12 after judges ruled that anyone with a ‘ sufficient link ’ to @entity4 could claim the £ 200 - £ 300 allowance			1
‘ the huge increase in @entity4 winter fuel payments equates to a near doubling in costs to the @entity4 taxpayer and that is wholly unacceptable , ’ he said			1
‘ it is not fair and it ’s not something this government is going to tolerate			2
‘ this increase is a direct result of a ridiculous ruling by the @entity31 and we are not prepared to sit back and allow hard - working taxpayers money to be used in this way			2
’ previously , expats had to be resident in @entity4 until they were 60 before they could claim the benefit , but the ruling allows people who lived or worked in @entity4 for most of their lives to qualify			0
anger : work and pensions secretary @entity29 said it was ' ridiculous ' that @entity4 money was being sent overseas last year , 49,443 pensioners living in @entity14 alone – where temperatures in december and january can reach @entity66 ( @entity67 ) – received £ 8.8million			1
last year , the allowance was claimed by nearly 120,000 people living in the @entity70			0
it is estimated that the @entity7 judges ’ ruling allowed up to 440,000 expats to claim the payment			0
however , from 2015 pensioners living in countries with an average winter temperature higher than the warmest part of the @entity4 will be unable to claim , excluding around 100,000 expats			2
there has been deepening controversy over the growing bill in so - called ‘ sunshine benefits ’ to expats , which are costing the taxpayer around £ 2million a week			1
around 12million pensioners in @entity4 receive the winter fuel payment , but critics – including mr @entity29 and @entity90 – have called for it to be limited to poorer people who need help to meet their fuel bills			1
however , @entity94 has promised to protect the payments – which are worth £ 200 to a household with someone aged over 60 , and £ 300 for those aged over 80 – until 2015			2
the news came as figures from @entity20 showed that @entity22 are more likely to be in arrears on their power bills than families in other parts of the @entity4			0
some 6.1 per cent of gas users and 5.9 per cent of electricity users are in debt to energy firms , compared with a @entity4 average of 5 per cent			0
heating : expats living on the @entity112 are among 50,000 people in @entity14 to share £ 8.9million in @entity4 taxpayer help with their winter fuel bills at the end of 2012 , a total of 153,201 @entity22 households owed money on their electricity bills and 119,125 on their gas accounts			1
with the average bill set to hit a record £ 1,500 , many will face a growing battle to keep the heating on			2
the number of households repaying arrears on gas bills has soared by 11 per cent in two years			0
a spokesman for trade body @entity133 , said : ‘ energy suppliers take seriously their responsibilities for helping vulnerable customers , and customers in debt , targeting appropriate support to meet individual circumstances			0
it follows recent announcements by the @entity145 energy firms of rises to bills of up to 10 per cent			0
@entity148 was the latest to announce its increases yesterday , saying that both gas and electricity prices would rise by 3.9 per cent in january .			0
