@entity0 was left holding his wing mirror during practice for sunday 's @entity4 @entity3			1
the bizarre incident took place on the opening morning of practice with just 20 minutes gone after the @entity10 's left wing mirror broke free at turn four			2
@entity0 managed to grab the faulty wing mirror after it entered his cockpit - which narrowly missed his helmet - before returning to the @entity16 garage			1
catch me if you can : @entity0 was left holding his wing mirror after it forced its way loose during practice swing when you 're winning : the wing mirror came off @entity0 's @entity16 with 20 minutes of the session gone entering the cockpit : the woing mirror narrowly missed @entity0 's helmet after it swung loose the former @entity29 driver , who reported the fault over the team radio , had to driver the remainder of the lap with one hand			1
' well , that 'll take some attention in the pits , ' @entity16 wrote on their @entity40 page			2
' just a quick fix for @entity0 and he 'll be straight back on track ! ' @entity0 , who scored @entity16 's first podium since 2009 at april 's @entity44 , ended the opening session in ninth place with a time of 1:28.779 â€“ 1.6 seconds adrift of pacesetter @entity48 in his @entity50			1
on track : @entity48 was fastest in the opening session for this week 's @entity4 @entity3 despite signs of improvement for @entity29 in @entity4 after @entity56 posted the second fastest time on friday morning , the @entity53 fears @entity50 will face little opposition to their current dominance before @entity60 's summer break			2
with @entity48 and @entity62 , fifth quickest on friday morning , at the wheel , @entity50 have so far crushed the opposition , claiming all four poles , race victories , as well as leading every lap. ' @entity50 do n't have any competition			0
they are so far in front of the field , ' said @entity56			0
' in @entity72 ( in a fortnight ) you might see @entity73 be strong and give them a run for their money , but apart from that it 's going to be very tricky for anyone to challenge them over the next six or seven races			0
' @entity50 will also keep developing throughout the year , and whilst we - and every other team - is trying to catch up , they 're not going to stand still			0
they 're going to upgrade the car			0
