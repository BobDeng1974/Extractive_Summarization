@entity1 militants fighting in @entity2 and @entity3 have released an audio message they claim is of terror leader @entity5 urging supporters to unleash a ' volcano of jihad ' on the @entity9			1
lacing his speech with religious phrases , the voice believed to belong to @entity14 describes jihad as ' the peak of @entity17 ' and said those who do not fight non-believers will suffer ' painful torment			1
' the release - which has not been independently verified - comes just days after @entity3 officials claimed the @entity24 chief had at least been injured and may very well be dead after an @entity26 airstrike destroyed a convoy of up to 10 vehicles that was travelling through the country			1
the bombing killed @entity32 's right hand man @entity31 , who is commonly known by his @entity33 , but there have been conflicting reports about the terror leader himself - with @entity26 officials admitting that even they were stumped as to his fate			1
' we see @entity26 and it 's allies stumbling between fear , weakness , inability and failure			1
@entity26 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , their apostate tails and slaves from among the rulers of the @entity69 lands were terrified of the @entity1 , ' he said			2
' they fear for their security			0
they fear the revolt of the @entity69 peoples			0
they fear the return of the caliphate and the return of @entity69 to pioneering and leadership , ' he added			0
making specific reference to @entity86 partners in the @entity26 - led coalition of nations carrying out airstrikes against the @entity1 , the voices goes on : ' @entity26 did not dare start a campaign until after amassing support from their slaves and dogs from among the rulers of @entity17 lands			1
' he goes on to praise @entity17 extremists in the @entity98 and @entity99 , describing them as the ' fuel ' of jihad but demanding they do not allow @entity103 and moderate @entity69 ' security and happiness for as long as you have a blinking eye and a pulsing vein			1
' militant : before the audio release , @entity5 ( shown before his rise to power ) was thought to have been injured or possibly even killed during an @entity26 air raid last week the statement was posted online six days after @entity3 officials claimed that @entity5 had been wounded in an airstrike			1
it is not clear whether the recording was made before or after the incident			0
in the recording , @entity5 vowed to fight the ' crusader campaign ' to the bitter end			1
' @entity119 has ordered us to fight , ' he said			0
' for that reason the soldiers of the @entity1 are fighting ... they will never leave fighting , even if only one soldier remains			0
they will never leave fighting , because they reject humiliation			0
' the recording , released on social media networks , appeared authentic , and the voice appeared to match that in previous recordings released by the group			0
the self - styled caliph called on @entity69 to wage holy war everywhere , and to attack and kill ' apostates ' in @entity137 and @entity138 specifically			0
an earlier audio recording from @entity32 is believed to have inspired militants in @entity141 to kill and behead a @entity143 national			0
attacks : the audio release - which has not been independently verified - comes just days after @entity3 officials claimed the @entity24 chief had at least been injured and may very well be dead after an @entity26 airstrike destroyed a convoy of up to 10 vehicles that was travelling in @entity151 along the @entity2 - @entity3 border one interesting aspect of recording is that the man believed to be @entity14 urges militants to focus on defeating their enemies at a local level before battling ' @entity160 ' forces from the @entity9			1
that comment is a clear indication that @entity14 's immediate priority is to expand the area under the control of his so - called caliphate , rather than simply encouraging @entity169 - style terror attacks			2
the speech was not dated but carried a reference to a november 7 @entity26 announcement that president @entity173 had approved sending up to 1,500 more @entity26 troops to @entity3			2
' o sons of @entity180 [ @entity137 ] ... the serpent 's head and the stronghold of the disease are there ... draw your swords and divorce life , because there should be no security for the @entity187 , ' he @entity5 said , using a derogatory term to refer to the leadership of @entity137			2
@entity1 has seized swathes of @entity2 and @entity3 , declaring a caliphate over territory it controls in june			2
@entity5 said he had accepted oaths of allegiance from supporters in @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity138 , @entity137 and @entity141 , adding : ' oh soldiers of the @entity1 ... erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere			2
light the earth with fire against all dictators			0
' global threat : @entity24 has seized swathes of @entity2 and @entity3 declaring a caliphate over territory it controls in june @entity210 strikes : the reports say that @entity26 warplanes dropped bombs on the town of @entity151 in @entity3			1
pictured is an earlier strike against @entity24 in @entity217 , on the @entity219 - @entity2 border following last week 's claims @entity5 had been killed , @entity24 members took to social media to argue that the terror leader had not been traveling in the same convoy that killed @entity225			1
other sources stated that senior militants and their tribal allies had informed them that @entity14 had been either seriously injured or killed in the @entity26 airstrike			1
an @entity3 security official , @entity230 claimed that @entity225 was ' @entity32 's very close companion ' and was killed in the attack which destroyed up to 10 vehicles			0
' he and @entity5 were rarely separate			2
it 's for this reason that it could be possible that @entity14 was with him at the time of the attack , ' he said			0
@entity230 revealed that @entity31 's death was confirmed to him by relatives .			0
