a million - pound holiday home could be under threat after huge cracks and steps appeared up to a quarter of a mile inland on the @entity4 after months of appalling weather			1
the expensive bungalow west of @entity7 in @entity8 is surrounded by hundreds of acres of unstable land slumping slowly seawards because billions of tons of rock and mud are on the move			1
a three - foot step has been cleaved across the road from the property - even though it is some distance from the sea - as seven miles of the beautiful @entity19 has been closed around it			1
in peril : massive cracks have appeared along the @entity23 between @entity24 and @entity7 putting this £ 1million property in danger dangerous : the fossil rich @entity4 cliffs at @entity28 in @entity8 has been slipping into the sea for two weeks causing massive land movements for miles around them scale : cracks have been ripping through fields and pathways as the heavy rain has caused miles of coastline to slip dangerously @entity7 residents are used to seeing the @entity4 's sea - cliffs fall spectacularly into the pounding waves - but now cracks and fissures are opening as far as a third of a mile inland of the coast along the famous @entity23			1
subsidence is the movement of the ground and is caused by changing moisture levels , either when the soil dries out or water levels increase rapidly			1
this movement is uneven and sudden , causing damage such as cracks in walls , ceilings and floors of buildings			1
an upward movement of the ground – known as heave – can then occur when dried soil becomes saturated			2
trees planted close to properties are often a cause of subsidence as they suck up moisture under the foundations			2
signs in homes include diagonal cracks , wider at the top , by windows or doors			1
in serious cases , underpinning may be required			2
the clue is in the name - this is a dynamic landscape which used to be part of the seabed during @entity82 times when tidal levels were far higher than they are now			0
ancient sea - cliffs along this part of the coast can be seen perched over 350 feet above today 's high water mark - the landscape beneath them is merely reacting to gravity now that heavy rains have lubricated subterranean seams			1
@entity94 experts are keeping ' a close eye ' on the situation but admit there is little that anyone can do to save the seaward acres on the @entity101 border			1
' a lot of rain means a lot of landslide activity , ' said @entity94 geologist @entity106 , an expert on the @entity4			1
' the @entity108 area is part of the undercliff - and the whole length of that coast is a series of landslides			1
' what 's happening there now is all linked to what we saw last year when the beach huts on @entity28 were destroyed , ' he explained			0
' we are keeping a very close eye on it - but this is a landslide not a rockfall , ' mr @entity120 went on			1
' people along this coast are used to seeing rockfalls which drop dramatically into the sea - but a landslide like this happens slowly			1
' and there is usually a delay between the time when the rains stop and the activity occurs - this could become more active in april , may or even june			0
' evasive action : @entity94 experts are keeping ' a close eye ' on the situation but admit there is little that anyone can do to save the seaward acres on its border with @entity144 retired @entity7 harbour - master @entity145 lives close to the @entity147 area and said an extensive chalet - style holiday home which was recently bought for just under £ 1 million was in danger			1
he said : ' i walk here most days and i can tell you the house has sunk over two feet in the past fortnight			0
' evidence : witnesses to the landslips say that a whole tree slid down the cliff face and stayed perfectly upright on the beach below			0
geologists are risking injury to get near the cliffs as ammonite fossils are appearing a large crack has opened across the gravel drive just feet from the home 's front door while just feet away a telegraph pole , dislodged by earth movement , is resting at an alarming angle			0
@entity172 of the home massive cracks in the ground had opened up across paddocks , and areas of paddock and field had dropped to form large steps in the landscape			1
the most damaging of these divides an access road where an abrupt , vertical , three - foot drop now cleaves the lane in two			0
cracks and fissures large and small had been opening up across many acres			2
' it 's all become a lot , lot worse in the past two weeks , ' commented mr @entity145			0
exactly the same scenario could have been witnessed on the altogether busier and more populated eastern side of @entity7 if local authorities not decided to spend £ 24 million on large scale engineering works which are presently underway to bolster the seaward landscape there			0
the scheme is the fourth stage of a ground stabilisation programme staged in a bid to halt the ' landslide zone ' on which @entity7 is built			2
the current phase is aimed at protecting around 240 homes and a substantial section of the main @entity204			0
even that massive expenditure , however , is no guarantee when it comes to the long - term future of @entity7 : ' it 's been designed to protect the town for 60 years , ' said mr @entity106			0
' but no one can say what will happen after that			0
this is a dynamic coastline			0
' just east of the present engineering works an area called @entity216 has , for decades , said to have been the ' largest and most studied landslide complex in @entity218 '			2
' the amazing thing is that this is all happening in one human lifetime , ' said mr @entity120 , explaining that in geological terms this was lightning fast			0
' for example , there used to be a road leading to @entity204 around @entity216 but in the 1920s it disappeared			0
in 1959 that area saw the largest coastal landslide ever seen in this country			2
' it could now be that the western edge of @entity7 could also find itself in the geographical record books			0
if the cracks and fissures continue to open up , it might soon be the largest chunk of the @entity238 to disappear since its neighbouring landscape vanished 55 years ago			1
scary : the cracks have started appearing along this stretch of coastline west of @entity7 , and are reaching up to a quarter of a mile in and closing the famous @entity244			2

seven miles of paths along the @entity8 coast have been shut as huge cracks have appeared because of landslide
experts say *problems* have been caused by the months of *torrential* rain and storms that hit @entity238
