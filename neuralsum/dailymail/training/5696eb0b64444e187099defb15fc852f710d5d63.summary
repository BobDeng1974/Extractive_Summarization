by @entity0 published : 10:19 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 12:49 est , 28 january 2013 almost 150 years after it failed to return to port after its successful maiden mission , experts believe they may have finally solved the mysterious loss of the @entity8 submarine @entity9 during the @entity10			1
scientists at @entity13 's @entity12 in @entity14 are set to publish their findings today on why the first submarine in history to sink an enemy warship perished along with its target in the waters off @entity21 in 1864			1
located in 1995 and raised five years later to be placed in a controlled environment to preserve it , speculation around the loss of the revolutionary submarine centers on the very explosives it planted on the @entity30 blockade ship @entity31			2
the pole , called a spar , was once placed at the front of the sub and used to place a powder charge into the @entity46 , but the @entity47 went down with its eight man crew and never returned on february 17th 1864			1
and earlier this month , the submarine was unveiled in full and unobstructed for the first time on thursday , capping a decade of careful preservation			2
' no one alive has ever seen the @entity9 complete , ' said engineer @entity54 as the crane at the @entity57 conservation laboratory slowly lifted a massive steel truss covering the top of the submarine on january 12th			1
scientists say a pole on the front of the @entity8 submarine @entity9 designed to plant explosives on enemy ships may hold a key clue to its sinking during the @entity10 the @entity31 was sunk by the @entity9 in february of 1864 off the coast of @entity67 about 20 engineers and scientists applauded as they caught the first glimpse of the intact 42 - foot - long narrow iron cylinder , which was raised from the ocean floor near @entity57 more than a decade ago			1
the public will see the same view but in a water tank to keep it from rusting			0
' it 's like looking at the sub for the first time			0
it 's like the end of a long night , ' said @entity80 , senior conservator since 1999 of the project to raise , excavate and conserve the @entity9			1
in the summer of 2000 , an expedition led by adventurer @entity83 raised the @entity9 and delivered it to the conservatory on @entity57 's old @entity87 base , where it sat in a 90,000 - gallon tank of fresh water to leech salt out of its iron hull			1
on weekdays , scientists drain the tank and work on the sub			0
on weekends , tourists who before this week could only see an obstructed view of the vessel in the water tank , now will be able to see it unimpeded			0
considered the @entity87 's stealth weapon , the @entity47 sank the @entity30 warship @entity46 in winter 1864 , and then disappeared with all eight @entity8 sailors inside			1

in the ensuing few months , it sank twice after sea trial accidents , killing 13 crew members including @entity120 , who was steering			0
' there are historical references that the bodies of one crew had to be cut into pieces to remove them from the submarine , ' said @entity80			2
' there was forensic evidence when they found the bones ( between 1993 and 2004 in a @entity8 graveyard beneath a football stadium in @entity57 ) that that was true			0
' the @entity87 hauled the sub up twice , recovered the bodies of the crew , and planned a winter attack			0
on the night of february 17 , 1864 , its captain and seven crew left @entity150 near @entity57 , and hand - powered the sub to the @entity30 warship four miles offshore			1
a schematic of the submarine shows the rudimentary system of propulsion via levers senior conservator @entity80 looks at the x-ray of a portal on the @entity9 ( left ) while an interior view of the @entity10 submarine shows the crank shaft for propulsion a concretion layer covers the hand crank that crew members powered the @entity10 submarine @entity9 from a metal spar on its bow , the @entity47 planted a 135 - pound torpedo in the hull of the ship , which burned and sank			1
before the collision , a lookout on the @entity46 spotted a bizarre vessel approaching just below the surface — with only its coning tower visible — and sounded the alarm			0
the @entity46 's cannons could n't be lowered enough to fire at the strange craft , so crewmen used rifles and pistols , but these were not effective			0
some historians say that the submarine showed a mission - accomplished lantern signal from its hatch to troops back on shore before it disappeared			1
soon after the signal had been fired , the sub sank about 4 miles ( 6.4 kilometers ) off @entity57 , where the @entity9 remained for 136 years			1
@entity80 has the lantern , which archaeologists found in the submarine more than a century later , in his laboratory			2
scientists removed 10 tons of sediment from the submarine , along with the bones , skulls and even brain matter of the crew members , explained @entity80			2
they also found fabric and sailors ' personal belongings			0
facial reconstructions were made of each member of the third and final crew			0
they are displayed along with other artifacts in a museum near the submarine			2
in a nearby vault is a bent gold coin that archaeologists also found in the submarine			2
it was carried by the sub 's captain , lieutenant @entity219 , for good luck after it stopped a bullet from entering his leg during the @entity225 in 1862			0
a concretion layer covers the the @entity10 submarine @entity9			1
the submarine was found several miles off @entity57 , @entity21 in the 1990s and was recovered in 2000 conservator @entity229 walks past the bow of the @entity10 submarine @entity9 as it stands free of the steel truss that was used to raise it from the ocean floor in 2000 after the truss was removed ' the submarine was a perfect time capsule of everything inside , ' said @entity238 , one of three maritime archaeologists on the project			1
the @entity241 is a partnership among the @entity21 @entity243 , @entity244 , the @entity245 and the nonprofit friends of the @entity9			1
the nonprofit group raised and spent $ 22 million on the project through 2010 , said a spokeswoman			0
the next phase of the project will be to remove corrosion on the iron hull and reveal the submarine 's skin , preserve it with chemicals , and eventually display it in open air , @entity80 said			2
scientists have found the vessel to be a more sophisticated feat of engineering than historians had thought , said @entity263 , director of @entity13 's @entity12			0
' it has the ballast tanks fore and aft , the dive planes were counterbalanced , the propeller was shrouded , ' @entity263 said			0
' it 's just got all of the elements that the modern submarines have , updated			0
' there were previous submarines , @entity263 said , but the @entity9 , designed to sail in the open ocean and built for warfare , was cutting - edge technology at the time			1
' @entity219 's mission was to attack and sink an enemy ship and he did , ' @entity263 said			1
' at that particular time , the mindset of naval warfare was , basically , big ships sink little ships			0
little ships do not sink big ships			0
and the @entity9 turned that upside down			2

@entity9 was the first submarine ever to sink an enemy warship in combat - in 1864
*researchers* will release their findings today - hopefully solving the mystery of why the boat never returned to port
