’ in an apparent attack on the last @entity39 government he went on : ‘ we went through a long period in @entity3 of having kind of multi-culti balkanisation of our society and we thought it was a very good idea to teach kids in their own language in primary school classes in @entity7			1
‘ i think that ’s a disastrous approach , they should be in @entity5			1
‘ as far as the mayoralty is concerned , we have dropped a lot of those ‘ we ’ll offer to translate our document into umpteen languages ’			0
i think its complete nonsense			0

‘ we whacked some dosh back in from city hall because i think it ’s an absolute priority			0
’ he said that in many parts of the capital whole communities do not speak @entity5			2
‘ you go out into @entity68 , places like that , you can find people who have been then there several generations who still do n’t speak @entity5			1
‘ one of the reasons is the media is so massive now but so disparate , so diffuse , that people can be tuned to their own communities and not fell the need to learn the common language of this city , of this country			1
‘ i think that is a great , great shame , it ’s a huge wasted opportunity for them			0
‘ i think everybody in this country , particularly people working in our public services , should speak @entity5			2
’ @entity0 insisted learning @entity5 was easy			1
he told @entity32 : ' it is not a difficult language			0

' @entity5 is unbelievably easy to get the hang of			2
look at the way i can string these sentences together with barely a verb ... ' his remarks come after @entity107 leader @entity106 suggested doctors who can not speak ' very good @entity5 ' should be banned from practising in the @entity3			1
the @entity107 leader said it was ' scandalous ' that not enough doctors and nurses were being trained in @entity3 , meaning thousands are brought in from overseas			0
however , he appeared unaware that two years ago the @entity114 announced new checks to be carried out on the language skills of medical staff			0
all @entity119 doctors have to pass a language test			0
mr @entity0 added : ‘ i ’m amazed by reports that people can not make themselves understood in @entity5 in this country to people working in the @entity119			2

‘ this is a country where @entity5 has been spoken for many centuries			0
‘ i do n’t want to be hostile towards speakers of other languages , other languages are beautiful things , but this is a country that happens to speak @entity5 and the way to participate in the @entity7 economy , to make a success of your life , my message to everybody whose @entity5 is a bit rusty , is go out , find a course for @entity5 speakers of another language , they are available			1
