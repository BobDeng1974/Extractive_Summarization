by @entity0 you may think that people living 100 years ago in cities of smog and steam - powered machinery could scarcely imagine our modern world today			2
and yet old postcards drawn by artists reveal scarily accurate predictions of 21st century gadgets from the vacuum cleaner and @entity13 , to large submarines			1
the intriguing colour sketches , called @entity16 2000 ( in the year 2000 ) , look strangely familiar despite being created between 1899 and 1910			1
the future is calling : over 100 years ago , @entity19 artists drawing scenes for cigar boxes dreamed up futuristic gadgets such as this cine - phono - telegraph , which allows people to speak over the telephone and see each other on a screen at the same time - much like @entity28 and @entity29 's @entity13 the quirky cards show a host of recognisable scenes including one picture , called @entity34 , which depicts a man relaxing in a chair while he makes a video phone call - akin to @entity28 or @entity29 's @entity13 , which people rely on today			1
the mechanical forerunner to the @entity40 – an automated orchestra - is included in the scenes , as well as a futuristic dictation machine designed to allow important businessmen to dictate notes and letters without the need for a secretary			1
face to face : the old postcards drawn by artists over 100 years ago reveal scarily accurate predictions of 21st century gadgets - including video phone calls , such as @entity13 ( pictured ) skating on thin ice ? the @entity19 artists envisioned a snowmobile which would allow people to explore @entity58 and see the penguins ( pictured )			1
today , numerous vehicles can traverse the hostile icy terrain and holidays are even offered for tourists to see the wildlife and vast icebergs music to our ears : the mechanical forerunner to the @entity40 - an automated orchestra , is pictured			2
automatons and music boxes were popular in the 19th century , but a system to provide enough volume for a theatre ( pictured ) was a dream meals on wheels : as soon as the weather is warm enough , a stream of rvs and caravans can be found trundling down to the seaside and scenic spots			0
but this was a novel idea 100 years ago and the artists imagined a literal mobile home , complete with a chimney , fine dining on a balcony and a mobile garden another image , entitled a bord d’un @entity95 sous - marin , shows a couple observing marine life through a giant window which bears more than a slight resemblance to the aquariums we have today – or perhaps the underwater observatory which is currently home to @entity104 who is living underwater for a month			0
dreaming of another age of exploration , the artists also penned scenes of people living in a submarine , travelling from @entity112 to @entity113 by train and using a snowmobile to see the penguins of the @entity117			2
all at sea : shipwrecks and accidents still happen today , but the artists envisioned a specially - equipped flying machine that could reach sailors in peril in even the worst weather conditions ( pictured ) a high flier : today , search and rescue helicopters patrol remote coastlines and can swoop down and hover close to the water 's surface to rescue marooned sailors , as well as people stuck on rocky headland ( pictured ) back to the future : this postcard shows a couple waterskiing - or even using skis that work a little like @entity138 's hover boards			1
interestingly , while the leisure equipment is futuristic , the people are still wearing traditional clothing of the 19th century @entity142 ! scientists are still working on creating technology that flies like the hover board seen in @entity146 ( pictured ) and they can now levitate and tiny particles take this down : no important businessman or industrialist would be without his own mechanical @entity151 in the year 2,000 , according to the artists			1
here , a high flier talks to a machine to record his thoughts instead of using a secretary - a process we have been familiar with for several decades another drawing , entitled @entity160 cloches a @entity161 , shows a couple water - skiing in an image , which would n’t look entirely out of place today if it was n’t for the vintage clothing			1
they even resemble the hoverboards from the film @entity138			0
in a different scene , called @entity169 , a happy maid watches as an electronically - powered broom sweeps the floor in a historic vision of the vacuum cleaner			0
life aquatic : this image , entitled a bord d'un @entity95 sous - marin , shows a couple observing marine life through a giant window , which bears more than a slight resemblance to the aquariums we have today , or even underwater laboratories used for studying marine animals getting their skates on : this image , entitled @entity189 a @entity190 , is a vision of futuristic powered roller skating , where each skate has a motor attached			0
the artist who drew the scene even foresaw accidents - as seen when wearing similar gadgets that exist today wheely great : they may not look like the powered roller skates in the 19th century picture , but these modern skates let people glide along with no effort at all as they are battery powered how illuminating : this scene , @entity207 , shows a futuristic exploration of the underwater world by means of a submarine shining beams of light in the darkness			2
today , navies around the world use submarines that can stay under water for months and personal vessels allow individuals to explore the sea floor sketches of gadgets designed to make womens ’ lives easier , also include a kitchen full of machines , some of which we take for granted			2
for example , most modern kitchens have ovens , blenders and drinks makers , and soon we could be doing our grocery shopping directly from a smart fridge or using a smart cooker			0
the postcards were originally published in @entity19 and distributed inside cigar boxes			1
interestingly , while the artists dreamed up whimsical machines , there were more conservative when it came to people 's clothes , as the figures in the drawings are dressed in their 19th century finest			1
the dream clean machine : this postcard shows a happy maid watching as an electronically powered broom sweep the floor			0
it would appear that the artists predicted the invention of the modern vacuum cleaner - although did not foresee that most families would be cleaning their houses themselves all abroad for the year 2,000 : dreaming of an age of exploration , the artists penned scenes of people living in a submarine and travelling from @entity112 to @entity113 by train ( pictured )			1
the engine has a nose that resembles a fighter jet full steam ahead : the 19th century may be regarded by some as the golden age of rail travel , when steam engines meant that more people could travel longer distances more comfortably			0
but today , trains can cross continents and @entity278 offers a journey from @entity112 to @entity113 ( formerly known as @entity113 )			0
we are even working on concepts like @entity282 which could travel at 760 mph ( 1,220 km / h ) voila ! artists seem to have predicted the voicemail			0
a missive phonographique - or futuristic recorded message , is brought on a tray by a servant ( pictured )			0
today the service comes neatly built in to most phones they were created by a variety of artists including @entity294 , and were designed to show visions of the world 100 years into the future			0
at least 87 different cards were produced with sets being printed in 1899 , 1900 and finally in 1910			0
this is the news : in the future , @entity19 artists imagined that people could listen to the newspaper - much like a radio news bulletin			1
they did not predict the television or @entity307 though for keeping people up to date with what 's going on in the world floating like a butterfly : @entity312 - a futuristic hydroplane , can be seen skimming along the surface of the sea			2
today , we still use this method of transportation and it has been adapted for land too a kitchen fit for @entity321 ? the @entity19 artists imagined a world where people did less of the chores themselves and kitchen were packed with gadgets			1
most modern kitchens have ovens and drinks makers ( pictured ) and soon we could be doing our grocery shopping directly from a smart fridge the appliance of science : our kitchens are getting smarter all the time with ovens ( pictured ) able to be turned on using phone apps , or able to offer recipes , while fridges can use @entity341 connections to order groceries			0

sketches called @entity16 2000 were drawn between 1899 and 1910 in @entity19
artists predicted 21st century gadgets such as the @entity40 and ski mobiles
while the gadgets are futuristic , people 's clothing in the scenes remained traditional - and women wear dresses while water - skiing
postcards were originally published in @entity19 and included in cigar boxes
