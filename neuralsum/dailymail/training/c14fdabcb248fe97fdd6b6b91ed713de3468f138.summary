@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 are each trying to lure new customers with futuristic technologies such as fingerprint scanners , 3d graphics and eyeball - tracking technology			1
however , a recent poll has revealed the majority of smartphone owners simply want a phone that ’s easy to use and has a long battery life			1
in fact , almost three quarters said they refuse to be swayed by gimmicks and novelty features			0
the poll was conducted by @entity18 - based @entity17			2
long battery life ( stock image pictured ) was listed as the top reason for buying a phone among 89 % of respondents , with a waterproof case being the second most popular feature among 67 % of people who took part in the study the poll was carried out by @entity18 - based @entity17 using an online survey of more than 1,605 mobile customers on pay - monthly contracts			1
long battery life would make 89 per cent of respondents more likely to buy a smartphone , while a waterproof body ( 67 per cent ) and a zoom camera lens ( 66 per cent ) were in second and third place			1
three quarters ( 75 per cent ) said eyeball - tracking technology - as seen on the @entity38 - would make no difference to their purchasing decision , while 69 per cent said they would n’t be lured by a phone with a voice control function , like @entity0 ’s @entity43 or @entity1 ’s @entity44			1
more than six in 10 said 3d graphics , as shown off at the @entity47 launch of @entity2 ’s @entity48 , would n’t make them any more or less likely to buy a handset , either			2
three quarters ( 75 per cent ) said eyeball - tracking technology - as seen on the @entity38 ( pictured ) - would make no difference to their purchasing decision , while 69 per cent said they would n’t be lured by a phone with a voice control function , like @entity0 ’s @entity43 or @entity1 ’s @entity44 more than six in 10 said 3d graphics , as shown off by @entity2 chief executive @entity55 ( pictured ) at the @entity47 launch of @entity2 ’s @entity48 , would n’t make them any more or less likely to buy a handset , either of those who already have these features , almost two thirds ( 66 per cent ) admitted to never using eyeball tracking , and more than half ( 55 per cent ) never use voice control			1
interestingly , almost a third ( 32 per cent ) who have fingerprint - scanning security have never used it			0
almost one in eight of the respondents said they do n’t own a smartphone , but have a feature phone instead			2
of these people , nearly half said they simply do n’t feel they need a smartphone , while 28 per cent are put off by the cost			0
@entity73 , telecoms expert at @entity74 , said : ‘ it ’s becoming increasingly hard for smartphone makers to differentiate their handsets from those of their rivals			0
' they hope that flash features like @entity82 on the @entity83 , or @entity2 ’s @entity48 and its ‘ @entity85 ’ display , will give their phones the edge			0
of those who already have these features , almost two thirds ( 66 per cent ) admitted to never using eyeball tracking , and more than half ( 55 per cent ) never use voice control			2
almost a third ( 32 per cent ) who have fingerprint - scanning security ( as seen on the @entity83 pictured ) have never used it ‘ however , our research shows that many can spot a gimmick from a mile away			0
it ’s actually the basics that affect the everyday user experience - like long battery life and a robust design - that people really care about			1
’ ‘ that being said , it does n’t take long for science fiction to become science fact in the mobile world , and features that we considered to be gimmicks just a couple of years ago like touchscreens and front - facing cameras are now integral to our daily smartphone experience			0
‘ so whilst great handsets are available that do the job , sometimes a bit of futuristic phone tech is just what ’s needed to move the industry forward			0
