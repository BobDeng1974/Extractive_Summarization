@entity0 suffered a fresh blow today after a poll of key marginal seats revealed voters were deserting @entity5 in droves and returning to @entity7 and the @entity8			1
in 10 battleground constituencies polled by the @entity12 peer @entity13 , @entity5 's vote has fallen in nine			1
support for mr @entity0 's party has more than halved in two seats and by more than a third in most of the others			1
the @entity5 leader has seen his support in @entity31 collapse from a 12 point lead over the @entity8			1
he is now sitting in second place in the @entity27 constituency , 1 per cent below his @entity12 rival @entity36 and only just ahead of @entity7			0
today 's polling also mirrors nationwide polls which show that @entity5 's support has fallen by 25 per cent in the last six months alone			1
in november last year 18 per cent of voters said they were planning to vote for @entity5 – but this has since fallen to less than 12.5 per cent , with polling experts now predicting that it could drop below 10 per cent by next month			2
@entity5 's dramatic collapse in support has not , however , led to a surge in support for the @entity8			1
according to lord @entity13 's poll of 10 marginal constituencies today , the @entity8 are set to lose four seats to @entity7 but cling on in five			1
a tenth seat is too close to call between the two main @entity53 parties			0
the four seats @entity7 are set to gain according to lord @entity13 are @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 & @entity58 and @entity59			0
according to lord @entity13 's poll of 10 marginal constituencies today , the @entity8 are set to lose four seats to labour but cling on to at least five the results suggest @entity7 has strengthened its position since lord @entity13 polled the same constituencies last year , when the party was only picking up three seats from the @entity8			1
the one seat which switched since last time is @entity55 in @entity68 where a small @entity12 lead has turned a four - point advantage for @entity7			0
but if the @entity71 was held tomorrow , the @entity8 would hold on to five of the 10 marginal seats it won in 2010 – @entity74 , @entity75 & @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
comic @entity80 , also known as the @entity81 , arrived at @entity83 offices in @entity84 , @entity27 , today to hand in his nomination papers as he stands in the @entity31 seat against @entity5 leader @entity0 with the race in @entity31 going down to the wire , any votes the comic takes from the main candidates could prove costly lord @entity13 has one constituency – @entity94 – where @entity7 and the @entity8 are tied			1
but the real shift in the seats , according to the @entity12 peer 's polling , is the huge squeeze on @entity5 's vote			1
lord @entity13 said : ' the most notable movement across the board in this round of polling was a move towards the two main parties at the expense of @entity5			2
' in this group of ten seats , the @entity5 share had fallen significantly – by up to ten points – in nine of the ten seats polled			2
' in only one seat did i find the lead had switched between parties – @entity55 , where a three - point @entity12 lead in december had become a four - point lead for @entity7			0
' the star of @entity5 's latest election poster has admitted he is not sure he is even going to vote for the party			1
@entity123 , 59 , features on @entity0 's party 's new poster highlighting the impact of @entity128 laws on coastal communities			1
the poster , which was launched by the @entity5 leader in @entity132 , reads : ' gutted			2
@entity134 's business has been ripped apart by the @entity128			0
' @entity0 unveiled @entity5 's latest campaign poster in support of the fishing industry during campaigning in @entity132 today the party has vowed to ' reclaim our territorial fishing waters , restore our fishing fleet and introduce sustainable fishing practices ' , as well as withdrawing from the @entity143			1
mr @entity123 , who started working full - time in the industry aged 15 , is managing director of @entity146 in @entity147 , north @entity148			0
his business has been badly hit and the quota , which has been blamed for bringing the industry in north @entity148 to the brink of collapse when skate and ray fishing was halted in october			0
he praised the work of both @entity12 and @entity5 politicians locally in @entity148 but said he had not decided who he would support on may 7 - wishing he had two votes			2
mr @entity123 , a third generation fisherman , said : ' what has been done to @entity162 waters is totally disgusting with the amount of fish that is taken by @entity165			0
' mr @entity123 insisted he was supportive of any politician who campaigned to ' get our waters back ' - blaming the @entity128 for the decline of his industry in the @entity162			0
he said : ' it 's not political			0
i 'd support any mp who agrees that we should have our @entity162 waters back under our own control			0
' mr @entity123 said he had not met mr @entity0 but praised him as a ' normal working man ' , who likes a drink and a smoke			2
but he praised the work of conservative candidate @entity181 , who is standing for re-election in @entity183 and @entity184			0
he said : ' the local people for @entity5 and the @entity12 have done so much for the fishing industry			2
it 's a pity i do n't have two votes			0
it will be a very tough choice			0
