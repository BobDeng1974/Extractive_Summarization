new advert for organic @entity2 cream has been met with criticism shows a leather - clad 52 - year - old smashing up pensioner 's belongings tv presenter and make - up artist @entity6 has swapped light - hearted beauty shows for a role as a femme fatale in a gangster - style promotional clip ... and she 's coming under fire from the grey rinse brigade			1
the blonde beauty guru is the star of director @entity17 's new advert for organic @entity2 cream which pokes fun at the elderly and has been blasted on social networking sites for its inappropriate references to old age			1
the video , which promotes @entity2 alternative cream @entity24 , shows @entity6 - who has made a career out of staying glamourous while women the same age as her let it all go - smashing a pair of pensioner 's reading glasses with her heeled boots			1
she then fires a gun at false teeth before throwing a mobility scooter from a building and setting fire to a shopping trolley and bus pass			0
@entity6 certainly looks the part in her thigh - high black leather boots , gold leather jacket and bright red lipstick , but the wife of @entity71 singer @entity70 has been criticised for her role , despite being 52 - years - old herself and admitting to using the cream as well as @entity2 in the past			1
one posted on @entity75 : ' it ’s no laughing matter , fact ! how is this fun or a laugh ? if you have to push your terminally - ill mother round in a wheelchair , you might understand ! ads like this should be banned , fact ! ' however , one @entity85 user rushed to support the presenter saying : ' look how utterly amazing @ @entity87 looks in her new advert for @entity64 ! it might be controversial , but she looks gorgeous ! ' defending herself @entity6 told @entity92 : ' i look good for my age , i have looked after myself and now i do n't even use @entity2 as i use the cream instead			1
up yours : the presenter can be seen smashing up a pair of glasses and throwing a mobility scooter from a building hell for leather : @entity6 is glamorously decked out in leather but has been met with much criticism ' i love having a frown free face			2
why should i worry about what people think of my age so no more fibbing about it ! ' there has been quite a lot of people getting angry about the advert but no harm was meant ; i mean come on , i 'll have my real bus pass soon ! ' on @entity64 's website , the £ 89.99 product is described as an alternative to @entity2			2
it says : ' this natural @entity2 alternative still works in much the same way as traditional @entity2			2
however , its application does not require the use of needles to inject a toxic component into the body			0
' it gives the effect of @entity2 by stimulating the muscles and nerves to clear the effect of lines and wrinkles and prevent them from re-appearing			0
' it contains microscopic electromagnetically charged particles to stimulate and relax nerves and muscles			0
' there is less chance of encountering problems when using the product as it is produced with completely natural ingredients			0
' speaking about the product @entity6 said : ' i immediately saw a difference in the deep horizontal lines in my forehead , my skin is so tight and vibrant , ' i just ca n’t get enough of this stuff ! ' a film by @entity150			0
