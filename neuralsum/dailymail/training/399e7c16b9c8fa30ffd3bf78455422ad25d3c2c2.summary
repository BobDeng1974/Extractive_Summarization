by @entity0 a study predicts net migration from inside @entity3 will be 130,000 every year if current trends continue			1
pictured , @entity6 passengers aboard a bus , leaving @entity8 , to take them to the @entity9 in january immigration from the @entity12 will add the equivalent of a city as big as @entity15 to the @entity9 ’s population every four years , a report warns today			1
the study predicts net migration from inside @entity3 will be 130,000 every year if current trends continue			1
this total includes 50,000 @entity6 and @entity19 and 40,000 from @entity20 and the seven other @entity22 nations which joined the @entity12 in 2004			1
on january 1 , @entity9 lifted all restrictions on @entity6 and @entity19 working in the @entity9			1
no figures are yet available for how many have arrived since that date			0
however , in the year to september 2013 there were 24,000 arrivals and around 140,000 were already working in the @entity9 at the start of the year			0
the remainder of the predicted migrants are expected to come from the so - called ‘ old ’ @entity12 – including large numbers from @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 fleeing the eurozone disaster			2
experts say that within years @entity12 immigration could overtake that from the rest of the world as the main source of arrivals to @entity9			1
@entity43 compiled the figures from official government sources			0
the campaign group said one of the major pull factors to the @entity9 was the generous system of in - work benefits , such as tax credits			0
a migrant with no dependants earning the minimum wage has their net income of around £ 184 a week boosted to £ 254 by tax credits and housing benefit			0
in effect , @entity59 support makes up 28 per cent of their final take - home pay of £ 13,218 a year			0
immigration from the @entity12 will add the equivalent of a city as big as @entity15 ( pictured ) to the @entity9 ¿ s population every four years if the migrant has a partner and two children , the net weekly income rockets from £ 184 to £ 543			1
state handouts constitute 66 per cent of a total annual income of £ 28,241			0
@entity43 said ministers should consider denying migrants access to in - work benefits and tax credits for the first five years they are here			0
under the current regime , a single worker on the minimum wage in the @entity9 would be able to earn four - and - a - half times the income they could earn in @entity6 – or nine times as much for a family			2
any attempt to treat @entity12 migrants differently to @entity9 citizens , who receive the same level of tax credits and other benefits , would spark a huge row with @entity91			2
the @entity92 is already dragging @entity93 to court over the so - called ‘ right to reside ’ test			0
but the @entity9 may hope to secure an ally in @entity98 , which last week signalled its own intention to take a tougher line on @entity12 immigration			1
@entity43 said ministers should consider denying migrants access to in - work benefits and tax credits for the first five years they are here last night , sir @entity106 , chairman of @entity43 , said : ‘ the good news is that immigration from outside the @entity12 is coming down steadily as the government has promised			2
the bad news is that migrants from the @entity12 have driven the policy off course			2
‘ it was crazy to have opened up our labour market and our benefit system to 100million people from countries with a standard of living less than a quarter of our own			0
‘ there must now be a determined renegotiation			0
’ to date , @entity109 efforts to control @entity12 immigration have focused on access to out - of - work benefits , such as @entity125			1
but the @entity43 study points out that migrants from the @entity12 have one of the highest employment rates of all groups in the @entity9			2
some 79 per cent of @entity22 migrants – known as @entity132 or @entity133 workers – are in employment , compared to 71 per cent of the @entity9 population as a whole			2
however , the report states : ‘ this should not be used as an indication of the extent to which they are actually able to maintain themselves and their families in the @entity9			0
‘ @entity132 migrants have on average lower wages , many are employed at no more than minimum wage and many declare themselves self - employed with little evidence of income at even minimum - wage levels			0
‘ at this level , both employees and self - employed are heavily subsidised by the taxpayer through in - work benefits and tax credits			0
’ earlier this year , the @entity157 were dealt a huge blow by figures showing total net migration – the difference between the number of people arriving in the @entity9 and those leaving – had rocketed by 60,000 to 212,000 in the year to september 2013			1
it was driven entirely by a 40 per cent leap in the number of people taking advantage of @entity12 edicts on free @entity170 shock increase left @entity171 unable to say if @entity172 would meet his key election promise to slash net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ by 2015			1
@entity43 said that , based on current trends , @entity177 net migration could fall to just 100,000 and be taken over by arrivals from the @entity12 as the main source of net migration			1
immigration minister @entity182 said : ‘ our reforms have cut @entity177 migration to its lowest level since 1998 and there are now 82,000 fewer people arriving annually from outside the @entity12 than when this government came to power			1
‘ we are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between @entity12 member states and ensuring that controls on benefits and services , including the @entity196 and social housing , are among the tightest in @entity3			1
‘ but as long as there are huge economic disparities in the @entity12 , there will be an overwhelming incentive for people to move			2
‘ in future , we must slow full access to labour markets until we can be sure it will not lead to mass migration – for example , by requiring new member states to reach a certain level of income or economic output per head before full free movement is allowed			0

net migration from inside @entity3 will hit ' 130,000 every year '
the figure includes *90,000* @entity6 , @entity19 , @entity20 and other @entity22 nations
@entity12 immigration could overtake that from the rest of the world
