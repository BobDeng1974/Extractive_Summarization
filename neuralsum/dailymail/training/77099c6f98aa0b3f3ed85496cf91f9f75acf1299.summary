for most people , solving a @entity1 ’s cube is hard enough - many houses have one of the unsolved puzzles stored away in a cupboard somewhere , away from frustrated eyes			2
so if you fall into that group , look away now - because one company has made a giant version of the popular toy			2
with more than 18 times more squares than the regular toy , the latest gadget promises to confound a whole new generation this @entity17			1
@entity19 - based @entity18 has released a larger version of a @entity21 ( shown )			1
each of its six sides have a huge 169 coloured tiles - 1,014 in total called the @entity27 , the cube is formed from 13 squares in a row on each side of the cube			1
in total the 3d puzzle features 1,014 coloured tiles that have to be matched up in order to complete the buzzle			2
that means each side has a rather daunting 169 coloured tiles , compared to just the nine found on a regular @entity21			1
its makers , @entity19 - based @entity18 , claim it is ‘ good for creative thinking and improving both your iq and @entity45 [ emotional intelligence ] ’			1
however , anyone wanting to try and solve the puzzle might be put off by the price - a whopping £ 205 ( $ 320 ) - which is almost as head scratching as the toy itself			1
@entity18 says the toy has a quality design and is made to handle smoothly			2
it is also apparently good for training both your left and right brain , according to the company			0
however , with regards to any hints to solving it , @entity18 only suggests taking a ‘ tea break ’ and retrying it			0
the @entity27 has more than 18 times more squares than the regular toy - which has 54			1
it is also slightly curved on each side			2
but the price is equally challenging - at a whopping £ 205 ( $ 320 ) @entity18 , claim the toy is ‘ good for creative thinking and improving both your iq and @entity45 [ emotional intelligence ]			1
' but to solve it all they recommend is a ' tea break ' and to try again the original @entity21 ( shown ) was invented by @entity78 architect @entity1 in 1974 - but compared to the latest version , it has just a paltry 54 coloured tiles single time : @entity81 of the @entity82 in march 2013 with a time of 5.55 seconds at the @entity84 in @entity85			1
average time : @entity86 at the @entity87 2013 with a 6.54 seconds average solve time			0
one - handed solving : a time of 9.03 seconds was made by @entity86 at the @entity90 feet solving : @entity92 solved a @entity21 with his feet in 27.93 seconds at the @entity94 2012			0
robot : @entity96 3 solved a @entity21 in 3.253 seconds - beating the @entity96 2 's record of 5.27 seconds			0
a few days ago , @entity98 produced a moment for fans of the original @entity21 to savour - when he solved the puzzle blindfolded in just 21.17 seconds - a new world record			0
the speed cuber took a few seconds to memorise the pattern on the @entity21 and then , while blindfolded , he needed just a few more to solve it during a competition in @entity107 in western @entity108			0
a judge held a piece of paper between @entity98 's face and his hands to make sure he could n't peek under his mask			0
his celebration was subdued , however , as he jumped out of his chair and remained quiet out of respect for other competitors who were still trying to solve the puzzle			0
quite how he ’d cope with the 13 - cubed @entity21 while blindfolded remains to be seen - or rather not seen .			0
