@entity0 ( pictured in 2006 ) , a @entity1 - winning poet whose intimate portraits of blue - collar life were grounded in personal experience and political conscience , died at his @entity7 home on saturday at age 87			1
while he taught in several colleges , @entity0 had little in common with the academic poets of his time , as he was not abstract , insular or digressive			1
@entity0 captured the ways ' ordinary people are extraordinary , ' while writing poems that are accessible to readers , said @entity34 , a friend of @entity0 and president of the @entity36			2
' they move between the most ordinary diction and high romantic heights			2
' he added : ' we 've lost a great presence in @entity11 poetry			2
' born in @entity44 in 1928 and the son of @entity48 @entity47 immigrants , @entity0 was profoundly shaped by his working - class childhood and years spent working in jobs ranging from driving a truck to assembling parts at a @entity54 plant			1
as a poet , he consciously modeled himself after @entity56 , as he strove to be a writer of everyday experience and cosmic wonder			2
this was evident in his tactile , conversational poems that focused on his childhood , living in @entity63 , marriage , parenting and poetry itself			0
@entity0 was also a lover of the earth and sky as much as any poet of nature , but his poems explored the pangs of work and workers , such as @entity76 or saturday sweeping , in which employees toil under a leaky roof and ' blue hesitant light			1
' in @entity19 , the title piece of his celebrated 1991 collection , he offers a grim sketch of standing on line in the rain , hoping for a job : this is about waiting , shifting from one foot to another			0
feeling the light rain falling like mist into your hair , blurring your vision until you think you see your own brother ahead of you , maybe ten places			0
the former poet laureate from 2011 to 2012 passed away from pancreatic and liver cancer , his wife said sunday			1
he was among the country 's most decorated poets , winning the @entity1 in 1995 for the simple truth and @entity17 for the 1979 collection ashes and for what work is @entity0 's father , who was an auto - parts salesman , died when he was five years old			1
and although his mother found work as an office manager , he remembered his childhood as ' a succession of moves from first a house to a series of ever - shrinking apartments			2
' as a kid , he was scrawny and imagined himself in peril on the streets of @entity44 , ' the most anti-semitic city west of @entity121			0
' he would picture himself walking home from school with a rifle , shooting at @entity125 , @entity126 and other cars owned by rich people			2
by the end 1942 , when he was 14 , and had worked at a soap factory and , like a first kiss , he discovered poetry			0
@entity0 became fond of it while attending @entity44 's @entity134 in 1945 , after a teacher let him borrow a book by poet @entity137 , according to the @entity138			1
he would walk the streets late at night , speaking to the ' moon and stars about the emotional revolution that was raging ' inside him			0
@entity0 later attended @entity143 , where he read the verse of @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 , and ' immersed ' himself in the history of poetry			2
' i believed even then that if i could transform my experience into poetry i would give it the value and dignity it did not begin to possess on its own , ' he later observed			0
the exhausting factory hours made @entity0 so determined to write that he showed up in 1953 at the @entity160 's @entity159 even though a planned fellowship had fallen through			1
he was told he could sign up for one course , but he enrolled in three , and poet @entity163 became his mentor			0
' he seemed to feel i had something genuine , ' @entity0 told the @entity166 in 1988 , ' but that i was n't doing enough with it , was n't demanding enough from my work			2
he kept directing me to poetry that would raise my standards			0
' as a poet , he ( pictured in 1999 ) consciously modeled himself after @entity56 , as he strove to be a writer of everyday experience and cosmic wonder			0
this was evident in his tactile , conversational poems that focused on his childhood , living in @entity63 , marriage , parenting and poetry itself @entity0 's other honors included the @entity21 for lifetime achievement ( above @entity0 pictured in 1987 after receiving the prize ) and a @entity23 poet @entity185 allowed @entity0 to stay with him at his home in @entity7 and also selected him for a @entity188 in 1958			1
around the same time , @entity0 joined the faculty of @entity7 in @entity6 and remained there for more than 30 years			1
he also taught at @entity190 and @entity191 among other colleges			0

he wrote poems about @entity63 and helped translate works by the @entity63 poets @entity219 and @entity220			2
when he was back in the @entity11 , @entity0 was an opponent of the @entity221 and defender of civil rights and the rights of working people			2
in @entity226 , @entity44 1968 , he took in ' the charred faces ' and ' eyes boarded up ' of his hometown , which had been devastated by riots the year before			0
in 1968 , he also was among the writers who vowed not to pay taxes until the @entity221 ended			0
' i can remember feeling full of the power of a just cause and believing that power would not fail me			0
it failed me or i failed it			0
we did n't really change the way @entity11 lived , unless you take hairstyles seriously , ' he once said			0
' i 'm not a man of action ; it finally comes down to that			0
i 'm not so profoundly moral that i can often overcome my fears of prison or torture or exile or poverty			0
i 'm a contemplative person who goes in the corner and writes			0
