there are precious occasions in a manager ’s career when the football flows , the fans sing his name and the world is a wonderful place			0
the briefest glance at @entity11 ’s face told us that this had been such an evening			0
the cares and controversies of an arduous week had dissolved in a flood of goals			0
his team , skilfully constructed from a calamitous injury list , stylishly practised the football he preaches			0
and his mood was such that he even allowed himself a rare statement of his basic philosophy : ‘ my job is to win football matches , and make people happy ’ , he said @entity28 scored twice as @entity29 defeated @entity30 4 - 1 in the @entity31 on saturday evening @entity28 completed the scoreline from the penalty spot with a ' @entity35 ' penalty after @entity36 was fouled in the box @entity36 ( right ) was brought down inside the @entity30 penalty area by left back @entity39 in the dying moments of the match @entity28 watches on as his ingenious penalty floats into the goal as he celebrates his 30th birthday in style @entity28 ( centre right ) is congratulated on his second strike of the match by his @entity29 team - mates @entity29 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity49 6 ; @entity50 7 , @entity51 7 , @entity52 6.5 , @entity53 6.5 ; @entity54 6 ; @entity55 7.5 ( @entity56 87 , @entity57 ) , @entity58 7 ( @entity59 90 , @entity57 ) , @entity28 7.5 , @entity36 7 ; @entity60 8 ( @entity61 73 , @entity62 ) subs not used : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 goals : @entity60 15 and 58 , @entity69 and 88 booked : @entity50 , @entity58 manager : @entity11 7.5 @entity30 : @entity71 4.5 , @entity72 5 , @entity73 6 , @entity74 5.5 , @entity39 6 , @entity75 5 , @entity76 6.5 , @entity77 5 , @entity78 5 ( @entity79 82 ) , @entity80 4.5 ( @entity81 56 , @entity57 ) , @entity82 4 ( @entity83 56 , @entity57 )			1

manager : @entity91 5.5 referee : @entity93 ( @entity94 ) 5 @entity95 : @entity60 attendance : 59 , 949 @entity96 by @entity97 at the @entity98 click here for all the stats , goals - including @entity60 's second goal ( above ) - and heat maps from the @entity98 and it was then that we sensed how much he had been hurt by the furore which followed those doltish insults on @entity110 station last saturday evening			1
@entity11 does not reveal his private face so easily , he does not allow himself to appear vulnerable			0
but he actually deigned to speak of the @entity110 incident : ‘ 99.9 per cent of the people in this country treat me with respect			0
i can take the other 0.1 per cent			0
’ he even spoke in vague reproach of the way he has been treated : ‘ when you try to attack and you win , everyone says ‘ ‘ well done ’ ’			0
if you attack and do n’t win , they say you are not realistic			0
’ @entity60 ( centre top ) gave @entity29 the lead on 15 minutes with a towering header against @entity30 @entity60 ( far left ) watches on as his header sails into the top corner of the @entity30 net the @entity128 international wheels away in celebration at giving the @entity130 the lead in their @entity31 encounter @entity60 ( centre right ) is congratulated on his strike by his fellow @entity29 team - mates at the @entity98 midfielder @entity58 ( left ) tries to run past @entity30 full back @entity72 during their encounter @entity29 striker @entity36 ( centre ) came close to doubling their lead but his shot went narrowly wide past the post @entity28 ( left ) attempts to dribble past @entity30 midfielder @entity75 during saturday 's @entity31 match he was in genuinely expansive form			1
but then , so were his team			0
right from the start , @entity29 played enviably precise football at a dizzying pace			2
and with @entity30 total strangers to their recent impressive form , those who had doubted both @entity11 and his team became swept up in the thrill of it all			2
the movement was bewildering , the imagination dazzling			0
in @entity28 , greatly enjoying his 30th birthday , and the imperious @entity60 , they had players capable of setting the tone , dictating the terms			1
@entity29 performed like a team brimming with breezy confidence , and when @entity52 ’s header struck the inside of the @entity30 crossbar after eight minutes , their football was denied the lead it deserved			1
yet the opening goal was delayed only until the 15th minute and was the product of another sublime passing sequence , which culminated in @entity55 flighting a cross and @entity60 towering above @entity72 for his emphatic scoring header			1
@entity29 appeared to have fashioned a second a few moments later , when @entity36 scuffed a scoring shot beyond young @entity71			1
but @entity36 was deprived for an apparent clip on @entity72 , leaving @entity11 to fret and fume for the only time			1
when @entity29 are in this mood , they can be almost unplayable			2
yet they desperately sought a second goal to ease the nerves of their supporters , and it might have come most dramatically in 32 minutes when @entity55 hoisted an exquisite sand - iron of a chip into the six - yard box and @entity36 allowed it to fall over his shoulder before meeting it with a volley			1
it passed a foot beyond the far post , and it might have been one of the goals of the season			0
but @entity29 demonstrated why they needed the insulation of further goals , when a free - kick dropped inside their own box and @entity82 hit @entity49 from a handful of yards			1

@entity28 gave @entity29 a 2 - 0 lead in the 54th minute with a delicate left - footed chip over @entity30 goalkeeper @entity71 the diminutive @entity211 international watches on as his left - footed chip sails beautifully into the @entity30 goal @entity28 ( right ) hugs team - mate @entity55 who provided him the assist for his goal at the @entity98 @entity29 striker @entity60 ( left ) celebrates his second strike in their 4 - 1 @entity31 win against @entity30 on saturday @entity60 's second of the match came following a neat flick at the near post from a @entity50 cross @entity60 ( left ) watches on as his strike nestles into the roof of the @entity30 goal to give them a 3 - 0 lead on 58 minutes the 28 - year - old ( second left ) is mobbed by his team - mates as they celebrate his second strike against the @entity229 @entity30 were finally discovering their game , and the entertainment was totally absorbing			1
despite having been largely outplayed , @entity30 were still in the match			2
and their mood early in the second half added to the home misgivings			2
but the @entity29 goal on 54 minutes was both brilliant and soothing			1
@entity55 , taking up all the difficult , uncomfortable positions , touched a short pass inside the area			2
@entity28 , with a small miracle of balance and technique , looked up , found his feet , and chipped the chance into the wall of the net			2
four minutes later , it seemed over			0
@entity54 instigated the adventure with a probing ball from deep			0
a swarm of red - shirted attackers made themselves available , @entity50 played a precise cross from the right , and the excellent @entity60 appeared at the near post to devour the opportunity			1
but @entity29 always offer teams a chance , and this was no exception			2
on 63 minutes , @entity76 struck a free - kick from the left and @entity78 , quite unmolested , diverted the scoring header			1
@entity29 seemed destined to finish this one with nerves stretching			2
then , with six minutes remaining , a section of the @entity29 fans burst into a chant of ‘ there ’s only one @entity11 ’			2
it was clearly aimed at those who have been attacking the old chap of late , and the demonstration of loyalty produced one final flourish			0
@entity36 accelerated once more into the @entity30 area , and a bumping of bodies with defender @entity39 produced the inevitable penalty			1
@entity28 sauntered up and chipped nervelessly , @entity11 gave a small , approving nod and @entity29 were handsomely home			1
asked about the possibilities in tomorrow ’s @entity283 draw , he replied : ‘ maybe i will go to church at the weekend			0
’ at the end of such a week , a few words of thanks to the @entity287 might not go amiss			0
