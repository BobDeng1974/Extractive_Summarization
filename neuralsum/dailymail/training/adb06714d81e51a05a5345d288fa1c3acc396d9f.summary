researchers now say the daring 1962 @entity2 jail break that many have said over the decades likely ended in the deaths of the escapees may have had a happy ending for the three daring escapees			1
new computer models that consider the @entity10 's tides , winds and other factors reveal the prisoners stood a small chance of paddling to freedom on the north side of the @entity17			1
according to the @entity20 team of scientists that assembled the data , it all depends on the time inmates @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 set sail in their makeshift dingy made of raincoats			1
scroll down to see @entity29 the way they look today ? new computer models that consider the @entity10 's tides , winds and other factors reveal @entity25 and @entity24 and @entity26 stood a small chance of paddling to freedom from @entity2			1
here , prison mug shots of the trio are compared to images of how they might look today best case scenario : computer models assembled by a @entity20 team of researchers reveal the escapees had a chance to beat the odds if they launched their dingy of raincoats between 11pm and midnight and then paddled hard to the north ' only in the time window between ( 11pm ) and midnight do they get close enough to the shore to have a chance to survive , ' writes one of the researchers , dr. @entity55 , on his blog			1
otherwise , one of three disastrous things would have happened			2
had they launched in the hours before , the men would have been sucked out into the frigid @entity59 and died of hypothermia			1
had they waited until after midnight , the tide would have shifted during their daring voyage and the current would have pushed them deeper into the @entity10			1
there , they either would have perished from cold before they got close enough to the @entity68 to make landfall or gotten picked up by authorities when the sun rose in the morning			0
the @entity72 : for 20th century crime buffs , few capers match the intrigue and ingenuity of the " @entity78 , " the 1962 prison break three inmates pulled off with stolen spoons , dummy heads and a raincoat raft			0
the @entity20 team from @entity84 used this model of the currents in @entity10 on june 11 , 1962 worst case : if the escapees left too early or failed to paddle north after leaving the island , they would have gotten sucked into the @entity59 and died we know the third possibility never happened			1
out of the 36 @entity2 inmates who tried to flee before the prison was closed in march 1963 , the three are the only ones who remain unaccounted for , according to the @entity98 , which maintains active arrest warrants on @entity26 and the @entity100			1
assuming the men did launch sometime around 11:30 and somehow knew to first paddle their makeshift boat hard to the north -- towards @entity104 , where some of their belongings and a paddle would later be found -- they could have become the only prisoners to ever escape the so - called inescapable prison			1
' if they hit it exactly at midnight , the beautiful thing is that we see that they would have been sucked out towards the @entity17 , ' dr @entity55 told @entity115			1
shocking simplicity : the men used spoons to dig holes through their cell walls as they neared the bridge , the shifting tides would have made paddling far easier			1
' in the best case , the escapees peddle northwards with a speed of almost 1 km per hour , an almost olympian effort			0
in that scenario , they most likely survive and make it to the north side of the @entity17 , ' @entity55 wrote			0
whether or not that happened , we 're unlikely to ever know and the story 's sensational mystery remains			2
for 20th century crime buffs , few capers match the intrigue and ingenuity of the ' @entity78 , ' which the inmates pulled off with stolen spoons , dummy heads and a raincoat raft			0
the escapees fashioned these dummy heads using soap , paper and real hair that they placed on their beds to fool guards the @entity149 acquired most of what it learned about the great escape from a fourth inmate who planned to take part in the break out but , at the last minute , ran into technical problems			0
the four reportedly spent months using spoons and forks to dig holes in the crumbling masonry surrounding the air vents in their cells			0
the crawl spaces they fashioned eventually pierced the six - and - a - half - inch thick walls until they reached a utility corner , from which they were able to shimmy out through a roof vent			0
to prepare for their flights , they also produced a raft and life vests out of more than 50 cotton raincoats , with rubberized backing , that inmates were assigned			2
they also had created mannequin heads out of paper , paint and hair purloined from the prison barber shop			0
they left the heads in their beds while they worked on the raft and the night of the getaway			2
replicas of the dummy heads lie in their former cells , which are popular stops with the more than a million tourists who visit @entity2 every year			0
while what happened to the three men remains a mystery , the escape 's enduring mystique is n't ambiguous at all , @entity192 spokeswoman @entity191 said			2
' it 's one of those yarns where everyone can attach their own reality because they can wrap themselves around whatever part they want , ' @entity191 said			2
the holes led to an unused utility area			0
from there , they shimmied onto the roof through a vent in the ceiling			0

it all depends on the time @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 set sail in their makeshift dingy made of raincoats that june night
had they put in between 11pm and midnight -- and paddled hard -- a @entity20 team 's computer models reveal they would have made it *safely* to land
any other time and the daring trio would have wound up dead in the frigid @entity59 or somewhere in the @entity10
