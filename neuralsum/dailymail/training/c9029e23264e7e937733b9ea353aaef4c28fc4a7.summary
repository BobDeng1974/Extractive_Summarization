this september , the @entity1 show was one of the most talked about of @entity3			0
but @entity5 's new designs are n't the only thing to have got the clothes industry talking - the addition of 14 - year - old model @entity9 on the catwalk also raised several immaculately - plucked eyebrows			1
the decision to include the @entity15 teenager in the show has reignited the debate about how what age models need to be in order to take part in these events			2
models under the age of 16 are not allowed at @entity30 or @entity31 @entity5 has a long history of using young models in both her catwalks and campaigns - she is responsible for kick - starting the careers of several unknown teens after casting them in her projects			1
the actress @entity40 appeared in a @entity42 campaign aged just 14 back in 2011 , which was subsequently banned by the @entity43			0
@entity45 model @entity44 was photographed for another @entity42 campaign when she was just 15 , and @entity47 , @entity48 , and @entity49 were all 16 when they modeled for the @entity27 2011 aw adverts			1
but since those days , several rules have been implemented in the fashion industry to prevent young models being used			0
the @entity27 show is considered one of the biggest and most popular of @entity3 in 2011 , the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) put a ban on any models under the age of 16 appearing on the catwalk at @entity3 shows			1
the guidelines were taken so seriously that models showing up to walk the runways were often asked to bring @entity66 to prove they were of working age			0
according to the @entity70 , in @entity30 there are no specific rules for model ages at @entity3 , but all members of the @entity74 have agreed not to sign any of their models under 16 years old up for these catwalk shows			2
after the @entity27 show ( pictured ) @entity77 also walked in a second catwalk at @entity3 - the @entity80 show in an open letter to the fashion industry in 2011 , @entity57 president @entity81 summed up the argument for only using models over the age of 16 in catwalk shows			1
she said : ' the industry â€™s hiring of prepubescent - appearing teenage girls as models of adult clothing sets an unrealistic standard ; hips and breasts , the curves that define the female figure , are absent			2
' some models have difficulty maintaining the body ideal as they move into adulthood and run the risk of engaging in unhealthy eating behaviors that lead to eating disorders			0
' @entity106 has contacted @entity27 for a comment .			0

the age of @entity15 model @entity9 raised eyebrows at @entity27 catwalk show
guidelines ban models under 16 walking in @entity31 in @entity45
model agents at @entity119 also *promise* to use older teens
@entity122 believes hiring young teens sets unrealistic body standards
