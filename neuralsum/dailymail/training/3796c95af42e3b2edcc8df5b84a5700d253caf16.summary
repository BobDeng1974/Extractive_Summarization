@entity1 hero @entity0 thanked coach @entity2 for being the architect of the glorious goal that sank the @entity5 at @entity6			1
the @entity8 man savoured perhaps his finest moment in the dark blue of his country — and an unforgettable career highlight — when he curled home a brilliant shot from the fringe of the area with 15 minutes remaining			2
it was a sublime finishing touch to the nimblest of moves , with @entity0 and @entity20 working a short corner routine before skipper @entity22 set up his former @entity24 team - mate with a back - heel flick			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity0 ( left ) celebrates after scoring the winner for @entity1 against the @entity5 @entity1 coach @entity2 ( second left ) celebrates on the touchline after @entity0 's goal @entity0 revealed it was a routine plotted by former @entity32 manager @entity2 — @entity1 ’s third in command — during preparations at their @entity37 training base			1
but the 31 - year - old revealed it was very much a case of alright on the night after a series of botched attempts at the move in the build - up to the crunch @entity45 qualifier			1
‘ i was confident that we would score but maybe not in the way we did , ’ admitted @entity0			1
‘ it was a slight variation on what we worked on in training			2
the way @entity5 set up made us change it slightly			1
we worked on something similar this week and the coach has to take credit for this			1
‘ it was @entity2 , he worked on it			1
it came off slightly differently to what we had been planning			2
@entity2 and @entity61 work pretty hard on these set - pieces and they do n’t always come off			1
‘ it went in zero times in training ! these things you practise hundreds of times and you just kind of hope that they ( the opposition ) switch off and it happens in a match like it did tonight			2
‘ you get an initial reaction when connecting with the ball , but the difference between that going in and hitting the post is millimetres			2
you know you have a fair chance of scoring , but it was just pure elation at the time when it went in			2
‘ i ’ve been fortunate to score some special goals — but this is right up there and it meant the world to me and the team			2
it was a special moment to be part of			2
the @entity1 fans go wild as @entity0 's goal helps move them up to third in @entity45 qualifying @entity92 ‘ there was n’t much in the game and it was n’t overly pretty			1
we always felt there would be one moment either for us or @entity5 that would settle the game			1
’ on a bruising night at @entity6 , captain @entity22 insisted @entity1 had defied an @entity101 plan to knock them out of their stride — by fair means or foul			1
@entity107 ’s side thundered into challenges throughout the match , earning four bookings to the two picked up by @entity112 ’s side			0
@entity113 could well have seen red for clattering through goal hero @entity0 in the latter stages but @entity116 referee @entity115 allowed play to continue and did n’t return with a second yellow card for the @entity120 right - back			1
that kind of physical confrontation is meat - and - drink to toughened competitors such as @entity22 , but he expressed pride in the way the entire @entity128 team stood tall			1
‘ i think @entity5 ’s gameplan was to try and stop us playing football , ’ said @entity22			1
‘ but it did n’t work			0
‘ we still managed to get the ball down in tight situations and play , knock nice little one - twos and create chances for ourselves			2
@entity0 curls a low strike across goal and into the far bottom corner to clinch victory for the hosts ‘ were @entity5 lucky to finish with 11 men ? i do n’t know			1
there were a few rough tackles but i did n’t get a good eye on them			0
‘ overall , it was a good night			0
it was n’t the best performance in the world but we got the victory			0
‘ i think @entity5 came up with a plan where they tried to play from back to front			1
they tried to impose their own gameplan but we kept trying to get the ball down and trying to play			0
‘ did we deserve to win ? yeah			0
i think we were the better team from start to finish			0
we tried to play football and i think that is what the fans keep coming along to see			0
’ the @entity1 camp had protested pre-match that last night ’s encounter was not a ‘ must - win ’ occasion , but @entity22 did not attempt to downplay the importance of the result			1
@entity166 ’s rout of @entity167 merely increased the need for victory , with @entity112 ’s side now sitting alongside @entity171 and world champions @entity173 on seven points after four games			0
@entity176 visit @entity6 for a high - profile friendly on tuesday evening before @entity178 come to @entity179 on @entity45 business in march			1
the return match with @entity107 ’s men is in @entity183 in june			0
‘ it is shaping up to be a great group and there is still an awful lot to do , ’ said @entity22			0
the ball curls into the net as the @entity5 defenders can only look on ‘ we just want to keep things going when the qualifiers start again			1
‘ this has been a great result in front of 60,000 people at @entity6			0
it is huge for us			0
‘ we have got a winning mentality and we want to continue it			0
we have another big game on tuesday night against @entity176			0
‘ even though it is a friendly we want to keep the winning mentality that the manager has instilled in us			0
we follow his lead and we try to get the ball down to play football that entertains the fans who come along			0
‘ none of like to get beat and you could see that tonight in our performance			2
all 11 men defended at times and then we worked together to create chances			0
we were putting pressure on their defence and eventually it paid off			2
‘ we can do both sides to the game			0
we can defend and we can play football and counter-attack with pace			0
