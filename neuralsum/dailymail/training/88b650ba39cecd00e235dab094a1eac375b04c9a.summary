a 19th - century steamer that was once used to smuggle weapons , transport cash and could still be filled with gold has been found off the coast of @entity5			1
the @entity7 was discovered beneath 40 feet of water off @entity9 , around 30 miles northeast of @entity10 , researcher dr. @entity6 revealed on monday			1
dr @entity6 first discovered the 1028 - ton , 126 - foot ship in 1979 while carrying out a magnetometer survey , but only positively identified it this year while carrying out research on other ships			1
the researcher and treasure hunter , who is officially recognized as its ' true and exclusive owner ' , is now hopeful that it will still contain stashes of gold after its history as a smuggling ship			2
exciting discovery : dr. @entity6 holds artifacts found aboard the sunken @entity7 in @entity5 the vessel , originally named the @entity27 , was made in @entity28 in 1881 and in 1884 , it towed a dredge used in the construction of the @entity31 from @entity32 to @entity33			1
but the following year , it wrecked in the @entity35 and when it was salvaged and rebuilt , it was renamed the @entity7 after a river in the @entity37 , where it often traveled			1
dr @entity6 told @entity39 that the vessel was used for ' extensive gun and money smuggling to @entity43 '			1
it was also used to carry money , including $ 300,000 in paper money to @entity43 which was being used to replace a previous form of cash			2
top team : he is pictured with dive team leader @entity51 as they hold in tact plates found on the ship discovery : a sidescan sonar image shows the wreckage of the @entity7 beneath the water the vessel , originally named the @entity27 , was made in @entity60 , @entity28 in 1881 and , in 1884 , it towed a dredge ( the @entity62 ) used in the construction of the @entity31 from @entity32 to @entity33			1
but the following year , it wrecked in the @entity35 after drifting on to the reefs			2
the ship was salvaged by an @entity68 steamer and towed to @entity69			0
it was renamed the @entity7 after a river in the @entity37 , where it often traveled			2
@entity39 reported that the vessel was used for ' extensive gun and money smuggling to @entity43 '			2
newspaper articles from the time said that gunpowder guns , rifles and boxes of ammunition were seen on the docks			2
it was also used to carry money , including $ 300,000 in paper money to @entity43 which was being used to replace a previous form of cash			2
in november 1894 , it hit the shoals of @entity9 while traveling from @entity90 to @entity10 and suffered a hole in the engine room compartment			1
the water filled the fire rooms , destroying the engines , and the vessel sank			0
the crew escaped on boats to the shore			0
when the ship headed on her last trip in 1894 , @entity43 's president was believed to be near death , and the vessel would have carried guns or funds for supporting his regime or for fighting it , @entity39 reported			1
it is believed that the funds would have been in gold			0

' we do n't know that anyone searched for her , ' dr @entity6 said			0
' @entity126 accounts said she was traveling in ballast , without cargo			0
this would have discouraged any attempts at salvage ... ' ships reporting themselves as traveling in ballast , often carried money and even other cargo			0
when you are smuggling , the smuggled cargo often is n't listed or is intentionally miss - listed			0
' he positively identified the ship by its engine , size , type of decking and where it was found			1
he said that he is hopeful that whatever is on board the steamer is salvageable as the steamer is ' in surprisingly good condition with most of the ship relatively intact and sitting upright '			0
found : the @entity7 , a 19th - century steamer , has been found 40 feet beneath the water in @entity9 and remains largely in tact			1
researchers believe there could be gold on the ship @entity156 : the team will now fully map the vessel underwater to see how stable it is before digging into it ' whatever is still there , we have good reason to believe at least some of it will be intact , as i have already brought up some unbroken china , ' @entity6 said			1
' as you might guess , i am hoping to find gold , and gold should not only be intact , it should still be shiny			0
' @entity6 and his team , whose work is being funded by @entity175 , will map the wreck and try to determine how structurally sound it is before starting to retrieve it			0
get more updates from dr. @entity6 on his @entity181 page .			0
