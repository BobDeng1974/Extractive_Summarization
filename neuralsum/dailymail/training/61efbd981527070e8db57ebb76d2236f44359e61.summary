by @entity0 it has been a strange old start to the season for @entity3			0
unwanted and un-needed at @entity6 , the striker was deemed surplus to requirements and farmed out on loan to @entity10			2
yet just six games into the season and @entity3 is now the hottest property in @entity14 after he scored a brilliant brace to set the @entity10 on their way to a famous 4 - 0 @entity18 win over @entity19			1
clinical : @entity10 striker @entity3 scored a brace at his side humiliated @entity19 4 - 0 on tuesday @entity23 blow : @entity3 celebrates scoring the first goal in @entity10 ' 4 - 0 victory over @entity19 humiliation : @entity19 assistant manager @entity27 has his head in his hands near the end of the game the 23 - year - old was rightly awarded the man of the match award at @entity35 on tuesday night after tormenting @entity36 for the entire match			1
his first goal , although fortuitous , displayed a real striker 's instinct			0
@entity36 passed the ball straight to @entity42 , who put the ball into @entity3 's path and the striker placed by ball past @entity47			0
the second was arguably even more impressive , however			0
@entity3 ghosted in behind @entity49 and , with no @entity19 centre - backs in sight , chested a pinpoint cross into the back of the net			0
tuesday night 's displayed represented quite a turnaround for a player whose stock had fallen immeasurably since his £ 325,000 move from @entity59 to @entity10 in july 2013			1
back of the net : @entity3 slots home his first , and @entity10 ' first , against @entity19 on tuesday night finish : @entity3 chests the ball into the net for his second goal during the @entity18 second round tie man of the match : @entity3 holds his bottle of @entity68 aloft after @entity10 ' 4 - 0 victory over @entity19 @entity70 in shock as @entity10 stun @entity19 the five - cap @entity73 striker had scored 20 goals in 45 games during the 2012 - 13 season for the @entity77 and arrived in @entity78 with a glowing reputation			1
but last season was not kind to the former @entity82 striker			0
a return of just five goals in 34 league appearances led to him falling down the pecking order and , eventually , shipped out on a season - long loan			1
he has scored just once in @entity10 ' first four league games but his brace against @entity19 could kickstart a goal - scoring spree			1
@entity10 boss @entity93 has described @entity3 as someone with ' pedigree ' who is ' a goalscorer at this ( @entity97 ) level '			0
well , after his match - winning display against @entity101 's @entity19 side , perhaps he has ambitions to prove his worth at an even high level than that in the future			2
@entity107 : @entity3 runs to the corner in celebration after scoring his second goal at @entity35 on tuesday night helpless : @entity47 ( right ) can only watch as @entity3 chests in the ball to score his second goal of the night victory : @entity115 runs to the corner with his arms out wide to celebrate scoring his second goal against @entity19			2

will @entity3 and @entity120 both scored twice as @entity10 won 4 - 0
@entity3 opened the scoring at @entity35 with an *opportunistic* goal
the 23 - year - old *doubled* his side 's *advantage* with a chested finish
he scored just five goals in 34 league games for @entity6 last season
@entity3 was unwanted at @entity6 and sent out on loan to @entity10
the @entity137 striker signed for @entity6 in july 2013 for £ 325,000
he had netted 20 goals in 45 games for @entity59 during 2012 - 13 season
@entity19 manager @entity101 is yet to win a *competitive* game
dons *progress* into the third round of @entity18 at @entity19 's *expense*
