and while most girls wore outfits their parents had splashed out hundreds of pounds on @entity11 proudly sported a pink princess dress purchased from an indoor market in @entity35 and decorated with jewels bought off @entity37			1
and after impressing the judges , the rags - to - riches youngster was crowned the world 's perfect pre-teen winning a trophy and $ 2,000 ( £ 1282 )			2
@entity11 's mother april , who lives with @entity11 as well as her other daughter @entity43 , 17 , and twin sons @entity45 and @entity46 , five , in @entity47 , @entity48 , said : ' i 'm very proud of her - she has only been competing for the last 18 months			1

she has got a good reputation in the @entity2 and we travel all over the country for pageants			1
' everyone thinks it is all glamorous and expensive but it is what you make it			0
' i 'm not one who splashes out or wastes money			0
when it comes to @entity78 's outfits , a lot of them are either bought off @entity37 or we create an outfit of our own			1
' for the evening gowns , i will go to the rag market to get the dresses or material and @entity78 will draw up what she wants			2
' i 've got a friend who used to be dress maker who makes them for me and i buy her some flowers to say thanks			2
' for her evening gown for @entity8 i paid £ 20 for the dress and bought some diamantes for £ 25 from @entity37			1
' @entity11 impressed judges in rounds including summer wear and formal wear - as well as shining during the interview stage @entity11 at the @entity98 competition - one of the first @entity8 style beauty pageants to be held in the @entity2 , which was hailed by children 's charities as ' disturbing ' while pageants have traditionally been a purely @entity8 phenomenon , with competitions across the @entity107 regularly filmed for downmarket reality shows such as @entity109 , they are becoming increasingly common in @entity2			1
the trend has attracted criticism from parenting groups and children 's charities about the sexualisation of children			1
the director of children 's charity @entity117 , @entity120 , warned recently : ' these children are so young , it 's impossible for them to be giving their consent to wearing swimwear and pseudo-evening dresses , as well as fake eyelashes and spray tans			1
' and @entity11 took part in the controversial miss @entity98 pageant , which saw children as young as 20 months participating			1
while organisers hailed the pageant as a great success , child welfare groups criticised it for encouraging the ‘ over-sexualisation ’ of young girls			0
@entity120 , director of child protection charity @entity117 , described the pageants as a ' disturbing trend ' , adding : ' it ’s impossible for some of these kids to be giving their consent to wearing swimwear and pseudo-evening dresses as well as fake eyelashes and spray tans			2
' but @entity11 's mother insists that far from damaging her daughter , entering the pageant has been a positive experience			1
there has been a lot of criticism regarding the pageant phenomenon with children 's charities arguing that it sexualises children and the teaching assistant said she disagrees with the negative publicity normally associated with the controversial competitions			1
she added : ' i think a lot of criticism comes from people who are only basing it from shows they see with the little girls			0
' i agree with the little ones because i do n't think it 's right to put a two - year - old in fake tan or fake eyelashes			0
' @entity78 does wear make - up but it is age appropriate			0
she does n't wear it normally or every day			0
inspired : the contests have inspired @entity11 to become a fashion designer confidence boost : her mother says that @entity11 has had a real confidence boost and made some great friends by entering the pageants ' she will put a bit of lip gloss on if she is going out for a family meal or to the cinema but she does n't cake it on			1
' for the pageants obviously the make - up has to be a bit more because it 's on a stage so it 's the same as if it was in the theatre			2
' but everything has to go by me and if i 'm not happy then i wo n't allow her to wear it			0
i would n't let her go out wearing what my 17 - year - old wears			0
' @entity11 has also won a modelling contract and a photoshoot as part of her prize but april says they only enter pageants if they have time			2
the pageants have even inspired @entity11 to want to become a fashion designer when she grows up and april maintains that they have improved her confidence			2
@entity78 said : ' my favourite part of them is meeting up with friends and making new ones and dressing up and spending time with my mom ' the single mother added : ' she has never been big - headed or let it get to her head for all the things she has won			0
' if there is a pageant coming up i will ask @entity78 if she wants to go and if we have nothing on then we will go			0
' i never forced her			0
she has made friends with other pageant girls and it has improved her confidence			0
' @entity78 said : ' my favourite part of them is meeting up with friends and making new ones and dressing up and spending time with my mom			0
' i practice with my mom in the front room or if i am doing talent or have a routine we make it up together then i practice in my room as well as in the front with my mom whenever i have spare time			0
