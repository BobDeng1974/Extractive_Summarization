@entity0 face an untimely injury crisis as they prepare to open their @entity3 campaign for another season with one of the toughest trips in @entity7 on tuesday night			1
the @entity8 will come up against @entity9 and the famous ' @entity10 ' at the @entity11 and will have to do so without a number of key personnel in defence			2
@entity15 buy @entity16 will be out for two months after damaging ankle ligaments against @entity18 and @entity19 did not make the trip to @entity21			2
@entity22 is suffering from tonsilitis and is rated ' 50 - 50 ' , leaving @entity25 with a patched - up defence			1
one of those set to step in is 19 - year - old @entity28 , but who is the young star set for a baptism of fire in one of @entity7 's most intimidating arenas			1
@entity28 in @entity0 training ahead of @entity0 's @entity3 visit to @entity9 @entity25 faces a selection dilemma in defence after injuries to @entity16 , @entity22 and @entity19 , meaning that @entity28 could start at right - back in the @entity11 @entity16 damaged ankle ligaments against @entity18 and could miss two months name : @entity28 age : 19 club : @entity0 @entity42 : right - back i 'm going to need more than that ... @entity28 certainly wo n't be fazed by the prospect of stepping out in front of 80,000 fans at the @entity11 on tuesday night			1
this is a player who has been crafted for big occasions like this , first at @entity52 and then at @entity0 , and is going places in his career - very quickly			0
his performances on the right - hand side of defence for @entity0 's under 21 side over the last couple of seasons caught the eye of @entity25 and the manager clearly feels @entity28 is ready to make the leap into the first team			1
he also gained valuable experience - and impressed plenty - in his eight championship appearances for @entity67 during the middle of last season			0
the highlight came at @entity71 , when @entity28 's lung - busting 70 yard run from the edge of his own penalty area helped create a goal for @entity76 in a 3 - 3 draw			2
@entity28 on the ball in an under 21 fixture for @entity0			2
he has caught the eye of @entity25 with his flying performances at right - back at the reserve level @entity28 made his one and only first team appearance in the @entity85 at @entity86 last season			1
he came on in extra time for @entity88 and played in an unfamiliar central midfield role @entity25 recalled him from that loan spell at @entity91 in february but his only senior appearance to date was in the @entity85 win at @entity86 last season , when he came on for the injured @entity88 and played in an unfamiliar central midfield role			0
@entity52 - born @entity28 is at his best when allowed to carry the ball forward from his right - back position			1
he has pace in abundance and the way the ball sticks to his feet betrays his football education both in @entity102 and north @entity103			0
his name hit the headlines when he broke @entity107 's record over the 40m sprint , making him technically the fastest player to ever play for the club			1
@entity107 had earlier stolen the crown from @entity112			0
it 's perhaps explained by the fact he was originally a winger at @entity52 , converting into a right - back only when he moved to @entity103 in the summer of 2011			1
@entity28 shakes hands with @entity117 during training ahead of the @entity3 clash @entity28 takes on @entity121 's @entity120 in an under 21 @entity123 fixture last week @entity28 explained all in an august 2012 interview : ' when i was at @entity52 i always used to play on the right - wing			1
' but last year i learnt a lot from @entity128 about how to defend and every day i feel more and more comfortable as a right - back			1
' @entity28 is well known to the die - hards who watch the @entity132 side and the @entity133 at @entity135 's @entity134			1
he contributed two goals and an assist in his seven under 21 @entity123 outings last season either side of his @entity67 loan and played in all but two of @entity0 's maiden @entity133 campaign			1
with @entity25 watching on at the @entity143 a couple of weeks ago , he delivered an inch - perfect cross for @entity146 to head in the second of his hat - trick in the @entity132 21s 4 - 2 win over @entity86			0
his energetic performance in that game - and another in front of the @entity154 cameras when @entity0 beat @entity121 2 - 0 last thursday - was sufficient to confirm to @entity25 that he is ready			1
@entity28 gained valuable first team experience at @entity67 in the middle of last season what about international honours ? @entity28 is currently a @entity160 under 19 international and has made eight appearances so far			0
he previously represented his country at @entity163 and under 17 level , receiving his first cap in 2011			0
he blotted his copybook at the @entity167 in @entity168 , getting sent off in @entity160 opening match with @entity170 and was not able to appear again until the semi-finals			0
@entity28 played the entire match against @entity173 but his team were eliminated 2 - 1 after extra time , ending their title defence			0
what 's his style ? @entity28 's natural instinct is to bomb forward when in possession of the ball , getting white paint on his boots and taking on defenders			2
this is all well and good in under 21 matches but @entity28 will have to show greater discipline if selected against @entity9			2
@entity28 tackles @entity189 's @entity188 during an under 21 match last season against @entity195 's talented side , if he goes all gung - ho and gets stranded up the pitch , @entity0 could be left exposed			1
@entity25 will certainly stress this in his pre-match team talk and @entity28 will have to cocnentrate on his defensive duties			2
while we possibly wo n't see much evidence of it on tuesday , @entity28 is an exciting player to watch going forward and , as mentioned , is sometimes hard to differentiate from a flying winger			2
he has dramatic acceleration that leaves opponents trailing , skills , trickery and a magnetic touch			0
he is also adept at picking out forwards with his crossing			0
in terms of the defensive attributes , @entity28 is sound too			0
his tracking back and tackling are of the standard you would expect and will yet be further polished with greater experience			0
he does sometimes get caught out of position when the opposition counter-attack but at least has the pace to track back			0
@entity28 beats @entity220 's @entity219 to the ball in the air during a championship match at @entity91 what happens next ? hopefully , @entity28 can produce a strong performance if given the responsibility against @entity9 and raise his profile			2
with @entity16 out for a while , this is a superb opportunity for him to impress in the first team and give @entity25 a selection headache			0
even if he does n't feature in @entity21 , there are plenty of matches coming up in which he should play			0
at 19 , he still has plenty of time on his side and there 's no doubt he is very highly - regarded by @entity25 and everyone at the club .			1

@entity28 could start for @entity0 against @entity9 in the @entity3 on tuesday
@entity25 has been left with an injury crisis after @entity16 and @entity19 were ruled out . @entity22 is 50 - 50
right - back @entity28 could take @entity16 's place at the @entity11
19 - year - old @entity247 loves to get forward and attack
he broke @entity107 's club sprint record
@entity28 impressed @entity25 with his performances for the @entity254 and the @entity255 in the @entity133
