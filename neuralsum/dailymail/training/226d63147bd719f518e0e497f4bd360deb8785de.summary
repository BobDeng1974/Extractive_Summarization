the @entity1 has lost track of 174,000 illegal immigrants and is struggling to find them , a report revealed today			1
the dossier , which home secretary @entity5 has been accused of suppressing , found three - quarters of foreigners refused permission to stay in @entity9 have vanished			2
the scandal of huge numbers of ‘ over-stayers ’ – migrants who remain in the @entity9 even though their visas have expired – was exposed in a scathing study by the independent immigration watchdog			1
home secretary @entity5 arrived for a cabinet meeting at 10 @entity18 in @entity19 this morning ahead of a damning report by the chief borders inspector @entity21 @entity21 , the chief inspector of @entity22 and @entity23 , highlighted the fiasco as the latest in a string of glaring gaps in border controls			1
mr @entity21 , who has clashed with mrs may over the timing of the release of several reports , revealed that pre-december 2008 , about 232,000 foreigners had applications for visa extensions to allow them to live in the @entity9 rejected			1
the @entity35 – now replaced by the @entity36 – should have ensured they left the country , but out of that number , only 58,000 have been tracked down , and either forced to go home or are awaiting deportation			1
it means 174,000 illegal ‘ overstayers ’ could not be found			1
mr @entity21 ’s report said that 80 per cent of students who are given visas to study here for four years do not leave after that period elapses			1
some 85 per cent of sham marriage grooms are students			0
officials have also failed to carry out basic checks on more than 200,000 migrants applying for @entity9 citizenship every year			1
@entity21 , the chief inspector of @entity22 and @entity23 , found the @entity1 have lost 174,000 illegal immigrants the @entity36 has only managed to track down 58,000 illegal immigrants who have gone missing ' stooge wife ' : @entity57 with boyfriend @entity58 by @entity59 the ringleader of a sham marriage gang used his own girlfriend as a ‘ stooge wife ’ , marrying her to strangers for £ 8,000			1
@entity58 , 29 , organised a string of lucrative fake ceremonies and ‘ pressured ’ women to take part			0
his girlfriend , @entity57 , 28 , was one of several bogus brides who would marry foreign nationals for £ 8,000 a time so that they could stay in the @entity9			0
@entity58 , along with @entity73 , 66 , paid the women to marry strangers from @entity75 and @entity76 , a court heard			0
both men , along with @entity57 and two other fake brides were jailed on monday after a judge said they had shown ‘ total disrespect for the institution of marriage and @entity9 immigration laws ’			0
mr @entity21 ’s report – which has sat on mrs may ’s desk for months – heaped fresh humiliation on the beleaguered department			2
the home secretary will also face questions on why she chose to ‘ bury ’ the document on the day before @entity93 ’ @entity95 recess and at the same time as the @entity97 report into allegations that @entity9 soldiers murdered and tortured @entity101 detainees is published			2
earlier this year , mps accused @entity1 officials who admitted they had no idea where the missing immigrants and failed asylum seekers were of ‘ unacceptable complacency ’			1
despite being ordered out of the country , many had ‘ gone to ground ’ and were working in the so - called black economy , illegally claiming benefits and even voting in elections , the @entity109 ’ public accounts committee found			0
mps said the shambles had worsened and called for ‘ urgent steps ’ to sort out the ‘ mess ’			0
it is understood there are an additional 3,000 illegal immigrants who need to be removed every week , a figure that does not include foreign offenders or refugees whose request for asylum has been rejected			2
last week , a damning report by mr @entity21 revealed @entity1 staff had given @entity9 passports to tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and foreign criminals , including at least one murderer			1
the relationship between mr @entity21 and mrs may plunged into the deep freeze last year after a critical report on border security was – in an unprecedented move – censored by the home secretary			2
until this year , the watchdog decided when his reports were published			0
but after six years and 50 reports , often exposing @entity143 failures , mrs may seized control of the timing			0
mr @entity21 will leave his post later this month – six months early			2
shadow immigration minister @entity148 said : ‘ @entity5 has sought to bury reports because they lay bare the total chaos within her own department			0
they have exposed a murderer granted @entity9 citizenship , a growing asylum backlog and 175,000 people here illegally who have disappeared			1
’ the @entity1 said : ‘ this government has ended the system under which the dna of innocent people was kept indefinitely – but we will never put the public at risk			0
police can keep dna and fingerprints from any @entity165 national who represents a threat to the public			0
