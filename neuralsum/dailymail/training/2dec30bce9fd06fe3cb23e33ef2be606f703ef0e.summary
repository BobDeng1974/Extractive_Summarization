these stunning photos capture the spectacular scenes in @entity2 last night - where the @entity3 illuminated the sky with colour			1
the deep purple and green bands of shimmering light were caught by award - winning photographer @entity9 - who spends much of his time snapping the aurora borealis			1
the pictures were taken in @entity13 , north @entity2 - where people were treated to an extraordinary rare glimpse of the phenomenon			1
' it 's always intriguing and awe - inspiring and it 's a very photogenic subject			0
i really like the dynamism of the whole spectacle			0
' i could watch them every night and never get bored			0
' the display is usually only seen from more northerly locations such as @entity33 , @entity34 and parts of @entity36			0
but recent solar flares have meant electrically - charged particles - which are the cause of the light displays - have appeared further south than usual			1
recent solar flares have meant electrically - charged particles - which are the cause of the light displays - have appeared further south than usual last night , a solar flare hurled vast clouds of these particles towards @entity44 – producing displays such as this one , not only in @entity2 , but also in some parts of north @entity47			1
known as coronal mass ejections , the clouds can produce an array of colours including green , pink , red , blue and yellow			0
mr @entity9 added : ' i was expecting the aurora display because a big explosion on the sun was reported with clouds of ejected plasma coming towards earth			2
last night , a solar flare hurled vast clouds of these particles towards @entity44 – producing displays such as this one ' there was a forecast for a big geomagnetic storm of @entity69 level , with potential for a sparkling aurora visible as far south as the south of @entity47			1
' we are still close to the peak of activity of the sun , which is main cause of the auroras , so we can still expect some good displays in the months ahead			0
' mr @entity9 , who is also a structural engineer , said he was lucky to get such good results as it seemed the elements were against him			2
the deep purple and green bands of shimmering light were caught by photographer @entity9 - who spends much of his time snapping the aurora borealis he said : ' on the photographs , the aurora looks quite clear but to the naked eye the display was not so obvious , as there was very bright moonlight in the sky washing out faint aurora details			1
' the air was very foggy and there were plenty of clouds around so i spent more time driving around looking for clear locations than actually taking pictures			0
' the best nights for observing auroras is when the @entity106 is out of the sky and it is really dark			0
' mr @entity9 said ' every aurora display is unique and you never know how it will develop over time - it 's always intriguing and awe - inspiring '			2

spectacular images of aurora borealis were taken by photographer @entity9 in @entity13 , north @entity2
displays were also visible from @entity47 last night - which is *extremely* *unusual* so far from the @entity116
thought that large solar explosion forced electrically - charged particles , which cause the phenomenon , further south
