@entity0 today hinted at hefty tax rises for people earning more than £ 80,000 a year			1
the party also indicated that profitable companies could be hit as @entity0 attempts to tackle the deficit without trimming @entity7 ’s bloated welfare budget or imposing deep spending cuts			2
@entity9 has been deliberately vague about @entity0 ’s plans to raise taxes to deal with the deficit , identifying only his proposal to reinstate the 50p tax rates , which experts warn may raise nothing			1
he suggested that those earning more than £ 80,000 were rich and could bear to pay more			1
mr @entity20 said @entity0 would not hit those on ‘ middle and lower incomes ’ , with taxes mainly rising for those on higher salaries			1
he added : ‘ if you look at people on middle and lower incomes – this is n’t only people on £ 10,000 or £ 20,000 a year , it ’s £ 50 , £ 60 , £ 70 , £ 80,000 a year – they are paying more tax			1
' he added : ' people on all these income levels are in our mind			0
what we want to do is find a way in which we can balance the books in the next parliament , get the debt falling but to do so in a way which is fair to people on middle and lower incomes who are paying quite a lot of tax already			0
‘ i ca n’t come along today and start making detailed tax policy – that ’s for manifestos and budgets – but we ’ve already been clear – our plans add up without a rise in tax on people on middle and low incomes			2
‘ people on the income levels ( i am ) talking about are very much in our minds when we talk about middle and lower incomes			0
’ @entity0 – which has ruled out rises in the headline rates of @entity67 , income tax and national insurance – also left itself lots of flexibility to raise corporation tax on company profits			2
@entity76 , at a rally in @entity75 today , has claimed @entity0 will cost families £ 3,000 in tax rises over the next @entity79 mr @entity9 said @entity0 would ensure @entity7 ’s corporation tax rate remains the ‘ lowest in the @entity81 ’			1
but this would allow a @entity0 government to raise it from 20 per cent to 26.5 per cent , which is the rate charged by @entity85 , the second most competitive country in the @entity81			2
by contrast , the @entity87 have said they will keep the rate as the lowest in the @entity89 , which is currently 20 per cent in @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			0
meanwhile , @entity0 was boosted last night after the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) challenged @entity95 claims about the party ’s spending plans			2
@entity76 claimed yesterday that a @entity0 victory would lead to £ 15 billion of tax rises , costing families an average £ 3,000 each over the lifetime of the next parliament			1
@entity0 dismissed the claim , saying it was based on ‘ made up figures ’			0
the @entity93 also criticised the @entity95 figures , saying they were based on too many assumptions about @entity0 ’s opaque tax and spending plans			1
the independent think tank said there was ‘ little value in bandying around numbers which suggest either party would increase taxes by an average of £ 3,000 for each working household ’			0
@entity93 director @entity117 said there was ‘ some potential truth ’ in the @entity95 claim , but said it was ‘ unhelpful ’ to make a claim based on so many unknown assumptions			0
shadow treasury chief secretary @entity124 said : ‘ this is a disastrous and embarrassing start to @entity76 ’s campaign			0
within hours of making totally false claims about @entity0 on the steps of @entity129 , the @entity93 has totally undermined them			0

shadow chancellor has been deliberately vague about @entity0 *'s* tax plans
@entity20 said taxes would only hit those with the ' broadest shoulders '
but he suggested those earning over £ 80,000 could bear to pay more
