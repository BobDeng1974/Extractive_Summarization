but for a true intake of breath , wait till you see what it costs to enjoy them			2
the £ 2billion building ’s viewing platforms were opened to the public yesterday , but with tickets costing £ 24.95 for an adult and £ 18.95 for a child , it ’s not just a fear of heights that might make visitors think twice			1
‘ it ’s like something prodding up through the frail integuments of the planet like an intergalactic spear , ’ he said as he cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony			2
( in case you were wondering , an integument is defined in the @entity56 as ‘ that with which anything is covered , enclosed , or clothed ; a covering , investment , coating ’			2
warming to his theme , mr @entity42 enthused : ‘ it ’s like the tip of a cocktail stick emerging through the skin of a super-colossal pickled onion			2
it looks as though it ’s growing			2
‘ it looks as though subterranean forces are pushing it up so it will reach your [ the designers ’ ] vision of 400m which , of course , air traffic controllers refused to allow you to do			2
’ atmospheric : the view of @entity5 's financial district and @entity82 from the top of @entity1 in @entity5 today unrivalled views : visitors can see other @entity5 landmarks such as @entity88 skyscraper , pictured to the left , situated in @entity90 the viewing room : the first members of the public to gain entry to @entity30 at the @entity1 building enjoy the view at the attraction which was officially opened today visitors to the attraction - on floors 68 , 69 and 72 - are whisked up in two high - speed lifts in around 60 seconds			1
on a clear day , visitors enjoy a 360 - degree view of the capital ’s skyline to up to 40 miles from a platform almost twice the height of any other in the city			1
with the help of specially - designed telescopes , they should be able to pick out @entity5 ’s landmarks in the streets below			0
those using the telescopes will , by focusing on a particular landmark , receive audible information about it			0
but visibility was restricted for the dignitaries , journalists and members of the public attending the launch this morning because of wet and cloudy weather			0
mr @entity42 described the building as ' a most amazing place '			1

lifts travelling at six metres a second whizz you up to the platforms where you peer through the floor - to - ceiling windows made of reinforced – but only 12mm - thick – glass			0
the platforms are the only places where it is possible to see all of @entity5 at once , with the 40 - mile views taking in the @entity165 , @entity166 ’s , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and the @entity170			1
‘ @entity30 ’ has sold out this weekend , with more than 135,000 tickets snapped up			0
but even with tickets for a family of four not giving you much change from £ 100 , @entity175 , the attraction ’s chief executive , expects a million visitors this year			1
he said : ‘ all of our tickets offer a no - queue experience			0
if you look at fast - track prices of other attractions , we are great value for money			0
’ tickets for the @entity1 are ‘ queue free ’ because they are booked in advance , with visitors choosing the time and date of their visit			1
among the first in at 9am yesterday were couple @entity193 and @entity195			0
