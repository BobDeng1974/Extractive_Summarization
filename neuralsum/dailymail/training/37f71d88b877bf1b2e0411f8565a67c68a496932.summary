care : the archaeologists are also putting lots of care into uncovering the @entity58 era graves they have uncovered while working on their excavations of the mammoths who died thousands of years earlier huge job : @entity9 archaeologists have called on their colleagues in @entity89 and @entity90 are set to help uncover the bones in a dig which is expected to last at least six months @entity75 said : ' this discovery is interesting because , unusually , there are many bones in one place , probably brought there by torrential waters			1
' @entity26 said @entity9 archaeologists already have contacted colleagues in @entity89 and @entity90 for consultation			1

it will take more than six months to unearth all the woolly mammoth bones
@entity89 and @entity90 experts have been called in to help with the *project*
the find will give important insight about the @entity30 during the ice age
