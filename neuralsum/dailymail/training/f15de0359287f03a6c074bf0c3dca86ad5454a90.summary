but following the radical surgery , she has just one or two seizures a week and is finally living a normal life			1
the surgery can take up to two years to recover from so it is hoped the frequency of @entity26 ’s seizures will continue to decrease			1
she said : ' my friends were very supportive , but i could n’t go out alone , even just to walk the dog			0
' i felt like i ’d been robbed of growing up because of my epilepsy			1

' @entity26 had the operation in october last year , just after her 21st birthday			2

@entity59 said : ' going into brain surgery was scary , but i was more focused on how it could change my life afterwards			2
' they did n’t know until i woke up how it would have affected my memory , or even if i ’d still be able to speak			2
' my mum said she ’s never been happier to hear me ask for a blanket			0
' @entity26 ’s seizures began as complex partial seizures , where she would lose consciousness for a few seconds , but as time went on she also suffered grand mal seizures , with muscle convulsions			1
she said : ' it just felt like i was asleep for a few seconds , i just went completely blank - and then i would come straight back into the conversation			2
recovery : doctors are hoping that @entity26 , pictured with her mother @entity81 , will suffer from far fewer seizures in future ' when the seizures first started i would say " what " all the time , but that changed to " i feel sick "			1
i did n’t know i was saying it			0
