best - selling author and self - styled weight loss guru @entity1 was sentenced monday to 10 years in prison for bilking consumers through late night infomercials			1
@entity1 's book ' the @entity5 ' they ' do n't want you to know about ' sold more than 850,000 copies at $ 30 a piece through oft - played tv infomercials a federal judge decided were part of a con			1
a $ 37million judgement was also entered against him			1
the pitchman 's lawyer argued the sentence was too harsh and said the most anyone lost through his commercials was $ 30 , but the judge disagreed , calling him a habitual fraudster			1
@entity1 has been an ' unrepentant , untiring , and uncontrollable huckster who has defrauded the unsuspecting for 30 years , ' said @entity27 district court judge @entity26			1
' since his 20s , he has steadfastly attempted to cheat others for his own gain , ' the judge continued , adding that @entity1 is ' deceitful to the very core			1
' @entity1 's trademark dyed black hair turned partially gray while sitting in jail , he showed little emotion as the stiff sentence was handed down at the hearing in @entity32			2
he insisted he 's become a changed man while addressing the judge just before sentencing , saying he 's meditated , prayed and read self - help books while locked up at @entity32 's @entity31			0
' i have truly had a significant reawakening , ' said @entity1 , who was dressed in orange jail clothes			2
' if i ever do an infomercial again ... i promise : no embellishments , no puffery , no lies			0
' a @entity1 supporter interrupted @entity26 as he read his judgement			2
that person then cut the judge short a second time and was carried out by a @entity64			0
neither @entity1 's pleas for leaniency or the supporter 's words were enough to sway the judge after jurors convicted @entity1 of criminal contempt in november for defying a 2004 court order barring him from running false ads about the weight - loss book			1
chart - topper : the best - selling book ' @entity77 ' by @entity1 stands on display at a @entity80 bookstore august 22 , 2005 in @entity81 , @entity81 despite the order , he aired the infomercials at least 32,000 times , according to prosecutors			1
he sold more than 850,000 copies of the weight - loss book , generating $ 39 million in revenue , prosecutors say			2
and the judge agreed with prosecutors that the amount of loss stemming from @entity1 's deception was more than $ 37 million — nearly the amount in revenue			1
but in remarks monday asking for a sentence of less than two years for his client , defense attorney @entity97 said the harm @entity1 caused was minor compared to fraud in which some people are cheated out of their life savings			1
' a 10 - year sentence might be appropriate for a defendant who destroyed lives , ' @entity97 said			0
' ( but ) @entity1 — if he swindled anyone — swindled them out of $ 30 ( the price of the book )			1
' @entity1 made late - night infomercials for more that 20 years			1
doctors have expressed concern in the past about his book @entity77 they do n't want you to know about which has sold more than five million copies and appeared at the top of non-fiction bestseller lists			0
his claims include : ' the sun does not cause cancer			0
sun block has been shown to cause cancer			0
' another one of his statements is that @entity130 is ' one of the greatest hoaxes and deceptions ever perpetrated on the @entity27 public '			0
the @entity135 first came after @entity1 in 1998 for making false claims on tv			2
he claimed his alternative medicines could cause dramatic weight loss and cure addictions to alcohol , cigarettes and heroin			0
he even said the herbal remedies could give users a photographic memory			0
more than 25 million @entity27 have purchased products from @entity148			0
a look at some of the steps @entity1 recommended to people looking to lose weight might provide some insight into why the judge felt otherwise			1
@entity1 's ' @entity5 ' they ' do n't want you to know about ' involved a three step process detailed in a @entity159 critique			2
step one involved switching over to an all - organic diet , colonics and liver cleanses , among other steps			0
step two was to take daily injections of human chorionicgonadotropin , an enzyme found in urine that has not been approved for use as a weight loss treatment in the @entity27			0
step three involved eating anything the dieter wanted , as long as it was organic , while continuing the cleanses but stopping the injections			0
the fourth and final step includes cleansing of the kidneys and liver , as well as ridding one 's body of parasites and metals			0
it is notable that @entity1 has no medical certifications and has written other books touting the benefits of holistic medicine			1
' he preys on the fears of consumers , giving them someone to blame for their overweight or obese conditions , ' @entity189 , ld @entity190 writes on the site			0
another defense attorney , @entity198 , added that @entity1 's legal troubles had already cost him his businesses and his home , and nearly all his other worldly possessions			1
' he has a suitcase containing his personal artifacts			0
that 's what he has left , ' she said			0
but @entity26 showed little sympathy , appearing angry as he said that @entity1 had thumbed his nose at the justice system by violating multiple court orders since the 1990s ' he has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions ... or impediments to be side - stepped , out - maneuvered or just ignored , ' the judge said			2
@entity1 's weight - loss book describes a grueling , 500 - calorie - a - day diet , as well as hormone treatments			1
the deception , @entity26 explained , came in @entity1 's infomercials that misrepresented the contents of the book as laying out ' a simple , no hunger ... diet - free method of losing weight , ' which enticed more people to buy the book			1
@entity1 became rich selling millions of books with titles such as ' @entity77 ' they ' do n't want you to know about ' and ' @entity232 ' they ' do n't want you to know about , ' touting them in commercials using sometimes hour - long news - interview formats			1
as legal scrutiny intensified over the years , @entity1 claimed the @entity27 government was out to get him , and he accused agencies and other vested interests of conspiring to suppress low - cost , common remedies to diseases , including cancer			2
his weight - loss book , which once topped best - seller lists , was the focus of the criminal conviction for which he was sentenced			0
it also was the subject of related civil case brought by the @entity135 , in which @entity1 was ordered to pay a $ 37 million judgment			1
in that civil case , @entity1 said he could n't pay the judgment because he 's broke			2
but @entity135 lawyers balked at that claim , accusing him of hiding money in shell companies			0
@entity1 , they noted , has spent lavishly in recent years , including $ 359 on two haircuts .			2

@entity1 was found *guilty* of defrauding *hundreds* of *thousands* of people out of $ 37million
he was *previously* ordered to stop selling the books in 2004 but continued airing infomercials
his lawyer argued that he did not cause any harm , that all anyone lost was the $ 30 cost of the book
