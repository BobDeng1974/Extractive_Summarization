@entity0 planned to air a sketch about the @entity3 , @entity4 protests this weekend , but cut the controversial sketch because the show was short on time			1
@entity8 has now released the dress - rehearsal version of the sketch online , which follows morning show hosts in @entity12 trying to remain cheery about a night of violent demonstrations for police shooting victim @entity14			1
instead , the show tackled the national protests over police brutality on @entity17 and with a a sketch about @entity20 's reaction to a @entity23 grand jury 's decision not to indict the @entity25 officer who killed @entity26			1
@entity52 , who hosted the december 7 episode , appears as a chef promoting his new cookbook who has the unfortunate name of @entity40 - just a letter difference to @entity58 , the police officer who shot dead @entity14			0
appearing to give updates on the traffic is new castmember @entity61 , who eventually abandons the show and flies her helicopter out of @entity12			1
' is that the @entity66 skyline ? ' @entity29 ask			0
' hell yes , and i am not coming back , ' @entity67 replies			0
the clip finishes with @entity29 deciding to end ' rise and @entity46 ' 53 minutes early , when a visiting quartet starts singing @entity75 's @entity74 's hit ' we did n't start the fire '			0
more than a dozen @entity3 businesses were torched in the @entity14 protests			1
bye : new castmember @entity61 plays a traffic reporter who decides to flee @entity12 for @entity66 cut the tape : @entity29 decides to end the show 53 minutes early when a singing quartet starts singing the questionable song ' we did n't start the fire ' before each live televised show , snl hosts a dress rehearsal where they run through all of the sketches in contention , and cut segments for time or that do n't register enough laughs with the studio audience			2
it 's unclear why the snl producers ultimately decided to nix the sketch , though they were clearly proud enough to release it online in it 's unpolished version			2
race has been a tricky subject for @entity0 in the past , and just last season was criticized for the lack of diversity among the cast			0
that led show creator @entity107 to start a nationwide search for a black female cast member , which ultimately ended in the mid-season hiring of @entity112			2
four of the 15 current repertory and featured castmembers are @entity115 with this season 's addition of @entity67 .			0
