by @entity1 reporter published : 01:58 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 05:49 est , 4 november 2013 the trial of accused 9/11 terrorists held in @entity4 wo n’t officially begin for a year , but lawyers on both sides are already complaining about unprecedented challenges in what is the largest war crimes tribunal since the @entity9			2
defense lawyers for men accused of helping kill thousands of @entity12 on september 11 call the trial an unjust charade and claim the @entity15 has illegally monitored meetings between them and their clients , even going so far as to use a fake smoke detector without even the prosecution ’s knowledge			1
chief prosecutor army brigadier general @entity21 said he was swamped by untrue accusations that his evidence did not count because much of it was obtained during advanced interrogation like waterboarding			1
justice ? lawyers for three of the 9/11 defendants say the trial has become a charade before it has even begun ‘ this is not a system that is set up to deliver justice , ’ @entity32 , the attorney for the admitted mastermind of 9/11 @entity34 , told 60 minutes for their segment about the upcoming trial , which aired sunday			1
mr @entity32 claims his client was waterboarded 183 times in a single month			2
while mr @entity32 filed a declaration that showed how his client had been treated , and under what conditions he confessed , the declaration had been censored because the military said its contents were classified			2
@entity32 also described a moment in the courtroom in january when a big red hockey light went off as he spoke			2
the not - so - subtle light is to be lit by the judge or the court 's security officer - and only when classified information is disclosed			2
journey : it 's the first @entity12 war crimes trial since @entity9 and it will be held in over a year in @entity4 , @entity57			1
every six weeks , 250 lawyers and other court personnel are flown to @entity57 at a cost of $ 90,000 chief prosecutor brigadier general @entity21 insists the law is being followed and denies the assertion that a legal admission of guilt ca n't follow harsh coercion techniques like waterboarding after a certain amount of time has elapsed but neither the judge nor the security officer turned the light on			1
and mr @entity32 claims he had n’t disclosed anything classified			0
when the judge investigated , it was determined that the @entity15 had hit the light - and it is n’t the only time the agency had made its presence in the military proceeding			1
attorney @entity79 , who represents @entity80 , believes she once caught the @entity15 red handed			1
she said : ‘ i 'm meeting with my client in a room			0
and , up on the ceiling , like you would normally find in a jail with a client , there 's a smoke detector			0
silenced : @entity79 represents @entity80			0
she says she caught the @entity15 illegally monitoring her meetings with her client using a fake smoke detector , and that she 's not legally allowed to even discuss whether he was waterboarded does he deserve it ? @entity32 represents @entity34 , the admitted mastermind of 9/11			1
he says his client was waterboarded 183 times in a month but he 's being censored from presenting it in his defense alerted : @entity32 said this light in the @entity102 courtroom , designed to alert the court when someone has divulged classified info , mysteriously went off - and it turned out to the the @entity15 listening in ‘ and one day i 'm sitting in there and my client stops one of the correctional guards and says , " that 's - what is that ? you 're listening , are n't you ? "			1
the guard says , " of course we 're not listening			0
that 's a smoke detector ”			0
’ she said she believed the guard but decided to investigate anyway , and got a big surprise when she googled the smoke detector 's manufacturer			0
she said : ‘ it turns out that they only make listening devices that are intended to look like smoke detectors and other surreptitious listening devices			0
we find this out while we 're in @entity4			0
’ mr @entity32 said the government refused to disclose why , how , or even if the @entity15 was monitoring the 9/11 detainees , over 150 of whom had not been charged with a crime in their 12 years at @entity4			1
constitutional loophole ? the defense complains that the constitution has been ' kicked down the road ' in @entity4 as over 150 detainees remain there , still without being charged , after 12 years ' we 've got to ensure that what we do in these cases is justice and ca n't be accused of being vengeance , ' said @entity21			1
' and that 's a great challenge			0
' colonel @entity21 said the proceedings were being handled in accordance with the law , and said he did n’t know who , for instance , turned on the red light			1
as for the years - long wait for trial , mr @entity32 said : ‘ that 's one of the reasons i have a sense of urgency to try everybody that we can try			2
' while ms @entity79 said she could n't even discuss any classified torture her client might or might not have undergone ( or else face up to 30 years in prison ) , colonel @entity21 insisted the evidence he using was obtained from a so - called ‘ clean - team ’ sent in after president @entity163 banned advanced interrogation			1
besides , he said : ‘ justice requires that you look deeper			0
‘ the people do not forfeit their chance for accountability because someone may have crossed a line or have coerced or subjected to harsh measures somebody who is in custody			0
' he insisted the trial was being treated just like any other trial in the @entity12 for a @entity12 civilian citizen			1
he said : ‘ the accused is presumed innocent , the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt			0
we 've got to ensure that what we do in these cases is justice and ca n't be accused of being vengeance			0
and that 's a great challenge			0
’ the defense , including @entity190 commander @entity189 - the attorney for @entity191 - disagrees			2
he said : ‘ every day we listen to the national anthem in @entity4 , @entity57 , but yet the constitution has been kicked down the road and is persona non grata in @entity4 , @entity57			2

the defense says @entity15 monitoring , *breaches* of the constitution , and lack of *transparency* have made the trial a charade before it has even begun
chief prosecutor army brigadier general @entity21 says the trial is being handled as it would be for an @entity12 in the @entity12
