ms @entity18 said she just wanted ' the truth ' about her sister 's death earlier this year @entity10 's @entity26 threw out their acquittal and ordered a retrial which is due to begin in the autumn and @entity12 said : ' we are still waiting for answers			1
we just want the truth			0
' it 's difficult to speak of forgiveness when there are still so many unanswered questions			0
to be honest i 'm not sure what we are expecting from the retrial - we all have mixed emotions			0
' for the time being though i 'm happy to be back in @entity11 for a happy event			0
the last time i was here it was under very different circumstances			0
it 's nice to be here for this scholarship in @entity6 's memory			1
' @entity6 loved @entity11 - i remember her telling us all about the chocolate festival when she first got here			2
she was so happy here - then a few weeks later we came over and their were pictures of @entity6 and candles on the cathedral steps			2
' @entity6 had arrived in @entity11 in september 2007 to study @entity10 as part of her @entity57 course and she had shared a house with @entity59 and two other women			1
she was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom			0
@entity59 and @entity16 were arrested and charged - at their first trial they were convicted and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively			2
then two years later in 2011 they were cleared and @entity59 , 25 , immediately flew home to @entity69 where she has recently published a book about her experiences and for which she was paid $ 4 million			0

@entity6 had arrived in @entity11 in september 2007 to study @entity10 as part of her @entity57 course and she had shared a house with @entity15 and two other women @entity15 and @entity16 were cleared of the murder of @entity2			1
earlier this year @entity10 's @entity26 threw out their acquittal and ordered a retrial which is due to begin in the autumn @entity11 city council set up the scholarship thee years ago to honour @entity6 and the first winner @entity91 student @entity20 received the award at a ceremony at the town hall			1
mayor @entity19 said : ' we setup the scholarship because we felt that the true protagonist and the real victim of this tragic event had been forgotten			0
' the city of @entity11 will never forget @entity6 , in fact we want to honour her as she will always be associated with @entity11 and for this reason she should have a place in our memory			2
' so to honour her that 's why we have set up this scholarship aimed at students as @entity6 was in @entity11 studying and it is also our way of strengthening ties with @entity6 's family			1
@entity18 is pictured with @entity112 student @entity20 - the first recipient of the scholarship to remember @entity2 ' that event changed our lives and its a wound that we will always carry in our hearts but at the same time @entity6 will always have a place in the hearts of @entity120			1
she was our guest and we feel a sense of impotency for not defending her			0
' @entity124 's ambassador in @entity125 , @entity126 , said : ' the @entity18 family , @entity6 â€™s friends , and those whose lives @entity6 touched have no need of an occasion in order to remember her			2
' she will be with them always			0
but the generous creation of a scholarship in her name by the authorities in @entity11 will enable other young @entity124 women to study in and appreciate @entity11 , a city @entity6 loved , and to get to know the hospitality of @entity10 , a country which @entity6 so enjoyed visiting			1
' @entity20 , 19 , from @entity91 , a first year @entity142 student studying @entity10 and @entity143 , said : ' i was only 13 at the time of the murder but i remember it very well			1
@entity6 was only a few years older than me when she died			0
' i was a bit apprehensive at first but i 'm in a safe part of the city and it is so beautiful here			0
this is a fantastic opportunity and i 'm looking forward to it			0
i met @entity12 and she was very supportive and very glad to be back for a more happier event			0
' the two month scholarship will cover fees and accommodation costs for @entity20 and will be awarded yearly though applications to the @entity10 @entity160 in @entity91			2
