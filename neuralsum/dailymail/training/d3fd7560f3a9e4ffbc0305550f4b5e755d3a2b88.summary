teenagers will study @entity2 kingdoms and the rise of @entity4 as part of a new history a-level aimed at broadening lessons beyond ' @entity8 and the @entity9 '			1
examiners yesterday proposed a range of extra topics to be added to history a-levels under @entity15 reforms aimed at making public exams more rigorous			2
they include the rise of the @entity4 between 550 and 750 , @entity2 kingdoms between 1400 and 1800 , @entity20 , the @entity21 , @entity23 rulers from 1839 to 1989 and the @entity24 in @entity25			1
the new syllabus has been drawn up in response to complaints that school history has been dominated by the @entity30 and the @entity31			2

but the changes may prove controversial among those who advocate a strong focus on @entity46 history			1
mr @entity37 himself has stressed the importance of teaching @entity46 history , declaring in the @entity50 history lessons must ensure ' we can celebrate the distinguished role of these islands in the history of the world , from the role of the @entity57 in putting down the slave trade , to the way in which , since 1688 , this nation has been a beacon for liberty that others have sought to emulate '			1
another subject that could be taught is the @entity24 in @entity25			1

the planned new history @entity79 will also include new @entity46 history topics including a study of @entity82 and ' the making of @entity84 871 to 1016 '			1
@entity46 history will account for 25 per cent of the marks in the new qualification - the same proportion as currently			1
professor @entity88 , president of the @entity89 , said it was important to broaden school history			2
' the aspect of recent reforms to @entity94 and a-level most widely greeted with approval by academic historians has been the push to broaden the curriculum beyond the 20th century , ' he said			0
' history tells us not so much about who we are as about who we have been and what we might yet be			0
we welcome efforts by the examination boards to bring recent academic research on hitherto under - explored histories within reach of school pupils			0
' it is particularly important not to tell the history of the @entity114 world solely through its contact with the @entity114			0
' the new a-level â€“ which will need to be submitted to exams watchdog @entity117 for approval - will be first taught in schools in september 2015			0
leading universities have been overseeing the development of syllabuses and recommended that a 200 - year sweep of history is studied instead of 100			0
@entity70 said its course would cover about 1,700 years			0
some educators feel the syllabus is too focused on 20th century developments in the @entity114			0

@entity139 , @entity140 , commented : ' school history has been criticised , sometimes unfairly , for being too repetitive and for having a 20th century , @entity114 focus			0
' @entity8 and the @entity9 can dominate			0
universities tell us they want incoming students to have greater breadth of knowledge			0
it 's vital that schools and colleges have an opportunity to deliver , for example , the history of pre-colonial , non-western civilisations , alongside @entity46 history			1
' @entity70 's new @entity157 1400 - 1800 topic for example , developed with help from experts in higher education , will give students , for the first time , the chance to discover the economic and political power of four pre-colonial kingdoms , which had far - reaching global trade and diplomatic connections			2

the history of a wider range of countries will be taught under new plans
@entity20 , @entity25 's @entity24 and @entity2 kingdoms among them
but @entity46 history will still comprise a quarter of exam marks
