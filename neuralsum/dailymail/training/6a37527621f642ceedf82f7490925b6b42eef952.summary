and a nearby hotel , with rooms ranging in price from $ 225 to $ 345 per night , has rented more than 75 rooms for @entity19 agents , @entity21 officers and members of the presidential entourage			1
the hotel rooms alone will cost between $ 135,000 and $ 207,000			1
it 's unknown how much the home rental for the president 's family and their closest friends will set the @entity31 back			0

the @entity40 , a $ 7.6 million palace owned by financier @entity42 , will host the @entity31 duing their august vacation on @entity10 roughing it : the @entity32 chef will have his hands full with this state - of - the - art kitchen			1
the @entity31 will pay for the food , but not for the wages of the cooking and serving staff @entity52 built the home in 2006			2
first class all the way , but it 's a step down from the $ 21 million home the @entity0 's are accustomed to renting for their @entity57 vacations the most expensive published rental rates on the island run between $ 30,000 and $ 35,000 per week			1
a property expert in the town of @entity63 told @entity64 that the @entity31 ' chosen property , owned by financier @entity66 , would ' likely run in the $ 40,000 to $ 60,000 range for the eight - day stay			1
' ' i wish i had the commission on that , ' said the rental agent , who asked not to be identified			0
the $ 21 million home the @entity31 rented for their 2011 vacation on @entity10 cost an estimated $ 50,000 per week			1
their personal costs , though , will pale in comparison to the taxpayers ' portion of the expenses			1
@entity19 protection , location pre-screening , @entity32 staff pay , operation of @entity84 , the hotel accommodations for government employees and many other budget items will likely top $ 2 million			1
entourage and @entity19 protection ? if this 2009 trip to ' @entity10 ' is any indication , the trip will cost $ 2 million or more the home ' sits on nine and a half acres ' and includes ' a low group of buildings connected by porches , terraces , and patios , ' according to the architects huge complex : this aerial shot shows the @entity10 mansion owned by financier @entity66 that the @entity31 will rent if past vacations are any guide , those expenditures will also include @entity109 ships off the @entity111 coast , a motorcade of more than 20 cars , specialized ' war wagon ' suvs flown on military aircraft for the @entity31 ' use , @entity84 alone costs the government $ 180,000 per hour to operate and staff			1
the @entity31 are only required to reimburse the @entity120 for the cost of a comparable commercial fare			2
news organizations follow the same guidelines when sending reporters on the specially outfitted aircraft			0
in a 2011 interview with @entity129 , former @entity32 press secretary @entity127 defended the costs related to a massive presidential vacation delegation			2
' remember [ president ] @entity133 's trip to @entity10 in august 1998 when we ended up trying to decapitate @entity135 with a cruise missile strike ? ' @entity127 recalled			0
' that 's why the " entourage " has to accommodate all aspects of the presidency , even on vacation			2
you never know what might happen			0
august always produces the unexpected			0
' @entity144 , written by former @entity32 correspondent @entity145 , estimated in january that the @entity31 ' vacations in @entity147 since 2009 have cost a collective $ 20 million			1
fore ! president @entity0 will likely take some time to brush up on his golf game , as he did during his family 's 2010 @entity10 vacation			2
@entity152 fees are @entity0 's responsibility , but taxpayers will cover the @entity19 protection the @entity156 , a newspaper on @entity10 , first reported on july 17 that the @entity31 had settled on @entity42 's property for their holiday			0
@entity159 , which designed the home in 2006 , writes that it ' sits on nine and a half acres ' and includes ' a low group of buildings connected by porches , terraces , and patios			0
' ' the choice of materials reflect both a modern sensibility and the architectural traditions of the @entity173 in general and the island in particular , with gray - toned wood shingles , metal , stone , and concrete in evidence			0
' a huge glacial erratic , or boulder dropped by an ancient retreating glacier , was left in place , ' the architects write , ' and now rests near the front entrance â€” a marker to guide visitors into the welcoming compound and further ground the home in its natural surroundings			0
