researchers found feathers on prehistoric dinosaurs , which later evolved into birds , were arranged in multiple layers to act as insulation and preserve heat			1
the study from the universities of @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 found that prehistoric birds had a very primitive version of wings , and it was not until millions of years later that they began to evolve for display and camouflage , and then finally to allow the dinosaurs to fly			1
instead of flexible , aerodynamic feathers the creatures had rigid layers which acted as simple airfoils and could be used for limited gliding			2
but over millions of years natural selection modified these into highly - effective feathered wings which could rapidly change their span , shape and area			2
dr @entity47 , from the schools of @entity44 and @entity45 at the @entity46 , said the research showed an intricate picture of how feathers and birds evolved			2
he said : ' we are starting to get an intricate picture of how feathers and birds evolved from within the dinosaurs			2
' we now seem to see that feathers evolved initially for insulation			0
' later in evolution , more complex vaned or pinnate feathers evolved for display			0
' these display feathers turned out to be excellent membranes that could have been utilised for aerial locomotion , which only very late in bird evolution became what we consider flapping flight			0
' this new research is shedding light not just on how birds came to fly , but more specifically on how feathers came to be the way they are today - one of the most amazing and highly specialised structures in nature			0
' the research , published in the journal @entity77 , looked at two different pre-historic species , the @entity79 huxleyi a dinosaur , and the @entity81 , a @entity82 bird , thought to be 155 million years old			0
plumage : an artist 's impression of the feathered ornithomimid dinosaurs found in @entity86 , @entity87 both species involved a combination of dinosaur and bird characteristics and allowed the scientists to investigate their feathers			0
they found that the wings differed greatly from modern day birds and were composed of multiple layers of long feathers			1
the individual feathers were relatively weak due to slender shafts , the layering is likely to have produced a strong airfoil , early experiments in the evolution of the wing			0
but the study revealed however the inability of pre-historic birds to separate their feathers suggested that taking off and flying at low speeds may have been limited			1
instead scientists suggested that the wings were primarily used in insulation , or when needed in high - speed gliding or flapping flight.the research also found that once the feathers had evolved by natural selection the basic wing configuration remained almost the same for 130 million years			1
as the role of aerodynamics and the mechanics of flight becoming more apparent , birds developed wings which included a layer of long , asymmetrical flight feathers with short covert feathers on top			1
this meant they were able to separate and rotate them to gain height , change direction and even hover			0
dr @entity133 of @entity23 added : ' by studying fossils carefully , we are now able to start piecing together how the wing evolved			1
' before , it seemed that we had more or less modern wings from the @entity82 onwards			0
' now it â€™s clear that early birds were more primitive and represented transitional forms linking birds to dinosaurs			1
' we can see the wing slowly becoming more advanced as we move from @entity79 , to @entity81 , to later birds			0
