by @entity0 published : 09:50 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 06:44 est , 27 june 2012 embarrassed : dr @entity1 spoke of his ' deep regret ' over the affair at the hearing a respected family doctor who lost his job after he had a two year extra marital affair with a patient told of his shame , embarrassment and ' deep regret ' at the fling today			1
married gp dr @entity13 , 58 , swapped sexual texts with the woman and conducted the secret affair at his surgery after his colleagues had gone home for the day			1
the woman , 50 , who was also a health care assistant at the medical practise was said to have ' disposition , sensibility and was in control of her life			1
' but the illicit romance ended after @entity13 ’s wife looked at his mobile phone and discovered the flirtatious texts between him and his mistress			1
@entity13 was a called to meeting by his three fellow partners at the @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 where he admitted the affair and later resigned			1
' today he apologised ' most humbly ' for the affair as he faced a @entity40 ( @entity40 ) fitness to practise hearing in @entity42 where he faces being struck off for misconduct			1
' he admits the affair was improper but denies using his professional position as a doctor in order to secure a relationship with patient a claiming he regarded his mistress as a work colleague			1
' i am appalled by my behaviour at the time , ' said the doctor			2
' i have asked myself thousands of times how i managed to get myself into the position and how a well - respected gp , with a good character finds his career collapsing around himself over such a fundamental breach of the sort of trust and honour that goes with my position			1
' earlier the hearing was told @entity13 , who joined the practice in 1984 , met his mistress whilst she was working at the surgery			1
she was also @entity13 ’s patient at the practise and had been to six appointments with the doctor during the affair after suffering a shoulder complaint			1
each appointment with the woman - known only as @entity73 should have lasted no longer than 10 minutes			2
but the hearing was told the appointments appeared to be not only at the end of surgery but on two occasions they over-ran - one by 57 minutes and another by 18 minutes			2
@entity13 was a called to meeting by his three fellow partners at the @entity35 in @entity81 , @entity37 ( pictured ) where he admitted the affair a distressed @entity13 eventually confided in another partner at the practice about the relationship with patient a in january 2011 after his wife discovered a text message on his phone which gave the relationship away			1
it emerged the texts had began as early as 2008			0
when asked if he admitted the relationship with patient a , @entity13 said : ' sadly and with deep regret , yes			1
she had disposition , sensibility , aged about 50 , and in control of her life , that ’s what i would probably say			0
' she was an extremely good employee , good at her job , with attention to detail , a good sickness record and was not in any way prone to sickness at all			0
' i think i was feeling slightly ignored at home			0
i can not tell you how the first text happened , it just sort of developed			0
i honestly could n’t tell you who sent the first text			0
there were certainly some texts of a sexual nature			0
' he said the sexual relationship did n’t start until march 2010 when @entity73 ran smoking cessation advice sessions and he was on a rota working extended hours			0
@entity13 continued : ' our working life together presented us with the opportunity to have a sexual relationship once the surgery was closed for business and the secretaries had gone home for the day			1
' i am embarrassed to say this but it is important that i acknowledge that that was the situation that developed			0
' he said the pair had not struck up a sexual relationship before @entity73 visited him for an appointment about her shoulder on october , 15 , 2009			0
@entity13 said there was no sexual contact between the two during appointments and when asked about the lengthy appointments , he suggested the computer must have been set to log off after a failure to shut down			1
speaking of the sexual encounters , dr @entity13 added : ' they were after the extended hours , when the building was empty - around 8.30 or 8.45pm , something like that			1
' the affair developed between patient a and myself because we worked together - had patient @entity73 not worked in the surgery , the affair would have never developed			2
' he also said the affair would have happened , even if patient a registered with another practice - because they still worked together			2
' it is my great shame that i ’m here now because of that , ' he added			2
' i should have never started any kind of sexual relationship with her , it was inappropriate on all sorts of levels			0
' it was only when my inappropriate behaviour was discovered that i actually came to realise what i had been doing , for which i apologise most humbly			0
' ' it was based on two people working together , but that does n’t excuse it			0
i now accept that i crossed the boundary			0
' it developed because we worked together as work colleagues and there was no real link in my mind or her that the relationship developed because she was a patient			2
' i did n’t give it the significance that it obviously should have had '			0
the hearing was told on january 18 , 2011 a meeting was set up between @entity13 and the other three partners where he admitted everything and was suspended as a result			1
counsel to the @entity199 @entity198 said : ' he admitted to his colleagues and partners that he had a relationship with her and had admitted that the sexual liaisons had taken place in the surgery premises			2
' @entity73 did not give evidence at the hearing but submitted a letter to the surgery confirming that the relationship had taken place over a two year period			0
she said : ' i was very aware that what we were doing was wrong			0
i have deeply hurt my family and let down my work colleges			2
it ’s something i have to live with , i only hope in time that they will forgive me			0
' the hearing was told the woman ’s medical appointments with @entity13 had been set late in the day as they would fit in better with her 9 - 6pm working patterns			1
@entity13 ’s lawyer @entity225 , defending , said : ' it ’s admitted that in relation to patient @entity73 , doctor @entity13 engaged in an improper emotional and sexual relationship , but it is not admitted that he abused his professional position			1
' the hearing continues .			0
