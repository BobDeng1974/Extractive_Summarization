but when the first batch did not achieve the desired effect , they decided to pump a second dose into his body , assistant attorney general @entity16 told @entity21			0
even so , state corrections officials pushed back against any suggestion the procedure was botched , saying @entity1 was fully sedated and never felt any pain			1

just after declaring that he was at peace with his death , he smiled at the deacon , but for a second , a subtle look of panic took over his face			0
protest : there are growing calls in the @entity217 for the death penalty to be repealed officials administered the lethal drugs at 1:52 p.m. @entity1 's eyes closed			1
about 10 minutes later , the gasping began			0
@entity1 's jaw dropped , his chest expanded , and he let out a gasp			2

they went on and on , hundreds of times			0
an administrator checked on him a half - dozen times			0

still , she said , there was nothing unlawful about the death			0
she said : ' one thing is certain , however , inmate @entity1 died in a lawful manner and by eyewitness and medical accounts he did not suffer			0
going forward : a fence surrounds the state prison in @entity30 , @entity5 where the execution of @entity285 was scheduled to take place on wednesday ' this is in stark comparison to the gruesome , vicious suffering that he inflicted on his two victims — and the lifetime of suffering he has caused their family			1
' after the death , a federal judge ordered officials to preserve all physical evidence in @entity1 's execution for an investigation			1
the lengthy execution quickly re-ignited the death penalty debate as critics denounced it as cruel and unusual punishment and said it raised grave questions about the two - drug combination @entity5 uses for lethal injections			1
