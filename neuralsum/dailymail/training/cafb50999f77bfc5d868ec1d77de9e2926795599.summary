it ’s the vegetable that kids the length and breadth of the country do their best to avoid on christmas day , so they ’re bound to approve of sprouts being served up as an alternative power source for tree lights instead of being served up on their dinner plates			1
one thousand of the raw vegetables have been used by scientists from @entity14 @entity13 @entity12 and @entity15 to create the unusual battery for the decorations			1
it is the world ’s first christmas tree to be powered by these vegetables and it ’s been placed on @entity23 ’s @entity22 area – a sight that ’ll give sprout - haters everywhere a warm glow			1
way to glow : the eight - foot christmas tree is on display on the @entity22 in @entity23 with the lights powered by 1,000 @entity33 sprouts the grand unveiling ceremony took place on tuesday morning , with pupils from the @entity37 flicking the switch			1
the battery for the eight - foot tree was created using five power cells , each holding 200 sprouts , producing 63 volts from the 1,000 @entity33 sprouts			1
this comes into the ' extra-low voltage ' category – like a telephone – and is safe to touch			0
switched - on kids : pupils from @entity37 turned on the lights green energy : the battery was created using five power cells , each holding 200 sprouts essentially the battery works like electrolysis			1
copper and @entity56 electrodes are placed in each @entity33 sprout to create a chemical reaction between the electrodes using the acid in the sprout - generating a current which can be stored and used to power the leds on the tree			1
the battery was created using five power cells , each holding 200 sprouts			2
these in turn produce 63 volts from the 1,000 @entity33 sprouts			1
the power is stored in a capacitor and released through 100 high efficiency leds			0
the @entity14 scientists are able to monitor the voltage on a separate display , which shows how much energy is being produced by the sprouts			1
the battery will last for as long as the sprouts stay fresh			2

@entity88 , director of prototyping at @entity91 - based @entity90 , which made the installation , explained that how long the battery lasts depends on how long the sprouts stay fresh			2
he said : ' they will keep generating a current for as long as the vegetables stay fresh , and not decomposed			0
as long as they 're fresh they will keep providing the electrolytes for the chemical reaction that generates the current			0
' the sprouts powering this tree should last a month , but more can always be added if it runs out of juice			2
in theory , he explained , any fruit or vegetable could be used to power the lights , but sprouts are actually the least efficient			0
he added : ' sprouts are probably the worst vegetables to use , which makes the feat even more amazing			0
the more moist and fluid , the better they are at conducting electricity			0
' @entity118 , the ceo of @entity119 , which runs @entity14 @entity13 @entity120 , said : ‘ we want young people to think about @entity124 subjects in an interesting way and are always looking for different ways to do that			2
' it being the festive time of year – and kids ’ dislike of sprouts being well documented – using them to create a battery seemed like a unique way to achieve that aim			0
‘ every year thousands of pupils and teachers attend the @entity15 , which exists to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers			0
' we want to extend the buzz of the @entity15 further and wider , so that even those who ca n’t attend are encouraged to consider careers in science , technology , engineering and maths			0

the eight - foot tree is on @entity22 in @entity23 and was lit up on tuesday
the battery that powers its lights is made from 1,000 @entity33 sprouts
the *invention* was cooked up by scientists from the @entity13 *'s* @entity14 fair
the @entity*16*0 takes place at the @entity*16*2 , @entity*16*3 , on 13 - *16* march 2014 . to register or for more *information* visit @entity*16*5 .
