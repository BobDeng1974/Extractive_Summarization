by @entity1 reporter if he helps @entity2 to an unlikely victory at the @entity4 in @entity5 , he ’ll be hailed a hero			0
but even then @entity8 star @entity7 might struggle to mend fences with his neighbours			0
for the @entity12 midfielder has angered locals by illegally building a £ 40,000 all - weather football court in his back garden			1
the 26 - year - old married his long - term partner @entity33 in december and they have a son , @entity35 , who is almost two years old			2
but neighbours are worried that it will be used for noisy matches in a designated @entity39			0
the row began when @entity7 – who is in @entity41 as @entity2 prepare for tonight ’s warm - up match against @entity43 – submitted a planning application in december seeking retrospective permission for a separate children ’s wooden play area in his garden			1
in this application , his planning agent said he also planned a ‘ small @entity27 pitch ’			2
family : @entity7 , 26 , is married his long - term partner @entity33 ( pictured )			1
he planned to use the astro turf pitch for ' kickabouts ' with his young family			2
the pitch cost between £ 40,000 and £ 60,000 to build the footballer is pictured with his young son @entity35			0
he is currently in @entity41 with the @entity2 squad @entity60 , who lives next door to the £ 1.5million , five - bedroom house near @entity63 , @entity64 , said what was built was more like a large council leisure facility			1
mr @entity60 , who has lived with his wife @entity67 at their home for more than 20 years , said : ‘ we did n’t object to the application , why would we ? we understand kids need somewhere to play			2
‘ but then we saw builders and welders arrive on site and we could n’t work out what was going on			0
we saw this sports pitch being built and we just could n’t believe it			0
‘ the council enforcement officer told us it was more in keeping with a council play park than a garden in a @entity82 , which this is			0
’ neighbour : @entity60 , who lives next door to mr @entity7 ’s £ 1.5 million five bedroom house said he is concerned about the prospect of noisy sports matches planning officials found the height of the games area – and in particular the basketball hoops and backboards – was beyond permitted development rules and required planning consent			1
@entity7 , who earns about £ 50,000 a week but has been linked with a big - money move to @entity95 this summer , will either have to adjust the dimensions of the games area or submit a retrospective application for consideration			1
@entity100 , a planning consultant acting for @entity7 , said : ‘ the area of hard standing to be used as a knock - about pitch has been agreed by @entity104 as “ permitted development ” and does not need planning permission			1
‘ over the small goal areas , fencing has been raised to support a basketball hoop			0
technically that part needs planning permission as it is more than two metres in height			1

@entity12 player planned to use pitch for ' knockabouts ' with his family
but the construction has been built without proper planning permission
the midfielder must now apply for retrospective planning permission
if that fails he may have to *demolish* pitch - which is also a basketball court
