@entity1 manager @entity0 says he is ready to unleash @entity2 on @entity3 â€“ even though the teenager played 95 minutes against @entity5 on sunday			1
@entity0 has rejected claims that @entity2 said he was ' tired ' while on @entity8 duty although he has talked himself about the dangers of burn - out facing the 19 - year - old			1
@entity2 certainly looked fresh when he embarked on the injury - time run that set up @entity1 's goal in a 3 - 2 win at @entity15 and @entity0 is confident he can show the same verve and energy on wednesday night despite having only 72 hours to recover			1
' he was a real catalyst but it was no surprise to see him at that level			0
' he showed wonderful speed , technique and , of course , hard work			0
so there is no doubt he can arrive into this game ( v @entity3 ) like he 's done since i 've been here			1
' @entity0 has had to regularly field questions about why @entity1 have fallen short of last season 's standards when they ran @entity44 close to winning the @entity45			1
a big turnaround in personnel over the summer has created inconsistent results and in the @entity51 a home win against @entity50 was followed by a disappointing 1 - 0 loss in @entity53			2
@entity0 ( second right ) addresses the media ahead of his side 's crucial @entity51 game this week the @entity1 manager believes that @entity2 ( pictured ) will be fine to play , rubbishing claims he is tired @entity59 feels the arrvial of @entity61 could inspire his players			1
' we understand it is a very important game for us and obviously a great challenge , ' he said			0
' this group really lift ourselves for the big games			2
' we have n't got to the levels of last season but this is a special game in a special competition			0
but knowing the competitors we have in our team , i am confident we will rise to the challenge of @entity3			1
' it is still going to be a difficult game			0
they are a squad of top - class players			1
of course @entity85 is arguably the best in the world , his evolution from a soloist who scored goals to a goalscorer has been impressive			0
' but we need to have a plan for our team first to cause them problems , and then work out a way of stoppoing them , as a team			0
' @entity3 are the visitors to @entity93 on wednesday , in a @entity95 match there were claims that @entity2 told @entity8 manager @entity98 he was tired while on international duty @entity101 @entity1 host real in @entity20 epic on @entity104 's injury , @entity0 added : ' he is a world - class player , he 's got fantastic speed so of course if he is not playing it can be an advantage			1
but their squad is fantastic , they can bring players like @entity111 so the advantage is n't significant and certainly they will test us in the game			2
' for us , although it is a difficult tie for us and we are n't playing as well as we have done , people have n't focussed on our character and spirit and it 's that which is allowing us to win games			2
' we need that on wednesday to go with quality of our football to take another step to qulaifying from the group			0
' captain @entity127 called on the team to improve from their win at @entity5 if they want to trouble @entity3			1
and on tuesday night at the official pre-match @entity51 press conference , he explained : ' we have been a bit up and down , in a bit of a stuttering season			2
everyone is well aware we have lost a phenomenal player in @entity139 and struggled getting @entity140 on the field , so it is only natural we would have teething problems			0
' but i have huge confidence in these players we can get back to the level we had last season			0
it wo n't be very long			0
