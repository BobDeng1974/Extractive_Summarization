a @entity1 school district has banned a football team t - shirt with the slogan ' shhhhhhh just let it happen ' after questions over whether the message could also have a rape innuendo			1
the issue came up after @entity10 's bi-monthly newspaper raised concerns about the shirt in a staff editorial			1
the shirt was designed by senior football team members and printed by the football booster club			1
it reads ' @entity17 ' in big gray letters above an image of a @entity21 man that represents the school 's warrior mascot			2
to the left of the man is a pirate flag , with a skull and crossbones , along with the words ' we take what we want , ' and below the flag is the phrase ' shhhhhhh just let it happen			2
' the editorial read : ' the shirt 's main message is to state the player 's idea that there is no need for the opponent to put up a fight in letting our team take the ball away from them ' can this saying be easily misunderstood ? yes			2
though it certainly was not the goal of the shirt , its slogan connotes rape culture			1
this is not what we want to display as a slogan for our @entity87 football program , ' the editorial reads			0
the @entity36 's editor - in - chief @entity34 , 18 , a @entity37 senior , told @entity89 5 that the paper 's staff was motivated to write its editorial after a female student approached a news staff member with concerns over the t - shirt			1

school sensitivities : how the article appeared in the @entity36 - the school newspaper growing population : 280 children go to school at the @entity10 in @entity110 , @entity1 ' it 's inappropriate , and it 's not something that you want to represent the @entity115 with , ' @entity34 said			1
the coach of the team , @entity96 , said that they did not consider the shirt to be inappropriate or offensive in any way adding that they would never have allowed it to be made or worn			0
he said it referred to ' the act of piracy , taking what you want			0
what we want is the football '			0
school district spokeswoman @entity132 said that officials believed the team had not intended to be offensive but that the t - shirts had been banned			1
' certainly the booster club and the coaches , nobody construed it in that manner , ' said @entity132 , director of communications for @entity141 , who estimates that around 50 of the shirts were printed			0
' they were never intended or thought to have any meaning other than a football - related meaning â€” taking yardage , the ball			2
' ' they just thought it was a football shirt			0
and when that was pointed out , that it could be taken in that way the students have , they are no longer wearing them			0
