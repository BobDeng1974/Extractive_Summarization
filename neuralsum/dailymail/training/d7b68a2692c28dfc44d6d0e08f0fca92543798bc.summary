a pilot 's ambitious plan to fly around the world using just solar energy took a step closer this week			1
@entity5 took off from @entity6 and completed the first test flight of his @entity8 2 plane ahead of next month 's 22,000 - mile trip			1
during the 12 - hour flight he soared over the @entity12 , the @entity14 skyscraper and @entity15			1
during the flight he soared over the @entity12 ( pictured ) , the @entity14 skyscraper and @entity15 the single - seater airplane has been designed to fly day and night without a drop of fuel and mr @entity5 - along with fellow founder and pilot @entity5 - will attempt the global trip within weeks			1
they will depart from @entity6 before flying over the @entity26 , to @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , then across the @entity30			1
the solar - powered airplane made its maiden flight in @entity17 in june last year			1
the single - seater aircraft is made of carbon fibre			0
it has no fuel on board and weighs around the same as a car at 382 stone ( 2,300kg )			0
with a wingspan of 236 ft ( 72 metres ) , it is larger than a @entity44 747 - @entity43 jet liner			2
the 17,000 solar cells built into the wings supply four electric motors ( 17.5 cv each ) with renewable energy			1
during the day , the solar cells recharge lithium batteries weighing 2,077lbs ( 633 kg ) which allow the aircraft to fly at night and therefore to have virtually unlimited autonomy			2
from there they will stop over in the @entity57 , travel over the @entity58 to @entity59 or @entity60 before finishing the journey by returning to the initial departure point			2
the groundbreaking 22,000 - mile ( 35,000km ) trip , is expected to take five months			1
the engines of the plane - which has a wingspan of 236ft ( 72 metres ) - will be powered solely by solar energy			1

during the day , the solar cells recharge lithium batteries weighing 2,077lbs ( 633 kg ) which allow the aircraft to fly at night and therefore to have virtually unlimited autonomy			2
the @entity17 pilots will take turns at the controls in the tiny cabin for five consecutive days and nights in the air			1
this will equate to approximately 25 flight days at speeds between 30 and 60 miles per hour ( 50 and 100 kph )			0

the groundbreaking 22,000 - mile ( 35,000km ) trip , is expected to take five months and include 25 flight days @entity8 2 's round - the - world journey will begin in @entity6 with stopovers in @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , before crossing the @entity30 and flying across the @entity57 and southern @entity59 to complete its journey where it started			1
the route is illustrated in this graphic to break up flying day and night , @entity96 will stop in 12 locations around the world it will take off in @entity6 , capital of the @entity100 in early march before stopping off in @entity101 in @entity102 and @entity103 and @entity104 in @entity27			2
from there , it will fly to @entity107 , @entity28 , before making two pit stops in @entity29 at @entity109 and @entity110			2
the solar - powered plane will then cross the @entity30 via @entity112			1

during the day , the solar cells recharge lithium batteries weighing 2,077lbs ( 633 kg ) which allow the aircraft ( pictured ) to fly at night and therefore to have virtually unlimited autonomy a pit - stop in the south west of the @entity57 will be chosen depending on weather conditions , before the @entity8 2 stops off at @entity128 and at @entity129 in @entity130			1
after crossing the @entity58 , it will make a stop somewhere in southern @entity59 , before undertaking the final leg of its journal to land in @entity6			2
the plane has a wingspan equal to that of the largest passenger airliner , but weighs the same as a family car at 5,100 lbs ( 2,300kg )			0

feasibility studies , design and construction have taken 12years , said mr @entity5 : ' miracles can be achieved with renewables such as solar power			0
the two pilots , together with a crew of 80 technicians , engineers and a communications team have been in @entity6 for a fortnight and will conduct safety tests , test flights , and training to prepare for the mission ahead			2
during stopovers , people will be able to visit the airplane and @entity165 will be hosted to break up flying day and night , @entity96 will stop in 12 locations around the world it will take off in @entity6 , capital of the @entity100 in late february or early march			0
it will then stop in @entity101 in @entity102 and @entity103 and @entity104 in @entity27			0

' it is not the first solar airplane , however it is the first able to cross oceans and continents , ' he said			0
mr @entity5 said that the scale of the challenge is unknown			0
' it is a question of technical reliability , of human weather and it is the challenge of discovery , ' he said , before adding that if something goes wrong , the team will build another aircraft and continue the journey			0
