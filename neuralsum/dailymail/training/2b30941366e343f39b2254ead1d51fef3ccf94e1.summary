@entity1 's men celebrate 1 - 0 victory in @entity3 @entity4 on target with match winner on 37 minutes @entity7 steals the show with @entity10 performance @entity11 rounded off their @entity13 tour in the early hours of thursday morning with their third win out of four matches in @entity16 and @entity3			1
while their penultimate match , an uninspiring 2 - 1 win over @entity20 on @entity21 , had @entity1 lamenting his young second string ’s display , out here in the @entity3 capital another kid served yet more notice that he is indeed the real deal			1
midfielder @entity28 was simply sensational against @entity29 , showing he is back to his best and fully over the virus that attacked his internal organs and ruled him out for the second half of last season			2
on target : @entity4 scored the winning goal for @entity11 on 37 minutes @entity11 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity36 ( @entity37 46 ) ; @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ; @entity41 , @entity28 , @entity42 ( @entity43 73 ) , @entity4 , @entity44 ( @entity45 78 ) ; @entity46 , @entity47 ( @entity48 78 )			1
subs not used : @entity51 , @entity50 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55			2
goals : law ( 37 )			1
@entity28 spoke eloquently earlier this week about fearing his career was over but on this form he could go right to the very top of the game			2
the highlight of his excellent performance came midway through the first half when he set up @entity4 ’s only goal of the game with a neat pirouette move that could have come straight out of the @entity69 playbook			1
overall , this was far more like it from @entity1 ’s men , after some stuttering performances out here against @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity20			1
perhaps it helped that not only were @entity29 the best calibre of opposition @entity11 have faced , this match was played out in a venue ideally suited for football , the impressive td place stadium			2
happy days : @entity1 was pleased to see his side sign off from their pre-season tour with a win tight contest : @entity11 star @entity28 is confronted by @entity88 's @entity87 ( left ) and @entity89 ( right ) it compared favourably with the spectacular fairground setting @entity11 played in against @entity92 , and the low - key university campus fields that hosted @entity75 and @entity20			1
and with a better standard of opposition , there was a lot more bite to this encounter			0
@entity29 , a team in the second tier of @entity103 soccer pyramid , below @entity104 , were captained by the former @entity106 midfielder @entity105			0
on their bench was @entity109 , a 29 - year - old @entity110 , who played with @entity111 before quitting his homeland in 2005 to go to the @entity113 in @entity114			2
with @entity117 and @entity118 out injured , the lack of a fit right - back saw @entity1 go to a three at the back			1
captain @entity39 was placed between @entity38 and @entity40			0
the central midfield three were @entity42 , @entity28 and @entity121 , with @entity41 and @entity44 on either flank			0
@entity47 and @entity46 were the front pairing			0
the first noteworthy action of the first half action came when @entity28 ’s corner was headed against the bar by @entity39			0
then @entity29 ’s @entity89 crunched into @entity42 with unnecessary force , earning a yellow card and prompting anger amongst the @entity11 players			0
off target : @entity47 was unable to get on the scoresheet during @entity11 ' latest match @entity46 was chasing his first goal of the tour and should have scored but he failed to make a proper connection on @entity28 ’s fine ball across goal			1
@entity28 was at the centre of every @entity11 move of note and it was no surprise it was his sublime skill that set up law to crack home superbly from 15 yards			0
@entity29 had a great chance of their own to level when @entity149 clearly fouled @entity38 before running through on substitute keeper @entity37 , only to crack his shot past the far post			0
an apoplectic @entity38 had to be stopped by his own teammates from complaining to referee @entity153 about the lack of a whistle			0
in the second half , @entity4 nearly grabbed a second after good work by @entity47 but the former @entity160 midfielder fired wide			1
then @entity11 should have had a penalty when @entity162 handled a header by @entity39			0
and there was another dodgy decision when an onside @entity46 was flagged offside after heading into the net a @entity42 ’s shot that spun up off @entity29 defender @entity162			0
that meant @entity46 drew a blank in four match out here , while @entity47 also failed to notch and he was replaced by @entity48 for the final 11 minutes			1
but @entity11 boss @entity1 will have been relatively pleased with what he saw here against @entity29			1
@entity11 jet home to @entity178 on friday , before the build - up to the new @entity175 season continues with a friendly against @entity180 at @entity181 on august 2			2
the new competitive campaign kicks off against @entity183 in the @entity184 three days later at @entity185 .			0
