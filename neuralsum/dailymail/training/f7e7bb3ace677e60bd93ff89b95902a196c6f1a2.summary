the 150ft , 130,000 ton chunk of space rock was the nearest flyby for an object of this size since records began			1
although scientists said there was little chance of asteroid 2012 @entity15 hitting our planet - if it did , it would have inflicted 1,000 times more damage than the atomic bomb dropped on @entity20			1
its closest approach , passing within 17,000 miles ( 27,357 kilometers ) , which is closer than some satellites , was at 7.25pm , @entity24 close shave : an asteroid capable of destroying @entity3 has successfully skimmed past the @entity4			1
this image , taken in @entity27 , shows the huge piece of space rock at it nears @entity4 frightening : the 150ft , 130,000 ton chunk of space rock was the nearest flyby for an object of this size since records began huge : this image shows how scientists think the asteroid looks the flyby occurred just hours after a much smaller meteor exploded above @entity43 's @entity42			1
astronomers say the two events were coincidental , and the objects were traveling in opposite directions			0
the asteroid delighted astronomers in @entity27 and elsewhere who watched it zip harmlessly through a clear night sky			0
' it 's on its way out , ' reported @entity54 of @entity55			0
the asteroid was too small to see with the naked eye even at its closest approach over the @entity59 near @entity60			0
the best viewing locations , with binoculars and telescopes , were in @entity64 , @entity27 and eastern @entity65			0
even there , all anyone could see was a pinpoint of light as the asteroid buzzed by at 17,400 mph ( 28,000 kph )			0
as asteroids go , this one was relatively small			0
the one that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago was 6 miles across			1
fast : this image shows the asteroid as it travels through the sky			0
it is the white dot in the middle of picture speedy : asteroid 2012 @entity15 shoots through the night sky as it passes by closely to @entity4 in @entity85 , @entity86 but this rock could still do immense damage if it ever struck given its 143,000 - ton heft , releasing the energy equivalent of 2.4 million tons of @entity91 and wiping out 750 square miles			1
by comparison , @entity55 estimated that the meteor that exploded over @entity43 was much smaller - about 49 feet ( 15 meters ) wide and 7,000 tons before it hit the atmosphere , or one - third the size of the passing asteroid			1
speaking about the back - to - back events , @entity97 , @entity55 's director of planetary science , said : ' this is indeed very rare and it is historic			2
' these fireballs happen about once a day or so , but we just do n't see them because many of them fall over the ocean or in remote areas			0
this one was an exception			0
' close : this @entity55 graphic shows the trajectory of the asteroid			0
the green line shows the moment it reached its closest point to @entity4 , at about 7.25pm @entity117 time @entity118 , an amateur astronomer in @entity120 , @entity27 , captured the asteroid - seen here as the black line as it moves across the sky / the three minute exposure shows the fast movement of asteroid 2012 da14 seven hours before closest approach			1
at its closest approach , the object will be moving so fast as to cover this distance in approximately 15 seconds			0
disaster : this graphic shows the sequence of events which led to a meteor crashing in @entity43 yesterday the asteroid was invisible to astronomers in the @entity137 at the time of its closest approach on the opposite of the world			1
but in @entity27 , astronomers used binoculars and telescopes to watch the point of light speed across the clear night sky			0
the asteroid cut through the orbit of some satellites used for weather forecasting and for satellite phones and television			2
this afternoon it was spotted by amateur astronomer @entity118 in , @entity120 , @entity27			0
asteroid 2012 @entity15 is seen as a streak running almost vertically at centre of the image			0
close shave : asteroid 2012 @entity15 will pass just 17,100 miles from @entity4 at around 7.30pm			1
' in astronomical terms , that 's very close , ' said astronomer and asteroid expert @entity160 of @entity162 it is a three - minute min exposure , with the asteroid seen at -82.5 degrees and heading south			2
the streak is quite regular - indicating no major brightness variations over a time scale of three minutes			2
at closest approach , the object was moving so fast as to cover this distance in approximately 15 seconds			0
@entity171 , manager of @entity55 's @entity172 at the @entity173 , has insisted : ' no @entity4 impact is possible			1
' a few hundred satellites orbit at 22,300 miles , higher than the asteroid 's path , but scientists say the chance of it hitting one is extremely remote			1
nevertheless , satellite operators have been warned however , he added , its journey through space will bring it so close to our planet that stargazers from @entity65 to @entity27 will be able to see it with just a pair of binoculars			2
' this flyby will provide a unique opportunity for researchers to study a near - @entity4 object up close			1
' the half - hour broadcast from the agency 's @entity173 in @entity199 , @entity200 , included a real - time animation to show the location of the asteroid in relation to @entity4			1
there were also live or near real - time views of the asteroid from observatories in @entity27			2
scientists have never observed such a narrow miss before			0
through binoculars , the object was visible as a tiny dot of light crossing the sky			0
it was recommended to look towards the north - east horizon around two hours after sunset			1
disturbance : this graphic depicts the trajectory of asteroid 2012 @entity15 as it flies past @entity4 tonight			1
this view looks down from above the @entity223 and shows how it will pass inside the ring of geo - stationary satellites ' it will be too faint for the naked eye but with binoculars it should be visible if you know where to look			1
it will be low to the north - eastern horizon and moving quite quickly , ' he said			2
' you ’ll be able to see it pass from the constellation @entity237 to roughly the @entity238 , more or less from anywhere in the @entity117 , and it will be bright for about an hour			0
' asteroid 2012 @entity15 belongs to dangerous family of near - earth objects ( @entity172 ) that are small enough to be missed but large enough to cause serious damage			2
it was discovered in february last year by @entity244 in southern @entity245 as it fell under the spotlight of the @entity248 ’s rays , and has been closely tracked ever since			0
travelling at between 12,427mph and 18,641mph the asteroid will fly inside the orbits of high geostationary satellites some 22,000 miles above the @entity4			1
these are the satellites that provide us with telecommunications and weather forecasts , ' said dr @entity160			2
' there are loads of them but you ’re talking about a very big area			0
it would be very unlucky if a satellite was hit			2
' the asteroid is more likely to hit some space junk , but most of this is only about a centimetre across and the impact wo n’t even be noticed			1
' the asteroid posed no danger to the @entity273 , which orbits at an altitude of only a few hundred kilometres			0
the 150ft - wide , 130,000 - ton asteroid is considered small as these things go			1
by contrast , the one that took out the dinosaurs 65million years ago was 6 miles wide			2
@entity282 calculations showed there was absolutely no possibility of @entity15 hitting the @entity4 , dr @entity160 said			1
but scientists had a good idea of what the effect of such an impact would be because a similar sized meteor devastated a remote region of @entity292 in 1908			2
exploding a short distance above the ground over @entity296 , the object generated a blast equivalent to 2.4million tons of @entity91			1
@entity298 was completely flattened over an area of 830 square miles			2
' we think the object that impacted at @entity296 would have been of a similar size to @entity15 , ' said dr @entity160			0
' actually , it exploded in the air			2
it did n’t destroy humanity , but if this object had exploded over @entity3 it would have wiped out @entity3			0
' it ’s not a global impact , but it ’s a severe impact			0
' the likelihood of something this size striking @entity4 is once in every 1,200 years ; a close encounter like this is thought to occur every 40 years			1
during the flypast , scientists will use radar to study @entity15 and learn about its composition and structure			0
the knowledge could prove useful if steps have to be taken to remove the threat of another space rock			1
the ' @entity323 option ' of blowing up an incoming asteroid has been ruled out by experts			0
such a dramatic solution would only result in deadly debris raining down on @entity4 so scientists are instead looking at ways of gently nudging an asteroid onto a safer trajectory			1
the bulk of the solar system 's asteroids are located between the orbits of @entity336 and @entity337 , and remain stable there for billions of years			0
some occasionally pop out , though , into @entity4 's neighbourhood .			1

the 130,000 ton chunk of space rock was its closed to @entity4 at 7.25pm , *gmt*
it passed within 17,000 miles - closer than some satellites
it would have exploded with the force of 2.4million tons of @entity91 if hit @entity4
the flyby occurred hours after a smaller meteor exploded above @entity43
