the swarms of insects that plague light bulbs at night could be about to become a thing of the past			1
scientists have invented a bulb that emits less blue and green wavelengths , which they claim is 20 per cent less appealing to moths and other bugs			1
the technology could also save lives in the tropical regions of the world , where insects carry a multitude of potentially fatal diseases			1
a bright idea : scientists claim they have invented a bulb that emits less blue and green wavelengths , which does n’t appeal to insects as much as conventional led light bulbs ( shown ) light emitted by conventional bulbs - particularly the blue wavelengths of led bulbs – is attractive to a range of insects , drawing them out from the night and straight to people ’s homes			1
the problem with this is that insects such as mosquitoes , sand flies and ‘ kissing bugs ’ that fly towards the light , increase the risk of catching vector - borne diseases			1
six million people worldwide , mostly in @entity42 , are infected with @entity44 disease , which is transmitted by ‘ kissing bugs ’ that are attracted to lights			2
sand flies infect people with a protozoan parasite responsible for 20,000 deaths annually , while mosquitoes , which are also drawn to the light , carry malaria which kills more than 600,000 people a year			2
light emitted by conventional bulbs - particularly the blue wavelengths of led bulbs – is attractive to a range of insects , drawing them out from the night and straight to people ’s homes			1
here , a vast number of bugs flock towards a floodlight in @entity63 graphene is set to make its commercial debut in the form of a light bulb in a ‘ matter of months ’			1
the bulb contains a filament - shaped led coated in the super-strong carbon and is set to go on sale late 2015			2
@entity74 researchers behind the bulb claim it will last longer and be cheaper to make than conventional leds , as well as slash energy use by 10 per cent			0
it looks like a traditional light bulb , but the graphene coating enables it to conduct electricity and heat more effectively , to facilitate the improved performance , meaning users wo n't have to change their bulbs as regularly			2
it was designed at the @entity88 , where graphene was discovered , and will be made by @entity90 , a @entity74 - registered company that ’s a spin - out from the university			0
the university said in a statement : ‘ it is expected that the graphene light bulbs will be on the shelves in a matter of months , at a competitive cost			0
’ this implies that the graphene bulbs may cost less than @entity70 bulbs , which can be priced at around £ 15			0
while you may imagine that the brightness of a light bulb may dictate how many insects are drawn towards it , scientists from the @entity103 say it ’s the colour of the light that matters most			1
@entity111 , associate professor of spatial sciences at the university , said future led bulb designs could be customised to be less attractive to specific insect species			0
all insects are attracted to ‘ white ’ light , which is a combination of all colours , but different insects are sensitive to particular combinations of these wavelengths			1
for example , blue , violet , and ultraviolet wavelengths are especially attractive to moths and some other insect groups , so these wavelengths were turned down in experimental light bulb			1
however , the light it emitted , still appeared white to humans			2
professor @entity111 led a team , with help from @entity133 in the @entity134 , with the aim of reducing the number of insects an led bulb can attract while still maintaining white light for indoor use			1
dr @entity141 , a senior scientist at @entity142 , said : ‘ for the purpose of this study , we created unique and one - off led lamp designs that can be customised to emit different colour wavelengths to reduce the attraction of insects			1
‘ this is where lighting meets health and well - being			0
’ the bulbs were tested against off - the - shelf commercial led bulbs , compact fluorescent bulbs and a control with no bulb			0
professor @entity111 ’s research team fixed each bulb over traps in several locations in @entity164 – two in the @entity166 to represent rural locations and one in the city of @entity170			0
sand flies infect people with a protozoan parasite responsible for 20,000 deaths annually , while mosquitos , ( pictured ) which are also drawn to the light , carry malaria which kills more than 600,000 people a year in just over a month , they collected 5,579 insects in the traps , it was reported in the journal @entity183 the order @entity185 , which mosquitoes belong to , represented almost seven in every 10 insects caught			2
they found that despite the customised bulbs being brighter than the led bulbs , they attracted 20 per cent fewer insects			0
he said : ‘ the research provides proof in concept that led lamps can be customised to avoid specific areas of the spectrum that could have adverse environmental consequences , while still providing light for indoor use			0
’ ‘ for places in the world where glass windows and screens are uncommon , reducing insect attraction to indoor lights is a big deal			0
’ ‘ future research is needed into the light attraction of individual vector species and with the current configurations in the tropics , but the current results indicate a viable path forward			0

bulb was created by the @entity103 and @entity142
emits less green and blue light to be less appealing to insects
light still looks a normal ' white ' to humans so it could be used in the home
could save lives by discouraging bugs carrying disease entering homes
