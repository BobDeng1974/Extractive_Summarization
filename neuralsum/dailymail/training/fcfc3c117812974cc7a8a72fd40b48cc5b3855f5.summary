some people are excited by the prospect of driverless cars , which allow passengers to kick back and enjoy the ride without a care in the world			1
but others worry that the technology could lead to diminished responsibility on the roads			0
in a bid to strike a balance and speed up the development of the technology while keeping motorists safe , the @entity11 ( @entity12 ) will grant licenses to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as september			1
driving test : the @entity11 ( @entity12 ) will grant licenses to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as september			1
a @entity23 self - driving car , a white @entity22 , is pictured cars could be driving themselves down @entity26 streets far sooner than expected , thanks to a change in a global treaty backed by @entity26 countries			1
a little - noticed amendment to the @entity33 @entity32 agreed last month would let drivers take their hands off the wheel of self - driving cars			2
it was pushed by @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , whose high - end carmakers believe they are ready to zoom past @entity45 tech pioneers and bring the first ' autonomous vehicles ' to market			0
moving from test drives to marketable products was held back by @entity50 8 of the @entity51 , which stipulates : ' every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals			2
' the amendment agreed last month by the @entity57 on @entity58 would allow a car to drive itself , as long as the system ' can be overridden or switched off by the driver '			0
a driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time			0
provided the amendment clears all bureaucratic hurdles , all 72 countries that are party to the convention would have to work the new rules into their laws			0
the convention covers @entity26 countries , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , although not the @entity45 , @entity76 or @entity77			0
the licenses will cost $ 150 ( £ 89 ) for 10 vehicles and up to 20 ‘ test ’ drivers , but they are designed for the testing of the technology by manufacturers such as @entity23 , rather than members of the public			1
the terms of the licence are strict and say that a car ‘ needs to be insured for at least $ 5,000,000 ( £ 3million ) against personal injury , death , or property damage			0
’ the rules say that test drivers must sit in the driver 's seat and be capable of immediately taking control of the vehicle			1
they will also have to have complete a training programme and obey all the usual rules of the road			0
‘ the test driver must have been a licensed driver for at least three years , with no more than one point on their license and no accidents that resulted in injuries , ’ the @entity12 said			2
the rules also state that any accidents that occur while operating an autonomous car , which result in damage or injury , must be reported to the authorities within 10 days			0
currently the states of @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 allow the testing of @entity23 's autonomous vehicles on their roads			2
applications for the license open in july and the first licenses are set to be granted in september			1
however , members of the public will have to wait longer before they are let loose on public roads hands - free as their car drives for them			2
‘ rules governing public operation of autonomous vehicles are currently being developed by @entity12 and are expected to be adopted by january 1 , 2015 , ’ the department said			1
easy rider : the licences only apply to employees of autonomous vehicle manufacturers and say that a car ' needs to be insured for at least $ 5,000,000 against personal injury , death , or property damage			0
' the rules state that test drivers must sit in the driver seat ( pictured ) and be capable of immediately taking control of the vehicle			1
