by @entity0 published : 19:34 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 19:34 est , 9 march 2013 extra checks : fears have been raised over the documents presented by foreign nurses to get jobs in @entity7 hospitals an @entity10 watchdog has imposed a recruitment freeze on foreign nurses amid fears that workers could have faked documents to get jobs in @entity7 hospitals			1
nursing regulators admit they do not know how many immigrant workers could have fraudulently secured frontline health positions after faking evidence of their qualifications , experience or identity			0
the freeze means that around 160 nurses are being prevented from filling vacancies in already stretched @entity10 units , while the @entity27 conducts the urgent investigation into its own failings			1
the astonishing disclosure comes after a week in which the regulator was heavily criticised by @entity33			0
it raises major concerns for patient safety and casts doubt on whether the watchdog is fit for purpose			1
officials at the @entity27 told @entity41 that there were concerns over whether documents submitted by job applicants could be verified as genuine , and in some cases whether they had been accurately translated into @entity47			1
the problems emerged during an internal review , which began last month			0
and although it has not yet found any fraudulent documents , the @entity27 has been unable to confirm that no false applications have been made			1
a spokeswoman admitted : ‘ the quality of the information supplied in some cases is not proof of fraud but does not give us the level of confidence we would want			0
’ dr @entity60 , chief executive of the @entity61 , is demanding an explanation , saying : ‘ the @entity27 ’s main job is to protect the public			1
it would seem that it is having problems doing this			0
we are naturally concerned that the @entity27 has felt a need to stop registering foreign nurses			2
they are an important addition to the @entity10 , but public protection is the most important issue			1
’ @entity74 , chief executive of the @entity75 ’ @entity73 , said : ‘ i congratulate the @entity27 on being transparent over this issue because it has huge implications			1
the public will be concerned to hear the regulator telling us they ca n’t guarantee foreign nurses ’ paperwork is genuine			2
‘ if supermarkets can check these kinds of documents before employing someone , why ca n’t the @entity27 ? ’ protection : dr @entity60 , chief executive of the @entity61 has demanded an explanations and said that the @entity27 's purpose is to protect patients the @entity27 regulates nurses and midwives and maintains a register of all of those who are approved to work in @entity7 clinics and hospitals			1
it approves around 1,000 applications a year from nurses coming from outside the @entity98			2
it also investigates bad practice and has the power to strike nurses off the register			2
however , it has recently been criticised for failing to maintain an accurate register , so some nurses were cleared to work even though they were being disciplined or investigated			0
the @entity27 suspended the overseas register in early february and will not reopen it until at least april 2			0
a @entity107 spokesman said : ‘ we aware that the @entity27 is currently undertaking a review of its overseas registration process			0
we expect it to quickly identify any weaknesses in its system and take firm action to ensure patient safety is fully protected			0
’ last week , the @entity27 was criticised by the powerful @entity115 for ‘ failing to properly prioritise patient safety ’ by not enforcing enough checks that nurses had a good grasp of @entity47 .			0

freeze means 160 nurses prevented from filling @entity10 vacancies
