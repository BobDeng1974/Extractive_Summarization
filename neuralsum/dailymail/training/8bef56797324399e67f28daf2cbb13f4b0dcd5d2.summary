by @entity0 ' threat ' dr @entity1 , chairman of the @entity3 , urged the government to give doctors more cash doctors were lambasted last night for complaining that the gp service was under ‘ threat of extinction ’ at the same time as demanding a pay rise			1
the @entity3 said some surgeries could be forced to close because of a ‘ toxic mix ’ of increasing workloads and smaller budgets			1
and the @entity16 said the government ’s offer of another below - inflation pay rise had left doctors with a ‘ deep sense of outrage ’ , and a poll of @entity24 found that more than half were considering early retirement			1
last night , angry mps said the traditional family doctor service would not be at risk if @entity24 were not paid so much			1
ten years ago , doctors took advantage of a botched contract to increase their pay by a third			1
the vast majority also opted out of responsibility for their patients out of hours - during evenings , bank holidays and at weekends			2
pay has fallen slightly over the past few years thanks to a series of public sector pay freezes , but gps still earn an average of £ 105,000 a year , despite working fewer hours than previously			2
hospital consultants have also benefited from generous pay increases			0
yesterday dr @entity1 , chairman of the @entity3 , said the critical state of general practice was affecting patient care			1
she urged the government to set aside more funding			0
‘ general practice as we know it is now under severe threat of extinction , ’ she said			0
‘ it is imploding faster than people realise and patients are already bearing the brunt of the problem			1
‘ this will only get worse unless urgent action is taken to redress the huge and historic imbalance in funding			0
we can no longer guarantee a future for general practice as our patients know it			0
‘ we are being seriously crippled by a toxic mix of increasing workloads and ever dwindling budgets			0
’ a survey commissioned by the body found that a third of people were unable to get an appointment for themselves or a family member in the same week the last time they tried			0
dr @entity1 ’s intervention came a day after dr @entity83 , chairman of the @entity16 council , wrote to health secretary @entity85 over the latest pay deal , under which @entity88 staff would receive a 1 per cent pay rise only if they were not eligible for incremental pay rises			1
hospital doctors receive this so - called ‘ progression pay ’ , which is designed to reward the gaining of skills and experience			2
@entity24 receive something similar , called seniority pay			0
attack : dr @entity1 's intervention came the day after the chairman of the @entity16 attacked health secretary @entity85 ( pictured ) over his latest nhs pay deal dr @entity83 told mr @entity85 : ‘ your deliberate conflation of pay progression and cost - of - living uplift is particularly misplaced			1
leaving aside the fact that a 1 per cent uplift would in no way keep pace with the increases in the cost of living , incremental pay progression is ... required to recognise learning and development in a role			0
’ last night @entity117 , a @entity118 mp on the @entity120 health select committee , said : ‘ it ’s an odd argument for doctors to on the one hand be complaining about pressure on @entity88 budgets , while on the other hand be demanding @entity88 money be taken from patients to enhance their already generous salaries			2
’ @entity130 , a @entity118 mp and member of the no 10 policy board , added : ‘ the priority of @entity24 should be putting the patient first and delivering high - quality local healthcare provision			0
‘ family doctors provide a very , very important public service and they are rewarded accordingly but the truth is they need to adapt			1
most people work , so they want to see a gp at the weekend , for example			2
’ a @entity16 survey of 420 family doctors found that 57 per cent were considering early retirement because of heavy workloads			2
a spokesman for the @entity147 said : ‘ we have cut @entity24 ’ targets by more than a third to free up more time with patients and are dramatically increasing trainees so that @entity140 numbers continue to grow faster than the population			0

@entity3 warned surgeries could be closed
chairman dr @entity1 said gp services were ' imploding ' under cuts
but @entity162 said the service would not be at risk if doctors were paid less
