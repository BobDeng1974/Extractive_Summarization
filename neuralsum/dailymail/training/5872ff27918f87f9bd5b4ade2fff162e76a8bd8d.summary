she 's the celebrity lifestyle guru known to her fans as the ' @entity3 ' and caused outrage when her book , @entity6 , championed the merits of putting yourself first - regardless of what others think			1
now @entity12 is back and this time she 's turned her attention to parents , whom , she says , need to learn to say no to their children			1
but is she right ? her views might enrage you but here she explains why being a ' selfish parent ' can be good for your children			1
take control : celebrity lifestyle guru @entity12 says parents need to be much more selfish ' it ’s a well - known fact , the more attention , care and love we give to our children , the better parents we are and , in turn , the better human beings our children will grow up to be			1
but it just is n’t true			2
the more you give in , the less respect you ’ll receive from your children and the more things and stuff they ’ll expect to get away with			1
with all the pressure building up , the moments when you ’d give anything to get out of the house become more and more frequent			1
by the time the children hit puberty , you are like a set of guitar strings at a rock concert - with your nervous system , aka the guitar , stretched to breaking point			1
so how do you deal with the pain of parenting , protect your children from your own tantrums and attempt to inject a little peace and mutual respect into your nest ? me time : parents should schedule in time for themselves and not chase their children around constantly discovery : according to @entity12 , letting children do their own thing while you do yours is a good idea perhaps it ’s time you learned how to be selfish to protect your sanity , your health and to ensure your long lasting support and presence in your child 's life			1
and who would be best to learn from how to be selfish ? from your very own progeny of course ! they know how to be selfish best			1
kids are excellent psychologists and are great at getting other people to do their tasks for them			2
get your kids to do stuff for you			2
you are not their servant , nor the doormat			2
the earlier you stop behaving like one , the earlier they ’ll grow to respect you			2
it 's even better if you can find some tasks to do together , although do n't forget to throw in some fun and enjoyable activities too			1
but it 's not just about your child			1
just as they are your responsibility , so is your body so make some time to take care of it			2
create a close network of parents - friends , and agree on a day when they look after your kids so that you get some ‘ you ’ - time			1
return the favour to keep the benefits coming			2
then there 's dealing with the inevitable tantrums and endless arguments about @entity105 's desire to do something other than homework or chores			1
the longer you take to explain yourself , the shorter time you have left for doing your chores and that much needed and important ‘ you ’ time			2
say what you need to say ( two sentences max ) and get on with your and your child ’s life			2
your children will hear what you said ( even adults only remember the first and the last statements ) and you will be heard			1
which at times is so important to overworked mothers			2
kids learn from you too			0
make sure you are an ever - lasting source of knowledge and inspiration , so sign up for adult courses			0
be adventurous , choose things that are exciting and different to your daily routine			0
for example : sculpture making , life drawing classes , language courses , singing lessons			0
but although you are n't the only one who benefits from learning , that does n't mean you need to over-praise your children when they deign to pick up a pen			1
@entity139 plans : @entity12 is known as the ' @entity3 ' to her fans and says she can help you achieve both best seller : @entity12 's book how to be selfish champions the concept of putting yourself first there is a constant battle between teachers and kids that is directed at getting the results			1
the results that school first of all seek			0
the priority is clearly on success and some kids are getting all worked up trying to please adults without even understanding why something is good and why something is bad			0
if a child , after a long struggle , finally solves her math tasks , does she really need to be told that she has done well ? does n’t she know , without being told , that she has accomplished something ? do n’t waste your time over-praising			0
do n’t call your kid ‘ good girl ’			0
let children get on with their own discoveries , while you get on with your life			1
do n’t we have enough ‘ failures ’ from trying to please our parents ? to make what you want crystal clear , say it once and then get on and do it			1
believe me , it ’s easier when kids know where they stand with you			0
if you say that you want to see the movie , but then go to the kitchen , and start cleaning the mess , you send mixed signals to your children			1
they do n’t think that you have to clean the kitchen			0
they think the words you say are worth ignoring			0
next time you say ' i want to go to a movie ' and you still need to clean up , say ' i want to go to the movie , but first i need to clean up the kitchen because the mess makes me upset '			0
no - no : spending your days indulging your child 's every whim could result in big problems for both of you if the child offers you help , take it			1
children want you happy ! then go to the movie			1
the children will know your words ‘ are worth listening to			2
' finally , stop sacrificing your happiness for your child ’s satisfaction			0
such ‘ samaritan ’ acts are a double - edged sword in disguise			0
today the child is happy , tomorrow they ask for more			0
you want to see your child smiling , you now need to bend yourself more			0
who wins ? in the long run , it wo n't be you or the child			0
you will pay with your mental and physical health , the child later will pay another significant price			0
kids know when they make you suffer			0
they regret it and they start blaming themselves			0
slowly they resent themselves , and then … surprise , surprise , you , for letting them make you suffer			0
instead , stop accepting the pressure from your children - or indeed , the other parents who feel the need to impose their methods on you			1
choose your own way in parenting , and in your personal life			0
the child will follow your example eventually and you ’ll be rewarded twice over			0
you ’ll get to keep your life ( well , most if it ! ) ; and your child will grow up with a better understanding of an individual space , needs and responsibilities			0
