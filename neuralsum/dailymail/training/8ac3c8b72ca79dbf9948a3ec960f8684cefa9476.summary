cancer is set to overtake heart disease and stroke as @entity5 's biggest killer , experts are predicting			1
the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease has dropped across the country and most of @entity11 , scientists have found			1
and a ' tipping point ' is approaching when deaths from stroke and heart disease will be outnumbered by fatalities due to cancer - especially among men			1
the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease has dropped across the country and most of @entity11 , scientists have found cardiovascular disease ( @entity23 ) has declined across most of the continent , but the rates of deaths vary enormously from western to eastern @entity11 , researchers found			1
in @entity5 , the @entity23 death rates for 2010 were 205 and 129 per 100,000 men and women respectively			0
researchers found that in some @entity32 countries , including @entity33 and @entity34 , the death rate from coronary heart disease for 55 to 60 - year - olds is greater than the equivalent rate for people from @entity40 who are twenty years older			1
scientists said that @entity23 remains the single , greatest cause of death among @entity11 than any other disease , and , in many countries causes twice as many deaths as cancer			2
but researchers found there were some countries where cancer was now already causing more deaths than heart disease in men			1
the countries included @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity40 , @entity58 , @entity59 , the @entity60 , @entity62 @entity61 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
the research was led by dr @entity66 , of the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) @entity68 at the @entity69			0
researchers found there were some countries where cancer was now already causing more deaths than heart disease in men ( file picture ) she said cancer had also overtaken @entity23 as the main cause of death among women in one @entity32 country - @entity57			1
the report 's co-author dr @entity82 , said : ' the reason why cancer has overtaken cardiovascular disease as the main cause of death in these countries is due to the fact that fewer people develop cardiovascular disease and , in those who do , fewer die from it			2
' this is probably due to improvements in the behavioural risk factors associated with @entity23 , such as decreases in the number of people smoking tobacco , along with better treatments , including preventive ones , such as the increasing use of statins			0
' however , increases in some risk factors , such as rising levels of obesity , suggest that these decreasing trends may be in danger of reversing			0
' dr @entity66 and her colleagues in the @entity69 research group looked at trends in deaths from @entity23 over a period of ten years analysing data for 52 out of 53 @entity32 countries - there was no data available for @entity122			2
researchers said that data from the latest available year showed that there were just over four million deaths , 1.9 million men and 2.2 million women , from @entity23 , close to half of all deaths in @entity11			0
heart disease is still killing three times as many women than breast cancer despite declining death rates across @entity11 - a ' stark reminder ' for them to live a healthier lifestyle , said the @entity67			1
@entity138 , chief executive of the charity and board member of the @entity141 , said : ' it is good news the number of lives being taken too soon by cardiovascular disease is falling across @entity11			1
heart disease is still killing three times as many women as breast cancer despite declining death rates across @entity11 , research has found ( file picture ) ' however , the fact remains heart disease and stroke remain the biggest cause of death among @entity11			1
' perhaps surprisingly , more women are dying from cardiovascular disease than men			0
' these figures are a stark reminder that women need to be more aware of their heart health as heart disease kills almost three times as many women as breast cancer			0
' we have made huge progress in the fight against heart disease and stroke			2
' it is only because of the medical breakthroughs the @entity67 funds , with the help of our generous supporters , that we are finding newer , better ways to prevent , treat and cure heart disease			0
' but there is still a long way to go if we want to narrow the unacceptable gap in survival rates across @entity11			0
' this was made up of 1.8 million deaths from coronary heart disease , one million from cerebrovascular disease ( stroke ) and 1.2 million from other cardiovascular diseases			1
researchers said that just under a million men died before the age of 75 and half a million before the age of 65			0
half a million women died before the age of 75 and just over 200,000 before the age of 65			0
three in every ten deaths of @entity11 aged under 65 were caused by @entity23 , as were 3 per cent of all deaths occurring before the age of 75 dr @entity82 said : ' the proportion of women who die from cardiovascular disease is much greater than men - 51 per cent of women died compared to 42 per cent of men			1
in @entity5 , the cardiovascular disease death rates for 2010 were 205 and 129 per 100,000 men and women respectively ' this difference is driven mainly by a higher rate of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases among women			1
' there was very little difference in the rates of coronary heart disease between men and women - 20 per cent versus 21 per cent respectively			2
' researchers said that @entity23 death rates are declining in most , but not all @entity32 countries			2
they added that trends have also been downwards for what are known as ' case fatality rates ' - the percentage of people who are diagnosed with a condition and die from the illness within a given period			0
in their paper , the authors say : ' worldwide , there have been few moments in history during which @entity237 [ non-communicable diseases ] have enjoyed such a prominent place in the world 's attention , with cardiovascular disease at the forefront of the activity			0
' despite this , there has been little commitment at the national or regional level to greater monitoring and reporting of risk factors and outcomes for cardiovascular disease			0
' it is clear that in many countries of @entity11 , @entity23 mortality has continued to decrease substantially in recent years , and will make a large contribution to achieving this goal			0
' in these ( predominantly high income ) countries , a " tipping point " is rapidly approaching , when cancer deaths will outnumber cardiovascular disease deaths , particularly among men			1
' in many other countries , however , the @entity23 burden dwarfs that of cancer , and a large proportion of the populations will lose their lives prematurely to heart disease and stroke			2
' the research was published in the @entity274 .			0

@entity276 set to overtake cardiovascular disease as @entity5 's biggest killer
research finds number of deaths from heart disease and stroke is declining
numbers also drop in @entity11 but rates vary from west to eastern countries
@entity276 already causing more deaths in @entity40 , @entity292 , @entity63 and @entity56
scientists expect ' tipping point ' when same will be true in most ' high income ' @entity32 nations
