these adorable abandoned badger cubs have been nursed back to health by a kind - hearted animal lover on a diet of custard creams			1
the orphaned youngsters - one of which escaped death after being carried away in a @entity9 's mouth - are doing better than ever after they were taken in by retired farmer @entity10			0
nursed originally on milk form bottles custard creams were introduced into their diet slowly to see whether the cubs were ready for food			1
the 65 - year - old , from @entity43 , said : ' when they came in eight weeks ago they were 80g , now they 're 1.1kg , you can almost see them growing			1
' ' they were very very tiny , we start them off giving them milk with a teat on syringe , we ca n't risk any getting in their lungs , but they 're now on normal bottles			1
' @entity32 came from @entity55 , she was brought into someone 's kitchen by their @entity9 dog , it was very lucky he did n't hurt her , she 'd been born two days earlier ; her umbilical was still attached ' the dog brought another one in , but sadly that one had been shaken , so unfortunately it died within 24 hours @entity10 explained to have two badger cubs picked up by dogs in a short space of time is unusual			1
' one cub a year is brought in when dogs get down in the set , ' she said			2
the dog brought another one in , but sadly that one had been shaken , so it died within 24 hours the first of the badger cubs , named @entity32 , was half the weight of an apple when it arrived at centre @entity9 have an instinct for digging and going down holes and are traditionally used in badger baiting			1
however , there is no reason to suspect the illegal blood - sport was to blame for the death of this cub			2
' then we had another called @entity87 come up from @entity88 , we called her that because was picked up in the village @entity87 near @entity90 , ' @entity10 said			1
' then lastly the third came in three weeks ago , that one 's from near @entity93 in @entity43 , we called him @entity94 , because of the cider context when they came in eight weeks ago they were 80g - carers have watched them grow to 1.1kg they 're 12 to 16 weeks once they wean , then they might be moved on to solids by the carers ' we 've been keeping @entity94 separate as he 's older than the two girls			2
once they start to mouth things , they start playing with each other , pulling ears , @entity94 can get a bit rough though			0
' ' they 're still on bottles now , we 've started putting in custard creams to see if they 're interested , then we might move them on to solids			1
' they 're in the cubby hole in my kitchen now			0
' the aim is to release the animals back into the wild once they 're strong enough			2
they 're all vaccinated against @entity122 , before they reduce human contact			0
@entity10 said : ' we 'll add another two to the group , we 'll keep them together before release in autumn			0
' when they 're 12 to 16 weeks once they wean , they go down to the @entity130 , which is a separate building			0
' after that they turn nocturnal , we feed them at night , then it 's on to glassed enclosures when we just throw the food over to them and get them to revert to wild			0
' ' sadly if we ca n't release them , we do have to put them to sleep , which is why we reduce human contact like that			0
' after they move to their nocturnal sleep rhythm they will be put in glass enclosures and then released			0
