it says everything about @entity2 that @entity3 had to delay announcing him as one - day captain until saturday because they could not contact him in @entity6			1
‘ when i got up there were about 20 missed calls from @entity13 , ’ said the man currently on @entity9 business in @entity10			2
‘ so i thought i ’d better give him a ring			0
he said , “ we ’d like to offer you the captaincy ” and i was delighted			0
being offered the captaincy is awesome			0
it ’s a huge honour			0
’ note that @entity2 was paying little attention to what was going on in @entity3 without him			1
he must have known that friday was @entity25 squad decision day and surely he knew that @entity26 was under increasing pressure			1
@entity2 has an excellent batting average when captaining @entity3 , and will hope to keep that up the new captain , currently playing in @entity10 , was n't checking his phone when the decision was made @entity2 is a calm , shrewd operator , who must have known he was likely to replace the sacked @entity26 yet the cool , calm , singular @entity35 remained detached , not exactly waiting by his phone or scouring @entity36 for news of the biggest development of his career			1
he is shrewd enough to know that he was the obvious alternative to @entity26 but his apparent indifference suggests that he will take his promotion in his stride			1
@entity2 is truly his own man			1
it was fascinating to read the assessment of @entity48 , who captained @entity2 during his days at @entity49 , of the man who will try to make @entity3 credible @entity25 challengers			1
‘ gifted but calculating , affable but wary , engaging but hard to read , @entity2 has played his hand well en route to the @entity3 captaincy , ’ said @entity48 in @entity52			1
‘ he is highly rated but not clearly understood			0
just as he likes things			0
’ it sums up @entity2 perfectly			1
@entity2 can be hard to read , but he will bring a new energy , and a new outlook , to @entity3 's one - day game @entity26 paid the price for poor performances with the bat and a slow scoring rate in @entity65 @entity2 is ambitious and talented , and has shown his talent both at home and in the global t20 leagues @entity3 ’s resolve to move on without @entity70 remains as strong as ever despite his desperate @entity36 pleas and the appointment of his friend @entity2 to the one - day captaincy			1
national selector @entity13 was irritated when @entity70 ’s name came up at @entity76 on saturday and said : ‘ no , no , no ’ when asked if there was a way back for the sacked star			0
he added : ‘ the @entity81 management made this decision in january and it is the same decision now			0
there is no way that @entity70 will ever get back into an @entity3 team			2
he ’s no longer part of @entity3 cricket			2
’ so unless everybody at the @entity81 is sacked and replaced by a selection panel of @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 there is no way back for @entity70			2
the @entity95 is nothing if not ambitious , as he showed when he threw in his lot with @entity3 in 2009 three years after making his one - day debut with @entity99			2
this is a significant change of policy by @entity3 , an admission that they have to think of 50 - over cricket as an extension of @entity105 rather than a reduced form of test cricket			2
they need a different approach and largely different personnel			0
@entity110 understands their original intention was to replace @entity26 as one - day captain after the @entity25 with @entity113			1
but a change of plan has been necessary now			0
for the first time , @entity3 will have different captains for different formats , with @entity2 almost certain to replace @entity119 as @entity105 captain to unite the limited - overs formats			1
‘ to have two captains gives us the chance to develop a one - day side in a slightly different way , ’ said managing director @entity122			0
‘ it may well be that we will look to evolve slightly different teams			0
’ so what sort of captain will @entity2 be ? well , he will lead @entity3 in his own , calm image			1
the @entity81 had intended to make @entity113 captain after the @entity25 , but had to make the decision earlier replacing @entity26 with @entity2 indicates that @entity3 have decided to treat @entity134 more like @entity135 than @entity136 ‘ i really enjoy being captain , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ it puts a lot more onus on your performance , your contribution to the team and your tactics as the game unfolds			0
those are things i really enjoy			0
as captain i want to keep things simple and honest			2
' i do n’t have a huge amount of time to influence the side but my main aspirations for the group are to take advantage of them being naturally hard - working and skilful			0
’ there are the makings of a decent @entity3 one - day side here			2
the question , in the short term , is whether they will have any better chance of causing an upset at the @entity25 with @entity2 rather than @entity26 in charge			1
we will soon discover the answer .			0

@entity2 will be @entity3 's @entity134 captain for *upcoming* @entity25
the @entity35 replaced @entity26 after *disappointing* @entity65 tour
@entity2 will bring his calm manner to @entity3 to @entity25 bid
