by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 6 may 2013 @entity2 's youthful despot @entity1 today made his first visit to the secretive state 's latest scientific facility - an institute dedicated to research into grass			1
the 29 - year - old toured the @entity9 of the @entity10 under the @entity11 in suburban @entity12 with his usual coterie of generals in tow			0
it was the first time the young dictator has been pictured since @entity18 and comes after @entity2 yesterday revealed a few more details about an @entity20 just sentenced to 15 years ' hard labour			2
another tour : @entity2 leader @entity1 inspects the newly built @entity9 of the @entity10 under the @entity11 in suburban @entity12 , his first official visit since @entity18 @entity12 officials claimed @entity25 entered @entity2 with a false identity and rejected speculation that they intend to use his jail sentence as a bargaining chip			1
today though , @entity1 appeared to put all thoughts of international diplomacy behind him as he walked the corridors and labs of the @entity9 , which state media described as ' newly constructed by soldiers '			0
he ' was pleased to see the green - tiled outer wall ' and he ' praised the soldier - builders for erecting the monument to the institute in an imposing manner , ' according to translations of local news reports published by the blog @entity46			0
accompanied by a group of uniformed senior military personnel , but clad in his customary luxuriously tailored baggy suit , @entity1 toured the institutes exhibition of its accomplishments , its research facilities , study centre and e-library			0
he also toured the @entity9 's greenhouses where various species of grass are cultivated for research , its commissary and its staff quarters			0
do n't step on the grass : @entity1 talks to an official in one of the @entity9 's greenhouses , where research is carried out into different varieties of turf			2
he said it was essential to find varieties that are green all year round take this down : @entity1 speaks as his generals take note of his decrees			0
he spoke of ' the need to plant trees , create grassland and cultivate flowers and other plants in all lands except the cultivated land , ' @entity75 reported veeery interesting : clad in his customary luxuriously tailored baggy suit , @entity1 toured the institute 's exhibition of its accomplishments ( seen here ) , its research facilities , study centre and e-library ' what is essential in the research into turf is to cultivate turf which remains green all the year round , strong in resistance to cold and treading and high in ornamental effect , ' @entity1 said , according to the state - run @entity97			1
he also spoke of ' the need to plant trees , create grassland and cultivate flowers and other plants in all lands except the cultivated land so that there may be no land left waste or overgrown with weed			1
' @entity1 's words came as @entity108 @entity25 continued to be held in a @entity2 jail at the start of his sentence for alleged crimes against the communist state			1
in remarks carried by state media , an unidentified @entity115 spokesman did not specify the @entity120 man 's crimes but said he confessed			0
he said @entity25 entered @entity2 ' with a disguised identity in an intentional way under the back - stage manipulation of the forces hostile toward ' the country			1
on the straight and narrow : @entity1 ' was pleased to see the green - tiled outer wall ' and ' praised the soldier - builders for erecting the monument to the institute in an imposing manner , ' @entity75 reported so you put your hands like this , and push ? @entity1 asks questions about the equipment used at the institute let 's fo that way ! the young despot points into the distance as he wanders out of the institute , perhaps on his way to deal with pressing matters of international diplomacy like the jailing of @entity20 @entity25 @entity25 , 44 , was arrested in early november in @entity146 , a special economic zone in @entity2 's far north - eastern region bordering @entity149 and @entity150 , according to the @entity2 's state media			1
friends say @entity25 is a devout @entity153 and tour operator based in @entity149 who traveled frequently to @entity2 to feed orphans			2
hard labour : @entity25 was arrested in early november in @entity146 , a special economic zone in @entity2 's far north - east , near its borders with @entity149 and @entity150 six other @entity20 have been detained in @entity2 since 2009 ; they eventually were deported or released , some after trips by prominent @entity20 including former presidents @entity161 and @entity163			1
but the @entity2 spokesman dismissed as ' ridiculous and wrong ' speculation by foreign media that @entity12 intends to use @entity25 as a bargaining chip for another such visit to the country			1
he said the ' generosity ' the country showed in past cases ' will be of no use in ending @entity20 ' illegal acts			0
' @entity2 ' has no plan to invite anyone of the @entity20 as regards @entity179 's issue , ' the spokesman said			0
@entity12 refers to @entity25 as @entity180 , the @entity2 spelling for his @entity2 name			1
@entity25 's sentencing last week came as tension remains on the @entity185 following weeks of warlike rhetoric from @entity12 and threats to attack the @entity20 and @entity188			2
the @entity20 has called for the @entity2 to grant amnesty and immediately release @entity25			2
the @entity20 and @entity2 officially remain at war because the 1950 - 53 @entity191 ended with an armistice , not a peace treaty			0
despite the continuing crisis , thoughts of war appeared to be the back of the @entity2 leader 's mind today at the @entity9 where , according to @entity75 , he ' underscored the need to turn the country into a socialist thriving nation and make it richer and more beautiful for the people			0
