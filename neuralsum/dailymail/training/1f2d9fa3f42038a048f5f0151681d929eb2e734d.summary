@entity5 , who is originally from the @entity6 but now lives in @entity7 , took 12,076 pictures in and around the capital 's landmark , and then spent seven - and - a - half hours condensing these into 3,878 to make the video			1
the 37 - year - old spent over 18 hours in @entity7 shooting the footage			1
@entity14 @entity5 captured some spectacular scenes in his timelapse of @entity17 mr @entity5 took 12,076 pictures in and around the capital 's landmark and then condensed them into 3,878 to make the video speaking to @entity20 , mr @entity5 said : - ' i 've filmed a couple of times in the underbelly of @entity2 for various programmes , but i 've never actually been up to the walkways			1
' the exposed ironwork , girders , suspension and the sheer amount of rivets put in to hold it altogether is mind - blowing considering it 's 120 years old			0
' during one of the shots i rested against one of the top suspension cables taking in the views and you could feel the feint vibrations of the traffic below , the cables that have resonated the crossing of probably , billions of people over years gone past and now with the addition of the glass floors , it 's a great sight to behold			1
' everyone is on a journey somewhere			0
' before the stampede : the inside the bridge before tourists from all over the world ascend on @entity7 's most famous bridge the glass walkway , which opened last month , where tourists can pay £ 9 to walk through and view the hustle and bustle on the roads below impressive : mr @entity5 described @entity2 as structurally ' mind blowing , considering it is 120 years old ' @entity2 last month unveiled its £ 1m glass walkway 140ft above @entity64 , costing just £ 9 to visit			1
it has been designed to give tourists , sightseers and thrill - seekers a unique view from a bridge that bills itself as the most famous in the world , not forgetting a peek at the workings of a legendary feat of engineering when the bridge below opens			0
for the faint of heart or weak of knee , it may be reassuring to learn that each glass panel along the 36ft walkway is getting on for three inches thick and weighs nearly 1,200lb			0
the iconic @entity2 is a magnificent sight to behold , and even better when contrasted at various points throughout the day the brand new glass walkway , which is designed to enthrall the general public , rather than instill fear the view from the £ 1million glass walkway ; each glass panel along the 36ft walkway is around three inches thick and weighs nearly 1,200lb @entity90 executives insist the idea is to enthral rather that scare people			2
@entity5 added : ' shooting timelapse for a living means that i get to spend a lot of time on rooftops for sunrise and sunsets for various tv companies			2
' i 've recently filmed from the @entity102 but the vintage view from @entity2 is certainly unique			0
' @entity5 is doing a free talk about timelapse this saturday ( december 6 ) in @entity106 , @entity7 and he will be attempting to create the biggest crowd - sourced timelapse of @entity7			2
