it 's hoped a new trial , which is set to see pre-schoolers learn a second language , will help to boost the declining numbers of high school students studying languages across @entity7			1
the federal government has selected 40 pre-schools from more than 1,000 applicants to take part in the trial , called @entity13 , which will use play based apps starting from next year			1
' our children are now techsperts from early on , particularly with the vast array of interactive early education applications and games that are now available at their fingertips , ' said the assistant minister for education @entity23			2
a new trial will teach pre schoolers a second language			1
40 pre schools across @entity7 have been selected to start the one year trial early next year it is hoped teaching pre schoolers a second language will help to boost the declining numbers of high school students studying a language ' this play - based approach is therefore a fun and easy way to get our kids interested in learning skills for life , such as a language other than @entity43 , from early on in their education journey			1
' assistant education minister @entity23 ( pictured ) says the government wants to give kids an early insight into other cultures following on from the strong response to participate in the trial , ms @entity23 said it clearly shows the @entity53 public wants the chance for their kids to learn another language from the early years through to year 12			1
' and it 's easy to see why , when the proportion of year 12 students studying a language other than @entity43 has dropped from about 40 per cent in the 1960s to about 12 per cent today , ' said ms @entity23			1
' we also hope it will give our kids an early insight into other cultures and help promote inclusive communities , given almost one - in - five @entity53 speak a language other than @entity43 at home			1
' 12 pre schools in @entity71 will be taking part in the trial which offers five different languages including @entity75 ( @entity76 ) , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 or @entity80			1
@entity82 pre school in @entity84 's west will be teaching @entity85 to their children and believe learning a language and literacy are two of the most important things for a child to learn			1
' learning a language you can have a better understanding of cultures and connect with the community , ' said school principal @entity97			2
' at an early age the learning capacity for children is optimal , the first five years is the best time they can learn			2
' ' we had a @entity77 student here a few years ago who taught the kids a few words and they really enjoyed it , i think they will love it and it will definitely help the children to be engaged , ' she said			2
the trial will also reach nine pre-schools in @entity114 , eight in @entity115 , five in @entity7 , three in @entity116 and one in @entity118 , the @entity119 and the @entity120			1
@entity121 on @entity122 in @entity124 's south east have been very much focused on their kids learning a language			0
' it 's a big part of my philosophy , ' said school principal @entity129 , ' we come from big multicultural backgrounds			0
' the teacher who was born in @entity133 and lived in @entity134 for 20 years says she knows five different languages and did n't realise how much she would end up using them			0
' it 's so important to understand and to be able to connect with people of the world , to do business with them , ' she said			0
' we 're no longer local populations , we need to look at global jobs , look at children travelling to @entity143 for work and help them to do that			0
' 40 pre schools across @entity7 will be able to teach their kids a second language , offering , @entity75 ( chinese ) , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 or @entity80 40 pre schools will take part in the trial for children to learn second languages a year ago ms @entity129 followed up on research into what languages primary schools were learning around the area			1
' we wanted to see which language we could teach our kids so when they move to primary school they had an advantage			2
' she found that @entity78 was a popular language so when applying she chose @entity78 which they were granted			2
' this announcement came as a timely beneficial opportunity , hence we jumped on it , ' she said			0
' very important , children learn from each other , it 's an important part of learning			0
' a high school @entity76 teacher in @entity116 believes pre-schoolers should definitely be learning languages			1
' learning a second language not only helps you to understand a different culture and way of thinking , it also helps you to understand your first language better , ' she said			0
' these days we do n’t tend to teach @entity43 in the old way of understanding the parts of language : verb , adjective , pronoun etc. however when you learn a second language you invariably come across these terms ( metalanguage ) and are able to understand and apply it much better			1
' she believes that even if students swap and change their language later on , they should have the foundations of understanding the parts of a language			0
there 's hope that teaching pre schoolers a second language will help to boost declining numbers in high school students studying languages ' in an ideal world , this would also positively impact numbers in high school years			1
hopefully it will , that remains to be seen , ' she said			0
' with the increasing globalisation of the world , it is important for our future generation of students to be able to speak another language and respect and attempt to understand another culture			0
@entity43 and the @entity223 world is no longer enough			0
' the federal opposition has criticised the trial , saying it was meant to cover 400,000 students , but it is now only going to be rolled out in 40 centres			2
they have also questioned the government on allocating the full $ 9.8 million of funding for the one year period			0
' it is being spun as a trial of a trial but what this government would be better off doing is just delivering what they promised they would , ' said shadow education minister @entity240			0
' this is a clear broken promise – just like the billion dollars of cuts to child care families were told would n’t happen but have been hit with in just a year , ' she said .			0

new trial will see 40 pre-schools teach their children a second language
it 's hoped to *reverse* the declining numbers of high school students in @entity7 studying languages

@entity75 ( @entity76 ) , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 or @entity80 are on offer
