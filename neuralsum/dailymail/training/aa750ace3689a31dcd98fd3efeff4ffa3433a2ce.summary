click here to read @entity2 ' full match report from @entity3 i am a glass half - full person and 11 months out from the final stages of the @entity7 there was a lot to like in that @entity11 performance			1
they will be disappointed not to have won , they had given themselves every chance at half time but ultimately the reality check of playing such a canny @entity19 side will pay dividends			2
@entity19 were not that impressive in the first half but responded , as you always knew they would , and played the conditions much better in the second half			2
in the end they outscored @entity11 three tries to one and that is a statistic we need to note yet again , because they did n’t actually create that many opportunities			2
being @entity19 , though , they took them — their third try was clincal and particularly well executed			2
@entity11 lost 24 - 21 against @entity19 after an impressive second half from the @entity19 at @entity3 @entity11 21 - 24 @entity19 highlights @entity19 celebrate as they exposed @entity11 's weakness ' on a rain soaked afternoon @entity11 need to start taking the chances they make and start scoring three or four tries on a regular basis against the best sides			1
that is the ratio you need to win big matches these days			0
but let ’s concentrate on the positives first			0
over five months on from their last game , @entity11 could and maybe should have beaten the world champions , who are battle - hardened and in the groove after their @entity54 campaign and a warm - up match against @entity56 last week			1
@entity19 have played eight test matches since @entity11 last took the field in anger and that was a big factor			1
@entity11 ’s pack were immense in all respects			1
the front five — minus @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 when he went off injured — dominated the line - out and scrum and that is so important , going forward			0
in the pack @entity11 can compete against any team in the world and they have the strength in depth to ensure such power up - front every time they take the field			1
that is a great position to be in			0
@entity11 's pack dominated the scrum and can compete against any rugby side in the world despite the defeat , @entity11 captain @entity85 was immense and deserved to win man of the match @entity85 was outstanding for @entity11 for the whole 80 minutes and although it seems mandatory to give the man - of - the - match award to somebody from the winning team , i would have opted for the @entity11 skipper and not @entity95			1
he outplayed the @entity19 skipper , not for the first time , in the first half and kept going strongly after the break when @entity11 found the going much tougher and @entity95 , like all great players , raised his game			1
@entity85 is the first name on the @entity11 teamsheet for me but i still maintain he might be better suited to playing at six — not least because he is @entity11 ’s best attacking forward , the most comfortable on the ball and with the best hands			1
at six , when you are not arriving at the contact area first all the time , you often get more opportunity to make go - forward yards as @entity110 does for @entity19			1
i am on record as saying my ideal back row at present would be @entity85 at blindside , @entity114 at seven and @entity115 at eight but clearly that is n’t going to happen with the @entity118 decison to make @entity114 ineligible			2
now is probably not the time for change , anyway			0
@entity120 ( @entity121 ) did better than expected , despite being mismatched against @entity122 @entity123 scores a sensational solo try for @entity11 after only three minutes to send the crowd wild the pack did very well and should be retained en bloc against a @entity129 side that showed in the recent @entity54 they are possibly not the scrummaging force they once were , although their line - out is still top drawer			1
next week will be brutal up front but this @entity11 pack are tough enough for the challenge			1
in the backs @entity120 had a fine first half at centre			0
i will admit to being concerned that perhaps he would n’t be able to match up physically with @entity122 but he did well and the apparent mismatch in size was n’t an issue			0
that cracking pass of his — left to right — should certainly have resulted in a try for @entity148 during @entity11 ’s purple patch in the first half			2
that would have been a peach of a score and would have helped build momentum for @entity11			2
so far so good , but now let ’s consider the things @entity11 need to work on			2
in the second half , with the weather closing in , against the wind and with @entity19 turning up the pressure , @entity11 got bogged down in their own half and suffered from not having a second or third kicking option to clear their lines			1
they simply could not get out of their own half			0
@entity148 , with his big left boot , did not seem to be offering himself and it was at this stage that @entity120 ’s lack of a kicking game came to light			0
ideally , i always prefer a ten and 12 who have a kicking and passing game and that third quarter — and indeed the rest of the game — emphasised that			0
@entity148 's kicking struggled to clear the ball when @entity11 were put under pressure by @entity19 @entity19 's @entity183 won possession and launched counter attacks all too frequently @entity187 ’s box kick was seen as an alternative but it was relied on too heavily and became predictable for @entity190 and @entity191			1
too often they were grateful recipients of the ball and used the possession to launch another @entity19 attack			0
the big games comes at you thick and fast during these @entity199 internationals and you have to embrace that			0
@entity201 and his management team — @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 — earned a massive vote of confidence from the @entity118 recently with those six - year contracts through to 2020			0
it is in phases of the season like the next three weeks where they must all really earn their corn			0
next up come @entity129 — a side who beat @entity19 not so very long ago			0
that @entity11 coaching team need to really analyse exactly what went on at @entity3 and learn from it			1
my gut feeling is that continuity of selection is what is needed now and certainly my experience from my years in charge in these @entity199 campaigns is not to overreact			0
@entity11 coach @entity201 ( r ) must start to earn his long contract in the next test against @entity129 prince @entity229 was pictured watching the match between @entity11 and @entity19 on saturday saturday saw a pretty good all - round performance and nobody produced an individual display which warrants dropping them			1
what i do think though is that with the power @entity11 showed in the tight , they should perhaps concentrate on playing a tighter game — a bit more like @entity238 , if you like			0
if you are not going to pick a 12 who possesses world - class kicking options you probably need to play to your strength up front more			1
a busy week lies ahead but i remain optimistic .			0

@entity11 were beaten 24 - 21 by @entity19 in *autumn* test at @entity3
