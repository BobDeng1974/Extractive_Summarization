numerous coffees have been shared between @entity1 and @entity2 in the cafes of @entity4 but all cordialities will be pushed aside when @entity6 take on @entity7 this weekend			1
@entity1 describes @entity2 , the @entity7 no 10 and his @entity9 team - mate , as an ‘ angry man ’ who has become one of the world ’s finest players under the tutorship of @entity16			1
@entity6 will be keeping close tabs on the fly - half on saturday and @entity1 is planning to use his inside knowledge to minimise the 29 - year - old ’s impact at the @entity22			1
@entity9 's @entity1 is adamant @entity6 can nullify the threat of club team - mate @entity2 ‘ we are good mates in @entity4 and he ’s a guy who demands high standards , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ he ’s an angry man			2
the first time i played with him — i remember it well — was on the @entity31 tour and he was shouting his head off at me and barking orders			2
it took me by surprise a bit			0
‘ he ’s a bloody good player and a very clever thinker about the game			0
he ’s got @entity16 as his mentor in @entity4 who is passing on a lot of information and helping him develop into a wonderful player			0
‘ he is the commander - in - chief of the @entity7 team and a guy we need to stay one step ahead of			1
’ @entity7 's @entity2 has won his battle to be fit to face @entity6 in the @entity47 on saturday few have attracted such far - flung praise during this year ’s @entity47 as @entity2 , who has overcome a hamstring injury and is expected to be named in @entity7 ’s starting xv at today ’s team announcement			1
the @entity51 has an all - round repertoire but his kicking has been particularly important within the gameplan of @entity7 coach @entity55			1
off the back of a dominant breakdown , @entity2 was able to pin back @entity58 last week with his accurate footballing skills			1
it was aperfectly executed strategy and an afternoon that enhanced @entity55 ’s reputation as one of the game ’s most thorough tacticians			0
@entity7 often rely on their choke - tackle routine in defence but the @entity69 coach neglected it against @entity58 to avoid scrummaging against a powerful pack			1
it could return on saturday and @entity1 is prepared for more tactical twists in @entity75			1
@entity2 was in fine form to inspire @entity7 to a 19 - 9 win over @entity58 in @entity78 last time out ‘ they are happy to put bombs up in our 22 if they have to , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ they always come up with a trick or two , so we have to be prepared for that			0
you ’ve seen them have a two - or three - phase set play where they bring their full back near a ruck after phase three or something like that			2
‘ there is usually a trick in there			0
@entity55 is a clever coach ; he is a guy who obviously thinks about the game a lot			0
’ throughout the week , @entity97 and his @entity6 coaching staff have emphasised the importance of playing their own game			1
that means providing front - foot ball for strike - runners , rather than being kicked into submission by a disciplined @entity107 set - up			2
with @entity2 ’s accuracy from the kicking tee , @entity97 must also ensure his players keep their penalty count to a minimum , having seen his side concede 37 in the opening rounds			1
‘ it ’s who blinks first but it ’s also who dares wins , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ these big games are like chess and you try to work each other out in the opening exchanges			0
they are very clever defensively			0
they pick and choose their rucks			0
we have got to be very clever in that respect			0
@entity6 coach @entity97 , at training on wednesday , is adamant his side must play their own game ‘ the contact area is more important than it ever has been and so is the referee ’s interpretation			2
you watch @entity7 ’s games against @entity133 and @entity58 and both sides have given them easy outs from their half with cheap penalties , which gave them a strong foothold in opposition territory			2
’ wales are not underestimating their opponents and there have been no verbal barbs from @entity97			0
he is hoping to reverse a worrying trend in @entity75 , where the @entity107 have lost only twice in 32 years , with retired back - row @entity147 yesterday writing in his column that ‘ @entity6 do n’t scare us like @entity133 and @entity58 ’			1
‘ that @entity151 love and hate is quite evident , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ there is always that edge to it			0
looking back on a personal note there have been more lows than highs against them and that ’s something i am quite keen to rectify			0
‘ i ’ll never forget watching @entity7 win the @entity161 in our stadium in 2009			1
that is one of those moments that motivates you i suppose			0
it ’s something you never want to happen again			0
