@entity0 offers her tips for kids travelling alone @entity0 , 11 , was the subject of controversy when her mother @entity5 wrote in @entity6 about her adventurous five children and how she has no problem with them travelling alone			1
@entity0 , who flew to @entity10 solo when she was nine , is a frequent train traveller making the 200 - mile , three - and - a - half hour journey from home @entity13 to @entity15 , where she boards			1
usually she 's dropped at @entity17 and changes only at @entity18 , but at the weekend she made the entire journey on her own - changing at @entity20 and @entity21 - for the first time			1
@entity0 was n't worried one bit , and here she offers her 10 top tips for other kids making a journey on their lonesome			1
1 allow time when planning a journey , allow plenty of time for everything			1
for instance , if you book in advance , the tickets are much cheaper			2
also it helps you to make sure you will be able to get to the station : make sure you allow plenty of time for this			2
you may think you have enough time , but there might be roadworks or an accident , which could make you miss your train			2
my mother told me we needed to allow forty minutes for a twenty minute drive to the station i need for school			2
i thought she was being silly until the day when there was a long diversion , and we arrived to see my train pulling out			2
@entity0 gets set for a solo train journey - the 11 - year - old travels 200 miles from her family 's home in @entity13 to @entity15 regularly and has also travelled overseas by herself 2 plan carefully make sure you know precisely when your train will get in and what platform it will come in on , especially if you are doing a change			1
my older brother looks all this up on the internet for me before my journey			1
he even prints off a map of the station , showing my platform change and how far it is from one platform to the other , if i have n’t done that change before			2
3 check everything it is very useful to have a pack list when you are going on a journey , so that you know you have everything			1
when you leave your house make sure you check you have everything with you that you will need , and when you leave the platform or the train make sure you keep your belongings with you at all times			2
( it is often a good idea if you need to go to the loo , to ask someone to watch your belongings for you			2
) if you got on the train with three things – for instance : book , bag , coat – make sure you get off with three things too			0

it ’s a good idea always to take a book when you are going on a journey even if you do n’t think you will want to read it			1
if you do n’t have any entertainment , do n’t be afraid to socialise with others around you			0
it can be useful to have a pack of cards			0
you can normally judge if the person next to you will be a sensible and friendly person to engage in a conversation			0
5 take a telephone and make sure you charge it up first and have credit on it ! if it is one of your first journeys alone , it is always a good idea to stay in contact with someone , so that in the unlikely event of something going wrong , there is someone you can tell			0
even if you do n’t have a phone , the train managers are guaranteed to have one you can borrow			0
always make sure you bring someone ’s telephone number			0
@entity0 , now 11 , travelled to @entity10 by herself when she was nine			1
she advises young travellers to plan carefully 6 do n’t panic if something does go wrong ( which it rarely does , but you might miss a connection for instance ) the last thing you should do is panic			0
stay calm and look for an information desk or phone someone at home who can tell you what to do			0
@entity5 ( right ) has no problems with her children , including @entity0 ( left ) , travelling alone 7 recognise uniforms if you need to tell someone something or if you have any questions about your journey , always look for someone who is working with the company that is running your train			1
try to check , before you set off , what the uniform looks like , so they are easier to identify during the journey			1
8 be confident and @entity159 if you do see someone in uniform , or just someone to talk to , never refrain from going and asking for help			0
it is always better to be safe than sorry , so even if you are almost sure you are on the right platform , if you have any doubts , never be worried to ask a member of staff			0
9 be sensible its very unusual that something will go wrong , and even if it does , there is almost always an easy solution			0
taking a journey on your own is all about common sense			1
for instance , it ’s obviously safer to get into a carriage with lots of different people in it			0
and if the train is running late for your connection , you ask the train manager to advise you what to do next			0
you can always ring your parents			0
if you are sensible and careful , and your journey has been properly planned , it is extremely unlikely that anything can go wrong			1
10 @entity191 and @entity192 try not to get worried or stressed about your journey			1
it can often be very relaxing travelling alone ( especially as your parents are n’t there to embarrass you )			0
i ’ve met lots of interesting people travelling alone , and i ’ve learnt a lot from it			0
