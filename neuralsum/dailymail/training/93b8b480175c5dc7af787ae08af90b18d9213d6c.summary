by @entity0 imagine being able to run an optical fibre to any point on @entity3 or in space			1
that is what one physicist says could be possible in the future , opening up the possibility of communicating with colonies of people on @entity12 via a kind of broadband , for example			2
professor @entity16 believes that an ‘ air waveguide ’ could enhance light signals collected from distant sources , making long - distance communication possible as never before			1
physicists at the @entity22 have found a way to make air behave like an optical fibre , which could guide light beams over long distances without losing power the professor of physics at the @entity22 believes waveguides could have many applications , including long - range laser communications , detecting pollution in the atmosphere , making high - resolution topographic maps and even laser weapons			1
as light loses intensity with distance , the range over which such tasks can be done is limited			0
even lasers , which produce highly directed beams , lose focus due to their natural spreading or due to interactions with gases in the air			0
this is an illustration of an air waveguide			1
the filaments leave ' holes ' in the air ( red rods ) that reflect light			0
light ( arrows ) passing between these holes stays focused and intense the air waveguides were made using very short , powerful laser pulses			2
a laser pulse transforms into a narrow beam called a filament , which happens because the laser light increases the refractive index of the air in the centre of the beam , as if the pulse is carrying its own lens with it			2
the refractive index , also called index of refraction , measures of the bending of a ray of light when passing from one medium into another			0
professor @entity16 has previously shown that the filaments heat up the air as they pass through , causing it to expand and leave a ‘ hole ’ of low - density air in their wake			1
this hole has a lower refractive index than the air around it and while the filament itself lasts for just one trillionth of a second , it takes a billion times longer for the hole to appear			0
the physicists have previously showed that four filaments were fired in a square arrangement , produce holes forming the low - density wall needed for a waveguide			1
the ‘ pipe ’ produced by the filaments lasted a few milliseconds , a million times longer than the laser pulse			2
because the waveguides are relatively long - lived , he believes a single guide could be used to send out a laser can collect a signal			1
but fibre optic cables trap light beams and guides them like a pipe , preventing loss of intensity or focus			2
they typically consist of a transparent glass core surrounded by a cladding material with a lower index of refraction			0
when light tries to leave the core , it gets reflected back inward			0
solid optical fibers can only handle so much power , and they need physical support that may not be available where the cables need to go , such as the upper atmosphere			0
to solve these problems , professor @entity16 and his team have found a way to make air behave like an optical fibre , which could guide beams of light over long distances without loss of power , according to the study in the journal @entity141			1
the air waveguides consist of a ‘ wall ’ of low - density air surrounding a core of higher density air			1
just like a conventional optical fibre , the wall has a lower refractive index than the core , guiding light along a ‘ pipe ’			1
the physicists broke down the air with a laser to create a spark and used the air waveguide to conduct light from the spark to a detector a three feet ( 1 metre ) away			1
the signal was strong enough so that they could analyse the chemical composition of the air that produced the spark			0
in fact , the signal was one - and - a - half times stronger than a signal obtained without the waveguide			0
while this may not seem a lot , over distances that are 100 times longer - where an unguided signal would be severely weakened - the signal enhancement could be much greater , the scientists explained			0
the air waveguides were made using very short , powerful laser pulses			0
just like a conventional optical fibre ( pictured ) , the wall has a lower refractive index than the core , guiding light along a ' pipe ' a laser pulse transforms into a narrow beam called a filament , which happens because the laser light increases the refractive index of the air in the centre of the beam , as if the pulse is carrying its own lens with it			1

the physicists have previously showed that four filaments were fired in a square arrangement , produce holes forming the low - density wall needed for a waveguide			1
the ‘ pipe ’ produced by the filaments lasted a few milliseconds , a million times longer than the laser pulse , which for many laser applications is ‘ infinity , ’ professor @entity16 said			2
because the waveguides are relatively long - lived , he believes a single guide could be used to send out a laser can collect a signal			2
‘ it ’s like you could just take a physical optical fibre and unreel it at the speed of light , put it next to this thing that you want to measure remotely , and then have the signal come all the way back to where you are , ’ he said			1
the next step is for the scientists to show that the waveguides can be used over distances of at least 164ft ( 50 metres )			0
they could then be honed to conduct chemical analyses of places like the upper atmosphere or nuclear reactors , where it ’s difficult to get instruments close to what ’s being studied			0
the waveguides could also be used for @entity243 , a variation on radar that uses laser light instead of radio waves to make high - resolution topographic maps .			0

air waveguide could be used to **improve** light signals from distant sources
guide is a ‘ wall ’ of low - density air surrounding a core of higher density air
it works like an optical fibre , guiding beams of light over long distance
this could **improve** laser communications and help detect pollution in air
*technology* could also be used to communicate with colonies on @entity12
