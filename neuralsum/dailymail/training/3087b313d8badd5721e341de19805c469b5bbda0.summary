by @entity0 published : 21:01 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 05:15 est , 4 november 2013 aged only 60 minutes , @entity1 had suffered more than most people do in a lifetime			1
not only had her heart stopped beating for 25 minutes , she then needed surgery as doctors battled to save her			1
her parents , @entity8 and @entity9 , had earlier been warned she was unlikely to survive beyond 21 weeks in the womb			0
they were told that as well as having four major heart defects , their unborn child had a high risk of cystic fibrosis and @entity16 ’s syndrome			2
survivor : miracle baby @entity1 , aged seven - months , from @entity17 , @entity18 , died for 25 minutes before she was revived by doctors and underwent life - saving heart surgery - all before she was an hour old in hospital : @entity1 was just nine minutes old when her heart stopped beating			1
doctors worked for 25 minuted until they finally revived her despite the warnings , mrs @entity1 , from @entity17 , @entity18 , rejected advice to terminate her pregnancy and when @entity1 was delivered ‘ pink and screaming ’ a week early , the couple could not have been happier			1
however , only nine minutes later @entity1 ’s heart stopped			1
when doctors finally managed to revive her , she needed two heart operations – after 40 minutes of life and at eight days old – and a week of hypothermia treatment to reverse any brain damage			1
but having survived her gruelling start to life , @entity1 is a happy , smiling seven - month - old baby and taking on her next challenge – learning to crawl			1
mrs @entity1 , 23 , said : ‘ she ’s amazing , she ’s doing everything she should be doing for a seven - month - old			1
she ’s sitting up and rolling , quicker than her brothers did			0
and she does n’t have @entity16 ’s syndrome or cystic fibrosis			0
‘ at my 20 - week scan they gave me three weeks to decide whether to continue with the pregnancy			2
‘ they said she would n’t make it past 21 weeks in the womb			0
but i was n’t giving up on her , i decided to carry on			0
‘ every week were told the pros and cons but i ignored it , i knew she ’d be ok			0
and she ’s proved them all wrong			0
’ through a routine scan half - way through her pregnancy mrs @entity1 – who is also mother to @entity56 , four , and @entity57 , two – discovered that @entity1 ’s arteries were transposed			1
she also had two holes in her heart and narrowing of the pulmonary valves			2
traumatic : once doctors revived @entity1 , she needed to immediately undergo emergency heart surgery worth the wait : @entity8 , pictured left , and her husband @entity9 , pictured right , finally got to hold @entity1 when she was two weeks old the combination of these problems meant there was limited blood being pumped around her body or to the lungs			1
for the remainder of her pregnancy mrs @entity1 received growth scans and was told that @entity1 would weigh only about 4lb at birth			1
her delivery by caesarean section at the @entity80 in @entity81 on march 28 took more than two hours because of @entity1 ’s position			2
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ the surgeon actually lifted me off the operating table with the force needed to pull the baby out			1
’ but when @entity1 finally arrived she weighed in at a healthy 8lb 5oz			1
the plan was to transfer her to the @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity81 , within 24 hours			0
lucky to be alive : doctors had believed it was unlikely @entity1 would survive beyond 21 weeks in the womb mrs @entity1 recalled : ‘ when she came out she was pink and was screaming , but at nine minutes old her heart stopped and she passed away for 25 minutes			1
‘ the doctors came down and told us that things were n’t looking too good and she probably wo n’t make it			2
‘ i just sat there in shock			0
my mum and my husband sat there crying , but i just did n’t register what they were saying			0
’ doctors massaged the newborn ’s heart to try to keep the blood pumping and she was given five doses of adrenaline to re-start it			2
just as medics were on the verge of giving up , @entity1 ’s heart began to beat a minute after the final attempt to resuscitate her			2
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ they had been trying for so long that they said it would have been better to let her go			1
‘ but after 24 minutes they gave it one last attempt and she pulled through			0
’ minutes later , when she was only 40 minutes old , doctors carried out an emergency operation to keep the arteries in her heart open			2
her body temperature was cooled to 24c ( 75f ) in an attempt to reverse any brain damage as it had been starved of oxygen for so long			0
at eight days old she had a ten - hour open heart operation to correct her arteries , two holes in her heart and widen the pulmonary valves			2
her body temperature was gradually brought back up to the normal body temperature of 37c ( 98.6f )			0
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ after the operation we finally got to see her , although nothing prepared us for seeing our poor girl ’s chest wounds and dressings			1
‘ but a few days later she opened her eyes for the first time , aged two weeks , and i finally got to hold her			0
it was such an emotional day			0
’ proud family : mother @entity8 and her brothers @entity56 , four , pictured right , and @entity57 , two despite all that happened , mrs @entity1 said it was not until she got home that she cried : ‘ i stood there and broke down			1
’ she added : ‘ i never thought we ’d be looking forward to spending @entity154 with her			0
’ she added : ‘ to look at @entity156 you would n’t think she has been through everything that she has			0
she ‘ s as healthy as can be			0

@entity1 was just 60 minutes old when her heart stopped beating
doctors managed to revive her before carrying out two heart operations
the seven - month - old is now healthy and happy and learning to crawl
mrs @entity1 and her husband , a *29* - year - old *engineer* , are raising *funds* for @entity168 through @entity169
