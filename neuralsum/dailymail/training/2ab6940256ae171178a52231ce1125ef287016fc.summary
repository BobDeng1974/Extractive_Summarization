@entity10 was given just days to live after becoming the only boy in the world with two forms of cancer			1
but he has now baffled doctors by making a miraculous recovery @entity10 , pictured with comedian @entity20 , diagnosed with leukaemia aged ten and developed rare @entity12 two years later by day 46 they moved into a hospice to prepare for his death and even planned his funeral together			1
but two months later @entity10 is still alive and gaining strength - baffling doctors who thought they could do no more to save him			1
his mother @entity29 , 33 , also believes her son has drawn strength from the many celebrities who have backed his plight - including @entity34 , @entity20 and @entity35			2
the mother - of - two , who is now a full - time carer for her son , said : ' after the fourth transplant they told us it had failed - this was in the first week of december last year			1
' they told us that he would probably struggle to reach 40 days after the last transplant and that after 50 days we could forget it really			1
' when @entity10 reached day 46 , we were sent to a hospice to prepare for his death			2
' it got to the point where his funeral was planned - he ’d picked the music , the guests , the venue and the dress code			0
after undergoing four unsuccessful bone marrow transplants his parents were told the treatment had failed and he was unlikely to survive longer than 50 days ' we had all sat down together to plan it so that it would be how he wanted			1
i guess he wo n’t have to plan a funeral again though ! ' @entity10 , from @entity61 , @entity62 , was first diagnosed with leukaemia in july 2010 after his glands swelled and he lost his appetite			1
two years later , he was told he had @entity66 , one of only six people in the world with the condition			2
he was transferred to @entity71 last february for specialist treatment			0
his mother , and father , @entity34 , 34 , and nine - year - old brother @entity75 , moved into a house nearby , provided by a charity			0
by day 46 , @entity10 's family had moved into a hospice to prepare for his death and even planned his funeral he was given four bone marrow transplants - two of which were his own - in an attempt to beat the cancer			1
@entity10 , who was sick up to five times a day , would often ask his mother when the end would come			2
mrs @entity29 said : ' @entity10 had certainly accepted his death			2
it was n’t that he ’d given up but he ’d got to the point that he was ready to embrace it			0
' when someone gives up , they question what the point in living is			0
@entity10 was n’t like that - he was just very calm about it all			2
' @entity10 said to us : " when you finally accept your fate it is the best time of your life - you just accept it "			2
' ' he handled himself very well - he had prepared himself to not have a future			0
he had been so ill that he was looking forward to dying			0
@entity10 with @entity108 stars @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 during his fight with the disease			1
he was given four bone marrow transplants - two of which were his own - in an attempt to beat the cancer ' it was like telling your child you are going to @entity122 and then keep putting it off			1
' he kept asking when is it going to happen - he wanted to escape from everyone poking him all the time			0
he was sick of being dictated to			0
' but the better he is getting , the more positive he is about being alive			0
' the problem is now his future is a little uncertain again and that ’s something he did n’t like before - the unpredictability of it			0
' in december , after the treatment had apparently failed , his family were moved into @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity134 , and told they had to come to terms with losing @entity10			1
it is believed that his body has now started producing white blood cells to fight the cancerous cells - which doctors thought the fourth bone marrow transplant had failed to do			1
@entity10 with tv baker @entity35			2
the teenager 's mother says that as his treatment repeatedly failed , he became prepared for his death mrs @entity29 explained that doctors believed he would be able to make a full recovery , thanks to his latest bone marrow transplant			1
she explained that while @entity10 was ill , he needed continuous blood transfusions as the cancer prevented his body from producing the blood cells it needed			1
now he has not needed a blood transfusion for over six weeks			2
this means his final bone marrow transplant grafted , meaning his body has accepted the transplant and his bone marrow is now able to function properly			1
mrs @entity29 added that doctors are now preparing to remove the catheter in @entity10 's chest , a sign that they believe he will not need any further treatment			2
she said : ' on day 104 , after his transplant , doctors told us that @entity10 had officially grafted - despite the fact they said this was impossible after 50 days			1
' essentially , the bone marrow transplant is doing what it should be doing			1
his blood count is back up now - he has to have tests every week just to check it 's ok			0
but two months after it was estimated he may die , @entity10 is still alive and gaining strength - baffling doctors who thought they could do no more to save him			1
it is believed that his body has now started producing white blood cells to fight the cancerous cells ' obviously it still is n't quite where it should be but he has n't needed a blood transfusion for six weeks which tells us that his body is now able to produce its own blood cells			1
' the doctors have told us that they now see no reason that @entity10 should have to worry			1
' next friday he is booked in to have his central line ( skin - tunnelled venous catheter ) removed which is the doctors ' way of saying " it 's over "			0
' they certainly would n't be taking it out if they had any reason to believe he may be needing treatment again any time soon			0
' there will be no more drugs , no more blood transfusions and certainly no more chemotherapy			0
' for now , at least , we do n't need to worry			0
@entity10 ’s struggle has touched the hearts of many famous faces , including @entity34 and @entity205 , and he now claims to be best friends with funny - man @entity20			2
in november star baker @entity35 made his dreams come true by taking him for a spin in a £ 170,000 @entity210 supercar			0
@entity10 's mother @entity211 said : ' the doctors have told us they now see no reason that @entity10 should have to worry any more ' mrs @entity29 said : “ he has become friend with quite a few famous faces now - and many of them have still kept in touch , checking up on him which is so nice			1
' @entity20 is his best mate ! he would come and visit @entity220 about once a week when he was really poorly - he ’d bring him gifts to cheer him up , like dvds and stuff			0
' he has also met @entity34 and @entity224 actually facetimed him on his birthday and he quite often texts me to see how he ’s getting on which is very surreal			0
“ i think having celebrities supporting him has really helped him through - we ’re not a particularly wealthy and we ca n’t promise big holidays or anything			0
' having people like @entity234 around is great because he ’s been able to offering @entity10 things that we never could			2
' he ’s part of @entity20 ’s tour and he ’s been told he can have tickets to any of the shows			0
' things like that have really motivated him			0
they have given him something to look forward to , which is really special when you did n’t expect to have a future			0
' he can now start mapping a future out and getting back on his feet			0
