by @entity0 for @entity1 when @entity4 bounds onto the stage to belt out @entity8 classics in @entity9 tonight , her huge voice is sensational			1
watch the second part of @entity13 ’s outstanding @entity12 biopic and you ’ll see an actress who can do everything — comedy , drama and song , all at the same time			1
even the real @entity9 says she ’s envious of the performance — and over the weekend sent a bouquet of flowers to congratulate her			2
this is a star so gifted and glamorous that major names from director @entity25 and comedian @entity26 to @entity28 superstars @entity29 and @entity30 have pleaded to work with her			2
@entity32 and @entity33 count themselves among her fans			2
@entity4 is terrified that one day soon the world will declare her a fraud			1
‘ i spend most of my time feeling like i ’m totally blagging it through life , ’ she admits			1
‘ i did n’t go to drama school			2
and i honestly do feel out of my depth			2
‘ so i keep my head down			2
i do n’t want anybody to spot i ’m not a real actor			2
’ when she collected an @entity53 for best actress in 2011 , for her @entity55 starring role in @entity57 , she blurted : ‘ i do n’t think i deserve to be here			1
’ @entity4 in 2009 with her one - time co-star and lover @entity59 coming from other actresses , this might be just fishing for compliments			1
but the cracks in @entity4 ’s self - confidence go much deeper , affecting not only her career but also her private life			1
single since parting four years from her last acknowledged boyfriend , @entity67 — @entity69 ’s former lover — she admits that at 33 she has started to feel an urge for motherhood			1
but she can not believe that , after so long living alone , with a demanding job and a passion for her pets ( a pug called @entity77 , a @entity78 named @entity79 , and @entity80 , a @entity82 shar pei ) any man could want to share his life with her			2
‘ i ’ve become a crazy dog lady from @entity86 , ’ she frets			2
‘ what man wants to take on three dogs as well as me ? dogs are more loyal than men			2
and they ’re less trouble			2
i ’m happy with the dogs			2
’ she claims that attempts at dating over the years have been less than successful			2
one man turned up for dinner wearing socks and sandals ; another threw up drunkenly over her dress on the bus			0
not one of these dates amounted to much			0
there has been nothing to match her emotional two - year affair with her @entity108 co-star @entity59 , which was intense and draining			1
@entity4 has maintained a dignified silence about the trauma of their repeated break - ups , but @entity59 has been less coy			1
there were no half - measures in their life together , he says : it was always ‘ true love or deepest heartbreak ’			1
@entity4 with @entity119 at the ' the @entity121 ' play after party in 2013 ‘ she is an incredible actress , ’ he wrote in his autobiography			1
funny , and absolutely intoxicating to be around			0
i loved her more than i ever knew was possible			0
‘ each time we got back together the love would be more intense ; and then , of course , the break - up would be all the more heart - breaking			1
’ they finally split in 2009			1
sensitive , wary and unsure of herself , @entity4 may still be nursing wounds from this emotionally exhausting merry - ground of break - up and reconciliation			1
her lack of confidence seems at odds with her upbringing			0
she comes from a supportive and hugely affectionate family			0
when she was starring in @entity57 , her mother would organise buses to bring her friends and family to see the show			1
these were riotous excursions with everyone dressed in high heels and feather boas			0
her parents , @entity154 and @entity155 , work as a country ’ n ’ western duo called the @entity157 , and from the age of four @entity4 was singing on stage in the local clubs with them , standing on a stool so the audience could see her			1
even today , there ’s nothing she enjoys more than an impromptu song with her family			0
while filming @entity9 in @entity39 earlier this year , she joined her brother @entity169 ’s band , the torn , at a pub in @entity39 ’s @entity172 , to belt out a @entity174 classic , @entity175			0
there was , however , heartbreak in this otherwise happy , noisy childhood			0
her other brother @entity179 , ten years her senior , died from cancer when she was just eight			0
@entity4 has a tattoo on the inside of her wrist in his memory — a pair of angel wings with a halo			1
the actress admits she finds the tragedy hard to talk about , but she has just finished filming @entity191 , a drama celebrating the life of her friend @entity193 , who died last year after a five - year battle with breast cancer			1
the role required her to shave her head — and , typically , she seized the opportunity to do something unpredictable			1
a week before she was due to go bald , she dyed it green , blue , pink and then purple — and turned up to the @entity203 with a lurid mohawk			0
sheridan in character as @entity9 with @entity207 as @entity208 , @entity209 as @entity210 and @entity211 as @entity212 sheridan at the @entity203 in 2013 with her mother @entity154 who has been very supportive of her career she called it ‘ liberating … i can enjoy all the different styles it will go through before i ’m back to being me ’			1
this clash of extroversion and insecurity lies behind everything she does			0
even before she reached her teens , her talent was obvious			0
she went to dance classes near her home in @entity228 , @entity229 — ‘ right bang between @entity231 and @entity232 ’			0
her secondary school drama teacher urged her apply to the @entity234 , which led to her first major part , in the musical @entity236			0
she was @entity237 , the gangster ’s moll played by @entity240 in the movie			0
in 1997 , aged 16 , she moved to @entity242 , sharing a two - bedroom flat with five other young actors and singers			1
she collected an @entity53 for best actress in 2011 , for her @entity55 starring role in @entity57 one of @entity4 ’s first jobs was at the prestigious @entity249 , in the @entity251 musical @entity250 playing @entity252			1
@entity253 , later the star of @entity254 , played the @entity255			0
@entity4 admitted that until she turned up at the theatre for rehearsals , she ’d imagined the show would take place in a real warehouse			1
it was an understandable mistake from a no - nonsense @entity263 lass who thought ‘ @entity265 ’ stood for ‘ @entity265 ’ rather than ‘ @entity266 ’			1
with a fake tan and extensions plaited into her hair , she played @entity271 ’s ( actor @entity119 ) girlfriend in the @entity273 sitcom @entity274			0
an eight - year stint in the raucous comedy @entity277 followed , also with @entity119 , who became a long - term friend			1
she began to fear she had been typecast , condemned to play ‘ scrubs , chavs or slappers ’ in sitcoms such as @entity280 and @entity108 , in which she played @entity59 ’s gobby , tracksuit - wearing younger sister			1
but her career took a sudden upward swing with the @entity55 smash @entity57 — as @entity288 , the madcap peroxide blonde who amazes everyone by becoming a top lawyer			1
the demands of the role looked impossible , with 18 musical numbers and a frenetic plot			1
but @entity4 handled it with consummate brilliance			1
two phrases cropped up again and again in the ecstatic reviews — ‘ a star is born ’ and ‘ much better than @entity302 in the film ’			0
this success alerted @entity25 to her talent			0
he cast her in @entity307 ’s wartime weepie , @entity306 , at the @entity308 in 2011 , and sensational reviews followed			2
one night @entity30 came backstage and reduced her to tears of disbelief with his praise			0
to prove these were not empty words , he cast her in his first film as a director , quartet , with @entity32 , @entity318 and @entity33			0
she went on to do @entity319 at the @entity320 , encouraged by the theatre ’s artistic director @entity29 , and starred as @entity322 in @entity323 opposite @entity26 as @entity324			0
@entity4 lost her older brother to cancer when she was just eight years old			1
she recently shaved her head to film @entity191 , a drama celebrating the life of her friend @entity193 , who died last year after a five - year battle with breast cancer yet she is still crippled by self - doubt			2
following an appearance on @entity336 ’s chat show where he ambushed her with a family video of her on stage singing at nine years old , she tweeted : ‘ oh i ca n’t stop crying			0
hate myself sometimes , just ca n’t be myself			0
i can only play characters			0
wish i had more confidence when i ’m being me			0
’ she has collected shelfloads of awards , including two oliviers and a @entity203			2
the acclaim seems to do nothing for her confidence , however			0
when she was presented with an honorary doctorate from the @entity348 , she said : ‘ i ’m thrilled — but i left school when i was 16 , and all the graduates here today have worked so hard and thoroughly deserve their degrees			0
they make me feel a bit of a fraud			0
’ perhaps one day @entity4 will learn to trust the judgment of others			1
in the meantime — though she might not believe it — the whole country thinks she ’s just fabulous .			0
