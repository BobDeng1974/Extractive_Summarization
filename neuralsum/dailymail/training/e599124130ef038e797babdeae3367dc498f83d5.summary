today we call them ' trolls ' but in 1911 , ground - breaking physicist @entity3 coined a different term for relentless critics : ' reptiles			2
' in a newly unearthed letter he wrote to fellow - physicist @entity8 , mr @entity3 urged his friend to ignore a series of scandalous rumors concerning her heritage and her love life which were circling her at the time			1
' if the rabble continues to occupy itself with you , then simply do n't read that hogwash , but rather leave it to the reptile for whom it has been fabricated , ' mr @entity3 , then 32 , wrote on november 23 , 1911			0
ignore the trolls : in a newly unearthed letter @entity3 ( left ) wrote to fellow - physicist @entity8 ( right ) , mr @entity3 urged his friend to ignore a series of scandalous rumors that were circling her at the time astrobiologist @entity26 found the letter in a newly - released archive published by @entity29			1
at the time , mrs @entity8 , the first women to win a @entity31 and a then - 38 - year - old widow , was being hounded by accusations not only that she was @entity34 , and thus undeserving of a position at the @entity36 , but also that she was having an affair with a married man			1
the former rumor was false , and the latter turned out to be true			0
in 1911 , mrs @entity8 , based in @entity41 with her two daughters , was competing against 66 - year - old @entity43 for a physicist seat at the esteemed @entity36			1
right - wring @entity46 newspaper @entity45 was among those who attacked her candidacy , asking incredulously in one headline ' will a woman enter the institute ? ' and claiming she was secretly jewish based on ' scientific ' analysis of her facial characteristics and handwriting			0
that autumn , amid the media storm , mrs @entity8 joined mr @entity3 as the only woman at an international physics conference in the @entity59 capital of @entity60			2
@entity62 words : astrobiologist @entity26 found the letter ( pictured ) in a newly - released archive published by @entity29 in mr @entity3 's subsequent november letter to @entity66 , he wrote : ' i am impelled to tell you how much i have come to admire your intellect , your drive , and your honesty , and that i consider myself lucky to have made your personal acquaintance in @entity60			1
' when mrs @entity8 arrived back in @entity41 , even more accusations had built against her ; this time in regards to her relationship with fellow physicist @entity77 , who was married but estranged from his wife			2
the @entity46 press got their hands on intimate letters exchanged between ms @entity8 and mr @entity77 , and promptly declared her a home - wrecker , according to the @entity84			1
' on her return to @entity46 , mrs @entity8 discovered an angry mob congregated in front of her home in @entity89 , terrorizing 14 - year - old @entity90 and seven - year - old eve			1
' @entity66 and her daughters had to take refuge in the home of friends in @entity41 , ' the site states			0
mr @entity3 's letter in response to the scandal begins : ' do not laugh at me for writing you without having anything sensible to say			0
' but i am so enraged by the base manner in which the public is presently daring to concern itself with you that i absolutely must give vent to this feeling			0
' mr @entity3 goes on to presume that mrs @entity8 probably ' despise [ s ] this rabble ' and blasts the rumor - mills and their ' lust for sensationalism			1
' he then refers directly to her relationship with mr @entity77 and states he is ' happy ' to have mrs @entity8 and mr @entity77 as ' personages ' , describing them as : ' real people with whom one feels privileged to be in contact			2
' laugh it off : in 1911 , mrs @entity8 ( right ) was facing scandalous rumors that she was secretly @entity34 and a home - wrecker , accusations that led mr @entity3 ( left ) to ' vent ' his disapproval although ms @entity8 did n't get her seat at the @entity36 , she was awarded the @entity124 that very same year			1
it was her second win , having won the @entity126 in 1903			0
when members of the @entity129 wrote to mrs @entity8 to dissuade her from coming to @entity130 to accept her 1911 @entity124 based on her bad press , the plucky scientist responded : ' the prize has been awarded for the discovery of radium and polonium ... i can not accept that the appreciation of the value of scientific work should be influenced by libel and slander concerning private life			2
' mrs @entity8 died in 1934 at the age of 66 from aplastic anemia , which was believed to have been contracted from her long - term exposure to radiation			2
in a 2009 poll carried out by @entity148 , she was voted the ' most inspirational woman in science			0
' mr @entity3 , who developed the general theory of relativity in 1916 and won the @entity126 in 1921 , was famed for his outspoken manner , and his letter to mrs @entity8 was characteristic of this approach			1
he died in 1955 at the age of 76 and left a long legacy of wise - cracking wisdom			0
' only two things are infinite , ' he once said			0
' the universe and human stupidity , and i 'm not sure about the former			0

in 1911 , physicist @entity8 was facing scandalous rumors that she was secretly @entity34 and a home - wrecker
