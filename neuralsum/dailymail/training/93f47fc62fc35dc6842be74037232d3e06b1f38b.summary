somebody has to win the @entity1			1
that 's the message from @entity3 running back @entity4 as the 2 - 5 @entity5 prepare for their clash with the @entity7 at @entity8 on sunday			1
@entity9 are not the only team struggling in that division			1
the @entity12 currently lead the way on 3 - 3 - 1 with the @entity14 ( 2 - 4 ) in second , the @entity5 third and the @entity15 ( 1 - 5 ) fourth			2
' we are only seven weeks in , ' @entity4 told @entity17			2
' if somebody goes on a winning streak and wins their next nine games , they have a winning record			0
it is all about the team who are going to rectify their wrongs and go and take the division			0
we feel in @entity3 , why not us because someone has to win the division			0
' @entity4 ( left ) thinks the @entity5 can still claw their way back into contention in the @entity1 @entity4 at an event at @entity34 on tuesday as if injury problems with their offensive line were n't enough to deal with , the @entity5 will come up against the best defense in the league on sunday against the @entity7			1
@entity7 enter the game in a different place - 5 - 2 atop the @entity40 having just pulled off a thrilling 24 - 23 win over the @entity14			2
@entity4 said : ' @entity7 have had a very good first half of the season			2
their skill players are some of the best in the @entity47 along with a very tenacious , nasty defense led by @entity49			0
' it is unfortunate that a lot of my team mates have been injured			0
the offensive line has been decimated by injuries			1
typically your offensive line is the nucleus of the team			1
they are the backbone , the big , tough guys who protect everyone around them and allow the smaller , skilled athletes to do their job well			0
' when you have so many injuries and then change up with guys trying to get not only used to each other and build that chemistry together but a game plan as well , it can be really challenging in the middle of a season			0
' the @entity5 landed at @entity76 on monday morning and will begin their practice for the week at @entity80 's @entity79 base on wednesday			1
the foreign country and different environment may have an effect on some of the younger players in the league , but @entity4 is experienced enough to be able to deal with the demands of playing a regular - season game in @entity79 and the distractions that may bring to a business trip			1
@entity4 ( second from left ) joined @entity90 ( second from right ) and @entity92 on stage at @entity34 the @entity5 cheerleaders make an appearance at @entity97 ' clash with @entity98 at @entity99 but , even as an experienced traveller , @entity4 admitted it would be tough for players if the @entity47 moves a franchise to @entity79			1
he said : ' personally i know the difference between taking care of business and doing my part as an individual and i know how to balance the two			0
it would be harder for the younger guys			0
' outside of @entity113 , @entity112 is the only other place where i see that it really makes sense to introduce a new franchise			0
' the @entity47 season is grueling on it 's own so to have 10 or 12 - hour flights would be really challenging on certain teams			2
the @entity79 based team may have to be away from home for two or three weeks at a time and it could be quite a disadvantage			0
@entity90 , @entity4 and @entity92 were at @entity79 as part of the ' suit up for sunday ' campaign and ahead of the second 2014 @entity128 game			1
this sunday the @entity5 will take on the @entity7 at @entity8			1
