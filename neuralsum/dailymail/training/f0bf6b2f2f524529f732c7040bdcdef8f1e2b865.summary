a @entity1 tailor who survived the @entity2 has revealed how he came inches away from assassinating a senior @entity5 's wife - but his conscience saved him from stooping to the level of the @entity8 @entity9 , 84 , is a @entity11 - based tailor to the rich and famous who has been altering suits for decades , with a host of celebrity clients from the music , sports and political arenas			1
it was a life he never saw coming seven decades ago , when he was locked up in @entity21 prison camp , doubting he would make it past the age of 16			2
and in his new memoir @entity24 , @entity9 describes the harrowing day that he was freed - and debated seeking bloody revenge on his torturers			1
instead , he leapt in her black @entity38 , invited two @entity41 girls to join him , and drove gleefully through the gates of the defunct camp under the then ironic sign : ' to each what he deserves '			0
months before , he had been doing repairs at @entity21 when he came across a broken chicken pen , and to his surprise found a pair of rabbits still alive quivering inside			0
next to them , a starving @entity9 noticed some browning lettuce the two pets had left			1
he started to eat it - and was caught by the mayor or @entity36 's wife , who ordered for him to be beaten			1
watch the full interview with @entity9 at @entity58 survivor : he was released from @entity59 and headed straight to the home of the mayor 's wife ' i could n't do it ' : he pointed the gun at the woman 's chest as she held a baby but his conscience kicked in instead , he took her @entity38 and drove it - with two @entity41 girls - through the gates of @entity21 her cruelty struck a nerve			1
he writes : ' how could a woman carrying her own child find a walking skeleton saving her pets and have him beaten for nibbling on rotten animal food ? i thought			2
' in that moment , my numbness to death melted			0
in its place rose an alien blood lust , a hunger for vengeance unlike any i had ever known			0
the surge of adrenaline and rush of rage felt good inside my withered frame			0
' then and there i made a vow to myself : if i survived @entity21 , i would return and kill the mayor ’s wife			1
' at 3.15pm on april 11 , 1945 , he set out to fulfill his vow			0
he grabbed machine guns and two sidekicks and headed straight for the mayor 's home			1
' the beautiful blond woman turned the corner and let out a screech			0
she had the baby in her arms again , ' @entity9 recounts in an exclusive extract published by the @entity107			1
' i aimed the machine gun at her chest			1
my finger hovered above the trigger			2
' but when the moment came , he could n't			2
' that was the moment i became human again			0
all the old teachings came rushing back			0
i had been raised to believe that life was a precious gift from @entity121 , that women and children must be protected			0
' a traumatic history : @entity9 recounts his incredible journey to become a @entity11 tailor he added : ' my moral upbringing would not allow me to become an honorary member of the @entity8 ' instead , clad in uniform , he grabbed the car , two girls , and carted into his former prison			1
it was a moment that allowed @entity9 to reconquer his life and move to the @entity135 , he explains			1
the first shirt he ever touched with a needle and thread belonged to an @entity8 guard who had given it to him to wash			2
honing his sewing skills and fixing the attire to fit him properly , mr @entity9 used the shirt as a status symbol , wearing it in place of his prison garb			2
he had been moved to the @entity21 camp before he was freed by allied forces			0
when freed , he was alongside another young prisoner , writer @entity149 winner @entity148			0
mr @entity9 was 19 years old when he arrived in the @entity135 in 1947			2
today , he is showing few signs that he is ready to retire			0
the @entity107 reported that suits at @entity9 ’s @entity1 headquarters cost anywhere from $ 1,800 to $ 2,700			2
in the past , mr @entity9 ’s prowess as a tailor has been sought out by some of @entity135 ’s biggest names , including @entity159 and @entity160			1
but perhaps no name is bigger than the president of the @entity135			0
as a young tailor in the 50s , his bosses gave him the privilege to measure @entity167 , the same man who shook his hand as a general outside the liberated @entity21 camp years earlier			0
@entity167 may have been mr @entity9 ’s first president , but he would n’t be the last , as @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 also bought suits from him , according to the @entity175			1
memories : his factory walls are decked with pictures of his famous clients and awards he has won he had an appointment with president @entity182 at the @entity183 on september 11 , 2001 - a meeting that had to be rescheduled after the terror attacks			0
president @entity186 is likely among mr @entity9 ’s clientele as well , but the humble tailor will not say so , citing a personal policy not to speak about a client unless that client has first spoken of him			1
other clients include other key political figures as gen @entity194 , @entity196 @entity195 and @entity11 mayor @entity197 .			1

@entity9 , 84 , was ordered to be beaten by mayor of @entity36 's wife
when he was freed , aged 16 , he went to her house with machine guns
pointed gun at her chest as she held a baby , could n't pull the trigger
' my conscience would n't let me become honorary @entity8 member , ' he says
he is now a tailor to the stars in @entity11 , dresses the president
