atrial fibrillation — an erratic heartbeat — affects up to 800,000 @entity2 , and can lead to a stroke if left untreated			1
@entity4 , 67 , a retired insurance worker from @entity5 , @entity6 , underwent a new procedure for it			1
the patient ' even after a nap i ’d feel drained of energy , ' said @entity4 four years ago , i noticed i was feeling increasingly tired			1
even after a nap i ’d feel drained of energy			2
after four months i saw my gp who did several blood tests , but each came back normal			2
then in november 2013 , i had a health assessment before surgery for arthritis in my hand — this involved having an electrocardiogram to record my heart ’s electrical activity			1
apparently , they do this for the over- 60s to check your heart is ok and it ’s therefore safe to operate			1
the next day , the hospital advised me to see my gp , who said my operation was being postponed because my heart was beating very fast			1
i was prescribed beta - blockers to slow my heartbeat , but i had to stop taking them as it swung too far the other way and got down to just 30 beats a minute ( 60 to 100 is normal )			2
other pills did n’t help either and i still felt incredibly tired			2
eventually , my gp referred me to @entity44 ’s cardiology department			2
a year ago , i was put on a heart monitor for three days and was later diagnosed with atrial fibrillation ( @entity47 ) — the extreme tiredness i ’d been suffering was a typical symptom			1
i was told that normally your heart contracts and relaxes to a regular beat			1
but with this condition , random electrical pulses fire off from veins around the heart , so the upper chambers beat irregularly or quiver			1
this meant my heart had to pump extra hard to get oxygen - rich blood around my body , which explained the tiredness			1
it could also put me at risk of blood clots and stroke , so i started taking the blood thinner warfarin			2
the heart monitor had shown that my heart was quivering ( ‘ fibrillating ’ ) at certain times of the day ; in between it would return to normal			1
this narrowed the range of suitable treatments			2
' after a week , the fatigue lifted ... now i ’m enjoying life , ' said @entity4 given that drugs had been unsuccessful , my cardiologist suggested i had catheter ablation , where they use a wire to burn away the areas of heart tissue triggering rogue electrical pulses			1
in june , i was referred to cardiologist professor @entity84 at @entity85 in @entity86			0
he told me about a new technique : instead of burning the affected tissue , he ’d freeze it with a special balloon			1
this would be faster and more successful at stopping the rogue signals getting to my heart			1
the procedure would take an hour and not involve a general anaesthetic			0
i had the procedure in july			0
i arrived at the hospital early in the morning , was given a local anaesthetic and sedated , and was discharged by 2pm			0
i ’d been warned about bruising in the groin as this is where the tube attached to the balloon is inserted — but i had no side - effects at all			0
after a week , the fatigue lifted			0
i still take warfarin as a precaution against blood clots and keep an eye on my pulse			0
but now i ’m enjoying life , such as travelling with my husband @entity111			0
the surgeon @entity84 is a professor of cardiology and electrophysiology at @entity85			0
atrial fibrillation causes an irregular and often very fast heart rate			1
the heart ’s natural pacemaker — called the sinus node , an area of cells in the upper right chamber , or atrium — is over-ridden by abnormal electrical impulses fired off by the four pulmonary veins , which drain oxygenated blood from the lungs into the left atrium			1
these ‘ rogue ’ signals cause the heart ’s two upper chambers , the atria , to contract randomly and at a rate of up to 200 times a minute			1
this means that oxygenated blood is not pumped properly but pools in the heart , causing palpitations , dizziness , breathlessness and fatigue			1
doctors start newly diagnosed patients on drugs to regulate the heartbeat			2
we can also do cardio - version , where electric shock treatment resets the heart to a normal rhythm			2
but this does n’t tackle the underlying cause and is n’t suitable for patients such as @entity4 — her @entity47 was intermittent and the heart would reset itself			1
@entity157 therapy : a tiny balloon filled with gas is super-cooled to minus 75c			0
the balloon freezes a perfect ring of scar tissue around each pulmonary vein , so there are no gaps doctors can also ‘ burn ’ the tissue around the pulmonary veins , usually with catheter ablation — where a wire with an electrode on the end is threaded up to the heart via an incision in the groin			1
it burns a ring of dots around the source of the faulty signal , forming scar tissue , which blocks the signal			0
however , 40 per cent of these treatments need to be redone — tiny gaps can remain between the burns , causing some signals to get through , or the scar tissue may repair itself			0
@entity157 therapy gets round this problem			0
a tiny balloon filled with gas is super-cooled to minus 75c			0
the balloon freezes a perfect ring of scar tissue around each pulmonary vein , so there are no gaps			0
i ’ve been conducting a clinical trial that shows the cryoballoon is quicker to perform than conventional ablation because it forms the ring of scar tissue in one go , rather than being burnt away bit by bit			1
the cryoballoon has been available on the @entity203 for six years , but we ’ve been performing a streamlined version for six months			2
i ’ve cut the procedure time from three hours and an overnight hospital stay to one hour , with the patient going home that day			0
symptoms cease in up to 80 per cent of patients and if this treatment is still working after three months , it ’s likely to remain effective — and the scar tissue is less likely to recover , though it ’s unclear why			0
there ’s also less trauma to the tissue , partly because catheter ablation uses radio waves which convert to heat , which is more damaging			2
this procedure is ideal for people like @entity4 with intermittent atrial fibrillation and for whom drugs do n’t work			1
the earlier you treat people with intermittent @entity47 , the more chance you have of preventing their condition becoming persistent			1
first , we make two tiny punctures in the femoral vein at the top of the leg on the right side of the groin			0
through one , we insert a wire to stimulate the nerve supplying the diaphragm — if it ’s twitching , we know it is n’t being damaged during the freezing			0
through the second hole , we insert a long tube — a catheter — and thread it into the left atrium , which is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood around the body			0
at the end of the tube is a 10mm long balloon			0
we pump nitrous oxide into the balloon , which inflates to 28mm in volume and freezes to minus 75c			0
we position the inflated balloon inside the entrance of one of the pulmonary veins			0
the freezing surface of this balloon sticks to the rogue tissue causing the atrial fibrillation			1
we hold it in place for four minutes while it creates a 1mm diameter unbroken circle of scar tissue			0
we repeat the process at the entrance of all four pulmonary veins to prevent the rogue signals entering the heart			2
patients go home after four hours ’ bed rest			0
the cryoballoon is a step forward in the treatment of atrial fibrillation			1
as more of these procedures can be performed in a day , it could shorten waiting lists			0
@entity286 ? as patients with atrial fibrillation take anti-clotting drugs , they are more prone to bruising from the surgery			1
there is also a rare chance of the procedure damaging the gullet , though this risk is lower than with catheter ablation			2
dr @entity298 , a consultant cardiologist and electrophysiologist at the @entity300 , says : ‘ there has been a revolution in the treatment of @entity47 and for many patients it is curable			1
‘ of course , we do need to see the results of this study , but the hope is this procedure will increase first - time success , which will be good news for patients			0
’ the operation costs £ 6,000 on the @entity203 and £ 9,000 privately .			0

@entity4 was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation ( @entity47 )
@entity47 causes an irregular and often very fast heart rate
new technique , cryoballoon , is quicker to perform than conventional ablation
