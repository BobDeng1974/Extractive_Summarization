the @entity1 has lost two years worth of emails to and from embattled former tax official @entity3 , the agency told congressional investigators on friday			1
the @entity1 promised on may 8 to turn over all her emails but now blames a computer crash for huge tranches of missing documents			1
@entity3 is under investigation for allegedly orchestrating a years - long program that targeted tea party groups and other conservative organizations for unusually intrusive scrutiny when they applied for tax - exempt status beginning in the year before the 2010 congressional midterm elections			1
the @entity17 , one of two bodies probing the case , said friday that the @entity1 says that for the period of january 2009 through april 2011 , the only @entity3 emails it can find are those that were sent to or from other @entity1 employees			1
emails whose sender or recipient was outside the government , or inside other agencies , have mysteriously disappeared			0
those include the @entity31 , the @entity32 , the @entity33 and @entity35 congressional offices			0
former @entity1 official @entity3 ( c ) exercised her @entity36 right not to testify about her role in a scheme to target conservative nonprofit groups , but @entity40 held her in contempt of @entity42 and subpoenaed her emails -- which have now gone missing are you kidding me ? rep. @entity45 , the chair of the @entity17 , said friday that he would find it hard to believe the @entity1 moving forward @entity17 chairman @entity45 , a @entity47 @entity40 , said friday that ' the fact that i am just learning about this , over a year into the investigation , is completely unacceptable			1
' ' he also said the claim ' calls into question the credibility of the @entity1 ’s response to congressional inquiries			0
' @entity45 pointed a finger at @entity1 commissioner @entity57 , who pledged in a march 26 hearing to produce every document the agency had which might be related to the scandal			2
' it appears now that was an empty promise , ' @entity45 said , complaining that without emails between @entity3 and government officials outside the @entity1 , ' we are conveniently left to believe that @entity3 acted alone			2
' republicans in @entity42 have charged that @entity69 administration officials were part of a conspiracy to hamstring tea party groups in 2010 and beyond , since denying or delaying their tax - exemption applications prevented them from raising money during the years when their influence was at its highest			1
hundreds of the right - wing organizations were forced to wait more than three years for action on their applications , while politically liberal groups were typically approved quickly			2
in one case @entity3 , then in charge of the @entity1 's @entity82 , personally signed the approval granting tax - exempt status to the @entity86 , a charity headed by the president ’s half - brother			1
that approval was granted in less than a month , and back - dated – a highly unusual move – to allow the charity to avoid paying taxes on money it had raised prior to applying			0
are the ' @entity3 emails ' the new ' nixon tapes ' ? conservatives are crying cover - up as the @entity1 claims it has lost years worth of emails between @entity3 and government officials outside her agency @entity42 held @entity3 in contempt this year following her refusal in 2013 and 2014 to obey a subpoena and testify in an open hearing			1
she had invoked her @entity36 protections against self - incrimination , but after reading a lengthy statement absolving herself of any wrongdoing			0
the @entity1 said friday that it is producing 67,000 emails written by and to @entity3 between 2009 and 2013			2
' the @entity1 is committed to working with @entity42 , ' the agency said in a statement			0
' the @entity1 has remained focused on being thorough and responding as quickly as possible to the wide - ranging requests from @entity42 while taking steps to protect underlying taxpayer information			0
' @entity114 @entity40 @entity113 is n't buying it			0
' is n't it convenient for the @entity69 administration ? ' the chairman of the @entity118 said in a statement			0
' do they really expect the @entity122 people to believe that , after having withheld these emails for a year , they 're just now realizing the most critical time period is missing ? ' ' the supposed loss of @entity3 ’s emails further blows a hole in the credibility of claims that the @entity1 is complying with congressional requests , ' his statement barked , ' and their repeated assurances that they ’re working to get to the truth			1
' ' if there was n't nefarious conduct that went much higher than @entity3 in the @entity1 targeting scandal , why are they playing these games ? ' @entity140 , co-founder of @entity141 , said late on friday that the @entity1 's claim ' does n’t pass the smell test and smacks of obstruction of justice			1
' ' how is it that so many emails were simply " lost ? " why was there no data backup ? ' she asked			0
@entity40 senator @entity151 , the ranking @entity40 on the @entity152 , said the @entity1 's failure to produce all of @entity3 's emails would be ' an outrageous impediment to our investigation			1
' @entity158 , the anti-tax - hike group helmed by @entity160 - era conservative warrior @entity159 , went further still – drawing a parallel to the @entity163 administration			1
resurgence : tea party conservatives , once thought to be on the wane , had something to crow about on tuesday when economics professor @entity168 defeated @entity31 majority leader @entity169 in a primary race blowout tea party back on the rise : the conservative movement hamstrung for years by an allegedly nefarious @entity1 is back on the upswing with @entity168 's recent @entity40 primary victory in @entity177 ' this is the worst attempt to blame technology in service of a cover - up since the infamous " 18 - minute gap " during the @entity184 crisis , ' @entity159 said friday			1
' only in this case the gap is not 18 minutes , but two years			2
this cover - up is far worse			0
' president @entity163 's loyal secretary @entity187 claimed in 1973 that she caused the infamous ' gap ' in recordings of a june 20 , 1972 @entity191 meeting when she held down the wrong button on a tape recorded while answering a phone call			2
demonstrating later how this might have happened , @entity187 showed reporters how she claimed to have operated unrelated telephone and tape - recorder controls located several feet apart , contorting her limbs in what journalists mockingly called ' the ' @entity187			0
' democrats at the time alleged that the erasure was a deliberate attempt to erase part of a conversation between @entity163 and @entity31 chief of staff @entity209 about a break - in at the @entity212 headquarters			0
@entity31 lawyers did n't turn the tapes over to federal judge @entity215 , who had subpoenaed them , until a week after they first knew the gap existed			0
under a cloud of suspicion and facing unrelenting questions about his involvement in the break - in , @entity163 resigned less than a year later .			2

more than a year after receiving a subpoena , the @entity1 says there 's a *28* - month period where @entity3 's emails to and from people outside the @entity1 no longer exist
the agency blames a computer crash for the loss
@entity3 , formerly the *director* of the @entity1 *subagency* that awards tax exemptions to nonprofit groups , is accused of playing political *favorites*
she allegedly led a conspiracy to cripple conservative groups by slow - *walking* or denying their applications for tax - exempt status , which is *crucial* for *fundraising*
conservatives hit the roof on friday , with one group drawing a *comparison* with the famous 18 minutes of missing audio on *watergate* - era tapes of @entity163 's daily @entity191 meetings
