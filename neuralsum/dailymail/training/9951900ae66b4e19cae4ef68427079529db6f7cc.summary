a four - month old baby was kicked off a @entity2 cruise ship after falling ill after medical staff told her parents that she should n't be on the trip anyway because of her age			1
@entity7 was on a @entity8 to the @entity10 voyage with her husband @entity11 and baby as part of a 31 - strong group enjoying a holiday for an elder family member with terminal illness			1
however two days into the trip , mrs @entity7 's four - month - old baby fell ill , and was taken to see the ship 's doctor			1
@entity7 , her husband @entity11 and their four - month - old baby were told to leave the @entity2 cruise ship the baby was administered medication , however a couple of hours later the family were contacted my medical staff to be told that the four - month - old would have to be taken off the ship			1
in the summer , the minimum age of passengers on board @entity34 was raised from 12 weeks to six months , however the company said existing bookings would be honoured if the ages did n't fit in with the new rules			0
the @entity39 , from @entity40 , @entity8 , claim they were told by medical staff , however , that the decision had been taken because of the baby 's age , and that it would be safer to visit a hospital			2
the family were put up in sub-standard accommodation in @entity48 , where the three had to share this bed mr and mrs @entity7 were allegedly told their four - month - old baby was too young to be on the @entity2 cruise speaking to @entity54 , mrs @entity7 said : ' he ( medical staff ) said because of her age , she was n't supposed to be on the ship and that they would be — i think the word that he used was ' terminating ' our stay on the ship			1
' while the family were confused as to why the baby 's age had been raised as a factor despite being told it would n't come into play , what followed in terms of a contingency plan from @entity2 caused them a great deal of distress			2
having paid almost £ 700 ( $ 1,000 ) a night for the cruise , the family were checked into a hotel in @entity48 , that the father described as a ' fleabag motel			0
' worryingly the parents were forced take their baby into bed with them as there was nowhere else for the infant to sleep			0
this came after having to plead for a child car seat on the journey there			0
after being told they must leave the ship , the standard of provision the @entity7 's received was not up to scratch mrs @entity7 's father , @entity95 , who disembarked along with his sick grandaughter added : ' no one can believe that @entity2 would send a four - month - old baby off into the dark in a foreign country that they say in their brochures is dangerous			1
' however , @entity2 refute the suggestion that the child 's age was a reason , telling @entity106 that ' the child was not removed due to her age but because the on - board doctor felt the child needed medical care at a land - based hospital			2
' after checking in to a @entity10 hospital , the baby was merely diagnosed as having wind , yet the @entity39 were left with a £ 1,200 medical bill			0
the family added that they have been left upset with @entity2 's handling of the situation , and are yet to receive an apology			0
@entity122 have contacted @entity2 and are awaiting a response .			0

@entity7 and @entity125 had booked as part of a 31 - strong group
@entity129 was from @entity8 to the @entity10 for a terminally ill family member
couple 's four - month - old baby fell ill two days into the trip
mrs @entity7 told by staff that baby ' was n't supposed to be on the ship '
but family had been told age would n't be an issue before setting out
family upset with @entity2 's contingency plans for dealing with situation
@entity2 refute suggestion that baby 's age was issue , saying *importance* of hospital treatment was reasoning
