by @entity0 @entity2 tourists abroad have long been described as sunburned , drunk and wearing questionable footwear			0
and a survey today confirms this traditional stereotype - as the @entity9 , @entity4 and @entity5 all agree that @entity2 travellers were the heaviest drinkers on holiday			1
however , the @entity14 ' sense of humour and open - mindedness made up for their red shoulders and debateable sense of fashion , according to @entity20			0
fun - loving party spirit : @entity2 travellers were said to be the heaviest drinkers on holiday but also the ones with the best sense of humour the online travel agency asked people in the four @entity30 nations what they thought of stereotypes about themselves and tourists from the other four countries			0
@entity35 , @entity36 managing director , said : ' luckily for us @entity14 , our world - famous sense of humour continues to be our saving grace on foreign shores			0
' our fun - loving party spirit also came out in the feedback from other nations , but perhaps a little restraint with the sangria and sunshine is called for , as well as a little more care in our appearance when hitting the beach ! ' stereotypes : @entity5 tourists were described as helpful , while @entity2 travellers as sunburned more than half of the @entity5 polled said @entity2 were the least generous on holiday , while the other @entity30 travellers seem to perceive the @entity4 as ' pushy ' , ' demanding ' and ' beer drinkers ' when abroad			1
overall , @entity5 tourists were voted by the other three countries as the most likeable , topping the lists for being the most corteous , generous , friendly and helpful			0
