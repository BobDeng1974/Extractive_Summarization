by @entity0 drivers using their cellphones at the wheel does not affect the number of crashes , according to the results of a recent study			2
researchers at the @entity9 looked at more than a million accidents over six years on highways in @entity12 and found that a state ban had not reduced the number of collisions			1
the researchers chose a window of six months before and after the ban to eliminate other factors such as the production of safer cars , the recession and changes in other traffic laws			0
road safety : a study by the @entity9 claims that a ban on using cellphones in cars has not led to a drop in the number of accidents ( file picture ) the results appears to contradict previous research which suggests using a phone at the wheel is as dangerous as drink - driving			1
thirteen states currently ban handheld - cellphone use for all drivers , and 10 other states have some form of ban either just for younger drivers , a ban in school zones or as a local option			2
the findings published in the journal , @entity49 , said : ' we find no evidence of a state - wide decrease in accidents as a result of the ban			0
while our results are specific to @entity12 , cell phone bans in other jurisdictions that have similar enforcement and penalty parameters could be expected to have similar effects			1
' @entity9 associate economics professor @entity62 , one of the study 's authors , said : ' if it ’s really that dangerous , and if even just a fraction of people stop using their phones , we would expect to find some decrease in accidents			2
but we did n’t find any statistical evidence of a reduction			0
' ' disentangling these effects will be useful for policymakers in other states who are considering policies to address distracted driving , ' @entity62 added			0
' however , our results suggest that simply banning hand - held cellphone use may not produce the desired increase in traffic safety			1
' however , @entity62 said it is not conclusive proof the laws do not work , pointing out that some people may have already switched to handsfree devices such as @entity87 before the ban			0
crashes related to distractions caused by cellphones are said to be one of the most common causes of deaths among young people			0
the study appears to contradict previous research which suggests using a phone while driving is as dangerous as drink - driving ( file picture )			1

research *conducted* before and after @entity12 forbid cellphone use in cars
*analysis* of a million collisions found *legislation* had little impact
results contradict studies suggesting it 's as dangerous as drink - driving
