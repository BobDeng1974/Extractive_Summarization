by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 18:54 est , 10 april 2013 a miracle hamster shocked her owners when she rose from the dead during @entity5			1
@entity6 and boyfriend @entity7 from @entity8 , @entity9 , were looking after the tiny pet - then called @entity11 - for friends when they found her lying lifeless in her cage			1
they thought she was dead and wrapped her body in kitchen roll , dug a grave in their flower bed and gently laid the rodent to rest			1
the tearful pair then phoned @entity25 ’s owners @entity23 and @entity26 to break the terrible news			0
she had eaten her way out of her paper shroud , dug her way out of her grave , edged along a narrow wall and then climbed a waste pipe to land in a recycling box			1
she then crawled into an empty cat food cardboard box which became her shelter through the sub-zero night			0
@entity6 ( pictured right ) and her father @entity57 ( left ) could n't believe their eyes when @entity25 came back from the dead 24 hours later after escaping from a paper shroud @entity25 was found by ms @entity6 's startled father @entity57 the following afternoon as he went to flatten the boxes for recycling and her head suddenly popped out			1
as well as surviving her burial , the freezing night and being accidentally crushed , the robust rodent also escaped becoming a snack for the family ’s pet cat @entity70			1
ms @entity6 , 23 , a care home worker , said : “ @entity7 came home from work and found her lying in the middle of her cage cold and lifeless and he thought she was dead			1
' we wrapped her up in a load of kitchen towel and buried her about a foot deep in the back garden so that the cat could n’t dig her back up again			1
' we were looking after her for @entity23 and @entity26 while they moved house			0
' @entity7 then rang @entity26 to tell him ‘ sorry mate , but your hamster ’s passed away ’ , which was n’t a very nice thing to have to do			2
' the next day he rang him back to say ‘ mate - your hamster ’s back alive ’ and @entity26 thought he was trying to be funny			2
” local vet @entity93 said that he believes that @entity25 appeared dead because she was in hibernation			2
he said : ' it has been known for owners to believe their pets have died when in fact they are only sleeping			0
' buried alive : ' @entity11 ' managed to escape from the makeshift coffin created by by the couple before braving a night of sub zero temperature to turn up alive and well hours later @entity102 is overjoyed that ' @entity25 ' made a speedy recovery following the mix - up @entity57 , 60 , said : ' it ’s amazing that she survived			1
' she ’d been out in that freezing cold all night - it was a good 24 hours			0
' the energy she had to dig herself out of that hole , then get along the wall and climb up into that recycling box was remarkable really			0
' i was taking the boxes to the shed to squash them all down for recycling when suddenly a little face popped out of one of them which gave me a big startle i can assure you			0
' i brought the box into the house and said to @entity126 , ‘ have you lost one of your pets ? ’ ' that was when we discovered that it was @entity25 and she most definitely was n’t dead			2
' we ’ve nicknamed her @entity44 because it was @entity5 when she came back from the dead			2
” happy at home : ' @entity25 ' is relaxing after coming back from the dead			2
experts believe that the hamster was hibernating ms @entity6 - who is still caring for @entity25 - added : “ she was in the cat biscuit box that we ’d thrown out the night before			1
' she ’d managed to crawl into the little hole and survive the night in there			0
' mr @entity7 , 24 , a binman , said : “ i came home and thought she was dead because she ’s two - and - a - half years old , which is quite old for a hamster			1
“ when @entity57 found her safe and well in the recycling , i had the embarrassing job of ringing @entity26 to tell him ‘ she ’s not dead , she crawled out of her grave last night			0
’ ” experts said that @entity25 had gone into hibernation which had made her appear dead			1
vet @entity93 said : “ this is n’t the first instance of a hamster coming back from the dead that i ’ve come across			1
' if its body temperature drops below a certain level the animal can go into hibernation			0
' it has been known for owners to mistakenly believe that their pets have died when in fact they are only sleeping			0
' however , i ’m amazed by this hamster			0
the animal ’s body temperature would have had to have risen to rouse it from hibernation			0
' with the temperatures we experienced over @entity5 , one would think that the ground would have been far too cold for it to come out of its dormant state			0

pet *originally* called ' @entity11 ' buried in kitchen roll in garden
hamster ate through shroud and dug through earth to escape on @entity183
experts believe ' dead ' animal had actually been hibernating
