by @entity0 prince @entity2 's friend , @entity1 , appears at @entity3 where he is on trial accused of driving a motor vehicle when his alcohol level was above the limit a close friend of prince @entity2 refused to puff into a police breathalyser after he ' panicked ' knowing he was close to the drink drive limit , a court heard today			1
nightclub owner @entity1 was pulled over while driving his £ 90,000 @entity14 @entity13 through @entity16 ’s @entity15 , in the early hours of may 28 last year , after visiting an exclusive club he owns			1
at first the 32 - year - old refused to give a sample at the roadside before being arrested and taken to @entity21 to be tested on a more complex machine			1
at his trial , his defence team claimed radio waves from his @entity26 may then have interfered with the station 's intoxicometer - and that the machine may have even been faulty			1
in the dock , @entity1 , who recently married @entity31 heiress @entity30 at a ceremony attended by @entity2 and @entity33 , claimed he had drunk two ' large ' glasses of red wine with dinner hours before he was stopped and arrested			1
he insisted to police at the time that he had drunk two beers although today said that he was unsure of what he told them at the time			2
wearing a navy suit , white shirt and navy tie , the aristocrat , whose mother @entity46 was a close of princess @entity48 , said : ' i planned to go to a nightclub i own to check on it and see that stuff was ok			2
' i had two large glasses of red wine , i do n’t remember what [ kind ] it was			0
' mr @entity1 said he opened a bottle to himself on the evening of may 27			2
he then stopped drinking at around 11pm , with wine left in the bottle , but he could not remember how much , the court heard			0
he continued : ' i then got in my car and drove to the bar i own			0
i was there talking to staff , checking the customers are ok , i was in the back office , probably were my staff are , spoke to the staff there , that kind of stuff			0
the 32 - year - old refused to give a sample at the roadside before being arrested and taken to @entity21 , the court heard he denied that he had had any more to drink at the nightclub before climbing back in to his car shortly before 1am			1
he was pulled over just before 1.10am by police who claimed he had ' accelerated quickly ' in his luxury car			2
@entity1 said : ' i noticed the police when they put their lights on and their sirens , and then they obviously wanted me to pull over so i pulled over to the side of the road			1
' well connected : @entity1 , 32 , with princess @entity90 when asked why he refused to give a sample he said : ' i knew that i had drunk alcohol that night , that i had drunk near to what the limit was , so i was anxious			1
' in a way i panicked a little bit			0
' @entity1 was arrested and taken to @entity97 after refusing to give a sample			2
an expert witness for the defence told @entity3 that the @entity101 made intoximeter was behaving irregularly while @entity1 was tested			1
professor @entity103 , an expert witness for the defence , called into question the reliability of the breathalyser used at @entity21 to record @entity1 's alcohol levels			1
he claimed that there was an ' anomalous ' pause of 125 seconds between the machine recording a baseline reading of zero and the device 's switch being activated and ready to use			0
prof @entity103 added that the breathalyser used by officers may have also had an out of date fuel cell , rendering it defective			0
prince @entity2 , pictured with his hand on his head , pictured next to his close friend @entity1 at a @entity123 rugby match quizzed on the machine 's readings of @entity1 's breath at 52 microgrammes in 100 millilitres , prof @entity103 said : ' if something happens with no satisfactory explanation , such as the 125 second delay , i ca n't use the machine , i ca n't rely on the output '			1
but prosecutor @entity134 said : ' there is no evidence that something may take 125 seconds , it does not mean the machine was defective '			0
prof @entity103 replied : ' i do n't trust a machine that is anomalous			0
i ca n't say it was defective but if i used that argument i 'm potentially giving my colleagues a defective answer '			0
later , a software expert told the court that signals from the radios worn by officers in the custody area may have interfered with @entity1 's breathalyser reading			1
dr @entity150 said radio waves from @entity1 's @entity26 may have also affected the machine			1
' radio waves could mean the message between the machine and the reading is corrupted ' , dr @entity150 added			0
' i would query the reading			0
i ca n't conclude at all and say it 's reliable or unreliable			0
' the fact is the reading should not have been done where police radios were , it should have been redone '			0
@entity1 , left , recently married @entity31 heiress @entity30 , right , at a ceremony attended by @entity2 and @entity33 but dr @entity150 admitted that he is untrained with the intoximeter device used to record @entity1 's breath and there was ' no evidence the machine was interfered with '			1
mr @entity134 said @entity1 's evidence that he only drunk two glasses of wine was ' not credible '			1
' he says he drunk two large glasses of house red wine - which is an interesting turn of phrase when one is drinking at home			2
' he told officers he drank two pints of beer as he said in his police statement which he signed			2
' if mr @entity1 is correct then for an hour and a half or so before he was arrested he was in his car			2
' he then went to his bar			0
@entity183 say it is not credible he did not have a drink there '			0
@entity1 , who ran celebrity hotspots @entity187 and @entity188 in the past , also organised prince @entity2 ’s stag party in @entity190 three years ago			1
his grandmother , @entity191 , was a member of the @entity193 sugar dynasty and his friendship with @entity33 stems from their participation in the @entity197			0
district judge @entity198 will give his judgement on the case on a date to be fixed			0
