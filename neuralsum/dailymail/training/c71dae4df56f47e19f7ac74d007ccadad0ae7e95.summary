his plans : @entity6 used to tell the women he was a police office or some other high - powered job in order to make them fear him and the possibility of deportation ' it has been 22 long months since the incident happened to me ... i now suspect every male customer ... any small sudden motion by them will trigger me to think they are getting up to attack me			1
