as many as 100,000 foreign students a year are thought to be staying on in @entity1 illegally after completing academic courses here			1
the students – believed to be mostly from the @entity5 sub-continent – come to @entity1 to attend universities and colleges , according to official immigration figures			1
but the government ’s tracking system has failed to find evidence that they ever left the country			1
missing : some 177,000 people moved to @entity1 for long - term study last year , down from 246,000 in 2011			2
but there is now growing evidence that many of the students who came into the country in recent years never left the missing thousands have been detected at a time when numbers of student visas and student entrants to the country from outside @entity27 have been scaled down steeply as part of the @entity30 ’s drive to reduce immigration to 1990s levels			1
some 177,000 people moved to @entity1 for long - term study last year , down from 246,000 in 2011			2
but there is now growing evidence that many of the students who came into the country in recent years never left			1
the @entity38 think - tank called on ministers to set up an inquiry into what has happened to the missing students and to trace those still living in the country as illegal immigrants			2
@entity47 records show that last year 50,000 people from outside the @entity49 who came to @entity1 to study returned home , but the numbers leaving fall far short of those arriving as students			1
according to the @entity47 breakdown 145,000 non-eu students came to @entity1 in 2012 ; 185,000 in 2011 ; 186,000 in 2010 ; and 167,000 in 2009			1
most came from @entity5 and other south @entity56 countries			0
numbers of students from @entity59 are thought to have grown to be the largest national contingent last year			0
focus : the arrival and departure of students from outside the @entity49 is now under the control of home secretary @entity66 ( pictured ) the student gap has opened up at a time when the focus of immigration concerns has switched largely to migrants from @entity27 , and the probability of a new wave of immigration from @entity77 and @entity78 – whose citizens won the right to work freely in @entity1 at the start of the year			2
some of the growing attention to immigration and its effects is now likely to switch to arrivals from outside the @entity49 and the numbers of students , whose arrival and departure is under the control of home secretary @entity66			0
sir @entity88 of @entity38 said : ‘ it is very significant that the number of @entity92 students recorded as departing last year was only 50,000 , compared to an average inflow over the last five years of 155,000			0
‘ this suggests that students staying on legally or otherwise comprise a major part of net migration			0
this issue of the missing students is one that absolutely must now be tackled			0
‘ the education industry is in denial			0
whatever the benefits of genuine students , which we all accept , it is absolutely absurd to accept near to 200,000 a year with no effective checks on their departure			0
’ in @entity109 is to investigate claims that private universities are giving taxpayer - funded loans to thousands of students who do n’t go to class			2
students have allegedly been claiming money without proper proof of @entity1 residence following government reforms which allow private college students to claim maintenance loans and grants of up to £ 11,000 a year			1
colleges can receive £ 6,000 in tuition fees for each student enrolled .			0

government tracking system can not find evidence students ever left @entity1
tens of thousands may now be living here illegally after completing studies
majority of students under *suspicion* are from the @entity5 sub-continent
records show they *originally* came to @entity1 to attend universities and colleges
