per @entity0 accepts @entity1 are still misfiring despite pulling off a dramatic late 2 - 1 win over @entity3 in @entity4 to stay on course for the @entity7 knock - out stages			1
the @entity8 got away with a largely average display at the @entity10 , where a second - half header from @entity12 looked to have put the @entity13 on course for a famous win to ruin manager @entity17 's 65th birthday			1
however , just as they did in rescuing a point at home to @entity20 with a stoppage - time equaliser in the @entity22 on saturday , @entity1 struck late			1
first , left - back @entity23 volleyed in a superb finish in the 89th minute and then substitute @entity26 crashed in a dramatic winner			0
per @entity0 admitted he has struggled for motivation since winning the @entity29 with @entity30 @entity1 now have qualification for the knock - out stages back in their own hands ahead of next month 's return tie against @entity3 at the @entity35 , and then hosting @entity38 leaders @entity36			1
@entity0 , though , knows the @entity8 can not afford the continued inconsistencies which have seen early - season promise quickly turn back to familiar questions about the direction of @entity17 's squad following only five wins from the opening 14 matches			1
' everyone knows that it was a difficult start for us and our confidence is not that much how we wanted it , ' the @entity48 defender said			2
@entity1 players celebrate with @entity26 after his decisive goal at @entity10 ' the character is good , the mentality is good , but football-wise , we lack a few things			2
' our passing game is not as efficient as last year			0
we are not at our best			0
we have to admit that , be honest with ourselves and train harder			0
' by his own admission , @entity0 has not produced the consistent form of last season , with the 6ft 7in @entity48 culpable for failing to deal with a cross which lead to @entity20 taking the lead on saturday			1
the 30 - year - old retired from international football after @entity30 's summer @entity29 triumph but accepts the highs in @entity71 came at some cost to his subsequent club performances			1
summer signing @entity74 has been one of the few impressive @entity1 players this season ' personally it is difficult at the moment because that was really a long season last year and to come back from that @entity29 and get the motivation back ... i am nearly back , but you can feel there is something missing at the moment , ' he said			1
' with those games , the belief and the mentality is there , but the motivation will come back			0
' we did n't even have time to celebrate [ the @entity29 win ] properly , that was the first thing , but you realise month after month what happened			2
' i am still not there [ taking in ] what happened in @entity71 , maybe in five or 10 years you can really realise what was going on there			0
@entity17 's side are seventh in the @entity22 and second in their @entity7 group ' we came back to @entity105 , got on the stage , waved our hands , showed the @entity29 and then everyone disappeared to their families to get some holidays , some rest and calm			1
' mertesacker said it was a struggle to relax into ' a proper holiday ' and said the resumption of club football was on his mind			0
' that was really a problem , but i am happy not to have picked up an injury yet and i am confident that i have already been through the dangerous period , ' he added			0
@entity124 passes the ball under pressure from @entity3 's @entity127 and @entity128 ' i am really happy that i am slowly fit and ready for the proper fight during the winter period			2
' @entity17 allowed his @entity29 winners to miss the opening games of the season to fit in a suitable break			1
' it is harder mentally because we started literally when the season ( had already ) started			0
i have never experienced that , ' @entity0 said			0
' but slowly , now it is 100 days or so after the @entity29 final , so the season is going to start ( for real )			2

@entity1 beat @entity3 2 - 1 in their @entity7 clash
but the @entity8 ' performance was again *disappointing*
per @entity0 said @entity1 need to improve
the @entity48 also admitted he has struggled for motivation this season
mertesacker said it was hard to *adjust* after winning the @entity29
