druids , vegans and green activists should be given special treatment at work , according to ‘ lunatic ’ advice from the equalities watchdog			1
the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) warns employers that they risk ‘ potentially costly legal action ’ unless they allow staff to follow their ‘ religion or belief rights ’ in the workplace			1
this could include giving believers time off to go on pilgrimages , such as druids and pagans going to @entity19 , while environmentalists should be free to lecture other staff about their car use			2
rights : the @entity7 has warned employers that they should allow staff to follow their ' religion or belief rights ' in the workplace , which could include giving pagans time off work to visit @entity19 in @entity30 druids should have the same rights at work as mainstream religious staff , according to the new guidelines vegetarian kitchen workers could refuse to do tasks that offend their beliefs , such handling meat			1
critics say that by the same logic vegans could refuse to work in an office furnished with leather chairs			2
even atheists should have their beliefs respected , according to the new guidance			1
it has been issued in the wake of the landmark @entity49 ruling that @entity50 may wear a cross at work			1
vegetarians could also refuse to clean out fridges if they contain meat under the guidance but rather than focusing on @entity50 rights in the workplace – which it insists are still strictly limited – the controversial quango suggests employers should give equal respect to fringe and non-religious groups			2
the guidance is likely to be seen as an insult by some @entity50 and other religious observers as it appears to put lifestyle choices like vegetarianism on a par with their deeply - held spiritual beliefs			1
officials insisted they were trying to be helpful by alerting businesses topotential legal pitfalls			0
but @entity74 @entity73 said the watchdog had gone ‘ many steps too far ’ and warned that the guidance would have a damaging effect on employers , particularly small businesses			0
@entity80 , a member of the commons business , innovation and skills committee , said the economy could not afford such ‘ frivolous nonsense ’			0
he added : ‘ we need to recognise the importance of people being able to earn a living			0
we need small businesses to be able to thrive , not to be weighed down with this sort of nonsense			0
’ fellow @entity74 @entity89 called for the quango to be scrapped			0
he said : ‘ if anyone ever doubted that the @entity7 is packed full of idiots who have no idea about the real world or running a business then this is all the evidence they need			1
’ @entity97 warned that the guidance could lead to a flood of vexatious legal claims			0
mr @entity97 , a @entity74 mp and former international lawyer , said : ‘ this is a recipe for every crank and crazy to take their boss for a ride			0
the @entity7 has become an expensive taxpayer - funded laughing stock			1
’ the guidance follows the successful bid by @entity111 worker @entity109 to overturn a ban on wearing a small crucifix at work			0
but the 12 - page @entity7 document makes it clear that the rights of @entity50 in the workplace are strictly limited			2
it gives the example of a religious magistrate asking to be excused from dealing with cases involving the upbringing of children by gay couples			0
the new advice comes after @entity111 employee @entity109 won her case at the @entity49 in january when it ruled that she had suffered discrimination at work because of her faith the guidance suggests it would be reasonable to refuse the request because the rights of gay couples are more important			1
but in other areas it suggests the @entity139 court ruling could have a wide - ranging impact on the right of employees to express their religion and beliefs at work			2
it says employers can refuse to consider a request if they suspect a belief is not sincerely held , but warns : ‘ an employer should only question a belief in the most exceptional cases ’			0
last night an @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity7 does not make the law on what is or is n’t a legitimate religion or belief			2
this is set by @entity158			0
it is important to remember that employers are not required to accept these types of request			0
‘ the @entity7 ’s role is to provide free , expert advice to employers helping them understand and deal with what can be complex issues , and helping them avoid potentially costly legal action			1
’ the advice was welcomed by the @entity170 , which said it gave official recognition that ‘ vegetarianism can be , and indeed often is , a deeply held belief ’			1
the @entity7 said although the recent cases at the @entity49 , pictured , were about @entity50 they had further ' implications ' for employers			1

the @entity7 has released new advice
says deeply held beliefs by vegetarians , vegans , atheists , *ecologists* and druids should be taken seriously by bosses
comes after series of *judgements* by the @entity49
