' sometimes people do n't ' ever hit their partners again , @entity0 said , ' but it 's rare			1
' a family affair : recently renamed the @entity0 , @entity44 and @entity45 , the former president now runs his global non-profit with the help of his wife and daughter ' no incident should be ignored , ' @entity0 said , ' because if you do that , it just gets progressively worse			1
' based on my experience , i think it 's a mistake to ignore it , ' he said			0
@entity0 would n't say whether her thought there should be a zero tolerance policy for domestic violence in the @entity1 , but he did say ' there should be consequences for domestic abuse and every case they know about			1
' ' what the consequences should be should be determined by the facts , ' he said , ' and of course how serious it was			0
' @entity0 , who signed the @entity72 into law 20 years ago this month , has been open about his stepfather 's abuse of his mother throughout his younger years			1

' the incident with @entity6 and his then - fiancee and now wife , is just one of many instances of spousal abuse taking place in @entity111 , he said			1
' and look , i 'm not minimizing what happened on the elevator , i 'm just telling you that anybody who 's ever been in one of these situations has seen it over and over and over again , ' @entity0 added			2
' so i think we need to try to figure out how to make something good happen out all of this , ' @entity0 said			0
the former @entity123 governor said society needs to realize that ' in real life there are people , good people , who lose their self control ' and hit their spouses			0
victims of abuse know that they should probably leave their partners ' because they ca n't help it , they 're gon na do it over and over again , ' @entity0 said			2

furthermore , @entity0 said that society should n't write off every football player in the @entity1 as a criminal because of the abusive behavior of their current and former teammates			1
many of them are ' good husbands and good fathers , ' he said			0

@entity0 also claimed in the interview that the concussions that football players receive on the field may lead to more domestic disputes			2
researchers have warned in the wake of the @entity6 affair that no conclusive evidence exists to support that theory , however .			0
