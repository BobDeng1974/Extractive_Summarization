when @entity1 was a teenager , she enjoyed singing along to the lyrics of one of her favourite tunes - rooftops by @entity6			1
she loved the song so much , she decided to have a tattoo on her belly in 2012 featuring the lyrics ' scream your heart out '			1
but the aspiring model from @entity14 , @entity15 , lived to regret her decision after the band 's lead singer was later exposed as a serial paedophile and child abuser			1
@entity1 said she was shocked when she heard about @entity39 's depraved crimes - and hated the fact she was associated with him thanks to her tattoo			1
' when i found out about @entity31 i was disgusted , ' she said on the new series of @entity46 show tattoo disasters			2
' it 's wrong and he completely abused his power			2
i was ashamed i had something of his on my body and it 's stuck there			2
' in an interview with @entity56 , @entity1 , now 22 , said she was never a huge fan of the band but she had the tattoo because the lyrics resonated with her when she was younger			1
@entity60 @entity31 was sent to prison for 35 years for a string of child sex offences ' scream your heart out did n't have any personal meaning but it was a line that stuck in my head and i liked singing it aloud , ' she said			1
' i wanted to have a tattoo across the bottom of my stomach and i thought lyrics would look good there so i chose that line because i liked the song			2
' the tattoo - which cost Â£ 60 - was not @entity1 's first			1
she already had eight and now has more than 20 ( she 's lost count of the exact number ) on her arms , legs and body			0
but she no longer wanted to have the @entity24 's lyrics following @entity39 's imprisonment and struggled to cover it up when she wore crop tops and vests when regularly working out at the gym			0
' everyone kept asking me what i was going to do about it , ' she said			0
she admitted that laser removal surgery was ' not an option ' as she had heard it was extremely painful and expensive			0
so instead , she contacted a number of tattoo artists to see if they could cover the lyrics by working them into a new tattoo design			0
but none of the artists she spoke to could think of a way to do it			0
they told her the tattoo was too bold to be obscured			0
however , @entity1 was then put in contact with tattooist to the stars @entity107 who is based in @entity109			2
he has inked the bodies of many famous people including @entity113 and @entity114			0
@entity1 with tattooist to the stars @entity107 who had an idea of a design to cover the lyrics before : @entity1 had been told she would never be rid of the line because the tattoo was too big and bold after : @entity107 was able to hide the lyrics with this owl design that @entity1 loves after meeting @entity1 , he came up with the idea to paint a giant owl on her stomach			1
after agreeing to the design , @entity1 spent a total of ten and a half hours at @entity107 's studio having the tattoo drawn and coloured in			1
she said getting the tattoo was ' horrifically painful ' but she has no regrets			0
she said : ' i really like the new design			0
it 's pretty and you ca n't see the lyrics at all now , you would never know they had been there			0
' the experience has n't put @entity1 off having more tattoos in the future - in fact she 's already planning to have a giant picture of @entity144 painted across her whole back			1
but she added she would think twice about having lyrics tattooed on her body again - unless they had a personal significance .			2

@entity1 loved singing along to @entity6 song as a teen
