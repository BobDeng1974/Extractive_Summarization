by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:01 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 07:47 est , 20 june 2013 for more than 40 years it has gently chugged along giving joy rides to generations of delighted children			1
but last week the model railway at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , was brought to an abrupt standstill at the insistence of health and safety bosses			1
excited youngsters who had flocked for the park 's annual @entity15 were ordered off the miniature train moments before it was about to depart because council bureaucrats say the genteel attraction does not have the necessary certification			1
all change : the miniature railway has been popular with young children and families for generations but now requires a health and safety certificate despite @entity29 having safely operated the railway without incident since the 1970s , @entity28 now says the tracks must be subject to an ' independent inspection '			1
society member @entity34 accused the council of being heavy - handed and said the safety certificate they had been asked to produce was the kind expected of ' high - speed , money - making fairground rides '			2
he said : ' we have been running the railway for over 40 years without incident but now the council needs to see a certificate stating that it is safe			1
' it would appear that council officials are requiring the same level of certification as that required for high - speed , money - making fairground rides			0
' he added : ' we would like to apologise to kids , of all ages , who hoped to have a ride on the miniature railway as part of their gala day outing			1
' we especially want to apologise to the passengers who were ordered off the train just before its departure			0
' heavy - handed : society member @entity34 accused the council of asking for the kind of certification required by high - speed fairground rides local councillor @entity70 pointed out that the @entity29 is covered by public liability insurance and maintains the railway equipment to meet with @entity73 ( @entity73 ) guidelines			2
he said : ' while i appreciate the need to ensure public safety , i have to ask why this was not sorted out long before the gala day			2
' i hope everyone concerned can put their heads together and get the @entity83 train back on the rails as soon as possible			0
' it would be a terrible loss to generations of @entity8 people if they were to lose the train			1
' local authority chiefs defended the decision to put the brakes on the gala day railway fun			0
a spokesman said : ' an accident at @entity7 could have very serious consequences , particularly if a lot of children were riding on a train at the time			2
' there are raised sections of track which need proper maintenance to make sure they can take the weight of the train and passengers			0
' on may 21 , we asked the model railway society to have a safety check carried out by a suitable independent inspector			1
' the council gave the society plenty of notice but we made it clear they would not be allowed to run rides for the public on @entity119 if it did nâ€™t have a safety certificate			1
' we offered to meet members of the society on the day of the gala but no one turned up , so we had no option but to prevent the train rides from taking place			0
' some members of the public were asked to get off the train and they were happy to do so when the situation was explained to them			0
' the council will now arrange to have the inspection done			0
' in 2011 , the new boss of the @entity73 @entity136 said she wanted to put an an end to misguided ' jobsworths ' who wrongly use legislation to ban sensible activities			0
ms @entity136 said health and safety had become ' shorthand for someone , somewhere , stopping someone from doing something they want to '			2
here are ten more examples of council ' elf and safety decisions gone mad :			0
