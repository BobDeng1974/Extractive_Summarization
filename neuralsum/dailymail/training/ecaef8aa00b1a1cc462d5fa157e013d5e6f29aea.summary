fathers and grandparents will not be given any legal right to see children after a break - up , under the biggest changes to family law in a generation			1
in what was immediately denounced as a ‘ betrayal ’ of the family , a major report today rules against giving men shared or equal time with their children when a relationship ends			1
it suggests fathers will even be denied the legal right to maintain a ‘ meaningful relationship ’ with their families , as this ‘ would do more harm than good ’			1
frozen out : both fathers and grandparents could lose the right to see children under a huge shake - up to family law the review also kicks into touch @entity30 pledges to make it easier to maintain contact with grandchildren when parents separate , a problem that usually affects those on the father ’s side			1
the long - awaited @entity39 was branded a ‘ monstrous sham ’ that undermines @entity43 ’s pledge to lead the most family - friendly government in history			1
the independent report was commissioned by ministers to examine the case for reform of a family law system repeatedly accused of putting rights of mothers over those of fathers and grandparents			1
but its proposals – likely to form the basis of future government family policy – sparked an immediate @entity60 revolt			2
pledge : @entity43 , pictured yesterday , promised to lead the most family - friendly government in history			1
work and pensions secretary @entity64 , right , will do more for fathers and grandparents , his allies said break - up : fathers will lose the right to have a meaningful relationship with their children when they split from their partner , the long - awaited @entity39 appeared to suggest allies of work and pensions secretary @entity64 said he would fight to ensure the government ’s response – due to be published in january – will do more for fathers and grandparents			1
a source close to the cabinet minister said that the findings were ‘ absurd ’ , warning that they undermined attempts to tackle the generation of fatherless youths blamed for the summer ’s riots			2
but justice secretary @entity83 is expected to back the review , chaired by former civil servant and @entity86 executive @entity39			2
his report was commissioned by @entity88 and dismissed by the @entity89 in @entity90 as inadequate but will now form the basis of @entity30 legislation			1
the review comes against a backdrop of soaring divorce rates and increasing numbers of children being born out of wedlock , often to co-habitees who are more likely to break up than married couples			2
last year there were almost three million children aged under 16 living in a lone - parent household – or 24 per cent of the total			2
mr @entity39 ’s findings fly in the face of studies showing that it is best for a child to have extensive access to both its father and mother			2
the report says : ‘ no legislation should be introduced that creates or risks creating the perception that there is a parental right to substantially shared or equal time for both parents			1
’ mr @entity39 has even watered down his own interim report , published in march , which said there should be a legal presumption that children should have a ‘ meaningful relationship ’ with both parents			1
@entity128 is a millionaire economist with three children of his own			0
@entity39 , 63 , pictured , earned a reputation as a tough taskmaster during 16 years in a string of senior roles at @entity86			0
he quit in 2004 following a disastrous set of @entity138 results for the retailer , taking with him a £ 754,000 pay - off and a £ 100,000 - a - year pension			0
as trustee of the firm ’s pension fund he then famously saw off a hostile £ 9.1billion takeover bid from sir @entity146			0
mr @entity39 , who lives in @entity147 , @entity148 , took an unlikely career break , flying to @entity150 for a six - week stint as a farmhand			0
but the former @entity154 economist – who served as @entity156 ’s private secretary in @entity157 – soon returned to work , becoming the first chairman of the @entity159 in 2005			0
he remains chairman of the @entity161			0
mr @entity39 believes that enshrining such rights in law could slow down already lengthy and expensive custody cases			0
instead , the courts will simply have to consider the benefits of a meaningful relationship when they decide where children should live and how often they should see each parent			1
the final report flatly rejected claims by fathers ’ rights groups that the current system is biased – despite figures showing that 93 per cent of custody battles are won by the mother			1
@entity179 , of the @entity180 campaign group , said : ‘ the review is a monstrous sham and a bureaucratic exercise in improving the efficiency of injustice			0
it will feed the epidemic of mass fatherlessness and lead to further social unrest			0
‘ this report condemns children to a life without fathers with catastrophic social consequences			1
’ the report also contradicts pledges by senior officials earlier this year that grandparents would be given far greater rights			1
instead , they will still have to apply to court twice to see their grandchildren : once for the right to begin a case and then to seek access to their loved ones			0
the @entity208 panel merely issued a tepid recommendation that their role should be ‘ emphasised ’			0
instead of legal protections for fathers and grandparents , the @entity208 report laid out plans to encourage parents to settle disputes before they get to court			1
all parents will be given advice on drawing up ‘ parenting agreements ’ to divide the care of their children			0
@entity225 , of grandparents apart @entity227 , said : ‘ the @entity89 said before the election that grandparents were going to have more rights			0
this is a betrayal of that promise			0
it was all a con and a gimmick			0
‘ this report is trying to do away with the traditional family			1
the result will be more bitter and disillusioned young boys who join gangs			0
’ a source close to mr @entity43 said the government has ‘ certainly not ’ pledged to adopt all the report ’s recommendations			2
but a source close to mr @entity83 described it as ‘ an authoritative account of the problems and a thoughtful look at the solutions ’			0
the report also said no childcare case should last more than six months and recommended the creation of a @entity252 to focus the work of all agencies for the 500,000 children and adults caught up in the family courts each year .			2

fathers will be denied the right to have a ' meaningful relationship ' with their families , report suggests
@entity64 will fight to do more for men , his aides pledge
