@entity0 had not scored a goal since december and @entity2 had not won a league game since may — but the @entity5 striker put both things right on saturday with a clinical double in a fine all - round display			1
the 27 - year - old forward was also the creator of his team ’s opener , scored by @entity12			1
only a few weeks ago @entity0 ’s manager @entity13 dropped the forward from his squad entirely in the hope that it might motivate him			2

@entity2 ’s five points from five draws in six games before saturday were starting to look like the returns of team that had forgotten how to get across the line			1
this victory had the instant effect of putting the spring back in @entity13 ’s step			0
‘ now we can say we ’ve lost one in seven , ’ he beamed			0
‘ it ’s a great feeling , ’ @entity13 said			0
‘ i ’m very pleased for the players			0
it was very important for them to win			2
' i ’m very pleased for @entity0 because i know how hard it was for him to be left out of the squad			2
he did n’t like it but he worked hard			0
’ @entity18 arrived in search of a first @entity21 win at @entity2 , but a consolation goal by @entity100 to make it 1 - 1 was their only reward			1
manager @entity72 said : ‘ that was n’t great from us			0
' we did n’t defend correctly or with any sense of purpose			0
we did n’t create enough , either			0
‘ we want to be viewed as a consistent team at this level and we can do a lot better than that			0
’ this match did not promise the goals it delivered , both sides having scored a paltry five this season in six games			2
but in starting with an adventurous , three - man attack — @entity0 flanked by @entity12 to his left and @entity41 to his right , @entity13 showed intent			1
@entity2 were ahead inside five minutes , @entity0 collecting a throw - in down the right - hand side			1
he ran to the byline and fired across goal to @entity12 , who steered home with his head while leaning backwards			2
@entity18 ’s equaliser began with @entity2 losing possession in their own half , allowing @entity128 to run and lay off to @entity60 just outside the home area			1
@entity12 gave @entity2 an early lead in the 4th minute of their @entity21 match at home to @entity18 on saturday @entity12 ( centre ) rose above former @entity2 team - mate @entity52 ( right ) to head past @entity51 ( left ) in the @entity18 goal @entity12 ( centre ) celebrates his goal with @entity0 ( left ) and @entity36 ( right ) at the @entity136 @entity2 's lead lasted 11 minutes though as @entity18 equalised through midfielder @entity100 's strike @entity60 ( centre right ) drilled home a left - footed shot into the bottom right corner of @entity31 's net to make the scoreline 1 - 1 @entity2 striker @entity0 restored their lead in the first half to give his side a 2 - 1 victory against @entity18 @entity0 ( second left ) met team - mate 's @entity39 corner to head home past @entity151 goalkeeper @entity51 @entity51 ( centre ) can only look on despairingly as @entity0 's header bounces into the bottom corner of his goal at the @entity136 click here to see our brilliant match zone including the heat map of @entity2 's @entity0 mins @entity159 @entity2 total 113.9 70.8 @entity38 90 11.1 6.9 @entity12 90 10.6 6.6 @entity0 90 10.4 6.5 @entity18 total 109.6 68.1 @entity100 90 11.5 7.1 @entity160 90 11.2 7.0 @entity70 90 10.7 6.7 data courtesy of the @entity162 , the @entity163 of the @entity21 @entity60 slalomed forward , dropping his shoulder as he rumbled past @entity33 and @entity34 before slotting home smartly with a left - foot finish			1

@entity2 were ahead again eight minutes later , @entity39 crossing to @entity0 , whose downward header bulleted into the bottom , right - hand corner			1
it was @entity0 ’s first goal in 17 games			2
the second half became niggly and disjointed with six bookings and all six substitutes on the field by the 78th minute			0
but it was two players who had been on from the start — @entity12 and @entity0 — who combined to put @entity2 3 - 1 up , the former riding several challenges into the box before laying off to @entity37			1
he miscued , allowing the ball to fall to @entity0 , who smashed it into the roof of the net			2
@entity18 striker @entity62 came close to scoring just before half - time , bringing out a smart save from @entity31 @entity61 ( centre left ) battles for the ball against three @entity2 players as he tried to find a way back into the match for @entity18 @entity52 ( right ) was one of seven players to be booked in a feisty encounter at the @entity136 on saturday afternoon			1
