but now i am looking at how much caffeine is in energy drinks , i just ca n't believe they are on sale			2
' mr @entity138 , added : ' this could have happened to anyone			0
it was n’t caused by alcohol , it was the amount of caffeine in her body			2
it 's shocking the amount of caffeine in those drinks			2
' medics said that while most people can tolerate caffeine in moderation , ' excessive consumption ' can lead to seizures , strokes or sudden death			2
consultant emergency physician at @entity110 , dr @entity175 , said : ' given the potential for harm as seen from reviews and reports of toxicity in medical literature , it suggests children and young adults , especially those with predisposing medical conditions , are potentially at risk from some serious adverse effects from excessive consumption of energy drinks			0
' one in ten @entity191 teenagers consumes four to five energy drinks a week high in sugar , cleverly marketed and sold in supermarkets and shops alongside regular soft drinks , it 's easy to see why young people in their masses have taken to energy drinks			2
last year , a major study found our children have one of the highest consumption rates in @entity206			0
one in ten @entity191 teenagers consumes four to five energy drinks a week			0
worryingly , younger children are following suit : one in four under - tens - 24 per cent - has had at least one energy drink in the past year , compared with the @entity206 average of 18 per cent			2
now , experts are calling for them to be banned from sale to youngsters			0

' although caffeine has been widely considered to be benign , awareness is increasing that its consumption is associated with substantial harm , including fatalities and near - fatalities , ' he wrote			0
' how many caffeine - related fatalities and near - misses must there be before we regulate ? ' in january month , a government adviser compared energy drinks with drugs , and urged schools to ban them			1
some schools have done so , with many teachers complaining the drinks affect behaviour and concentration			0
and a 2011 study in @entity240 reported on a number of cases where excessive caffeine consumption in energy drinks had been associated with effects such as ' seizures , mania , stroke and sudden death '			0
the researchers warned that high caffeine drinks were particularly risky for children with existing conditions such as heart arrhythmias , diabetes or mood and behavioural disorders , which may be undiagnosed .			1

@entity5 , 18 , was drinking shots on a two - for - one drinks promotion
but as alcohol wore off , the high levels of caffeine in her system took control
suffered cardiac arrest and was put in coma as medics *battled* to save her
she is now *campaigning* to warn of dangers of high caffeine drinks
