the proof that some drivers are a complete menace on the roads is all in these pictures			2
and you certainly do n't need to be eagle - eyed to spot them , with drivers taking to highways with over-sized packages hanging from open boots , carpets rolling from the back of vans and mattresses loosely strapped to car roofs			1
there 's even a motorcyclist wearing a chair over his helmet			2
these do - it - yourself delivery drivers are taping down illegal fridge loads and strapping four - burner barbecues to the back of boots while making a mockery of the road rules			1
now police are fighting back , with the @entity29 in @entity30 posting photographs on their @entity33 page of law - breakers taken by officers - or stunned members of the public - from @entity30 and around the world			1
the page has gone viral with more than 100,000 ' fans ' either send images or simply viewing the latest compilation of reckless acts			1
police have said while some of the examples are viewed as ' light - hearted fun ' , they can also lead to serious injury and sometimes death			0
this oversized boat is about to take a tumble off the side of this badly loaded truck another poorly loaded fridge thrown in to the back of this car as it travels along a major road do not overtake truck while turning : impossible - this driver blocked a whole street when he tried to turn right , left ... who knows ? i bought a fridge ! : jeep driver tapes his fridge down to the back of this car tall order : this is a ladder , on the tray of a ute without any secure strapping whatsoever roll out the brown carpet ! open double doors at the back of this van allows the load to stick out the back inspector @entity104 , of @entity105 , said a motorist was killed last year when a load fell from the back of a truck at @entity110 , south west of @entity111 , and crushed the driver travelling behind			1
he said the images are evidence that these acts are not just happening in foreign countries with lax road laws , but back home in @entity119 as well			2
' we get sent pictures from time to time and it just shows that these acts are not just happening in other countries but here as well , ' inspector @entity104 said			0
mr @entity104 said where there is enough evidence to investigate a tip - off , police will usually take steps to prosecute drivers			2
but in most cases - such as the booted - up barbecue - identifying drivers can sometimes be difficult			0
' the barbecue driver had no number plates , and there was no date , time or place on the image			0
' ' it makes it hard to track down			0
' he said most of the images that filter through are of trucks and large heavy vehicles with illegally stacked or restrained loads			1
strange bedfellows : not one , but two mattresses stacked on one another while they stick out the back of this car 's boot an improvised truck made from wooden slats , used doors and other implements to transport an unsafe load fruit packs illegally tied to the back of this ute make it impossible for this driver to see through his rear vision mirror the same driver pulled to the side of the road and questioned over the load a rear on view shows the full extent to which this driver 's rear views are obstructed they 're potentially deadly death traps for cars , pedestrians and passing motorcycles travelling behind or past the culprits			1
@entity105 will launch @entity178 - a high - visibility traffic operation â€“ to combat the long - weekend road toll			0
@entity105 deputy commissioner @entity181 said the need for vigilance was high this weekend			0
' this long weekend marks the start of the busy run up to @entity186 and the @entity187 ; families returning from school holidays ; as well as major sporting events across @entity111			0
' we expect to see a large increase of motorists taking to the roads to enjoy these events and the warmer weather , however , this always brings an element of risk			0
' back seat driving : this man doubles up as a passenger and a support mechanism for a bed loaded to the roof of a car a motorbike improperly strapped to the hub cap of this utility vehicle , possibly in the @entity209 a piece of thin rope strapped around the rear of this load while a vehical tails him just metres behind three sleepers stacked together and held on to with one hand by the driver as he navigates the road at the same time two cars transported illegally towed to the back of this truck landed the driver in hot water with police it 's unsure what exactly is hanging out of the back of this van but whatever it is - it 's not legal wide load : piping laid across the top of this ute may have created some problems for passing motorists			1

frustrated police have been posting photos of illegally loaded utes , trucks and cars
some of the images include barbecues strapped to open boots , and even an oversized boat *precariously* hanging from the side of a truck
others include drivers simply breaking the nation 's road rules
the images are on the @entity258 and @entity29 page
police make no *apologies* about the public *shaming* of the drivers
they have also *flagged* hefty fines and *warnings* to other motorists on their @entity33 page
