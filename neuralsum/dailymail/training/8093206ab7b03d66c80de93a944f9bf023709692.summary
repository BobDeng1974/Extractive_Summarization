by @entity0 the wreckage of a wooden steamship carrying 106 passengers , which sank in @entity5 in 1888 , has been found			2
more than a century after the @entity6 was nearly sliced in half by a ship twice its size , sonar has located the boat 216ft below the surface			1
the wreckage from the bay 's second - worst maritime disaster was found as oceanographers charted shipping channels before the @entity18			1
located : the wreck of the @entity6 has been found 126 years after it sank under the @entity20			1
this 2013 image provided by the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) shows a multi-beam sonar profile view of the shipwreck of the iron and wood steamship tragic : the @entity6 was carrying 90 passengers on the 1888 trip from the @entity5 bay to @entity31			1
she was split in two by a ship more than twice its size , killing 16 people and becoming the bay 's second - worst maritime disaster on the day the @entity38 sank , killing 16 people including two children and three crew members , a dense fog was filling the bay			1
the @entity38 was carrying passengers from @entity5 to @entity31 when it collided with a large immigrant ship			2
more than a century after it sank , a @entity22 team has found the resting place of the doomed ship			2
the crew used sonic imaging equipment to capture new three - dimensional images of the wreckage in may last year , and released their findings this week			2
' using a multi-beam sonar system , crews got nice three - dimensional sound pictures of the bottom that showed a wreck sitting upright , ' @entity53 , a @entity22 shipwreck researcher and archaeologist who was chief scientist for the 2010 mapping of the @entity56 , said			1
the shipwreck 's rough location was first discovered two years after it sank , but the sonar and renewed research into the collision has unearthed new details			1
discovery : teams using sonar to check routes for the @entity18 found the wreckage under the @entity20 the sonar showed the wreck 's hull rising about 18ft from the sea bed , and clearly reveals the gash in the hull which caused it to sink			1
when researchers looked into the background of the crash , they found tons of newspaper articles and transcripts of testimony from the accident investigation			1
@entity53 said newspapers at the time put much of the blame for the deaths on the crew of the immigrant steamer , the @entity22 , which survived the ordeal with a few dents in its hull			2
yet , @entity22 scientists say much of the newspaper coverage failed to include witness accounts of heroism , and that the official investigation faulted the @entity38 's skipper with the accident			1
' the papers initially reacted , talking about the tragedy and accusations that the @entity108 crew stood by and let people drown , ' @entity53 said			0
' but what happens is you start to see things also come out ... countering that			0
some leaped in water to save a drowning child			0
' ' history is made up of a lot of people who never made it into the books , ' @entity53 told @entity122			0
' same with this shipwreck			1
it was filled with everyday people who got into a situation beyond their control			0
' a thick fog was covering the bay on the morning of august 22 , when the @entity38 set off , but research showed the seas were calm			0
but there was a big incoming tide , which created a rip current off @entity135 near the mouth of the bay , which affected the @entity38 's ability to move quickly			0
the two ships spotted each other when they were about a half - mile apart but failed to reverse their engines in time			0
the @entity22 's bow went 10ft into the hull of the @entity38 , and the @entity22 's captain kept some momentum in the ship to keep the hole plugged in an effort to give people a chance to escape			0
however , five or six minutes later , the @entity38 was gone			0
' @entity153 crew was up on the bow reaching down to survivors on the @entity38 , lifting them on the deck , ' @entity150 , @entity22 's @entity151 regional maritime heritage coordinator , said			1
' after the collision , in five or six minutes , the @entity22 crew went on to save a lot of people			0
' the sinking was the second worst maritime disaster in the @entity5 , after the @entity163 struck rocks on the way into port in 1901 , exploded and sank with the loss of 130 people			2
no attempt will be made to raise the ship but a display with the @entity38 's history and new images will open at @entity5 's @entity174 , which looks over the spot where the ship went down in front of the @entity20 .			0
