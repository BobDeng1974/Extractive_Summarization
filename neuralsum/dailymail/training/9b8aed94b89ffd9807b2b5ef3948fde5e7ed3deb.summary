and you do n’t need to know computer code , advanced robotics or electrical engineering to get started			0
in fact , all that 's required is the ability to match up colours , a little imagination and $ 59 ( £ 37 )			1
the company recently launched the robot on crowd funding website @entity18 to help begin the production process and is now $ 34,110 towards its $ 100,000 goal			2
the unique modular design use magnetic balls as joints and hinges and has no external wires			1
@entity22 modular robots use magnetic balls as joints and hinges and have no external wires the kits come as individuals cubes that are designed to snap together to make a static structure			1
each cubes has a colour - coded connecting face to help signpost how it needs to be joined up to other blocks ’ various functions to work			1
a bluetooth module can also be attached so that anyone can control their customised robot using a smartphone or tablet			0
other modules allow users to include additional power , motion and sensing capabilities			0
