@entity0 is on @entity1 while @entity2 undergoes regime change and terrorists slaughter ethnic and religious minorities calling heads of state to lobby participation in humanitarian assistance program – in between golf and fundraising @entity12 columnist wrote that the president ' risks fueling the impression that he is detached as the world burns ' @entity18 foreign minister @entity17 has a message about @entity2 for @entity0 : get back to the @entity20 and do something			1
' i know it is the holiday period in our @entity25 countries , ' @entity17 told a radio interviewer tuesday in @entity18 , ' but when people are dying , you must come back from vacation			0
' full - time workers in @entity18 are guaranteed a whopping five weeks of paid vacation every year , making his plea all the more urgent			0
@entity0 is on a family and golfing holiday in a ritzy neighborhood of @entity1 but says he will come back to @entity38 this weekend before returning on tuesday to fun , sun , and more golf			1
@entity18 foreign affairs minister @entity17 ( c ) visited @entity2 refugees in @entity43 on sunday , saying upon his return to @entity18 that vacations for certain world leaders should cease while people are dying there what a putt : @entity0 risks looking aloof as @entity2 burns as town after @entity2 town is conquered by @entity54 , an @entity55 terror group that claims it has established an ' islamic state , ' @entity0 's approach has consisted so far of airlifting humanitarian supplies to victimized groups , protecting the aid drops with airstrikes , and begging for help from allies			1
@entity63 , @entity18 , @entity64 and other @entity66 nations have backed the humanitarian assistance with material and personnel , reported @entity70 , which first broke news of the @entity18 diplomat 's criticism			2
meanwhile @entity0 and vice president @entity74 have been encouraging a nascent @entity2 government from a safe distance , while assuring @entity77 that the @entity77 wo n't enter another prolonged war with boots on the ground			1
eyebrows went up wednesday in @entity38 , though , when the @entity20 announced that @entity0 was leaning toward deploying ground troops to @entity83 , a northern @entity2 hideout to which tens of thousands of @entity84 , a persecuted religious minority group , have led from @entity54			2
deputy press spokesman @entity87 told reporters that the president would green - light such an operation , led by @entity92 , if commanders in the field recommended it			0
less than four hours later , reporters observed troops landing on the mountaintop			0
@entity0 , deputy national security adviser @entity99 said wednesday , is ' open to recommendations in which the @entity77 is helping to facilitate the removal of these people from the mountain on a humanitarian mission			0
' that rescue mission , he told reporters , ' is separate than saying @entity77 forces are going to be redeployed in @entity2 in a combat role to take the fight to [ @entity54 ]			0
' despite a busy series of negotiations and decision - trees , and the looking possible collapse of @entity2 , @entity0 remains on vacation			2
@entity17 ( @entity117 ) , like @entity0 and secretary of state @entity116 , are urging @entity2 leaders to form an inclusive government that could reduce sectarian tensions -- but he 's doing it alongside @entity2 deputy pm @entity121 , not from a beach villa missing in @entity38 : hero worship , @entity125 vacation style -- a crowd gathered to vie for a glimpse of @entity0 as he arrived for dinner at a @entity1 restaurant on tuesday he has logged barely one - third as many vacation days as president @entity130 did , but the timing of is being called into question			1
' even presidents need down time , and @entity0 can handle his commander - in - chief duties wherever he is , ' @entity12 columnist @entity134 wrote on monday			1
' but his decision to proceed with his getaway just 36 hours after announcing the military action in @entity2 risks fueling the impression that he is detached as the world burns			1
