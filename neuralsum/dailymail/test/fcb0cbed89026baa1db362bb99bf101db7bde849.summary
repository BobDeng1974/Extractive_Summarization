@entity1 's @entity0 gives his predictions ahead of the 79th masters at @entity4 on thursday			1
@entity5 so many to choose from but given @entity4 ’s predilection for a tale of redemption — from @entity9 ‘ kiss my ass ’ @entity10 to @entity12 ‘ this one ’s for you , @entity16 — let ’s go for the reformed party animal @entity15			1
time for him to prove he can match his gargantuan yardage off the tee with the requisite amount of brain cells			2
@entity15 watches his tee shot during a practice round on the @entity4 course on wednesday best @entity26 ( @entity25 ) not so many to choose from , alas			1
indeed , given @entity28 spent a week in bed with flu recently and reckons his strength is still low , we ’re almost empty - handed			1
still , let ’s hope the @entity33 can rise from his sick bed			2
other than that , it ’s time @entity38 returned to the limelight			0
@entity28 has only recently recovered from flu but the @entity33 will be hoping to mount a serious challenge best from the @entity42 let ’s leave out the history man on the grounds he has his own category			1
@entity47 has got an impressive recent record at @entity4 and @entity49 has shown he can play well here			0
but i have a feeling @entity52 is the most likely to join @entity53 and get into contention come sunday afternoon			0
@entity55 you can hardly have faith in @entity58 to emulate @entity59 and win a second masters in three years given he ’s confused enough on the greens to be going back to the long putter			0
while @entity16 sorts himself out , compatriot @entity63 has an outstanding chance to grab another win for @entity66			0
@entity63 has a great chance to become another @entity66 winner at the masters best each way bet when you think last year ’s joint runner - up @entity73 is 150 - 1 , there are some tasty odds out there			1
how about @entity77 at 80 - 1 ? or @entity78 to finish in the top six at 400 - 1 ? my particular favourite is three - time masters champ @entity82 at 25 - 1			1
@entity82 watches his fairway shot on the 11th green during his practice round on wednesday how will @entity53 do ? given what it would do for the sport and what an achievement it would represent , i fervently hope @entity59 is slipping a size 38 regular jacket on to @entity95 ’s shoulders come sunday night			1
but this might prove the major where he falls just short — and we have to wait a couple of years to enjoy his @entity100			2
prediction : third @entity95 will begin his quest for a @entity103 when the @entity104 kicks into action on thursday how will @entity106 do ? not as good as some @entity108 writers believe , who are fitting him up for his fifth green jacket already on the strength of shooting 33 for the front nine on a practice round on monday			2
not as bad as the doomsayers think either , though			0
he should make the halfway cut … and maybe scrape into the top 20			0
prediction : 19th @entity106 was joined by his girlfriend @entity117 ( left ) and his two children on the course on wednesday			0

@entity15 can prove himself at this year 's *tournament*
@entity28 has been ill but has the *quality* to impress
@entity82 , at 25 - 1 , is a good each - way bet for the title
