@entity0 can remember the time when she used to take advantage of the simplest pleasures in life without feeling breathless			2
now the 68 - year - old , who has a long history of smoking , counts herself lucky if she makes it back to her house from her backyard			2
even taking a shower leaves her exhausted			0
daughter and nurse @entity14 , of @entity16 , was the first to notice there was something terribly wrong with her mother who became short of breath with minimal physical activity			1
having a respiratory clinical background of 15 years , she knew straight away the diagnosis would be chronic obstructive pulmonary disease			1
@entity26 can exclusively reveal there 1.5 million @entity28 effected by the serious chronic lung disease - most of whom are from regional areas			1
in severe cases those suffering from @entity35 may need lung transplants and if detected too late it can ultimately lead to death , a @entity33 lung specialist said			1
ms @entity14 knew straight away her mum would be suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ms @entity0 , who used to regularly exercise back in the day , pictured with son @entity47 and daughter @entity48 ms @entity0 with her son , daughter and husband @entity49			1
they 've all been very supportive since ms @entity0 was diagnosed with @entity35 ms @entity0 says she used to be a very active person and used to go on daily 4km walks ms @entity14 was visiting her mother at her home in @entity57 , a suburb in the @entity59 region which is two hours north of @entity60 , when they decided to go for a walk			1
' when i go to visit mum and catch up with her it 's usually over coffee so i never noticed anything was wrong , ' she told @entity26			2
' then we were walking around together one day and she was quite breathless with the slightest amount of activity			0
that to me was evident that she had @entity35			2
' but when i told mum , she brushed it off saying it was just old age			0
' ms @entity0 admits she had been suffering from breathlessness for quite some time - one of the main symptoms of @entity35 - before her daughter urged her to see a doctor eight years ago			1
' i was getting all puffed out just going for short walks but i thought it was just because i was getting old , ' she told @entity26			0
' it 's getting worse now			0
i get worn out having a shower and i just ca n't go for walks anymore			0
' i 'm lucky if i make it to the clothesline and back			0
' this is an image of a healthy lung , unaffected by @entity35 which can cause breathlessness a damaged alveoli in the lung which is caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease having been a heavy smoker for more than 40 years , ms @entity0 decided it was finally time to quit her unhealthy habit			1
' the disease has completely changed my life and i 'm now so dependent on other people , ' she said			0
' i used to be very active in the past , especially because i do n't drive so i walked everywhere			0
i used to go on 4km walks every day			0
' it 's very frustrating and i feel useless			0
i ca n't even go for walks on the beach with my daughter or grandchildren			0
' but her daughter also attributes the cause of @entity35 to her mother 's dedication to her job as a weaving instructor at a local cotton mill for 30 years			1
' working at the factory and with all the airborne particles which she had been inhaling for all those years - that would be one of the other contributing cause , ' ms @entity14 said			1
most of the highest rating areas of @entity35 hospitalisation are in remote and regional @entity28 @entity122 's professor @entity121 - who 's also been a senior lung specialist for 20 years - says the main causes of @entity35 are smoking , air pollution and exposure excessive amounts of dust			1
professor @entity121 , of the @entity122 who 's also been a senior lung specialist for 20 years , says @entity35 is a type of chronic illness damage air passage and lungs			1
it is mostly associated with smokers in @entity28 but can also be caused by air pollution and excessive amounts of dust			1
the top three symptoms include : shortness of breath , bringing up phlegm when coughing and wheezing			0
the top three symptoms include breathlessness , bringing up phlegm when coughing and wheezing			0
' it 's a disease that tends to go unrecognised because many people see the symptoms as a sign of being unfit or getting old , ' he told @entity26			2
although @entity35 is typically common among those aged in their 60s , dr @entity121 says there 's an increasing number of younger patients suffering from the disease - in some cases needing a lung transplant			1
' the numbers are definitely increasing because we 're able to pick up @entity35 better and also people are living longer and exposed to more pollution , ' he said			1
' but also , these days , there 's an increase of younger patients aged 40 - 50 years who are coming to me			2
' a recent report from the @entity166 has revealed some of @entity28 's most @entity35 affected areas - most of which are remote parts of the nation			1
the difference between a healthy lung and one that 's affected by @entity35 - a chronic lung disease dr @entity121 believes smoking plays a major role in why more regional areas have @entity35			1
' there are studies showing that poorly educated and lower income areas have higher rates of smoking , ' he said			0
' so it can be seen that in regional areas @entity35 is higher because there are more smokers and less access to facilities to help smokers quit their habits , which also prevents early detection of the lung disease			1
' the @entity166 study showed there were 59,265 hospitalisations for @entity35 from 2011 to 2012 among @entity28 aged 55 and over			2
dr @entity121 says this ' is n't an economically smart way ' of dealing with the disease , which can be eased by medication if diagnosed early			2
@entity35 cost the government about $ 929 million from 2008 to 2009			1
the majority of this cost was for patients admitted to hospital , according to the @entity166 report			2
' people can avoid hospitalisation if detected early but in most cases it 's left too late so they need to be taken to through the emergency room , ' dr @entity121 said			0
' medication can help by slowing down the disease but can not cure it			0
people have to live with it for the rest of their lives			0
' in ms @entity0 's case , she has been taking @entity219 - a medication which has recently been reimbursed by the @entity221 - to help her with the symptoms during the morning and night			2
although she still faces limitations on a daily basis , ms @entity0 remains grateful for her daughter 's quick observation eight years ago			1
' @entity48 has been a godsend , ' she said			0
' she 's always looking out for me			0

@entity0 was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease eight years ago
daughter @entity14 , a nurse in @entity16 , realised her mum 's breathlessness was unusual
@entity35 is a long - term lung disease which affects 1.5 million @entity28
it also cost the government approximately $ 929 million in 2008 - 2009
the disease is linked with smokers in @entity28 but can also be caused by air pollution and dust
there 's an increasing number of patients being hospitalised with the disease *due* to late detection , especially in remote areas
