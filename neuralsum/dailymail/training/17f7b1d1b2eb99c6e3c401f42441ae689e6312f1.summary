to the locals who regularly enjoy a pint at the @entity2 in @entity3 , the @entity4 and @entity5 are a familiar sight			1
a few miles from the £ 7 million @entity9 home in @entity11 , the couple love the pub so much they even invited landlord @entity13 to their wedding in 2011			1
but now their quiet country evenings could be under threat after news emerged that mr @entity13 has applied for permission to turn the quaint village pub into a house			1
@entity3 is next door to @entity11 , where the pregnant @entity5 has been staying , while she recovers from a bout of severe morning sickness			1
locals say they regularly see the royal couple arrive with their armed protection team for a quiet meal in the pub. speaking ahead of the royal wedding in 2011 , landlord mr @entity13 said ' we ’re used to seeing @entity5 in the pub. ' the first time she and @entity23 came in it was nerve - racking , but you soon realise they ’re just a normal couple			1
' under threat : the 300 - year - old @entity2 , a favourite haunt of the couple , is at risk of closing popular : so loved is the @entity2 by the couple , landlord @entity13 was invited to the royal wedding in 2011 despite his royal clientele , mr @entity13 now says he wants to convert the 300 - year - old grade two listed building into a house			1
residents opposing the idea say it would ' cause irrevocable damage to the unique character of this beautiful village ' and they want @entity65 planners to reject it			0
mr @entity13 says the pub , which is still open , is no longer viable as a business			2
that claim has been questioned by some villagers , while @entity71 has taken the unusual step of calling for an independent review to assess the pub ’s viability			0
a statement from the council says ' the closure of the @entity2 would undoubtedly affect village life , and would prove a serious loss to many in the local community			2
' the financial trading data on the @entity2 has been withheld from the @entity84 , and therefore it is impossible to conclude anything about the pub ’s current viability , let alone its future prospects			2
celebration : locals are huge fans of the couple and regularly see them enjoying a quiet meal in the pub better : @entity95 has spent much of her time in @entity11 while recovering from morning sickness ' the review should involve discussions with members of the local community , and consider what investment might be required to sustain the pub in the future			2
' pending that review , our default position will be to oppose the change of use			0
we are also aware of what can be a very large differential between the value of the pub as a trading asset and its value as a residential dwelling			0
' villager @entity115 said ' i object to this change of use application as i believe that the boot is still viable as a pub. ' @entity122 has been an essential part of this community for 300 years and should not be closed			0
' close : the duchess is very close to her parents , @entity127 and @entity9 , who live in the village simple pleasures : the @entity4 and @entity5 are frequent visitors to the @entity2 another resident , @entity130 , said ' the @entity2 is a valuable village community asset and would be greatly missed			1
' the pub is well used and famed for royal patronage			0
the pub is viable with all other pubs in the general area appearing to be thriving			0
' the pub was the second stop on the @entity137 run by @entity139 - based coach travel firm @entity138 to show people places where the @entity5 has visited			1
@entity142 has been approached by the @entity143 for comment .			0

the @entity2 in @entity3 is a favourite of @entity5 and @entity23
they even invited landlord @entity13 to their wedding in 2011
now he wants to turn it into a house - but locals are campaigning to save it
they hope the @entity4 and @entity5 will support them
