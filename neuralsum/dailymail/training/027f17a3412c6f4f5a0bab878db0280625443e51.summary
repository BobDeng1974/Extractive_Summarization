@entity0 does strike twice : rep. @entity2 is the victim of an investing scam - and this is n't the first time he 's been swindled			1
mr @entity2 was cheated out of $ 18million by @entity13 , who cheated a total of 120 people out of $ 35million in the fraud			1
the revelations came as mr @entity13 was jailed monday for 12 years			1
this is not the first time fraudsters have taken advantage of the @entity22 @entity21			1
in 2009 , he won a $ 34million judgement against a separate firm running a nearly identical fraud			0
the scheme worked like this : clients would turn over their stocks to mr @entity13 as collateral for a loan , he would then let customers borrow about 90 per cent of the stocks ' value			2
if the stocks did badly , borrowers could walk away and keep the money they were loaned			0
but if the borrowers ' stocks did well , they would repay the loan with interest , and mr @entity13 was supposed to return the stocks to the investor at their increased value			2
mr @entity2 's stocks performed astronomically well while they were entrusted to mr @entity13 and his company , @entity47			1
this is where the scheme began to unravel - mr @entity13 sold the stocks and had no way to fulfill his obligations - the self - styled investment guru had no way to make successful investors whole , prosecutors said			1
' that 's why [ mr @entity13 ] is going to prison for a long , long time , ' said mr @entity2			1
' at least in the end , some kind of justice was served			0
' in most of the court papers , mr @entity2 's identity is protected — prosecutors say only that an elected official with the initials @entity2 was the primary victim — but documents twice mention @entity2 by name			1
the @entity72 congressman on monday confirmed he is the @entity73 mentioned in the documents			0
taken down : @entity13 was charged with fraud after an @entity77 investigation nothing in the court papers suggests mr @entity2 was anything but a victim of the scheme			1
lawyers for the congressman said it was the strength of his stocks that caused the scheme to crumble			0
the two men negotiated a payment plan , according to court records , but it was not enough to keep mr @entity13 's positions from collapsing			2
in 2007 , @entity2 had $ 9.35 million in a stock portfolio that @entity13 was supposed to be holding as collateral			1
in that year alone , the portfolio 's value increased by 147 per cent , to $ 23 million , according to a chart in the court documents			0
' because the return on @entity2 's commodities investments were so astronomical , @entity47 could not meet its obligations under the loan agreements ' defense lawyer @entity101 wrote			0
mr @entity2 has a long record of successfully picking stocks , many of which have contributed to his fortune			2
the con artist instead used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle including a @entity112 , a @entity113 and a $ 3 million home , prosecutors said			2
mr @entity13 , of @entity115 , @entity116 , pleaded guilty in may but tried at friday 's sentencing hearing to withdraw the plea , saying he felt pressured to plead and that he never intended to defraud			0
he is not the first stock scammer to take advantage of mr @entity2			2
double trouble : mr @entity2 also fell for a similar scheme only a few years ago , that once cost him almost twice as much as the latest fraud in 2009 , mr @entity2 won a $ 34 million judgment after filing a lawsuit in @entity127 under federal racketeering laws against a company called @entity130			1
@entity130 's business plan for hedging an investor 's stock profile was nearly identical to the plan outline by mr @entity13			0
mr @entity2 said he first entered into deals with mr @entity13 in 2003 , well before the deal with @entity137 went south , so he had no reason to be suspicious of the arrangement			1
the loans themselves were a perfectly reasonable way to manage his portfolio , but relied on mr @entity13 and @entity137 to hold up their end of the bargain , he said , disputing that the astronomical returns to which he was entitled caused mr @entity13 's downfall			0
' if they had not sold the collateral , it all would have worked , ' he explained , who is generally listed as one of the 20 wealthiest members of @entity155 with assets of more than $ 20 million			0
his financial disclosure forms list holdings in dozens of stocks			0
his dealings with mr @entity13 preceded his time in @entity155 , which began in 2009			0
court records indicate mr @entity13 's firm was drawing regulatory scrutiny as early as 2007			0
before he was elected to @entity155 , mr @entity2 practiced law and was best known for winning a major whistleblower lawsuit exposing fraud on a government contract in @entity169 .			1

@entity7 rep. @entity2 ( @entity3 ) was one of 120 people who lost a total of $ 35million in the scheme
mr @entity2 lost $ 18million , making him the biggest victim
@entity13 , the con artist behind the latest fraud to snare mr @entity2 , has been jailed for 12 years
the @entity22 @entity21 fell for the same exact fraud scheme only a few years ago - that one cost him even more
