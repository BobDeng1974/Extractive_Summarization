@entity0 mp @entity0 has been summoned to meet party enforcers next week to explain the comments about the holocaust he posted on his website a @entity0 mp facing disciplinary action after accusing ' the @entity6 ' of atrocities against @entity8 has issued a public apology for causing ' unintended offence			1
' @entity0 's comments - posted on his website ahead of tomorrow 's @entity12 - were condemned by party chiefs and sparked a furious backlash			1
he initially strongly defended the article and hit out at criticisms by the party - which summoned him to the @entity18 for a meeting on monday morning			1
but in a new post this afternoon he said he ' never for a moment intended to criticise or offend the @entity6 people as a whole , either as a race or as a people of faith , and apologise sincerely for the unintended offence which my words caused			0
' ' i recognise of course the deep sensitivities of these issues at all times , and particularly on occasions of commemoration such as this weekend , ' he added			0
mr @entity0 said that in raising the treatment of the @entity8 he had simply been ' trying to make clear that everybody needs to learn the lessons of the @entity3			2
' ' i will continue to make criticisms of actions in @entity42 in the strongest possible terms for as long as @entity44 continues to oppress the @entity46 people , ' he added			1
the @entity48 mp composed his original posting after signing a @entity3 memorial book in the city , describing @entity52 as ' the @entity54 concentration and extermination camp which is the site of the largest mass murder in history			1
' this week prime minister @entity59 signed a book of remembrance to mark @entity12 in @entity62 but in the addition which caused the uproar , he added : ' having visited @entity52 twice - once with my family and once with local schools - i am saddened that the @entity6 , who suffered unbelievable levels of persecution during the @entity3 , could within a few years of liberation from the death camps be inflicting atrocities on @entity8 in the new @entity44 and continue to do so on a daily basis in the @entity74 and @entity75			1
' a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ this is a matter we take extremely seriously			0
the @entity0 deeply regret and condemn the statement issued by @entity0 and his use of language which is unacceptable			0
’ @entity12 marks the 68th anniversary of the liberation of the @entity52 concentration camp , where more than one million people , mostly @entity6 , were killed – many shot , starved or victims of the gas chambers			0
homosexuals , political dissidents and the handicapped were also victims			0
horror : @entity12 marks the 68th anniversary of the liberation of the @entity52 concentration camp , where more than one million people , mostly @entity6 , were killed the mp , who said he had attended a holocaust memorial event in @entity93 yesterday which was ‘ extremely moving ’ said he hoped the chief whip would respect his views			2
in an interview yesterday he said : ‘ what better day to raise the issue of learning from one of the worst examples of inhumanity			0
’ he told the commentator website : ‘ it appears that the suffering by the @entity6 has not transformed their views on how others should be treated			0
’ on his website , mr @entity0 said he had ‘ signed a book of commitment in the @entity110 , in doing so pledging his commitment to @entity12 ’ and describes @entity52 as ‘ the @entity54 concentration and extermination camp which is the site of the largest mass murder in history			0
’ @entity118 , chief executive of the @entity119 , said : ‘ i am deeply saddened that at this sombre time , when we remember those who were murdered by the @entity122 , mr @entity0 has deliberately abused the memory of the @entity3 causing deep pain and offence - these comments are sickening and unacceptable and have no place in @entity130 politics			1
’ @entity0 leader @entity131 is understood to be furious with mr @entity0 and condemned his remarks @entity133 , chief executive of the @entity134 , said : ‘ we are outraged and shocked at these offensive comments about @entity6 victims of the @entity3 and the suggestion that @entity6 should have learned a lesson from the experience			1
‘ for an mp to have made such comments on the eve of @entity12 is even more distasteful , and we welcome the fact that the @entity0 have sought to disassociate the party from @entity0 's comments			1
’ @entity147 mp @entity146 said his comments were ‘ a tragic trivialisation of real evil			1
’ he said ‘ it should be remembered that @entity44 withdrew from @entity75 completely and yet has faced a barrage of 7000 + missiles from @entity154 and been the victim of hundreds of terrorist suicide bombers and been attacked by all its neighbours in 1948 , 1967 and 1973			2
’ mr @entity0 has previously described @entity44 as an ‘ apartheid regime ’			2

in 2004 , she claimed she might become a suicide bomber if she lived in the @entity74 or @entity75 , and was sacked as the party ’s spokesman on children ’s issues			0
she was sacked as health spokesman in 2010 for accusing @entity44 soldiers of harvesting body parts in @entity171 while doing humanitarian work after the earthquake , and this year said ‘ @entity44 is not going to be there forever			2
