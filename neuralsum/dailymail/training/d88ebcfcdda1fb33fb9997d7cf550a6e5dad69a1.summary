a former @entity1 star has filed a suit against the state of @entity4 for not executing the man who murdered his mother , sister and two nephews 30 years ago			1
@entity9 , the @entity10 defensive back who was known for his aggressive play on the field , is about to get aggressive in the courtroom as a @entity15 judge has ruled he does have standing to bring forward a suit demanding that @entity4 put in place a protocol to end the life of the man who killed his family			1
that man , @entity22 , not only knew @entity9 , but the former @entity1 star coached him in @entity24 football			1
' the people of @entity4 have said over and over again that they want this kind of punishment for the worst criminals			2
' he then added ; ' i do n't like people getting in the way of the rule of law			0
' @entity22 ( above ) , a gang member who @entity9 coached in youth football , was found guilty of the murders and sentenced to death in 1986 this case comes at a time when @entity4 has 750 inmates on death row , more than any other state in the country			1
almost all of their cases are being held up as a result of strong political opposition and ongoing litigation			0
in fact , since the state approved the death penalty in 1978 , only 13 inmates were executed before a judge halted lethal injections , citing the excruciating pain they chemicals caused			0
this does not matter to @entity9 though , a man who worked hard to change his situation after being born one of 11 children to @entity28 of @entity72 , @entity4			1
after a successful career , he had come back to @entity72 , which had become a violent area , and created a youth football program to get kids off the street			2
that is when he first encountered @entity22 , who he saw as an angry young man , much like @entity9 himself was at that age			2
years later , @entity22 was found guilty of walking into the home of mrs. @entity28 and shooting her as she sat at the kitchen table , drinking coffee in her nightgown			1
from there he shot 23 - year - old @entity88 in the eyes as she sat up in her bed , and mrs. @entity28 's two grandchildren , 8 - year - old @entity92 and 10 - year - old @entity93 , as they were asleep in their beds			0
he was sentenced to death in 1986			0
@entity9 points out that it is not that he wants to see @entity22 put to death for what he did so much as he wants the man who murdered his family to be punished in the way a jury determined			1
' it 's not about the revenge , ' he said			0
' it 's about the law			0
' @entity9 played ten seasons in the @entity1 - mostly for the @entity10			2
he retired from the league in 1973			0

@entity9 , a former defensive back for the @entity10 , lost his mother , sister and two nephews when they were murdered in 1984
@entity22 , a gang member whom @entity9 coached in youth football , was found guilty of the murders and sentenced to death in 1986
the state of @entity4 has not executed @entity22 yet so @entity9 has filed a lawsuit asking them to put in place a protocol for when his life will end
@entity9 says it has nothing to do with revenge , he just wants the law to be *carried* out
his sister and two nephews were sleeping when they were killed , while his mother , @entity28 , was sipping coffee in her nightgown at the table
there are 750 people on death row in @entity4 , more than any other state , and no one has been put to death since 2006
