it may seem the perfect @entity2 prank , but astronomers say they have spotted a mysterious ' eye ' on @entity5			2
the giant eye appears to be looking directly at the @entity8 space telescope , which captured the image			1
however , @entity10 says that in fact the image shows a shadow over a storm			1
lokking right back at you : on april 21 , 2014 , when @entity8 was being used to monitor changes in @entity19 's immense @entity18 ( @entity18 ) storm , a shadow caused this ' eye ' to appear			1
during the exposures , the shadow of the @entity23 swept across the center of the @entity26 gave the giant planet the uncanny appearance of having a pupil in the center of a 10,000 - mile - diameter ' eye			1
' a bizarre six - sided storm churning @entity5 ’s north pole has flummoxed astronomers ever since it was first spotted thirty years ago			2
now , astronomers believe they may have solved one of its biggest mysteries by working out how it operates - and discovering the rotation period of @entity5 in the process			0
the giant storm operates rather like the jet stream on @entity44 they say - explaining why it never appears to move			1
the image was taken on april 21 , 2014 , when @entity8 was being used to monitor changes in @entity19 's immense @entity18 ( @entity49 ) storm			1
during the exposures , the shadow of the @entity23 swept across the center of the @entity18			1
this gave the giant planet the uncanny appearance of having a pupil in the center of a 10,000 - mile - diameter ' eye			1
' ' for a moment , @entity19 ' stared ' back at @entity8 like a one - eyed @entity58 , ' @entity10 said			1
it is one of many unusual storms on @entity5			0

the unusual structure with a hexagonal shape surrounding @entity5 's north pole was spotted on the planet for the first time thirty years ago			2
this bizarre six - sided storm churning @entity5 ’s north pole has flummoxed astronomers ever since it was first spotted thirty years ago			0
the hexagon is a wavy jet stream of 200 mph winds and spans 20,000 miles ( 30,000 kilometers ) across - more than twice the diameter of @entity44			0
nothing similar with such a regular geometry had ever been seen on any planet in the @entity85			0
the @entity86 has now been able to study and measure the phenomenon and , establish its rotation period , and that of @entity5 - the only planet in the @entity85 whose rotation time remains unknown			0
researchers found seasonal variations do not affect the hexagon and its jet stream at all , so concluded both are part of an extensive wave , deeply rooted in @entity5 's atmosphere			0
the latest images gave the giant planet the uncanny appearance of having a pupil in the center of a 10,000 - mile - diameter ' eye			2
' ' for a moment , @entity19 ' stared ' back at @entity8 like a one - eyed @entity58 , ' @entity10 said			1
the @entity109 / @entity108 researchers suggest that the hexagon and its stream are the manifestation of a ' @entity113 ' similar to those that form in the mid-latitudes of the earth			0
on our planet the jet stream meanders from west to east and brings , associated with it , the system of areas of low pressure and anticyclones which we have been seeing regularly on weather maps			0
on @entity5 , a hydrogen gas planet , ten times the size of the @entity44 , cold in its upper clouds , without a solid surface , and with an atmosphere as deep as that of an ocean , ' the hexagonal wavy motion of the jet stream is expected to be propagated vertically and reveal to us aspects of the planet ’s hidden atmosphere , ' said @entity142 , head of the @entity144 research group .			0
