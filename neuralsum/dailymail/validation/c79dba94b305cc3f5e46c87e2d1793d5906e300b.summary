and at the end of the day , she has to do the entire journey in reverse , before picking them up from a childminder			0
she eventually gets the children home at around 8pm - 13 hours after they leave the house every morning			2
mrs @entity6 said : ' it 's awful at the moment			2
we are under a lot of stress			0
' the kids are always sleeping in the car on the way			0
' the family estimate they spend around £ 2,000 a month on the school run - or £ 100 per school day			1
every day they have to pay for : more than 50 miles worth of petrol : costing £ 5 to £ 10 a day parking at @entity53 : £ 4 return train ticket from @entity53 to @entity55 : £ 21.70 childminder : £ 20 at approx. £ 5 per hour nursery : £ 35 - £ 50 per day breakfast club for two children : £ 5 total : minimum spend of £ 95 per day mrs @entity6 and recruitment manager husband @entity20 , 30 , have already spent around £ 12,000 on the school run since @entity9 started in september			1

now the couple are so fed up with the daily grind that they have decided they have no choice but to sell their £ 400,000 home and move closer to the school			2
a spokesman for @entity80 refused to comment on the case specifically			0
the spokesman said : ' @entity80 is responsible for ensuring that children applying for a @entity30 school are offered a school place			0
' in common with the rest of @entity8 we have had exceptionally high demand for reception places and have worked hard to provide all parents who applied on time with an optimal school place			0
' the high demand means that proximity to school criteria may have a small radius , particularly in a year with large numbers of siblings			0
' the pan-london admissions scheme distributes places in a scrupulously fair and transparent way based on the eligibility criteria including the applicant 's permanent address and the number of places available at each school			0
' many schools are over-subscribed and can not offer to all who apply , and only reach limited distances under the proximity criteria			0
' the family say they spend £ 100 a day on petrol , train tickets , parking , childminder , breakfast club and nursery			1
