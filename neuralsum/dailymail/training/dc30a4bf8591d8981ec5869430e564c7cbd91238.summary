@entity1 's chief constable @entity0 will not be allowed to retire until an investigation into alleged gross misconduct is completed a police force has performed a major u-turn after its chief constable announced his early retirement while under investigation for gross misconduct			1
@entity0 said on wednesday that he was stepping down in may from his role as chief constable of @entity12 , three years before his contract was due to end			1
it appeared his decision had been accepted after the force released a statement with a glowing tribute			0
but after @entity21 raised questions , it was later announced mr @entity0 will stay in post until the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) finishes its investigation			1
last night the @entity24 said : ‘ it is our view that mr @entity0 should not be allowed to retire while our investigation is ongoing and before the conclusion of any proceedings that may follow			1
’ mr @entity0 , 57 , was appointed in january 2013 on a five - year contract			0
he is paid £ 144,799			0
last summer he was reported to the police watchdog over serious allegations dating back to 2009 – when he was assistant chief constable – about complaints made in respect of a sexual abuse case			1
in september , the @entity24 said that mr @entity0 was accused of having ‘ withheld information and misled the complainants ’			2
at the time the chief said he was ‘ shocked ’ but would co-operate with the inquiry			0
however , early last week , @entity1 said mr @entity0 had informed the force of ‘ his decision to retire in may ’ on monday and thanked him for his ‘ hard work ’			2
then , on friday , after being questioned by this newspaper , the force issued a statement saying : ‘ [ @entity50 ] has committed to remaining in post until the ongoing @entity24 investigation in which he is involved is concluded			0
’ had the retirement gone ahead it would have angered home secretary @entity55 , who has just passed a law to stop officers escaping justice by quitting while facing disciplinary action .			0
