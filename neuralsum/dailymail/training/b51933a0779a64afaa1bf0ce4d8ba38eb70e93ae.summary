here ’s to health and wellbeing with the new year in mind			1
@entity5 lifts a glass to the benefits of juicing the beauty benefits @entity5 i ’ve been singing the praises of juicing for 30 years and i ’m more excited than ever to share in my new book ( see page 66 ) the many varied health , beauty and wellbeing benefits			1
to give you an introductory flavour , the recipes on these pages include some of my favourite beauty and skin - boosting juices			1
beauty , like health , comes from within , so what we eat plays a vital role			1
good skincare can help us look good on the outside , but nothing will last if it does n’t also come from within			1
sparkling eyes , clear , glowing skin , vim and vigour are all signs of a healthy working system			1
raw fruit and vegetable juices aid the body ’s natural functions of cleansing and repair to keep us looking young and feeling great			1
they are also bursting with vitamins , minerals and other very valuable micronutrients that help build stronger , clearer and more youthful - looking skin			1
fruit and vegetables – especially the most colourful kind – are key here			2
the pigments in fresh produce correlate to the nutritional compounds contained within ; for example , the orange colour of carrots , apricots and mangoes means a rich source of carotene , while the red , purply blue tones of cherries , blueberries and red cabbage come from antioxidant - rich anthocyanins			2
these nutrients are particularly useful when it comes to preserving our collagen and elastin fibres , the springy network of elastic tissues that gives skin its youthful plumped - up glow			2
choose your blitz kit on the subject of juicers , the centrifugal kind fits the bill			2
these work by means of a rapidly spinning blade and centrifugal force whizzing around a central cavity , forcing pulp one way and juice the other			2
most kitchen appliance brands have their own versions ( some brands make several different varieties )			2
the main difference tends to be the power of the motor – the more powerful the machine , the faster it will juice			0
the more powerful machines may also be slightly better built , as they need a sturdier housing for the motor			0
they can be a good investment if you ’re intending to juice on a daily basis , as , being more robust , they tend to have a longer working life			0
much has been written about the benefits of ‘ slow juicers ’ which – as their name suggests – crush fruit and veg in a slower way , more akin to a cold - pressing action			0
the theory is that this preserves nutritional values by avoiding excess heat in the blades , but research has shown that high - speed juicers are more efficient at extracting the juice ( and therefore higher levels of nutrients ) , so may be a better option			0
my favourite juicing machine is one with a high - powered motor and wide feeding tube to accommodate whole apples and larger pieces of veg – which also saves time chopping			0
