by @entity0 last updated at 3:37 pm on 2nd december 2011 traveller families who were living illegally on the @entity3 site have been warned they will be charged £ 80,000 each to cover the cost of their eviction			1
@entity6 will demand the families living on the 52 plots pay just over £ 4million between them			1
the families were removed from the six - acre site near @entity11 , @entity12 , after a 10 - year planning row			2
@entity3 eviction day : police use a cherry picker to talk to protesters			2
each of the 52 families will be billed for £ 80,000 to cover the costs a council source said it would be likely to seek ownership of the land as there is little chance of the traveller families producing the money			1
' there is more chance of getting blood from a stone than the travellers handing over money for being thrown off their land , ' he said			1
' i think realistically , what we will see is the council will take ownership of the land and it will become a council asset			1
' the final use of the site has not been decided but there has been talk of it becoming allotments			0
' council leader @entity47 said : ' some travellers will pay more than others , as there were buildings which had to be removed , requiring more work to do			0
' the £ 4million cost was just half of the £ 8million bill expected if activists had dug their heels in and held out against the bailiffs for months in the ' @entity59 '			1
a protester holds up a cross in front of a barricade during the eviction at the @entity3 site in @entity11 in october police use @entity67 as they break through a barricade during evictions from @entity3 as it turned out , travellers who had pledged to ' fight to the death ' walked away from the former scrapyard just two days after the eviction began in october			0
@entity66 has yet to finalise the costs of the eviction but it is anticipated they too will come in well under the budget of £ 10million			1
the @entity3 site remains blocked off and any families moving back onto the land have been warned they could be arrested			2
last month dozens of caravans returned to the site , sparking fears that the council could be left facing another long battle to remove them			0
but many of the families are now living on plots on the legal part of the @entity3 site - just 200 yards from where they were evicted			0
enforcement : council workers arrive with injunction notices after the courts ruled the eviction could go ahead following a 10 - year legal battle others in touring caravans are still parked up on the roadway leading to the site			0
former @entity3 resident @entity103 , 42 , a mother - of - three , said : ' people have nowhere to turn to			0
this is home for them , @entity105 is home			1
@entity12 is home so that is why we are still here			0
' it is getting cold now and people are starting to suffer and that is why the families did not want to return to a life on the road			0
' we have kids , it 's not a life for them in these conditions			2

@entity105 's *futile* attempt to *recoup* £ 4million
' likely to take control of land ' instead
