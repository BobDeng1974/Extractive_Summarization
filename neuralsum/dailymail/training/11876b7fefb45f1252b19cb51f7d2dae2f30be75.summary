three conservative mps are undertaking their own ballots of voters on membership of the @entity4 that are almost identical to those carried by two @entity7 defectors			1
with @entity9 on high alert ahead of an expected byelection defeat to @entity7 tomorrow , it emerged that staunch eurosceptics @entity12 , @entity14 and @entity15 are canvassing constituents on whether they want to be in or out of the @entity4			1
both of the conservatives who have jumped ship to @entity7 , @entity21 and @entity22 , conducted similar exercises before announcing their defections			1
they are all thought to have been advised by an anti-eu campaigner with longstanding links to @entity7			2
@entity40 worked for mr @entity21 in the months before his defection at the end of august , and had previously been employed by mr @entity22 , who jumped ship at the end of september			1
mr @entity12 , mr @entity14 and mr @entity15 have all firmly denied any intention to defect to @entity7			1
but the revelation of links between their local ballots on the @entity4 and those carried out by mr @entity21 and mr @entity22 will heighten @entity27 jitters ahead of this week ’s @entity52 and @entity53 byelection			1
senior @entity54 concede mr @entity22 currently appears on course to hold the @entity57 seat he previously represented for the @entity54 for @entity7 on thursday			1
but they hope other potential defectors will be deterred by the latest poll in the constituency , which puts @entity7 on course for victory but suggests the @entity54 will retake the seat by a narrow margin in next may ’s general election			0
a new survey by @entity66 for @entity67 shows 30 per cent of people say they would only vote for their current mp if they stay with their current party @entity73 , visiting the seat again to campaign yesterday , told any more mps considering defecting : ‘ the point i make to everybody is that these things are entirely counter-productive			0
‘ if you want a referendum on @entity82 's future in @entity83 , the only way to get that is to make sure there 's a @entity9 government and to make sure that it ’s me leading the country and not @entity90			0
‘ doing things that distract from that make the chance of an in - out referendum less likely so it ’s entirely counter-productive			0
that 's the argument i have made , and the argument i 'll continue to make			0
’ a new opinion poll today showed just one in 13 ( 7 per cent ) adults would vote for their current local mp if they joined @entity7 , even though they would not normally vote for @entity7			2
it suggests very few @entity75 can expect to take their voters with them if they choose to defect			0
@entity102 , deputy managing director of communications firm @entity67 , said : ' for any mps with itchy feet , these polls will be a bit of a wake - up call			0
' @entity22 carried out a similar local ballot in @entity52 and @entity53 before he defected to @entity7			1
he is expected to win the by - election in the seat tomorrow @entity21 , pictured with @entity7 leader @entity111 , made political history by becoming @entity7 's first elected mp in october after defecting from the conservatives mr @entity12 , mp for @entity115 , told the @entity116 that unspecified ‘ private donors ’ were funding his referendum on @entity4 membership , being conducted jointly with mr @entity14 , mp for neighbouring @entity119 , and @entity120 , the conservative candidate for @entity121			1
‘ yes , the original referendum leaflet was a crib of the one that @entity22 did , ’ mr @entity12 said			1
‘ the person who has organised it and promoted it was the same guy that did the reckless one			0
‘ this was signed off and approved at the highest level of the party a long time before mr @entity22 went to @entity7			1
’ asked if he was considering defecting , the mp insisted : ‘ i deny that 10,000 per cent			0
i have been a member of the @entity27 since i was 15			0
i believe we should have a pact with @entity7 [ but ] i have never had an discussions with anyone in @entity7 about defecting			2
’ in a reference to the charm offensive launched by former @entity7 treasurer @entity140 , who has attempted to woo potential defectors , mr @entity12 joked : ‘ i have n’t even been invited to lunch			2
i ’ve spoken to @entity14 about it and he has no intention of defecting either			2
’ the mp added : ‘ i would like to see the @entity27 put forward the policies that will win us the next election : ending free movement of citizens into this country , the @entity148 committing to leading the out campaign if he does n’t get what he wants in the @entity4 renegotiation , and i would like to see an end to the coalition			0
’ mr @entity15 said there was ‘ absolutely no way , under no circumstances whatsoever ’ that he would switch to @entity7 , despite conceding his ballot of constituents on @entity4 membership was ‘ very similar ’ to those carried out by the defectors			1
‘ this has always been a @entity167 part of the world and the idea is to give my constituents an opportunity of expressing a view , ’ he said			0
prime minister @entity73 yesterday insisted the only way to get a referendum on @entity82 's future in @entity83 was to vote @entity9 , as he campaigned in @entity176 with @entity27 candidate @entity177 however , mr @entity15 confirmed he had had ‘ an approach ’ from @entity7 about standing down their candidate in his constituency of @entity182 in exchange for @entity7 being allowed a free run in neighbouring @entity185 , one of its top targets			1
‘ from a purely selfish point of view , that would be quite welcome , but i ca n’t deliver it			0
even if the local party was willing to do it , we ’re a national party and we will have a candidate in every seat , ’ he said			0
@entity196 , co-founder of the cross-party @entity4 referendum campaign the @entity197 , said : ‘ that more conservative mps are consulting their local voters on @entity4 membership in such a similar style to previous @entity7 defectors should ring alarm bells in @entity203			1
‘ @entity73 needs to reassure his backbenchers with an undertaking that , as a constitutional question about how @entity82 is governed , he will allow them free rein without party recrimination to campaign for either side in an @entity4 referendum			2
‘ after nearly 40 years of @entity4 rule changes since we last voted and the @entity215 estimating that up to 53 per cent of @entity82 laws now have their origins in @entity4 institutions , there is no democratic justification for any party to still refuse to hold an @entity4 referendum			2

@entity12 , @entity14 and @entity15 carrying out local ballots
they are canvassing constituents on whether @entity82 should leave the @entity4
@entity21 and @entity22 carried out polls before defecting
all three deny they are planning to leave the conservatives for @entity7
