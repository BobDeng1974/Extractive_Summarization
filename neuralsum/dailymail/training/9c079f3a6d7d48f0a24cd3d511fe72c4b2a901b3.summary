by @entity0 for @entity1 a diet laden with burgers and fries , dripping with sweet treats and saturated in pies could kill our appetite for healthy foods , scientists warn			2
a new @entity12 study has found living on junk food not only makes rats fat , but also suppresses their desires to eat a balanced diet			1
scientists believe their findings help explain how excessive consumption of unhealthy foods , can change a person 's behaviour , weaken their self - control and lead to overeating and obesity			1
' it 's like you 've just had ice cream for lunch , yet you still go and eat more when you hear the ice cream van come by			2
' the team of researchers taught young male rats to associate each of two different sound cues with a particular flavour of sugar water , cherry and grape			0
rats raised on a healthy diet stopped responding to cues linked to a flavour , in which they had recently overindulged			1
this inborn mechanism , widespread in animals , protects against overeating and helps promote a healthy , balanced diet			0
but after two weeks eating a daily diet rich with cafeteria foods , including pie , dumplings , cookies and cake - with 150 per cent more calories - the rats ' weight increased by 10 per cent			2
at the same time , researchers noted their behaviour had also changed dramatically			0
they became indifferent in their food choices and no longer avoided the sound advertising the over-familiar taste			0
the team of researchers deduced this indicated they had lost their natural preference for healthy foods			0
they noted the change lasted for some time after the rats returned to a healthy diet			1
professor @entity37 said : ' the interesting thing about this finding is that if the same thing happens in humans , eating junk food may change our responses to signals associated with food rewards ' the team concluded a diet of junk food causes lasting changes in the reward circuit parts of the rats ' brain , including the orbitofrontal cortex - an area of the brain responsible for decision - making			1
they said the findings may have implications for people 's ability to limit their intake of certain kinds of foods , because the brain 's reward ciruits are similar in all mammals			0
the @entity122 has estimated that more than 10 per cent of the world 's adult population is obese			1
who said at least 2.8 million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese - which are major risk factors for a number of chronic diseases including diabetes , heart disease and cancer			1
dr @entity134 , lead author of the paper , said : ' as the global obesity epidemic intensifies , advertisements may have a greater effect on people who are overweight and make snacks like chocolate bars harder to resist			0
' the findings were reported in the journal @entity142 .			0

@entity12 study found living on junk food makes rats fat - but also suppresses their desire to eat a healthy diet
scientists believe it changes a person 's behaviour and weakens self - control
@entity122 estimates more than 10 *%* of world 's population is obese and 2.8 million people each year from the *condition*
