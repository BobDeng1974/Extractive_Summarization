doctors and nurses should apologise to patients when mistakes are made to win back trust in the @entity6 , the health secretary has said			1
@entity7 said @entity6 staff had become ‘ defensive ’ and were inclined not to say sorry to patients and relatives for fear of being sued			1
new guidance sent to the hospitals in @entity14 and @entity15 tells staff that saying sorry is not admitting legal liability but is ‘ the right thing to do ’			1
doctors and nurses are to be told that apologising is not admitting legal liability but is the right thing to do ( file picture ) mr @entity7 said he would like to see ‘ an open @entity6 culture ’ that ‘ learns when things go wrong ’			1
he told @entity24 : ‘ saying sorry and supporting patients and their families when they have experienced harm is a really important part of this			2
it ’s great to see staff being supported to do the right thing			1
‘ sadly , under the last @entity34 a closed and defensive culture developed in parts of the @entity6			1
we are transforming this culture through a new transparency drive in our hospitals			2
’ to address these concerns – including the @entity42 scandal where 1,200 patients died – the @entity38 ( @entity39 ) has produced a four - page leaflet for staff entitled ‘ saying sorry ’			2
it says a face - to - face apology must be given as soon as an incident has occurred			0
‘ a written apology , which clearly states the healthcare organisation is sorry for the suffering and distress resulting from the incident , must also be given , ’ it says			0
the leaflet explains that saying sorry is not an admission of liability , adding : ‘ @entity57 is not an insurer and we will never withhold cover for a claim because an apology or explanation has been given			0
‘ officials want to prevent a repeat of the poor care and culture at @entity67 where 1,200 patients died @entity68 , chief executive of the @entity39 , said : ‘ saying sorry is the human and moral thing to do , we wo n’t say we ’re not going to cover you because you ’ve said sorry			1
‘ in cases where people perhaps bring a claim out of frustration , because they do n’t feel that they ’ve been given an explanation or that their complaints have been heard , an apology may make them less likely to pursue an action			0
‘ we actively support organisations being open , transparent and candid with their patients			0
we have seen some cases where that has n’t happened in the @entity6			1
it ’s important that we create and support the right culture			0
it can win back people ’s trust			0
’ the amount set aside by the @entity6 to compensate patients for medical blunders has soared by nearly a quarter between 2012 and 2013			2
health secretary @entity7 said he would like to see ' an open @entity6 culture ' that ' learns when things go wrong ' a total of £ 22.7billion has been reserved to deal with thousands of clinical negligence claims			1
the number of claims rose by 11 per cent in 2012 to 10,129 in 2013 with some payouts of around £ 5million			0
the figures , published in the annual report of the @entity38 , are an estimate based on the number of claims the @entity6 believes it will be unable to defend , how severe errors are , and how much victims should receive			2
the report shows that by 2012/13 , the estimate had risen to £ 22.7billion , up 22 per cent from £ 18.6billion			0
official figures show that 104 negligence claims have succeeded against the @entity67 over the past four years .			0

apologising does not mean admitting legal liability , staff told
guidance to health trusts *insists* saying sorry is the ' right thing to do '
@entity7 , the health secretary , wants to end ' defensive ' culture in @entity6
