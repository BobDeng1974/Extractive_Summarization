he weighted just 1lb 6oz at birth , and his eyelids were still fused shut			0

with a large family - @entity11 has five brothers and sisters - and a bucket list that covers several countries , the @entity110 have been holding fundraisers to pay for some trips , and others have been provided by generous donors			1

family fun : on each trip , including one to meet @entity83 's astronauts , @entity11 is accompanied with his five brothers and sisters , and parents kit and @entity27 adventure : doctors suggest to @entity11 's parents that they let him experience as many things as possible before losing his sight fighter : @entity11 weighed just over 1lb when he was born more than four months early			1

when he woke on the first day , @entity11 was able to see the spires of @entity146 from his hotel room			2
during the trip he was picked at @entity73 's store to let a wand choose him			0
' he was so excited , i cried seeing his expression , ' ms @entity39 wrote on a blog about the day trip			0
' you try a few wands that cause funny mishaps ( boxes flying off shelves , flowers dying ) and then the correct wand chooses the child – complete with spotlight and music and burst of air blowing the child ’s hair up			0
it was so fun ! ' some of his bucket list wishes were more straightforward			0
the technology fan wanted to visit an @entity174 store			0
generous : when @entity11 asked to visit an @entity176 , the staff gave him a yellow @entity177 and an @entity178 original : some of the bucket list trips are more unusual , such as this one to see a water tower nature : @entity11 feeds a cockatiel during a visit to a wildlife park but when his parents reached out to a store , they not only welcomed @entity11 in and gave him one of the yellow t - shirts their genius teams wear , they also gave him an @entity178 filled with apps to help those who are visually impaired			1
he has also visited a water tower , watched books being made , visited farm animals and @entity198			0
one of the more memorable trips was to @entity83 , where @entity11 and his family got to meet astronauts , tour mission control and listen to astronauts in the space station			2
' [ @entity83 ] gave him an experience beyond his wildest dreams in so many ways			0
none of us could have imagined how incredible our visit would be , ' ms @entity39 said , adding that @entity11 had been ' given him memories that will stay with him forever '			1
