for male chimpanzees , there may be a benefit to being a bully			0
a study of chimpanzees in @entity6 spanning 17 years found that males that subjected females to long - term aggressive behavior , often including physical attacks , greatly improved their chances of fathering babies with them			1
' it is certainly not a happy message , ' said @entity17 evolutionary anthropologist @entity16 , one of the researchers			2
scientists said a 17 - year study of chimpanzees in @entity6 's @entity30 found that males that subjected females to long - term bullying including physical attacks improved their chances of fathering babies with them			1
' males who directed aggression toward females at high rates were more likely to sire those females ' offspring than less violent males were			0
' this effect was particularly strong for high ranking males ( in the chimpanzee community ) , ' @entity16 added			0
the study involved an ape species that is a close genetic cousin of humans but the researchers were wary about making conclusions about the origins of sexual violence in people			0
the researchers knew from detailed long - term observations of this chimp community in @entity6 's @entity30 which ones had mated with one another as well as the paternity of 31 babies born during the study period from 1995 through 2011 based on dna collected from fecal matter			1
' the hypothesis is that females are intimidated by long - term aggression from the male so that they acquiesce or even solicit mating from the male when they are fertile , and avoid mating with other males in his presence for fear of further aggression from the male , ' said @entity79 evolutionary anthropologist @entity78 , one of the researchers			1
male chimps that subjected females to long - term aggressive behavior , often including physical attacks , greatly improved their chances of fathering babies with them			1
the aggressive behavior by the males included violent physical attacks including biting and striking that sometimes caused wounds as well as chasing the female and engaging in outbursts in which the male charges and strikes nearby foliage			2
@entity96 did not take place during or immediately after the bullying			0
in fact , it was serial aggressive behavior over two or three years that was particularly effective in later securing fatherhood			1
the researchers found that females at their time of peak fertility actively sought to mate with the males that bullied them			2
the researchers noted that the evolutionary lineage for humans and chimps split some 7 million years ago and that the mating systems for the two species are different			2
' nevertheless , recognizing the adaptive value of male - female aggression in chimpanzees may inevitably help us to understand , and hopefully prevent , similar behavior among humans , ' @entity16 said			0
the research was published in the scientific journal @entity123 .			0
