an employee at a veterans ' affairs hospital in @entity3 has come forward - and claimed that veterans ' records were intentionally falsified and their medical requests hidden			1
whistle - blower @entity7 , an appointment scheduler at the @entity10 , said in an exclusive interview with @entity12 she would note on records if veterans died before they could receive treatment			1
however , she said someone had changed dead veterans ' records seven times , if not more , to make it seem they were alive			1
' i would say ( it was done to ) hide the fact , ' @entity7 said			2
' because it is marked a death			0
and that death needs to be reported			0
so if you change that to , " entered in error " or , my personal favorite , " no longer necessary , " that makes the death go away			0
so the death would never be reported then			0
' as part of the interview , @entity7 said she was told to hide new patient requests in a ' secret list ' hidden inside a desk drawer			1
@entity7 also said that because of a 1,700 - person waiting list in 2013 , she was forced to determine which patients could receive treatment - while at the same time was pressured by hospital staff to schedule appointments for other ill veterans			1
pressure : @entity7 said because of a 1,700 - person waiting list in 2013 , she was forced to determine which patients could receive treatment - while at the same time was pressured by hospital staff to schedule appointments for other ill veterans ' and that really overtook even the wait list , ' @entity7 told @entity12			1
' because now i have a consult where veterans are very sick			0
so i have to ease up on the wait list			0
it sounds so wrong to say , but i tried to work these scheduled appointments so at least i felt the sickest of the sick were being treated			0
' @entity7 decided to take action after she called a veteran to take him off the wait list , but found out he had died while waiting , @entity12 reported			2
she later worked with dr. @entity67 and contacted the @entity10 's @entity68 - and when nothing came of it , @entity67 spoke to the media			2
@entity7 told @entity12 she ' submitted evidence ' to authorities .			2
