there was no @entity1 in his coaching box but by and large @entity3 looked impressively businesslike as he fought his way through to the second round of the @entity6			1
in conditions of cold air and a blustery wind that could have been plucked straight from his native @entity10 he beat world number 55 @entity13 6 - 1 6 - 4 3 - 6 6 - 3 to set up a clash with @entity16 € ™ s @entity15			1
@entity1 , not with him at a @entity18 for the first time since 2011 , would have been generally pleased with the way his ex-client handled himself against the flashy @entity22 , whose power off both flanks gives his opponents precious little rhythm			0
focused : @entity3 returns a powerful backhand on his way to victory over @entity13 making his point : @entity3 celebrates winning a valuable point during his first round match @entity33 : @entity3 executes a textbook serve on the clay at @entity6 in @entity36 on the run : @entity3 moves around the back of the court in defence during his first - round match @entity3 remained mainly focused , although he was disturbed at times by the overhead cable camera , which kept moving in his eyeline as he tried to serve			2
his start was very satisfactory and full of clean hitting but one area he will look to improve was the way her served in a topsy turvy second set , which allowed @entity13 to break him three times and threaten to get back into the match			0
overall , however , this was a decent start , and with his scheduled quarter final seed @entity55 out of the tournament there is everything to play for			0
not enough : @entity22 's @entity58 could n't deal with a rejuvenated @entity3 on tuesday afternoon determined : @entity3 shouts as he returns a shot from @entity13 in his first round tie centre of attention : fans in @entity36 watch the action as @entity3 prepares to serve during the first set support : @entity3 's girlfriend @entity67 arrives to watch her man in action frustrated figure : @entity3 reacts after one of his shots is deemed out of play			2

@entity3 won 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 3
