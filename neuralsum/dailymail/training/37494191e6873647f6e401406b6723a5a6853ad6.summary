by @entity0 @entity1 has said she would like her controversial unmade bed artwork to stay in the @entity3 - but doubts it will because nowhere can afford the £ 1million price tag			1
my bed - derided by many critics at the time - is a dishevelled monument to ' ladette ' culture , surrounded by used condoms , worn knickers , cigarette butts and vodka bottles			1
it almost won the prestigious @entity16 in 1999 , and will go under the hammer at @entity19 's auction house in @entity20 next tuesday , where it is expected to net current owner @entity22 between £ 800,000 and £ 1.2million			1
she told the @entity39 : ' i feel kind of philosophical about it			2
the @entity42 really want it but they have n’t any money			2
no one has any money to buy it			2
' earlier today she revealed how she is struck by flashbacks when she 's near the bed , the display of which she said ' changed people 's perceptions of art '			1
she said : ' this is a surreal experience			2
every time i 'm near the bed or install the bed i get flashbacks and recollections of when i first saw the bed , which was in my bedroom and that was 16 years ago			1
' when i made the bed today , i actually had to get in it and pull the duvet over me and push it back to make it feel real and look real			2
' even the smell and everything , it 's all still there for me			2
it 's very , very evocative			0
except it 's like waking up , i would n't say a nightmare , but definitely ... it 's really strange			0
pricey : @entity24 revealed that she doubts any @entity3 galleries will be prepared to pay between £ 800,000 and £ 1.2million for the piece up close : a close up of @entity1 's piece ' my bed ' which features cigarettes and used condoms ' it 's now going on a different journey			1
i just hope it goes to a nice place			0
it 's helped me a lot			0
' @entity24 said reactions to the artwork , which she produced after a traumatic relationship breakdown , varied across the globe			1
she said : ' in @entity98 they were shocked by my dirty slippers but they stole some bloody knickers and some condoms '			1
' in @entity104 it was like , " yeah , we 've seen feminist art before , we 've done it already " , no fuss , just treated it like a regular artwork			0
' of course in the @entity3 , it just exploded with the @entity16			1
i still think it 's iconic			0
there was nothing in the world in art that has ever looked like this , that has ever been like this , it 's seminal			0
' it changed people 's perceptions of what art is and what art can be			0
that 's why it 's still really special to me			0
if i could i would show this at my next exhibition			0
i still love it , i still stand by it and i made it 16 years ago			0
' @entity22 , who paid £ 150,000 for @entity25 in 2000 , is selling it to support the work of his public gallery in @entity134 .			1
