there seemed to be a medal on every uniform – be it military or school			1
three @entity5 , four @entity6 , 1,650 gallantry decorations and tens of thousands of campaign medals were awarded during @entity10 ’s 13 - year action in @entity11			1
yesterday , as the country gathered to honour that campaign at @entity15 , several children were wearing the medals of fathers who never returned from the war against the @entity19			1
in pride of place behind her were the holders of another decoration			1
the @entity36 is the medal no one wants			1
yet no decoration , surely , is worn with greater pride			1
devised by the sovereign at the height of the @entity11 conflict in 2009 , it is a silver brooch presented to the next of kin of every member of the @entity47 killed in the line of duty – and there were 453 of those in @entity11			1
yesterday , the families of every single one had been invited to join the @entity23 at @entity15 ’s			1
historians and politicians will still be debating the merits of the @entity11 project years from now			1
but the bravery and determination of those called upon to serve there has never been in question			2
hence the decision to recognise their collective efforts with a formal act of worship and a parade through the @entity69			2
entitled ‘ @entity71 ’ ( ‘ thanksgiving ’ might have been triumphal ) , this was a state occasion of the highest order			2
all the senior members of the @entity75 – including @entity11 veteran @entity76 – and all the service chiefs were present , along with the three main party leaders plus representatives of our @entity81 allies and all the main faiths			1
for dad : @entity85 , five , son of @entity87 @entity86 who was killed in @entity11 in june 2010 remembered : @entity88 ( left ) wore the medals awarded to his father ( right ) who was just 30 when he died past prime ministers @entity94 and @entity95 were also present			1
they had front row seats in the @entity97 , flanked by senior forces personnel rather than grieving families			1
in the run - up to this service some had questioned the presence of the leaders who took @entity10 into this conflict			1
there would , of course , have been louder criticism had the two men stayed away			2
even so , great delicacy was required			2
at the close , the ex-pms were out of a side door and off the premises before the royal chauffeurs had even started their engines			2
by far the largest section of the 2,600 - strong congregation – more numerous , even , than the veterans themselves – were the bereaved			2
for each holder of the @entity36 had been granted two invitations – and quite right , too			2
there were some desperately poignant sights ; a schoolboy with @entity126 ’s medals sitting alongside @entity127 , in black , with her @entity36 on her lapel and tissues clasped tightly in her hand ; a middle - aged couple blinking back tears ; a young mother , dressed in black , dashing for the door with a small , screaming boy in her arms during the opening prayers			1
it ’s rare to see a toddler at a state occasion			2
presumably , the little chap was there to honour a gallant father or uncle			1
touching moment : prince @entity147 with @entity47 families at the reception at the @entity149 after the service i hope they were both allowed back in			1
because this was a magnificent service , a finely judged blend of tradition , innovation , stirring but non-martial music and audience participation			2
among half a dozen worshippers chosen to read the prayers of intercession were a senior @entity163 officer , former corporal @entity162 , who won her @entity164 dashing through a maelstrom of gunfire to treat four wounded soldiers , and @entity168 , mother of lance corporal @entity169 of the @entity170			1
he won a posthumous @entity5 for his attack on @entity19 positions in 2012			2
‘ for peacemakers and peacekeepers who seek to keep this world secure and free , may @entity178 give peace , ’ declared mrs @entity168 faultlessly , her son ’s @entity5 pinned alongside her @entity174			2
seats were left empty at the service as family members of the 453 who died chose not to attend			1
relatives travelled to @entity185 to watch the service on a screen outside @entity15 – even though more than 40 seats were left unoccupied inside			1
@entity190 , whose son sergeant @entity191 , 25 , was killed in an explosion in 2006 , was one who declined the invitation			2
mr @entity191 , from @entity195 ’ @entity194 , said : ‘ it is more of a public relations exercise , with the good and the great at the front and all the relatives at the back			2
we do n’t need to go to a service like that to remember our son , we remember him every day			2
’ around 20 bereaved family members and veterans were either unwell or unable to travel at the last minute and did not attend the service			1
another 15 to 20 bereaved family members and veterans unexpectedly did not turn up			1
a @entity209 source said : ‘ it ’s understandable that on such an emotional day for so many people there were some who felt they could n’t attend today ’s service			0
’ after a lesson from prime minister @entity221 ( ‘ blessed are the peacemakers … ’ ) , the @entity215 shared his readings with 13 - year - old @entity217 from @entity218			0
@entity217 still remembers the day in 2007 when his father , captain @entity222 of the @entity223 , was so badly wounded he had to be evacuated back to @entity10			0
but captain @entity222 made a full recovery and went on to complete a further two tours of duty			0
it was hard to tell who was proudest of whom when i met them yesterday			0
‘ i ’m more nervous than he is , ’ captain @entity222 admitted before the service			0
in another emotionally charged moment , the @entity234 was carried the full length of the cathedral in a procession of its own			0
originally knocked together from old shell cases at @entity240 , this brass crucifix became a shrine for troops in the field			0
yesterday , before the @entity245 herself , it was formally rededicated by the archbishop of @entity248 , @entity249 @entity247			0
the archbishop based his short sermon on the words of the prophet , @entity253 : ‘ @entity254 is your faithfulness			0
’ thanking all the troops , he also lauded the vast support network behind them			0
‘ i ’m told that each wounded person was supported by up to 80 others by the time they got home			1
’ and he had stirring words for the home front			0
‘ we also thank those of you who stayed behind , who let your loved ones go ; you who worried for their safety each day , took your phone to your bedside each night			0
’ departing to @entity274 ’s @entity273 in @entity275 , the @entity23 was introduced to another cross-section of those whose lives were turned upside down by this conflict			1
corporal @entity280 of the @entity87 is now a triple amputee			0
@entity283 lost her husband , lieutenant - colonel @entity284 of the @entity285 , the most senior officer killed in the conflict			1
yesterday , she was accompanied by her daughters , @entity287 , nine , and @entity288 , seven , who presented flowers to the @entity23			1
respects : the @entity23 receives flowers from sisters @entity288 ( right ) and @entity293 ( second right ) , whose father lieutenant colonel @entity284 was the most senior officer to be killed in @entity11 in front of the cathedral , the parade was forming up			1
detachments from all the @entity299 marched the short distance to a @entity149 reception while an @entity163 flypast – including that great @entity11 warhorse , the @entity304 – flew overhead			1
thousands of onlookers , many of them @entity306 workers , had turned out to clap them all			0
i am glad to report that i neither saw nor heard a single protester , just lots of polite , heartfelt applause			0
some of the loudest was for those bringing up the rear – the families			0
for many , the last experience of something like this was the raw agony of the homecoming parade at @entity319 in @entity320			0
yesterday should leave them with a sunnier memory			0
that was beautiful and we are smiling , ’ said @entity323 of @entity324 , @entity325 , beneath a glorious lime green hat			0
she was here to remember her beloved brother , corporal @entity331 , and to support her mother @entity332			0
parents - to - be : prince @entity334 and the @entity335 also attended the moving service at @entity149 i met @entity338 and her daughter @entity339 , 27			1
her @entity36 pinned proudly to her coat , @entity338 had bumped into some old comrades of her son , corporal @entity342 of the @entity343 , who died on easter sunday 2012			0
‘ i can not fault anything about today			0
it ’s been wonderful , ’ she said			0
‘ coming here , you realise you ’re not on your own			0
you ’re part of an enormous family			0
’ it may be a family that has known great pain			0
but yesterday will undoubtedly have left it stronger			0
as @entity357 nods off ... his two predecessors sneak out the back door @entity94 and @entity95 attended the service but left out of a back entrance of @entity15 ’s to avoid coming face to face with the families of those who died in @entity11			1
mr @entity94 , the prime minister who took @entity10 to war , and his successor left several minutes before the other guests , escorted by bodyguards to separate @entity369 saloons			0
relatives had reacted with fury last week when told mr @entity94 and mr @entity95 would be among the congregation , with one saying mr @entity94 has ‘ got blood on his hands ’			0
a spokesman for mr @entity94 said he had to leave quickly to fly to an economic conference in @entity378			0
out of line : @entity380 seems to duck down as he stands with prime minister @entity221 and @entity382 feeling tired ? mr @entity380 rubs his eyes , cups his head in his hand and then appears to drop off quick exit : former prime ministers @entity95 ( left ) and @entity94 at friday 's commemoration			1

@entity391 gathered to honour @entity11 campaign at @entity15
@entity23 led the nation 's tribute , supported by her husband , prince @entity22
all the senior members of the @entity75 and political leaders attended
several children were wearing medals of fathers who never returned
