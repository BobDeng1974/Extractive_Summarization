women may claim they are attracted to a man for his personality , looks or even his money , but the naked truth is far simpler and cruder that that : size matters			1
new research has shown that 21st century females are far more similar to their cavewomen ancestors than originally thought , because the size of a man 's penis still plays a key role in deciding how attractive a woman rates him			1
the findings are based on 5,145 computer - generated images of men shown to over 100 adult women of all ages and backgrounds , @entity21 is better : women might not admit it but they prefer well - endowed men each image showed a representation of the male form , with varying combinations of height , shoulder - to - body ratio and , of course , penis length			0
flaccid penis sizes of between two and five inches ( five to 13cm ) were used because this is the typical size range found in @entity36 men , according to the study carried out by researchers at the @entity39 , @entity40			1
women were then asked to rate the attractiveness of each man , according to the research published in the journal @entity46 ( @entity46 )			0
the results showed that while women 's opinions were influenced by a variety of physical features - tall and broad - shouldered men tended to be favoured over shorter men with bigger waistlines - the size of a man 's penis reigned supreme in the attractiveness stakes			1
the findings contradict previous studies suggesting that the size of male genitalia was of no importance to women			0
while researchers were unable to find the perfect penis size , proportion is crucial , they say			2
in what may come as a relief to many men , manhood must not be so large that it appears out of proportion to the rest of his body			0
the long and short of it : women shown a variety of computer - generated men said penis size was the most important trait they said : ' our results directly contradict claims that penis size is unimportant to most females			2
they show that female mate choice could have played a role in the evolution of the relatively large human male penis			0
' ' males with a larger penis were rated as being relatively more attractive , but , the proportional increase [ in size ] begins to decrease [ in attractiveness ] after a certain size , ' said the report			2
the @entity40 study comes after another investigation carried out by the @entity99 found that a larger than average penis is more likely to bring women to orgasm			1
in the @entity105 study , an average length penis was defined as being 5.8 inches ( 14.7 cm ) long when erect - the same length as a ten pound note .			0

size of a man 's penis still plays key role in deciding how attractive a woman finds him , say @entity40 *experts*
*modern* women are more like their cavewomen ancestors than previously thought
but if size is out of proportion , women are put off
