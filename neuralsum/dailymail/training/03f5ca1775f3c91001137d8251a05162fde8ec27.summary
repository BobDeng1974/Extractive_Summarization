@entity0 has accused @entity1 and @entity2 of striking a secret deal to prevent the @entity4 publishing key documents about the @entity7 war			1
the former foreign secretary said extracts of letters between mr @entity1 and president @entity11 have been held back to save the ex-prime minister ’s reputation			1
it is believed the documents may shed light on the allegation that mr @entity1 had already agreed to go to war up to a year before the 2003 invasion			1
accusations : @entity0 has accused @entity1 and @entity2 of striking a secret deal to prevent the @entity4 publishing key documents about the @entity7 war			1
in a speech , @entity0 made the astonishing claim that mr @entity2 had backed mr @entity1 ’s decision to block the publication of the letters in return for his ‘ neutrality or tacit support ’ at the next general election			1
the peer also pointed the finger of blame at cabinet secretary sir @entity33 , accusing him too of blocking the publication of the documents			2
the @entity4 into the @entity7 conflict was set up four years ago but has yet to report			2
while sir @entity37 and his panel have been given access to all the documents , they have been denied the right to publish some of those which they regard as key to their conclusions			0
in a speech at the ' how the light gets in ' literary festival in @entity51 last week , @entity0 said : ‘ it is almost beyond belief that the inquiry is being prevented from revealing extracts that they believe relevant from exchanges between president @entity11 and prime minister @entity1			1
‘ by whom is the inquiry being prevented from printing those extracts ? we are told by the cabinet secretary			2
that is like a rerun of @entity65			0
‘ publication of the @entity11 extracts would not be blocked if @entity1 had not objected , nor if that objection had not been supported by the present prime minister , @entity2			1
claims : former foreign secretary @entity0 , pictured , said extracts of letters between mr @entity1 and president @entity11 have been held back to save the ex-prime minister 's reputation ‘ both men are hiding behind conventions that are totally inappropriate given the nature of the inquiry			1
’ he then levelled an extraordinary charge – denied by both the @entity1 and @entity2 camps – that the two leaders had struck a private deal			2
@entity0 said : ‘ no 10 reveals that they are in constant contact on many issues with @entity1 and @entity1 ’s own people confirm this			1
not for nothing does @entity2 see himself still as the “ heir to @entity1 ”			2
‘ it is hard to escape the conclusion that no 10 hopes to … win the neutrality or possibly tacit support of @entity1 by the general election			2
’ @entity0 pointed out that elements of mr @entity1 ’s communications with mr @entity11 have already been revealed by the former prime minister ‘ and his close associates ’ in their memoirs , which were also approved by past @entity101			1
sir @entity33 ’s predecessor , sir @entity102 , has informed the inquiry that it can not publish the @entity106 letters because they represented ‘ particularly privileged channels of communication ’ , the exposure of which would ‘ prejudice the @entity111 ’s relations with the @entity112 ’			2
but @entity0 said that was not acceptable : ‘ the conventions and @entity115 covering such conversations were never intended to be used to block a major inquiry held into a political and military fiasco of a dimension we have not seen since the @entity121 in the @entity122			1
’ @entity0 , who has written a book accusing mr @entity1 of ‘ hubristic lying ’ over his role in the war , said : ‘ clarifying whether @entity127 was lied to will be a test of nerve for the @entity130			1
‘ it will not be sufficient to duck out and let its readers determine who , if anyone , lied			0
‘ we all recognise there are different types of lies			0
white lies , grey lies , sexual lies , necessary lies			0
‘ yet there are black lies , lies that debauch the standards of public life and they must be treated with the utmost seriousness			0
many believe politics is the art of lying			0
if lies are allowed to become the currency of political debate on the floor of the @entity157 then our democracy is gravely endangered			0
’ attack : a petrol bomb hits a @entity111 soldier in @entity161 in 2005			0
the soldier survived both mr @entity1 ’s office and @entity163 vociferously denied that they had struck any kind of deal over the documents			1
a spokesman for mr @entity1 said : ‘ this is categorically untrue and completely absurd			1
the inquiry has had unprecedented access to all relevant government papers throughout , including these ones			0
’ a @entity163 spokesman called the claims of collusion ‘ total nonsense ’			0
‘ the idea of any kind of deal is categorically untrue , ’ he added			0
but the @entity180 admitted that while all the documents had been shown to the inquiry team , permission to publish letters between mr @entity1 and mr @entity11 had been rejected			1
a @entity180 spokesman said : ‘ any suggestion that the government is attempting to influence the work of the inquiry is wrong			0
‘ at the outset the government assured the inquiry of its full cooperation			0
it continues to fully support the inquiry			0
’ a senior source said sir @entity37 had ‘ yet to begin ’ a dialogue with the @entity180 about some unresolved issues , including the @entity200 notes .			0

@entity0 said extracts of letters between mr @entity1 and president @entity11 have been held back
