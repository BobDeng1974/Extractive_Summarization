‘ @entity8 was also made to walk five or six metres to a first aid room - despite holding her abdomen when teachers found her on the ground			1
‘ we need to know if that caused more serious damage			2
there are a lot of questions that need answering			2
’ the family claim that staff at @entity64 in @entity18 never apologised nor accepted responsibility			1
