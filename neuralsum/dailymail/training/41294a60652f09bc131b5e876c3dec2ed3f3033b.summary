a grandmother , who has been left devastated by the discovery of two abandoned babies in one week , has set up a ' safe haven ' on her own doorstep			1
@entity5 from @entity6 , south west of @entity7 , has also set up a @entity9 page in which she offers to pick up any unwanted children from mothers who prefer to remain anonymous			1
' i just want to offer another alternative to mothers than leaving their babies in a drain or burying it at the beach , ' mrs @entity5 told @entity18			2
' if you 're in distress or do n't know what to do or you 're scared or alone or worried for whatever reason – if you just have no other means of caring for your infant - contact me , ' she said			2
' that 's just one way that i 'm prepared to help people in this situation			2
if someone said that they lived in @entity51 , i 'd be prepared to go down there and meet them somewhere or they can leave the baby somewhere and i 'll get it if they want to remain anonymous			0
' they can also leave their baby out the front and ring the doorbell and i 'll leave it for ten seconds before i answer if they do n't want to have a face to face meeting			0
' the 54 - year - old mother - of - four , who works as a midwife , has also set up a bassinet at her front door ' i 'll leave it for ten seconds before i answer [ the door ] if they do n't want to have a face to face meeting , ' she told @entity18 her offer comes following the discovery of a baby 's body buried in the sand at @entity31 and a newborn boy who was , only a week earlier , found abandoned in drain at @entity79			1
mrs @entity5 , who called police in 2009 to offer to pay for the funeral of a baby whose body had been found at a rubbish tip , said she has received an enormous amount of positive support for her offer , but is yet to be contacted by any mothers			1
when that day comes , she said she would immediately take the infant to a hospital and contact the @entity90 and police , but promised to maintain the mother 's privacy			1
the registered nurse said that she would like to see the introduction of baby hatches , adding that she had met many mothers during her career as a midwife who were not aware of the services available to them			0
' if you 're in distress or do n't know what to do or you 're scared or alone or worried for whatever reason – if you just have no other means of caring for your infant - contact me , ' mrs @entity5 said after sharing her mobile phone number on her @entity9 page she has received an enormous amount of positive support for her offer , but is yet to be contacted by any mothers			1
when that day comes , she said she would immediately take the infant to a hospital and contact the @entity90 and police , but promised to maintain the mother 's privacy ' i understand there are reasons women are pushed to conceal their pregnancies , and there are a lot of women who suffer from depression , ' mrs @entity5 said			1
' they fear what you are going to do about it			0
for instance , when i was working in @entity129 with @entity130 , when you 'd mention @entity131 they would automatically think that you 're going to take the baby straight away			0
' people do n't know what services are out there , @entity130 can help you with housing for example			0
' ' i do n't understand why we as a society are n't outraged by the discovery of babies being buried in the sand			2
' ' if the government is n't doing anything , i will			0
