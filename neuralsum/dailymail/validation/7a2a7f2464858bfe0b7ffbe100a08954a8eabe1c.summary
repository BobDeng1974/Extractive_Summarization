upon discovering she was n't breathing , the couple 's five - year - old pet @entity9 , @entity12 , began barking			1
this woke mr @entity8 , who hurriedly dialled 999 and performed cpr on his girlfriend until paramedics arrived			1

she was able to make a full recovery after her cardiac arrest , something paramedics said is unheard of incredibly , doctors said miss @entity6 's heart had stopped for 30 minutes before mr @entity8 managed to resuscitate her			1
miss @entity6 , who lives with her boyfriend in @entity35 , @entity36 , has since been diagnosed with @entity37 ( @entity37 ) syndrome			2

miraculously , she has now made a full recovery			0
she said : ' i owe my life to my dog and my boyfriend			2
if @entity12 had n't woken @entity22 up i might not be here today			0
' i remember going to bed and drifting off the sleep and the next i know i 'm in intensive care in hospital and told i 'd suffered a heart attack			2
' the doctors say i was technically dead because it took @entity22 30 minutes to get my heart started			1
' @entity22 said he woke up with @entity12 barking and jumping up at my side of the bed and going mad			2
' he says he could tell something was wrong with me and dialled 999 and the operator talked him through cpr			1
' at first the doctors said i might be at risk of brain damage and i could n't feel my legs and one of my hands was all limp but i 've now made a full recovery			0
' miss @entity6 now says she ' owes her life ' to her labrador @entity12 and her boyfriend @entity8 , 27 miss @entity6 's @entity37 ( @entity37 ) syndrome had meant her heart began beating irregularly			1
this caused a cardiac arrest , where the electrical activity of the heart becomes so chaotic that the heart stops pumping and quivers of ' fibrillates ' instead			1

mr @entity8 said he woke up to barking on january 2nd this year			0
he said : ' i was half asleep when @entity12 woke me up			2
' i heard @entity6 's breathing becoming erratic and i tried to wake her and tapped each side of her face , but she was unconscious so i called 999			2
' my first thought was that i did n't want to waste the paramedics ' time but when i was on the phone her breathing went from in and out to every few seconds			0
' i tried not to panic and to stay focused			0
i kept thinking that the only chance she has relies on me doing the cpr properly			0
' rescue crews from @entity96 dashed to the scene in under 15 minutes before rushing her to the @entity99 in @entity100			0
paramedic @entity101 said : ' i 've been on the job for 14 years and i 've never seen anything like it			0
' when people suffer cardiac arrests , quite often they are left with neurological problems			0
they do n't usually make a 100 per cent recovery			0
