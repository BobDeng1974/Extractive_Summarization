by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:33 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 06:25 est , 12 august 2013 criminals used a giant catapult to fire contraband over a prison wall to inmates inside			1
the gang attached a huge elastic sling to an eight foot tall metal frame with the intention of shooting packages of drugs and mobile phones into the jail			1
but they were caught by prison officers who spotted them acting suspiciously in a wood near the perimeter fence			2
the catapult alert was sounded at an unnamed prison in the @entity21 , but the gang was caught when officers went to investigate , the men fled , leaving the giant catapult behind			1
one parcel had made it over the fence but was seized inside the jail			0
three others , containing drugs , mobile phones and other banned goods were found near the catapult			2
@entity35 security officers at other jails have now been warned that criminals may use similar tactics elsewhere			1
the catapult alert was sounded at an unnamed prison in the @entity21			1
prison officers believe the criminals first used potatoes to test fire the weapon			1
they adjusted the trajectory and distance to try to land in a target area inside the jail			0
the gang intended to throw packages of drugs and mobile phones to their inmates using an 8ft metal frame with an elastic sling attached ( here 's the @entity58 925 ) - and even tried hurling potatoes over the walls to test their weapon one man held the catapult , while the other pulled the huge elastic band back			1
it was identified as a ‘ @entity70 ’ catapult designed for use with water balloons and sold online			1
the third man acted as a spotter and was on the phone to the intended recipients inside the jail			0
they would pass on directions to adjust the strength and angle of the weapon depending on the results of the test firings			0
a prison source said : ‘ apparently , the three suspects started their operation by firing potatoes into the prison , in order to calculate trajectory and distance			2
‘ one suspect held the base of the catapult and one was firing the objects			2
a third suspect was directing operations using a mobile which he used to liaise with a prisoner inside the jail			0
’ the source added : ‘ the discovery by the alert officers at the jail prevented a significant supply chain of drugs , mobile phones and other contraband from criminals outside to the prison			1
’ police have been called in and are investigating the incident			0
insiders said the find suggested an organised supply network at work with ‘ resources , planning and determination ’ officials said they had disrupted a ‘ significant contraband supply chain from the criminal community to the prison ’			1
prison staff have struggled to disrupt the supply of drugs into @entity128 ’s prisons			1
often packages are simply tossed over the wall into an area frequented by inmates			0
lags use illicit mobile phones to arrange the drop so they are there at the right time			0
prison chiefs have tried to block mobile phone signals around jails but have struggled to get the technology to work			2
inmates have been known to hide drugs and even mobile phones inside their body to try and get them in to jail			0
several prisons are fitted with x-ray chairs to spot hidden goods			0
in other cases , corrupt prison officers are used to smuggle the goods inside			0
it is estimated the trade in drugs inside prisons could be worth £ 100million a year			0
some inmates have complained it is easier to get drugs in jail than outside , and said they did not develop a habit until they were locked up			0
ministers have launched ‘ drug free wings ’ in an effort to crack down on supply and allow inmates to get clean			1
a @entity169 spokesman said : ‘ this demonstrates the significant lengths criminals will go to in order to smuggle contraband into our prisons , and demonstrates the excellent work carried out by vigilant staff to foil this attempt			1
‘ this is indicative of the way in which we are succeeding in tackling the problem of illicit items being smuggled into prisons			0
’ anyone caught trying to get drugs or mobile phones into prisons may find themselves behind bars if convicted			2
