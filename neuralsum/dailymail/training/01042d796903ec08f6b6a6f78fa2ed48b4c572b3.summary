rumours are already hinting at the fact @entity3 ’s next handset , dubbed @entity4 6 , will have a full @entity5 and now new reports suggest this display could be made of sapphire glass			1
these claims have been made because @entity3 recently announced plans to open a mineral plant in @entity12 with sapphire glass experts @entity13			1
the facility is expected to employ around 700 people to manufacture sapphire crystal and sapphire glass , and this technology could make its way onto the screens of the next @entity4			1
@entity3 has been heavily criticised in the past for its fragile devices			0
rumours in november claimed @entity3 's @entity4 6 , artist 's impression pictured , would have a screen made from sapphire glass			1
the technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin , hard - wearing and scratch resistant synthetic sapphire is a hard , transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide , produced at high temperatures			0
as the material is heated , it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond - coated saws			0
these round disks are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			0
the technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin , super-strong and scratch resistant			0
@entity3 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity49 fingerprint scanner on its latest @entity50 and to protects the phone 's camera			1
as a result , sapphire glass could potentially replace @entity55 currently used in most high - end smartphones			2

@entity3 additionally protects the camera on the @entity4 with a small piece of this super-strong material			2

reports @entity3 was experimenting with sapphire displays began last year , yet sources claimed at the time @entity3 found the technology ‘ infeasible			1
’ this was because sapphire glass is more expensive to produce than normal screens			0
the plans to build the plant could equally be less about creating sapphire screens , and more about mass producing the firm 's @entity49 technology			2
@entity3 recently announced plans to open a mineral plant that uses sapphire - based materials			1
@entity3 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity49 fingerprint scanner on its @entity50 , pictured , and to protect the cameras on its latest models			1
rumours now claim @entity3 could use the plant to make strong sapphire glass screens it ’s likely any future models of the @entity4 and @entity106 will feature the biometric technology introduced on the @entity50 and @entity3 will need a plant to be able to produce a lot of the material , quickly			1
in a statement about the announcement , @entity13 said : ‘ although the agreement does not guarantee volumes , it does require @entity115 to maintain a minimum level of capacity			0
’ while an @entity3 spokesman added : we are proud to expand our domestic manufacturing initiative with a new facility in @entity12 , creating more than 2,000 jobs in engineering , manufacturing and construction			0
‘ this new plant will make components for @entity3 products and it will run on 100 per cent renewable energy from day one , as a result of the work we are doing with @entity132 to create green energy sources to power the facility			2

@entity3 has announced plans to open a mineral plant in @entity12
it has *partnered* with sapphire glass experts @entity13
around 700 people could be employed to make the mineral technology
it could be used to create sapphire displays in future models of @entity4
the technology is already used in the @entity49 scanner of the @entity50
