for those living in @entity2 - or planning a camping trip during extreme weather conditions - some good news may be on the horizon			1
a @entity7 - based inventor has just come up with a relatively inexpensive way to stay safe during a twister : an over sized sleeping bag made from the same material as bulletproof vests			1
the @entity13 is extremely versatile and can be stored anywhere , weighing only 12 pounds when all rolled up			2
while the sleeping bag wo n't protect you from injuries from larger materials ( like broken bones ) , it can resist being punctured by flying debris up to 200 miles per hour , which can be just as dangerous			1
cuts and lacerations make up over 90 per cent of injuries caused by tornadoes			0
lightweight : the shield is versatile and can be stored anywhere , weighing only 12 pounds when rolled up the sleeping bag expands to the size of a queen - sized bed in less than a minute and is large enough to accommodate two adults and a child protection from flying debris comes from layers of padding and ballistic nylon protection comes from layers of padding and ballistic nylon , and the bag 's bottom layer is made of ripstop nylon so you can breathe while you ’re inside			1
the inventor , @entity56 , came up with the idea in 2011 , after two massive tornadoes ripped through his home town of @entity60 in the @entity61			1
' our family did n't have any protection , we did n't have a safe room to go to			0
so after that tornado , i started looking for options to protect my family			0
my wife and our four - year - old son			2
' ' but there were n't any options that were less than $ 4,000 , so i started developing a product that would bridge that gap between nothing and $ 4,000			0
' at just £ 247 - or £ 197 for early adopters - it 's a much more affordable option than safe rooms or storm cellars			2
the @entity81 campaign is looking to raise £ 65,000 to put the @entity13 into production			0
currently , developers have raised just over £ 1870 of their goal .			0
