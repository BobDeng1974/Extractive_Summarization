by @entity0 published : 11:25 est , 3 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:40 est , 4 december 2013 we tend to think of @entity4 as brutish and messy cavemen who lumbered from one meal to the next			2
but it turns out we may have been doing our distant cousins a disservice			0
new evidence suggests that @entity4 , who vanished around 30,000 years ago , lived in organised and tidy spaces - much in the same way as modern humans			0
a collapsed rock shelter in north - west @entity16 revealed that cavemen were tidy			1
the site ( pictured ) showed how they arranged their living space , assigning separate areas for preparing food , making tools and socialising , according to a study which was published in december archaeologists have discovered an ancient cave shelter which shows they thoughtfully arranged their living space , assigning separate areas for preparing food , making tools and socialising			1
dr @entity30 - @entity29 , from the @entity31 , who led the research , said : ' there has been this idea that @entity4 did not have an organised use of space , something that has always been attributed to humans			0
' but we found that @entity4 did not just throw their stuff everywhere but in fact were organised and purposeful when it came to domestic space			2
' neanderthals were similar to early modern humans but belonged to a separate human sub-species			0
the friends and family of the @entity4 went to great care to dig a grave and protect his body the two tribes co-existed for thousands of years in @entity53 before @entity4 vanished around 30,000 years ago , probably because they could not compete with the modern humans			0
the new findings , published in the @entity55 , detail the result of excavations at @entity58 , a collapsed rock shelter in north - west @entity16			1
investigation of three @entity4 levels at the cave site showed how areas were divided up for different activities			0
the top level , containing animal remains , seems to have been reserved for butchering animals			1
archaeologists from the @entity31 found the cave as a result of excavations at @entity58 , a collapsed rock shelter in north - west @entity16 the middle level was a long - term sleeping area , and the bottom level a place for shorter stays			1
in the middle level , containing the most traces of human occupation , artefacts were distributed to avoid clutter around the hearth at the back of the cave			1
animal bones and stone tools were concentrated at the front rather than the rear of the shelter			1
more stone tools were found immediately inside the mouth of the cave 's bottom level , suggesting that tool production took place there to take advantage of available sunlight			1
dr @entity29 said : ' when you make stone tools there is a lot of debris that you do n't want in high - traffic areas or you risk injuring yourself			2
' there are clearly fewer stone artefacts in the back of the shelter near the hearth			2
' the finds add to growing evidence that @entity4 were more advanced than previously thought			0
dr @entity29 added : ' this is still more evidence that they were more sophisticated than many have given them credit for			0
if we are going to identify modern human behaviour on the basis of organised spatial patterns , then you have to extend it to @entity4 as well			0

@entity123 was found after excavations at the @entity58 shelter in @entity16
*upstairs* seemed to have been reserved by cavemen for butchering animals
middle level was for sleeping , and bottom level a place for shorter stays
animal bones and tools were concentrated at the front of the shelter
