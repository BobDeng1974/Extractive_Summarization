the electronic @entity8 has been belting out a decreasingly accurate @entity9 since it was won on a raffle in a pub. but its owner @entity1 , 32 , appears to be the only one pleased by this fact , as his parents have repeatedly tried to hide the eight - inch figure from him			1
mr @entity1 , from @entity17 , @entity18 , was given the mini @entity2 when he was two by his father @entity19 who won it in a pub raffle			2
and amazingly @entity1 's never had to change the batteries , even though the current two 1980s 'd ' @entity24 have rusted solid into position			1
@entity1 , 32 , who lives with @entity26 and their 15 - month - old daughter @entity27 in @entity17 , @entity18 , is bringing out the decoration this year as he has for the past 29			2
he said : ' my mum and my partner hate it , when i was a kid mum used to hide it in the cooker or the fridge			2
' my partner says it 's got fleas			0
' it moved out of home with me about seven years ago and it 's usually in a box in the garage , i get it out about a week before @entity2			0
' it 's incredible to think he 's still going after 30 years			0
my dad @entity19 won him in a raffle at a pub and i 've had him ever since			0
' @entity8 has n't got a nickname or anything like that and the tune he plays now is a bit difficult to understand , but in battery years he must be an oap by now			0
' @entity1 's never had to change the batteries , even though the current two 1980s 'd ' @entity24 have rusted solid into position @entity1 when he was 6 years old with the @entity2 decoration in the background to the right			1

1980s 'd ' @entity24 batteries have rusted solid
