by @entity0 , education correspondent published : 19:05 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 19:05 est , 24 january 2013 one in four schools and colleges fail to secure good grades for any of their pupils at academic a-levels			2
for the first time , schools are being ranked according to how many sixth - formers achieve @entity11 grades at subjects preferred by leading universities			1
the list includes maths , @entity17 literature , physics , biology , chemistry , geography , history and languages			0
@entity24 in @entity25 was joint top of the league table for the number of students who achieved the preferred university entry grades @entity11 but tables published yesterday show that 600 sixth - forms had no pupils at the required level			1
nationally , 6.5 per cent of students achieved the @entity11 benchmark			2
private schools fared significantly better , prompting warnings that a new educational divide was ruling poorer pupils out of the race for sought - after university places			1
@entity44 in @entity45 and @entity24 in @entity25 – both fee - paying – topped the 2012 table in having 70 per cent of pupils at @entity11 level			1
private schools took 150 places in the top 200 , the remaining 50 largely being grammars			1
@entity52 , a @entity53 member of the @entity54 , said league table measures which highlighted performance in traditional subjects ‘ shone a torch ’ on under - performance			1
warning : @entity53 mp @entity52 , who sits on the @entity60 , said the tables demonstrated an ' educational divide ' between the achievements of poorer and better off students ‘ they will force schools to move into the 21st century and wake up to the fact that universities will require these rigorous qualifications , ’ he said			1
‘ these results clearly show an educational apartheid , effectively an educational @entity72 , between some of the most affluent schools in the country and the most disadvantaged			2
‘ we must raise standards in the poorest areas			0
it would be wrong to level down our universities , which are some of the most respected in the world			0
‘ every pupil , regardless of their background , must be encouraged to study the subjects that matter			0
‘ too many pupils are not being put in a position of being allowed to take these subjects in the first place			0
’ the @entity90 – the university alliance that devised the @entity11 benchmark – advises sixth - formers to pick at least two key subjects to keep their course options open			1
@entity95 , director general of the group , said : ‘ a-level choices really matter			0
too few students realise that some subjects and subject combinations can keep open wider degree course options at leading universities			0
’ the number of schools facing intervention over poor results has doubled to 215 after targets were raised			0
separate figures revealed that the drift away from core academic subjects begins much earlier than sixth form in many state schools			2
of 176,538 high - achieving pupils at primary school , more than half were not entered for gcses in five basic subject areas			2
instead they were steered toward subjects seen as less rigorous such as dance and media studies .			0

schools ranked nationally by how many get @entity11 university requirement
600 sixth - form schools and college had no pupils which met the benchmark
private schools made up 150 of top 200 places
