by @entity0 given how careful reporters have to be covering @entity3 , it was an unfortunate slip - up			1
@entity5 host @entity4 interviewed @entity7 's ambassador to the @entity8 about the crisis , then immediately called her show ' @entity10 ' by mistake			1
the @entity13 host corrected herself instantly , but it was too late as the flub gained traction with journalists and @entity20 users			1
' the host then cut to talking about a skin cancer crisis before saying : ' keep it right here on @entity10			1
@entity43 ! ' @entity20 's reaction was predictably amused			0
some users called her performance a ' train wreck ' , some simply put : ' seriously ? ' and one user called the experienced 47 - year - old presenter a ' nitwit '			0
unamused : sadly , the cameras did not capture the reaction of @entity7 's ambassador to the @entity8 experienced : the broadcaster , who has spent more than 25 years in tv journalism , was ribbed on twitter most internet users accepted the likelihood that it was an innocent mistake in a difficult job			2
but some still pointed to her father 's past as democrat @entity65 's national security advisor and suggested there could be something more sinister at work			0
@entity69 wrote : ' her dad was a powerful @entity65 so she 's safe in the ( wink - wink ) " no bias " mainstream media			0
' @entity4 , who was born and lives in @entity75 , forged her career in @entity77 and @entity78 before joining @entity5 seven years ago .			2

@entity4 had *quizzed* ambassador to @entity8 @entity23 on @entity3 crisis
but host slipped up when *popular* show @entity13 went to *commercial*
she called the show ' @entity10 ' before immediately correcting herself
