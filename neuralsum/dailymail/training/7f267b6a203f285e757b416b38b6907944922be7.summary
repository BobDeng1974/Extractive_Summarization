by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it was a penalty , there is no conspiracy theory and @entity5 is finally being seen for what he is ; an excellent coach who is a graceless and immature man who needs to learn how to lose			1
in football there are some things which are indisputable , some fouls which stand out as obvious and red cards which nobody can deny – @entity15 ' assault on @entity16 in this game being a case in point			1
however there are a lot of incidents which fall into the ‘ grey area ’ category and no matter how much they are debated agreement can not be found			0
@entity28 ’s penalty was just such an incident			2
the striker ’s foot came down on @entity31 ’s outstretched leg which caused him to lose balance and go to ground			0
in such circumstances and with the game close to ending i used to try and err on the side of caution and only award stone - wall penalty kicks			0
however if an assistant flags and indicates a penalty then you support him			0
@entity38 followed that protocol after his assistant , @entity58 , did exactly that			0
slap : @entity35 midfielder @entity15 could face disciplinary action after slapping @entity16 in the face unpunished : @entity38 was just a few feet away but his attention appeared to be elsewhere making a case : @entity16 speaks to referee @entity38 about the incident the more times i look at the replay the harder i find it to state unequivocally what the correct decision should be			1
at the end of the game @entity5 thought he was being ‘ clever ’ by complimenting @entity38 and then his boss , @entity73			2
all listening knew what he meant by the comments but the @entity77 will struggle to charge on ‘ interpretation ’ of words and rising above such puerile antics is the best way to deal with them			0
@entity5 must now contemplate the rest of the domestic season without the rash @entity15 as it is clear from replays that despite his position @entity38 was looking away as the @entity89 struck his opponent			1
as for @entity91 the @entity77 must act very strongly and show that such disgraceful behaviour is completely unacceptable			2
down in the dumps : @entity5 reiterated his thoughts in his post-match press conference off you go : @entity5 ( right ) holds back his assistant coach @entity91 after he was sent off by @entity38 ( left ) anger : @entity35 's assistant coach was infuriated by @entity38 's decision to give @entity28 a penalty			1

@entity38 was correct to award @entity28 penalty
@entity15 will be punished for ' assault ' on @entity16
@entity5 must learn to take *defeat* and stop blaming officials
@entity77 must take action against @entity35 assistant coach @entity91
