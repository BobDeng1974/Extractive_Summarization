in a world where online shopping is king , @entity0 hopes technology can change the in store experience - with a robo - assistant			1
the firm 's humanoid robot is set to start work at the information desk of a department store in @entity12 to help customers find their way around			1
the female - looking robot , named @entity16 , will only speak @entity17 - but she is also capable of sign language			1
@entity16 in the work outfit created for the robot however , @entity16 is unlikely to engage in smalltalk its makers admit			1
instead the robot was created to appear , talk and move as humanly as possible			1
@entity16 blinks , bows and moves its mouth and lips smoothly while speaking			1
a @entity0 spokesman told the @entity32 that @entity16 is programmed with multiple human - like expressions , and that it will offer six - minute guidance to customers with information about the department store including events			1
@entity16 has appeared at exhibitions and events , but this is the first time it will provide customer service			1
the robot ’s appearance was n’t modeled on any specific person but was designed to give a friendly impression , according to @entity0			2
the robot will be set up at the @entity51 department store in @entity52 , @entity12 , on monday and tuesday			1
ms @entity16 uses sign language to introduce itself to humans			1
@entity0 describes the eerie android , which has blinking eyes and a fixed smile , as having the appearance of ' a friendly young woman			2
' at present , the android can mimic only simple movements , such as exchanging greetings and signing in @entity17			1
the technology was first shown off at @entity63 in @entity64			0
one of the most popular devices there was @entity68 's dinosaur robot , the @entity69 , which lets users experience a close encounter with a 6ft 11 ( 2.1 metre - tall ) reptile droid			1
a smartphone application makes the dinosaur walk or jump , while a shake of the smartphone prompts the @entity69 to bark			0
@entity78 can also play trivia games as users answer questions through the app. another highlight is @entity85 's three - legged robot , which is capable of playing a relaxed game of ping pong			1
it watches its human opponent to predict the ball 's path , and can even decide to take it easy on opponents by missing a few hits			0
the robot ’s appearance was n’t modeled on any specific person but was designed to give a friendly impression , according to @entity0			0
with five motors to control paddle movement , it is programmed to serve the ball in a way that makes it easy for the player to return			0
' this ping pong robot is really a demonstration of how a robot can interact with a person and react in an appropriate manner , ' said @entity111 , an @entity85 manager			0
' we envision this robot perhaps being used in a factory or production line and having a role in which it would have to interact with a worker to do or build something			0
' this would involve the robot understanding the needs of its human counterpart and behaving appropriately			0

the goal is to design a companion for the elderly and people with dementia , to offer telecounselling in natural speech , communicate through sign language , and allow healthcare to keep an eye on elderly people			1
weebles may seem like basic toys now , but in their day they used an impressive weight system based on the laws of physics to ‘ wobble but never fall down			0
’ to bring this childhood toy into the modern - day , a @entity17 firm has created a troop of @entity163 - style robotic cheerleaders who dance and move while balancing on a ball			1
and thanks to built - in gyroscopes and infrared sensors , the robots perform in perfect synchronicity - but never fall over			1
the @entity171 were built by @entity172			0
instead of wheels , the cheerleading robots balance on a removable ball , which rolls in its housing to help the machines dance and move			2
they remain upright due to three advanced gyro sensors , which incorporate inverted - pendulum control technology , to detect tilt angles			2
similar gyro sensors are commonly used in digital cameras , car navigation systems , and more recently , the electronic stability control ( @entity187 ) systems that prevent cars from skidding			0
each robot is equipped with four infrared sensors , and five ultrasonic microphones to detect surrounding objects , even in the dark			0
and , based on the differing speeds of sound and light waves , this system determines the relative positions of the robots within a 172 square feet ( 16 metre square ) space			0
meanwhile a group of 14 - inch ( 36cm ) tall cheerleader robots showcased their flawless choreography			2
@entity205 manufacturing , an electronic component manufacturer , presented the cheerleaders with colour - changing pom - poms that use gyroscopic sensors to roll on spherical bases in unison without losing their balance			2
' these robots use our proprietary balancing technology combined with technology that prevents , in real time , the robots from clashing together , ' said @entity220 , a @entity205 engineer			0
a group of 14 - inch ( 36cm ) tall cheerleader robots showcased their flawless @entity223 manufacturing , an electronic component manufacturer , presented the cheerleaders with colour - changing pom - poms that use gyroscopic sensors to roll on spherical bases in unison without losing their balance ' it also uses technology that coordinates the movement of all the robots together in a synchronised manner			2

over 500 companies and organisations are exhibiting at @entity64 , which will be held until october 11 in @entity263 , east of @entity12			0
a model displays @entity17 mobile communication giant @entity266 's mobile navigation device ' @entity267 ' ( @entity268 ) which uses tactile sensations to guide the user at the ceatec electronics trade show			1

@entity16 will only speak @entity17 - but is capable of sign language
created to appear , talk and move as humanly as possible
will offer guidance to customers with information about store
