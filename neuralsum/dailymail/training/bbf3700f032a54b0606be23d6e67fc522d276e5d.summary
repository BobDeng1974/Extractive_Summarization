the @entity19 also revealed that wage growth is outpacing inflation at the fastest rate in almost five years – leaving people with more money in their pockets			1
the jobs and wages figures came amid a flurry of good economic news : in an attempt to pour cold water on the positive statistics , @entity30 claimed too many of the jobs were low paid and pointed to a small rise in youth unemployment			1
but speaking to workers at a @entity40 plant in @entity41 , mr @entity37 said : ‘ we inherited a situation where far too many people were unemployed , where we were n’t creating enough jobs in our country			0
‘ since i became prime minister , we have n’t solved or tackled all of unemployment , but we have got 1.85million more people in work today than when i became prime minister			1
‘ i sit round that @entity53 council table with the 27 other countries – i was there last week			0

i am determined to go further and we will keep working through our plan to secure a brighter future for hard - working people			0
’ yesterday ’s figures showed that three quarters of all @entity55 aged 16 to 64 are now in work after the employment rate reached 73.2 per cent			1
this is the joint highest level since records began in 1971 , the same figure having also been achieved in 2004 and 2005			2
there are now 608,000 more people in employment than a year ago			1
that is 30.89million people in work compared with 29.04million in april 2010 , the last month before the government came to power			0
the unemployment rate has also tumbled and is now 5.7 per cent , the lowest in seven years			2
the @entity55 has the third lowest rate in the @entity53 , behind only @entity86 and @entity87			2
the number claiming jobseeker ’s allowance fell by 38,600 in january to 823,000 , the 27th consecutive monthly fall and the lowest since 2008			2
pay rises , excluding bonuses , rose by 1.7 per cent in the year to december , which is lower than last month ’s growth of 1.8 per cent , but still more than three times higher than inflation that month of 0.5 per cent			1
inflation has since dropped again to 0.3 per cent – a 55 - year low – further easing the squeeze on family finances as the cost of living falls			1
including bonuses , workers saw a pay rise of 2.1 per cent in the past 12 months , the highest rate since 2011			1

’ @entity120 , chief economist at the @entity121 , said wages would continue to rise as competition for talent intensified			0
‘ two thirds of @entity121 members are planning pay rises at least in line with inflation over the coming months , ’ he added			0
@entity30 was last night accused of ‘ talking down the economy ’ by highlighting a small rise in youth unemployment – despite the fact that the overall jobless total fell sharply			2
the number of 16 to 24 - year - olds out of work rose by 3,000 between october and december to 740,000			2
@entity30 said the figure was ‘ extremely worrying ’ – even though youth unemployment has actually fallen by 21 per cent or 198,000 under the @entity12 , having risen by nearly 44 per cent under the last @entity30 government			1
@entity142 mp @entity141 said : ‘ @entity30 is talking down the economy ... [ the party ] is proving it is not good for @entity55			0
