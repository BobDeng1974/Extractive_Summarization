by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 behind the doors of a modest industrial unit in @entity4 lies one of the world ’s most advanced sports - science laboratories			1
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 have all been pushed to their limits in the space - aged facility and this summer @entity13 have been using the technology to enhance their preparations for the new season			1
there is no expense spared			0
funded by @entity19 , a team of technicians help elite athletes fine - tune their craft and , in return , use the data to develop their own products			2
the resources on offer are beyond the financial boundaries of most professional sports teams ; here they do not bat an eyelid at spending £ 80,000 on a single running machine			2
the equipment is all state - of - the - art. there are pools that generate currents to replicate an @entity38 50metre freestyle final , treadmills so powerful they require three - foot deep foundations and atmospheric chambers that can recreate conditions ranging from the @entity44 to the @entity45			1
cognitive : harlequins have spent the off - season trying to improve decision - making in a @entity4 laboratory thought process : harlequins want to make the right decisions at the right time on the pitch this season no expense spared : running machines worth £ 80,000 each are used at the state - of - the - art facility from a sporting perspective , it is all about marginal gains in performance			1
intensive testing is carried out and the results can be used throughout the season to help determine optimum procedures			2
cognition is one of the six pillars of expertise and @entity13 have been working closely with the scientists to develop a brain - tuning tool			1
director of rugby @entity73 flew out to @entity75 this summer , where he spent time with the @entity76 , the @entity78 @entity77 team , who are already using similar technology			1
it is designed to improve decision - making and @entity73 is hoping the project will help maximise the training hours spent with his squad			1
‘ you get less and less time with players on pitch , ’ said @entity73			2
‘ the hits are getting bigger and bigger , so how much contact work can you do in training ? three test matches against the @entity95 at the end of a long season - good or bad idea ? we need to make sure that we do n’t get to a stage where the players are so tired that they become disposed to an injury			1
‘ that ’s where you need to bring in things like the cognitive tool			1
there are always players out injured – that ’s a fact , it ’s a collision sport			0
sometimes they do n’t make any decisions for months on end , because they do n’t play			0
we ’re hoping that through technology our guys can keep working on their decisions even when they ’re not playing			0
i ’m not a scientist in any way shape or form , but it makes sense			0
over in @entity121 , even the coaches were doing it			0
we knew they were the one club that used the technology and they were really open to us			0
it ’s about firing the brain			0
‘ pedigree : famous sportspeople including @entity8 ( left ) and @entity9 ( right ) have used the laboratory sports science : the facility in @entity4 aims to optimise the ' six pillars ' necessary to improve performance calm : @entity13 director of rugby @entity135 is keen to improve his player 's decision - making this year sports science is constantly spreading its influence over elite sport and @entity13 are developing their intelligence inside a darkened room at the @entity144			1
the west @entity146 club suffered from well - documented injury problems last season but the new technology will not just be reserved for those battling with fitness problems			2
it can help identify individual strengths and weaknesses , as well as adjusting for jet - lag , hydration , stress and other factors			2
‘ by separating the brain training from the physical training , you can accumulate all that practice without the risk of injury and physical fatigue , ’ said @entity159 , head of research and development at the @entity162 ‘ a lot of work has been done with baseball and @entity173 , so the obvious transfer is into rugby , football and cricket ; that ’s where we ’re starting			2
you can show a snapshot of a scenario or you can show video footage that stops at the critical time			2
‘ in cricket , we are filming the fast bowler and we stop it before the ball is released			0
by and large they recognise the shape of the bowler , what they do with their arm , recognising the pattern and making a bet based on that information			0
while we know that a small change in hydration status affects things like strength and stamina , we ’re just starting to see that it can have a significant impact on cognition as well			1
’ assessment : harlequins front row @entity209 ( right ) runs on a state - of - the - art treadmill in @entity4 facilities : the laboratory has atmospheric chambers , treadmills , cycling machines and 50metre @entity38 pools @entity218 , the @entity220 brothers and @entity221 have also been put through their paces in the testing house and , by collating intelligence from a range of the world ’s leading sportsmen , the staff are able to challenge the accepted theories of sports science			1
by testing the other five pillars of performance - strength , stamina , hydration , metabolism and recovery - the findings can be disseminated by a panel that includes @entity238 , head nutritionist at @entity240 , and dr @entity241 , head of athletic performance at @entity243			1
‘ what makes sports science so dynamic is that you have coaches that ca n’t afford to wait for a robust evidence base , ’ said @entity159			1
‘ if you ’re @entity249 and you know that you ’ve got to do everything you can to beat @entity251 , then as long as something does n’t have a negative impact , you probably need to give it a go			0
‘ but does it all really work ? does the effectiveness of an ice bath blunt over time ? there is a bit of evidence at the moment			2
five years ago everyone jumped in ice baths but now we ’re starting to be a little bit more circumspect ; it might not all be positive			0
pillars of performance : strength , stamina , hydration , metabolism , recovery and cognition are all tested skipper : @entity13 prop @entity275 has taken over the captaincy from @entity277 for the coming season ‘ we ’ve got a cold - water pool and a hot - water pool , with three different depths			1
is it the effect of the cold or is it the hydrostatic pressure and the depth of the water ? should you stand neck deep or waist deep ? the scientists at @entity19 can help us work that out			0
’ since “ marginal gains ” became a buzzword under @entity291 during his time as performance director a @entity294 , all elite sports teams have been searching for their own points of difference			1
whether it is a case of sleeping with the same pillow on away trips , or immersing into multi-million pound facilities			0
‘ what distinguishes first place from fourth place ? ’ said @entity302 , head of strength and conditioning at @entity13 , who kick off their season against @entity306 at @entity307			1
‘ it ’s about that extra two or three per cent			0
it comes down to small elements and we ’re trying to improve wherever we can			2
nutrition is a key pillar in making those differences and that ’s why our relationship with @entity322 is important			0
if you do n’t get the basics right , then the rest can fall down			0
' you have all this information and you need to best way to process it			0
no one ’s quite there yet , especially in rugby , but over the next four or five years i think there will be a lot more investment in data analytics			0
’ @entity338 room : the players can have their temperatures controlled in this state - of - the - art water facility @entity13 is an official partner of @entity322 - the sports nutrition product of choice for elite and amateur ( sport ) players , visit : @entity350			1

@entity13 spent off - season at sports - science laboratory in @entity4
state - of - the - art facility used by @entity355 , @entity9 and @entity10
director of rugby @entity135 hopes it will improve cognitive thinking
@entity135 flew out to @entity75 to spend time with @entity76
@entity218 , @entity221 and @entity220 brothers have also used facility
strength , stamina , hydration , metabolism and recovery also assessed
along with cognition , these six things ' pillars of expertise ' in sports science
