by @entity0 published : 04:44 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 07:31 est , 23 april 2013 quick - fire : the infra - red finger will allow employers to test workers for alcohol in just eight seconds millions of workers could face a daily alcohol test using a fingerprint scanner before they start their jobs			1
the new device which uses near infra - red light to measure blood alcohol content in the skin will give employers a result in just eight seconds , making it possible to test 450 employees per hour			1
the @entity19 scanner will be ideal for companies to test if employees still have any alcohol in their system from the night before			1
public sector staff in local government and the @entity26 and workers in the transport and security industries are likely to be the first to be targeted			1
but unions have slammed the tactic as draconian and said employers should be trying to help employees with drinking problems not catching them out			1
@entity34 , the company which distributes the device , says that daily alcohol testing is the ' only true way of eliminating on - duty alcohol impairment '			1
drug and alcohol testing at work has become a hot topic in recent years , with companies claiming heavy drinkers cost them millions in loss of productivity every year			2
the new scanner raises the prospect of companies being able to test workers at any time of the day			0
@entity34 told @entity52 the practice is already commonplace in many workplaces in the @entity55 with one of their clients including the @entity59 factory			0
but director @entity60 said it is important for employees to be consulted before a regular testing system is brought in			2
crackdown : the easy - to - use scanners could be used to target the ' liquid lunch ' culture she added : ' one of the things that companies say to us is that if they bring in random testing then individuals feel like they are being targeted			0
' but this way it involves everyone from the managing director down			0
it 's difficult to say anyone is being fingered or singled out			0
' from our point of view it 's important that any alcohol testing policy that is brought in has the full support of employees			2
' but @entity87 general secretary @entity86 condemned the move as using ' a sledgehammer to crack a nut '			1
he told @entity91 : ' if workers have a problem with alcohol , their employers should not be relying on a gadget to entrap them but should be providing them with proper support			0
' a statement on the @entity34 website reads : ' @entity101 screening can deter the casual user , but those with a serious alcohol problem are far less likely to change their inherent behaviour patterns			0
' for this reason this form of occasional screening can fail to have the impact the company is looking for and alcohol use can continue to cost the company , and thousands of others , billions of dollars a year			2
' testing every person , every day changes the underlying behaviour itself			0

@entity19 device gives a pass or fail result in just eight seconds
will catch out employees who still have alcohol in system from night before
public sector staff , transport and security industries likely to be targeted
unions slam draconian tactics as using ' a sledgehammer to crack a nut '
