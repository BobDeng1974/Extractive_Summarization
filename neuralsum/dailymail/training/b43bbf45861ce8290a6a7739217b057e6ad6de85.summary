by @entity0 , political editor for @entity1 most politicians have been known to kiss a baby on the campaign trail			1
but it seems today @entity6 has been ready to pucker up for just about anyone			0
there was new evidence today that the undecided voters , thought to be as many as 500,000 people , could be more inclined to vote no. but mr @entity6 today insisted he was confident voters would back independence when they go to the polls from 7am tomorrow			2
in an attempt to win over voters he embarked on a fresh charm offensive , posing for selfies and showering wellwishers with kisses during a walkabout in @entity22 shopping centre today			1
and on a visit to @entity56 in @entity57 , he took the chance to kiss @entity28 singer @entity27			1
he also travelled to @entity59 in @entity60 during his final campaign push , hailing @entity15 's ' date with destiny '			2
kissing the first minister seemed to be the only thing people in @entity59 wanted to do on wednesday afternoon in the sunshine of @entity59 , @entity60 , it seemed supporters were queuing up to meet the first minister , give him a hug and get a kiss mr @entity6 has joked about the number of selfies he has taken during the campaign , as voters rush to record the historic referendum anyone with a camera wanted their own photo with mr @entity6 as he toured @entity59 during his final campaign push throughout the referendum campaign , mr @entity6 has been repeatdly asked to pose for selfies , as he was today with a voter outside the @entity85 charity shop in the @entity22 shopping centre mr @entity6 also smiled for the smartphone cameras at @entity24 as the latest polls suggested the result is too close to call on his final campaign push , mr @entity6 also visited the headquarters of @entity91 in @entity57 travelling around @entity15 in a helicopter , mr @entity6 gave onlookers a thumbs up as he predicted his campaign for independence would win speaking on a visit to an engineering firm in @entity25 , @entity99 , the @entity101 leader said : ' my confidence is based on what 's happening in the streets and communities around @entity15			1
' i think there 's a very substantial movement towards yes because people understand this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to take the future of this country into our hands			0
' when people go into the polling booths tomorrow they are going to vote for something , for a that vision of more prosperous but also a more just society , that 's what 's going to motivate people in the polling stations tomorrow			0
' mr @entity6 added : ' i think the movement is to @entity42			1
i 'm certain of that actually			0
i think we 're being helped enormously by two things			0
' one is the total negativity of the no campaign , it 's a dismal , depressing no campaign			2
' but also the positive message of @entity42			1
we see in the employment figures today , a 45,000 increase in @entity28 jobs , soaring beyond the @entity137 level , @entity28 unemployment well down , that 's fantastic news for @entity15			0
' thousands of @entity42 supporters tonight gathered in @entity142 , @entity26 as a show of support for independence the gathering came as a new poll put @entity42 on 49 per cent and @entity148 on 51 per cent , suggesting the result is simply too close to call mr @entity6 urged voters to ignore the ' arguments of politicians and the blizzard of statistics ' and instead embrace the chance to put ' @entity15 's future in @entity15 's hands ' there have been growing fears about intimidation from the @entity42 campaign , but today 's event appeared to pass off peacefully but in a barnstorming speech today , @entity163 tore into mr @entity6 , insisting @entity15 does not belong to him or any other politician , declaring : ' @entity15 belongs to all of us			1
' speaking without notes , he urged anyone with doubts about the risks of separation to vote no to save the @entity172 , adding : ' what we created together , let no nationalist split asunder			0
' the speech could become seen as one of the defining moments of the campaign , and reignite questions about whether mr @entity163 should have fronted the no campaign from the start .			0
