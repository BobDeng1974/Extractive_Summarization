demands : @entity1 wants @entity2 , near @entity3 , to hand over a share of the thousands of euros the @entity9 80 - year - old whose diy restoration ruined a 19th - century work of art is suing the church where it hangs after her hapless handiwork became an unlikely cash cow			1
@entity1 wants @entity2 , near @entity3 , to hand over a share of the thousands of euros it has earned in admission fees since her disastrous decoration job became a tourist attraction			1
and she is also instructing a legal team to explore copyrighting her rough and ready renovation to retain future profits , reports national television station @entity27			1
the octogenarian sparked widespread outrage in august when she marched , oil brush and paint in hand , into the tiny church in the town of @entity35 and daubed over @entity36 ’s @entity1 ( @entity37 ) without permission			1
the 120 - year - old fresco of @entity40 wearing a crown of thorns was terrifyingly transformed into what many have said now looks like a monkey			1
she was labelled insane and the worldwide attention reportedly brought on a series of panic attacks , but she insisted throughout that the church ’s priest had allowed her to repair the piece			0
locals were horrified and , to add insult to injury , it emerged that a local catholic cultural foundation had earlier received money from @entity36 ’s granddaughter , @entity57 , to restore the crumbling damp - ridden fresco to its former glory			2
before and after : @entity1 , 80 , painted her crude rendition of @entity40 's face ( right ) over @entity64 's original ( left ) but @entity66 ’s sloppy workmanship has ended up as a mixed blessing for the church that , despite being mocked across the world , has seen a huge upsurge in the number of visitors			1
it was to prevent what town mayor @entity74 described as ‘ disruptive pilgrims ’ from overtaking the area that the @entity78 , the church ’s owners , started charging a € 1 entrance fee			0
and @entity1 , or behold the monkey as it has now jokingly been called , made more than € 2,000 in just the first four days			1
a staggering 30,000 visitors are said to have passed through the doors since august , but the fee was only introduced on saturday			0
the current total of ‘ gate receipts ’ is not known			0
tourists flock to see the damaged 19th century @entity89 ( right ) by artist @entity36 at the @entity90 , at @entity35 in @entity9 's @entity92 region spokesman @entity93 told @entity95 newspaper : ‘ out of 20 people who came in , only one person put in any money , so we decided to introduce an admission fee			2
‘ although , despite that , it ’s true that one day we also had someone who dropped in a € 50 note			0
’ and visitor @entity106 said : ‘ as we were in the area , we thought we ’d go and see the work			0
it ’s true that before all this we never knew , or had heard of , or even knew where @entity35 was			0
’ the interest has led to @entity66 and her family hiring lawyers to seek royalties , and the @entity78 also hiring its own legal team to counter the claims			1
@entity35 's mayor @entity74 about the @entity1 fresco behind him which was damaged @entity35 's councilman , @entity119 ( centre ) walks with two professional restorers to the @entity123 church since its inception , her ‘ art ’ has been spoofed by millions across the world with many others seeking to cash in on the calamitous creation			2
a @entity132 bakery honoured the work by squirting chocolate replicas onto crepes , and it is available to buy as an investment in best - selling @entity139 computer game @entity138			0
several smartphone apps have also sprung up , allowing users to ‘ eccehomonise ’ themselves by restoring their pictures in a similar style			0
and budget airline @entity144 has launched a € 12 flight for tourists to travel to @entity3 from any of their airports to see the ‘ creative restoration ’ .			2
