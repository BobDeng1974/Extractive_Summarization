the new @entity1 milkshake is packed with calories not even the most deluded person would pop into a @entity1 doughnut and coffee bar for a healthy meal			1
after all , the chain , which has become a fixture on the @entity10 @entity9 in just a few sticky years , is famed for its indulgent sugary treats			2
but the calorie content of its latest range might cause even @entity15 — the world ’s most famous doughnut lover — to raise an eyebrow			1
it has been revealed that @entity1 ’s new ‘ doughnut - inspired ’ milkshakes contain up to 612 calories — nearly as much as a roast chicken meal or a @entity24 ’s cheeseburger with fries			1
add a doughnut — perhaps with a caramel crunch or vanilla cappuccino topping — and your morning ‘ snack ’ will give you a staggering 1,000 calories			1
that ’s half the calories that a woman needs in one day and 40 per cent of those recommended for a man			1
even without the doughnut , the shake is more than a quarter of a woman ’s daily recommended calorie intake			1
short of injecting yourself with glucose , there ca n’t be many quicker ways to pile on the pounds			0
@entity1 ’s addition to the highly calorific milkshake market is just the tip of the iceberg			1
everywhere you look , multinational coffee chains and takeaway outlets are plying us with belly - busting shakes , gut - bulging smoothies and waist - expanding frappuccinos			0
so just how bad for us are these shakes ? and how on earth did the big food companies persuade so many adults to consume what used to be drinks for children ? @entity1 was created in 1937 and arrived in the @entity10 from @entity63 in 2003 , when it opened an outlet in @entity65			1
setting up stall in @entity10 ’s poshest shop was a statement of intent			1
the company is coy about its ingredients and each item ’s nutritional content the company wanted to change the image of the doughnut from a cheap and cheerful treat to something more luxurious , expensive and profitable			1
in the past 11 years , it has largely succeeded			0
today , the company , sells 60 million doughnuts a year in the @entity10 — 165,000 every day			1
the company attracts the sort of loyalty normally reserved for pop stars and iphones			0
when a new store opened in @entity85 in 2011 , 1,000 people queued overnight			0
with this kind of devoted fanbase , the arrival of yet more calorific treats was inevitable			0
and they sure are fattening			0
@entity1 ’s strawberries - and - cream shake — a blend of fruit juice , sugar , cream and shortbread biscuit — contains that staggering figure : 612 calories			1
the chocolate - and - honeycomb - topped @entity99 has 508 calories , while the @entity103 shake — cream , cocoa powder and chocolate flakes — has 555			1
the closest it comes to a ‘ healthy ’ shake is its ‘ @entity109 ’ , made with espresso , chai tea and cream			1
but that is still packed with 446 calories			0
the company is coy about its ingredients and each item ’s nutritional content			2
by law it does n’t have to display them online or on the cups , but the berry - and - cream version of the shake on sale in @entity63 , with a similar calorie count , contains 24g of saturated fat and 71g — that ’s 17 teaspoons — of sugar			1
it ’s difficult to imagine who this ‘ coronary in a cup ’ is aimed at			1
and if a packet of crisps with 180 calories is classed as ‘ junk ’ food , what on earth do we call these drinks ? rubbish - tip treats ? perhaps it ’s unfair to pick on @entity1			1
others are just as guilty			0
@entity145 sells a gigantic white chocolate mocha coffee with whipped cream containing 613 calories			2
at @entity149 , the large caramel iced frappe — made with skimmed milk — has 460 calories , while the @entity153 has 485 calories			1
the companies selling these sugary , fatty beverages insist they are only offering consumers a choice			0
@entity160 , chief marketing officer at @entity161 , said : ‘ @entity1 offers a range of drink options			1
milkshakes range in calories from 446kcals to 612kcals , making them occasional indulgent treats rather than an everyday drink			2
’ but what alarms experts is the way the body reacts to calories in liquid form compared to those found in solid food			2
dr @entity181 , spokesperson for the @entity182 , says : ‘ you are less likely to feel as satisfied with liquid calories			2
and because it ’s in liquid form , your blood sugar levels can go higher more quickly — then drop again			2
that may leave you feeling hungry soon afterwards			0
not many customers go into a @entity1 store for a square meal at lunch			2
‘ if you had a roast chicken meal or burger with fries , you would hopefully stop what you are doing , sit down and concentrate on eating it , ’ dr @entity181 says			2
‘ but these drinks are almost mindless eating and snacking			0
two hours after you have one you may be ready for a roast dinner			0
’ the arrival of the mega-calorie milkshake does n’t just reflect the desire of big businesses to flog us sugar and fat in ever more creative ways			0
with more calories than a burger and chips , the new @entity1 milkshake takes junk food to a new level it also highlights the creeping infantilism of our diet			2
this fashion for childish food is everywhere			0
you see it in the rise of the sugary ‘ doughnut - flavoured ’ milkshake and the popularity of doughnuts themselves			1
you see it in our enthusiasm for iced frappuccinos and hot chocolate with whipped cream in coffee bars			0
you see it in the extraordinary popularity of @entity254 sweets among adults			0
one of @entity257 ’s biggest successes in recent years had been the @entity258 sweet			0
‘ @entity260 ’ now appears on dozens of products bought by adults			0
@entity10 has yet to reach the obesity levels of @entity63			0
but with this fashion for children ’s drinks and food among adults , it wo n’t be long before we are turned into a nation of blubbery @entity15 .			0
