by @entity0 last updated at 3:15 pm on 11th january 2012 a nuclear - powered , car - sized spacecraft hurtling toward @entity2 is preparing to fire its thrusters and put itself on course for an august landing			1
the one - ton rover , named @entity8 , has been cruising along since rocketing from @entity9 last november			0
the engine firing is the most important task @entity8 will perform during its 352 - million - mile flight to the red planet			0
the one - ton rover , named @entity8 , has been cruising along since rocketing from @entity9 last november , and is due to fire its engines to steer towards @entity2			1
it 's the crucial moment of its 352 - million - mile flight to the red planet previous robotic explorers have had to adjust their paths several times en route to ensure a bull 's - eye landing			0
' just because this is a well - travelled road to @entity2 given the number of trips we 've made , i 'm very careful to not let that experience cause us to be complacent , ' said @entity29 of the @entity30 , which manages the £ 1.6 billion mission			1
curiosity has already travelled 80 million miles and will be travelling at 10,200 mph relative to the @entity9			0
the team uploaded commands calling for the spacecraft to fire its eight thrusters for nearly three hours , redirecting it closer to its target			2
the one - ton curiosity rover - @entity8 has already travelled 80 million miles and will be travelling at 10,200 mph relative to the @entity9 though it will execute the move without human interference , engineers will be on standby in the off chance that they have to abort			0
' we should be very , very close to our desired aim point at the top of the @entity2 atmosphere , ' after the manoeuvre , said @entity29			2
if @entity8 did not tweak its position , it would have missed @entity2 altogether			1
engineers did this by design to prevent the rocket 's upper stage from hitting @entity2 - instead , it will sail into space			1
once @entity8 separated from the upper stage and was on its way , the team has several chances to fine - tune its trajectory before touchdown			2
@entity8 , whose formal name is the @entity65 , is aiming for a 96 - mile - wide crater near the @entity2 equator that boasts a towering mountain in the centre			1
the six - wheel , nuclear - powered rover planned to drive to the lower flanks and examine the layered deposits to determine whether the area once had conditions capable of supporting microbial life			0
armed with a suite of instruments including a laser to zap into bedrock and a jackhammer , @entity8 is more sophisticated than previous @entity2 surface spacecraft			1
despite its capabilities , it wo n't be able to detect life			0
instead , it will hunt for the chemical building blocks of life during its two - year mission .			0

£ 1.6 billion machine will fire thrusters for three hours
will steer @entity8 towards @entity2 's upper atmosphere
aiming towards crater on @entity2 's surface with mountain in the centre
