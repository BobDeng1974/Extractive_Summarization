the @entity1 will help make @entity2 prime minister even if @entity3 finish 40 seats behind the @entity5 at the general election , @entity0 said last night			1
the @entity8 first minister said she would form an @entity10 alliance with @entity3 and other smaller parties regardless of how many mps @entity12 wins on may 7			1
while mr @entity2 has ruled out going into coalition with the @entity1 , ms @entity0 's remarks raise the prospect of @entity3 ruling as a minority government - despite winning fewer votes and seats than the @entity5			1
protesters wearing masks of @entity1 leader @entity0 hold placards outside @entity25 , a foreign affairs think - tank , where @entity3 leader @entity2 delivered a speech in @entity28 this morning the @entity1 could win as many as 50 mps in @entity8 - allowing mr @entity2 to become prime minister even if he falls far short of a majority			1
her comments came as @entity3 slipped four points behind the @entity5 in the latest polls - with @entity12 's @entity5 moving to 36 per cent			2
however , the @entity1 could win as many as 50 mps in @entity8 - allowing mr @entity2 to become prime minister even if he falls far short of a majority			1
ms @entity0 was asked on @entity39 's @entity38 whether her party would be ready to prop up a @entity3 government if the party had fewer seats than the conservatives			1
she replied : ' yes			0
even if the @entity5 are the largest party , if there is an anti @entity49 majority , my offer to @entity3 is to work together to keep the @entity5 out			2
' asked if this would remain her position even if mr @entity12 had 30 more mps than mr @entity2 , she confirmed : ' if there is an anti @entity49 majority , yes , that 's what i 've been saying all along - i 'm not sure why there 's any confusion about it - that we would work with @entity3 to stop the @entity5 getting into @entity62			1
' and if the margin was as wide as 40 mps , she said : ' if they ca n't command a majority they ca n't be a government , that 's the basic rule of how governments are formed i 'd have thought			2
' the @entity1 leader @entity0 - campaigning in @entity70 today - said she would help make @entity2 prime minister even if @entity3 finish 40 seats behind the @entity5 ms @entity0 was pictured with three - year - old @entity73 and @entity74 for @entity75 during a visit to @entity77 , a ceramic painting studio in the city ms @entity0 also rejected an independent study which said there was a ' significant disconnect ' between the @entity1 's claims to be an anti-austerity party and plans that implied it would be spending less than @entity3 by 2019/20			1
the @entity86 accused the major parties of keeping voters ' in the dark ' by spelling out only the ' broad outlines ' of their tax and spend plans following the may 7 poll , though it singled out the @entity95 for being more transparent than their rivals about their intentions			0
@entity2 , pictured in @entity25 , central @entity28 today , could become prime minister even if he wins fewer votes and mps than @entity12 the thinktank 's deputy director @entity102 said : ' there are genuinely big differences between the main parties ' fiscal plans			1
' the electorate has a real choice , although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice			0
' conservatives say they would eliminate the deficit by 2017/18 and start to run a surplus while @entity3 says it will reduce the deficit each year and balance the books ' as soon as possible ' during the five - year term			2
the @entity86 said the @entity49 plans were ' predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases ' , and could involve ' further real cuts to unprotected departments of around £ 30 billion '			0
@entity3 's plans were consistent with a pledge not to borrow for day - to - day spending but ' would leave borrowing at £ 26 billion a year in today 's terms ' , it said			2
the @entity86 said the @entity95 had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017 - 18 , revealing that they are aiming for tightening more than @entity3 but less than the conservatives			0
while the @entity1 would ' cut less to start with ' , the implication of the plans spelt out in their manifesto would be that the ' period of austerity would be longer than under the other three parties we consider ' , it said			0
responding to the comments , @entity95 leader @entity95 said ms @entity0 was going to ' ignore the will of the people ' , if she chose to support the smaller of the two main parties at @entity141			0
he added : ' she 's going to ignore how people vote and she 's just going to insist on her personal preference			0
' she told the @entity39 's @entity38 that ' if [ the @entity49 ] ca n't command a majority , they ca n't be a government '			0
ms @entity0 has repeatedly said she would work with @entity3 to ' get rid of the @entity5 ' if the @entity1 had enough @entity101			1
the prime minister , speaking in @entity146 with the foreign secretary @entity147 , has called that prospect on an @entity150 ' frightening ' and claimed it would lead to ' economic ruin ' conservative leader @entity12 has called that prospect ' frightening ' and said it would lead to ' economic ruin '			0
while the @entity1 had only six mps at @entity141 in the last @entity158 , recent polls suggest they could win the majority of @entity8 's 59 seats			2
that could leave the party holding the balance of power if the election resulted in a hung parliament .			0

@entity1 leader vowed to prop up @entity3 even if the @entity5 finish clear winners
it means mr @entity2 could be *pm* with fewer votes and @entity101 than the @entity5
he would by @entity3 government kept in power by the @entity1
mr @entity2 has ruled at a formal coalition with the @entity8 nationalists
but he has refused to rule out working with the @entity1 vote by vote
