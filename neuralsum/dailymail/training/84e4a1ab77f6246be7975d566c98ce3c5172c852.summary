a 911 dispatcher broke the rules to talk a toddler 's grandmother through how to give the youngster cpr - and ultimately save his life			1
seventeen - month - old @entity6 had been feeling unwell when he went down for a nap in @entity8 , @entity9 in december as his grandmother , @entity10 , watched him			1
suddenly the boy suffered a seizure and stopped breathing			1
his mother , @entity14 , immediately called 911 and desperately begged for help			1
' @entity16 , my baby , my baby ! ' she can be heard saying on the 911 call , first shared by @entity21			0
' no ! no ! what do we do ? ' @entity10 can be heard asking			0
@entity30 had a choice : even though he knows cpr , the police department does not have emergency medical dispatch certification , so he is not allowed to give out cpr instructions over the phone			1
' without some sort of life - saving measures , the child would expire , ' @entity30 told wsls			1
' i was n't gon na let that happen , even if it meant being reprimanded			0
' he said his chief , @entity53 , was also in the room during the call and heard the situation			0
as soon as they locked eyes , @entity30 said he knew that @entity53 supported him taking action			2
so he got to work			0
relief : his grandmother @entity10 , left , and mother @entity14 , right , were able to get him breathing fighter : @entity6 is now well again - and his family said that they will be life - long friends with @entity30 ' i 'm not gon na let you lose him , ' he said on the call			1
' put him on your kitchen table ok ? ' he told them to use two fingers to make sure the boy 's head was tilted back slightly			2
' all right , barely pinch his nose off and put your mouth over top of his mouth , and i need you to blow in it just a second and see ok ? ' @entity30 instructed			2
the women then report that the boy 's chest is moving again and that the color is returning to his face			0
@entity30 instructs them to turn him on his side in case the boy vomits			2
' it was the scariest day of my life , ' @entity6 's mother @entity14 said			0
' all i could do was say a prayer , over and over and over , " please @entity22 do n't take my son from me "			0
' the family has since visited the police department to meet @entity30 in person and thank him - and said they will be returning throughout the years as @entity94 grows			1
' you 're a lifelong friend , ' @entity14 told him			0

seventeen - month - old @entity6 stopped breathing at his @entity9 home after suffering a seizure when he was sick
his grandmother *frantically* called 911 and dispatcher @entity30 picked up
his police department does not have an emergency medical dispatch certification but he decided to tell her how to give cpr anyway
the little boy is now back to good health and his family says they will be ' lifelong ' friends with @entity30
