by @entity0 findings bring the collections of stone tools , animal bone and @entity6 remains under renewed study our modern language can be traced back to @entity6 living half a million years ago , scientists have claimed			1
research increasingly seems to indicate that our close cousins , the @entity6 , were much more similar to us than imagined even a decade ago			0
@entity14 researchers argue that the last common ancestor we shared with the @entity6 around half a million years ago , shared speech and language with modern humans			1
they believe that the origins of out modern language are ten times older than previously thought			1
the scientists at the @entity23 in the @entity14 are interested in the implications for understanding present day linguistic diversity			0
popular opinion is that they spoke in primitive grunts , but neanderthal man successfully inhabited vast swathes of western @entity30 for several hundreds of thousands of years , during harsh ages and milder interglacial periods			0
historians know that our closest cousins share a common ancestor with us around half million years ago , probably the species homo heidelbergensis			2
but what is relatively unknown is what their cognitive capabilities were like			0
experts also question why modern humans succeeded in replacing them after thousands of years of cohabitation			0
recently , due to new palaeoanthropological and archaeological discoveries and the reassessment of older data , but especially to the availability of ancient dna , we have started to realise that their fate was much more intertwined with ours			0
an artist 's impression of a den. scientists argue modern language and speech are an ancient feature of our lineage dating back at least to the most recent ancestor we shared with the @entity6			1
their interpretation of scare evidence contradicts a popular scenario believed by most language scientists , who think our modern language began with a sudden emergence of modernity @entity69 researchers @entity71 @entity70 , said that far from being slow brutes , their cognitive capacities and culture were comparable to ours			1
the duo , who have looked at past findings in detail , argue that essentially modern language and speech are an ancient feature of our lineage dating back at least to the most recent ancestor we shared with the @entity6 and the @entity83 ( another form of humanity known mostly from their genome )			2
their interpretation of scare evidence contradicts a popular scenario believed by most language scientists , who think our modern language began with a sudden emergence of modernity presumably due to one or a few genetic mutations that gave rise to language			1
in contrast , the two researchers think it was a slower process of gradual accumulation of biological and cultural progress			0
it seems hard to believe that @entity6 shared language as well as some dinner favourites with modern humans			2
the researchers thinks that @entity6 adopted language slowly their paper is published in @entity110 in @entity111 and pushed back the origins of modern language by ten times what was previously thought			1
scientists had thought that our modern language began around 50,000 years ago			1
but the pair believe that it could have started somewhere between the origins of our genus , @entity121 , some 1.8 million years ago , and the emergence of @entity123			2
the scientists said that given that archaeological and genetic data shows modern humans spreading from @entity127 mixed with @entity6 and @entity83 , then just as we carry around some of their genes , our languages may preserve traces of theirs			2
they think that their idea can be tested by comparing the structural properties of @entity127 and @entity136 languages and by computer simulations of language spread			0
however , it might be harder to prove that @entity6 contributed to specific words in our modern vocabularies .			0

origins of modern language are ten times older than thought and could date back half a million years , according to @entity14 researchers
it contradicts the popular idea that our modern language began with a sudden emergence of modernity presumably due to one or a few genetic mutations that gave rise to language
the scientists claim that far from being slow brutes , @entity6 ' cognitive capacities and culture were comparable to ours
