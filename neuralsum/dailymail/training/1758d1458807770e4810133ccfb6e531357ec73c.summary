@entity7 , from @entity16 , had sent her gown to a local dry cleaner when @entity4 *hit*
the store and all its *contents* were destroyed with the *exception* of mrs @entity7 's gown , which had been stored in a secure box
the store owner , who had lost the ticket attached to the dress , had no idea who it belonged to , so when he reopened a year later in a new location , the dress was displayed in the window
