@entity10 said @entity11 had not yet booked a plane ticket for @entity13 after the deal was sealed to allay fears that evidence extracted through torture will be used against the terror suspect at a retrial			0
last month , @entity13 unexpectedly volunteered to leave the country as soon as the treaty between the @entity8 and @entity6 is ratified by both countries			1
the deportation of radical @entity23 cleric @entity3 took a step closer after the @entity6 government agreed a treaty with the @entity8 home secretary @entity27 announced in april that she had thrashed out a mutual assistance treaty with @entity6 , guaranteeing @entity13 the right to a fair trial			1
human rights judges in @entity8 and @entity32 had halted his removal to @entity6 on the grounds some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture			1
the agreement has now been approved by both houses of the @entity6 parliament but must still be signed off by the country 's @entity41			1
the @entity8 government expects the treaty to be ratified in @entity8 by june 21			2
it does not name @entity13 directly , but it states that any evidence used to prosecute someone who is to be deported can not be used ' unless the prosecution in the receiving @entity49 proves beyond any doubt that the statement has been provided out of free - will and choice and was not obtained by torture or ill - treatment by the authorities of the receiving @entity49 '			0
home secretary @entity27 has pinned her hopes on the treaty to finally end the decade - long saga of government attempts to oust him september 16 1993 - the @entity6 father of five claims asylum when he arrives in @entity8 on a forged passport			1

august 2005 - the preacher is arrested under immigration rules as the government seeks to deport him to @entity6			1
april 2008 - the @entity84 rules that deporting him would breach his human rights because evidence used against him in @entity6 may have been obtained through torture			1

april 23 2013 - @entity84 rejects government request to appeal			0
asked whether mr @entity11 had booked @entity13 's plane ticket to @entity6 , a @entity10 spokesman said : ' obviously the announcement from @entity6 today is good news but from our perspective the case is still on - going and the prime minister is clear in his determination to put @entity3 back on a plane to @entity6			1
' ministers have been trying for a decade to send @entity13 to @entity6 , where he is accused of plotting a terrorist atrocity to coincide with the millennium			2
his removal was originally approved by the @entity8 courts , only to be halted by the @entity134 last year			0
judges in @entity32 said he would not get a fair trial because some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture			0
controversially , mrs may opted not to appeal against this verdict			0
instead , she and her ministers secured personal promises from the @entity6 authorities there would be no use of torture evidence , and began the deportation process again in the @entity8 legal system			2
but last november , the @entity151 said it was not satisfied with the assurances , and halted @entity13 ’s removal			0
the court said it must reflect the @entity32 ruling			0
