at least five off - duty @entity1 officers have admitted being present at the savage revenge beating last weekend on the @entity4 , according to reports			1
among the off duty cops were at least two detectives and three other officers , all who witnessed the attack and did little to stop it			1
one of the detectives , an undercover narcotics officer , watched as the violence broke out and chose not to break it up for fear of ruining his cover			1
the five officers were not the only ones present , @entity20 is reporting that the @entity1 is investigating whether several off - duty corrections officers were also there			1
police who saw the violent attack did not begin coming forward until wednesday - four days later			1
before and after : @entity27 suffered a broken spine , fractured ribs , a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve and now may never walk again it is believed that the 38 - year - old biker who was seen on the video smashing his helmet into the @entity37 's window is expected to turn himself in to police for his role in the melee , according to @entity20			1
it is not clear what further role , if any , he played in the fracas			1
investigators have already questioned some of the six individuals seen in the @entity49 video of the assault , according to @entity20			1
they plan to talk to as many as possible , the station noted			2
' this is a complex investigation with a lot of people involved , ' a source told @entity20			2
one of the bikers who spoke to investigators said that mr @entity58 ' drove erratically and bumped the bike on the side , ' adding ' when he bumped that bike on the side , that bike became aggressive because his life was in danger , ' according to @entity20			2
the @entity66 originally reported that the first undercover officer to admit being at the ruthless pounding was not the only cop at the scene , as several members of the motorcycle group - called the @entity73 - are police officers themselves			1
internal affairs of the @entity1 are now investigating whether or not any of these officers were the ones who were pictured hitting the @entity37 , though they do not seem to be worried that the undercover took part when reached by @entity83 for comment , an @entity1 spokesperson said only that the involvement of off - duty officers ' is under investigation			1
' ' it is does not appear that he got involved at the scene , ' a police source told @entity91			2
that said , the undercover officer has hired a lawyer			2
on camera : this shows the moment the @entity37 driver panicked and hit some of the bikers as he tried to get away to protect his wife and child			2
it is believed he hit @entity105 here when they come to a standstill in heavy traffic , it takes moments before a biker jumps off and attacks the vehicle , smashing the driver 's window with his helmet he was not the only one to do so , as longtime partner of @entity27 , the man who was run over by the car , has hired famed defender @entity118			1
' he is the best father i know , ' @entity119 said at a friday press conference			2
' to learn that he almost died and that he may not walk again - that is all still sinking in			1
' it tears me up that anyone could think that @entity27 in anyway deserves what happened to him			1
' @entity105 was one of dozens of bikers who rode alongside a black @entity37 on @entity132 's @entity131 last weekend until a biker slowed down and the vehicles bumped , police said			1
@entity135 captured at the scene shows the suv surrounded by helmeted riders			2
the broken window on the passenger side of the vehicle shows that the male driver was not the only target scary : the @entity144 said they feared for their lives towed away : the car was brought to the @entity1 's 33 precinct on friday in the video , one rider approaches the vehicle and peers into the driver 's side window			2
police said others tried to damage the suv before the driver , @entity58 , took off and ploughed over @entity105			0
the bikers then chased after @entity58 and smashed his car window with their helmets , then pulled him from the suv and beat him to the point where he required stitches			0
@entity58 's wife , @entity163 , has said that her family 's sympathies go out to @entity105 , but that they had to flee a dangerous situation			0
' he is the best father i know , ' @entity119 , @entity105 ' longtime partner , said at a friday press conference support : ms @entity119 , seen with attorney @entity118 and @entity105 ' father @entity170 , said that they are still coping with how to deal with @entity27 's injuries she said her husband was trying to protect her and their 2 - year - old child , who was also in the car at the time			1
@entity105 , who is from @entity178 , @entity179 , suffered a broken spine , fractured ribs , a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve , said his attorney , @entity118			0
his injuries may have left him paralyzed			0
pain : ms @entity119 said that it is wrong to cast any of the blame of the incident on her partner ' he told everyone to move on and go back to riding , and turned his back to the suv to start walking back to his own bike , ' @entity118 said			0
' it was then , with his back to the suv , and as he was in front of it , that he was run over and crushed			0
' @entity119 said a difficult situation has been made worse by what she described as a ' perception ' that some people have about the riders who participated in the rally on sunday			0
' they are not gang members			0
they are not thugs , ' @entity119 said			0
' they are @entity211 drivers , plumbers , military reservists , musicians			0
they are fathers and brothers and sons , and sisters and mothers			0
' she also said @entity105 did n't know any of the people he was riding with on sunday aside from one friend who traveled to @entity223 with him			0
@entity105 was recently arrested in @entity224 , @entity179 , for driving with a revoked license			0
he also never applied for a motorcycle license			0
