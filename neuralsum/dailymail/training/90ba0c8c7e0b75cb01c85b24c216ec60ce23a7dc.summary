by @entity0 the upmarket district of @entity2 in @entity3 is associated more with the chattering classes than affordable housing			1
some of the priciest properties in @entity7 are found in this magnet for the rich and famous			2
so it will surprise some to learn that @entity10 , a swathe of low - density early @entity13 housing that stretches as far as @entity14 , was built specifically to cater for people from all social classes and economic backgrounds			2
it occupies 243 acres bought from @entity19 in 1906			2
today , @entity21 ’s @entity20 and @entity22 hosts @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 are among celebrity residents			2
@entity27 and home : the five - bedroom £ 3.65million @entity29 feels rural yet is in the middle of @entity3 who knows what @entity32 , the socialist architect who designed the suburb , would be thinking , particularly about the fact that @entity29 , the @entity2 house where he lived , is on the market for £ 3.65 million – and that ’s for just half of it			1
the house has five bedrooms and two reception rooms , and its location – with @entity45 on its doorstep – starts to explain its asking price			2
it was built in the mid- 1600s as a farmhouse			2
but by the end of the 18th @entity2 had become a fashionable place for artists and intellectuals , and home - owners began to let out rooms – including at @entity29			1
landscape painters @entity56 and @entity58 ( whose son @entity59 , the novelist , used to play in the garden as a child ) lived in the house , as did the romantic poet @entity63			1
it is also believed to have been used as a meeting place for members of the @entity67 in the @entity68			2
but its most famous resident was @entity71			1
in 1837 , a distraught @entity71 , then in his mid- 20s , rented the property following the death of his sister - in - law @entity74			1
airy : the modern kitchen is in a house full of historic features at the time of his stay , @entity71 was writing his first two major novels , @entity82 and @entity81			1
they were written in instalments , because they were serialised in literary magazines			0
as he was working to tight deadlines , @entity71 needed a secluded place to work , and he knew the area offered this because he had stayed there in his childhood when his father was trying to evade creditors			1
the house , which has two staircases , has plenty of features to remind you how it would have looked when @entity71 was writing – vaulted ceilings , panelled walls and exposed beams			1
famous residents : @entity71 and romantic painter @entity56 lived in the house but it has been updated sufficiently to provide a slick , modern environment			1
there ’s a vast kitchen - dining area with an island workstation and a beautifully presented en suite bathroom and dressing room for the master bedroom			1
outside there are three sections of garden , each offering excellent entertainment space in the summer			0
@entity29 ’s current owner , @entity120 , is selling because she and her husband plan to live abroad			0
she says the artistic tradition of the house has lived on			0
‘ painters , musicians , actors , designers have continued to stay , ’ she says			0
indeed @entity120 has recently rented out the house to a family with a strong connection to the arts			0
her tenants , businessman @entity134 , 54 , and teacher wife @entity135 , 53 , have seen their 21 - year - old daughter , a film - maker , and 23 - year - old son , an artist , develop their careers while living there			0
the three outbuildings have helped			0
the @entity144 ’ son has used one as a studio			0
architect and poet : sir @entity149 who designed the suburb and romantic writer @entity63 meanwhile their daughter drew inspiration from the filming of the recent @entity7 film about slavery – @entity157 – up the road at @entity159			1
@entity135 says : ‘ we have loved the house ’s unique sense of history , and it ’s magical living on the edge of the @entity45			0
’ @entity166 , of estate agents @entity168 , says : ‘ there ’s been a great deal of interest			0
it is the first time the house has been on sale for 34 years , it has direct access to the @entity45 and is a gem of a property with a unique story			0
