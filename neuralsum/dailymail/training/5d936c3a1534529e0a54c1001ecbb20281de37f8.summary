by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 09:26 est , 23 august 2013 a pair of procrastinators have come up with a shocking way to tackle their @entity5 habits - a keyboard device that electrocutes them when they spend too long on the site			1
the @entity10 gadget sits under the wrist of a computer user and monitors which sites and applications are used			1
if the user is meant to be working , but keeps getting distracted by @entity5 , for example , or spends too long chatting on forums , the device sends an electric shock			1
it was created by doctorates from the @entity31 who wanted to reduce the amount of time they spent on sites such as @entity5 and @entity37 @entity10 is made of an @entity39 board - a board that can be used to develop applications and service - that sits under the wrist of a user			1
the board is connected to a computer by @entity47			2
users must install application logging software that is designed to monitor and track which programs and sites are used			1
the device connects to this software - the developers use the @entity59 @entity58 ui inspector - and tracks usage			1
if the users spend too long on a site , a warning message will appear on the screen			0
if they continue to use it , the board will electrocute them			0
it was developed by @entity68 students @entity69 and @entity70 at the @entity31			1
a video explaining the concept of the device claimed the pair ' wasted 50 hours a week procrastinating online ' and they needed a way of tackling this			1
@entity10 uses what @entity70 calls ' counter-conditioning ' techniques			1
it was named after @entity82 , famous for developing the theory of conditioning in dogs to make them behave a certain way			0
according to the video , the shock is unpleasant but it â€™s not dangerous			0
@entity10 is an @entity39 board - a board that can be used to develop applications and services - that sits under the wrist of a user			1
the board is then connected to a computer by @entity47			0
users must install application logging software designed to monitor and track which programs and sites are used			1
the @entity103 device can then connect to this software and tracks usage			2
if the users spend too long on a site , a warning message will appear on the screen			0
if they continue to use it , the board will electrocute them			0
a @entity113 study found that 70 per cent of people access @entity5 as soon as the log onto their pcs , while 85 per cent admitted to using the site daily			2
a quarter of people asked said they felt ' ill ' if they did n't log on every day			2
the device connects to application logging software and tracks usage			2
if the users spend too long on a site , such as @entity5 , a warning message will appear on the screen			0
if they continue to use it , the board will electrocute them research from the @entity132 added that @entity5 and @entity37 are ' more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol			0
' @entity69 and @entity70 claim on their site : ' while this project is intended to be a joke , we believe a serious discussion is needed about how communication technologies are designed			0
technologies like @entity5 are addictive by design			0
according to @entity145 , @entity5 users spend an average of 400 minutes per month on the site			0
' there is also a phone version that involves a stranger calling the user , rather than an electric shock , and shouting at them for their internet use			2
@entity69 and @entity70 have created the @entity10 as a prototype and have no plans to sell it .			1

@entity10 is a keyboard accessory that gives people electric shocks
it monitors sites and sends shocks to people who are procrastinating
device was developed by students to help tackle their addiction
