@entity1 is to unveil plans for a £ 260million system that will dispense drugs electronically and , he says , prevent needless deaths			1
at least 11 people died in the @entity14 last year because they were given the wrong drugs or incorrect doses			1
medicines are being prescribed incorrectly because patients ’ notes are lost , while research suggests that eight per cent of hospital prescriptions have mistakes in them			2
mr @entity1 will announce that he is accepting a key recommendation of the @entity26 report into the scandal at @entity28 , in which hundreds of patients are thought to have died needlessly , for better use of technology to improve care			2
the fund will first be used by hospitals to replace paper - based systems for patient notes and prescriptions , a key step towards an entirely digital @entity14 by 2018			1
eventually it will be rolled out to @entity40 ’ surgeries , marking an end to the written prescription			1
it will be primarily used for ‘ electronic prescribing ’ in which computer - generated prescriptions , using barcodes unique to each patient , are sent by doctors directly to pharmacies			2
government advisers say the technology will greatly reduce the scope for errors – such as poor handwriting – and improve safety			0
the new system of electronic records will protect patients , mr @entity1 will say , by also ensuring that doctors and nurses are able to access accurate details about the care of a patient wherever they are being treated			0
‘ this fund will allow doctors and nurses to make the @entity14 safer by harnessing the very latest technology , ’ he will add			0
at least 11 people died in the @entity14 last year because they were given the wrong drugs or incorrect doses ‘ in many places , right now , a paramedic picking up a frail elderly woman who has had a fall will not always know she has dementia , because he or she can not access her notes			1
' or a doctor is prescribing the wrong drugs , because they do n’t know what drugs their patient is already on			1
‘ if we are to improve patient safety then we must allow the @entity14 to have access to the best tools available and this fund will help them achieve that			0
’ professor sir @entity89 , medical director of @entity90 , said : ‘ this new fund will help patients get better and safer care by giving clinicians access to the right information when they need it most			0
‘ supporting hospitals to replace outdated paper systems for notes and prescriptions will help relieve patients ’ frustration at having to repeat their medical and medication history over and over again , often in the same hospital , because their records are n’t available			1
‘ expanding the use of electronic prescribing of medications in hospitals will help improve safety , save lives and save taxpayers ’ money			0
’ sir @entity89 , medical director of @entity90 , ( left ) said the new fund , announced by health secretary @entity1 ( right ) will give patients ' better and safer care ' @entity118 , national director for patients and information at @entity90 , said : ‘ we are delighted to be working with the @entity14 , @entity122 colleagues and frontline @entity14 staff to ensure that this fund enables the @entity14 to make substantial progress towards routine use of high - quality data at the point of care			1
‘ this step change in integrating diverse information sources around the needs to the patient will support clinicians and provider organisations deliver world class patient care			0
’ the government has already announced that by 2015 everyone who wants it will be able to get online access to their gp record			0
they will also be able to book appointments with their own doctor and order repeat prescriptions online			0
mr @entity1 announced last month that patients are to be given the right to opt out of a new @entity14 database logging details of drinking habits , waist sizes and family medical histories			2
following protests from privacy campaigners , people will be allowed to instruct their gps not to hand over their records to a centralised information bank			0
around 700,000 patients are thought to have opted out of an existing scheme allowing @entity40 to share information on their medical history with other parts of the @entity14 .			2

11 people given the wrong drugs or doses died in the @entity14 last year
@entity1 *'s* plans will see drugs dispensed electronically
hospitals will replace the paper - based systems for notes and prescriptions
will then be rolled out to @entity40 surgeries in aim for digital @entity14 by 2018
