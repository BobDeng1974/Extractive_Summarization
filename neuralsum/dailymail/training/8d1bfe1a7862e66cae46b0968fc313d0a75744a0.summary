the prime minister began his visit with the biggest business delegation in history by revealing that he stays sane by having a good night ’s sleep and employing good staff to do the work for him			1
he also claimed he would be watching @entity17 films on the flight out			0
the cricket - loving prime minister wielded the bat against some ferocious deliveries from local youngsters who flock to the recreation ground in the centre of the city to play			1
after a few lusty blows , mr @entity2 ’s middle stump was removed by a young bowler named @entity45 - named after mr @entity2 ’s own cricketing hero @entity45 , the legendary cricketer who once gave mr @entity2 a signed bat			2
mr @entity2 ’s technique won approving comments from members of the @entity52 women ’s squad , who have been helping train boys and girls through the @entity56 - backed @entity55 while in town for the @entity58			2
work and play : the @entity34 told an audience at the headquarters of @entity61 in @entity1 that he would be ' hopeless ' if he allowed himself to become ' exhausted and fried mentally ' by overwork ‘ he ’s got used the rough surface very quickly , ’ said former @entity52 captain @entity62 , adding ‘ that ’s a brilliant cover drive ’ , just before mr @entity2 almost got himself out			1
school boss @entity65 said : ‘ the pm was very chilled out , he was all smiles and very relaxed			0
‘ he said he had n’t had a hit for a long time but he got going and hit a few good cover drives			0
’ the prime minister ’s cricketing sojourn came just hours after he confessed he has no time for the workaholic habits of his predecessors @entity74 and @entity75			1
@entity74 famously survived on four hours a night during her premiership			0
yesterday : the prime minister also laid a wreath at the memorial to commemorate the policemen who were killed in the terrorist attacks of november 2008 , in @entity1 mr @entity2 called on @entity7 to further open up to foreign investment and said he wanted the two countries to have a ' special relationship ' but mr @entity2 told an audience at the headquarters of @entity61 in @entity1 that he would be ' hopeless ' if he allowed himself to become ' exhausted and fried mentally ' by overwork			1
asked how he copes with the job , mr @entity2 said : ‘ in terms of how i try to keep body and soul together , i try to stay a little bit fit			0
‘ so i try to go for a run a week , i try to play a game of tennis every week and i try not to go to bed too late			1
‘ like all these things , that does n’t always work , but the most important thing is to have a very good team around you to make sure you can delegate and have a team you can work with and get things done for you			1
’ @entity2 arrived in @entity7 with what he called @entity105 's biggest ever overseas business delegation for a three - day visit prime minister @entity2 paid his respects to the policemen who were killed in the terrorist attacks of november 2008 @entity2 announced the new visa service and relaxed immigration riles as he speaks n @entity1 , @entity7 @entity2 launched an attack on ' aggressive ' tax avoidance today			1
the prime minister said the government wanted to keep business taxes low so long as businesses paid their fair share			1
but he said it would be ' difficult ' for new laws to force companies to pay their taxes			0
mr @entity2 has made transparency over tax a key priority of @entity105 's presidency of the @entity128 group of world economic powers this year , after a series of controversies over the arrangements of huge companies which were shown to be paying little tax in the @entity105			1
he told an audience at the @entity61 headquarters in @entity1 that the government are cutting the rate of corporation tax on company profits down to 21 per cent			0
he said : ' the message to business should be , " if we are cutting this rate of tax down to a good low level , you should be paying that rate of tax , rather than seeking ever more aggressive ways to avoid it "			0
' ' i think the problem with that is that there are some forms of tax avoidance that have become so aggressive that there are moral questions that we have to answer about whether we want to encourage or allow that sort of behaviour			0
' ' some would say , " just change the law to make aggressive avoidance illegal " , but , with respect to my friends in the accountancy profession , it is difficult to do that			0
' he added : ‘ if you are exhausted and if you are fried mentally , you will be a hopeless prime minister			1
‘ you have to try to keep a good equilibrium and balance and then hopefully you can make good decisions			0
’ the pm was embarrassed by a recent biography which quoted a friend saying : ‘ if there was an olympic gold medal for chillaxing , @entity175 would win it			0
’ mr @entity2 also faced embarrassment at @entity61 when he failed to name a single one of the multinational company ’s products - which include @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 - when asked which ones he buys			0
attempting to be diplomatic , the @entity34 said : ‘ we have very similar brands in the @entity105			2
i do n’t want to start a flurry of excitement by saying i use @entity191 soap or whatever it is			0
' i might get some of your brands wrong and mention a dishwasher liquid we use and find out it ’s made by your competitor			0
' so , i ’m going to do that thing politicians always do when they get a really tough one - and dodge the question			0
’ the prime minister also unveiled plans to offer @entity7 a ‘ same - day ’ visa service so that business people can travel to the @entity105 more easily			1
the move comes in response to unhappiness with the current system – it can take three days or more to process applications			1
but it will provoke claims that the tough line mr @entity2 strikes at home on immigration is not matched when wooing foreigners to @entity105			2
he also said there was ‘ no limit ’ to the number of @entity7 who would be allowed to study at @entity105 universities and stay on in graduate - level jobs after they qualified			1
mr @entity2 said in @entity1 that his government had been forced to ‘ turn around an immigration system that was completely broken ’ by shutting down the ‘ bogus colleges ’ which thousands of migrants were using to enter the country			2
but now , he said , there would be ‘ no limit on the number ( of students ) that can come ’ from @entity7 to study at @entity105 ’s ‘ world class ’ universities			2
