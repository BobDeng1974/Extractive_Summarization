two @entity1 fighters which scrambled across @entity3 to intercept a foreign aircraft apparently warned the plane would be ' shot down ' , after it sparked a terror alert by taking an unscheduled detour over @entity8			1
the @entity9 from @entity10 , @entity11 , flew to @entity12 , south east @entity13 , at supersonic speeds to dramatically halt the plane on its way to @entity18 airport after it ' caused concern ' to air traffic controllers			1
the swoop , which resulted in the @entity23 - registered plane being grounded at @entity17 , sparked a massive sonic boom which was heard across a 50 - mile radius			1
soon after the incident , chilling audio emerged appearing to show one of the @entity1 pilots warning the three - man crew on board the foreign plane to listen to military instructions or risk being ' shot down '			1
scroll down for audio and video a @entity37 made @entity38 ( pictured ) was escorted into @entity17 while flying over @entity8 after ' causing concern ' to @entity3 air traffic controllers this afternoon an aviation expert said controllers ' probably knew ' what the aircraft was - but that nobody would be prepared to take any chances incase it was ' another 9/11 on the @entity48 '			1
in the audio footage - which has not been verified - a man is heard saying : ' i ’m instructed by @entity52 to warn you if you do not respond you will be shot down ’			1
the sound clip - which claims to be the voice of a pilot from one of the @entity1 pilots - was published on social media by @entity60 user @ @entity61 , an account which is not officially connected to the airbase			1
the @entity64 refused to comment on whether or not the clip was legitimate			1
the drama unfolded after the flight , which took off from @entity68 this morning , took an unprecedented detour when it approached @entity8			2
flight mapping experts said it flew towards the centre of the capital , prompting the fighter jets to be launched from the airbase 160 miles away			2
the planes were part of the @entity79 system , which is designed to respond to ' aviation security incidents '			0
aviation expert @entity81 , the @entity82 at @entity83 , said such incidents only happen in a ' minute ' proportion of flights but trigger a dramatic response because of the possibility of a terror - related incident			1
he said it was now confirmed that the aircraft had dialled into the wrong frequency when trying to contact @entity3 airspace			0
but nobody would have wanted to take any chances at the time , he said			0
he told @entity97 : ' they probably know who is in the airspace , but nobody is going to take any chances			0
' in these instances , it 's most likely that the wrong frequency has been dialled into - which happened in this case - but there is another possibility ; the possibility that there is a hijacker hiding down the back of the plane , who has decided : " i am going to do another 9/11 on the @entity113 "			2
' the @entity1 was reacting against this threat , which is normal when an ordinary flight with a flight plan suddenly goes incommunicado and they do n't know why			2
the flight , pictured grounded at the airport , was on its way to @entity18 airport when it was intercepted ' they have to assume the worst - especially if its did end up heading towards @entity124 or @entity48			2
' he added : ' the @entity1 is certainly not going to wittingly shoot down the flight with passengers unless convinced they would die in a terrorist attack			2
' a @entity17 spokesman confirmed the aircraft had lost communications with air traffic controllers , leading to the interception over @entity134 , @entity12			1
the aircraft - a @entity37 made @entity137 cargo airliner - was deemed safe by officials after it was checked			1
it is due to continue its flight to @entity18 later this evening			0
the @entity143 company @entity142 , which operated the plane , said the plane had been on a routine flight when the pilots lost communication with air traffic control when it arrived in @entity3 airspace			1
the plane , which was carrying automotive equipment , had taken off at 11am from @entity153 in @entity68 , before landing in @entity154 in @entity155 and then continuing its journey to the @entity3			0
this shows the flight path of the plane , which appeared to take a dramatic detour as it crossed @entity8 two @entity162 jets were deployed from @entity10 , @entity11 ( file pic ) after fears were sparked the spokesman said it was ' probably some kind of malfunction or some emergency situation '			1
this afternoon 's incident triggered a huge explosion - like sound , which stretched across @entity12 , @entity172 and as far away as @entity173 and @entity174			1
after the incident , the @entity1 tweeted : ' apologies if we startled you during the successful intercept this afternoon - we only go supersonic over land when absolutely necessary			1
' @entity60 users from as far away as @entity182 on the south coast and @entity184 , in neighbouring @entity172 , tweeted about hearing the huge noise and windows shaking			0
@entity187 tweeted : ' @entity190 - massive explosion - like noise heard down here in @entity134			2
can see people saying they heard it across @entity12			2
' @entity196 wrote : ' huge bang shook the house , no idea what that was			0
anyone else hear / feel it ? ' @entity203 added : ' who else felt the earth move and huge explosion in @entity12 5 minutes ago ? is the world coming to an end ? my house rocked			2
' two @entity1 fighters triggered a massive sonic boom across @entity12 this afternoon when they intercepted a foreign aircraft			1
pictured : @entity17 an @entity1 spokesman said : ' @entity162 aircraft were launched this afternoon from @entity10 to intercept a civilian aircraft south of @entity8 which was causing concern to air traffic control authorities			1
' the aircraft was safely escorted to @entity17			0
to fulfill their quick reaction role the @entity9 were cleared to travel at supersonic speed , any noise disturbance as a result of this is regretted			0
@entity226 now have the lead			0
' the spokesman added that the jets were on their way back to @entity10 around ten minutes later			0
@entity17 confirmed that the jets accompanied the plane to their airport , but have not revealed why			0
@entity234 confirmed the noise was created by @entity1 activity			0
a spokesman for @entity226 said : ' military jets were deployed on a precautionary basis when a @entity143 registered cargo plane was diverted to @entity17			1
' this was due to a loss of communication with the aircraft			0
the aircraft landed safely at @entity17 at around 5.20pm			0
' all three people who were on board have been spoken to by police , it was established that everything was in order and reason for the short loss of communication was due to a change in airspace jurisdiction			2
' @entity226 is not investigating the incident and the aircraft will be able to continue its journey to @entity18 when it is ready			0
' according to the company 's website , @entity1 - @entity261 , which was set up in 1990 , transports ' all kinds of dangerous goods ' , including radioactive materials			0
a sonic boom is the sound associated with the shockwaves created when an object , such as an aircraft , breaks the sound barrier			1
in april , 2012 , a massive sonic boom was heard across five counties from @entity275 to @entity276 after two fighter jets were scrambled to help a helicopter , after its pilot accidentally emitted an emergency signal			1
@entity283 @entity282 @entity162 jets scrambled to intercept seven @entity37 @entity282 planes flying in international airspace over the @entity286			0
the jets were put on @entity79 yesterday at @entity288 , @entity289 as they supported @entity290 in intercepting the fleet			0
according to the @entity293 , the package represents one of the largest fleets intercepted by @entity290 fighter planes in the past few years .			0
