when @entity1 , five times a major winner , begins checking his green maps standing over a three foot putt , it is fair to assume he is feeling a little tense			1
even on the first morning of the first day , the @entity5 can do that to a guy			1
even a cool guy like @entity1			1
he stayed calm enough to drop it , though			0
and as it fell , @entity11 's marquee pairing went down the hole with it			0
@entity14 and @entity15 , the world number one and number three , had no way back from there			1
@entity1 saved his best for last , his birdie on the 18th giving @entity22 an unassailable and perfectly timed lead in the friday session			1
to be fair , it probably did n't need to be @entity1 's absolute best			1
the @entity27 did n't play well enough to provoke that			0
@entity1 made his four via a bunker , but so abject was the performance of the @entity27 pair on the final hole that this was still plenty good enough			1
@entity14 and @entity1 watch on during their fourballs encounter on friday morning @entity14 did n't enjoy his best morning on the first day of the @entity5 at @entity36 the world no 1 was unusually insipid when the @entity27 team were looking to him to lead from the front @entity40 saves point neither @entity14 nor @entity15 made the green of @entity36 ultimate par five in the regulation three shots			1
at one stage @entity15 chipped from rough straight into a bunker			1
@entity14 was barely in contention , either			1
he had a dreadful first round , with the @entity27 team looking to him to set the standard			0
it was a close game , but one that @entity27 certainly could have won			0
if @entity14 had delivered even an approximation of the game that has taken him to the pinnacle of golf 's rankings , it would have been too much for the opposing pair			1
instead , he was insipid , @entity15 inconsistent , and @entity22 cleaned up at the death			1
@entity27 led by a hole coming away from the 15th , but @entity62 eagled the 16th and @entity1 won the last to give @entity27 captain @entity11 plenty to consider at the turnaround			1
in @entity67 , last time out , 12 of the 28 matches went to the last hole , and @entity27 collected nine and a half points from those games			0
here , two went the distance in the morning and @entity27 gleaned half a point			0
to see @entity14 and @entity15 fall so dramatically was a particularly crushing blow			1
' @entity74 and break him , ' was the instruction of @entity76 , the last @entity22 captain to win the @entity5			1
what impact this defeat was going to have remained to be seen , but it was certainly a positive start for @entity80 's stars and stripes			0
having got their noses in front late , nobody expected to see @entity27 's strongest pair crumble so spectacularly			2
@entity1 shakes the hands of @entity27 's @entity87 after beating the pair @entity15 ( left ) and @entity14 leave the 18th green dejected after surrendering a point the @entity22 @entity62 celebrates with a victory punch after winning the 16th hole not that @entity1 and @entity62 are inferiors as a unit			1
at the end of the morning session , they were on the best run of any @entity22 duo at a @entity5 since @entity100 and @entity101 in 1979			1
yet the golf played did not have to be that of a great partnership			0
indeed , anyone expecting a masterclass from players of such pedigree would have left this corner of @entity110 sorely disappointed			0
far from an exhibition , this was something altogether earthier			0
a scrap , a dust - up , a bundle in the playground			0
the match fluctuated because the performances fluctuated , and wildly			0
@entity14 played the first home like the world number one , and the second like a club handicapper			2
find @entity14 , as @entity76 suggested ? it would have been hard because he spent so much time in unfamiliar surroundings : off to the left in heavy rough , short in greenside bunkers			2
nerves make the @entity5 special , but this better resembled a monthly medal , particularly on the long holes that professionals relish			2
the @entity132 coming up against @entity1 was the blockbuster match - up of the opening day the hole is a par five , but not one of the quartet took a shot off it			1
the tone had been set even earlier			0
' on the tee , @entity62 , ' said the official starter on the first			2
the resulting was fired a long way left			0
' on the 18th tee , @entity62 , ' said a jocular soul in the crowd			2
@entity62 – identified by @entity27 's rabble rouser @entity148 as a kindred spirit in the opposing ranks – rode a lot of comments like that			2
' want tea with that slice ? ' crowed a voice on the fourth , as another tee shot set off along a wayward path			0
by the sixth – and a hole down after @entity15 had chipped in from a bunker on four – even the genial @entity1 was getting tetchy			1
he snapped at a small party of television cameramen , who had taken a wrong turn and almost knocked him over as they tried frantically to retrace their steps along the fairway			0
on the eighth there was a row over whether @entity62 should get relief from a lousy lie			2
' is there some new rule i do n't know about ? ' asked @entity1 , tartly			2
@entity62 's caddie , @entity177 , was also distinctly unamused			2
then again , he spent much of the morning at war with the world			0
spectators , rogue cameramen , shadows , everything seemed to be getting on his wick			0
@entity62 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity15 with both @entity1 and @entity14 watching on what was getting on @entity14 's wick was his game			1
it would n't come when he called it			0
he made precious few interventions worthy of his reputation			0
@entity14 won the 13th and 15th holes , to take the game from two down to all square , but on both occasions with straightforward pars to @entity22 bogeys			1
meanwhile , with all the players struggling to find form , there was n't even the predicted needle			0
in the phoney war that always precedes this event , @entity1 had made a jibe about the legal battle beteen @entity14 and @entity208 's management company			1
would @entity14 give him the cold shoulder ? hardly			2
on the short buggy ride up to the ninth tee , the pair shared a buggy and @entity1 put his arm around the shoulders of his young rival , laughing			1
they were both probably in need of consolation at that point			0
by the end , however , @entity14 was left to fend for himself .			0

the @entity5 is *underway* on the @entity223 at @entity36
@entity1 and @entity62 claim victory on the last against @entity14 and @entity15 to put @entity22 *2.5* - *1.5* up
the @entity132 was expected to lead from the front on the first day
