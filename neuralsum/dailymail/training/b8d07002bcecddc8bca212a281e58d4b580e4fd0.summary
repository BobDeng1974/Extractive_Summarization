pull on the white shirt for the @entity1 at a major finals and get international experience of competing for a trophy ? or take a holiday and return in time for a shirt - selling operation in the @entity8 or the @entity9 ? we all know the answer			1
will @entity12 give his blessing for @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and others to join up with @entity19 's junior team at the end of this season , or focus on his team - sheet for the next money - spinning global tour ? @entity25 will no doubt take @entity26 to glad - hand their @entity28 - based owners some time before the start of next season and would rather have @entity31 along to show his dazzling smile			1
@entity31 , pictured in action against @entity34 , is eligible to play for @entity19 under 21s next summer @entity35 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) are two more senior players who still qualify for the @entity1 21s @entity37 has led his @entity19 under 21 side to the @entity39 in the @entity40 @entity16 has moved quickly into @entity42 's senior @entity19 squad after signing for @entity43 @entity44 will insist on some rest for @entity35 ( currently resting while injured ) and @entity46 ( currently resting while injured ) , @entity47 will need a break from helping @entity49 defend while most of his team - mates attack and the rest will find something better to do			1
like the talented @entity53 , who has made it clear that under 21 football is not for him			0
speak to senior figures at the @entity58 and they will tell you that agents do not want their clients ' stepping back ' into the @entity1 for fear of damaging their brand in the money - dash world that is the @entity65			1
under 21 football has long been the place to avoid and the caps nobody wants			0
@entity37 has set about changing those attitudes and @entity70 's performances in the last two games suggest he is making progress			1
@entity70 limped off in his previous game for @entity49 but declared himself fit for duty			2
the senior team , however , still robbed @entity76 , promoting him for matches against @entity34 and @entity78 — and that sent out the wrong message			0
@entity70 ( left ) was in @entity19 's @entity82 squad but went into the @entity1 to face @entity83 twice @entity84 line up ahead of their 2 - 1 second leg play - off win against @entity83 in @entity87 a look at the team fielded against @entity83 on tuesday ( right ) and a possible starting xi for next summer ( left ) @entity93 's @entity92 ( right ) impressed during the @entity95 ' second leg victory in @entity83 players born on or after january 1 , 1992 are eligible to participate in the 2015 @entity97			1
this means that some players - such as @entity14 - will be 23 by the time of the tournament			2
yet these players are allowed to play because they were aged 21 or under when the qualification process began			2
@entity37 is a sensible , intelligent football man			2
he has guided the under 21 team into the @entity39 finals , where they lost all three games last time			2
now they have won 10 games in succession , with players who are not regulars with their clubs , and won their play - off with home and away 2 - 1 wins against a threatening @entity83			1
he is not a coach who wants to add to @entity42 's problems and will take what he is given			0
he also believes in the unity of the group who have taken @entity19 this far and does n't want ' outsiders '			2
but he should still have the chance to pick the best team he can			0
the seniors are strolling through a pathetically weak qualifying group that is doing nothing to arrest dwindling interest in the national team			0
imagine if a strong under 21 team won their first trophy since 1984 ? holders @entity133 are out , so are @entity134			0
there are still dangerous opponents , but this might help to reverse a trend of suffocating failure			0
this might be the breakthrough we have been looking for			0
many of @entity42 's young @entity19 squad would benefit from competitive internationals next summer @entity46 ( left ) and @entity15 could be part of an extremely strong @entity19 under 21 xi @entity148 's @entity53 was reluctant to go back to the @entity1 after tasting senior action for @entity19 the squad would become familiar with the pressures of tournament football before the senior @entity39 in @entity153 the following summer , when others such as @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 would be along to boost the average age			1
with the next two @entity160 at venues unlikely to suit the @entity163 travel sickness , the next euros in @entity153 are the biggest chance of progress			0
why not look to start the winning habit now ? burn - out needs to be given thought , but few of the players we are talking about will go the distance with their clubs			1
@entity35 , for instance , is carefully managed by @entity174			0
@entity15 is not an @entity43 regular , @entity70 and @entity176 must still impress their club managers , despite costing a combined £ 40million - plus			1
it would be a terrible shame if an opportunity of success was lost because the selfish heavyweight @entity65 clubs come out on top again			1
this is @entity19 's time .			0

some @entity19 players have shown a reluctance to play for the @entity1 21s
but @entity37 must have his best players available next summer
the @entity19 secured their place at the @entity39 with a 4 - 2 aggregate play - off win against @entity83
@entity70 *dropped* down from the senior squad to start both legs
@entity65 clubs want their players *refreshed* for the next campaign
however , @entity19 have a chance to win in the @entity40 in 2015
