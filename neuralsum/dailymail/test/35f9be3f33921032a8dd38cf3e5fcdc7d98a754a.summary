the grandmother - of - four said : ' i was with a friend helping her reverse out of a car park , and there was this wooden pallet in the way			1
' i moved the pallet out of the way with my foot and i was going to turn around to my friend say " is that far enough ? "			1
' i took a step over - never in my life did i think there was a hole underneath , i thought it had just fallen over			1
the next thing i remember is the pain			2
' i fell and smashed my face on the pallet , and i was in the hole with blood all over me and i could n't move			1
' she reckons she has been set back ' years ' in her battle with the debilitating condition , which has left her housebound for a decade , and fears she 'll never leave her home again			1
miss @entity0 , who lives in @entity10 , said : ' it 's hard for me to go anywhere , but i was getting better			1
now i 'm not so sure			2
' she spent nearly an hour waiting in agony on the forecourt of @entity62 on friday , april 10 , before a paramedic arrived to take her to @entity65 hospital			2

' it 's ruined my mother 's recovery			0
i ca n't believe it			0
whoever owns that manhole has something serious to answer for			0
miss @entity0 was trying to move a wooden pallet when she fell down the gap , smashing her face and trapping her leg on the way down			1
she 's been left with two black eyes and bruising ' i 'm self - employed , and i have to take time off work to care for my disabled mum , who has been knocked for six by negligence			1
' if she was smaller she would have gone all of the way down - a slender woman or child could have been very seriously hurt			1
' an employee at the company , where @entity96 's friend had driven her to get a new tyre for her car , claimed the holes have been reported ' loads of times ' to the owner of the site			2
the manhole ( pictured ) at @entity62 in @entity10 had been covered by a wooden pallet the site is leased from the owner of @entity108 , which sells safety clothing to the construction industry in the neighbouring unit			1
a spokesman for @entity113 confirmed its attendance and explained why it took so long for an ambulance to arrive			0
he said : ' when the call came in , with the information provided by the caller , it was classified as a " class c " call			0
' we always do our best to back up the first paramedic as soon as we can but life - threatening calls have to take priority			1
' neither the tyre shop or their landlord @entity108 are accepting responsibility for fixing the broken manhole			0
a worker at the garage said : ' we have been trying to get the manholes in the forecourt fixed for years , but what 's happened is they were covered with pallets			0
' the building owner , who also runs nearby business @entity137 , said : ' they are the tenants , so it 's down to them to fix the manhole cover			0
' i 'm the landlord , but they have not spoken to me about it			0
' agoraphobia is ' a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult , or help would n't be available if things went wrong ' , according to the @entity152 website			2
the site explains that though it 's often thought that the condition is a fear of open spaces the reality is not quite as straightforward , with some sufferers also fearing public transport and shopping centres			0
when agoraphobics are exposed to their fears several symptoms can sweep over them , including a feeling of nausea , rapid heartbeat and breathing , and rising temperature			0
the cause of agoraphobia can vary from person to person , with some people developing a fear of a certain situation or place because they experienced a panic attack there and then try to avoid it			2
others may develop the condition through a fear of crime or being involved in an accident			0
treatments may involve counselling , relaxation training or taking antidepressants			0
@entity189 says : ' in the @entity191 , up to two people in 100 have a panic disorder and it is thought around a third of those will go on to develop agoraphobia as a result			2
