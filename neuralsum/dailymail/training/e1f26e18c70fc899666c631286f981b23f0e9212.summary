' a glass of red wine contains high amounts of natural polyphenols or antioxidants which not only help our cells fight against free radical damage but also increase our levels of ' good ' cholesterol			2
' it also contains procyanidins which help reduce blood pressure and protect against hardening of the arteries			0
studies have shown that red wine may boost brain power too , especially for older women , although the jury ’s out as to whether this benefit comes solely from wine or includes other alcohol			2
' do n’t forget , it ’s only a glass or two that may keep the doctor away , not a whole bottle ! ' if you ’re in need of a little seasonal cheer , why not enjoy a glass of delicious mulled wine			2
adding spices such as cinnamon , cloves and star anise also boosts our antioxidant levels			1

add just enough water or a little wine to cover the sugar , then simmer gently until the sugar has dissolved			0
bring to boil for a few minutes to infuse the spices until you have a sticky syrup			0
