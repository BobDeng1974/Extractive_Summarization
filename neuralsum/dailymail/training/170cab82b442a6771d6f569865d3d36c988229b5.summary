by @entity0 published : 08:36 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 09:55 est , 4 march 2014 a @entity3 man has become the second patient in a @entity5 to have pioneering stem cell treatment in a bid to prolong his life			0
@entity9 , 71 , was invited to take part in the landmark trial after suffering a major heart attack at home			1
cardiologists repaired a blocked artery and inserted a stent to keep it open after he was rushed to hospital			1
@entity9 ( pictured with his wife , @entity18 ) has become the second person in @entity5 to have pioneering stem cell treatment after a heart attack			1
it is hoped the procedure will cause his damaged heart muscle to regenerate and that it could eventually become common practice in the treatment of heart attack patients but while recovering in hospital , he was asked to take part in the major new study to see if heart attack patients can benefit from being treated with their own stem cells			1
these are ' master cells ' which can turn into almost any other type of cell in the body , replacing damaged cells			1
doctors at the @entity39 , in @entity37 , removed bone marrow from mr @entity9 , a grandfather , without general anaesthetic and the cells were then infused into his heart			1
mr @entity9 , a chauffeur , had bone marrow extracted from his hip before it was ' purified ' in a stem cell laboratory			1
this allowed the stem cells to be separated from the serum also found in bone marrow			1
he then had the stem cells injected into his major coronary arteries from where they infused into his heart muscle			1
it is hoped this will help his damaged heart muscle regenerate			1
mr @entity9 was treated at the @entity39 ( pictured ) and will continue to receive check - ups for five years as doctors study the effect of the stem cell treatment he will now continue to have check - ups for five years in a bid to see how the treatment affects the health of his heart			1
he told @entity64 : ' when i heard about the trial i thought it was a good idea			0
it was explained to me and i could see where they were coming from , so i hoped some good would come of it			0
at least they 've tried			0
' i thought : nothing ventured , nothing gained			0
' he added : ' i feel fantastic in myself			0
most people would n't believe i 've had a heart attack			2
i think i 've been very lucky and i hope the procedure does what they are hoping it will do			0
' within a few days of receiving the stem cells , mr @entity9 had recovered from the procedure and was able to leave hospital			1
mr @entity9 had some of his own bone marrow harvested from his hip			1
the stem cells were then removed from the bone marrow in a specialist lab. the stem cells were then injected into his coronary arteries from where they infused into his heart muscle			1
it is hoped this will cause the damaged heart muscle to regenerate			2
stem cells are the body ’s master cells which can turn into almost any other type of cell in the body , replacing damaged cells			1
using the patient 's own stem cells means the chance of them being rejected is much lower			2
mr @entity9 will have check - ups for five years and his progress will be compared to that of other heart attack patients			2
if the procedure prove to be successful , it could become standard practice in the treatment of heart attack patients			2
mr @entity9 's progress will now be monitored and compared with that of other heart attack victims who have not had the treatment			2
medical experts hope that , by using his own stem cells , the risk of rejection is greatly reduced and it will speed his recovery			2
it is hoped the treatment will increase survival rates among heart patients by at least 25 per cent if carried out within five days of a heart attack			2
the 5.9 million euro trial is taking place in @entity3 and nine other @entity5 countries and is funded by the @entity135			0
mr @entity9 , from @entity136 , @entity137 , said he had been told by doctors that he was a perfect candidate for the research as only 45 per cent of his heart was working			0
mr @entity9 , who is married to @entity18 , 67 , said : ‘ my hope is that the cells will regenerate and give me ability and a normal life cycle			2
‘ i feel damn lucky - the stem cell surgery could not have happened at a better time			0
‘ i am grateful to be part of a pioneering programme			0
’ he added : ' i think this is the way of the future - i am happy to be in on it			0
the trial is being carried out by @entity154 , which runs the @entity39 , in conjunction with @entity156 and @entity157			0
altogether 3,000 patients across @entity5 will be taking part in the pilot scheme			0
consultant cardiologist professor @entity161 said : ‘ the study is the biggest and most comprehensive trial of its kind in the world and follows successful trials , funded by @entity167			0
mr @entity9 told @entity64 that he was very happy to take part in the trial in the hope it will help future patients			0
he said it was ' no skin off my nose ' but that it could lead to real benefits ‘ it has taken two years to get to the point where we are ready to accept patients , but we have now reached that stage and we are all very excited			0
‘ our studies will tell us if adult stem cells from bone marrow can repair damaged hearts and , if so , how these cells should be administered to patients			1
‘ stem cells are the body ’s master cells which can turn into almost any other type of cell in the body , replacing damaged cells			1
' this study will determine if adult stem cells can save lives in heart attack patients across @entity5			1
' professor @entity198 , from @entity157 , added : ' this trial brings together a powerful partnership of @entity5 doctors and scientists to solve a fundamental problem of importance to all people			0
' it will give an answer about whether adult multi-potential stem cells in their natural environment can treat human disease			0

@entity9 , 71 , suffered a major heart attack at home
had surgery to repair a blocked artery and to insert a stent to keep it open
he was then asked to take part in a new study into the use of stem cells
these are ' master cells ' which can turn into almost any other type of cell in the body , replacing damaged cells
he had bone marrow removed from his hip and infused into his heart
it is hoped this will regenerate to help heal his damaged heart
