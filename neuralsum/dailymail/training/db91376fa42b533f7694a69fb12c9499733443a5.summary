one in 10 @entity2 homeowners face spending hundreds of pounds every few years on property valuations because of @entity5 ’s plan to introduce a ‘ @entity6 ’ , it has been revealed			1
the @entity8 leader has vowed to impose a levy of up to £ 15,000 - a - year on homes worth over £ 2million in order to shore up the @entity12			1
more than 100,000 homeowners could be hit immediately by the tax , which is expected to be a levy of 1 per cent			1
but thousands more families - the vast majority in @entity2 - could be forced to pay for valuations of their homes by surveyors because of @entity22 ’s volatile housing market which can see increases of over 20 per cent in a year			1
house prices are soaring by more than 10 per cent a year , which could drag more and more properties into the ' mansion tax ' band mr @entity5 says the tax will raise £ 1.3 billion , which will be used to hire thousands of @entity12 staff			1
but some 250,000 , just under one in 10 of households in the capital , will be forced bring in surveyors to assess whether their property exceeds £ 2million , according to experts at @entity37 estate agents			1
they will also face fines of thousands of pounds if the taxman disagrees with the valuation they submit			2
@entity8 has insisted it will not introduce a wholesale revaluation of properties to see how many multi-million pound properties are being bought and sold			2
instead , the party is considering a similar scheme to the one developed by @entity47 to target super-rich individuals who buy large houses through businesses , avoiding stamp duty			0
mr @entity47 ’s scheme means those who buy houses through companies have to report to the taxman what the house is worth , with those over £ 500,000 subject to a tax			2
a penalty of 30 per cent of the tax owed is imposed if the wrong amount is declared through ‘ carelessness ’ , rising to 100 per cent if it was deliberate			0
labour leader @entity5 said a mansion tax would raise almost £ 2 billion which would be used to hire tens of thousands of @entity12 staff but critics have raised concerned that thousands risk could be forced to pay the tax unfairly because estate agents are inflating the asking prices of homes			1
under mr @entity47 's scheme valuations must be undertaken every five years			2
a senior @entity8 source said shadow chancellor @entity74 was looking at using a ‘ similar model ’ to mr @entity47 ’s			0
yesterday it emerged pensioners hit by the levy could see the money taken out of their estates when they die			0
@entity8 peer @entity81 has criticised his party 's ' mansion tax ' proposal elderly homeowners who do not have the income to pay up front could defer the tax until their death			1
it would mean that their families could be faced with bills running to tens of thousands of pounds			0
only a tiny number of people are expected to be exempted from the tax which , it is feared , could hit the so - called ‘ asset - rich , cash - poor ’ homeowners who live in properties whose value has soared in recent years but do not have the ready money to pay the levy			1
@entity8 mp @entity102 , who represents @entity103 , told the @entity104 that one solution would be to offer ‘ relief ’ to some long - term residents or allow them to ‘ defer payments until the property was sold ’			2
a string of prominent @entity2 - based @entity112 have already come out against the levy – which they see as a ‘ tax on the capital ’			2
and @entity8 ’s candidates for @entity2 mayor have also opposed the measure , which would disproportionately affect @entity2			0
yesterday @entity81 criticised the proposal , saying : ‘ people whose houses have been inflated into much higher values and suddenly find themselves therefore facing a much higher tax bill , many of whom will not be people of means , we need to play fair by them too			0
’ @entity8 say the £ 2 million threshold will rise each year in line with house price inflation , and the level will be banded so the most expensive properties are levied the most			1
one estate agent said the policy would suppress the value of homes close to the £ 2 million threshold			0
the policy has alarmed mps in the capital			0
@entity143 , the @entity8 mp for @entity144 , said there was a " big question " around how houses would be valued			0
" if [ it is ] on current value , then @entity2 pensioners living in same home for years will be hit hard , " he said .			0

@entity8 vowed to impose levy of £ 15,000 - a - year on homes worth over £ 2m
more than 100,000 homeowners could be hit immediately by the tax
but around 250,000 property owners could be forced to pay for valuations
as house market booms owners face £ 500 valuation bill every few years
