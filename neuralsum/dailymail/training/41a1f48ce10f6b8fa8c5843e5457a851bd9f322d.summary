@entity0 plays the pantomime villain on @entity2 , but there is someone to whom he would never award anything less than a ten			1
the @entity9 judge confesses to being ' unbelievably in love ' with the @entity11 , rescued by his partner , @entity12 , five years ago			1
' i have never been broody for children , ' says mr @entity0 , ' so it comes as a complete surprise to find out how much i love her			1
' @entity0 ( pictured with dog @entity7 ) confesses to being ' unbelievably in love ' his the @entity11 and is heartbroken after she was diagnosed with a diseased heart sadly , that happy state of affairs may end soon			1
@entity7 shares a curse common to many @entity24 : a diseased heart			1
now , despite a regime involving eight tablets a day , @entity7 is unlikely to survive for very much longer			1
' i am so upset , ' says mr @entity0			1
' you know it 's imminent , but you have to take one day at a time and enjoy it			2
' @entity7 's condition highlights a serious issue — one that sheds light on modern attitudes to animal welfare			1
for centuries , mankind has been refining descendants of the wolf into ever - more - specialised breeds of dog			1
many of them are prey to some particular illness or other , but some varieties are so riddled with inherited defects that even breed enthusiasts are calling for action to combat the problem — either by mixing them with other breeds or by getting rid of them altogether			1
@entity7 shares a curse common to many @entity24 : @entity56 which is fatal for the animals and so it is with the @entity11			1
the breed is a longer - nosed version of the @entity61 and the result of an attempt in the 1920s to create a prettier dog from a small pool of ' founder ' animals			1
mild of temperament , the @entity11 is the pet of choice for many families , and last year some 5,100 puppies were registered with the @entity75 — the nearest thing to a regulator in the dog world			2
famous owners have included @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			2
but that cute little head masks a terrible problem			2
' i can not support the breeding of @entity24 and will , sadly , not be getting another , ' says @entity89 , a former owner			2
' i do n't believe human selfishness should mean that animals suffer			2
' cavaliers disproportionately suffer from two major defects			2
the first is @entity56 ( @entity56 ) , in which one of the valves controlling blood flow through the heart shrivels over time , reducing the amount of blood pumped into the body			2
affected dogs can end up struggling for breath , before finally dying of the disease			2
the second is a very distressing condition called @entity106 ( @entity107 )			2
put simply , this involves the brain being too big for the skull			2
as a result , the brain squeezes through the opening leading to the spinal cord , causing fluid in the spine to press on nerves , resulting in pain and disability			2
critics of the @entity11 breeding fraternity ascribe this suffering , in part at least , to the quest for a dog with a puppy - like appearance			1
' years of breeding for a prettier head has resulted in too small a skull , ' says @entity128 , a one - time @entity11 breeder			0
' seventy per cent of @entity24 will have gone on to develop @entity107 by the age of six			0
' but it is not just @entity11 which are prone to hereditary problems , @entity130 ( pictured ) are especially likely to develop obesity which leads to a collection of other health probelms she has witnessed the consequences at first hand			1
' my @entity140 was a top stud dog , and he started showing signs of @entity107 at the age of 11 , ' she says			0
' it got so bad that he ended up screaming with pain			0
it could n't be controlled and he had to be put down			0
' ms @entity89 endured a similar experience to mrs @entity128 with her first @entity11 , called @entity151			0
' @entity152 had to be put to sleep aged five as a result of unbearable pain , ' she says			0
' it broke my heart to know how much she 'd suffered during her short life , and how little i could do for her			0
' i foolishly got another @entity140 , @entity160 , only to find out through an mri scan that she , too , had sm. she fared better as a result of early surgery and drug treatment , but developed @entity56 and died aged 11			0
' mrs @entity128 was a leading light in the @entity166 until removed from her position as spokesman on health in 2008			0
her crime was to say in a @entity172 tv documentary that she had seen a scan confirming that a champion @entity140 , which had sired many litters , suffered from @entity107 dog breeding and showing are , she says , ' almost like a cult — a kind of brainwashing			0
people know that inbreeding is dangerous in humans , but somehow do n't see that it 's dangerous in animals			0
' there is a kind of code of silence that you do not talk about health problems in your breed , ' she adds			1
' it 's about status			0
it 's about not wanting to have to remove your best dog from the show ring or your breeding programme ; about puppy sales and stud fees ; it 's about prestige			1
' @entity24 ( left ) are also prone to @entity106 , a painful condition where the skull is simply too small for the skull , while the @entity208 ( right ) are prone to eye damage while their short faces gives them breathing difficulties today , mrs @entity128 and ms @entity89 are pressing for the @entity75 to refuse to register @entity11 puppies whose parents have not had mri scans on their skulls and tests on their heart			0
the @entity75 began a voluntary testing scheme in 2012 , but up to november 2014 only 200 owners had submitted their animals for inspection			1
mrs @entity128 says breeders avoid it because results are published , but the club claims that there is doubt about the effectiveness of screening in reducing @entity107 and @entity56			1
@entity230 , the @entity75 's health manager , says : ' we have no powers as such , except the power to encourage and educate			0
in terms of breeding to produce exaggerated features , we have tried to control this through the show ring , and we believe we are beginning to have some success			0
' one of the ways we deal with this is to put the health of the dog to the forefront in competition			0
' people supporting the campaign for mandatory mri scans and heart testing can add their names to an online petition on @entity252			1
mr @entity0 and his partner have now come out in support of mandatory testing for @entity24 before puppies can be registered			1
in his entry on the petition , the @entity2 judge writes : ' my partner , @entity261 , and i have a 13 - year - old @entity140 called @entity7			1
she is the most beautiful little girl			0
' but she has a lot of health issues that mean she 's on full - time medication			0
there needs to be a law put in place to make sure @entity24 are @entity269 - scanned and heart - tested before breeding			0
' in response to the criticism , breeders say they are being unfairly persecuted			1
@entity275 , chairman of the @entity166 , says her members love their dogs , and she denies that incestuous breeding is widespread			0
the @entity279 ( pictured like many large breeds , are prone to hip dysplasia which causes pain , arthritis , and problems walking mrs @entity275 , who has 29 @entity24 , two of them suffering from @entity107 , says : ' people who have done the campaigning have almost witch - hunted certain kennels and breeders			1
that has effectively driven people underground , away from scanning centres that publish the results of those scans			0
' even dogs whose mri tests give them a ' clear ' bill of health can still produce a problem puppy , she argues , and she does not believe that head shape is the issue			1
while acknowledging that @entity107 can cause ' dreadful ' pain , she questions whether the percentage of dogs that suffer such pain ' would even be recognisable '			0
' the @entity11 is one of the wussiest breeds , so if you comb its ears and catch a hair tangle it will scream , ' she says			1
@entity312 , a vet who has undertaken a study for the @entity314 on genetic conditions in dogs , is promoting more understanding of canine - inherited disease through the new @entity321 project , in which vets share the results of screening			0
he warns : ' if we want to keep the breed — and @entity24 are beautiful and adorable dogs — we have to breed away from it very gradually or we could end up introducing a new set of problems			1
' ultimately , he suggests the broader public 's attitudes to pedigree dogs may need to undergo a shift			0
' a lot of the decisions about how dogs look are not driven by the @entity75 , they are driven by the public , ' he says			0
' flavours of the month at the moment are @entity343 and @entity344 bulldogs			0
both can suffer from breathing problems because of their noses			1
' mrs @entity128 has now set up the @entity348 , and offers advice on how to reduce the risk of genetic disease			0
' i believe the only way to save the @entity11 is to out - cross it to another breed , ' she says			2
' but as far as breeders are concerned , the product would be a mongrel			2

@entity0 is devoted to @entity7
but she has now been diagnosed with a common but fatal breed complaint
even breeders admit certain breeds have become riddled with problems
the @entity9 judge is now backing calls for mandatory puppy testing
