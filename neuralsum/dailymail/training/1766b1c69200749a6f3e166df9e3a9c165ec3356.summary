' an old design for the skyscraper when its name was @entity40			2
permission has already been granted the tower will still be more than 200ft shorter than the @entity56 , the tallest skyscraper in western @entity9 the 794ft tower is the latest in a stream of luxury developments in the capital			1
one of the newest is the 594 - ft @entity62 in @entity63 , south @entity7 , which made headlines when a helicopter crashed into the crane used to build it , killing two people			0

' some of that stock justifies the price but we are worried that not all of it will '			0
