but the @entity8 has plans to blow the clouds away , with a service that will warn sufferers that bad weather is on the way			1
@entity2 is a type of winter depression that affects an estimated 7 per cent of the @entity18 population every winter between september and april , in particular during december , january and february			1
with the miserable weather set to be a daily feature for the next few months , the @entity19 is inventing ways to help sufferers beat the ' winter blues ' the @entity18 has been battered by bad weather this year , with rain lashing the country and storms causing chaos the national forecaster 's ' @entity31 ' scheme alerts @entity2 patients via email , voicemail or text , that the clouds are rolling in and that they should use light boxes to cheer themselves up			1
it combines miserable weather alerts issued by the @entity8 with light therapy and @entity42 ( @entity42 ) self - help material to help people			1
' light lounges ' can help beat the blues of those who struggle to survive the wintery months they said their scheme is a preventative service , aimed at helping people with @entity2 to manage their condition by warning them of periods of increased risk to their health and providing them with treatments to manage their condition			1
@entity31 was piloted in @entity57 from february to the end of april 2009			0
the @entity8 , @entity59 and the @entity57 and @entity60 worked together to provide the service			1
everyone enrolled on the service was provided with a light box and a self - help booklet that included some tried and tested self - help strategies			2
these ideas were based on @entity42 and provided common - sense approaches to managing the symptoms of winter depression			2
when gloomy weather was forecast , the @entity8 provided alerts to people enrolled on the scheme			1
participants chose to receive the alert either by email , text message or through an automated phone call			0
in a report of their findings , they wrote what a positive impact the service had on users			1
they wrote : ' overall , the findings of the pilot were extremely encouraging			2
the findings show that before the trial ( marked in green ) the majority of participants ' responses fell within the moderate - severe to severe category , but afterwards ( marked in blue ) participants fell better while some of us love the autumnal scenes , others dread the accompanying dark nights and harsh weather parts of the @entity18 , including @entity104 washlands in @entity105 , have been flooded as the cold months roll in the condition is caused by a biochemical imbalance in the hypothalamus due to the shortening of daylight hours and the lack of sunlight in winter			1
the lack of light throws off our body clocks , leading to @entity2			0
symptoms include lethargy , sleep problems , loss of libido , anxiety , social problems , depression and craving for carbohydrates and sweet foods			0
for many people @entity2 is a disabling illness , preventing them from functioning normally without continuous medical treatment			0
for others , it is a mild condition causing discomfort but not severe suffering			0
this is known as subsyndromal sad or ' winter blues			1
' it is estimated that a further 17 per cent of the @entity18 population have this milder form of condition			1
source @entity141 ' their figures show that , prior to the pilot , the majority of participants ' responses fell within the moderate - severe to severe depression ( 65.5 per cent )			2
' post-trial only a small minority fell within these categories of depression ( 4.9 per cent ) with the vast majority expressing mild to normal depressive symptoms ( 68.5 per cent )			0
' a spokesman for the @entity8 said : ' the purpose of the alerts was to give them 48 hours ' warning at times when the level of gloominess meant they were at risk of their @entity2 symptoms becoming worse			2
' this would prompt them to use their light boxes and practice the healthy living routines provided in the self - help booklet ' these actions were aimed at reducing the effect of the gloomy weather on their health			1
' they are now discussing whether to roll out the service permanently , as part of their health service which gives guidance to asthma and hayfever sufferers			0
most sufferers show signs of a weakened immune system during the winter , and are more vulnerable to illnesses			2
@entity2 symptoms disappear in spring , either suddenly with a short period of hyperactivity , or gradually , depending on the intensity of sunlight in the spring and early summer			0
in sub-syndromal @entity2 , symptoms such as tiredness , lethargy , sleep and eating problems occur , but depression and anxiety are absent or mild			0
@entity2 may begin at any age but the main age of onset is between 18 and 30 years			0
@entity2 occurs throughout the northern and southern hemispheres but is extremely rare in those living within 30 degrees of the @entity210 , where daylight hours are long , constant and extremely bright .			0

service alerts people when bad weather is rolling in , so they can use light boxes to cheer themselves up
findings show after following @entity8 plan , users reported feeling *happier*
